The Swan Queen fan community is comprised of individuals that collectively \nsupport and celebrate a non-canon romantic relationship between two of the female lead \ncharacters of the show rather than the canonic, heterocentric relationships that occur \nbetween the two women and their respective male love interests. I answer two research \nquestions in this study: First, how are members of the Swan Queen fan community \ndeveloping counter narratives of love by engaging in meaning-making processes and \ninterpretations of OUAT? And secondly, how do they talk about the purpose and \nimportance of their narratives for themselves or the Swan Queen fan community? In \norder to answer my research questions, I consider how the Swan Queen fandom \ndeveloped and how they convey their meaning-making strategies online. To do this, I \nhave analyzed the Tumblr blog of one Swan Queen fan and have used their blog as a \nnexus between other Swan Queen fans that use the website for their fan activities. Swan \nQueen fans argue that the show runners of OUAT use subtextual codes within canonical \nstorylines in an effort to queerbait the show’s queer audience members. Moreover, the \nshow runners refute the notion that they are queerbating queer fans at all by arguing that \nthe fans’ perceptions are baseless and that any perceived queering of the characters \nEmma Swan and Regina Mills is purely “unintentional.” This response has only served to \nalienate the show’s queer fan base further as it led to increased complaints that the show \n\t iv\t\nrunners were gaslighting the entire queer fandom. Additionally, Swan Queen fans \nmaintain that the show’s introduction of canonical storylines featuring romantic \nrelationships between Regina and Robin Hood and Emma and Captain Hook are \nheterosexist and dangerous. The storylines between Emma and Captain Hook, queer fans \nargue, often promote rape culture, thus perpetuating violence against both queer and non-\nqueer audiences through storylines grounded in fairytale concepts of “True Love” and \n“Happily Ever After”. As such, Swan Queen fans push back against and reject this \nviolence through their own interpretations and counter narratives of “True Love”. In \naccordance with previous research, I have found that historically marginalized groups \nsuch as the queer community continue to experience widespread and often aggressive \nattacks by queerphobic individuals and hate groups that are intent on preserving \ntraditionally heterocentric institutions in our society, including (but not limited to) \nmainstream media broadcasting. Furthermore, fandom has become institutionalized in the \nsame manner and typically operates within hegemonic, heterocentric standards. \nConversely, queer fandoms such as the Swan Queen fandom operate outside of these \nstandards, and fans respond to antagonistic efforts to silence them or cast them in an \ninaccurate manner by creating close-knit social communities to combat these actions and \nprovide a space wherein individuals are able to counter dominant narratives that serve to \nfurther marginalize them. This study elucidates how this effort may occur and questions \nthe effect this membership has on those who participate within a queer fandom. It is \nimperative that such research takes place, as there are very few accounts of how queer \nfans navigate the complex intersection between fandom and queerness.  \t\n\t\t \t 1\t\n \n \n \n \n \nI.\tINTRODUCTION\t\n\t\nThis thesis examines a queer fan1 community of the television show Once Upon a Time \n(OUAT; ABC) that utilizes the social networking site Tumblr as their base of fan activity. This \nfandom community is referred to as the “Swan Queen” fandom and is comprised of individuals \nwho collectively support and celebrate a non-canon romantic relationship between the two \nfemale lead characters of the show (Regina and Emma) rather than the canonic, heterocentric \nrelationships that occur in OUAT’s storylines. Specifically, I analyzed the Tumblr blog of one \nSwan Queen fan, wittyoncer2. Using their blog as a nexus between Swan Queen fans, I analyzed \ntext posts from wittyoncer as well as their reblogs from other members in the queer fandom \ncommunity, to which they added their own thoughts and perceptions, thus developing a running \nand continuous dialogue.  \nSwan Queen fans argue that the show runners of OUAT use subtextual codes within \ncanonical storylines in an effort to queerbait the show’s queer audience members (e.g. \nintentionally produce media content that is ambiguous and can then be read queerly that draws \nincreased viewership from queer fans; this is discussed in more detail in Previous Literature). \nMoreover, the show runners refute the notion that they are queerbating queer fans at all by \narguing that the fans’ perceptions of being queerbaited are baseless and that any perceived \nqueering of the characters Emma Swan and Regina Mills is purely “unintentional.” This response \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\tMy use of the terms “queer fans” and “queer fandom” are both in reference to the fans of the Swan \nQueen fandom that I focus my research on from Tumblr, specifically. Additionally, my usage of the term \n“queer” is defined and operationalized as falling outside of the rigid and categorical boundaries of \nheterosexuality (Doty, 1993; Edelman, 1994; Halperin, 1995; Jagose, 1996). 2\tThe blog name “wittyoncer” is a pseudonym used to protect the identity of the Tumblr blog’s author. \nAdditionally, the name “wittyoncer” is available for use here because it is unclaimed on Tumblr.\t\n\t\t 2\t\nhas only served to alienate the show’s queer fan base further as it led to increased complaints that \nthe show runners were gaslighting the entire queer fandom. Additionally, Swan Queen fans \nmaintain that the show’s introduction of canonical storylines featuring romantic relationships \nbetween Regina and Robin Hood and Emma and Captain Hook are heterosexist and dangerous. \nThe storylines between Emma and Captain Hook, queer fans argue, often promote rape culture, \nthus perpetuating violence against both queer and non-queer audiences through storylines \ngrounded in fairytale concepts of “True Love” and “Happily Ever After.” As such, Swan Queen \nfans push back against and reject this violence through their own interpretations and counter \nnarratives of “True Love.” \nRationale and Significance of Study: \nI answer two research questions in this study: First, how are members of the Swan Queen \nfan community developing counter narratives of love by engaging in meaning-making processes \nand interpretations of OUAT? And secondly, how do they talk about the purpose and importance \nof their narratives for themselves or the Swan Queen fan community? \n\t The significance of this work is, I contend, that historically marginalized groups such as \nthe queer community continue to experience widespread and often aggressive attacks by \nqueerphobic individuals and hate groups that are intent on preserving traditionally heterocentric \ninstitutions in our society, including (but not limited to) mainstream media broadcasting. \nFurthermore, fandom has become institutionalized in the same manner and typically operates \nwithin hegemonic heterocentric standards. Conversely, queer fandoms such as the Swan Queen \nfandom operate outside of these standards, and fans respond to antagonistic efforts to silence \nthem or cast them in an inaccurate manner by creating\tclose-knit social communities to combat\t\nthese actions and provide a space wherein individuals are able to counter dominant narratives \n\t\t 3\t\nthat serve to further marginalize them. This study elucidates how this effort may occur and \nquestions the effect this membership has on those who participate within a queer fandom.\tIt is \nimperative that such research takes place, as there are very few accounts of how queer fans \nnavigate the complex intersection between fandom and queerness.  \nIn order to answer my research questions, I consider how the Swan Queen fandom \ndeveloped and how they convey their meaning-making strategies. Swan Queen fans are a \ncommunity based on similar interpretations of OUAT and a commitment to developing counter \nnarratives to the show’s heterocentric “True Love” narrative. Members of the Swan Queen \nfandom who interact on Tumblr may not come from homogenous backgrounds and may not \nshare all of the same types of experiences in life but they do share some, as evident in their \nsimilar interpretations of the show and comparable expressions of counter narratives. Moreover, \nthese fans are of particular interest because of their critiques, meta-analyses, and personal \nexperiences within a multi-character, fantasy-based fandom where inclusivity and gate-keeping \noccur depending on factors such as favorite character, favorite character pairing, or—more \ntangibly—age, sex, gender, race, sexuality, or any combination therein. \n It is these particular actions and interactions by Swan Queen fans that fascinate me. \nFandom, Jenkins explains, is nurtured internally and individualistically but transitions into a \ncollective passion that individuals navigate constantly, (Jenkins, 2012). One individual post or \nreaction to queer-phobic harassment garners immediate attention and support from others within \nthe queer fandom, as the post becomes accessible and viewable as soon as one posts. With this \nimmediacy, it has become clear that online interactions and online fandoms such as the Swan \nQueen fandom are deeply committed to each other as well as the fandom itself. \t  \n\t\t 4\t\n \n \n \n \n \nII.\tPREVIOUS\tLITERATURE \n\t\nThis thesis addresses queer fandom engagement with Once Upon a Time and Swan \nQueen fans’ responses (via an online platform) to the show’s continued lack of queer \nrepresentation in favor of perpetuating heterosexist notions of “True Love” and fairytale \nromance. Researchers\tfrom a wide variety of fields including media studies, feminist and queer \ntheory studies, LGBTQ+ studies, fandom culture studies, and online communication studies have \ntaken up media representation as a topic of study.  \nI begin this literature review by examining the way in which Adrienne Rich’s concept of \ncompulsory heterosexuality (1980) is beneficial to an interrogation of hegemonic notions of love \nand romantic partnership in relation to the concept of “True Love” as it is understood in OUAT. I \nwill then examine the previous literature on media representation and marginalization. Gaye \nTuchman’s notion of symbolic annihilation (1981) proves useful, here, as it provides a \nfoundational concept for much of the literature written on media representation and \nmarginalization. I move on to literature on identity and media representation in order to \nreestablish scholars’ contention that there is still a lack of LGBTQ+ representation that is \npositive and more complex (e.g. non-tokenizing) in order to introduce queer media studies as an \nimportant site of research in queer and lesbian reading practices (Doty, 1993; 2001; Wilton, \n1995; Dobson & Young, 2001). I end with literature on fandom studies (Jenkins, 1992 and 2012) \nand how fandom has changed with the constant introduction of new technologies that make \ncommunicating with each other easier and more convenient (Renninger, 2015). \n\t\t 5\t\nCompulsory Heterosexuality \n Compulsory heterosexuality (Rich, 1980/2003), as a concept, is ideal for this project and \nfeatures greatly in my framework of analysis for the notion of “True Love” as contextualized in \nOUAT. The concept itself is one that acknowledges society's ideological demand of \nheterosexuality in all institutional and/or social settings. Lesbianism, thus, is devalued or erased \nfrom the history of humankind—any and all queerness, as well. In the introduction to the 2003 \nre-publication of Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence, Rich asserts that resistance \nto heterosexual culture and ideological oppression is key: “resistance is a major theme in this \nessay and in the study of women’s lives” (Rich, 2003, pp. 12). \n Rich explains her concerns about the reasons why women's choice of women as romantic \npartners (“comrades,” even), has been rejected or repudiated, thus leading lesbians to hide their \ndesires or remain closeted their whole lives. One of Rich's stronger arguments is that feminist \ntheory needs to address and critique the societal demand for a compulsory heterosexual \norientation for women. By doing this, she argues, all women will benefit (rather than just \nlesbians) because a deconstruction of gendered expectations and marginalization is needed in \norder to reconfigure feminism (Rich, 2003, pp.13). Rich refers to the Western institution of \nheterosexuality itself as “a beachhead of male dominance” (pp. 13). She goes on to suggest that \nheterosexuality needs to be studied as a political institution (pp. 17). Perhaps the part of the essay \nthat is most impactful is when Rich presents and augments Gough's (1971) research on the \ncharacteristics of power routinely held by men, especially highlighting the section regarding \ndenying women [their own] sexuality (pp.18). Rich uses brackets to impart her own additions \nand thoughts to Gough's work throughout this section, including the brief mention of “pseudo-\nlesbian images in the media and literature” (pp. 18). Furthermore, Rich explains that the forms \nby which male power exist and are manifested in society only strengthen the idea for women that \n\t\t 6\t\nthey must fall in love with men and marry and have children (pp. 20). Also of importance, she \nmentions the erasure of lesbian existence and the way in which the exception to this is if such \nlesbian representation is perverse and, as such, oriented for the male audience (pp. 20).  \n Rich states that early indoctrination in “love” as an emotion to be valued and pursued by \nyoung girls may be a Western concept but that a more universalizing ideology of the power and \nimportance of the male sex drive should be addressed in conjunction with the former (pp. 24). \nPerhaps the most succinct expression of Rich's argument comes from Rich, herself: \n“The assumption that “most women are innately heterosexual” stands as a \ntheoretical and political stumbling block for feminism. It remains a tenable \nassumption partly because lesbian existence has been written out of history or \ncatalogued under disease, partly because it has been treated as exceptional \nrather than intrinsic, partly because to acknowledge that for women \nheterosexuality may not be a “preference” at all but something that has had to \nbe imposed, managed, organized, propagandized, and maintained by force is \nan immense step to take if you consider yourself freely and “innately” \nheterosexual” (pp. 27). \n \nAll this is to say that heterosexuality has been imposed on women in multiple ways, \nforcefully and tangentially, but also emotionally, subliminally, and institutionally (Rich, pp. 30). \nFurthermore, Rich’s contributions to the concept of compulsory heterosexuality have inspired \nmany scholars’ keen insights on boundary making. For example, in The Cultural Politics of \nEmotion (2004), Sara Ahmed makes the argument that compulsory heterosexuality determines \nwhich bodies can successfully or “legitimately” approach would-be lovers and which bodies \ncannot (Ahmed, pp. 145). This type of boundary making and marginalization is, of course, \nwithin the purview of those imbedded within a heterodominant society that operates through the \nreproduction of hegemonic standards.\t\n\t\t 7\t\nIdentity and representation in media \n  Media Studies \nIdentity and representation in media has been a broad topic of interest for many media \nstudies scholars over the past three decades and I am specifically concerned here with works on \nthe importance of representation (Gerbner, 1970), depictions of women in media (Tuchman, \n1981), and LGBT representation (Doty, 1993; Wilton, 1995; Dow, 2001; Gross, 2002; Raley & \nLucas, 2006; Gomillion & Giuliano, 2011). Perhaps one of the most beneficial concepts \nconcerning media representation is Gaye Tuchman's 1981 article entitled “Women's Depiction in \nthe Media”. The discussion shares examples in which mainstream media corporations leading up \nthrough the mid-twentieth century actively and purposefully portrayed men (both fictional and \nnon-fictional) as dominant figures while women were portrayed more “traditionally” or, \nsometimes, not at all (Tuchman, 1981). The information most pertinent to the research at hand \nconcerns the actual presence of women, as detailed in the title of the article itself. The presence \nof women on television programs lent to perpetuating stereotypes that were largely harmful to \nthe burgeoning women's liberation movement (Tuchman 1981, pp. 12). This argument further \ndevelops the concept of symbolic annihilation of women in American culture and society (ibid.). \nThe article acknowledges Gerbner's (1970) coinage of the term and contributions, “For, \naccording to Gerbner, just as representation in the media signifies social existence, so too \nunderrepresentation and (by extension) trivialization and condemnation indicate symbolic \nannihilation” (ibid.). Symbolic annihilation, then, is a term used to illustrate the lack of \nrepresentation and/or underrepresentation of a specific group based on their identities (i.e. race, \nage, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, etc.) in media, reinforcing and maintaining social \ninequality on a large-scale social basis. Tuchman’s article closes with two dominant explanations \nof media's sexism: women's position in media organizations and the socioeconomic organization \n\t\t 8\t\nof the media (Tuchman, pp.13). Of particular relevance, Tuchman provides us with a brief \ninterrogation of television writers and the economics of television, stating “[f]or television \nwriters, professionalism includes not offending the networks” (pp. 14). This observation is key in \nthat it suggests that television writers must perform their jobs to the satisfaction of the network \n(and to those who dictate what is appropriate for television audiences), rather than the fans of the \nshow themselves (both queer and non-queer, alike). What, then, can LGBTQ+ individuals do in \nresponse to this “business as usual” attitude in media that focuses purely on compulsory \nheterosexuality? \n Queer Media Studies \nQueer media studies scholars have long been interested in researching how a lack in \nmedia representation affects LGBTQ+ individuals’ overall engagement within a heterodominant \nsociety on a daily basis, theorizing that this continued lack of positive representation leads to \nfurther demoralization and marginalization of queer individuals (Doty, 1993; Wilton, 1995; \nDow, 2001; Gross, 2002; Raley & Lucas, 2006; Gomillion & Giuliano, 2011). In order to \naddress these issues further and to reassert the importance of both identity and representation, it \nis beneficial to consider what is erased or made invisible in society (e.g. compulsory \nheterosexuality) and in media (e.g. symbolic annihilation) separately from how queer individuals \nread, resist, and create fandoms. \n A review of queer media studies literature follows in order to reestablish the argument \nthat LGBTQ+ fans of media do not “turn off” or separate from their identities when actively \nparticipating in fandom. Instead, they may incorporate their own lived experiences and personal \nnarratives into the media content, itself, through engagement with plot lines, characters, and the \nrelationships that said characters develop in a fictional world deconstructed and co-constructed to \nfit queer fans’ needs. \n\t\t 9\t\n\t One\tof the goals of queer media is to challenge traditional beliefs and hegemonic practices \n(i.e. heteronormativity) in relation to media representation (Wilton, 1995, pp. 5). Indeed, popular \nand mainstream television shows began to feature openly gay and lesbian identifying characters \nsuch as Ellen DeGeneres’ eponymous character from Ellen and Will Truman and Jack \nMcFarland from Will & Grace (Gomillion & Giuliano, 2011). However, Raley and Lucas assert \nthat much of this media representation is solely based on stereotypical portrayals of gay and \nlesbian attitudes, desires, and identity (2006). Additionally, the authors contend that the majority \nof LGBTQ+ characterization in media from the 20th century worked to normalize homosexuality \nand present gay and lesbian lifestyles humorously for heterosexual audiences, thus promoting \nhomonormative behavior (Raley & Lucas, 2006). It is largely because of this contention that \nLGBTQ+ individuals seek more accurate and fully developed representation in media, today.  \n Queerbaiting \nIt is well documented that televisual media mirrors the social world and that this \nmirroring frequently occurs in the form of producing and reproducing heterosexist and \nheteronormative shows with predominantly cis-gender, white, straight male and female \nprotagonists/main characters (Gross, 1994; Wilton, 1995; Brooks & Hébert, 2006; Jenkins, \n2012). Therefore, these (re)productions of heterosexist and heteronormative narratives \neffectively minimize and silence any characters who identify as anything but cis-gender, white, \nand straight, effectively controlling who and what can be represented in media (Gerbner, 1979; \nTuchman, 1981; Doty, 1993; Gross, 1994).  \nBeginning in the late 20th century, issues surrounding LGBTQ+ representation in \nmainstream media became central to both activists and scholars who questioned whether the \ncontinued lack of accurate (that is to say, non-stereotypical and non-tokenizing) portrayals of gay \nand lesbian characters was damaging to queer individuals’ perceptions of self (Gross, 1994; \n\t\t 10\t\nKivel & Kleiber, 2000; Gomillion & Giuliano, 2011). The early 2000s presented viewers with a \ndynamically changing media atmosphere—an atmosphere that introduced characters who \nidentified as gay and lesbian (and trans*, in some instances) and lived full and rich fictional lives \nrather than being relegated to the annals of “very special episode” or created specifically to make \nfun of or warn audiences of the “homosexual lifestyle” (Gross, 1994; Raley & Lucas, 2006). The \nsecond decade of the 21st century presents a more complicated situation regarding LGBT+ \ncharacters and representation. Indeed, there is a startling pattern within mainstream media that \nwarrants further attention from scholars: queerbaiting.   \nQueerbaiting, or “multicasting” (Himberg, 2014), has become a fairly common tactic \nused in media, particularly in television shows, and has altered the viewing habits of queer and \nLGBT+ fans’ engagement with media. In this study, the term “queerbaiting” is preferable over \n“multicasting” as the act is discussed as such by Swan Queen fans on Tumblr. Queerbaiting is \ndone intentionally to attract audience members to a television show that identify as queer and/or \nLGBT+ in order to gain their viewership (Brennan, 2016). Series creators queerbait queer and \nLGBT+ audiences with coded moments between two characters of the same gender, which can \nbe (and are) then interpreted as queer. However, these coded-as-queer moments are rarely \nexplicated or followed up with continued, canonized actions between the two characters.  This \nperceived queerness, whether intentional or unintentional, may never become canon in the \ntelevision series because the series’ creators do not wish to pursue the queer romance between \ntheir characters, as this may alienate the series’ heterosexual and/or homophobic fans. \nAdditionally, any queering of a character, in a canonical sense, may be walked back by the \ncreative team of the series (read: erased) in order to appease their straight and homophobic fans. \nQueer Readings \n Academic interests in LGBTQ+ readings of popular media texts have grown rapidly since \n\t\t 11\t\nthe early 1990s yet much of the literature on these readings focuses on either queer readings \n(Doty, 1993; 2001) or lesbian readings (Wilton, 1995; Dobinson & Young, 2000). For example, \nDoty (1993) discusses and attends to queer positions, stating that they can be altered or modified \nover time as people, cultures, and politics change (1993, pp. 8). Rather than framing queer media \nstudies as something to be studied from the outside, Doty promotes readings that are articulated \nfrom within queer discourse(s), built on and around personal queer perspectives on mass \nmedia/culture (pp. 7-8). Doty’s stance on queer readings does not, it seems, categorize queer to \nmean only gay or lesbian self-identity. Rather, queer offers unending possibilities and opposition \nto heterosexism as an institution.  \n By approaching queer readings from a queer position, Doty also works in an effort to \nsuggest that popular media genres such as horror, science fiction, and fantasy are active sites of \n“contrastraight” resistance, stating  \n…[E]veryone's pleasure in these genres is ‘perverse’, is queer, as much of it takes place \nwithin the space of the contraheterosexual and the contrastraight. Just how much \neveryone's pleasures in mass culture are part of this contrastraight, rather than strictly \nantistraight, space— just how queer our responses to cultural texts are so much of the \ntime— is what I'd finally like this essay to suggest (Doty, 1993, pp. 15).  \nThe acknowledgment of the concept that queer moments are received and perceived through the \nscreen by viewers—regardless of the filmmaker's intent—is of importance. As such, Swan \nQueen fans’ queer positions and queer readings of the fantasy show Once Upon a Time, its \nnarrative, and its characters matter greatly. \n Lesbian Readings \n Lesbian media studies and readings, though, differ from queer ones in that they are both a \npart of queer media studies and separate from them. To appropriately examine this project, I \n\t\t 12\t\nhave had to take up both queer media studies and lesbian media studies and consider their \nsimilarities as well as their differences. Wilton takes up Doty’s notion of queer positions/queer \nreadings and further explains that the making of lesbian meaning is a “contested process” that is \ndetermined both by lesbian perceptions and non-lesbian ones (Wilton, 1995, pp. 5). Most \nstrikingly, Wilton discusses lesbian readings and firmly states as fact that lesbians cannot \nseparate themselves, or be separated from, their socio-political contexts (Wilton, 1995, pp. 13-\n14). While I agree with Wilton’s argument, her specific focus on lesbian readings is largely \nlocated within a time and place in which identity politics broadly shaped academic conversations \non the topic. I find it difficult to consider the Swan Queen community as a lesbian fandom rather \nthan a queer fandom mainly because it could be that some community members do not choose to \nidentify themselves as lesbians or within the LGBTQ+ moniker at all. \nPrevious research supports the concept that lesbians read texts or scenes (in the case of \ntelevision and other visual media) through a “specific set of codes apparently undiscerned by \nother audiences” (Hinds, 1992, pp. 65; Doty, 1993; Wilton, 1995). These lesbian readings of \ntexts are further positioned within academic scholarship thanks in large part to the work of \nDobinson and Young (2000). The authors' research interrogates 20th century popular cinematic \nfilms and lesbian interpretive strategies in response to dominantly heterosocial and heterosexual \nmedia. This meaning making can be observed in the ways in which active lesbian audiences \nperceive scenes in media and relate them to experiences in their lives, “[R]ather, lesbian \nreadings, and, therefore, interpretive communities, contain a degree of heterogeneity; their \nbearers bring unique personal experiences to reception that shape aspects of their responses in \nequally unique ways” (Dobinson & Young, 2000, pp. 100). These readings have been referred to \nas being “against the grain” (Dobinson & Young, pp. 101). The benefit in referring to lesbian \n\t\t 13\t\nreadings as “against the grain” is that it signals the fact that there is a distinct and oppositional \nstrategy to that of the heterosocial reading. The authors continue, “[W]e were also interested in \nthe way in which such strategies may grow out of and reciprocally impact broader social \nexperiences. In other words, while our primary focus was the practice of making meaning, we \nwere also concerned with how such practice is related to lesbian lives and forms of social \nstratification outside [the movie theatre]” (Dobinson & Young, pp. 105).  \nDobinson and Young conclude that lesbians are active viewers of media that constantly \nexcludes or otherwise stereotypes lesbian existence and that they form their own interpretation \nstrategies of media that allows for a continuation in viewership (Dobinson & Young, 2000, pp. \n98). Building off of the authors' conclusions, I examine what happens when Swan Queen fans of \nOUAT watch the show, interpret the medium’s message, and engage in meaning-making \nprocesses that produce counter narratives to the show’s notion of “True Love.” In so much as the \nway members of the Swan Queen fandom choose to identify themselves and each other, this \nfandom is a queer one. Whether they identify as lesbian or not, they belong to a queer fandom \nbecause the fandom and its active participants reject and oppose the show’s hegemonic and \nmainstream narratives, as well as the fan culture built around these narratives, in an effort to \nillustrate how damaging the show’s concept of “True Love” is for those who fall outside of the \nrigid category of cis-gender heterosexuality.  \nFandom Studies  \nFandom can be best understood as a complex and dynamic process one navigates on a \nday-to-day basis. On an individual level, identifying as a fan and feeling a sense of belonging to \na particular fandom allows for a deep and intimate affect to develop. Jenkins (2012) maintains \nthat simply “being a fan of something” and calling oneself a fan and “claiming membership to a \nsubculture” are separated by the act of meaning-making, as this act is “deeply social” (pp. xiv). \n\t\t 14\t\nThus, any individual fan engaging in the deeply social process of meaning making also belongs \nto a fandom community alongside others who engage in the same process. The idea of fandom as \na community is not a new one and there is excellent research on the matter of both hegemonic \nfandoms and counterhegemonic fandoms (Penley, 1997; Grey, 2007; Bennett, 2010).  \nEstablishing Queer Fandom \nIn addressing counterhegemonic fandoms, I find it useful and necessary to consider them \nas queer fandoms. Chad Bennett (2010) developed an understanding of the term “queer fandom” \nby linking Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s (2003) ideas of queer existence, shame, and the inherent \ncoexistence of both in queer lived experiences to Jenkins’ fandom theory (2012). As such, \nBennett arrives at the conclusion that fandom is filled with levels of inherent shame and, ergo, \nthere is “something queer about fandom in general” (Bennett 2010, 18-19). However, I do not \nagree completely with Bennett in regards to the significance of shame within queer fandom, as it \nis clear that fandom practices have changed with the shift in online presence and online practices \nvia social network systems (Jenkins, 2012). This is a positive shift in that that there are now \nmany different ways to engage in online fandom participation, as opposed to the few available \ntwenty years ago, when internet socializing first became popular. Thus, it is possible that Swan \nQueen fans, faced with little to no positive representation within mainstream media, have created \nonline communities in which they feel safe to celebrate difference, co-create fan media (such as \nfan fiction, fan art, poetry, etc.), and collaborate with others in their community about fan theory, \nmeta commentary, or critiques of their favorite show. By engaging in these processes, Swan \nQueen fans may experience a sense of belonging and bonding among their online cohort that \nthey rarely feel in their daily lives, be it in school, at work, at home among family, or somewhere \nelse within the social world.\t \t\n\t\n\t\t 15\t\n\t Online Community and Communication  \n Bryce Renninger (2015) researches online community spaces used by asexual individuals, \nidentifying theoretical and practical advantages and, more importantly, disadvantages to the use \nof Tumblr and reddit. Expanding upon boyd’s (2011) explanations of SNSs (social networking \nsites) as networked publics, the author creates a model for further understanding the social \ndynamics within Tumblr and reddit—as they are unique examples of counterpublic \ncommunication among individuals who consider themselves outside of the dominant public \nsphere. Counterpublics, in Warner’s perspective, are those that oppose the public, “a kind of total \nsociality” (Warner, 2002, pp. 49). Therefore, counterpublics enable individuals or groups to \nproduce and disseminate alternative discourse narratives and directly counter the total \n(normative) sociality of hegemonic ideology. \n Renninger (2015) works with and adapts Madinaou and Miller’s (2013) theory of \npolymedia environment, using the example of counterpublic communication about asexuality \nidentity among the online community spaces created on Tumblr and reddit. The focus of the \narticle remains largely on the SNS Tumblr and details the way in which technological and \ntechnosocial affordances such as the “Ask Box” on Tumblr lend to “trolling” and animosity \namong members of different “parts” of Tumblr. The author chose to focus on Tumblr because it \n“was seen as a place for vibrant activity among asexuals” during research (Renninger, pp. 1515). \nEngaging with Fraser’s research on subaltern counter publics (1990), Renninger contends that \ncounterpublic communication among asexuals and asexual allies about asexuality serves two \npurposes: to work out ideas related to identity, community, and relationships and provide \nopportunity to develop tactics to assert and/or adapt identities within the large social sphere (pp. \n1516). \t\n \t\n\t\t 16\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nIII.\tMETHODOLOGY\t\n \nI have focused my research on a community of queer fans of the show OUAT who have \ndeveloped an online space via the website Tumblr to actively participate in their fandom. By \ndoing so, they are able to further engage in creating counter narratives of love in response to the \ncanonical heteronormative storylines, character representation, and romantic relationships said \ncharacters enter into. The goal of this research is to examine the ways in which Swan Queen fans \nalternatively interpret the text of the show using their own lived experiences and perspectives \nand engage in the process of creating their own sharable texts and media online that question or \noutright reject the dominant discourses of heteronormativity and compulsory heterosexuality. \nIn order to discuss fandom participation, there must be an establishing ground for those \nwho are not familiar with the show or the show's plot lines. ABC’s hit television show, Once \nUpon a Time, is the re-imagining of classic fairy tales from Disney and other fictional worlds \nthat take place in modern-day Maine, and follow the lives of such fabled fairy tale characters as \nSnow White and her Prince Charming, The Evil Queen, and many others (classic and \ncontemporary) as well as original characters who become part of the story itself. The show \npremiered October 23, 2011, to high ratings and positive audience reception.  \nTumblr as a platform and queer fandom practices  \n In order to accomplish this project, I employed a qualitative content analysis of data from a \nspecific blog from the website Tumblr (Mitra, 2010). Tumblr is an ideal platform for study \nbecause of the variety of users on the website as well as the variety of ways in which the site can \nbe customized to fit individual needs, wants, and desires (Zappavigna, 2013; Renninger, 2015, \n\t\t 17\t\npp. 1515-1516). Specific to the purposes of this project, Tumblr is useful to observe queer \nfandom practices. The website provides LGBTQ+ fans the space in which they can communicate \ntheir thoughts, reactions, and emotions about their fandom away from the rest of their social and \npublic arenas of interaction, thus creating online queer counterpublics (Warner, 2002; Berlant & \nWarner, 2013).  \n Renninger (2015) states, “Counterpublic address allows those that lie outside of \nsanctioned publics to map their own ideologies, thoughts, and subjectivities among people, \nmostly strangers, that share an awareness of similar countercultural referents” (pp. 1526). Using \nthis concept, it is possible to build upon Jenkins’ (1992/2012) research on fandom practices in \norder to show that Swan Queen fans use Tumblr to resist the dominant, hegemonic narratives \npresented through mainstream media that reproduce the tenets of Rich’s (1980/2003) compulsory \nheterosexuality. \nThe data comprise of blog posts and subsequent “reblogs” by the blogger wittyoncer. \nWittyoncer is one of the most prominent members of the Swan Queen community and is an \nactive participant within the Tumblr fandom. The blogger is a prolific fan media producer who \nparticipates by contributing fan fiction, fan theories, and meta commentaries. Furthermore, they \nare an active and engaging member of the SQ community largely because they interact and \ncollaborate with other members by reblogging and commenting on other fans’ posts. Crucial to \nconsider, as well, is the way that fans of Swan Queen interact with wittyoncer’s Tumblr posts. \nTheir individual Tumblr blog posts can be considered to be a corpus of multiple discussions and \ncommunication threads, providing evidence of their specific popularity (Zappavigna, 2013). \nThese interactions are critical to my analysis because they illustrate the ways in which online \nfandom members and groups communicate and strengthen relationships with one another \n\t\t 18\t\n(Zappavigna, 2013). Wittyoncer has a blog that is open to public access, meaning that anyone \ncan search their “name” online and access their Tumblr profile page and scroll through their past \nposts. There is also an option to search through their archived posts. Taken together, these factors \nand options were extremely useful tools for the type of qualitative, textual analysis of this \nproject.  \nTime Frame and Data Collection \nRather than directing my data collection towards OUAT’s overall broadcast history and \nairtime, I focus my attention towards a particular “jumping-off” point during seasons three and \nfour (2013-14), wherein the character of Killian Jones, alias “Captain Hook,” is introduced as the \nnew love interest for Emma Swan and Robin Hood is introduced as the love interest of Regina \nMills/The Evil Queen. Thus, I looked at wittyoncer’s blog posts that coincide with these plot \nlines ranging from March 2014 to December 2014. \nI chose this specific timeframe and point in the plot of the television show because the \nactions of the production crew and responses from the general audience during this time are \ncrucial and can be directly and tangibly linked to a significantly large portion of OUAT’s \nLGBTQ+ fans’ increasing discontent and anger towards the writers’ and producers’ cohesive \nrejection of a fan-created petition on Twitter for the show to be more LGBTQ+ inclusive (via \nexploring a queer romance between Emma and Regina). The introduction of Hook as Emma’s \nnew love interest and Robin Hood as Regina’s sparked outrage among LGBTQ+ fans of Swan \nQueen, in particular. The outrage and anger of these fans can largely be found in Tumblr posts \nand, as such, these serve as one of the foci for analysis. Wittyoncer, in particular, engages in \nmultiple conversations and discussions with other fans during this time frame in regards to the \n“True Love” trope supported by the show’s script and canon that many LGBTQ+ fans found to \nbe heteronormative and non-inclusive.  \n\t\t 19\t\nMethodology, Framework, and IRB \nOnce the data were gathered, I performed a qualitative content analysis of the discourse \nprovided through the discussions between wittyoncer and other Swan Queen fans on Tumblr \n(Mayring, 2000; Mitra, 2010). Using Mayring’s deductive category application (2000), I \nexamined the data in search of categories and subcategories that I have developed in accordance \nwith my research questions. I have created explicit definitions for each category throughout the \ncoding process. My initial categories were: 1) Complete rejection of OUAT storylines/narratives; \n2) Development of counter narratives; 3) Reluctant acceptance of OUAT storylines/narratives; \nand 4) Complete hope for and belief in Swan Queen being “endgame” for the show.  \nI then coded the data by using these categories. For example, a code for the first category \n(Complete rejection of OUAT storylines/narratives) are instances in which Swan Queen fans \nexpress their anger at the show, its writers, and, perhaps, even other fans of the show. Another \nexample of coding for this category may be evident in instances where Swan Queen fans make \nclaims that they will no longer be members of the fandom because of the emotional toll the show \nand the Tumblr fandom, itself, has taken on them. Moving to the second category (Developing \ncounter narratives), an example code is Swan Queen fan meta and/or fan fiction, of which \nencapsulates both authorship and readership. A code that highlights the third category (Reluctant \nacceptance of OUAT storylines/narratives) is ambivalence and fans’ willingness to endure the \nshow’s plotlines and continued reliance on heteronormative romance narratives. Lastly, a code \nfor the final category (Complete hope for and belief in Swan Queen being “endgame” for the \nshow) is found in instances where Swan Queen fans remain positively engaged in the fandom \nand believe that Emma and Regina are going to fall in love during the show’s airing, thus \nbecoming canon rather than just “fanon.”  Afterwards, I revised my categories based on any \n\t\t 20\t\ndiscrepancies within the data and after checking for reliability. I then worked through the text \nonce more, solidifying my categories and themes and, finally, interpreted the results.  \nI also focused, in part, on Tumblr hashtags, as they are useful tools for research \n(Zappavigna, 2015; Renninger, 2015). I was primarily interested in hashtags developed by \nwittyoncer and used in their blog posts. These particular hashtags are used to critique the show’s \nplot/characterization or otherwise call out the marginalization or queer silencing/queer \nharassment of queer fans of the show and often pertain to these fans’ personal narratives and \nreactions. \nThis project met the guidelines for IRB exemption, as I have not communicated directly \nwith Swan Queen bloggers at any point during data collection or analysis. Nor have I \ninterviewed, surveyed, or polled any other members of the online fandom community. \nFurthermore, I do not intend to discuss or otherwise reveal wittyoncer’s or any of the other \nbloggers’ personal information (i.e. out them) in this or any future project I may choose to \nundertake.  \nAssumptions/My own biases and reflexivity: \n I operate with the assumption that fandoms such as the Swan Queen fandom are a large, \ndiverse group of individuals who co-create, co-construct, and co-author original pieces of \nartistry, meta-analyses, and critiques of OUAT itself but also fandom as a whole. As such, it is \ncrucial to state my positionality within this project. I consider myself to be a member of queer \nfandom and have watched the first four seasons of OUAT. In the past, I have participated in the \nSwan Queen fandom on Tumblr, having posted, reblogged, and communicated with others \nwithin the fandom off and on for the last four years. In that time, I have observed unique shifts in \nthe Swan Queen fandom on Tumblr that have greatly inspired me to research queer fandom more \nbroadly.   \n\t\t 21\t\n \n \n \n \n \nIV.\tFINDINGS \n \nI have spent the majority of my time over the past two years considering a specific queer \nfandom, the Swan Queen fandom, in order to address and answer my research questions in this \nthesis: 1) How are members of the Swan Queen fan community developing counter narratives of \nlove by engaging in meaning-making processes and interpretations of OUAT? And 2) How do \nthey talk about the purpose and importance of their narratives for themselves or the Swan Queen \nfan community? Below, I begin by elucidating on the Swan Queen fandom’s development and \ninitial purpose before I turn to my first research question. \nResearch Question 1: Redefining Fairytales? \nThe Swan Queen fandom on the social network platform, Tumblr, was constructed \ninitially as an online/virtual space for primarily queer and lesbian fans of OUAT to share and \ndiscuss their perceptions of the show and talk about their queer and often-times resistant readings \nand interpretations of the relationship between Emma and Regina, thus creating a queer fandom \nbased on a non-canonical sexual and/or romantic relationship between two female characters on \na show structured around fairytales, “True Love,” and “Happily Ever After.” I will now focus on \nresults found while analyzing the narratives of Swan Queen fans via text posts written and \ncollaboratively discussed on Tumblr in an effort to answer my first research question. I begin by \ndiscussing how Swan Queen fans interpreted Once Upon A Time’s purpose as a television series \nand what they believed the creators were setting out to accomplish (i.e. create a modernized \nfairytale). \nAccording to the text posts on Tumblr, a majority of Swan Queen fans believe that OUAT \n\t\t 22\t\nwas created in order to present its audience modern-day re-imaginings of fairytales that \nchallenge what we know about the concepts of “Happily Ever After” and “True Love,” thus \nactively participating in a progressive project. Below, wittyoncer has reblogged3 a quote from an \narticle from FemPop Magazine that indicates that many fans of the show understood that its \nmission, from the beginning, was to expand upon well-known notions of traditional fairytales \nand develop a new framework of “Happily Ever After” that could thrive in our modern lives \nwhile also complicating hegemonic ideas of “True Love” narratives in media. \n“To take the relationship from a simmering subtext to \nblatant main text is completely in line with the show’s \nmission to redefine fairytales and dole out happy endings \nlike candy. Two ladies uniting in love for their son (and \npossibly each other yes please) is just a logical as hell next \nstep. And if that ISN’T the next step than (sic) someone \nsomewhere in the production process screwed up because \nthere are scenes on Buffy where two lesbians do magic as \nan honest to God metaphor for sex that were less blatant \nthan that moment.” (Emphasis mine). \n \nThe quote above supports the general understanding of the show that the creators of the \nseries hoped to convey to audience members.4 The author of the article discusses the show’s \nmission being that of “redefining fairytales” (FemPop Magazine). As such, the quote further \nexplicates that it would be reasonable for the show to introduce a canon romantic relationship \nbetween Emma and Regina as a step towards rejecting traditional narratives and redefining \nfairytales. Additionally, the author of the article compares the scenes between Emma and Regina \nin which they perform magic together to similar scenes between Tara and Willow from Joss \nWhedon’s series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This is a particularly insightful comparison as Tara \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n3 All quotes discussed are found on wittyoncer blog and are either original posts or ones that have been reblogged by \nwittyoncer from other Swan Queen fans on Tumblr. \n4 Co-creator of the series, Adam Horowitz, has discussed during interviews that the idea for the show was to take the \ncharacters from fairytales that we know and “try to find things about them that we haven’t explored before.” \nFurthermore, Horowitz emphasizes that they are “not generally retelling the exact same story as the fairy tale \nworld.” Quotes taken from an October 15th 2011 interview with Karl Keily for NYCC (New York Comic Con). \n\t\t 23\t\nand Willow are canonically queer characters that fell in love over several seasons and used their \npowers to save the world. The comment about magic as an allusion to sex refers to the popular \ntrope detailing magic as an inherent trait rather than something external one experiences, thus the \nease in which writers such as Whedon are able to liken sexual orientation or sexual exploration \nwith a member of the same sex to learning to control and use one’s magic.  \nWittyoncer reblogs this quote and adds a small note reading, “THIS. also, LOL-ing.” \nThis additional comment signals that wittyoncer appreciates and agrees with the author’s \nperspective and is amused by the comparison between the two shows and their characters’ \nrelationships. Additionally, it may also be argued that this fan is amused by the article and the \nauthor’s take on the entire situation as it unfolded—the author seems exasperated by the lack of \nsimilar queering in OUAT as the show’s narrative progressed from one season to the next. I \nbelieve that wittyoncer’s amusement lies in a place of mutual exasperation and that they can, in \npart, find humor in both the article’s tone (i.e. sarcasm and biting wit that calls out the person(s) \nin production who “screwed up”) as well as in the distinct lack of any “progress” made by a \nshow interested in redefining fairytales. \n As such, it became clear to me while analyzing the data that many within the Swan \nQueen fandom voiced their opinion that Once Upon a Time has not succeeded in creating the \nprogressive re-imagining of fairytales it set out to do. Below, a text post illustrates a Swan Queen \nfan’s anger towards the show’s continued reliance on traditional fairytale romance tropes (i.e. \n“True Love”). \n“Now, I’m not saying that I expect Swan Queen to become \ncanon. I sadly don’t and I wish I did, I wish I had \neveryone’s hopes and dreams, but I can’t. Not when OUAT \nis telling me and showing me, again and again, how all \nthese white male-female couples are True Loves and belong \ntogether. My brain adheres to logic and, even if OUAT \n\t\t 24\t\ndistinctly lacks such a quality, it sure has been consistent in \nthe shared traits of all its True Love pairings.” (Emphasis \nmine) \t\n In the quote above, the fan addresses the common and shared hope that many Swan \nQueen fans have in regards to the relationship becoming canon on the show. However, this fan \nremains cynical about Swan Queen ever becoming fully realized on the show because, to them, \nthe show’s primary focus and celebration of heterosexist and heteronormative relationships far \nexceeds any possibility for queering the characters, thus reproducing the notion that only \nheterosexual white couples are privileged in that they can find “True Love” together. Here, we \nsee that some fans are unhappy or frustrated with the lack of character diversity and the lack of \nnew, queer narratives of “True Love” in the show. However, while this fan goes as far as saying \nthat they do not expect Swan Queen to happen, they do not call out or demand for the show’s \ncreators to rectify their canon narrative to include a queer “Happily Ever After.” As such, this \ntext remains situated in a space meant to identify one of the problems Swan Queen fans face \nrather than towards fan activism5 (Jenkins, 2013).  \nSimilarly, a second text post by a different Swan Queen fan emphasizes obstacles they \nfeel the entire queer fandom face when trying to actively participate in their fan practices. This \nfan discusses the ways in which they feel discouraged to voice their opinion by those outside of \nthe queer fandom. Furthermore, the fan addresses an explicit sense of heterosexism encountered \nby queer fandom members wherein they are told, by multiple parties, that their ship is not a \nviable option for the show to pursue: \n“When a fan says ‘I really, really want Swan Queen to \nbecome canon because they’re two strong, dynamic, \nbeautiful women who have an important role on their show \nand I think it’s about time that the morals of fairytales \nexpanded to include same-sex couples in their definition of \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n5 I will return to the concept of fan activism later in my analysis. \n\t\t 25\t\nTrue Love, too’, they don’t want to hear that it’s not going \nto happen because it would be too weird. Because that is \nthe very thing that they are hoping to discourage.” \n(Emphasis mine) \n \nThis quote very neatly summarizes one of the stronger notions held by queer fans that \nsupports canonizing the Swan Queen relationship. Beyond asking the show’s creative team to \nconsider the possibility of Swan Queen as a romantic relationship, this individual speaks for \nothers within the queer fandom in an effort to quell the types of obstructive responses by other \nfans of the show opposing the notion of a queer “True Love” between Emma and Regina, who \nwill be addressed as “anti-Swan Queen fans.”  In fact, they go so far as to state that the definition \nof “True Love,” as touted by fairytale narratives and reproduced in the show, should become \nmore expansive towards same-sex romantic relationships. For me, there is a distinct focus here \non both the definition for “True Love” and the parameters of the “morals of fairytales.” “True \nLove” (in the sense that this particular fan understands it) represents more of a symbolic ideal, \ndeveloped over time by Western sociocultural practices, that has transformed into a trope in \nstorytelling narratives that celebrate romantic love above all else. Moreover, the “morals of \nfairytales” prove quite fascinating because the phrasing indicates that the fan already interprets \nthat there are, indeed, morals in play where fairytale narratives and the discourse surrounding \nfairytale endings are concerned and that these morals work to keep queer romances and notions \nof “True Love” out of fairytales entirely. Next, I address and answer my first research question \nby turning to the ways in which Swan Queen fans push back against this moralistic gatekeeping \nand develop counter narratives of “True Love” by engaging in meaning-making processes and \ninterpretations of the show. \n(1) Developing Counter Narratives of “True Love”  \nSwan Queen fans develop counter narratives of “True Love” in the show via their \n\t\t 26\t\nengagement within fandom. The majority of the fans in the Swan Queen fandom disagree with \nthe storylines that developed in season 3 and created their own counter narratives (1) based upon \ntheir queer readings and interpretations of Regina and Emma’s characters, their interactions with \none another, etc. Additionally, these queer fans (2) bond based on their similar interpretations of \nthe show and discuss their reasons for shipping Swan Queen together. Most importantly, the \nSwan Queen fandom developed out of opposition to the show runners’ continued focus on \nheterosexist representations of “True Love” and “Happily Ever After.” As such, (3) Swan Queen \nfans reject the show’s narratives of these two notions through rejection of the canonical “Captain \nSwan” (CS) and “Outlaw Queen” (OQ) relationships and push for more inclusive storylines and \nrelationships such as the one they support between Emma and Regina. \nI found that Swan Queen fans develop their fandom based upon similar queer readings \nand interpretations of Regina and Emma’s characters, their interactions with one another, and \nthrough direct dialogue/context from the show. Online, it is very easy to share one’s own \nthoughts and opinions to an extensive group of individuals located around the globe (Renninger, \n2012; Jenkins, 2013). Through Tumblr, Swan Queen fans are able to perform these actions and \ndiscuss their own thoughts and perceptions of the show. These individual perceptions, once \nshared with others throughout the Swan Queen fandom, allow fans to encounter others who \nprescribe to similar or even the same perceptions. This is how a fandom base begins to develop \nand situate itself in its own context (Jenkins, 1992 & 2012; Bennett, 2010; Grey, 2007). Below, a \ntext post by a Swan Queen fan, followed by subsequent responses from others, illustrates how \none fan’s perceptions and queer reading of a scene between Regina and Emma on the show is \nshared with others in the online fandom:  \n“ok if this is ‘unintentional’ someone needs to tell Lana,the \ndirector, and the fucking editor, because if Swan Queen is \n\t\t 27\t\nnot a thing fine, but that last shot makes NO sense if there \nisn’t some underlying feelings that are NOT \nplatonic, because Lana could have had Regina look AWAY \nand nod and look sad and thoughtful, but NO, she looks at \nEMMA, aND THEY DO THE FUCKING ZOOM OF \nETERNAL LOVE, fuck this show”  \n \nThe original poster of this quote expresses their exasperation towards the show’s creative \nteam in the wake of the show runners’ “official” explanation of the emotionally charged scenes \nbetween Emma and Regina during the show’s first and second seasons wherein they state that \nany perceived romantic or sexual undertones between the two characters were “unintentional”. \nThis is incredibly important because the fan is disagreeing with the show runners’ argument and \nthe way that they responded to queer fans’ readings, questioning why the scene discussed in the \npost made it past the cutting room floor if the relationship’s elements, readily perceived as queer \nby Swan Queen fans, were not produced intentionally. The poster even emphasizes the show’s \nuse of a common trope, “The Rom-Com Zoom,” in a scene between Emma and Regina, as \npotential evidence of the very act of intentionality the show runners deny having taken part in. \nThe fan ends their post with “fuck this show,” illustrating that they are frustrated and angry at \nhow the show runners present a queer potentiality via the “Rom-Com Zoom” trope yet reinsures \nto hetero audiences that such moments are “unintentional”6. The language, rhetoric, and use of \nrandom capitalization within the fan’s text post illustrates a high level of emotionality on the \nsubject, conveying that this fan acknowledges that Swan Queen may never happen in the show \nbut that they also defend their right as a fan to read scenes between Emma and Regina using their \nqueer perspective. \nAnother fan reblogs and adds their own commentary to the original poster’s text, “No one \nholds eye contact for that long with their friends. Or enemies. Or whatever. This is love man.” I \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n6 I will discuss more on the topic of queer baiting in the latter half of my Findings section. \n\t\t 28\t\ninterpret this additional commentary as agreement with the original poster’s queer interpretation \nof the scenes between Regina and Emma. Moreover, this fan qualifies the looks that have been \nread in a queer perspective as love. Subsequent to this fan’s remarks, wittyoncer adds, “this \ncommentary is epic and spot-on.” It is clear, then, that these three fans have similar readings of \nscenes between the two characters and challenge the show runners’ narrative.  \nThis text post thread represents a common sort of grappling queer fans of media take on \nthemselves: wading through and attempting to discern subtext from “main” text. Queer readings \nstem from a margin, as there was little to no “main” text addressing queer characterization from \nwhich to glean from the films and television shows produced in the 20th century. This margin \ncarries over to queer fandom practices today because, while there are many more examples of \nqueer representation in media7, many of these representations are problematic and tend to mirror \nthe tokenized queer individual seen in media during the 1990’s and early 2000’s. Thus, in the \nmargins, queer fans develop their ideas, passions, and ultimately, their fandom around subtext. I \nnow turn to an analysis on the reasons why Swan Queen fans ship Emma and Regina together. \n(2) Shipping Swan Queen \nAs discussed above, these queer fans bond with one another based on their similar \ninterests in and interpretations of the show. I believe that this enables them to discuss their \nreasons for shipping Swan Queen on Tumblr, which the majority of them perceive as being an \nopen and welcoming space to engage in their fandom practices. In this space Swan Queen fans \nhave developed and nurtured complex and various desires that drive them to ship Emma and \nRegina together romantically. In this text post, wittyoncer discusses some of them and \nestablishes that there may be too many to account for: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n7 Statistics from GLAAD report that 2016 saw the highest number of LGBTQ+ characters represented on television. \nSource: https://www.glaad.org/whereweareontv16 \n\t\t 29\t\n“OQ and CS as populations are substantially young \nheterosexual women who eroticize the male halves of the \ncouples and/or identify with the female halves and want \nthat story for themselves. this is why conversations about \nany problematic issues in those ships go nowhere. \nnow, that’s not to say SQers don’t eroticize Emma or \nRegina, cuz many of us do, but not as universally or \nconsistently. there’re people who are in it for queer \nrepresentation, people who are in it because they think it’s \nan epic story, people who have nuanced understandings \nthat there are issues but think they can be overcome … \nalmost as many positions as people.” \n(Emphasis mine) \n \nHere, wittyoncer discusses how they perceive the OQ and CS fandoms to be made up of \nyoung women who identify as heterosexual thus creating a contrast between these heterocentric \nships and Swan Queen as a queer ship. There is an emphasis towards the act of compulsory \nheterosexuality (i.e. eroticizing the male half and idolizing/identifying with the female halves of \nthe ships) that prevents these fans from having a productive exchange with Swan Queen fans \nabout problematic issues perceived as being dangerous to perpetuate in the “modern-day” \nfairytales that the show creates.  \nImportantly, wittyoncer makes clear that some Swan Queen fans do eroticize Emma or \nRegina but that it happens less consistently than in the above-mentioned fandoms and that the \nSwan Queen fandom should be seen as being comprised of “almost as many positions as people” \nwithin the community. I interpret this as meaning that individuals found themselves drawn to this \nonline queer fandom for numerous reasons. As such, this post supports my argument that Swan \nQueen fans have found in Tumblr a space, or as Berlant and Warner (1998) discuss, a queer \ncounterpublic, where they feel free to express their “desires” and reasons for participating in \ntheir queer fandom. Next, I discuss some of these reasons why Swan Queen fans ship the two \ncharacters together, as demonstrated by text posts from fans explaining it in their own words.   \n\t\t 30\t\nReasons For Shipping Swan Queen \nIt became clear to me during analysis that Swan Queen fans believe that a romantic \nrelationship between Emma and Regina should be made canonical in the show based upon two \nvery specific arguments: a) It makes sense, narrative-wise, and b) Because they share a son and \nhave already begun to develop as a family. I will discuss each in more detail below.  \nA. “It’s just a compelling connection.” \nAccording to the text posts I analyzed, many Swan Queen fans believe that a romantic \nrelationship between Emma and Regina could/should be canonical based on their perceptions of \nthe show’s over-arching narrative, stating that it makes sense to have the two women fall in love \nafter everything they have experienced together. The text post that follows elucidates how one \nfan, in particular, sees the Swan Queen ship set apart from the canonical, heterosexual ships: \n“Possibly the thing I love most about the swanqueen \nshippers is that nobody told us to ship this. All the other \nships on this show are here because somebody told people \nto ship it. Outlaw queen with the pixie dust, captain swan \nwith the “hook is in love with her” and swanfire because he \nis henrys father. Nobody told SQ to ship it (seriously \neverybody has been telling us not to). We can just see the \ndevelopment between two characters and understand that it \nmakes sense for them to be together. its kinda awesome” \n \n \nThe post speaks to the fan’s appreciation of the ship and its fandom and discusses the \nways in which Swan Queen evolved organically, built on the audience seeing the development \nbetween the two characters and understanding “that it makes sense for them to be together.” \nImportantly, this fan also makes clear that “nobody” told them to ship Swan Queen and how \n“everybody has been telling us not to” ship them. I interpret this to mean that Swan Queen fans \nfeel that they have been castigated for their participation within the larger and more general \nfandom for the show. Additionally, this posts demonstrates the queer fan’s belief that the \n\t\t 31\t\ncanonical ships were specifically created and heavily promoted by the show runners and ABC’s \nPR team, framing them as being the “right” types of romances to ship. By doing so in this \nmanner, the show’s “True Love” narrative undermines queer fans’ subjectivity when navigating \ntheir own complex relationships to both the show and its larger, hegemonic fandom.  \nWittyoncer comments on the post, saying that the other ships have to rely on the show \nrunners “hitting [viewers] over the head with them” or being “spoonfed exposition” so that they \ndo make sense. Here, wittyoncer implies that they think the plots for the canon romances are \nmere contrivances that require more unnecessary work for the writers than any potential romance \nbetween Emma and Regina would. Additionally, wittyoncer states that Swan Queen is \n“compelling,” echoing the shared belief that Outlaw Queen and Captain Swan are anything but—\nthat there is nothing interesting or new about these romances that has not already been seen in \nstorytelling. Swan Queen, however, offers these prospects for wittyoncer and other fans in the \nqueer fandom and present new iterations of fairytale romance based off of the traditional \nnarratives used in the show on a regular basis. I now shift my focus to Swan Queen fans’ \nperceptions of the “Swan-Mills family” and the fan-generated argument that Swan Queen makes \nsense based on this family structure. \nB.  “Henry Has Two Moms” \n In a longer, more detailed text entry entitled “Henry Has Two Moms and other stuff I’m \nthinking about,” the original poster explains that they think the overarching reason for Swan \nQueen to be “endgame” is that both women are Henry’s mothers and that the show would be \ndoing a great disservice to same-sex couples and female-headed households if the show runners \nwillfully ignore or reject the potential of a “Happily Ever After” featuring Emma, Regina, and \ntheir son. \n\t\t 32\t\n “Swan Queen is more than a ship, it’s a movement. We’ve \nbeen saying this since the idea of Emma ‘Swan’ and the \nEvil ‘Queen’ came onto our television screens… and also \nnot long after we all sort of sat down and said…well, Henry \ndoes have two moms…they look at each other like they \nwant to rip each other’s silk shirts to shreds and at the end \nof the day, HENRY HAS TWO MOMS and that ain’t no \njoke. And if Swan Queen isn’t endgame? They’ll have \nmade a joke of same-sex headed families. It isn’t a joke, \nnot when studies show how healthy female headed \nhouseholds are. Not when same-sex couples are fighting so \nhard for their rights, not when women are still paid less \nthan men… HENRY HAS TWO MOMS cannot end in any \nway other than for Emma and Regina to be together, as co-\nparents and yes, that includes a deep, loving relationship \nwith one another because at the end of the day, THAT IS \nTHE STORY THAT #OUAT IS TELLING US and has \nbeen since the pilot episode.”  (Emphasis mine). \n \nFor the original poster, any outcome of the show that does not result in an “endgame” for \nSwan Queen will “have made a joke out of same-sex headed families.” Moreover, this fan lists \nnumerous real-world issues that queer and LGBT+ individuals experience on a daily basis while \narguing that OUAT  has to make Swan Queen endgame and explaining that there can be no other \nalternative, “…not when same-sex couples are fighting so hard for their rights, not when women \nare still paid less than men….” This is, potentially, a heavy indictment of the show runners and \ntheir broad disregard for these systemic issues in favor of re-creating and re-telling heterosexist \nnarratives of family, “True Love,” and “Happily Ever After.” In fact, when reblogging the post, \nwittyoncer hashtags, “#this is some fucking amazing meta8” as appreciation for the time and \neffort that this fan took to dissect their thoughts and critique the show runners’ overall missteps \nin dealing with the potential for queer romance between Emma and Regina.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n8 Drawing from Jenkins’ concept (1992; 2013), meta can best be described as meta-textual analysis performed by \nfans in which they draw on their own knowledge and beliefs in an effort to expand on situations presented in the \nshow (plot, character representation, etc.).  \n\t\t 33\t\nAdditionally, the original poster boldly and proudly proclaims that Swan Queen is a \n“movement.” By saying that the act of shipping Swan Queen is a movement, this fan \nreestablishes the social implications of queer families, representation, and media advocacy that \nintertwine quite commonly in their lived experiences while also relaying that Swan Queen is a \ncollective identity (Hunt and Benford, 2004). Jenkins (1992; 2013) rightly states that fans \nincorporate their own lived experiences into their fandom participation and I believe that there is \nan open exchange and interplay between the two that facilitates the expansion from fandom \nactivity solely towards fan activity and fan activism. Recognizing their queer fandom \nengagement as a social movement provides this fan an outlet to discuss queerphobia and the \ntargeted aggressions one experiences in a heterocentric society and the ways in which these \naggressions are transferred into fandom itself. Perhaps there is no distinction between their \nfandom activity and their fan activism. This particular rumination will be addressed further as I \ndelve in to an analysis of gaslighting and antagonism in an effort to shore up the specific \ninterventions of queer fandoms such as the Swan Queen community in an answer to my second \nresearch question. \nOverall, the original poster’s main message remains one of hope for seeing Swan Queen \nbecome canon in the show some day because they believe that Emma, Regina, and Henry living \n“Happily Ever After” is the story the show has been telling since the very beginning. However, I \nbelieve that this perspective does run the risk of producing a homonormative framework, as \nmany Swan Queen fans that support the idea of Emma and Regina’s relationship becoming \ncanon do so based on heterosexist and heteronormative notions of what constitutes a family. I \nstrongly believe that this factor should be studied in greater detail at a later date. \n  \n\t\t 34\t\n(3) The Deconstruction and Reconstruction of the “True Love” Narrative \nAbove, I have discussed how the Swan Queen fandom formed and continues to develop \nout of its members’ opposition to the show runners’ focus on hegemonic (e.g. heterocentric) \nrepresentations of “True Love” and “Happily Ever After.” Thus, Swan Queen fans engage in \ntheir fandom by developing and sharing their own counter narratives of “True Love.” I maintain \nthat the Swan Queen fans on Tumblr engage in their fandom by actively addressing and \nattempting intervention through critiques of the show (and its creators, actors, plotlines, etc.), by \nquestioning and discussing plot and character development via meta textual analysis, and by \ncreating their own fan art and fan fiction to share with others in the queer fandom. I will now \naddress each action more closely. \n Clearly, fans often vent their frustrations and disappointment at the show (as seen in \nmany of the text posts). However, this sometimes does not help to quell their questions or move \nbeyond feeling as if their favorite show has, in some way, betrayed them. Jenkins (1992) \naddresses this very concept in a chapter from Textual Poachers entitled “It’s Not a Fairytale \nAnymore.” In this case, fans of the American fantasy/drama Beauty and the Beast (1987-1990) \nfound themselves at odds with the producers’ narratives for the show and took matters in to their \nown hands, so to speak, by creating their own interpretations of the stories and character \ndevelopment that diverge from those of the show. As such, the Swan Queen fan community is \njust one of many fandoms that actively engages in the fan-creation of texts, images, and videos. \nFan art and fan videos are extremely important elements to the Swan Queen fandom but for the \nsake of this project I narrow my focus to the production of fan fiction by members of the queer \nfandom who seek to reject the show’s narratives and write their own. The text post that follows \ndemonstrates how wittyoncer addresses their community—expressing a shared sense of \ncollective anger in response to an episode that had recently aired, \n\t\t 35\t\n“man i haven’t even seen this thing yet and i am \ngrossed out/mad by proxy just from perusing \ntumblr. \nSO: i’m gonna do what i can to have chapter 10 first \nthing tuesday morning because i know i’m gonna \nneed to spend time with SwanQueen to cleanse my \nbrain, as we all must, so i’ll offer that up as my \ncontribution. \nthink of it as a hug for the feels…” \n \nWittyoncer seems to address the entire fandom and the feelings that many in the community \nwere expressing on Tumblr at the time. Here, they are commiserating with their fellow fans \nabout the episode as a whole rather than a particular scene, which leads me to believe that the \nepisode featured heavy amounts of Outlaw Queen and/or Captain Swan scenes. As such, \nwittyoncer offers an updated chapter of one of their fan fiction series to their followers on \nTumblr as a “contribution” to the queer fandom in an effort to help them “cleanse” their brains of \nthe upsetting elements from the show. Moreover, wittyoncer offers the fan fiction chapter as “a \nhug for the feels,” indicating that their text may be able to help their fellow Swan Queen fans \nfeel better, emotionally.   \nThus far, I have shown how the Swan Queen fandom developed on Tumblr and the ways \nin which queer fans have rejected Once Upon a Time’s heterocentric narratives in favor of \nwriting their own. I now shift my attention towards a discussion of how Swan Queen fans talk \nabout the purpose and importance of their counter narratives, both for themselves and for the \nSwan Queen community as a whole, as I answer my second research question.  \nResearch Question 2: A Queer Fandom’s Importance and Their Goals for Intervention \nBased on my analysis, Swan Queen fans maintain that the importance and purpose of \ntheir counter narratives is to engage with the fandom community because they (1) feel that the \nshow is queerbaiting them and are attempting to counteract negative effects of queerbaiting, (2) \nuse their narratives to critique the show’s heterosexist storylines as empty and dangerous, and (3) \n\t\t 36\t\nrespond to gaslighting by the show runners and (4) other fans. I will focus on each of these \npoints in more detail below.  \n(1) Queerbaiting and its Implications for Queer Fans \nThus far in this section, I have endeavored to elucidate further the notion that Swan \nQueen fans bond over their shared experiences when watching the show and their similar queer \nreadings of Emma and Regina and that they eventually came to the conclusion that OUAT does \nnot provide an inclusive or “new” fairytale at all. Rather, I argue, these fans believe that the show \nis queerbaiting them in an effort to draw larger audiences. In what follows, Swan Queen fans \ndiscuss why they feel this way and argue further against the queerbaiting they see taking place by \ncountering with their own specific arguments supporting a romantic relationship between Emma \nand Regina. \n Below, a Swan Queen fan posts a short text post constituting entirely of hashtags that \nreads, “#subtext #what subtext #it’s text ffs.” \n The fan created a text post containing hashtags rather than regular text, conveying a \nunique semiotic message about subtext within the show—ostensibly in regards to Regina and \nEmma’s interactions, even though there is no mention of either character. In contrast to other \nfans in the Swan Queen community that focus on subtext, the poster argues that the characters’ \ninteractions are “main” text (i.e. intentional). The content, as well as the tone, of the post \nillustrates this fan’s impatience at having to explain why they do not perceive Emma and \nRegina’s interactions as being subtext because of the use of “ffs” at the end, commonly \ntranslated as “for fuck’s sake9.” I believe that the fan uses this post as a response to the larger \nissue at hand between several disparate groups of fans of the show on Tumblr: whether or not \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n9 This common abbreviation is used in texting and online messaging and conveys a sense of aggravation or \nannoyance. \n\t\t 37\t\nSwan Queen fans have the right to publicly call out the show runners and the queerbaiting taking \nplace. In other words, many Swan Queen fans feel compelled to defend their decisions to call out \nqueerbaiting in the show and to do this, they must simultaneously 1) provide evidence to \nnaysayers that there is, indeed, subtextual elements of attraction (or ”maintext,” in this fan’s \ncase) between the two women and 2) that the show runners are portraying it purposefully with no \nintentions of developing the relationship further. Wittyoncer adds their own commentary about \nthe production team of the show and the intentionality of their actions: \n“you cannot fucking tell me they didn’t know what they were \ndoing when they wrote and acted and directed and edited these \nlines. no one on the planet in 2011, let alone working in genre TV, \nwas that unaware of the existence of same-sex desire, slashing, etc. \nwhat was “unintentional” was that fans latched onto it and wanted \nthe level of things that they had already put in the text to continue \nand develop along the trajectory that they laid out, where they just \nwanted to hint and run and captivate our attention and for us to sit \ndown and shut up and take what they gave us. \nbecause make no mistake, when they say “fan,” they mean \nsomeone who sits down and shuts up and takes whatever they give \nthem.” \n \nWittyoncer reveals here that they are displeased with the show runners for framing the \ninstances between Emma and Regina that queer fans find to be evidence of queering the \ncharacters as “unintentional” (as discussed in more depth in the first half of this section). \nFurthermore, by highlighting that it was 2011 and that “no one on the planet” could claim to be \nunaware of slashing and same-sex desire, wittyoncer confronts what they see to be the problem: \nshow runners knew what they were doing when producing particular scenes between Emma and \nRegina that could be read queerly but expected fans to “sit down and take whatever” they \ndecided to produce. Wittyoncer’s use of swearing in the beginning instills within their argument \na sense of anger towards anyone refusing to believe that a mainstream television show could (or \nwould) employ tactics of queerbaiting (discussed more in-depth in Previous Literature section). \n\t\t 38\t\n(2) “Dangerous” heterosexist storylines \nBelow, wittyoncer discusses what they perceive to be their right to call out and critique \nthe show runners for their continuous portrayal of Captain Hook as a dastardly pirate who will \nnot stop until he gets his way. In this case, getting his way means aggressively pursuing Emma \neven after she has made it clear she was not interested in returning his affection. Wittyoncer \nspeaks of the social implications of such dangerous portrayals,  \n“we who are concerned about the social implications of \n“rewarding” Hook for not listening the myriad times Emma \nindicated disinterest aren’t inherently hateful. we’re making a \ncritique. we’re pointing out a social system. and we have a right to \ncall Adam and Eddy out when they imply that not taking “no” for \nan answer is anything other than fundamentally unacceptable.”  \n \nWittyoncer begins their post by disagreeing with the accusation harnessed against Swan \nQueen fans that they are “inherently hateful” for their critiques against the show runners. Rather, \nwittyoncer clarifies that Swan Queen fans have collectively agreed that the storylines being told \nin the show about Hook’s aggressive pursuit of Emma Swan are dangerous. The danger lies in \nthe perpetuation of rape culture and the systemic violence that women face every day from men \nwho do not believe that “no means no.” In critiquing the way that the show runners have \nportrayed Hook solely as a persistent suitor, wittyoncer wants to make clear that “rewarding” \nhim by having Emma suddenly change her mind in the show has real and damaging social \nimplications in the world. By this, they mean that the show remains complicit in promoting rape \nculture and its harmful affects on women and girls who have grown up believing that they have \nno say in the matter of romance and sexual agency.  \nFans not only actively address and critique the show and its production team, they also \nquestion and discuss plot and character development. The following text post by wittyoncer \n\t\t 39\t\nillustrates the way in which they feel the plotline regarding Regina and Robin Hood’s seemingly \nrushed courtship is not sensible and how this goes against who Regina is as a character, \n“What I am fundamentally not okay with, and not just as, again, a \nconfessed SQ advocate, is losing who Regina is to make this \nhappen. She has, due to life experience, become perennially \nsuspicious, and she’s emotionally destroyed right now. She \nabsolutely cannot immediately form some sort of deep bond with a \nstranger, fate or no fate. Can’t. \nI’d cope with them moving toward it if it was organic and I could \nbelieve that Regina would be happy, because I’m Regina first even \nover SQ (though I think SQ is her best shot). But right now I don’t \nsee how we get to Regina/happy on this route.”  \n \n It becomes clear when reading the post that wittyoncer disagrees very strongly with the \nRegina/Robin storyline in regards to Regina’s character development. Additionally, they clarify \nthat being a “confessed SQ advocate” has very little to do with their discontent with the show. \nRather, wittyoncer is concerned with this plotline because they feel that it leads to “losing who \nRegina is” in order for the show runners to accomplish their goal of making Outlaw Queen \ncanon. This concept of “losing” what makes a character who they are is commonly called \n“character assassination” by fandom members10 as fans have strong and, oftentimes, rigid or \nfixed ideas of what their favorite characters should be like in terms of mannerisms, behavior, \nbackstory/continuity, and emotionality. Indeed, these factors often are imbricated alongside a \nfan’s own “headcanon,” or, how they perceive the character to think, feel, and react to their \nfictional environment based on the fan’s own ontological perspective (i.e. their own lived \nexperiences). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n10 Jenkins (1992) refers to the concept of “character assassination” as “character rape” in Textual Poachers. While \nhe accurately used the term most accepted by fan communities during the 1980s and early 90s, this is not the case \ntoday. Clearly the use of the term “rape,” even when used abstractly by fandom members to address symbolic \ndamages to their favorite shows’ characters, is problematic and triggering for many. The shift to the term “character \nassassination” lessens the stigma and makes it more acceptable and approachable. \n\t\t 40\t\nWittyoncer goes on to explain why Regina would never embark in a relationship with a \nstranger during a period in time where she is “emotionally destroyed.” This assertion illustrates \nhow they actively question the believability of Regina’s actions in the show, positing that Regina \nhas experienced too much in her life to fall in love with Robin—regardless of the show runners’ \ndeveloping narrative focusing on Robin Hood and Regina being soul mates who are bound by \nTinker Bell’s “pixie dust” and fate to meet and fall in love. Many in the Swan Queen fandom, \nincluding wittyoncer, see this as a ploy or contrivance by the show’s producers to move the plot \nforward and garner fuller audience support for “Outlaw Queen.”  \nFurther Navigating Contentious Relationships: “The Powers That Be” and “Anti-SQ” \nBased on my analysis so far, it is most evident that Swan Queen fans feel that Once Upon \na Time’s creative team rejects Swan Queen (or even the potential for it in the show) in favor of \nwriting heterosexist storylines and relationships for Emma and Regina. Below, a text post thread \ndemonstrates a fairly typical “group” discussion between Swan Queen fans about the show’s \n“soulmate” story arc in seasons 3 and 4. The original text in this post is structured in the form of \nan “Anonymous Ask” submitted to a fan that answers it publically on their blog. This thread has \nbeen reblogged by wittyoncer wherein they add their own thoughts. The anonymous fan asks, \n“Hood is not as a big threat to Swan Queen as Hook. The whole \nsoulmate thing came pretty much out of the blue because A&E \nthought it'll make us happy to see Regina fall in love with a \nrandom dude. Hook on other hand is their favorite manchild and \none of the main reasons they wanted the rights of Peter Pan since \nthe first episode. Of all characters they sent him to New York to \nfind Emma. 'Find' - the one word that the show main canon couple \nequalize with happy ending. That's when my last hope sunk” \n \nIn response to the message above, the original poster writes, \n \n“Pretty much agree with you on that, anon. But still, Emma looks \nreally NOT interested in Hook so for now I’m okay, but we got \n\t\t 41\t\nspoiled about what happen between Hood and Regina and THAT \nhurts like hell…” \n \nwittyoncer reblogs the entire thread above and adds, \n“seconded. in terms of attachment Robin is the threat because \nRegina’s interested in a way Emma is canonically a million percent \nnot (+ outcome spoilers), but there’s a strong chance of tragedy. \nbut then yes, the “favorite manchild” factor and the “find” factor \nand the “we need a sexy guy on the show because ladies think with \ntheir vaginas in deciding what to watch and are all straight” factor \nand the official pro CS position are all troubling. heteronormativity \nwith a side of dubcon, i guess.” \n \nHere, the anonymous Swan Queen fan asking the “question” makes clear that they believe that \nthe show runners (aka “The Powers That Be” or TPTB) are under the impression that the show’s \naudience is 1) monolithic and uniform, and 2) that this “passive audience” (Jenkins, 2012) wants \nto see Regina and Emma with “dudes,” only, thus perpetuating traditional fairytales and the use \nof heterocentric romance tropes. In response to this “Ask” on their blog, the original poster \nagrees with the anonymous fan, reiterating that they also see TPTB’s actions as favoring the \nstraight ship over the queer potentiality of the Swan Queen ship.  \nWittyoncer adds their own thoughts about TPTB to the thread, saying that Horowitz and \nKitsis are operating on the assumption that half of the entire audience for the show is completely \nin favor of seeing Emma and Regina fall in love with male characters “because ladies think with \ntheir vaginas” and “are all straight.” Summarizing the key points made in the original post \nbetween the anon fan with their “ask” and the Swan Queen fan who answered it, wittyoncer \ndrolly offers their perception of TPTB’s actions by calling it out for being “heteronormativity \nwith a side of dubcon.” This is a strong critique masked as sarcasm, as wittyoncer is accusing the \nshow runners of promoting and perpetuating heterocentric relationships (in of itself not an \nentirely problematic issue) while also introducing the troubling concept of dubcon. “Dubcon” is \nfan jargon for “dubious consent,” implying that there has not been an explicit discussion or \n\t\t 42\t\nacceptance from an individual before they engage in sexual activity with another. Thus, \nwittyoncer’s response identifies and names a dangerous element that they feel is being threaded \nin to the Captain Swan story arc that further emphasizes a reliance on rape culture. Moreover, I \nsuggest that the call outs and criticism of the show and TPTB such as those shown above lead the \nshow runners to gaslight the queer fans which then encourages antagonistic, heterosexist fans of \nOnce Upon a Time who oppose Swan Queen (“anti-SQ fans”) to threaten and attack Swan Queen \nfans online by telling them that they made it all up or they are sick/crazy/wrong to ship Swan \nQueen as a couple.  \n(3) Gaslighting  \nWe move on from analyzing text posts recounting the ways in which Swan Queen fans \nexpress their critiques and disappointment with the show to text posts expressing the common-\nheld belief that the show runners are gaslighting them in order to make them doubt themselves, \ntheir grievances against the show, as well as the validity of their counter narratives. The \nfollowing “Ask” addresses Hook potentially gaslighting Emma in the show but, more \nimportantly, the fan who answers the question in their blog states that the actions in the show \n(above) are linked to TPBT’s efforts to gaslight queer fans in an attempt to make Captain Hook \nlook innocent after portraying him as a misogynistic villain throughout much of the early \nseasons. The question posed reads, \n“One of the many, many things that have been bothering about \nHook is his lies to Emma; ones she should immediately know are \nuntrue – seeing her power when Cora tried to take her heart (he \nwas unconscious), about how she defeated Pan (Gold), and Zelena \n(Regina). Would you say that Hook is ‘gaslighting’ Emma in a \n‘minor’ way?” \n \nThe Swan Queen fan who received this question responds with, \n \n  “well, psychology is not my strong suit, but i’ll do my best. \ndefinition of gaslighting:  \n\t\t 43\t\na form of mental abuse in which false information is presented \nwith the intent of making victims doubt their \nown memory, perception, and sanity. Instances may range simply \nfrom the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever \noccurred, up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the \nintention of disorienting the victim. \nand honestly, what i really would say is that this these lies are not \na glaring failure in continuity but actually part of TPTB \ngaslighting us. Hook is retconning Emma because flattery will get \nyou everywhere, but it’s also a way to retcon Hook into a good \nguy. \nit will be easier for them to ram this through if we doubt our own \nmemories of his rape jokes and creepy insistence on his crush on \nEmma in the face of her disinterest and the transacting of her \nbetween Hook and Neal and all that shit they did. so they are \nsuddenly (though wildly inconsistently) making him act like \nsupportive boyfriend, facts be damned, so that he can become \nactual boyfriend. \n…and this is why the fact that all the nastiness they ever wrote for \nHook is documented in full, living, moving color on Tumblr is so \nvital. we will not forget. we will not forgive.” (Emphasis mine) \n \n \n In answering the question posed to them, this fan makes an effort to define the term as they \nunderstand it. They then introduce their belief that TPTB are the ones who are guilty of \ngaslighting the Swan Queen fandom, transferring the action from the realm of fiction and \ninteractions between the characters to the real and lived world of viewers, fans, and producers \nwho share a complicated and contentious relationship. By asserting their belief that it is TPTB \nwho gaslight the fans of the show (particularly the queer fans), this individual implicates that the \nproducers are the villains in this narrative and that their re-branding of Captain Hook as the \n“good guy” is simply a method used to ensure that the show’s fans accept his worth as Emma’s \nboyfriend and potential “True Love” without ever having to address the rape jokes and his \n“creepy” behavior around Emma that were consistent in his portrayal in earlier seasons.  \n The last portion of the fan’s response demonstrates their unwillingness to be gaslit by the \nproducers as well as their refusal to accept Hook’s sudden change in characterization. They \n\t\t 44\t\nproclaim that the Swan Queen fandom’s efforts in documenting “all the nastiness they ever wrote \nfor Hook” on Tumblr is vital, ending with “we will not forget. we will not forgive.” Invoking the \nentire Swan Queen fandom in this statement creates a collective action borne out of anger and \ndistrust at the producers for their actions and mistreatment of the queer fan community. What is \nmore, this last sentence emphatically demonstrates that this fan holds a grievance against the \nproducers and that they continue to participate in the online fandom in an effort to document the \nways in which they, themselves (as well as others in their community), are gaslit and made to \nfeel crazy or wrong for both their rejection of the canon romances and their insistence in \nshipping Swan Queen.  \n In reblogging this thread of text, wittyoncer implies that it is pertinent to consider the \noriginal poster’s stance on the subject of gaslighting. Furthermore, they include three hashtags in \ntheir reblog (#ouat meta, # anti-captain hook, and #anti-captain swan), instilling a very clear \nmessage that they are in support of their fellow fans communicating their grievances with the \nshow and its producers. These hashtags illustrate a personal as well as a collective stance against \nthe show’s narratives and can (perhaps should?) be read as further fractioning away from the \nlarger and more general/hegemonic fandom for the show that antagonizes Swan Queen fans on \nTumblr through Anonymous Asks submissions that aim to target and attack Swan Queen fans \ndirectly. These actions, taken alongside the gaslighting from the producers, further aim to \nmarginalize and Other members of the queer fandom. \n \n(4) Experiences of Queerphobic Antagonism and Violence  \nFollowing such a powerful fan response to the gaslighting of queer fans by the show \nrunners, it is imperative to continue in a similar vein in order to illustrate the acts of violence \ntaken upon Swan Queen fans by those within the show’s general fandom who antagonize and \n\t\t 45\t\nthreaten queer fandom members based on their own queerphobic and anti-LGBT+ beliefs. These \nattacks come in many forms but most commonly rely on textual threats and hate speech via \nAnonymous Ask submissions. The interaction below demonstrates a violent attack on Swan \nQueen fans (as a group) by an individual posting an anonymous “Ask” to a Swan Queen fandom \naccount on Tumblr. The Swan Queen fandom account is public and run by administrators who \ndecide what content to publish on the blog. In other words, it is not an individual fan’s blog but \nrather a space in which large numbers of Swan Queen fans submit their “confessions” about the \nshow, the characters, their perspectives and thoughts about Swan Queen, and so on. \nThe message from Anonymous reads: \n“For fuck sake how many fucking homo characters do you need? \nYou bullied Adam and Eddy into giving you Mulan now stop \ntrying to ruin the rest of the fucking show. Once will not be ruined \nby perverts and fucking filth like you. I will not let my children \nwatch that sort of TV. Neither Emma or Regina are gay so stop \npushing your agenda onto other people! Just fuck off and leave it \nbe. Hope you just curl up and die fucking freak!” \t\nUpon reading the “Ask,” one detects the anger and revulsion within the Anonymous \nposter’s words (referring to queer characters, collectively, as “fucking homo characters”). They \nthen complain that Swan Queen fans bullied the creators of the show into making Mulan \ncanonically, though not transparently, queer in the show’s 5th season. This culminates in their \ncommand for the queer fandom to “stop trying to ruin the rest of the fucking show.” Implicated \nthroughout the message is their personal and political stance on LGBTQ+ rights. Take for \nexample their next sentence in which they refer to Swan Queen fans (both individually and \ncollectively) as “perverts” and “fucking filth.” Harsh and hateful, these words are aimed to hurt \ntheir reader. The Anonymous Tumblr user continues their attack by saying that they will not let \ntheir children watch “that kind of TV,” referring specifically to any media content that includes \n\t\t 46\t\nqueer content. Moreover, this individual refers to Swan Queen fans’ collective activism (i.e. \npushing for Swan Queen to become canon) as an “agenda”—this, of course, refers to the so-\ncalled “Gay Agenda” that has been used in anti-LGBTQ+ discourse since the latter end of the \n20th century and continues to drive right wing and religious protests today.  \nThe last two sentences, in particular, warrant scrutiny. “Anonymous” might have ended \nwith their penultimate sentence (“Just fuck off and let it be”), yet they made the decision to add, \n“Hope you just curl up and die fucking freak!” The former, while aggressive in its own right, still \nconveys some minute sense of civility in telling the Administrator of the Swan Queen blog to \n“let it be.” In other words, they are telling Swan Queen fans to stop shipping Regina and Emma \naltogether, demonstrating the poster’s wish for the symbolic annihilation of the Swan Queen \ncommunity in an effort to further silence fans’ efforts to address their grievances.    However, by \nadding the last sentence, the Anonymous poster has committed an act of hate speech in a willful \nattempt to harass and harm the individual in charge of the blog and, by extension, the rest of the \nqueer fandom community. This is a direct attack on queer fans’ existences based entirely on the \nAnonymous poster’s personal hatred. Additionally, this hatred has been transferred directly into \na particular Tumblr space (the Swan Queen blog) where queer fans had, in the past, felt relatively \nsecure participating in their fandom activities. Thus, this queer public space has been breached.  \nRegardless of its virtual components, this queer online space and its community members \nnow experience the same violence, aggressions (both micro and macro) and threats that queer \nand LGBT+ individuals face in their daily lives. Next, I will examine the blog administrator’s \nresponse to the message. Additionally, I look at another member of the Swan Queen fandom’s \nresponse to the hateful message wherein they try to bolster the administrator’s spirits. These \n\t\t 47\t\nresponses are, in my mind, far more important to consider than the Anonymous message by itself \nbecause they matter both for the fans individually and collectively.  \nThe Swan Queen blog’s administrator reblogs the message, adding, “I will not even get \ndown on your level but people have messaged me asking to see this message.” This response \naddresses the Anonymous poster’s attack on them, as an individual, and how the administrator of \nthe blog refuses to respond in kind to the message. Moreover, they clarify that the purpose for \nreblogging the Anonymous message is because other Swan Queen fans have requested its \npublication for the blog’s followers to read. By making it visible, the blog’s administrator hopes \nto address the violence in acts and to facilitate an open conversation about being targeted by anti-\nSwan Queen fans who express their queer and homophobic beliefs through acts of hate speech. I \nbelieve that it can be implied that other members in the queer fandom for Once Upon a Time \nhave, at some point in time, experienced similar attacks for shipping Swan Queen. This leads me \nto an insightful response from a Swan Queen fan who reblogged the thread and responds, \n  “This is WHY Swan Queen has to happen. \nLook, two years ago, even the SQ shippers that I knew anyhow, \ncould have gotten on board with a LI introduced for Regina and \nanother for Emma, that wouldn’t have amounted to SQ=endgame \nbut would have given some kind of organic, open-ended, \npotentially interesting storyline. Two years ago we weren’t \ndemanding endgame.  \nWhat changed? \nThis level and amount of bullying was one major change. The more \nhet on the show, the more the bullying against Swan Queen \nshippers increased. The trolling increased and the attacks \nincreased. We’re now dealing with backlash. And this backlash is \nfed by the heterosexism that both demands and nourishes the \ncontrived ‘ships’ known as OQ and CS.  \nAnother major change: this audience has started demanding more \nthan just subtext. we the audience generally stopped wanting to \nsettle for less. There may be dissidents in that argument, people \nwho still insist that subtext is good enough and the rest of us \nshould shut our damn pie holes (LOL) but there are too many of us \nnow refusing to just accept anything but SQ=canon/endgame…Ok, \n\t\t 48\t\nanyhow, yeah, the writing and the PR and the fandom have created \na toxic problem of hatred and homophobia. But…The good news? \nPeople are having ongoing, intelligent discussion about \nheterosexism and its meanings and implications. This kind of \nbullying, this kind of toxic hateful shit that swan-queenconfessions \nhas had to shoulder above? This crap is becoming blatant to the \npoint that very few (only a troll or two) can deny that it’s \nhappening any longer.  \nSwan Queen has to now be endgame. The writers have created a \ncontext where refusing to pull Emma/Regina closer together will \nmake ABC look bad, it’ll make them look bad, and all for no good \nreason.” \n \nThe fan reblogging the thread from the blog’s administrator begins their commentary by \nproclaiming that “This is WHY Swan Queen has to happen.” We can only assume that “this” \nrefers to the Anonymous poster’s malicious words and their affective power to harm. Continuing \ntheir commentary, the fan establishes that two years prior to that particular point in time (4th \nseason) most Swan Queen fans were not as passionately engaged in their fan activism, but they \nare now “demanding” to see Emma and Regina become endgame on the show. The fan believes \nthat this stance shifted in large part due to two major changes within fandom for the show: 1) \nThe increased promotion of the canon/heterosexist ships in the show that further spurred anti-\nSwan Queen fans on in their bullying of queer fandom members (“The trolling and the attacks \nincreased.”) and 2) the audience, particularly queer members of the audience, began demanding \nmore than the subtext they saw between the two women in a direct response to feeling queer \nbaited by the producers (“we the audience generally stopped wanting to settle for less”). Further \ndown in the fan’s commentary they state, “the writing and the PR and the fandom have created a \ntoxic problem of hatred and homophobia.” This fan understands that these three key elements of \nthe show have led to the increased negativity and homophobic aggressions from non/anti-Swan \nQueen fans against individuals within the queer fandom. They call this a toxic problem, in fact. \nBy naming the problem toxic, they are saying that it could, perhaps, produce real harm to \n\t\t 49\t\nmembers of the Swan Queen fandom. They shift away from identifying the problem to \naddressing the “good news” that stems from it: fan activism and a growing number of \ndiscussions centered around heterosexism and what it means.  \nThey continue, arguing that the “toxic hateful shit” that the fan blog has endured is \nbecoming commonplace enough that it is becoming “blatant” in its visibility. This visibility, the \nfan argues, means that Swan Queen has to become canon because “the writers have created a \ncontext where refusing to pull Emma/Regina closer together will make ABC look bad.” Thus, \nrefusing to make Swan Queen “endgame” becomes an issue of reputation for ABC and the \nproducers. Moreover, the fan believes that ABC and its employees have no choice but to, bluntly \nspeaking, take the queer fandom’s side in the escalating “fandom war” focused on the characters’ \nsexuality and homophobia. In sum, this fan’s perceptions of the mounting aggressions against \nqueer fandom members on Tumblr as well as their growing certainty in the network’s potential \nsupport for the Swan Queen fandom leave them hopeful that there can be progress made in \ndecentering the show’s heterosexist narratives.  \nWittyoncer reblogs from the Swan Queen fan above and adds, “this is some goddamn \noutstanding meta.” Again, reblogging the entire thread implies that they appreciate the discussion \nthat has taken place. Their additional comment about the thread—specifically the Swan Queen \nfan’s contribution above—being “goddamn outstanding meta” shows how much they value the \nthoughts and perspectives of other members of the Swan Queen fandom and how useful meta \ndiscussions are when situations such as this one, wherein the real world and its negativities \nbreach supposedly safe spaces for fans to actively participate in their fandom. \n  \n\t\t 50\t\n \n \n \n \n \nV.\tDISCUSSION \n\t\nIt has been my goal to illustrate what happens when a particular group of queer fans no \nlonger believe that what they think and feel matter to the producers as well as other fans of their \nfavorite television show. Indeed, members of the Swan Queen fandom continue to fight against \nthe foreclosure of their very own “Happily Ever After” even as they come to terms with the \nnotion that they have become disenchanted. Disagreeing with the show and rejecting its running \ndiscursive narrative, we see evidence of them choosing to, instead, create and maintain their own \ncounter narratives featuring Emma and Regina online where they can be shared, discussed, and \ncelebrated by others within the queer fandom.  \nBy rejecting the show’s narratives of “True Love” and creating their own counter \nnarratives, resisting its producers’ efforts to gaslight them into doubting themselves and their \ngrievances, and addressing the aggressive and oftentimes verbally violent attacks on individual \nmembers of the Swan Queen fandom on Tumblr, this fandom pushes back against the \ninstitutionalized nature of media fandom where heterosexism drives plot and character \ndevelopment and rewards, as wittyoncer argues, “fans that just sit back and take it.” Indeed, \nqueer fandoms such as the Swan Queen fandom provide ample evidence that, contrary to what \nthe producers of OUAT think, there is no such thing as a passive fandom. They will not forget \nand they will not forgive. \nFandom as an institution \t\nAs the “dust” has settled and my thoughts and considerations have fallen into place, it \nremains clear to me that fandom is not a monolithic entity in the slightest. Nor is fandom a \n\t\t 51\t\ncompletely unifying and well-oiled process as Bacon-Smith asserted in Enterprising Women \n(1992). The same year, Jenkins published the first edition of Textual Poachers (1992) in which \nhe set out to illustrate that fandom is an active participatory culture where one chooses to claim \nan identity as a fan, disagreeing with the ease in which fandom so quickly became the punchline \nto a joke about not having a life (9-10). In Textual Poachers, he achieves his goals of shifting our \nperceptions of fandom by using the words of fans themselves to explain why they call \nthemselves such. I kept his research efforts and his quasi-autoethnographic method of collecting \nfans’ narratives in mind throughout my analysis of text posts that were carefully and thoughtfully \ncrafted by Swan Queen fans on Tumblr. Overwhelmingly, Swan Queen fans demonstrate in their \nposts a concept that Jenkins discusses in regards to fandom culture during a conversation with \nSuzanne Scott, “[F]ans have had to resist pressures that would shut down their readings of \ntexts—pressures towards heteronormativity in their own everyday lives and in the public \nresponse to their interpretive and creative practices” (Jenkins, Textual Poachers 2012, xxxii). \nHowever, the fandom Jenkins describes in the quote above is not the cohesive queer fandom that \nI know and recognize as the Swan Queen fandom. \nBasing his interest in exploring fandom culture on his own identity as a fan, he primarily \nfocuses his analysis and discussion of fandom on heterosexual individuals—heterosexual women \nin particular. As such, I believe that Jenkins’ assessment of fandom and fans remains generalized \nand hetero-centric. Without actually addressing it as such, he briefly mentions but does not offer \nany theories about queer fandom during the above-mentioned conversation with Scott, saying, \n“critical theory needs to be attentive to whose fantasies are being excluded, what mechanisms are \nexcluding them, and which groups have the power to include or exclude from the cultural \nmainstream” (xxxi). I am in agreement with Jenkins on this matter and have endeavored to do \n\t\t 52\t\njust this by focusing on contentions between queer and non-queer fans of Once Upon a Time. \nThe development and maintenance of such a queer fandom require further attention from \nacademe, which is why I propose a return to queer theoretical work to better address both. \nBelow, I elucidate on a few ways that queer theory attends to the study of queer fandom \ncommunities and further facilitates discussion of the particular intersection between Fandom as \nan institution (hence my use of the capital “F”) and queerness. \nQueer Theory and Queer Fandom \t\nSedgwick’s Epistemology of the Closet (1993) may be of use in the effort to shore up \nlinkages between queer self-identity and queer fandom membership. The text’s introduction, \n“Axiomatic,” lists axioms that emphasize difference among individuals, maintaining that each \n“can differentiate even people of identical gender, race, nationality, class, and 'sexual orientation' \n– each one of which, however, if taken seriously as pure difference, retains the unaccounted-for \npotential to disrupt many forms of the available thinking about sexuality\" (1993, 24-25). The \nfirst axiom simply reads, “people are different from each other” (22). Far too often, we reduce \nthe contributions of difference, particularly the productivity that follows, in an effort to preserve \na status quo. Similarly, we reduce the contributions of queer fans to media fandom in order to \nmaintain hegemonic standards held up by the institution of popular culture.  \nUsing this axiom enables us to further question the differences between hegemonic \nfandom and counterhegemonic fandom or, more plainly, heterocentric fandom and queer \nfandom. Jenkins (1992) similarly discusses this notion, pointing out that we often operate under \nthe impression that there is a “right way” and a “wrong way” to be a fan. Queer fandom cannot \nexist within a vacuum, out of sight and stored away for the comfort of heterocentric fans who \nconsider queer shipping wrong. In the case of the queer fandom dedicated to the Swan Queen \n\t\t 53\t\nship, popular culture’s continued reliance on outdated tropes of romance and fairytale “True \nLove” such as OUAT’s exclude and marginalize those that seek representations of a queer \n“Happily Ever After”. Indeed, it is clear that queer fandom members must continuously work on \ntheir complex relationship with the increasingly more hegemonic Fandom and resist its \nmembers’ assimilationist habits that lead to perpetuating compulsory heterosexuality.   \nBennett’s (2010) close analysis of the 1998 film Velvet Goldmine and his considerations \nsurrounding fandom, affect, and reading practices offer up much in the way of queer \ntheorization. Indeed, he supposes that there is “something queer about fandom in general” based \non his understanding of both Sedgwick’s and Jenkins’ works on affect and shame (Bennett 2010, \n18-19). This is quite an impactful statement to make in regards to an ever-growing cultural \npractice—indeed, one that I believe has become institutionalized—and is one that requires us to \ntake a moment to reconsider our own relational proximity to the often contradicting emotions we \nexperience when actively participating in fandom. If Bennett is correct and there is something \nqueer about fandom in general, how did we arrive upon the precipice of a widening chasm \nbetween heterocentric/”right” ways of being a fan and queer/”wrong” ways? Clearly, the anti-\nSwan Queen fans of Once Upon a Time who anonymously attack Swan Queen fans on Tumblr \ndo not agree with Bennett, insisting instead that a fandom developed and maintained out of \nsupport for a non-canonical queer ship such as that between Regina and Emma is wrong and/or \nsick and should be silenced completely. In the Anonymous Ask submitted to the administrator of \nthe Swan Queen “confessions” blog, the anti-Swan Queen fan attempted to demoralize and \nshame the queer fandom for shipping two women together. Furthermore, “Anonymous” attacked \nboth the administrator and the entire Swan Queen fandom by telling them that they “hope [they] \ncurl up and die.” There are, then, scary and oftentimes threatening instances in which queer \n\t\t 54\t\nfandom members such as those within the Swan Queen fandom encounter the same hatred and \nqueerphobia on Tumblr that they do “offline” in the world around them. Regardless of place and \nspace, queer fans that embrace their fandom and participate outside of the hegemonic standards \nof the quotidian are forcefully told that their fannish contributions are neither appreciated nor \nwelcome in the larger, more general Fandom. The reactions and responses from Swan Queen \nfans to queerbaiting, gaslighting, and threats from queerphobic OUAT fans are excellent \nillustrations of how queer fans experience queer melancholia (Wilson, 2015). \n“Fantagonism” \t\nContemporary online instances of marginalization such as the ones discussed in my \nFindings section align with and support Derek Johnson’s argument that fandom (that is, Fandom) \ncontains contentious factions of disparate groups of fans (2007, 285-286). Television fandoms, in \nparticular, comprise of many fandom groups that hold their own ideas, beliefs, and passions as a \nstandard for active participation. These disparate beliefs among factions allow for boundary lines \nto be drawn and rigorously assessed, maintained, and renegotiated by group members. Johnson’s \ncoining of the term “fantagonism” has inspired the ways in which we study the constitutive \nnature of hegemonic fandoms and how they interact with one another (285). Keeping the concept \nof “fantagonism” in mind may aid us further in theorizing queer fandom so that we may be able \nto better map out its existence within the larger realm of Fandom and its members’ constant \n(re)negotiations among each other as well as with those who wish to silence them in an effort to \nmaintain the primacy of the traditional through heterosexist discourses such as those perpetuated \nin shows like Once Upon a Time.  \nTo speak more on silence and repression, we turn to Foucault’s suppositions regarding \nthe discourse of repression (Foucault, 1990, 17). Arguing that attempts to repress sexuality in \n\t\t 55\t\nVictorian era England ultimately led to “an explosion” of discourse on the topic, Foucault \nillustrates that there was \"an institutional incitement to speak about [sex], and to do so more and \nmore” (Foucault, 1990, 18). This, of course, refers to heterocentric sex that can be “regulated for \nthe greater good of all” (Foucault, 1990, 24). The agencies of power in relation to this project are \nthe show runners and the fans that constitute the hegemonic Fandom for the show, as it is their \nactions and beliefs that control who can fall in love and have their own “Happily Ever After.” \nMoreover, it is these groups that control which narratives can be presented to the rest of the \nworld even as Fandom undermines the legitimacy of counter narratives such as those developed \nby Swan Queen fans on Tumblr. Ultimately, I find that the gaslighting of Swan Queen fans by \nthe show’s producers and anti-Swan Queen fans’ attempts at silencing the queer fandom are not \nnew tactics in the slightest. Rather, it seems evident that a growing number of Swan Queen fans \nare agitated by these tactics intent to further marginalize them within Fandom. However, many \nare asking themselves and each other “why do we say we are oppressed or think we are \noppressed?” (Foucault, 1990, 8-9) \nQueer Melancholy: What Queer Fandom Offers Us  \t\nWhat matters to me are the responses and reactions from the Swan Queen fandom to \nthese (f)antagonisms. Queer resistance to hegemony is, in of itself, always a political act as one \nmust acknowledge their dual role in the conflict as an individual fighting for one’s own rights \n(e.g. an affirming act) as well as part of a marginalized and demonized population of people \nthroughout much of history (Butler, 1993). Cvetkovich (2003) insists that engagement with the \npast in the present demonstrates how important this type of melancholic state is for queer politics \n(cited in Mortimer-Sandilands & Erickson, 2010, 342). I think it safe to assume that many queer \nfandom members understand and acknowledge the history of oppression, death, and depression \n\t\t 56\t\nthat the AIDS crisis created during the 1980s and 1990s as well as the rapid coalescence of the \nqueer community in response to media and the government’s placement of blame and \nstigmatization on an already mourning population of queer individuals (Bersani, 1987; Crimp, \n1989; Butler, 2004). They may also know that the queer community retains and curates feelings \nof what Cvetkovich (2003) and Butler (2004) refer to as queer melancholy even as new obstacles \ndevelop—such as seemingly frivolous “fandom wars” between straight and queer fans over their \nfavorite television shows. Attending to both the past and the present from a queer fan’s \npositionality requires one to know, deep down, that their existence in the world around them is \ncontested and hated by some even as they themselves celebrate their queerness and seek out \nothers like them in order to critically address the heterocentricity inherent, perpetuated, and \nendorsed in their favorite television shows.  \nTo briefly sum up my thoughts, queer fandom offers a space to deconstruct heterocentric \ndiscourses such as “True Love” and “Happily Ever After” and reconstruct in their stead \nindividualized ideations of what queer means through ever-changing and ever-growing \nrelationships with our favorite characters. This space offers up endless potential for the kinds of \nqueer world-building that queer theorists have been calling on for decades. Indeed, Berlant & \nWarner (1998) remind us that, “Heterosexuality involves so many practices that are not sex that a \nworld in which this hegemonic cluster would not be dominant is, at this point, unimaginable. We \nare trying to bring that world into being” (557). Queer fandom, it seems, remains committed to \ndoing the same.  \n  \n\t\t 57\t\n \n \n \n \n \nVI.\tCONCLUSION:\tReclaiming\tTheir\tOwn\tSpace\tand\tStriving\tfor\ta\tQueer\t“Happily\tEver\tAfter”\t\n \nThe purpose of my research has been to answer my research questions, of which there are \ntwo: First, how are members of the Swan Queen fan community developing counter narratives of \nlove by engaging in meaning-making processes and interpretations of Once Upon a Time \n(OUAT)? And secondly, how do they talk about the purpose and importance of their narratives \nfor themselves or the SQ fan community? \nIn answering the first question, I have determined that the majority of the fans in the \nSwan Queen fandom disagree with the storylines that developed during season 3 and created \ntheir own counter narratives (1) based upon their queer readings and interpretations of Regina \nand Emma’s characters, their interactions with one another, etc. Additionally, these queer fans \n(2) bond based on their similar interpretations of the show and discuss their reasons for shipping \nSwan Queen together. Most importantly, the Swan Queen fandom developed out of opposition to \nthe show runners’ continued focus on and celebration of heterosexist representations of “True \nLove” and “Happily Ever After” in line with Rich’s notion of compulsory heterosexuality \n(1980). Members of the Swan Queen fandom passionately argue that such representations of \nfairytale romance are potentially dangerous in that they portray and romanticize rape culture to \naudience members and that the show runners are complicit in this action even as they foreclose \non the notion of a queer romance between Emma and Regina. As such, (3) Swan Queen fans \nreject the show’s narratives of these two notions through rejection of the canonical Captain Swan \nand Outlaw Queen relationships and push for more inclusive storylines and relationships. \n\t\t 58\t\nAnswering the second question, I found that Swan Queen fans maintain that the \nimportance and purpose of their counter narratives is to engage with the fandom community \nbecause they (1) feel that the show is queerbaiting them and are attempting to counteract \nnegative effects of queerbaiting, (2) use their narratives to critique the show’s heterosexist \nstorylines as empty and dangerous, and (3) respond to gaslighting by the show runners that then \nencourages (4) non-queer fans of OUAT to attack and threaten members of the Swan Queen \nfandom online. \nThe specific text posts displayed above and throughout my Findings section represent \nseveral types of antagonistic actions against Swan Queen fans and non-Swan Queen fans alike, \nas they promote aggressive and potentially harmful behaviors in the name of fandom alone. \nThus, Swan Queen fans believe that it is part of their intervention, as a queer fandom and as fan \nactivists, to utilize Tumblr as a queer counterpublic (Renninger, 2015) to highlight and address \nthe aggressions and queerphobic rhetoric that has emerged in the online environment in an effort \nto re-claim and proclaim a safe space for themselves and to push for their own queer “Happily \nEver After.” \nScope and Limitations of the Research \t\nFor the purpose of this study, I have chosen not to focus on certain aspects of the online \nSwan Queen fandom such as themed multimedia events, socials, and contests that are popular \namong fans that participate regularly; for example, wittyoncer creates fan fiction writing \nchallenges with certain themes for each round where other fans can then submit their own works. \nIn a similar vein, I have not included qualitative analyses of Swan Queen fan fiction published or \ncrosslinked on Tumblr as it became clear very early on in data collection that such a project \ndemanded more energy and time than I had allotted for myself.  I have also chosen not to \n\t\t 59\t\nexamine the graphics (GIFS and videos) that wittyoncer posts or reblogs, as these graphics \ntypically do not incorporate direct discussion between the blogger and other Swan Queen fans. \nThis is not to say that these graphics bear no analytical fruit. On the contrary, any future attempts \nat analysis of GIF-use within queer fandom spaces would be greatly welcomed. In this project’s \ncase, textual posts proved to be the most abundant as well as extremely rich in data. As the \nspecific timeframe I have chosen suggests, it is not possible to examine wittyoncer’s (or other \nSwan Queen fans’) reactions to events that occur before March 2014 and after December 2014. \nThe members of the Swan Queen fandom discussed in my analysis have formed both \ntheir own individualized understandings of queerness as well as a co-constructed, ever-changing \none that circulates on Tumblr throughout the rest of the community. I believe it safe to assume \nthat these fans’ education levels contributed to the ways in which they discussed issues such as \ngaslighting, queerbaiting, and heteronormativity. Furthermore, as the content has been collected \nfrom an individual’s blog, I cannot ignore the bias maintained throughout as it has been in \nwittyoncer’s discretion to select which texts posts and topics pertaining to Once Upon a Time to \nreblog and comment on. Therefore, this study is not generalizable to the entire queer fandom \ncommunity but may provide an example of comparison to others in the future. Additionally, it \nproves paramount that research on queer fandom studies such as the Swan Queen fandom \nobserve and analyze the ways in which these fans perceive and contend with race and ethnicity \nas it presents itself within the show and filters in to online community blog spaces. \nLastly, I still find myself struck by the notion of queer fandom spaces such as Tumblr \nhaving to be heavily defended by its members from an influx of non-queer fans intent on \nsilencing queer shipping practices and enforcing, instead, their own normalizing practices \n(Foucault, 1990, pp. 147). There are two questions I find myself asking at the moment: At what \n\t\t 60\t\ncost(s) do members of a queer fandom defend their own space when there is no foreseeable relief \non the horizon? For Swan Queen fans, in particular, what are the their hopes and future outlooks \nfor the queer fandom or for the show?  \n\t\t 61\t\n  \n \nWORKS CITED \nAhmed, S. (2004).

    "abstract": "This thesis examines a queer fan community for the television show Once Upon a Time (OUAT) that utilizes the social networking site Tumblr as their primary base of fan activity. The Swan Queen fan community is comprised of individuals that collectively support and celebrate a non-canon romantic relationship between two of the female lead characters of the show rather than the canonic, heterocentric relationships that occur between the two women and their respective male love interests. I answer two research questions in this study: First, how are members of the Swan Queen fan community developing counter narratives of love by engaging in meaning-making processes and interpretations of OUAT? And secondly, how do they talk about the purpose and importance of their narratives for themselves or the Swan Queen fan community?  In order to answer my research questions, I consider how the Swan Queen fandom developed and how they convey their meaning-making strategies online. To do this, I have analyzed the Tumblr blog of one Swan Queen fan and have used their blog as a nexus between other Swan Queen fans that use the website for their fan activities. Swan Queen fans argue that the show runners of OUAT use subtextual codes within canonical storylines in an effort to queerbait the show’s queer audience members. Moreover, the show runners refute the notion that they are queerbating queer fans at all by arguing that the fans’ perceptions are baseless and that any perceived queering of the characters Emma Swan and Regina Mills is purely “unintentional.” This response has only served to alienate the show’s queer fan base further as it led to increased complaints that the show runners were gaslighting the entire queer fandom. Additionally, Swan Queen fans maintain that the show’s introduction of canonical storylines featuring romantic relationships between Regina and Robin Hood and Emma and Captain Hook are heterosexist and dangerous. The storylines between Emma and Captain Hook, queer fans argue, often promote rape culture, thus perpetuating violence against both queer and non-queer audiences through storylines grounded in fairytale concepts of “True Love” and “Happily Ever After”. As such, Swan Queen fans push back against and reject this violence through their own interpretations and counter narratives of “True Love”. In accordance with previous research, I have found that historically marginalized groups such as the queer community continue to experience widespread and often aggressive attacks by queerphobic individuals and hate groups that are intent on preserving traditionally heterocentric institutions in our society, including (but not limited to) mainstream media broadcasting. Furthermore, fandom has become institutionalized in the same manner and typically operates within hegemonic, heterocentric standards. Conversely, queer fandoms such as the Swan Queen fandom operate outside of these standards, and fans respond to antagonistic efforts to silence them or cast them in an inaccurate manner by creating close-knit social communities to combat these actions and provide a space wherein individuals are able to counter dominant narratives that serve to further marginalize them. This study elucidates how this effort may occur and questions the effect this membership has on those who participate within a queer fandom. It is imperative that such research takes place, as there are very few accounts of how queer fans navigate the complex intersection between fandom and queerness",
