INTRODUCTIONWhen the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion(“ODPHP”) released its Healthy People 2020 goals and objectives, itrecognized the public health needs of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, andtransgender (“LGBT”) community for the first time.1  The stated goalof Healthy People 2020 is to “improve the health, safety, and well-being of [LGBT] individuals.”2  One barrier to obtaining the neededinformation for achieving this goal is a lack of necessary data collec-tion, particularly as it regards the LGBTQ+ community.  This paperwill provide a basic overview of health inequities experienced by theLGBTQ+ community and introduce interventions of interest to the le-gal and public health communities.II. DESCRIPTION OF  LGBTQ+ COMMUNITYA. ALL COMMUNITIES ARE NOT THE SAMEWhile the LGBTQ+ community is frequently discussed as onecommunity, it is actually a collection of unique communities.  TheLGBTQ+ community is inclusive of both sexual orientation and gen-der identity (“SOGI”) minorities.  It is important to note both the simi-larities and the differences between the groups in order to adequatelyexamine health inequities in a way which meaningfully provides ave-nues to lower the impact of marginalization and increase wellbeing.The discussion of the LGBTQ+ community as a whole, without consid-ering the unique differences among the groups, can gloss over mean-† Associate Professor, Indiana University School of Social Work, Indianapolis In-diana; Assistant Professor of Social Work and Law, Indiana University Robert H.

LesbianThe term lesbian generally refers to women who are romanticallyor sexually attracted to other women.6  These women include all fe-male-identified individuals.  For example, a transgender woman7 whois attracted to women could be a lesbian, although she may identify asqueer or pansexual.  Likewise, women who like women (“WLW”) mayprefer to be called gay or queer instead.82. GayThe term gay generally refers to persons who are attracted tomembers of the same sex.9  This includes transgender men who likemen and transgender women who like women.  Recently, the term gayhas been applied most commonly to men, though some WLW preferthe term gay rather than lesbian.103. INST. OF MED. (US) COMM.

The communities of men who have sex with men (“MSM”) or women who havesex with women (“WLW”) but do not adopt a non-heterosexual identity will not be ex-plicitly discussed in this paper.  It is important to note that some of the public healthimplications here (medical knowledge and treatment) may be applicable to thesegroups, but some of the issues around stigma and even inclusion as a part of theLGBTQ+ community are beyond this paper’s scope.5.

It generally includes thosewho are attracted to more than one sex.11  Some use this term only forthose who identify within the gender binary,12 while others prefer theterm pansexual for those who are attracted to a person regardless ofgender identity or sex.  Most data collection processes will include inthe term bisexual anyone attracted to more than one sex or gender.The term is about the attraction, not the current relationship.13  So,even if a person is currently in a heterosexual relationship,14 that per-son may still identify as bisexual.4. Transgender and NonbinaryTransgender is a broad term for those whose gender identity doesnot comport with their assigned sex at birth (“ASAB”).  Persons whoare transgender may identify as a man or woman, or they may findtheir gender identity does not fit on the gender binary and identify asnonbinary.  Nonbinary identities include anyone who does not identifyas exclusively male or female, including those who identify as gender-queer or gender fluid.  Transgender and nonbinary identities areabout gender and not sexual orientation.  Persons who are trans-gender or nonbinary may identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual,pansexual, etc. in terms of their sexual orientation.  Sexual orienta-tion will be in reference to their gender identity, not their ASAB.  Forexample, transgender women who are attracted to women identify aslesbians.155. The Q+ in LGBTQ+The Q in LGBTQ+ can stand for queer or questioning.  For pur-poses of this paper, Q+ is inclusive of the many SOGI minorities inaddition to the definitions above.  Examples may include those whoare questioning their sexual or gender identity.  While queer has hada controversial history as a slur, as well as an empowered reclaimedterm, a resurgence of individuals are identifying as queer or pansex-ual because they are sexual identities that are inclusive of many gen-ders, including transgender and nonbinary.  Others who do notidentify within a specific group on the LGBT spectrum and do not fit11. Wendy B.

Intersectional Identities Within the LGBTQ+ CommunityThe LGBTQ+ community is wildly diverse in age, race, ethnicity,gender, geography, and other demographics.  Although the communityis often seen as monolithic with white cisgender gay men front andcenter, the community is far more diverse than it is often represented.Despite this diversity, studies rarely explore comparisons between in-tersectional identities, particularly concerning intersections betweensexual orientation, gender, race, and ethnicity.17  Studying intersec-tional identities,18 particularly studying gender along with race andethnicity,19 could increase understanding of within-group (e.g., by age,race, ASAB)20 and between-groups (e.g., binary transgender andnonbinary)21 comparisons.A recent article advocates for LGBTQ research to be conductedwith an intersectional approach that explores the differences betweensexual orientation, gender, and the identities within each group.22Such an intersectional approach is crucial because when between-groups comparisons are included, unique experiences can be under-16.

A statewide study oftransgender and nonbinary individuals in Colorado conducted a differ-ential analysis between gender identity, sexual orientation, and age.The study found individuals who were older and heterosexual wereless likely to delay care due to anticipated discrimination23 as com-pared to young and queer individuals.  Compared to transfeminine re-spondents, transmasculine respondents were twice as likely to delaycare and nonbinary individuals were 25% less likely to delay care.24  Asimilar study exploring the intersectional identities of gender andLGB on outness and well-being found that those who identify as a gen-der minority scored significantly lower on well-being and thrivingscales than those who identified as cisgender and LGB.25  Recentstudies that have focused on intersectional identities within theLGBTQ+ community have demonstrated a need within the scientificand medical communities to view gender from a multi-dimensionaland intersectional perspective.26In addition to experiencing homophobia and racism from societyat large, LGBTQ people of color (“POC”) may experience intragroupmarginalization, such as racism within an LGBTQ community orhomophobia within an ethnic community.27  Research has shown thatBlack LGBTQ people experience a disproportionate level of disap-proval for their sexual identity, which may lead to a conflict of iden-tity.28  However, presence and awareness of LGBTQ POC has beenshown to ameliorate conflict between LGBTQ and racial and ethnicidentities.29  Acceptance plays a key role in a person’s ability to re-move competition between their sexual identity and racial identity.30When a person does not feel a sense of belonging as part of a minoritygroup, it can lead to further self-marginalization.31  Findings from an-other study exploring the tacit and implicit self-marginalization ofblack nonbinary students emphasized the invisibility of nonbinaryidentities, and even more so black nonbinary individuals, not only23.

HEALTH INEQUTIES DESCRIBEDA. BEHAVIORAL HEALTHMembers of the LGBTQ community have an enormous risk ofhealth inequities in the field of behavioral health.  Overall, the com-munity experiences an increase in the incidence of mental health chal-lenges, especially suicide when compared to their cisgender andheterosexual counterparts.35  A systematic review of mental healthdisorders among LGB individuals showed that depression, anxiety,and substance misuse were at least one-and-a-half times more com-mon among sexual minorities compared to their heterosexual peers.36While the LGB community experiences a suicide attempt rate of twoto three times that of the general population, the transgender commu-nity experiences suicide attempts at nine times the rate of the generalpopulation.37  Additionally, studies of gender minorities have shownextremely high rates of suicidal ideation,38 with suicidal ideation ashigh as 51% and attempted suicide rates as high as 30% among trans-32.

LGBTQ POC face racism and LGBTQ-baseddiscrimination, the latter sometimes within their own racial and eth-nic communities, which contribute to compound adverse effects onmental health that can lead to suicidal ideation.43  Furthermore,LGBT individuals may be further marginalized and, thus, be at higherrisk of suicide due to the additional barriers of homelessness, incarcer-ation (whether in the juvenile justice system or in prison), and mentalillness.44Age may also be a consideration for additional behavioral healthrisks and coping among older LGBTQ adults.  Regarding support,older LGBTQ adults may have fewer family connections and rely moreon families of choice, such as long-term friends, social organizations,small groups or networks of people,45 and have less support in illnessand disability if they did not raise children.46  Older LGBTQ+ adultsare also at higher risk of poor mental health, smoking, excessivedrinking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.47  Due to his-torical LGBTQ-based discrimination experienced throughout theirlives—perhaps one of the more impactful factors on behavioral39.

This may be especially concerning for older transgenderadults whose gender may be exposed during physical assistance.49Higher psychological distress and behavioral problems were re-ported for youth whose parents rejected their gender nonconformitycompared to more accepting parents.50  In another study, transgenderyouth reported verbal and physical abuse, high rates of depression,and 47% of respondents reported attempting suicide.51  Conversely,research continues to reinforce the importance of family acceptance,which has been found to be a protective factor against suicidality52that serves to promote positive health outcomes.53Recent studies are replete with the corrosive effects of a hostileenvironment, such as stigma, prejudice, and discrimination, onLGBTQ individuals’ overall health.  In addition to the corrosive effectsof discrimination on mental health, stigma and oppression may inhibitone’s ability to cope and further traumatize individuals.54  Whenunique experiences are examined among groups within the LGBTcommunity, the disparities can be even greater, stressing the impor-tance of this information to better serve each population.55  Thesefindings highlight the important role of mental and physical health-care providers and organizations to support LGBTQ clients and theirfamilies, to provide competent services, and to create inclusive and48.

Violent InjuryAndrea L. Roberts reported in a national study that the differ-ences in exposure to violence due to sexual orientation were “strik-ing.”58  LGB populations were almost twice as likely to have beenexposed to violence.59  In fact, a key finding of the study was that “les-bians, gay men, bisexuals, and heterosexuals with same-sex sexualpartners—but not heterosexuals with same-sex attraction only—hadsignificantly elevated risk of exposure to nearly every [traumatic]event type except war-related traumas.”60  Sexual orientation minori-ties are at an increased risk of experiencing intimate partner violence,sexual assault, physical and sexual abuse in childhood, and violence intheir communities, including hate crimes.61Violence in the transgender community is particularly concern-ing.  The results of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey indicate an in-creased risk of violence and harm to mental and physical health.Verbal harassment, physical attacks and harassment, and physical orsexual assault accessing bathrooms in the last year were all attributedto reactions to individuals being transgender.62  Eight percent of sur-vey respondents attributed urinary tract infections, kidney infections,or other kidney problems in the past year to avoiding restrooms forfear of violence.63School is a significant factor for LGBTQ youth.

MITIGATORS OF NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMESAcceptance and support have been found to be some of the strong-est mitigators to disparate health outcomes for persons in theLGBTQ+ community.  As policies are designed, the potential to posi-tively influence acceptance and support may be variables to consider.Below is additional information regarding the kinds of behaviorswhich mitigate negative health outcomes.1. Family SupportResearch reinforces the importance of family acceptance, a protec-tive factor for LGBTQ youth.66  Family acceptance has been found tonot only be a protective factor against depression, substance abuse,and suicidal ideation and behaviors67 but also to promote higher self-esteem, social support, and general health status among LGBTQyouth and adolescents.68  In one of the first studies to assess gendernonconformity among LGB youth, 30% of participants reported nega-tive reactions from parents who discouraged gender atypical behaviorthrough counseling, punishment or restriction, and insistence tochange.6964.

School AcceptanceSchool acceptance has been found to be associated with lower anx-iety, depression, skipping of classes, and negative coping mechanisms,such as drinking and smoking.70  In particular, the presence of schoolGSAs (previously Gay-Straight Alliances, now Gender and SexualityAlliances) have been shown to have a significant impact on the wellbe-ing of LGBTQ youth, as well as lower rates of truancy, tobacco use,alcohol use, attempted suicide, and casual sexual behavior.71  Evenwithout actively participating, the mere presence of a GSA was astrong indicator of well-being as reported by LGBTQ young adults72and an official sign of support.73Additionally, GSAs are a meaningful venue for youth to engage ingender and sexual orientation activism.74  Despite the need for sup-port, research has also shown that LGBTQ youth lack access to suchprotective resources.75  In the 2015 National School Climate Surveyassessing the experience of LGBTQ youth, 23.1% of youth ages thir-teen to twenty-one identified as nonbinary, genderqueer, or anothergender.76  The majority, 56.6% of the sample, reported their school didnot have policies that addressed the needs of gender minority stu-dents, which were offered as a result of not including nonbinaryneeds.77  Furthermore, even when anti-discrimination policies are inplace, Jennifer Schindel reported from her fieldnotes that teachersmay not know how to proceed with such things as bathroom usage andaccepted pronouns with gender minority students.78  In related find-ings, transgender and nonbinary high school students reported signifi-70.71.

HEALTH ACCESSBarriers to healthcare access have a significant impact on mentaland physical health for LGBTQ+ individuals.  Structural and personalforces can work to either assist in access or make it more difficult.The Institute of Medicine describes four primary areas recognized fornegatively impacting health access for the LGBTQ community.1. Stigma (Personal Level)86Of the many barriers for LGBTQ individuals, stigma87 is associ-ated with lower levels of health care access.  Stigma can be exper-ienced explicitly in the form of slurs or violence (“enacted”), indirectlyvia conversations not directed at the person but nevertheless harmfulor in conversations directed at the person with heteronormative lan-guage (“felt”), and via the person’s internalized belief learned overtime from a society which treats SOGI minorities as others (“internal-ized”).88  Furthermore, anticipated discrimination is a barrier to ac-cessing healthcare for many sexual and gender minorities.89  All ofthese forms of stigma make it more unlikely that the person impactedwill trust a health system to be able to meet their needs free of bias.Conversely, a positive LGBTQ identity has been found to bolster resil-ience and better cope with future minority-related stressors.9085. Budge et al., supra note 18; Cara Jean Hale et al., Social Support and PhysicalHealth: The Importance of Belonging, 53 J. AM. C. HEALTH 276 (2005).86.

OF MED., THE HEALTH OF LESBIAN, GAY,BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE: BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR BETTERUNDERSTANDING (2011).  Structural stigma, or institutional stigma, is the manifestationof stigma within the institutions of society.  Patrick W. Corrigan et al., StructuralStigma in State Legislation, 56 PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES 557 (2005).

Vaughan & Rodriguez, supra note 82.440 CREIGHTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 522. Structural StigmaStructural stigma impacts access to services whether or not theprovider or the individual themselves has perpetrated or experiencedstigma.  These are institutional policies and/or attitudes adopted bysociety at large, which fail to support inclusion.  For example, hospitalrules around visitation of same-sex partners, particularly prior tomarriage equality, impact the patient whether or not individual prov-iders act to stigmatize patients.  These structural problems leaveLGBTQ individuals without needed access to services and support.3. Professional Knowledge and TrainingWhile the American Medical Association has recommended im-proved and increased training in LGBTQ care, the lack of culturalcompetency across healthcare fields impacts the willingness of theLGBTQ community to enter into treatment with those who do not un-derstand their needs.91  A review of the literature shows a lack of suf-ficient training in the needs of the LGBTQ communities.92  Somepractitioners report feeling incompetent to work with LGBT clients,which may be due to a lack of personal initiative along with a lack ofagency responsiveness to prepare professionals.93  Research hasshown a significant relationship between LGB-competence amongmental health practitioners and organizational LGBT-competence,with the latter increasing the former, strengthening the argument forneeded LGBT training.94Transgender individuals are particularly impacted in the area ofpractitioner competence due to the cultural discomfort with those whodo not conform to gender norms.95  A systematic review of literatureon mental health providers’ attitudes towards transgender peopleshowed more frequent positive attitudes compared to the general pop-ulation, with most negative attitudes among white, heterosexual menwho identified as religious and conservative.96  However, some mentalhealth professionals report feeling unprepared for working with trans-91.

HEALTH INSURANCEWhile marriage equality has positively impacted the ability of theLGBTQ community to access employer-sponsored health insurance,disparities in the employment levels of the LGBTQ community, in-cluding a lack of anti-discrimination labor laws in many states, stillcreate disparities between the LGBTQ community and the generalpopulation in health coverage.  Health insurance policies on itemssuch as gender confirmation surgery (“GCS”) and hormone replace-ment treatments (“HRTs”) can also create structural barriers tohealth access.100  In particular, even those with GCS-inclusive policiescontinue to be written on the binary spectrum and, thus, excludenonbinary individuals.  For example, someone assigned female atbirth (“AFAB”) attempting to access top surgery101 who has an insur-ance policy that uses the language “to affirm their male identity” as arequirement for deeming the surgery medically necessary, therefore,excludes anyone who does not identify their gender as male (e.g.,nonbinary individuals).  Individually, and especially accumulatively,these barriers create a significant burden to the LGBTQ communityas individuals attempt to access health care.  Health policy discus-sions should include these issues if we are to begin to increase healthcare access for LGBTQ individuals.97. Jill M.

Non-Discrimination LegislationAffirmation and inclusion of sexual and gender minorities seemedto be gaining momentum the early 2000s, as legislative and organiza-tional policies, including the legalization of gay marriage, increased inthe inclusion of non-discrimination policies.102  However, in 2016, thechanging sociopolitical climate saw an increase in discriminatorystate-level legislation with  proposed and passed laws with negativerepercussions, particularly for gender minorities.  Currently onlynineteen states and the District of Columbia have protections againstdiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity con-cerning statewide public accommodations.103In 2011, the United Nation’s General Assembly Report acknowl-edged the discrimination faced by LGBTQ individuals, as documentedover the previous two decades, and has recommended each nation torecognize the rights of transgender individuals.104  More recently, theEuropean Union’s Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly pro-posed the transgender-inclusive Resolution 2048.  Of the proposed pol-icies, the most nonbinary-applicable were to remove required mentalhealth diagnoses for changing gender markers and to recommendcountries include a third gender option.105  Additionally, research con-cerning transgender experiences was called for to include discrimina-tion, hate crimes, suicide prevention, and the effectiveness of anti-discrimination legislation.1062.

H.B. 2 was reportedly a response to several trans-affirming bathroom bills that allowed transgender individuals to usethe bathroom according to their gender.109  Conversely, N.C. H.B. 2required transgender and nonbinary people to use the bathroom thataligned with their ASAB.110  Although it has since been repealed, N.C.H.B. 2 ignited sixteen other states to propose similar legislation.111The implications of such requirements placed transgender andnonbinary people at risk of physical and mental health risks as a re-sult of facing daily suspicion, harassment, and hostility.  According tothe 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey,112 bathrooms continue to be in-creasingly dangerous spaces for transgender persons with increas-ingly harmful legislation.  When attempting to use bathrooms, 9% ofrespondents reported being denied access, 12% reported being ver-bally harassed, 1% reported being physically attacked or sexually as-saulted with the majority, 53%, of nonbinary respondents reportingavoidance of bathrooms sometimes to always in the last twelvemonths for fear of harassment and other potential invidious forms ofdiscrimination.  For fear of confrontation, 59% of respondents avoidedpublic restrooms in the last year and 32% limited fluid intake to limitnecessary bathroom use with 8% reporting urinary tract infection orrelated infections in the past year due to bathroom avoidance.113Even more disparaging is the fact that being denied access to bath-rooms has been linked to suicide among transgender individuals.114The argument of bathroom bill proponents has focused on the pro-tection of women and children from the perceived threat of trans-gender sexual predators.115  Despite the heightened fear, there havebeen no recorded cases of assault in a bathroom by a transgender per-son in the United States.116 Ultimately, the sexual predator argumenthas been called a red herring.117  The Obama administration took aclear stance on bathroom bills with a statement from the Departments108.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care ActThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) pro-vided LGBTQ individuals increased protections and access to ser-vices,120 even though gender diverse individuals still experiencegatekeeping, such as required professional letters to validate theirgender,121 and discrimination in health care.122  With the emergenceof the World Professional Association of Transgender Health(“WPATH”) standards of care for transgender and gender non-con-forming (“SOC”) clients, guidelines have been established with the in-tent to guide practitioners in providing affirmative care.123  Particularto nonbinary individuals, to the most recent version (“SOC 7”)changed from binary to nonbinary language and included a statementto recommend practitioners not impose the gender binary on youth.124These modifications evidenced an increasing professional awarenessof nonbinary identities and established a need for more inclusivepractices.125F. MINORITY STRESS THEORYThe minority stress model was developed by Ilan H.

Stigma associated with nonconformity to prevailingsexual orientation and gender norms is a collective experience forLGBT individuals and, therefore, a significant social determinant ofhealth.127Minority stress has been categorized as distal or external128  andproximal or internal129 processes.130  Enacted stigma has been re-ported to range from seemingly innocuous remarks to physical assaultand death threats.131  Minority stress also results from anticipateddiscrimination, concealment of identity, and internalized stigma (ac-ceptance and internalization of a negative message about one’sidentity).132Michael Hendricks and Ryan Testa theorized additional genderidentity-specific stressors of expectations of violence and discrimina-tion and internalized transphobia.133  Gender nonconformity wasfound to be a consistent and robust predictor of psychological distress,which was theorized to be in part due to the hypervigilance related torejection based on perceptions of gender expression.134  Some trans-gender and nonbinary individuals report anticipating rejection “any-time they left home and entered a public space.”135Another group with unique minority stressors is older, LGBTQadults.  In addition to the barriers to care faced by LGBTQ youth andadults, such as a lack of culturally competent providers and exper-iences with, and a fear of, discrimination, they face additional barriersbecause of isolation and a lack of social services specific to theirneeds.136  Over 1.5 million LGBTQ people are over sixty-five in theUnited States, a number expected to double by 2030,137 and currently127.

Unfortunately, itis difficult to use these methodologies for the LGBTQ population asdata collection for this population is scarce and utterly lacking in re-sources  Healthy People 2020, an initiative of ODPHP, created goalsfor increased data collection for the LGBTQ community as a necessarystep to increase the public health community’s ability to serve thispopulation better.  Recommendations included extensive surveys onthe demographic and social characteristics of the SOGI community;data gathering on LGBTQ household composition; surveys of incomeand education in the SOGI community, including comparisons ofpartnered and unpartnered persons; examination of impact of barriersto care; and studies of the impact of stigma at personal and structurallevels on LGBTQ health.143  Without this baseline data, it will bechallenging to move forward in determining the best ways to serve theLGBTQ community.

EDUCATIONDespite the American Medical Association’s recommendation formore considerable training on LGBTQ topics, there exists a lack ofcultural competency in the field, which impacts the willingness of theLGBTQ community to enter into treatment with those who do not un-derstand their needs.145  The medical community continues to needtraining regarding the needs of the LGBTQ community.  Providers re-port discomfort or feeling unprepared when taking histories and un-derstanding the treatment needs of the LGBTQ community.146Transgender individuals are particularly impacted by this area.  Con-versely, having “transgender-inclusive” primary care practitioners hasbeen found to significantly reduce the likelihood that transgender andnonbinary individuals will experience depression or suicidal ideations,as well as a strong predictor that transgender and nonbinary individu-als will seek medical interventions and not delay care due to fears ofdiscrimination.147Recent studies in the field speak to the need for an ongoing com-mitment for competency training for working with LGBTQ clients.Education for health care providers that are culturally responsiveacross sexual orientation and gender identity is extremely impor-tant.148  In addition to the medical field, LGBTQ individuals wouldbenefit from professionals in all social service professions receivingLGBTQ education, especially in schools. Formal LGBTQ educationplays an essential role in removing the onus on the marginalized pop-ulation to be educators.  Furthermore, priority LGBTQ education cancontribute to a more welcoming and affirming environment forrecruiting and retaining LGBTQ professionals.144.

On January 20, 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13765 “Minimizingthe Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Re-peal,” that requires, among other things, “[t]o the maximum extent permitted by law,the Secretary of Health and Human Services . . . shall exercise all authority and discre-tion available to [ ] waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation ofany provision or requirement of the [PPACA] that would impose a fiscal burden on anyState or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, health-care providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of2019] LGBTQ+ INDIVIDUALS 449of Health and Human Services to waive requirements of the PPACAwhich would cause fiscal or administrative burdens to states or indi-viduals.  This order, in addition to the court’s injunction, effectivelyundermined the goals of the rule interpreting section 1557 to includesexual orientation and gender identity.  In May 2019, the administra-tion set forth a new proposed rule for comment.154  This proposed ruleexplicitly changes the administrative interpretation of sex discrimina-tion to be a binary one, allowing states to determine for themselveswhether or not to include protections for sexual orientation and gen-der identity.155The next year will be a pivotal one for those seeking to ensureaccess and non-discrimination for the LGBTQ community.  The Su-preme Court has granted certiorari to three cases, which will examinewhether Title VII workplace discrimination protections apply to sex-ual orientation and transgender individuals.156  While these cases arebased on Title VII, the Court’s interpretation of sex in under Title VIIwill have an impact on Title IX and other civil rights laws where theterm “sex” is used.  The 2019 Supreme Court Term will have signifi-cant implications for LGBTQ access to health care in the future.V. CONCLUSIONIt is important to note that, as discussed above, it was not untilthe Healthy People 2020 initiative that the LGBTQ community wasincluded in this prominent national public health objective.  Thoughthe LGBTQ community has been with us from the beginning, it hasonly relatively recently received attention for the pertinent health dis-parities and inequities the community experiences.  As the publichealth community continues to improve its ability to work with andfor this community, the legal and policy-making community would dowell to increase its understanding of the impact of policy on the com-munity.  The next few years will be critical for this work, as all threebranches of government continue to grapple with the best ways tohealth insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.”  Exec.

The stated goal of Healthy People 2020 is to “improve the health, safety, and wellbeing of [LGBT] individuals.” One barrier to obtaining the needed information for achieving this goal is a lack of necessary data collection, particularly as it regards the LGBTQ+ community. This paper will provide a basic overview of health inequities experienced by the LGBTQ+ community and introduce interventions of interest to the legal and public health communities",
