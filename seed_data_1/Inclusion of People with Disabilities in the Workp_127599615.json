However, disability \nis an often forgotten minority group.1 1 in 5 people will acquire a disability in their lifetime, and \nindividuals with disabilities are a major source of untapped talent due to social stigma that they \ncan’t or don’t want to work.2 While many companies are taking steps toward diversity, they \noften spend less time, energy, and resources on the inclusion piece.1 In many organizations, \nHuman Resources sets the Diversity and Inclusion strategy. There are several concrete, practical \nsteps that HR leaders can take to enhance feelings of inclusion for people with disabilities in \ntheir workplace.  \n \nClimate \nInclusion is about feeling like a person belongs in an organization. Ideally, employees should feel \nlike they “belong” while at the same time being valued for their unique characteristics and \nperspectives (see appendix A).3  However, employees with disabilities tend to be less satisfied \nwith their organization and its workplace climate and also perceive fewer opportunities for \nadvancement than their non-disabled colleagues.4 These perceptions and well as perceptions of \nnon-disabled of workplace disability inclusiveness can greatly influence both representation and \ndisclosure rates among people with disabilities. 5 \nDisclosure \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act defines disability as an impairment that substantially limits \none or more major life activities.6 Think about it – how many disabilities can you name that are \nnot visible? It is easy to know if someone has a disability when they are in a wheelchair or blind \nor even deaf. It is not so easy to identify when a person’s disability is anxiety disorder or Crohn’s \ndisease. As the workforce ages and the prevalence of disability increases, it is becoming more \nimportant for employers to create a workplace climate that encourages disclosure and reduces \nthe likelihood of negative consequences for employees and applicants who disclose their \ndisabilities.7 Disability disclosure can help make sure that employees receive appropriate \nworkplace accommodations which increases their likelihood of success on the job.7 Several \npieces of inclusion affect disclosure, including social inclusion                                                             \nemployees with disabilities, workplace culture and an                                                                          \nemployer’s perceived commitment to disability                                                                                   \ninclusion. 7   See Appendices B and C for further details                                                                                   \non employee’s with disabilities workplace                                                                                                                       \nperceptions around disclosure.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n2 Inclusion of People with Disabilities in the Workplace \n12/15/2016 \nNishi, L., & Bruyère, S. (2014)8 \n \nManager’s Role  \nOne of the most important factors in determining whether or not to disclose a disability is \nsupport from the employee’s manager or supervisor. In fact, most people disclose to their \nmanager, therefore it is imperative for managers to \nbe trained in disability issues.1,8 General disability \nawareness training helps to decrease stereotypes and \njudgements about individuals with disabilities, and \ncan also offer concrete suggestions for interacting \nwith people with disabilities.7 While employers should \ntrain both supervisors and employees more generally \nabout disability, managers should also know about \nthe personal and possible legal consequences of \ntreating people with disabilities as less valued \nmembers of a workplace.7 \nInternal Policy Initiatives  \nA disability-inclusive culture often will provide positive results for overall employee satisfaction \nand productivity among workers with and without disabilities. Here are some practical \nconsiderations for HR leaders in looking at your own policies and practices.9 \n• Make concerted efforts to increase the number of individuals with \ndisabilities employed in all positions—professional, administrative, \ntechnical, clerical, and other categories.10\n• Promote well-qualified and high performing individuals with disabilities \ninto leadership roles across the business.9\nStaffing\n• People with disabilities feel more comfortable asking for \naccommodations when a climate is perceived as inclusive.5\n• 50% of workplace accommodations cost less than $50 and the majority \n(88 %) cost less than $1,000.2 A central fund means a manager doesn't \nhave to make an accommodation decision based on their own bottom \nline.10\n• Accommodations can benefit everyone. Establish a universal policy fot \nworkplace flexibility all employees, with and without disabilities, \nincluding telework options, if appropriate. 10, 11\nAccommodations\n  \n3 Inclusion of People with Disabilities in the Workplace \n12/15/2016 \nOn-Going Evaluation10 \nAs with any HR initiative, evaluation is needed to ensure programs are making an impact. \nEmployment-Related Activities \n• Job posting, recruitment, advertising, and job \napplication procedures, including testing \n• Hiring, promotion, upgrading, \nawards of tenure, and layoffs \n• Rates of pay and any other \nforms of compensation, \nincluding fringe benefits \n• Job assignments, job \nclassifications, job \ndescriptions, and \nseniority lists \n• Sick leave, leaves of absence, \nand other leave \n• Training, apprenticeships, attendance at \nprofessional meetings and conferences \nSelf-Assessment Data Points \n• Information related to the provision of reasonable \naccommodations that could be used to assess the \neffectiveness of accommodations and the process \n• Data relating to the representation of individuals with disabilities \nin the workforce to ascertain trends, including the efficacy of recruitment, hiring, \nretention, and promotion initiatives \n• Complaint tracking and monitoring system to identify areas needing systemic \nimprovements. \nSeek input from \nemployees with \ndisabilities regarding \nimplementation of \npolicies\nSelf-\nassessments \nincluding \nidentifying \ntrends or \nissues\n• Universal design - structures, spaces, services, communications and \nresources that are accessible to a range of people with and without \ndisabilities, without further need for modification or accommodation.11\n• How do I implement universal design in my organization?\n• Provide manuals, materials and forms to all employees in a variety of \ndigital formats that are accessible to people who use adaptive \ncomputer technologies. Don't forget applicants!10\n• Build workspaces accessible to people who use wheelchairs or other \nsimilar equipment.11\n• Make sure any events held outside of work are accessible.10\nAccessibility\n  \n4 Inclusion of People with Disabilities in the Workplace \n12/15/2016 \nCargill\nPartnership with the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science to source interns with \ndisabilities in science, engineering, mathematics, \ncomputer sciences, and business. \nCollaboration with Career Opportunities for \nStudents with Disabilities to learn how to more \neffectively prepare students with disabilities for \nrecruitment. \nMerck’s Employee Resource Group, Merck Allies \nfor Disabilities (MAD), sponsors Disability \nMentoring Day to promote career development for \nstudents and job seekers with disabilities through \njob shadowing and career exploration. \nHR works with employees to develop a customized \naction plan that is in place prior to the employee’s \nfirst day of work. The plan is updated throughout \nthe employee’s career with Merck. \nMerck provides training resources to build \nawareness and help employees work more \neffectively with colleagues who have disabilities. \nThrough the Employee Resource Group, MAD, \nMerck sponsors leadership development and \nnetworking sessions for employees with \ndisabilities. \ney\nProvides accommodations for people with \ndisabilities in their own offices, at off-site \nmeetings, and in the client locations where they \nfrequently work. \nMaking internal communications, meetings, \ntraining, and tools accessible and easy to use. \nBuilding an accessibility strategy for all web-based \nand online applications. \nLeveraging assistive technologies for easier \ncomputer and communications use by people with \ndisabilities. \nEducating all employees on disabilities etiquette, \nlanguage, and work habits. \nRaising awareness of hidden disabilities and how \nto support people working with chronic health \nconditions, serious illnesses, mental health issues, \nnonvisible, and temporary disabilities. \nBest Practices from Companies like Yours12 \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n5 Inclusion of People with Disabilities in the Workplace \n12/15/2016 \nThe Bottom Line \nResearch shows that inclusive workplaces don’t just make employees happier and create \npositive feelings. Inclusive environment produce business outcomes including: \n• Reduced expenses corresponding to reduced employee turn-over  \n• Increased worker commitment to and identification with organizational success \n• Improved productivity  \n• Increased employee investment in work performance9 \nWhen employees feel confident and comfortable at work, everyone benefits.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n6 Inclusion of People with Disabilities in the Workplace \n12/15/2016 \nReferences  \n1.
