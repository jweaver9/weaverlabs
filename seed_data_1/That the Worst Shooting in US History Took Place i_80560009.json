Linger / History News NetworkJun 13,2016 0This post is in partnership with the History News Network, the website that puts the newsinto historical perspective. The article below was onginally published at HNN.The selection of Pulse, a gay Orlando nightclub, as the site for a murderous homophobicrampage makes the killer's crime a special outrage in view of the role that nightclubs haveplayed in this nation's LGBTQ history.Like many popular LGTBQ clubs, Pulse serves not only as a welcoming place to party, butalso as a community partner, hosting a variety of social and educational events including,http://time.com/4367475/gay-bar-history-pulse-orlando/ 1/35/2/2017 Pulse Orlando and the History of the American Gay Bar |Time.comfor example, Breast Cancer Awareness and HIV/AIDS prevention. According to its website,Pulse Orlando serves as \"a driving force within the GLBT community\" and strives to \"tomake strides towards equality awareness, and love for all.\"Nightclubs have been some of the most potent sites of identity, organization, and power inthe long history of LGBTQ Americans.In the South, during the many decades of Jim Crow racial segregation, ramshackle jookjoints and barrel houses tucked away in rural areas allowed African Americans to dance,drink, and socialize away from the eyes and ears of whites—and disapproving members ofthe black church. These informal nightclubs were sites of great sexual freedom. Some ofthe African American blues singers who performed were openly lesbian and their songscelebrated sex between women.Far better known are the bohemian clubs of the early modern cities. Beginning in the late1800s, these bars and restaurants offered people a (relatively) safe space to behave in wayscounter to society's standards of propriety. They were frequented not just by gay men andlesbians, but also by artists, musicians, theater people, and other non-traditionalistsconsidered to be operating beyond the bounds of respectable society.As early as the turn of the last century, bars and clubs catering exclusively to homosexualswere cropping up in virtually every major American city. Patrons discovered a place to findothers like themselves, where they did not have to pass as straight, and where they couldrelax and have some fun.Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletterThese establishments were a very rare site for possibilities of gay or lesbian community.They could be a pick up spot, and also a haven, a sanctuary, and a place to strategize in thefight for legal and social acceptance. At the same time, they represented very real danger.There were many ways in which being arrested in a raid on a gay bar—and having thatarrest reported in the press—could ruin a person's life. For closeted individuals who weremarried, such exposure could provide the grounds for divorce and result in the loss of allrights to their children. Unmarried patrons also had a lot at stake. For all who frequentedgay or lesbian bars, news of being arrested in a raid could lead to fines, imprisonment, orcommitment to mental institutions as well as the loss of jobs, apartments, friends, andfamily.http://time.com/4367475/gay-bar-history-pulse-orlando/ 2/35/2/2017 PulseOrlandoandtheHistory of Ihe American Gay Bar |Time.comDespite these risks, bars and clubs catering to LGBTQ patrons continued to proliferate andto serve as sites of community and acceptance not to be found in most families, churches,or organizing halls. The irony that entering such a sanctum increased the likelihood oftheir arrest was not lost on the bars' clientele. It is not surprising that one of the firstrecorded transgender riots occurred in Compton's Cafeteria in San Francisco in 1966 after apolice crackdown on the late night eatery, one of the few venues where transgender people(unwelcome in gay bars) could congregate.Three years later the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village, NewYork, also fought back during a police raid. This event, widely considered to be the startingpoint for the modern day for LGBTQ rights movement, is commemorated every June inPride parades throughout the United States and around the world.Gay clubs and bars hold a special place in history as havens and sanctuaries as well asparty-spots and hook-up sites. They've served as venues in which to build solidarity andcommunity, and to promote education. They've also been the sites of violence andpersecution that, in the past, ultimately led to great advancements in pride, rights, andfreedoms.The fact that the worst mass shooting in American history took place in a gay bar is anespecially grievous insult in view of the role that gay bars in general, and Pulse inparticular, play in fostering identity and promoting community. As LGBTQ people and theirallies prepare for Pride celebrations later this month, honor should be paid not only thosewho lost their lives, but also to the unique places and spaces that will continue to foster gaypride, facilitate progress, and promote feelings of belonging, solidarity, and joy.Nancy C.
