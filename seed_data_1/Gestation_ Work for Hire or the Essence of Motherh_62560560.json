INTRODUCTIONMotherhood is no longer a simple concept. Black’s Law Dictionary defines“mother” as “a woman who has given birth to or legally adopted a child.”1 Re-cent advances in reproductive technologies have called into question this basicdefinition of motherhood. Through in vitro fertilization, it is possible to extractan egg from one woman and implant the fertilized egg into the uterus of anotherwoman, thereby severing the genetic and gestational aspects of motherhood.Depending on the identity of the intended mother, this process is known eitheras gestational or full surrogacy (if the egg donor is the intended mother and thebirth mother is acting as a surrogate) or egg donation (if the birth mother is theintended mother and another woman acted as an egg donor).2 The legal motherin gestational surrogate motherhood could be the egg donor, the intendedmother, the birth mother or some combination thereof. In U.S. case law,“mother” has been defined in a variety of ways, including the woman who do-nates an ovum and the woman who intends to be the mother of a new born.3U.S. courts have held that whatever motherhood is, the Black’s Law definition ofgiving birth to a child is not necessarily definitive.4Copyright © 2002 by Pamela Laufer-Ukeles.* Associate, Debevoise & Plimpton.

BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1031 (7th ed. 1999).2. Traditional or partial surrogacy necessitates only artificial insemination; the birth mother isalso the egg donor and is therefore the genetic mother. In vitro fertilization allows for the division ofthe normal process of childbirth; one woman the donator of the child’s genes and the other womancarries and gives birth to the child. This division happens in two contexts. The first is in egg dona-tion, where a woman who cannot produce a fertile egg uses another woman’s egg, which is then in-seminated with her husband’s sperm. The second is gestational surrogacy where a woman whocannot carry a pregnancy to term hires or recruits another woman to carry the child for her.3.

The argument for autonomyand choice, strongly advocated by Dr. Carmel Shalev, maintains that womenhave a right to sell gestational services along with the sale of their ova and to re-ceive payment for using their wombs. She argues that to deny women the rightto do so based on concerns for their ability to consent to such a contract is patri-archal in that it questions a women’s ability to make valid contracts and mini-mizes their full autonomy.6 This argument favors choice and intention as thedetermining factors in deciding legal motherhood. On the other end of thespectrum is the argument for protection of women from financial exploitationand the imperative to keep certain body parts or biological acts sacred, similar tothe prohibition on prostitution.7 This point of view favors using gestation orparturition as the definition of motherhood, thereby making surrogacy ar-rangements less palatable since the birth mother will always be considered thelegal mother.The act of defining motherhood also involves a value judgment that affectsthe use of reproductive technologies.8 Allowing a woman’s or a couple’s inten-5. The case of In re Baby M received much public attention from reporters as well as scholars.See, e.g., Avi Katz, Surrogate Motherhood and Baby-Selling Laws, 20 COLUM. J. L. & SOC.

Dolgin, Status andContract In Feminist Legal Theory of the Family, 12 WOMEN’S RTS. L. REP. 103, 104-08 (1990) (arguingthat family law should be based on contract principles).7. See Ruth Macklin, Is There Anything Wrong with Surrogate Motherhood? An Ethical Analysis, 16L. MED. & HEALTH CARE 57, 62 (1988) (arguing against enforcement of surrogacy agreements be-cause they are exploitive of poor women); Janice Raymond, Reproductive Gifts and Gift Giving: TheAltruistic Woman, HASTINGS CTR. REP., Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 11 (arguing that even altruistic surrogacy isexploitive, in that it sets women apart as the caregiver and the breeder class).8. The underlying ethical complexity of defining motherhood stems from an attack on the con-cept of “natural” motherhood by the advent of modern technology. See Janet L. Dolgin, Just a Gene:Judicial Assumptions about Parenthood, 40 UCLA L. REV. 637, 673 (1993).There have been four basic approaches used to determine motherhood in the absence of a clearnatural definition. Some writers advocate contract principles which privilege the intended motheras the legal mother according to the dictates of an agreement or consent form from the egg donor.See John Lawrence Hill, What Does It Mean to Be a “Parent”? The Claims of Biology as the Basis for Paren-tal Rights, 66 N.Y.U. L. REV. 353, 419 (1991) (concluding that contractual intent provides a rule ofcertainty in favor of the “prime movers” of the child’s conception); Richard A. Posner, The Regulationof the Market in Adoptions, 67 B.U. L. REV. 59, 72 (1987) (arguing for a free market in babies and repro-ductive services); Marjorie Maguire Schultz, Reproductive Technology and Intent-Based Parenthood: AnOpportunity for Gender Neutrality, 1990 WIS. L. REV. 297, 397-98 (reasoning that contract principlesfurther the gender-neutral goals of intention and choice in reproductive decisions).Others argue that the genetic mother should be considered the legal mother because the geneticcontribution is the most significant. See, e.g., Ruth Macklin, Artificial Means of Reproduction and OurUnderstanding of the Family, HASTINGS CTR. REP., Jan.-Feb., 1991, at 5 (considering the various meth-ods, including genetics, to determine the actual mother); Suzanne F. Seavello, Are You My Mother? ALAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 93tion to determine legal parenthood in reproductive technology situations pro-motes the use of these technologies. Those who believe that intention and ge-netics are the significant factors in determining motherhood tend to promote theuse of gestational surrogate motherhood.9 If it is determined that the genetic orintended mother is the legal mother, such contracts would not be controversialbecause the contract would provide for the mother who is thereby defined as thenatural or legal mother to be given custody. Thus, such definitions avoid at-tacks of baby-selling and exploitation of women and their babies.On the other hand, those who believe that gestational surrogates should bedeemed the legal mothers generally do not distinguish between traditional sur-rogate motherhood and gestational surrogacy, and tend to oppose both.10 De-spite the popularity of traditional surrogate motherhood contracts, when courtsare faced with opposing claims of the surrogate and intended mothers to thechild, they have deemed traditional surrogate motherhood agreements unen-forceable and against public policy because they are seen as a form of baby sell-ing.11 If gestation is considered the basis of legal motherhood, similar problemswould arise in gestational surrogacy, as the legal (natural) mother would becontracting to give up her own child. Preserving biology and gestation as de-termining factors that cannot be altered through intent alone makes the use ofthese technologies more complex. Preserving the natural status of the gesta-tional mother despite a contract that provides otherwise throws uncertainty overthe whole process by allowing the surrogate mother to withdraw from the con-tract or protest.In contrast to these logically polar viewpoints, Jewish law is in the un-wieldy position of having legal precedent that weighs in favor of holding thatthe gestational surrogate is the legal mother, and simultaneously supporting theJudge’s Decision in In Vitro Fertilization Surrogacy, 3 HASTINGS WOMEN’S L.J. 211, 211-24 (1992) (argu-ing for a genetics based determination);Still others clam that gestation is the most significant element of motherhood. See, e.g., SCOTT B.RAE, THE ETHICS OF SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD, BRAVE NEW FAMILIES? (1994) (arguing that thewoman who gives birth to the child should be considered the legal mother of the child); BARBARAKATZ ROTHMAN, RECREATING MOTHERHOOD: IDEOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY IN A PATRIARCHALSOCIETY (1989) (arguing that the essential maternal tie is based on carrying the child in pregnancy).Others rely upon a “best interests of the child” standard for their final determination of whichwoman is the mother. See MARTHA A. FIELD, SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD 126-60, 151-52 (1988) (ar-guing for a best interest test with a presumption of maternal custody in traditional surrogacy). An-other original suggestion that has been made is for both women to be considered as the “mother” ofthe child and for a kinship relationship to ensue. See Randy Frances Kandel, Which Came First: TheMother or the Egg? A Kinship Solution to Gestational Surrogacy 47 RUTGERS L. REV. 165, 168, 221-22(1994) (arguing for multiple mothers from the perspective of a kinship relationship).9. For commentators who have argued for the standard of intent and who also support surro-gate motherhood, see generally Posner, supra note 8; Hill, supra note 8; Schultz, supra note 8.10. See, e.g., RAE, supra note 8, at 77-116 (arguing that the woman who gives birth to the childshould be considered the legal mother of the child and opposing commercial surrogate mother-hood); ROTHMAN, supra note 8, at 229-46 (arguing that pregnancy and interpersonal relationshipsdetermine a woman’s fitness to parent and not genetic ties or intent).11. See infra notes 36-37 and accompanying text. Egg donations present fewer problems be-cause an egg donor contributes her eggs and immediately waives all rights to the child. The dona-tion is often anonymous, but even if it is not, the egg donor has much less of a physiological connec-tion with the child.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PM94 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 9:91 2002usage of reproductive technologies in order to promote the important goal ofreproduction.12 Motherhood in Jewish law is rigidly defined and derived fromprecedent and through the use of analogy. The traditional and morally norma-tive perspective of Jewish law necessitates an analysis of the surrogate mothers’status without subverting this concern to overriding consequentialist opinionsas to whether or not surrogate motherhood should be permissible. Therefore,Jewish law provides a forum for analyzing the definition of motherhood in iso-lation from the larger issue of the permissibility of surrogate motherhood.The U.S. has ultimately placed an overwhelming emphasis on the impor-tance of genetics and intention in defining motherhood in gestational surrogacy,and has largely supported gestational surrogate contracts.13 On the other hand,Jewish law, for the most part, has endorsed the criteria of birth as the definingfactor of motherhood.14 However, Jewish law’s emphasis on biology and genderdifference that lead to identifying the birth mother as the legal mother has notprevented a number of prominent Jewish law authorities from condoning ges-tational surrogate motherhood agreements. The result is that whether themother is originally defined as the intended mother, as she is in U.S. law, orwhether the surrogate is defined as the legal mother, as she is in Jewish law, le-gal systems find a means of permitting the use of surrogate motherhood. Thetwo systems of law are striking in their distinctive analyses of gestational surro-gate motherhood, yet they are also striking in the similarity of their conclusions.Both of these legal systems subjugate the rights of the surrogate mother andare paternalistic. Allowing gestational surrogate motherhood, without provi-sions for the protection of the surrogate, leads to sublimating the woman’s rightsfor the sake of the biological father and his wife. The purpose of this paper is toshow how two different legal approaches to surrogate motherhood, with differ-ent premises and, most importantly, two different ways of defining mother-hood, each ignore the rights of the surrogate mothers because of patriarchal con-siderations.U.S. law fails to take any account of gender differences or the importance ofgestation in a woman’s experience of motherhood, and uses the concept of“natural” blithely in order to facilitate the use of surrogate motherhood. ThusU.S. law uses male standards of judgment as to what constitutes parenthoodand ignores that which is unique about motherhood. Alternately, Jewish law,while recognizing the surrogate mother as the natural mother, ultimately sub-sumes her rights for the sake of procreation and the importance of fatherhood.By means of contrast and comparison of U.S. law and Jewish law, this arti-cle will uncover those principles of each legal system that lead to their disregard12. For the purposes of this article, Jewish law refers to that law which finds its source in TheBible and The Talmud. See infra note 102 for a more complete explanation of Jewish law and itssources. This use of Jewish law is meant to be non-sectarian and applicable to all denominations ofJudaism. However, this article does not use response from Conservative or Reformed Rabbis; ratherthe usage of Jewish law is most reflective of Orthodox Judaism. For a summary of opinions that ex-plain Jewish law’s support of reproductive technologies see David J. Bleich, In Vitro Fertilization:Questions of Maternal Identity and Conversion, in JEWISH LAW AND THE NEW REPRODUCTIVETECHNOLOGIES 46 (Emanuel Feldman & Joel Wolowelsky eds., 1997).13. See infra Part II(B).14. See infra Part II(C).LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 95of the gestational surrogate’s rights. The flow of the argument will center onJewish law and will simultaneously compare and contrast U.S. law. Since sur-rogate motherhood agreements entail varied arrangements, the comparativeanalysis will be carried out through a focus on the Israeli Surrogate AgreementsLaw,15 which is substantially identical or comparable to a number of U.S. Statelaws.16Part II will focus on different legal approaches to defining motherhood inthe context of surrogate motherhood. The Israeli, American and Jewish lawprecedent on legal motherhood in gestational surrogacy will be examined.Based on the majority decision of Jewish authorities as to the identity of thegestational mother as the legal mother, Part III discusses the feasibility of en-forcing surrogacy contracts under Jewish law in comparison to the factors dic-tating whether these contracts are enforced or not enforced in the U.S. Part IVdiscusses other legal principles that may influence the permissibility of gesta-tional surrogacy agreements, despite the problems with promoting such con-tracts uncovered in the previous sections: the imperative to procreate, adoptionand custody. Finally, Part V will explain how both systems are ultimately patri-archal and subjugate the rights of the gestational surrogate in favor of the rightsof the intended parents due to male-based standards and interests.II. THE DEFINITION OF MOTHERHOODA. The Israel Surrogate Motherhood Agreements LawThe Israeli Surrogate Motherhood Agreements Law (“Surrogate Agree-ments Law”) was enacted after recommendations were offered by the AloniCommission, set up to discuss the ethical, legal and religious implications of re-productive technologies, including surrogate motherhood.17 With the passing of15. Surrogate Motherhood Agreements Law, 1996, S.H. 1577 [hereinafter Surrogate AgreementsLaw].16. FLA. STAT. ANN. § 742.15 (West 1997) is the only statute that, by its implication, is identicalto that of Israel by condoning commercial gestational surrogate motherhood and not traditional sur-rogate motherhood. Other statutes exist in certain jurisdictions of the U.S. that regulate surrogatemotherhood, but no other law besides the Florida statute and Israeli law go so far as to facilitate thetransfer of children born of gestational surrogate motherhood agreements for consideration to theintended mothers. See infra notes 76-94 and accompanying text (for a discussion of U.S. statutes thatregulate surrogate motherhood).17. Prior to the passing of the law, a commission headed by former Judge Shaul Aloni, wascalled to evaluate the social, ethical, halakhic (Jewish law) and legal aspects of the methods of treat-ment related to in vitro fertilization, including the possibility of surrogate motherhood contracts. SeeISRAEL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, THE REPORT OF THE PUBLIC-PROFESSIONAL COMMISSION IN THE MATTEROF IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (1994)[hereinafter ALONI COMMISSION REPORT]. The committee wasgathered shortly after a court case called on the High Court of Justice to direct the Minister of Healthto explain why regulations had been drawn by the Ministry that prevented them for engaging a sur-rogate mother in Israel. H.C. 1237/91, Nachmani v. Minister of Health (unpublished). The regula-tions referred to are the Public Health Regulations on IVF (In Vitro Fertilization), 1987, K.T. 5035,978, which outlawed surrogate motherhood agreements by stating that “[a]n ovum will not betransplanted unless it is into the womb of the woman who will be the child’s mother.” Ultimately,the majority of the Commission proposed to allow surrogate motherhood agreements on the condi-tion that they receive prior approval, before conception, from a statutory committee with otherLAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PM96 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 9:91 2002the Surrogate Motherhood Agreements Law in 1996, Israel became a pioneer inregulating and facilitating commercial surrogacy agreements. Since the passingof the law, there have been more than 12 children born to surrogate mothers inaccordance with surrogacy contracts pre-approved by a committee as mandatedby the law. The first birth took place in February 1998, with the first surrogatetwins born in Israel and the use of the surrogacy contracts is growing more andmore common.18The Surrogate Agreements Law allows only for gestational surrogate ar-rangements, thereby implicitly forbidding traditional surrogacy.19 Traditionalsurrogacy is usually accomplished through artificial insemination, while gesta-tional surrogacy necessitates in vitro fertilization, a more complicated procedurefor the surrogate mother.20 In addition, according to the Surrogate AgreementsLaw, the sperm must be from the intended father.21The Surrogate Agreements Law does not give any legal status to the birthmother upon the child’s birth. Legal parenthood is delegated to the intendedparents almost immediately.22 The Surrogate Motherhood Agreements Lawstates, “The child shall, from its birth, be in the custody of the intended parents,and they shall bear toward it all the responsibilities and obligations of a parentto his child.”23 Delivery of the child by the birth mother into the custody of theintended parents must be in the presence of a Welfare Officer and must be car-ried out as soon as possible after the birth of the child.24 Within seven days ofthe child’s birth, the intended parents must apply for a parentage order.25 Theparentage order is given to the intended parents by the court automatically, un-less, after having received a report from the Welfare Officer, the court deter-mines that doing so would endanger the child’s welfare.26 The intended parentsare the “default” parents and, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,they will be given custody of the child upon its birth and full rights of parentageshortly thereafter.The legal status of the intended parents is buttressed by the surrogatemother’s lack of a right to withdraw from the agreement.27 The law states thatspecified limitations. The two members in the minority did not disagree with the principle of regu-lating surrogacy and ultimately allowing it, but with the details of the regulatory scheme. The AloniCommission’s recommendations were accepted in part and partially modified in the SurrogateAgreements Law. See Rhona Schuz, The Right to Parenthood: Surrogacy and Frozen Embryos, in THEINTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF FAMILY LAW 237 (Andrew Bainham ed., 1996).18. See Allison Kaplan Sommer, Labor Pains, THE JERUSALEM POST, Jan. 7, 2000, at 14-17.19. Surrogate Agreements Law, supra note 15, § 2(4).20. For a full explanation of gestational and traditional surrogacy, see In re Marriage of Mos-chetta, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 893 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994); Michael Korinaldi, The Legal Status of a Child Born ofArtificial Insemination from a Donor or from an Egg Donor, 18 SHNATON HAMISHPAT HAIVRI 64-65(1995).21.

The law assumes that these rights never existed, andrequires only a parentage order. When a parentage order is made, “the in-tended parents shall be the parents and sole guardians of the child, and it shallbe their child for all intents and purposes.”31 Even stronger language was usedin the Aloni Commission’s recommendations on the matter of surrogate moth-erhood, “With the transfer of the child from the surrogate mother to the in-tended parents, in the presence of a Welfare Officer, they [the intended parents]will be considered the parents of the child, and the child will be considered thenatural child for all purposes.”32The Israeli law is an ideal point of comparison because it is one of the firstto actively facilitate such surrogate motherhood agreements. In addition, thereis significant discourse between Jewish and Israeli law making it possible to ex-amine opinions by Jewish law authorities on Israeli law, which permits onlygestational surrogate motherhood. Such direct opinions will allow for definitiverather than speculative judgments as to what Jewish law holds with regards tovarious provisions of surrogate motherhood. While issues of medical treatmentdiscussed in this paper are not under the jurisdiction of Jewish law in Israel, inmatters affecting ability to marry and legitimacy of children, Jewish law (“halak-hic”) considerations may affect the civil law determination.33 Furthermore, the28.

Israel has a chief Rabbinate and is self-identified as a Jewish state. Although Jewish lawdoes not govern, Jewish religious leaders have considerable influence on Israeli law and often passjudgment on Israeli laws. Israeli law is influenced by Jewish law in a number of ways—by use ofJewish law in judicial determinations and interpretations of Israeli laws, and incorporation of Jewishlaw into Israeli legislation and statutes by reference.The Israeli legal system is comprised of a number of different components. Much of the law is acodification of English common law that was instituted before the establishment of the State. Until1980, English common law was considered binding on the law of Israel, where relevant. The Foun-dations of Law Act effectively and formally dislodged Israeli law from English law and determinedthat, “Where the court finds that a legal issue requiring decision cannot be resolved by reference toLAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PM98 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 9:91 2002Israeli law epitomizes the movement promoting progressive pro-reproductivetechnologies and reproductive freedom that will continue to challenge us as sci-ence progresses.34B. United States Law1. Case LawIn the limited circumstances in which U.S. Courts have been asked to de-termine their permissibility, they have held that traditional surrogate mother-hood contracts are either invalid, unenforceable or at least voidable.35legislation or judicial precedent, or my means of analogy, it shall reach its decision in the light of theprinciples of freedom, justice equity and peace of the Jewish heritage.” See The Foundations of LawAct, 1980, 34 L.S.I. 181 (1979-80). Simultaneously, Article 46 of the Palestine Order in Council andSaving Clause, which implemented the system of British law was repealed. Thereafter, English andAmerican law, as well as Jewish law, are used to analyze issues not yet dealt with in Israeli law, eventhough Israeli law is an independent system.There are essentially two other ways that Jewish law is incorporated into Israeli law: by referenceand directly. See generally, Itzchak Englard, The Place of Religious Law in the Israel Legal System, 2MISHPATIM 268, 291 (1970); Brayahu Lifshitz, Israeli Law and Jewish Law—Interaction and Independence,24 ISRAEL L. REV. 507 (1990). Under the Rabbinical Court Law, Rabbinical courts are given exclusiveauthority in “matters of marriage and divorce of Jews.” See Rabbinical Court Jurisdiction (Marriageand Divorce) Law, 1953, 7 L.S.I. 139 (1953) [hereinafter Rabbinical Court Law]. Accordingly, there isno civil marriage or divorce in Israel. Besides having exclusive jurisdiction over matters of personalstatus, the rabbinical courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the request of the wife in maintenanceclaims that are not part of a divorce settlement. Id. Questions of paternity, however, have been heldnot to be under concurrent jurisdiction. See H.C. 283/72, Buaron v. The Rabbinical Tribunal, 197226(2) P.D. 727.Another area of interaction between Jewish law and Israeli law is through direct incorporation.Direct incorporation occurs when the legislator adopts canons of Jewish law into the civil law codeas original Israeli legislation. See Lifshitz, this note, at 512-23. The Israeli legislator makes no specificreference to the rules of Jewish law but incorporates Jewish law principles. There is no doubt thatJewish law has substantially influenced Israeli statutory law. See, e.g., N. RAKOVER, JEWISH LAW INTHE LEGISLATION OF THE KNESSET (1989) (providing a comprehensive listing and discussion of Israelilaws that have been influenced by Jewish law considerations).Furthermore, under the Rabbinical Court Law, Rabbinical courts are given exclusive authority in“matters of marriage and divorce of Jews.” See Rabbinical Court Law, 7 L.S.I. 139, (1953). Accord-ingly, there is no civil marriage or divorce in Israel.34. See, e.g., Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, Redefining Parenthood, 29 CAL. W.

Surr. Ct. 1986) (holding that the agreements were not per se voidbut were voidable depending on the circumstances of the case).LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 99In the widely publicized case of In re Baby M,36 the Supreme Court of NewJersey based its opinion on the unlawfulness of prenatal adoption. In order toterminate parental rights in private placement adoptions, the court must find an“intentional abandonment or a very substantial neglect of the parental dutieswithout a reasonable expectation of a reversal of that conduct in the future.”37Private prenatal agreements are not enforceable unless the birth mother inten-tionally abandons her child after birth. Therefore, the surrogacy arrangement,which committed the surrogate mother to surrender her parental rights beforeshe gave birth, was deemed illegal and unenforceable. In addition, the courtheld that the contract violated societal norms against baby selling and wasthereby against public policy.38In two cases that discuss uncontested parentage orders as opposed to dis-puted custody, courts have held that the surrogacy arrangement should not beconsidered a void prenatal adoption but rather a prenatal custody arrangementbetween two parents.39 However, both cases reserved the possibility that thecontracts would be voidable in a contested case where there was undue influ-ence, fraud, or excessive payments.40 These cases are examples of voluntary re-linquishment of the child after the child’s birth, and are therefore not at oddswith adoption procedures since the birth mother consents to transfer.On the other hand, the courts discussing the issue of gestational surrogacyin the U.S. have consistently held that the intended mother is the legal mother.However, the opinions are divided as to whether the determining factor shouldbe intent or genetics.In Anna J. v. Mark C.,41 Mrs. Calvert’s ovum was fertilized with the sperm ofher husband using in vitro fertilization.42 The fertilized ovum was then im-planted into the uterus of Ms. Johnson, the surrogate mother, pursuant to a sur-rogacy contract in which Ms. Johnson agreed to relinquish “all parental rights”to the child in favor of the Calverts, who were to take the baby into their home“as their child.”43 After the birth, Ms. Johnson refused to relinquish the child tothe intended parents and sought custody of the child.44 The trial court, in abench ruling, held that the Calverts were the natural parents because they werethe genetic parents.45 The trial court emphasized that the case was not compara-ble to traditional surrogacy, but rather, characterized Ms. Johnson as more of acaretaker, similar to a babysitter, wet nurse, or temporary foster mother.46 The36.

Can the natural mother simply be themother who has the proper intent, or is the natural mother a term denotingsomething pre-contractual?56 Professor Kandel explains that even in the legalsphere a difference does exist between a contractual and natural mother,The status of natural parent may constrain and limit contracts concerning chil-dren, such as child support, but even when a woman relinquishes her childthrough adoption, or loses it to the state as a consequence of her delinquent be-havior, her status as a natural parent does not change. Contract, however, canalter parental rights and obligations, including the child’s custody, as frequentlyevidenced in divorce and separation agreements.5747. Anna J., 286 Cal. Rptr. at 382.48. Cal.

Clark, the Ohio Supreme Court faced a similartask of determining who is the legal mother in gestational surrogate mother-hood.62 One month prior to her marriage to Anthony Belsito, Ms. Belsito had toundergo a hysterectomy due to a bout with cervical cancer, resulting in her in-ability to carry children.63 The doctors were able to preserve her ovaries so thatshe would be able to produce eggs. Carol Clark, Ms. Belsito’s younger sister,agreed to carry Ms. Belsito’s egg fertilized with Anthony’s sperm through in vi-tro fertilization. According to Ohio law, upon its birth, the child was to be reg-istered as the child of Carol Clark, the surrogate mother.64 Therefore, the Belsi-tos filed a complaint for declaratory judgment stating that it is unnecessary forthem to adopt the child now carried by Carol Clark and that they should belisted as the birth parents on the birth certificate.65The court decided to grant the declaratory judgment in favor of the Belsi-tos. In his majority opinion, Judge Spicer stated that, “a review of case law leadsto the conclusion that the term “natural parent” refers to the child and parentbeing of the same blood or related by blood.66 Furthermore, he determined thatin modern terminology, blood relationship is the equivalent to genetics.67 He ar-gued that the Uniform Parentage Act of Ohio, which holds that either birth orDNA tests can determine the mother, has caused confusion in the case of surro-58.

Unlike in traditional surrogacy cases where the host mother who isalso the genetic mother and the surrogate is generally deemed to be the naturalmother, gestational cases focus on the assignment of the status of the “natural”mother. Thus, an obvious focus underlying such decisions is genetic make-upsince only the fact that the intended mother is the egg donor distinguishes tra-ditional surrogacy from gestational surrogacy.2. U.S. StatutesThe federal government of the United States has not regulated the enforce-ability of surrogate motherhood contracts. A number of states have left the issueof surrogacy contracts to the judicial system, thereby dealing with the issue defacto. The majority of states have adopted the Uniform Parentage Act (“UPA”),and applied the act to traditional surrogacy contracts.74 Under the UPA, a parentcan be established by either proving a genetic relationship or by the womanbearing and delivering the child.75 Applying the UPA to a traditional surrogacysituation, the surrogate and the semen provider are the child’s mother and fa-ther. However, in the gestational surrogacy context, as discussed above, both68. Id. at 764. Furthermore, he states, “ . . . [S]ociety and the law recognize only one naturalmother.” Id.

The District of Columbia,82 Indiana,83 Michigan,84 New York,85North Dakota,86 and Utah87 deny enforcement of all surrogacy contracts.

New Hampshire makes non-commercial surrogacyagreements enforceable but grants the surrogate mother the right to terminatethe agreement, unconditionally, 72 hours after the birth of the child.92 Accordingto the statute, after approval of a judicial hearing, the rights of the birth motherand her husband are terminated. Arkansas is the only state that has passed leg-islation providing an unconditional presumption of validity of traditional sur-rogacy arrangements commercial and non-commercial.

Jewish LawJewish legal authorities have approached this inquiry with seriousnessequal to the U.S. courts and legislators, but with a significantly different empha-sis. The court’s solution in Johnson v. Calvert to the maternity question of gesta-tional surrogacy, based upon the intent of the parties, has not been discussed inJewish legal sources. Dr. Chaim Povarsky comments, “The notion of establish-ing a parent-child relationship based upon the intent of the parties who are in-volved in the production of the child is alien to Jewish thought.”95 This is be-cause, as will be discussed in the following section, Jewish law does nottraditionally recognize the establishment of parental status by intent in anyform, even by adoption or when all parties agree.96 Intention is foreign to Jewishlaw as a basis for determining natural relationships such as motherhood.Another distinction between the methodology of U.S. law and Jewish law isthat secular law is mainly concerned with the custody of the child and the rightsof the surrogate mother and the intended parents to the child, whereas Jewishlaw is mostly concerned with the status of the child established by the identityof its mother.97 Jewish law authorities who have commented on the identity ofthe mother, have done so with an emphasis on determining the child’s lineage,not the child’s care.98In Jewish law, regardless of who cares for the child, lineage has significantconsequences. The establishment of parenthood relates to the fulfillment ofhalakhic obligations, issues of personal status and civil law.99 With regard to re-ligious obligations, the issue of parentage is relevant for matters of the father’sobligation to “be fruitful and multiply,”100 and the obligation of the child tohonor its parents. The personal status of the child is relevant for determiningthe permissibility of certain marriages, i.e., laws against incest. In matters ofcivil law, parental status may be relevant for matters of inheritance and childmaintenance laws. Therefore, the importance of determining motherhood isbroader than the issue of who will be entitled to custody.93. ARK. CODE ANN. § 9-10-201 (Michie 1998).94. Id. § 9-10-201 (2).95.

Rather, modern day poskim (religious authorities) have issued re-sponsa (answers to individual questions)103 and Jewish law commentators haveissued opinions on the matter based on Talmudic sources.104 When an issue isnot directly discussed either in The Torah or The Talmud, authorities will basetheir opinions on analogies with accepted rulings, derive law from Talmudic orbiblical sources, or when this is not possible, they may base their opinions on ag-gadah—the homiletic, non-normative portion of The Talmud, also known as thephilosophy of the law.105Jewish legal authorities disagree as to whether the genetic donor or gesta-tional surrogate is the actual mother. However, the majority of authorities con-sider the gestational surrogate to be the legal mother of the child.106 The minor-ity opinion is that the genetic mother is the legal mother of the child.107 Another101. One rabbinic authority explains the oral law as follows:It is impossible for the Torah of God to have covered all possible cases that may ever arise,because the new situations that constantly arise in human affairs, in law, and as a result ofhuman enterprise are so manifold that a book cannot encompass them. Therefore, generalprinciples, which the Torah only briefly suggests, were revealed orally to Moses at Sinai,so that halakhic authorities of every generation would use them to derive new laws.MENACHEM ELON, CASE BOOK: JEWISH LAW 6 (1988) (citing JOSEPH ALBO, SEFER HA-IKKARIM [THEBOOK OF PRINCIPLES] 3:23).102. The Talmud was compiled during the end of the 5th century C.E. The Talmud consists ofthe Mishnah and Gemara. The Mishnah is divided into six orders and although its origins are dis-puted, the majority view maintains that it was written by Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi at the end of the 2ndcentury C.E. The Gemara provides a commentary on these codified laws. There is a BabylonianTalmud [hereinafter B. Talmud] and a Jerusalem Talmud [hereinafter J. Talmud] that use differentGemara. While both Talmuds are used and may be influential, the Babylonian Talmud takes prece-dence. See MENACHEM ELON, JEWISH LAW 224-27, 1091-98 (1994).103. The responsa literature, or “case law” of the Jewish people, consists of decisions written bydiverse legal authorities in the post-Talmudic period in response to individual questions posed toRabbis. See ELON, supra note 102, at 1454-528. Responsa is binding only on those who ask a questiondirectly or for those in a community which has chosen to accept the opinions of a religious authorityupon them.104. A commentator gives an opinion that is not binding on any particular individual case whilea posek gives an opinion in direct response to a question asked. The opinion given is then binding onthe person who asks and whomever follows the interpretation of Jewish law by that Rabbi.

Therefore, at the earli-est stage possible, the time of insemination, the identity of the child is alreadydetermined by its genetic make-up.115 He also argues that fatherhood and moth-erhood are defined in the same manner, from the first drop of seed from bothmale and female, upon fertilization.116Rabbi Itamar Warhaftig asserts that logically, it is the egg donor and not thesurrogate mother who should be considered the mother.117 His logical basis forthis conclusion is that it is the genes of the genetic mother and father that willdetermine the characteristics of the child and that the womb of the surrogate isnothing more than the place of growth.118 Furthermore, he argues that concep-Mother When Eggs Are Donated?

However, in a later re-sponsum when asked about the genealogy of a child born from a donor egg inseminated with thehusband’s sperm and gestated by the wife, he decides that the women who gives birth to the child isthe mother.

He makes ananalogy to an agricultural dispute discussed in The Talmud.120 The Talmud dis-cusses an olive sapling that is washed away by the river to a neighbor’s fieldwhere it continues to grow.121 One party claims that it is his olive sapling andthus he owns it. The other party claims that it was his land that facilitated thetree’s growth; and therefore, he should be considered the owner. It is deter-mined that there is a preference for the owner of the olive sapling.122 By analogythe genetic donation of the egg is compared to the contribution of the sapling,which establishes ownership.The vast majority of opinions, however, claim that the surrogate mother isthe legal mother. There are four major sources from which scholars have drawnproof that the surrogate is the legal mother of the child. The first is based on adiscussion of conversion of a woman during her pregnancy in The Talmud,123 re-lied upon by two highly regarded Rabbinical figures: Rabbi Zalman NechemiaGoldberg124 and Rabbi Eliezer Yehudah Calev.125 The Talmud explains that twotwin brothers, who are non-Jews, and subsequently convert, have no obligationsin chalizah or yibum, (levirate marriage), and are not obligated to refrain frommarrying each other’s wives.126 Upon conversion to Judaism, all prior familialrelationships are legally severed according to Jewish law.127In contrast, twins who were conceived when their parents were non-Jewsand were born to a Jewish woman (she converts while she is pregnant), are notobligated in chalizah and yibum (levirate marriage), but are obligated not to119.

Calev, supra note 98, at 260-61. Rabbi Calev uses the same proof text as Goldberg, howeverhe limits the holding to a Jewish egg born to a Jewish woman. If the egg is from a non-Jewishwoman, he holds that the fetus would not be converted—for those who believe that the fetus is notpart of the mother—if the conversion of the fetus wasn’t intended. Therefore, the familial relation-ship to the birth mother is dependent on the birth mother’s intent to convert the fetus. In the casewhere there is no conversion of the fetus, i.e., in gestational surrogacy where the surrogate mother isJewish and the egg donor is not Jewish, the natural status of the egg donor as the mother prevailsover the Jewish law determination that the surrogate (birth mother) is the mother. In other words, ifthe egg donor is non-Jewish, the child is considered non-Jewish and, therefore, Jewish law does notdetermine maternity.126. B. Talmud, Yevamot 97(b). Chalizah and Yibum are complex religious obligations. If a mar-ried man dies leaving no children, Jewish law encourages his widowed wife to marry her deceasedhusband’s brother in order to conceive children that will continue deceased’s husband’s line. If thebrother marries the wife of his deceased brother this is called Yibum. If, however, he does not wantto marry her he must release her by performing Chalizah (removal of the obligation). This obligationis in stark contrast to the strict prohibition on a man from marrying his brother’s wife after hisbrother dies, if the deceased brother did have children with his wife. In contemporary times, Yibumis not performed; rather, the Rabbis have mandated that the proper course is Chalizah. For a thor-ough explanation of the concepts of Yibum and Chalizah, the history of the obligation and an expla-nation of the way they are practiced today, see PRINCIPLES, supra note 104, at 403-09.127. For a full explanation of a theoretical rebirth that severs all previous familial ties upon con-version to Judaism see Bleich, supra note 108, at 49-50.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PM108 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 9:91 2002marry their brother’s wife.128 Rashi, a commentator on The Talmud, suggests thatthe reason they are not obligated in chalizah and yibum but are obligated not tomarry each other’s wives is that the obligation of chalizah and yibum derivesfrom paternal lineage, and that not marrying a brother’s wife, follows from ma-ternal lineage.129 Since fatherhood is determined at conception, and they arenow considered converts, they have severed ties to their father and are ex-empted from obligations based on their father’s lineage. However, since moth-erhood is established upon birth, the obligations that are derived from lineage totheir mother still hold. In conclusion, if motherhood were determined by ge-netic input or upon conception, the conversion of the mother would have sev-ered her ties to her children and their ties to each other.130 However, after thetwins’ birth they are still considered brothers from their maternal lineage in thatthey are prohibited from marrying each other’s wives. If no familial tie existedthere would be no marital prohibition because they would not be consideredbrothers at all.131 Therefore, in accordance with this source, it has been arguedthat it is birth that determines motherhood.Another Talmudic source,132 cited by Rabbi Calev133 and discussed by othersas well,134 discusses an aggadic interpretation (homiletic tale) of the biblical storyof Rachel and Leah.135 The allegorical source refers to an intra-uterine transfer ofDinah from the womb of Rachel to the womb of Leah and an intra-uterine trans-fer of Joseph from the womb of Leah to the womb of Rachel. Subsequent refer-ences in scripture refer to Dinah as the daughter of Leah and Joseph as the sonof Rachel, despite the supposed switch. Ostensibly, this tale indicates that eachchild has a single mother and that the mother is the birth mother, not the geneticmother. This analogy marks parturition rather than gestation or egg donation asthe establishing variable of motherhood.While some authorities will not use allegory in matters of determiningJewish law,136 many other authorities have held that if the allegorical interpreta-128.

There is considerable disagreement as to whether the children themselves also convert, orwhether they do not convert and receive their status upon birth. This disagreement arises from thequestion of whether a fetus is considered to be part of the mother or a separate entity. For this articleit is not crucial to decide this question because the child’s relationship to its mother would be sev-ered if motherhood was determined upon conception—because upon her conversion she would nolonger be related to her children. For a discussion of this disagreement, see Calev, supra note 98, andGoldberg, supra note 106.131.

The Tal-mud explains that her father died as soon as her mother conceived and that hermother perished upon her birth; and therefore, she never had a mother or a fa-ther.139In his article, Rabbi Nechemiah Goldberg brings the interpretation of thistale by Rabbi Joseph Engel,140 who concludes from this source that men andwomen create parental relations in distinct ways.141 Rabbi Engel argues that afetus can have a father while it is still in the womb, but the motherhood relation-ship is not determined until the birth of the child.142 Rabbi Engel explains thatthe reason that Esther never had a mother is that during the pregnancy the fetusis considered to be part of its mother.143 Therefore, only parturition establishesmotherhood, in contrast to the determination of fatherhood.144 He emphasizesthat motherhood and fatherhood are essentially different and are established bydifferent factors.145Rabbi Yehoshua Ben-Meir also concludes that the gestational mother is thelegal mother under Jewish law and he uses yet another argument to draw thisconclusion.146 He argues that the identity of the mother can be derived from TheTalmud’s determination that during the first 40 days of its formation, the embryois considered to be only water.147 He concludes that we can relate to the implantof fertilized eggs “as if it were a medicinal potion given to the woman as atreatment against barrenness—fertilized water.”148 Since the fertilized egg is not137.

Rabbi Bleich concludes that, “the preponderance of theevidence adduced from Rabbinic sources demonstrates that the consensus ofRabbinic opinion is that a maternal-filial relationship is generated between thegestational mother and the child, despite the absence of any genetic relationship,by virtue of parturition alone.”149 Rabbi Bleich argues, however, that while themajority of sources hold that the birth mother is the legal mother, it is necessaryto be cautions in the face of uncertainty. He therefore believes that both mothersshould be considered legal mothers.150Rabbi Ezra Bick argues that this issue cannot be determined definitivelyfrom the sources; rather, he maintains that the whole issue demands a morebroad conceptual approach.151 He argues, “Essentially, this question is not sus-ceptible to the classic halakhic approach of analogy with an existent halakhic rul-ing. Not only does a “preponderance” of halakhic sources not exist in favor ofparturition as the maternal determinant, practically speaking, no halakhic sourcesexist for this or any competing candidate for the determinant.”152 He argues thatwhile the sources may relate to the issue of determining motherhood, they donot do so conclusively and the laws derived are speculative.153 Rabbi Bick in-stead turns to deriving the identity of the mother, “from the general conceptualframework of the Sages concerning conception, on the assumption that, in theabsence of negative evidence, the proper legal definition of conception in regardto the determination of parenthood will be congruent with that general frame-work.”154 This method of deriving law is contested,155 but does find support inJewish thought, particularly when dealing with ethical issues for which no legalprecedent is readily available.156149. Id.150. Bleich, supra note 12, at 166.151. Bick, supra note 106, at 85.152. Id. at 84.153. Id. at 84-88. Rabbi Bick argues that the analogies used are imperfect and points out a num-ber of logical flaws, such as the major proof used about the women who converts while carryingtwins. Bick argues that this proof is flawed because in the case of a pregnant convert, the determi-nant of conception has been annulled by the conversion (because conversion annuls all familiar rela-tions). No such annulment occurs in surrogacy. He also argues that the case of the pregnant convertonly proves that familial relations are determined at birth, not that birth determines familial rela-tions. The maternal relationship could have been caused by conception but only becomes estab-lished when the child is born. In addition, even if birth alone determines maternity, it might be ar-gued that genetic continuity is a necessary condition for such a determination. Id. at 84-87. He alsoargues that the proof from the story of Rachel and Leah is not only dubious because it is from an ag-gadic source, but also because it is not clearly discussed in the text of Genesis whether Dina was con-sidered the legal daughter of Leah or whether she was known as such because Leah raised her.Surely, Leah and Rachel were unaware of this theoretical intrauterine transfer. But see BLEICH, supranote 105 (defending the traditional halakhic analogies).154. Bick, supra note 106, at 96.155. See BLEICH, supra note 105, at 114 (responding to Bick’s article supra note 106).156. This method is similar to basing a decision on aggadah, which is commonly used when thereare a lack of legal sources. However, it can be differentiated because it encompasses a second levelof abstraction. Rabbi Bick is not only basing the determination on a homiletic source, he is goingLAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 111Rabbi Bick explores a more general approach to childbirth and the roles ofmen and women in creating children to determine the Jewish approach to theissue.157 Ultimately, he adopts the view that the surrogate mother is the legalmother.158 Rabbi Bick first explains that the easiest conceptual solution to theproblem would be biological, based on the scientific knowledge that both awoman and a man contribute seed to the creation of a child.159 However, sincethe Talmudic sources do not mention the female ovum, to the degree that theRabbis of The Talmud had a concept of motherhood, such a concept must be de-finable without reference to the ovum.160 Instead, he shapes what he terms the“agricultural model” with references in rabbinic literature to the principle thatthe female is identified with receptivity. One such example is as follows:R. Levi said: the upper waters are male and the lower female. The one says tothe other, “Receive us; you are God’s creatures and we are His messengers.”Immediately, they receive them, as is written (Isa. 45:8), “[Drop down, heavens,from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness,] let the earth open”—asa female opening herself to a male—“and be fruitful with salvation”—they pro-create.161This excerpt is an interpretation of Genesis, which clearly views woman as a re-ceiver, who by receiving becomes fruitful.Ultimately, Rabbi Bick asks: “What is the difference between an ‘agricul-tural’ model and a ‘biological’ model of motherhood?”162 His answer neatlysums up the most significant difference between the secular law resolutions onthe issue of motherhood discussed above, and the Jewish resolution on the issue:The latter (biological model) either denies or at least attaches no importance tothe differences between male and female. They both donate genetic materialand together they constitute the embryo. Maternity and paternity are identical;simply the different names we give to the same position when filled by mem-bers of the two sexes, . . . The former model (agricultural model), while positingparallel roles, it is only through the joint participation of the two that an embryofurther by first deriving general principles from these sources and then applying them to an entirelynew scenario—and the two methods are certainly comparable. There are many circumstances inwhich the only source for halakhah is reason or the consent of the people. There are also instanceswhere the source of the law is simply equity, an understanding of justice. See AVI SAGI, JUDAISM:BETWEEN RELIGION AND MORALITY 116-20 (1999) (arguing that Jewish law is derived not from a sin-gular but from a variety of conceptual sources including reason and consent).Rabbi Bick offers another example of what he considers deriving a law from a determination ofwhat Talmudic Sages might have said: “The different opinions concerning the use of electricity onShabbat reflect such as process. Although the definition of boneh (building) may be derived from theTalmud, the Hazon Ish’s extension of it to electricity is based on a completely new conceptualizationof the nature of an electric current, which obviously has no basis in the Talmud itself. The Hazon Ishhas a model for electricity and tries to decide what the Talmud Sages would have said about it.”Bick, supra note 106, at 105 n.19.157. Bick, supra note 106, at 89-96.158. Id.159.

He argues that it makes sense to give status to thatwhich makes a man different from a woman, since such differences are givenmuch credence in Jewish law.Rabbi Bick offers a conceptual orientation to the issue from a broad over-view of Jewish law. He posits that Jewish law should give special considerationto the legal status of the surrogate as the birth mother due to the law’s sensitiv-ity to, and emphasis on, the differences between men and women. This under-standing provides a broader, philosophical background to the more legalisticdeterminations that have been made.III. ENFORCEABILITY OF THE ISRAELI SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD AGREEMENTS LAWA. The Jewish Law Determination of Motherhood and the New IsraeliSurrogacy LawThe Surrogate Agreements Law contains many provisions that attempt toincorporate aspects of Jewish law in order to avoid problems that might arisewith the religious communities in Israel. Specifically, the law takes into consid-eration the Jewish stigma of mamzer.165 A mamzer is a child born as a result of anadulterous relationship between a married woman and a man who is not herhusband or through incestuous relations.166 If a child is deemed a mamzer, thechild is not permitted to marry under Jewish law except to another mamzer.Since the Rabbinical courts have jurisdiction over personal status in Israel, in-cluding marriage, a mamzer would not be able to marry in Israel. Furthermore,if the person attempts to marry in some other forum, it would create tensionbetween the religious and secular communities in Israel.163. Id. at 101.164. Id. at 102; see also infra Part VI for a discussion of gender difference in Jewish law.165. It should be noted that incorporating religious considerations into Israeli law in the relatedarea of artificial insemination by a donor (AID) has not been so readily accepted. According to Jew-ish law, if the procedure is permitted at all, which is a matter of serious disagreement, the sperm do-nor’s identity would certainly have to be made public. However, such information is not public, andthere is a considerable threat of mamzerut due to the widespread use of the procedure. The onlyregulation that has been passed in this area is The Public Health (Sperm Bank) Regulations, 1979,K.T. 39996, 1448. Artificial insemination is practiced regularly in Israel, although the law does notmandate public registration of the male donor. See Michael Korinaldi, The Legal Status of a Child Bornof Artificial Insemination from a Donor or from an Egg Donor, 18 SHNATON HAMISHPAT HAIVRI 295(1995); Halperin-Kaddari, supra note 34, at 334-35.166. The stigma of mamzerut does not derive from relationships of a married man with anotherwoman because according to Jewish law, before it was outlawed by a rabbinic decree a man couldmarry more than one woman. See PRINCIPLES, supra note 104, at 435; NOAM ZOHAR, ALTERNATIVESIN JEWISH BIOETHICS 78-80 (1997).LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 113Furthermore, due to Jewish law’s general opposition to artificial insemina-tion by a donor, the use of a donor sperm is prohibited and the father must bethe genetic father of the child.167 In addition, the surrogate mother and the ovumdonor must be of the same religion as the intended mother in order to accom-modate those Jewish law authorities that have expressed uncertainty as to thereligion of the child born from a surrogate, whether the child takes on the relig-ion of the ovum donor or the surrogate.168 A number of commentators have ex-plored and analyzed the effect that these halakhic caveats have had on the Surro-gacy Law.169However, the law does not reflect consideration for the majority Jewish lawposition that the surrogate mother is the legal mother. As discussed in depthabove, the intended parents are considered the legal parents.170 The surrogatemother’s identity must be officially recorded according to the Israeli law, but shedoes not retain any rights to the child that would necessitate an adoption, nordoes she have more than a very narrow right of withdrawal from the contract.171More significant than the Israeli law’s lack of consideration for the Jewishperspective on this matter is the religious authorities’ own antipathy. It seemsreasonable to assume that since the majority view in Jewish law is that the ges-tational mother is the legal mother, Jewish authorities would object to surrogateagreements that forcefully alienate the legal mother from her natural child.172This is especially the case considering Jewish law’s emphasis on biology andstatus.173A number of rabbinic authorities have voiced objections to the surrogatemotherhood process due to misgivings about alienating child-rearing from thesanctity of marriage and the marital bed,174 out of concern about the technologythat facilitates it.175 However, published responsa have not raised objections tothe surrogate motherhood process based on the alienation of the natural mother.In Israel, surrogate motherhood has been expressly permitted by some of themost respected rabbinic authorities. Both the Sephardic Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Bak-167. Id.; Surrogate Agreements Law, 1996 S.H. 1577 §2(4); see infra Part VI for an explanation ofAID and Jewish law’s opposition to it.168. See supra note 125 for a discussion of this concern. This was confirmed as a halakhic consid-eration by Dr. Halperin. See infra note 193.169. See Shalev, supra note 34, at 64-76; see also Halperin-Kaddari, supra note 34, at 333-35.170. See Surrogate Agreements Law, 1996 S.H. 1577, §10(a).171. Id. § 13a, 29. Section 13(a) discusses the limited right to withdraw from the contract, andsection 29 addresses the requirement to register the birth mother for purposes of lineage. The reper-cussions for not accounting for the status of the birth mother in Jewish law are less precarious thanthe other religious considerations because it will not create problems of illegitimacy, as long theidentity of the birth mother is recorded and can be checked, which is required by the law.172.

In traditional surrogacy,where the surrogate mother is considered the legal mother, the courts and manystate legislatures have made such contracts illegal or void as against public pol-icy, provided an option for no cause withdrawal, or required a custody hearing,as was the case in In re Baby M.183 In gestational surrogacy, where the intended176.

Rather, they have condoned the law or con-demned it for other reasons.The next sections will explore possible reasons for this difference. One pos-sible reason for the lack of relevance of the natural mother in Jewish law is thatJewish law, unlike U.S. law, would uphold and enforce surrogate motherhoodagreements that allow the legal mother to waive her motherhood rights beforethe birth of the child. The acceptance of the contract would make the issue ofwho is the legal or natural mother prior to the contract irrelevant, except forpurposes of recording the natural mother’s identity. Custody of the child wouldthen be legally transferred to the intended parents under Jewish law. Althoughexploration of this contractual option is necessary to fully understand why sur-rogacy has been accepted despite the mother’s legal rights under Jewish law, itis important to note that the legal authorities who have permitted such contractshave not provided the validity of the contract as a basis for their affirmation.The next section will consider whether Jewish contract law would allow asurrogate motherhood contract to be enforced despite the surrogate’s legalstatus of mother. Part IV will discuss other aspects of Jewish law that mightlead authorities to overlook the rights of the legal mother.B. Is the Surrogacy Agreement Obligating the Birth Mother to Transfer theChild to the Intended Mother Binding Under Jewish Law?1. Renting a Womb or Baby-SellingIn considering whether or not a contract for the transfer of a child is bind-ing under Jewish law, one must first characterize the nature of the contract. Thisarticle assumes that the contract is commercial as is set forth in the Israeli Surro-gacy Law.184 One option for characterizing the contract is as an obligation of thebirth mother to surrender her rights to raise the child and to agree to the adop-tion of the child by the intended parents. Alternately, the contract can beviewed as renting the womb of the surrogate mother as an incubator for the in-tended parents’ child.However, this second characterization of the contract is not consistent withthe Jewish law view of motherhood. The surrogate mother is more than just awomb for rent according to Jewish law. As stated by the majority opinion, she isin fact the legal mother, and therefore the child in her womb does not simplybelong to someone else while she temporarily nurtures it to viability.184. Surrogate Agreements Law, supra note 15, at § 6. Other jurisdictions have permitted onlyvoluntary non-commercial agreements. Non-commercial agreements avoid the ethical complica-tions of selling babies or renting a womb, while maintaining the potential for surrogate motherhoodin the framework of an altruistic agreement. See, e.g., VA. CODE ANN. §§ 20-159, -160(B)(4) (Michie1995).LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PM116 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 9:91 2002In Jewish law, baby-selling law may be less problematic than in other legalsystems. Prohibitions against the selling of a person in Jewish law relate to theselling of a person into servitude.185 In surrogacy arrangements, the child is notsold into slavery; rather, the right to raise the child is transferred. The differencein sensibilities between Western ethics and Jewish law should be understood inthe context of a different perspective on parenting. Raising a child is viewed asan obligation and not a right under Jewish law, so it is not expected that onewould pay for this duty.186 Ostensibly, the prohibition against receiving moneyfor the sale of persons is based on a fear of control over another human being inslavery and not a blanket prohibition against transferring a child for considera-tion.187Rabbi David Bleich argues that baby selling is not prohibited under Jewishlaw.188 He brings an example to illustrate this point from Sefer Hasidim.189 SeferHasidim advises parents that have lost a previous child to change their namesand thereby their identities in order to divert the negative heavenly decree ontheir persons.190 The procedure he recommends is to conceptually sell their in-fants who have died to a friend for a nominal fee, thereby diverting the negativehistory from them.191 This recommendation assumes the permissibility of sellingof a child.Western morality tends to view a surrogacy contract as a contract for serv-ices, whereas Jewish law is more apt to view the contract as one for the transferof the child, as the gestational mother is the legal mother and baby selling is notas legally problematic.2. A Contract for That Which is Not Yet in ExistenceCharacterizing the surrogacy contract as an obligation to surrender thechild to adoption before its birth does create a number of legal problems in Jew-ish law. The first is the concept of “dvar shelo ba le’olem” (“things that do not ex-ist in the world”). Contracts for objects or items of value that do not yet exist, orare not yet in the possession of the seller, are not recognized under Jewish law.192In his capacity as advisor to the Ministry of Health, Rabbi Dr. Mordechai Hal-185. See Leviticus 25:39-42 (“If thy brother who dwells by thee be grown poor, and be sold to thee,thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant . . . he . . . shall serve thee until the year of theJubilee, and then shall . . . he return to his own family. For they are my servants, whom I broughtout of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bondsmen.”).186. See infra Part V(C) (child custody).187. See Povarsky, supra note 95, at 454.188.

The theory is that as a different person, the parent is entitled to a new hearing againstthe heavenly decree. On rehearing, the heavenly court may find some new merit, presumably not ofsufficient strength to abrogate an already-entered judgment, but possibly sufficient to prevent theentry of a newly-formed unfavorable decree. Id.191. Id.192. See, e.g., B. Talmud, Bava Metzia 33(b); Moses Maimonides, MISHNEH TORAH, SEFER KINYAN[The Book of Acquisition] 22:1; CHOSHEN MISHPAT, SHULCHAN ARUCH 209:4 (relating to civil lawand business ethics); see also PRINCIPLES, supra note 104, at 248-49; GOLD, supra note 205, at 122.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 117perin believes that this concept would nullify a surrogate motherhood agree-ment in Jewish law.193However, most Jewish authorities believe that something not yet in exis-tence can be charged as an obligation or lien on a person in favor of the obligee,rather than a transfer of rights to the object itself, which is not yet in existence.194Since the lien is not on the object but an obligation on a person, who does exist,it is considered valid. Dr. Chaim Povarsky recommends viewing the surrogacyagreement not as an obligation to transfer a child not yet in existence, but ratheras an obligation on the part of the surrogate mother to transfer the child to thefather’s sole custody, thereby avoiding the problem of the impermissibility ofcontracting for things that are not yet in existence (dvar shelo ba le’olam).1953. Contracts for Personal ServicesHowever, an obligation upon the mother to relinquish the child to the solecustody of the father and his wife is fraught with further difficulty. Since thecontract can not be characterized as a right upon the child itself, but rather, as anobligation upon the mother, such an obligation must be characterized as one forpersonal services, the service of providing the child. Unlike tangible goods ormoney to which a person has a right of property, the gestational mother doesnot have a similar right to a child; she has a duty to raise the child.196 Therefore,in a contract for a child, unlike an obligation for goods, she is obliging herself toperform a service, such as the transfer of the child, not a relegation of her rightsto the child, because the intended parents cannot place a lien on a right tosomething the mother does not have.However, a future obligation to perform personal services or physical actsis of questionable validity under Jewish law. In western legal systems, a prom-ise to perform a service, if there is consideration, would be valid as a right to suea person to perform, or pay damages where specific performance is not permit-ted. Dr. Povarsky explains that in Jewish law, it is generally accepted that anobligation to work or perform a service or a physical act does not establish a lienagainst a person of the obligor, as does a proprietary obligation or debt.197 This193. Mordechai Halperin, Surrogate Mother, 7 REFUAH U’MISHPAT [MEDICINE AND LAW] 47 (1997).194. An obligation on a person is called shiabud haguf (a lien on a body) as opposed to a right toproperty. See Shulchan Aruch, CHOSHEN MISHPAT 60:6; Tosafot on B. Talmud, Ketubot 54(b); Asher(Rosh) on B. Talmud, Ketubot 54(b); Moses Sofer (Chatam Sofer) on B. Talmud, Ketubot 54(b). Forsecondary sources explaining this matter see Povarsky, supra note 95, at 457-58; PRINCIPLES, supranote 104, at 249-50.195. Povarsky, supra note 95, at 452.196. See infra Part IV(C) on custody in Jewish law.197. See Povarsky, supra note 95, at 452. An obligation to perform a certain act may refer either tothe service involved in the performance of the act or to the carrying out of the act itself. Insofar asthe obligation refers to the service, the obligation does not establish a lien against the person of theobligor because a lien for performing services is regarded as a kind of slavery. This principle isbased on the talmudic ruling in which an employee is allowed to quit his work at any time, subjectto damages he might have to pay the employer for actual losses the latter suffered as a result of theemployee’s resignation. The Talmud quotes Scripture stating, “For the children of Israel are slavesunto me, they are my slaves. . . .” Leviticus 25:55. The repetitious statement “they are my slaves”was interpreted to mean, “They are my slaves but not slaves to other slaves”; that is, Israelites arerequired not to enslave themselves [hereinafter the Slavery Argument]. See B. Talmud, Bava Metzia10(a); Asher (Rosh) on Bava Metzia 10(a). There is a general attitude in Jewish law that any engage-LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PM118 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 9:91 2002is because a lien against a person to perform an act is considered a kind of slav-ery, which cannot be undertaken through such a contract.198 A contract that doesnot create a proprietary obligation is considered kinyan devarim (“the appropria-tion of words”) and is invalid. In an agreement between two parties to performsome specific service, or a certain action, either side can back out of the agree-ment until the moment of its performance.199However, it is contested whether an independent contractor is includedunder those who cannot make a binding contract for personal services.200 Thesurrogate mother would presumably be considered an independent contractorbecause she is hired to perform a specific service, not for a period of time. Ac-cording to Rabbi Yaakov, a prominent 12th century Tosafist scholar also knownas Rabbeinu Tam, an independent contractor—as opposed to an employee—cannot retract from his obligation to perform services because an independentcontractor is not regarded as a slave.201 The Rosh, another medieval halakhicauthority, argues that such a contract cannot be binding on an independentcontractor or an employee.202 Other scholars have agreed with the Rosh.203The majority of authorities would agree that an employee might back outof his contract without consequence if the employer will not suffer irretrievableloss. There is, however, disagreement about the ability of an independent con-tractor to back out of a contract.204 It is therefore not clear whether a surrogatemother’s obligation to transfer the child would be binding upon her. It is a diffi-cult question that necessitates extensive rabbinical analysis.4. Meeting of the MindsIn addition to the problems with the surrogacy contract stated above, thereis a further question of whether this contract is truly a meeting of the minds, orin Hebrew, “asmachta.” According to Jewish law, a contract is only valid if it canment of a laborer, even of his own free will, is a form of restraint on personal liberty, thus the laborerhas special rights for his protection, B. Talmud, Bava Metzia 10(a); 77(a)198. See discussion supra note 197 (regarding Leviticus 25:55).199. In the Talmud, the following example is given: if two neighbors share a fence and want todivide it between themselves, they must make a mutual agreement. If they agree to divide the fenceon the following day according to an agreed-upon measurement, they have not created any obliga-tion until they act upon the agreement. See B. Talmud, Baba Batra 3:1.200. For employees, labor laws under Jewish law provide that if something will definitely be lostif the worker does not fulfill his obligation under the labor agreement then the worker, whether anemployee or independent contractor, will be liable for damages. However, if the worker backs outand the employer does not have to lose any money, but only loses out on the contract, it is generallyagreed upon that an employee does not have any obligation to the employer. B. Talmud, Bava Met-zia 77(a).201. See Povarsky, supra note 95, at 453 (citing Tosafot, Bava Metzia 48(a)). The surrogate motherwould be considered an independent contractor because she is hired not for a specified period oftime, but to complete a specified “project.” See PRINCIPLES, supra note 104, at 310 (citing MaggidMishneh Sekhirut 9:4).202. Piske HaRosh, B. Talmud, Baba Metzia 77(a).203.

Talmud Bava Metzia 48(a)).204. See Povarsky, supra note 95, at 451-53.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 119be reasonably presumed that the intentions of both parties are serious, deliber-ate, and final.205The Israeli Surrogate Agreements Law is careful to provide safeguards forfull and meaningful agreement.206 The Committee must make certain, beforeapproving the surrogacy agreement, that all parties entering the agreement havedone so of their free will, and understand its significance and consequence. Ad-ditionally, there must be no misgivings about the health of the birth mother, orthe child that will be born, or the rights of either of the parties.207Despite safeguards, it is reasonable to doubt that a true meeting of theminds can occur with regard to the transfer of a child not yet born. Rabbi Goldargues that due to the vast difference in the psychological perspective of amother before a baby is born and after it is born, the doctrine of asmachta wouldlikely invalidate the contract.208 Doubts have been expressed by Dr. Halperin, amember of the Aloni Commission, as to the possibility of fulfilling such condi-tions.209 In interview for an Israeli newspaper, he states that he is not sure thatthere is even a possibility of ascertaining whether people really understand allthe consequences and significance of the surrogacy contract.210 There also can beno guarantees against mental or physical harm.211 He goes on to imply that un-der the standards of the Israeli law itself, it is unlikely that any surrogacy con-tract could be approved.212 Despite the safeguards, it is possible that the strictJewish law requirement of a full meeting of the minds would preclude the en-forceability of contract to surrender one’s own child made before its birth.In conclusion, it is not simple to assert the enforceability of a contract totransfer custody of a child born of a surrogate mother but it is possible. Inmaking decisions about whether to hold these contracts enforceable, Jewish le-gal authorities may be inclined to characterize the contract in a more intuitiveway, either as a contract for gestational services, or as a contract for the babythat does not yet exist—both of which would not be enforceable under Jewishlaw. In addition, ensuring true consent on the part of the mother is exacerbatedby the fact that she is the legal mother under Jewish law, and her consent isquestionable under the doctrine of asmachta. Based on the aforementioned legalobstacles to approving such agreements, those commentators who have dis-cussed the matter have surmised that such contracts would not be enforceable.213205.

In any event, careful analysis would be needed to explain how the enforce-ability of the surrogacy arrangements justifies permitting the waiving of mater-nal affiliation.The following section will discuss some additional principles of Jewish lawthat might lead authorities to permit surrogate motherhood agreements,whether they are willing to state definitively that such contracts in and of them-selves are valid under Jewish law. Such justifications go farther to explain whylegal authorities have condoned the Israeli Surrogacy Agreements Law despitethe Jewish identification of the birth mother as the mother.IV. FURTHER PRINCIPLES OF JEWISH LAW RELEVANT TO THE DETERMINATIONOF THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE ISRAELI SURROGATE AGREEMENTSLAW PROVISIONS UNDER JEWISH LAWBesides the potential enforceability of the surrogate motherhood contract,there are other reasons that might underlie a Jewish legal acceptance of surro-gate motherhood arrangements. These principles include: the command to befruitful and multiply incumbent upon men, the absence of the concept of adop-tion in Jewish law, and Jewish law’s focus on obligations as opposed to rights inmatters of custody.A. The Commandment to be Fruitful and MultiplyThe Commandment to be fruitful and multiply is derived from passages inGenesis.214 The Rabbis have interpreted this commandment to be applicableonly to men and to be fulfilled with the birth of two children.215In a certain form, surrogate motherhood was practiced in biblical times.Abraham’s wife Sara and Jacob’s wives, Rachel and Leah, all enlisted otherwomen on their quests to have children. Rachel said to her husband Jacob, “Be-hold my maid, Bilhah, go in unto her, and that she may bear upon my knees,and I also obtain children by her.”216 However, the difference between thesescenarios and modern day surrogate motherhood is that under biblical law, aman could have many wives or concubines; the term adultery in The Bible refersexclusively to infidelity committed by a married woman. In these biblical sto-ries, the surrogate mother was herself part of the household of the male withwhom she slept. Therefore, the woman was a surrogate wife, not a surrogate bycontract. She did not have to give up her child; rather, she agreed to raise thechildren in the household of the father and his primary wives.supra note 205, at 120-27 (concluding that Jewish tradition would likely not consider a surrogacycontract legally binding, but would consider it morally binding).214.

Talmud, TractateYevamot, 6: 61, p. 2 and in Berachot, 15:1.216. Genesis 30:3.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 121Professor Pinhas Shifman stresses the importance of the obligation to pro-create in the Jewish authorities’ discussions of new reproductive technologies.217According to The Talmud, if a man marries a woman who fails to give birthwithin ten years, he must take additional steps to fulfill his duty of procrea-tion.218 He is required either to divorce his first wife or to take a second wife.219However, in 1028, Rabbeinu Tam prohibited polygamy, as well as divorce with-out the consent of the woman.220 Therefore, according to the tenets of modernJudaism, it is no longer acceptable to take another wife in order to fulfill thecommandment to be fruitful and multiply, nor is it acceptable to have extra-marital relations.221 However, using artificial insemination or in vitro fertilizationto fulfill this command may be not only acceptable, but even a religious duty.222Prof. Shifman postulates that according to this analysis, “[T]he procurement ofsurrogate motherhood would be looked upon as a religious duty.”223Regardless of whether such treatments are able to help fulfill this com-mandment or whether some might even say they are mandatory, it might moti-vate Rabbis to permit the procedure, despite some other problems with the le-gality of the arrangements.Rabbi Goldberg’s discussion with the Surrogate Motherhood ApprovalsCommittee reveals his own reliance on the importance of procreation in Jewishlaw.224 He specifically says that he would likely recommend that a woman en-gage in a surrogate agreement in accordance with the Israeli law for her firstchild, but would not a priori recommend it for the second child.225 He explainsthat while the fulfillment of the command to be “fruitful and multiply” is con-tingent upon having two children, only if a couple does not have any childrenmust the husband go to extremes to produce a child, including asking for a di-vorce.226 However, if the couple has one child, even without complete fulfill-ment of the commandment there is no necessity for divorce.227 Rabbi Goldberg’sexplanation demonstrates that his acceptance of the use of surrogate mother-hood is influenced by the need to have at least one child. He emphasizes theimportance of the commandment to procreate, even to the point of overridingother potential prohibitions.228217.

But see Bleich, supra note 188, at 391.

Insistingthat a gestational mother must consent after the child’s birth would likely dis-courage such procedures.229 But while this may be an explanation, it does notjustify ignoring the maternal affiliation of the birth mother and of the child. It isproblematic to ignore the legal status of the birth mother in order allow men tofulfill a commandment. There is significant precedent for putting less emphasison this commandment in order to preserve the honor and status of the womenconcerned.230 Authorities have cautioned men against divorcing their wives tofulfill the commandment, in deference to their wives’ feelings.231 Similar consid-eration might be applicable in the case of surrogate motherhood, where thestatus of the birth mother is denigrated.B. Adoption under Jewish LawA likely explanation for Jewish authorities’ lack of insistence that surrogacycontracts provide for formal adoption of the child, instead of an immediatetransfer of parental rights, is that Jewish law does not recognize the concept oflegal adoption.232 De facto adoption was common in biblical times, e.g., theadoption of Moses by Batya, the daughter of Pharaoh, and other examples of achild being born to one set of parents and then raised by another.233 Despitethe children is merely the terminus ad quem beyond which sexual activity within the context of amarital relationship yields the conclusion that no form of assisted procreation is mandatory.” Id. Hecites as proof the fact that artificial reproduction is not considered mandatory by the vast majority ofJewish Law authorities. See also Bleich, Sperm Banking in Anticipation of Infertility, 29/4 TRADITION 47,53-36. However, not mandating artificial reproduction can also be explained by Jewish law opinionsthat forbid or take issue with such procedures. See supra notes 184-85. Even if these procedures areacceptable to one Rabbi, he may not want to mandate that which is questionable according to otherrespected authorities. In addition, such procedures can be difficult emotionally and complicatedphysically. Rabbi Bleich does not account for the legal Jewish precept, discussed above, which or-ders a man to make other arrangements to fulfill the commandment to procreate after ten years ofcohabitating with his wife. See B. Talmud, Yevamot 64(a). There is much discussion related to what ahusband’s responsibilities are after the ban, with much disagreement as to the proper recourse. SeeDAVID FELDMAN, BIRTH CONTROL IN JEWISH LAW 36-41 (1968). Rabbi Bleich is in the minority be-cause according to most Jewish law authorities, the act of regular intercourse with one’s wife doesnot fulfill the commandment.229. See ALONI COMMISSION, supra note 17, at 45.230. See, e.g., Feldman, supra note 220, at 40 (citing R. Jacob Tannenbaum, Responsa NahareiAfars’mon, E.H. no. 18 (1983) (arguing that divorce against a woman’s will should not be permittedeven to fulfill the commandment of procreation as not to hurt his wife)) and 41R (citing Hayyim Ye-hudah Lev, Responsa Sha’arei Deah, No. 117 (arguing that divorcing one’s wife against one’s willwould be a violation of wronging another)). Therefore, there is precedent for arguing that the com-mandment is not absolute and that the honor and effect to the third-party woman should be consid-ered.231. Id.232. See GOLD, supra note 205, at 153.233. See Genesis 15:2-3, wherein Abraham appoints his servant Eliezer as his legal heir in absenceof a natural heir; B. Talmud Sanhedrin 19b (discussing various places in The Bible where a child israised by another family and is thus considered to be the son of the parents’ who raised him). How-ever, in none of these cases is the biological link severed nor an adoption arranged; rather, the addi-tional parental relationship results from the de facto care of the child.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 123these de facto arrangements, adoption as a legal institution is not acknowledgedin Jewish law. Adoption in scripture was informally arranged because a childwas orphaned and needed the help of others.234 Similarly, this de facto arrange-ment would be carried out when parents had no heirs and therefore grantedtheir possessions as inheritance to an “adopted” child.235 When a child isadopted de facto, the adoptive parents give him her name and identity.236The importance of biological lineage in Jewish law explains the absence ofadoption as a legal procedure in Jewish law.237 Jewish law places great impor-tance on a child’s biological identity and status. It is birth that establishes thelineage and status of the child; who he can marry, the laws of inheritance, obli-gations to parents, etc.238 Such identity is permanent and cannot be changed by alegal procedure such as adoption. The transferring of the status of children isnot part of the Jewish legal system, not for adoption and therefore is not a natu-ral concept to be used for surrogate motherhood either.Adoption as a legal procedure was first established in Justinian RomanLaw, where establishing heirs were very important and little emphasis wasplaced on bloodlines.239 In contrast, the English common law system did not ac-knowledge adoption.240 English common law, like Jewish law, placed such astrong emphasis on bloodlines for inheritance and property titles that adoptionwas forbidden in England.241 Informal adoption was common, but adoptivechildren were left in a legal limbo under the common law.242Due to the Israeli legislature’s putative desire to accommodate Jewish lawin adoption proceedings, among other laws, the Surrogate Motherhood Agree-ments Law is the one and only case of transferred parental identity in Israelilaw, if one considers the gestational mother the legal mother.243 Therefore, forthose Jewish legal theorists who believe that the gestational mother is the legalmother of the child, the Israeli law is a unique deviation from the norms of Jew-ish law.234. See Esther 2:7 (“He [Mordechai] was foster father to Hadassah – Esther—his uncle’s daugh-ter, for she had neither father nor mother.”).235.

In recognition of the Jewish law, and unlike the Surrogate Agreements Law, the Israeliadoption law transfers only the obligations of custody to the adoptive parents, creating a synthesisbetween the common law system and the Roman system. Careful records are kept for the sake ofpersonal status, inheritance laws and marriage eligibility. See Israel Adoption Law, 1996 A.G. 21 §29. See Mordechai Halperin, Protocol 3 of the Public Professional Committee to Decipher the Case ofEgg Donations (May 17, 2000) (unpublished, on file with the author).LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PM124 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 9:91 2002In the sole minority opinion of the Aloni Commission Report, Dr. Halperinincludes in his recommendation for surrogacy contracts a formal adoption pro-cedure in compliance with Israeli Adoption Law (1981). He concedes that itwould be an expedited procedure because it is an adoption between family re-lations, as the intended father is also the legal father.244 However, as in keepingwith the Jewish law understanding of the establishment of motherhood, a for-mal adoption procedure would have to be undertaken.There is precedent in Jewish law that can be used as a foundation for theadoption relationship. The concept of an apotropos, (legal guardian), who has le-gal responsibility for the child and legal authority over the property of the minoris discussed in The Talmud.245 However, the child maintains his biological iden-tity and natural rights and responsibilities as pertain to the child of natural par-ents. This apotropos is similar to the formulation of the adoptive parent providedin the Israeli adoption law, except that adoption is arranged in advance as op-posed to a de facto apotropos. Since rabbinic authorities have already acceptedthis form of adoption, and since similar arrangements were valid under Jewishlaw, there is room for rabbinic authorities to insist that adoption occur in thegestational surrogate motherhood. Such insistence would validate the surrogatemother’s status and give her the leverage of having to agree to the transfer uponthe child’s birth, which would go far to prevent exploitation and violation of herstatus and rights as the natural mother.C. Custody as a Function of Duty as opposed to RightsAn important element of these surrogacy agreements is that regardless ofthe identity of the mother, the father also has claims to the child. Ultimately,even if the surrogate mother is considered the legal mother, it remains to be de-termined who has custody of the child.The significance of the issue of custody was demonstrated in the case of Inre Baby M.246 In Baby M, Mary Beth Whitehead, a married mother of two, agreedto be artificially inseminated with the sperm of William Stern, and to give up thechild to him for a fee of $10, 000.247 Three days after the baby was born, Mrs.Whitehead gave the baby to the Sterns. Mrs. Whitehead then changed her mindabout the baby, convinced the Sterns to return the baby to her temporarily, andthen ultimately informed the Sterns that she had decided to keep the child. Af-ter a long and bitter dispute between Mrs. Whitehead and the Sterns, the caseended up in court. The trial court determined that the surrogacy contract wasvalid and that the child therefore should be given to the Sterns.248 The decisionwas appealed to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which determined unani-mously that the surrogacy contract was invalid and that Mrs. Whitehead wasthe legal mother and therefore retained parental rights as the child’s legalmother.249244.

As between parents, both parents have standing to as-sert their rights to the child and have rights to visitation.252In Jewish law the issue is complicated by the ethical elements that a relig-ious legal system entails. Moshe Silberg, a former associate Justice of the Su-preme Court of Israel, gave a paper that stresses the dichotomy between rightsand duties in Jewish law.253 Silberg writes, “[I]n Jewish law it is very difficult tomark the border between the utilitarian and the moral considerations of the leg-islator and determine the nature of the res which a certain provision of the lawseeks to protect.”254 He discusses the inextricable relationship of law and moralsin Jewish law; the law itself does not only order relationships between man andman but also between man and God. The system in its entirety is religious inorigin and therefore involves obligations to God.In order to demonstrate this thesis he asks the question, “Why should aman pay his debt or fulfill an obligation which he has undertaken?”255 Secularjurists would presumably respond that the obligation corresponds with the rightof an individual to hold property. However, in Jewish law the issue is morecomplicated. There is a disagreement as to whether the payment of an obliga-tion is a civil legal duty owed to the second party stemming from the right tohold property, or whether it is a religious moral duty requiring the debtor to re-pay his debt. The Talmud states, “The paying of the debt is a precept [religiousduty] and minors are not obliged to fulfill the precepts.”256 The consequence ofthis determination is that when a person refuses to pay his debt, “he is physi-cally coerced to fulfill his religious obligation to pay.”257 Silberg relates, “The250.

Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942)(holding that the right to conceive and raise one’s own children is among the “basic civil rights ofman.”)252. Only in exceptional cases are visitation rights of biological parents not granted. See, e.g.,Kemp v. Kemp, 399 A.2d 923, 927-28 (Md. App. 1979) (stating that visitation rights would be deniedonly where any interaction with a parent would be “so detrimental to the child as seriously to en-danger his well-being”). This distinction between duties and rights is also present in the area of pro-creation, whereas in Judaism there is an obligation to procreate; in the U.S. there is a right to procre-ate.

Thecreditor receives his money incidentally, as a secondary result of the perform-ance of this duty.”258 Silberg stresses the emphasis on duty as opposed to rights,and the indelible place the concept of duty has in Jewish law.Likewise, the matter of the custody of a child is primarily a duty ratherthan a right, governed by the principle of the child’s best interests.259 The over-riding principle is that the parents have only duties while the children haverights to have their custody determined on the basis of their best interests. Aparent is allowed to sue for custody, but not by asserting her rights, only basedon the child’s interests, regardless of any prior custody agreements.260Michael Broyde writes that although Rabbinic discussions on surrogatemotherhood have centered on the definition of the legal mother for various rit-ual obligations, he argues that these ritual issues tend not to be the crucial onesto the couple or surrogate mother seeking such children.261 He argues that whenmaternal identity is legally in doubt or in dispute and paternal identity is estab-lished, maternal custody should be granted to the wife of the father regardless ofwho is determined to be the legal mother under Jewish law.262 He offers two ba-sic rationales for this determination.263First, the obligation to financially support children is assigned only tomen.264 Upon analysis of Rabbi Asher’s decisions on custody, Michael Broydestates that he adopts the theory that the father is the presumptive custodial par-ent of his children.265 The presumption of paternal custody is based on the fa-ther’s obligations to support the child and his rights as a natural parent, subject258.

Aderet (Rashba), is that child custody shouldbe determined according to the best interests of the child.267 Given the reality insurrogate motherhood that the intended parents are those of greater means andhave initiated the conception of the child, Broyde argues that it would almostalways be in the child’s best interest for the intended parents to have custody.This analysis might support the Surrogate Agreements Law, which presump-tively gives custody to the intended parents, but which can be overturned if thesurrogate mother can show significant change in circumstances.While the basic principles stated by Broyde above may be substantialenough to always lead Rabbinical figures to give custody of the child to the fa-ther, it should be pointed out that the presumptions of the Talmud are that un-der certain situations the legal mother would have sole custody of the child. TheTalmud embraces three rules that generally govern child custody, which areadjusted according to factual findings of best interests of the child.268 First, cus-tody of all children under the age of six is to be given to the mother; second,custody of boys over the age of six is to be given to the father; and third, custodyof girls over the age of six is to be given to the mother.269Broyde’s claim that the best interests of the child will always be with theintended parents is controversial from an empirical perspective and under-mined by the Talmudic presumptions.270 In many instances, it would be reason-able to argue that a mother’s care is more important than a father’s means orvice versa. Presuming that the father is the better parent because the womanengaged in surrogate motherhood agreements only serves to further denigratethe woman who took part in the agreement.271Therefore, despite the fact that the duty for childcare lies with the fatherand that custody is a matter of duty and not right, the mother does have a validclaim that the best interest of her child is to be raised with her. At the very least,there is room for discussion and factual findings on the matter in a RabbinicalCourt, as opposed to an unquestioned delegation of custody to the father.D.

How-ever, none of these principles provides a definitive justification for overridingthe surrogate mother’s legal status. Allowing the waiver of familial status inJewish law is unprecedented and seems worthy of some formal pronouncementor explanation. Jewish law should at least provide that a gestational surrogatemother be afforded some protection, either by establishing an obligatory adop-tion procedure after the child is born, in which the mother can freely waive herparental duties and rights, or, alternately, by granting the gestational mother acustody hearing in accordance with the dictates of Jewish law, if she so desires.Furthermore, due to the abrogation of the birth mother’s status, it might also bereasonable for Jewish law to outlaw these surrogate contracts altogether.V. FROM GENDER DIFFERENCE AND GENDER NEUTRALITY TO PATRIARCHYThe majority opinion in Jewish law is that gestation is the defining charac-teristic of motherhood. Defining motherhood by that which is unique to moth-ers, as discussed by Rabbi Engel,272 and more explicitly by Rabbi Bick,273 is basedon the Jewish law recognition of differences between men and women.Gender difference in Jewish law is founded upon the biblical passage inGenesis: “And the Lord God said, it is not good that Adam is alone, let Me makefor him a helper opposite him (ezer ke-negdo).”274 This biblical passage points tothe differences between men and women—they are not both just humans butcomplements to one another.275A basic legal distinction is made between men and women: positive com-mandments whose performance is limited to a specific time are binding only onmen, whereas positive commandments not limited to a specific time of perform-ance are binding on both women and men.276 There are many reasons providedfor this legal doctrine,277 the most cogent of which is that the respective roles of272. See supra notes 149-45 and accompanying text.273. See supra notes 157-63.274. Genesis 2:18. There is much discussion as to the meaning of the phrase “ezer ke negdo,” liter-ally a helper opposite him, or against him. Rashi contends that the phrase alludes to two potentialrelationships: “If he is meritorious, she will be a help; if he is not meritorious [she will be] againsthim to fight.” Rashi to Genesis 2:18. An interpretation that better fits with the flow of the text is tounderstand ‘opposite him’ as next to or beside him.275. See AVRAHAM WEISS, WOMEN AT PRAYER 1-12 (1990).276. See B. Talmud, Kiddushin 29(a). There are numerous exceptions to this rule. Rabbi SaulBerman’s analysis of the laws women are exempt from reveals that the number of commandmentswhich are exceptions to his rule is greater than the number following the rule. Saul Berman, TheStatus of Women in Halakhic Judaism, 14 TRADITION no. 2, 5-28 (1973).277. One reason offered is that because a woman is obligated to fulfill the needs of her husband,she is not mandated to perform obligations fixed by time because it would create conflict betweenher duties to her husband and her duties to God (Sefer Abudarham ha-Shalem, Seder Tefillot she Hol, Ha-sh’ar ha Shelishi, Birkhot ha-Mitzvot). See Weiss, supra note 275, at 5-6. But see Akedat Yizhak to Genesis30:1-2 (citing, in English, Nehama Leibowitz, STUDIES IN THE BOOK OF GENESIS 334 (1990) (arguingthat a woman’s obligations to her husband are only secondary to her obligations to God)). RabbiAharon Solobveichick maintains that women are exempt from some positive commandments fixedby time since they are intrinsically aware—by virtue of their innate spiritual superiority—of theLAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 129men and women are considered to be distinct.278 Women are primarily obligatedto fulfill laws pertaining to private Jewish ritual, centered in the home, whilemen are obligated to fulfill and maintain the public performance of Jewish rit-ual. This understanding of role differentiation is based on the verse, “The king’sdaughter is all glorious within. . .”279 Since different roles are attributed to thetwo genders in Jewish law, extending this difference to the area of motherhoodis a natural progression. It is consistent with the underlying principles of Jewishlaw that motherhood is established in a manner distinct from fatherhood.280In Jewish law, the recognition of gender difference leads to a finding thatgestation, the distinctly feminine aspect of motherhood, is the defining charac-teristic of motherhood. In Jewish law there is no suspicion of treating gender asa reason for difference as there is in the U.S. under equal protection analysis.The tendency to regard genders differently need not be negative (althoughit often accounts for too much); it could lead to valuing and protecting those as-pects of womanhood, such as gestation, that are simply different. The emphasison gender difference in Jewish law could potentially serve as a solid platform toprotect surrogate mothers by giving credence to the importance of pregnancyand childbearing, the biological domain of women. Providing the gestationalmother substantive legal protection against the fear of financial exploitation and,at least, granting her the ability to withdraw from the contract if she feels shedoes not want to surrender the child she has carried for nine months, wouldhonor the status of motherhood in Judaism by elevating it above the level ofcontract.However, Jewish law’s sensitivity to gender difference is not neutral. It ispatriarchal in that men occupy a dominant position in its interpretation and ap-plication. It is not only the spheres of influence that are separated in Jewish law.The basic familial structure is not based only on role differentiation; it is also hi-erarchical. The man is the leader of the household and has significant powerand control over the women and children in his family. The obligation to havechildren, the importance of seed and heritage, the duties of support and therights of custody, as well as the laws of inheritance, all lie with the male and hisprogeny.281This hierarchical structure is demonstrated forcefully in the differentweight that is placed on the status of motherhood and fatherhood in Jewish law.The asymmetry of the sexes under Jewish law is clearly highlighted in the ulti-mate rejection of overriding paternity in the case of artificial insemination bydonor (AID). AID raises similar problems of Jewish law to surrogate mother-hood. In Jewish law, the child of a woman inseminated by AID is considered tobe the biological child of that woman and the sperm donor.282 The question ofmessage these laws convey.

One is the fear ofmamzerut, which has been rejected by the majority of rabbinic authorities as ir-relevant in AID.285 Another is the importance of preserving the lineage of thechild, also a factor in surrogate motherhood, which is ultimately dispositive inmost of the strong objections to this procedure by rabbinic authorities.286 A thirdis the fear that such an arrangement would alienate the husband, who wouldhave to raise another man’s child in his home.287The Rabbinical courts in Israel have not sanctioned artificial insemination.In fact, they have found the wife’s use of AID to be legitimate grounds for di-vorce.288 As one Israeli commentator noted, “Whereas according to the secularoutlook, the desire to help the childless couple to build a family is the primaryconcern, the Religious Court goes to great lengths to discourage the couple fromadopting this path, e.g., by declaring the wife a quasi-adulteress.”289 Most sig-283.

See id. As Rabbi Waldenberg summarizes, “It is forbidden to fertilize a married womanwith the seed of another man by means of artificial insemination; such a deed is a great abominationand very evil. Indeed, some tend towards the view that a married woman who does so is even for-bidden to her husband.” Waldenberg IX, supra note 283, at no. 51:4(2). But see Rabbi Moses Fein-stein, Responsa Iggerot Moshe, EH #71 (1959) (allowing AID with the sperm of a non-Jewish man butonly with the consent of the husband).285. The concern is that mixing a married woman’s egg with a man’s seed would be an act ofadultery causing the labeling of the child as illegitimate. However, the majority of sources have heldthat it is the act of intercourse and not the mixing of seeds that causes illegitimacy in children. SeeMENACHEM ELON, JEWISH LAW CASES AND MATERIALS 626 (1999) (citing Bayit Hasash to Tur YD ch.195); Moses Feinstein, Responsa Iggerot Moshe, II:11 (1962) (explaining that AID does not constituteprohibited intercourse and thus there is no fear of mamzerut); Avraham Shteinberg, ENCYCLOPEDIAOF JEWISH MEDICAL ETHICS I:154 (1991) (“[T]he majority of the decisors reason that the violation ofadultery is in the physical act of sexual intercourse and its enjoyment.”).286.

The court determined that even when the husband encour-ages the wife to undergo artificial insemination from a donor who is not her husband, he is exemptfrom maintenance of the child, “and even though he acted improperly, in any case she too is heldresponsible for her actions, and she ought to have objected to his suggestion that she undergo artifi-cial insemination from a donor, thus causing an outrage in Israel.” Id. Rabbi Yosef determined thatno child support was due to this child because he had no legitimate place in Israel.289. Shifman, supra note 288.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 131nificantly, despite decades of use in Israel, a national law has not been passed inIsrael to regulate AID due in part to significant objection to such a procedure bythe Jewish law authorities in Israel.290Paternity in Jewish law is an unshakeable status in which there are embed-ded many responsibilities and duties. Ultimately Jewish law does not exhibitthe same tolerance for overriding paternity as it has shown for overriding ma-ternity. It is distressing that the consideration for the importance of parentalstatus when applied to men leads rabbinical authorities to outlaw AID, andwhen applied to women is overridden by concern for men’s obligations and re-spect for men’s responsibilities. Motherhood and fatherhood are different, andtherefore it is legitimate to define them differently as they entail different proc-esses. However, both motherhood and fatherhood are essential biological de-terminations and are worthy of equal protection and recognition. The fact thatmotherhood can be overridden according to Jewish law authorities, while fa-therhood cannot, is cause for serious concern.Furthermore, Rabbi Goldberg’s rationale for overriding the status of moth-erhood—to allow men to fulfill their obligation to procreate—is disconcertingwhen viewed from a broader perspective. Given that the majority opinion inJewish law is that the surrogate is considered the legal mother, this reasoningsubjugates mothers to men for the purpose of providing children: exactly theway in which many have characterized the danger of surrogate motherhood.291While gender difference goes so far as to marginalize and alienate womenin Jewish law, U.S. law has not done enough to recognize physiological differ-ences in gender. U.S. courts have perceived gestational surrogates as little morethan wombs for rent and have not acknowledged the body of literature thatdemonstrates the considerable attachment and physical intimacy that developduring pregnancy.292 The actual effects of the gestational mother’s conduct onthe fetus and the real responsibility and influence the gestational mother has onthe fetus is also left unrecognized.293 In various U.S. jurisdictions, the applicationof gender difference to surrogate motherhood has been seriously challenged.One court has held, and a number of legal commentators have argued, that de-fining motherhood and fatherhood on the basis of different principles, i.e.,motherhood on gestation and fatherhood on genetic input, is a violation of the290. For a discussion of this matter, see Pinhas Shifman, Determining Fatherhood in a Child Born ofArtificial Insemination, 10 Mishpatim 197 (1980) (Hebrew, translated by the author); see also MichaelKorinaldi, The Legal Status of a Child Born of Artificial Means from a Sperm Donor or an Egg Donor, 18SHNATON MISHPAT HAIVRI 115 (1985).291.

Since women are unique in their childbearing capabili-ties, the equal protection clause should not dictate that gestation cannot be usedas a determinant of motherhood. The fact that a woman undergoes the processof pregnancy is a fact of nature and to recognize it is hardly a violation of theequal protection clause. Rather, ignoring this important feature of motherhoodin favor of sole consideration of genetic input or intention is to use male criteriato define motherhood, a female category. Thus, U.S. law, like Jewish law, is pa-triarchal in its sole use of male categories to define that which is inherently fe-male.Furthermore, the U.S. courts’ understanding of the concept of the naturalmother as a gender-neutral, objective person is misleading. Given that bothgestation and ovum donation are biological, natural contributions to the pro-duction of a child, it is perplexing to call the genetic mother the natural mother.Designating the intentional mother as the natural mother because she is the onewho wants the child is an even more confounded use of the term natural. Thefact is that nature is not gender-neutral, and to pick and choose the naturalmother based on that which is the male contribution of genes, or on a modernconcept of intent, is artificial. U.S. courts must either be more gendered in de-fining natural motherhood or ignore such an inquiry altogether and choose anew means of determination. But the artifice so far used by U.S. courts betraysthe concept of nature and the complexity of female reproduction.VI. CONCLUSIONSeparating gestation from genetics allows us to ask new questions aboutthe nature and defining characteristics of motherhood. Developing a legal re-sponse to such a question reveals much about the relevant legal framework. Inthe U.S., reproductive technology is viewed as a means to achieve the end ofhaving genetically-related children or, in egg donation, as a means of experi-encing a pregnancy which would otherwise not be possible. Due to this ap-proach, the U.S., on the whole, is inclined to define motherhood by intent or ge-netics and to permit the surrogate contract as long as there is some physiologicalconnection between the intended parents and their child.Jewish law is faced with a more ancient and less flexible legal structure,due to its self-identification as divinely ordained. Jewish law uses traditionalsources to try to determine a very elusive modern phenomenon, and in the caseof gestational surrogacy, arrives at a very different result than the more future-oriented, utilitarian secular systems of law.The U.S. legal system can learn a number of lessons from Jewish law. Theconcept of natural in Jewish law is much more rigid and well-defined. While theterm “natural” is tossed often used loosely in U.S. case law and policy papers,Jewish law has exact definitions of the meaning of natural, and such definitionscould help U.S. lawmakers and jurists to clarify what they mean by natural.294.

App. 1994); see, e.g., Schultz, supra note 8.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PMGESTATION: WORK FOR HIRE OR THE ESSENCE OF MOTHERHOOD? 133Specifically, it might serve as a lesson of when the concept of natural ought to beavoided or overridden when it reflects outdated concepts of the sacredness oflineage, impurity of seed, and paternal control of offspring. U.S. courts ought toconsider dismissing the notion of a single natural mother and being more honestabout the conceptual difficulties they are encountering, and the need for protec-tion for all who are parties to the artificial agreement of surrogate motherhood.In addition, when U.S. jurists use the concept of the natural mother, orwhen they simply look to designate a legal mother, they can look to a more tra-ditional system to understand the implications of such a status—namely the im-portance of gender difference and the separate roles of men and women in re-production. Such separation is a practical understanding of the importance thatgestation and child-rearing has traditionally played in women’s lives. Theseelements of a woman’s life must be recognized before the gestational mother’sstatus is completely marginalized in favor of the intended mother. The fact thatgestation determines motherhood in Jewish law may alert secular jurists to thetraditional importance placed on the act of giving birth and weaning a child. Toignore these feminine aspects of motherhood is patriarchal in that it uses malestandards for inherently female categories.The developed jurisprudence of surrogate motherhood in U.S. law pro-vides many insights into Jewish law. Most significantly, it emphasizes the ir-regularity of defining the gestational surrogate as the legal mother while allow-ing gestational surrogacy without any formal adoption proceeding ormandatory consent from the mother. In U.S. jurisprudence, which is more flexi-ble in defining motherhood, defining the mother has real consequences in termsof how feasible gestational surrogate motherhood is as a legal process. This dis-crepancy necessitates a more intense analysis of what makes Jewish legal theo-rists permit surrogate motherhood. Furthermore, contrasting Jewish law’s un-derstanding of contracts, reproduction, adoption and custody with U.S. law’sbasic theories of these legal and ethical issues reveals that which is significantand distinct about each system. The effects of these different theories have ledto different approaches to this complicated issue.Under Jewish law, the definition of the gestational mother as the legalmother might have afforded surrogate mothers a protected status in Judaism bydesignating gestational surrogates as legal mothers. This status could thereafterbe waived or asserted or, alternately, could lead to either the prohibition or un-attractiveness of the procedure as a whole. However, due to overarching con-siderations based on the dominant role of men in Jewish law, the push towardusing technology and creating children has overtaken even the important con-cept of status. The question is whether Judaism is being progressive in allowingcouples who cannot have children to simulate some process of natural child-bearing, or whether it is being overwhelmingly patriarchal, subsuming therights of women in order to allow men to fulfill their obligations. This articleargues that the latter is the underlying issue, because a similar procreative em-phasis has not been permitted in AID when it is fatherhood that would be over-ridden. Where similar considerations that lead rabbinic authorities to outlawAID to preserve the place of fatherhood are not used to dignify motherhood, thepicture of the society imbued is one in which, ultimately, children are importantas regards paternal lineage and motherhood is secondary in nature.LAUFER-UKELES_FMT.DOC 06/09/03 4:38 PM134 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 9:91 2002Ultimately, both the U.S. legal system and Jewish law approaches to gesta-tional surrogate motherhood are patriarchal in that they use male standards andmale interests to supercede female standards and interests. One might concludefrom this analysis that promoting any means of surrogate motherhood would bepatriarchal in that it ignores the gendered nature of pregnancy. However, this isnot necessarily the case. While the option of dual motherhood is not open toJewish law, it is a possibility for U.S. law.Even if, for policy reasons, having two mothers is considered dangerous,protecting the rights of both mothers by mandating adoption or withdrawalprocedures would not be dangerous. Undoubtedly, such provisions mightmake gestational surrogate motherhood less attractive for infertile couples.While it is likely that this would be the case, the utility of such contracts shouldnot override the fundamental rights of surrogate mothers. The promotion ofgestational surrogate motherhood can only avoid being patriarchal by taking se-riously the status and rights of the gestating mother.",
