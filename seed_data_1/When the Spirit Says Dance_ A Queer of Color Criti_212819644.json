MAHONEY* HEATHER BRYDIE HARRIS**  INTRODUCTION In a closed-door forum on July 11, 2017, United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions invoked Martin Luther King, Jr. in a speech given to and in support of the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), an anti-LGBT religious freedom group responsible for crafting many early anti-transgender bathroom bills.1 Employing King, Sessions parallels the ra-cial civil rights struggle of the past to the current “important work” of the ADF—by representing a divine moral right that he suggests be pro-tected by the state.2  Besides the personal criticism of Sessions’ civil rights record by Coretta Scott King when he was nominated for federal judgeship in 1986,3 Sessions’ deployment of King seems paradoxical on                                                           © 2019 Antron D.

MAHONEY & HARRIS  8 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 many levels. However, of particular interest to this study, is how Ses-sions’ rhetorical use of King forms a racialized fate-linking discursive logic. A logic predicated on religion that aligns the state and the Civil Rights Movement in a commemorative fashion to demonstrate a popular will for anti-LGBT policies and practices.    This racial framing raises questions about what Judith Butler de-scribes as democratic expressions of popular will— “[W]ho really are ‘the people’? And what operation of discursive power circumscribes ‘the people’ at any given moment, and for what purpose?”4 Never an all-inclusive or a given material reality of a population, Butler contends claims at “the people” are “a bid for hegemony” rooted in a performative field of power that always demarcates who are not “the people.”5 In this case, Sessions’ use of a racial justice discourse to frame the work of the ADF consigns queer people, specifically trans people, as those outside the boundaries of state recognition.  In the past two years, there has been proliferation of anti-transgender “bathroom bills” in the United States that discriminate against trans people, including students, by barring access to the use of appropriate facilities.6 In 2016, at least nineteen states considered anti-transgender bathroom bills, and in 2017, at least sixteen states consid-ered similar bills with at least twelve states proposing bills that specifi-cally address accommodations in public schools.7 To date, North Caro-lina is the only state to have enacted this type of legislation, and as of March 2017, the public restroom accommodation portion of the bill has been repealed.8 However, with the Trump administration rescinding Obama-era policy, which protected trans students and allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, it can be ex-pected that the propagation of these anti-transgender bills will continue in the foreseeable future.9                                                            4 JUDITH BUTLER, NOTES TOWARD A PERFORMATIVE THEORY OF ASSEMBLY 3 (2015) [hereinafter BUTLER, PERFORMATIVE THEORY OF ASSEMBLY]. 5 Id. at 3–4. 6 Joellen Kralik, “Bathroom Bill” Legislative Tracking, NAT’L CONF.

MAHONEY & HARRIS   2019] WHEN THE SPIRIT SAYS DANCE 9 Moreover, the use of racial justice framing, specifically invok-ing King, has become a popular discursive strategy by state actors and conservative evangelicals in attempting to garner multiracial support for bathroom bills.10 As such, we will analyze two case studies in which abstract memorializing rhetoric of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement is employed in the framing of anti-transgender bath-room legislation.11 Butler suggests for a more radical form of democ-racy, equality cannot be solely based on extension of recognition (which inevitably leaves a group out), perhaps instead, a change in the social relations between the recognizable and unrecognizable would ulti-mately change how we conceive “the people.”12    In order to uncover these relations of power and challenge the configurations between the recognizable and unrecognizable, we exam-ine a performance-in-resistance by black transwoman activist Micky Bradford in a public protest in opposition to anti-transgender legislation in North Carolina.13 This black queer embodied disposition constitutes a queer of color critique which centers the queer of color subject, re-vealing the often-obscured interconnected logics of race, gender, sexu-ality and class in cultural formations to map and remap the contours of power propagated by state forces.14 Through the spectacle of Bradford’s performance, we, as black queer scholars, conceptualize a queer womanist reading of King that undermines and reconstitutes the state’s logic of popular will.15   II.  ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLENCE A month before the incoming Trump administration would overturn Obama-era public school guidance on trans students, on January 5, 2017, Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick held a press conference to announce the filing of a new bill, the Texas Privacy Act.16                                                           10 See Alex Bollinger, Tennessee Introduces Bathroom Bill, Marriage Equality Ban, LGBTQ NATION (Feb. 10, 2017), https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2017/02/tennessee-introduces-bath-room-bill-marriage-equality-ban/; Kristina Marusic, Texas Politician Invokes MLK in An-nouncement of New Anti-Trans Bathroom Bill, LOGO NEWNOWNEXT (Jan. 5, 2017), http://www.newnownext.com/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-press-conference-privacy-protection-act-senate-bill-6-anti-trans-bathroom-bill/01/2017/. 11 See infra Part II. 12 BUTLER, PERFORMATIVE THEORY OF ASSEMBLY, supra note 4, at 5–6. 13 See infra Part III. 14 Id. 15 Id. 16 Press Conference: Lt.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 Authored by Republican State Senator Lois Kolkhorst, the bill requires that students use restrooms according to their, as the bill states, “biological sex”—by which they mean “the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate.”17 In May 2016, the Obama administration directed its Departments of Justice and Education’s civil rights divisions to issue a guidance to schools to not prohibit students from using bathrooms that matched their gender identity but may not align with the sex indicated on their birth certificate.18 Thus, under Title IX provisions, treating a student’s gender identity as their sex.19   This legal conception of sex as gender was a progressive stance taken throughout much of the Obama administration.20 The category of sex has been a contested ground in transgender anti-discrimination law.21 The (re)reading of sex as a protected class in federal law has been employed for transgender law reform, providing three distinctive read-ings of the category—sex as biology, sex as anatomy, and sex as gen-der—with the latter characterizing a still limiting but “an advance over prior approaches to anti-discrimination law concepts of sex in transgender contexts.”22 Limited by its propensity to reify binary gen-dered norms, nonetheless, sex as gender interpretations are not consti-tuted on anatomical considerations but on transgressive gendered be-havior, or as Alex Sharpe states, “gender performance replaces a concern with transgender ‘authenticity’ that characterizes prior anti-dis-crimination law reform jurisprudence.”23 Thus, during the Obama era,                                                           North Carolina’s Lead, Dan Patrick Unveils So-Called “Bathroom Bill”, TEXAS TRIBUNE (Jan. 5, 2017, 1:00 PM), https://www.texastribune.org/2017/01/05/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-unveils-so-called-bathroo/. 17 S.B. 6, 85th Leg., Reg.

MAHONEY & HARRIS   2019] WHEN THE SPIRIT SAYS DANCE 11 with push from trans advocate organizations and activists, similar inter-pretations of sex were implemented in the Social Security Administra-tion (SSA), removing the requirement of sex-confirmation surgery for changing the sex indicator on federal legal documents,24 and Equal Em-ployment Opportunity Commission protections, which ruled in 2012 that gender identity-based employment discrimination is “sex” discrim-ination violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.25  However, the Trump administration would not only overturn the Title IX Obama-era mandates in February 2017, but a year later, would go as far as to no longer investigate complaints filed by trans students who had been banned from restrooms that match their gender identity.26 These inconsistencies and possibilities in proscribing anti-discrimina-tion law to protect trans people highlight Dean Spade’s critical push for a trans politics that “move beyond the politics of recognition and inclu-sion,”27 as found in anti-discrimination/hate crime law, to focus on the administrative realm of governance.28 Administrative governance in-cludes the federal agencies, such as the SSA, and state agencies like departments of health, transportation, education, etc., that actually cre-ate and produce meaning for the category of sex.29 Laws and policies in the administrative realm can enact a form of trans violence through their rules that govern gender, whether that’s gender reclassification ID pol-icies, healthcare access, or sex-segregation of public institutions—these policies effect the security and vulnerability of trans populations.30 This has been especially true in the age of the “War on Terror” where an increased scrutiny of immigration and funding of United States milita-rism has led to an increase policing of national standardization of cate-gorizing gender, a “state-building project, a project that increases the                                                           24 NAT’L CTR.

Framing Race and Religion through Fate Lt. Governor Patrick’s public proclamation of a Texas “bath-room bill” can be seen as the initiation of the anti-trans insurgency to come.33 Patrick’s announcement would also set another precedent in the anti-trans political movement. It would be one of the first citations, or framing, of anti-trans policy and rhetoric with a black justice dis-course.34 Patrick opened the press conference with a quote from Martin Luther King, Jr. stating, “Martin Luther King said, ‘Our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter.’”35 Patrick goes on to say, “This legislation, the Texas Privacy Act . . . is unquestionably one of the things that matters. It’s the right thing to do. I know it. Texans know it. And Senator Kolkhorst knows it.”36  “Framing” is typically defined as methods of mobilization in which social actors discursively translate policy and social conditions while making meaning of their issue on a collective level.37 Framing can be employed by both progressive and conservative social movements in                                                           31 Dean Spade, Documenting Gender, 59 HASTINGS L.J. 731, 738 (2008) [hereinafter Spade, Documenting Gender]. 32 SPADE, NORMAL LIFE, supra note 27, at 74–75. 33 See Press Conference: Lt.

Governor Patrick’s opening statement, thus, constitutes an emotional fate-linking strategy, which as Sara Ahmed writes, “work[s] by aligning subjects with collectives by attributing ‘others’ as the ‘source’ of our feelings.”44 Here, through an affective moral plea in-voked in part by employing a King quote, support of the Texas Privacy Act is something “that matter[s]” to those who understand “rightness,” or specifically, “righteousness” given the religious context of King.45 The sentiment invites the listener to adopt “the one who knows and speaks,” constituting the “us” and the legitimate subjects of the state through an emotional fear of the illegitimate others—those in opposition to the bill—who threaten “our lives” with their “silence” and complicity with “immorality.”46 As such, privacy, as indicated in the bill’s title, is relegated to only the legitimate citizens of the state and constituted by the disclosure and surveillance of the “other.”47    Precisely, as used here, “our lives” signify the nation-state and the white cis-heteropatriarchy that constitutes its sovereign body.48 The recognition of unintelligible trans bodies, then, threaten to “end” our lives, or maybe reconstitute the state body and its hierarchies.49 Further-more, this narrative particularly invites people of color to the “collec-tive” with its invocation of King, and subsequently, the Civil Rights Movement—a period of recognition and inclusion of racial minority dif-ference into the national identity according to the configurations of the national body.50 Patrick’s use of this racial archive is in some ways                                                           43 Wadsworth, supra note 40, at 202, 206–09 (exploring the rhetorical fate-linking strategies used by both sides of California marriage equality battles). 44 SARA AHMED, THE CULTURAL POLITICS OF EMOTION 1 (2d ed. 2015). 45 See Press Conference: Lt.

Dur-ing the week of February 7, 2017, two bills were introduced in the Ten-nessee legislature by State Senator Mae Beavers and Representative Mark Pody aimed at restricting the rights of LGBT people.52 Senate Bill 752, labeled the Tennessee Natural Marriage Defense Act, contends that the state should only recognize marriage between one man and one woman,53 and thus, requires the state to ignore the Supreme Court deci-sion in Obergefell v. Hodges which outlawed discrimination against same-sex couples in marriage law.54  The other bill, Senate Bill 771, authorizes public schools and universities to “require that a student use student restroom and locker room facilities that are assigned for use by persons of the same sex as the sex indicated on the student’s original birth certificate.”55 Along with claiming that the Obergefell v. Hodges decision is “a lawless opinion with no basis in American law or his-tory,”56 the introduction of Senate Bill 752 invokes both Martin Luther King, Jr. as well as the 1857 Dred Scott57 decision in framing the anti-gay marriage legislation, having the ability to be framed in a way to appeal to multiracial coalitions of opposition.58                The Tennessee bills, as well as Texas Lt. Governor Patrick’s press conference, construct an interesting paradoxical alignment with race, gender and sexuality. Siobhan Somerville examines the historical deployment of race and sexuality at the turn of the twentieth century in the United States to illustrate how the demarcation of bodies as either “homosexual” or “heterosexual” correlated with the categorizing of bodies as “black” and “white.”59 In doing so, Somerville was able to                                                           https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_maga-zine_home/2014_vol_40/vol_40_no_1_50_years_later/history_racial_inclu-sion_color_blind_myth/ (discussing the changes in racial inclusion over the past fifty years). 51 See SPADE, NORMAL LIFE, supra note 27, at 43–44, 49. 52 Bollinger, supra note 10. 53 S.B. 0752, 110th Assemb.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 “connect the ideological work of race to the historical emergence of models of homo- and heterosexuality at the turn of the century.”60 Produced through state knowledge regimes, specifically framed by racist eugenic ideology, sexual deviance or “abnormality” was adopted as an indicator of racial degeneration, and as a result, a trans-historical logic of race and sexuality emerged.61 With this logic, progression or transgression of either race or gendered sexual norms is contingent on fixing, correspondingly, race or gendered sexuality to a stable or natural state.62 This logic is deployed within the framing of the Tennessee and Texas anti-LGBT legislation.  The Tennessee bills leverage racial progress to conceptualize heterosexuality and gender conformity as (bio)logical, or thus, natural-ized.63 The nine-page introduction to Senate Bill 752 makes mention of “natural” marriage or law approximately twenty-five times.64 In the bill’s framing, naturality is invoked as a means to challenge the Ober-gefell v. Hodges65 United States Supreme Court decision, such as stat-ing, “WHEREAS, the decision in Obergefell purporting to overturn nat-ural marriage flies in the face of reality, the created order, and the law of nature, just as if the Court were to claim authority to strike down the law of gravity or other natural laws.”66 This discourse works as a regu-latory idea in which over time it has produced a regulatory force for controlling the body through a compulsive heterosexuality.67 Therefore, when you take the Tennessee bills together, the anti-gay marriage bill and the bathroom bill, collectively, the heteronormativity of the mar-riage bill incites a cultural intelligible gender and sex binary—giving credence to the bathroom bill’s sex as assigned at birth or (bio)logical necessity.68  Hence, in a legislative sense, Sharpe contends, “the                                                           60 Id. at 7. 61 Id. 62 See JUDITH BUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE: FEMINISM AND THE SUBVERSION OF IDENTITY 8 (2007) [hereinafter BUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE] (“What sense does it make to extend representation to subjects who are constructed through the exclusion of those who fail to conform to unspoken normative requirements of the subject?”). 63 Bollinger, supra note 10.

Race, in part, be-comes necessary in this instance because the state is making a case against or to occlude the federal ruling, and therefore, needs precedence. Thus, historical legal cases in which social actors, or even states, have been defiant of the federal government on the basis of racial progress are employed in the framing of the bill.70 The introduction to SB752 states:  Whereas, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in his famous ‘Let-ter from a Birmingham Jail’ stated, ‘How does one de-termine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of har-mony with the moral law.’71 The introduction goes on to cite Wisconsin and other states’ nul-lification of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act72 and the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford73 United States Supreme Court decision.74 Going back to Somerville’s race/gendered sexuality logic, race is enacted here in a way in which racial progression is a discursive device hailed for the exclu-sion of nonnormative gendered sexualities.75  The Texas announcement enacts a similar, less explicit discursive scheme.76 As discussed previ-ously, the use of King and the moralistic racial justice rhetoric aligns racial progress and inclusion with the content of the bill—naturalizing its gendered effects. Both the Texas and Tennessee discourse produces a state-configured rendering of racial history in the United States that situate black political movements around ideas of national unity.77 This                                                           follow from sex and those in which the practices of desire do not ‘follow’ from either sex or gender.”). 69 SHARPE, supra note 21, at 141. 70 See S.B. 0752, 110th Assemb.

Constituting “The People” The Texas and Tennessee bills illustrate how anti-LGBT legis-lation can be framed racially (and religiously).78 This is particularly in-teresting in terms of performative collectives.79  The universalist discur-sive frames employed by state agents to promote these bills raise fundamental democratic questions of, “who are ‘the people?’” and “what is ‘popular will?’”80  Butler contends that whenever “the people” is invoked, whether implicitly or explicitly, the discourse works within a performative field of power where demarcations between legitimate and illegitimate citizens are made and inequalities and exclusions are reproduced.81  Butler argues that to make meaning of public assemblies and demonstrations, “we have to read such scenes not only in terms of the version of the people they explicitly set forth, but in relations of power by which they are enacted.”82 Recognizing the connection and distinction between linguistic and bodily performativity, thus establish-ing “the people” as a discursive and material field of struggle, Butler asserts, “The gathering signifies in excess of what is said, and that mode of signification is a concerted bodily enactment, a plural form of per-formativity.”83 As such, performative collectives are by no means rep-resentative of a given population but have the ability to reinforce or sub-vert systems of intelligibility and legitimacy.84    This “plural form of performativity”85 is especially evident in the gatherings in response to the Texas Privacy Act and the state’s fate-linking approach.86 On August 3, 2017, the Houston Chronicle reported more than 200 religious leaders from across Texas rallied at the State Capitol Building during a special legislative session in support of the                                                           78 See Press Conference: Lt.

Bill Owens, one of the rally speakers and leader of the Coalition of African American Pastors, claiming to have marched with Martin Luther King Jr., states, “I marched to be able to go to the school of my choice, to get a job that I was qualified for . . . I did not march one foot, one yard, one mile for men to go into women’s restrooms.”92 These sentiments are further fortified by conservative Christian rhetoric, as Dallas Pastor Stephen Broden contends “we are engaged in a spiritual warfare here” because opponents of the bill encourage “doctrines of de-mons.”93  The state fate-linking discourse, as articulated by Texas Lt. Gov-ernor Patrick, can be seen by this performative collective as a hege-monic device with material effects.94 The state’s power is consolidated by its ideological construction of “the people” through “the production of an interlocking system of ideas which persuades people of the right-ness of any given set of often contradictory ideas and perspectives.”95 Religion works as a mediator for this racial and heteronormative ideo-logical fate-linking process.96  The state-produced memorializing rhet-oric, then, constructs and affirms racial memories and collective identi-ties, thereby through citational acts, where particular bodies coalesce                                                           87 Id.; see also Associated Press, How the Texas ‘Bathroom Bill’ Keeps Faltering, L.A.

MAHONEY & HARRIS  20 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 under the state discursive regimes, conditioned by state knowledges and histories.97    Like the fate-linking operations Nancy Wadsworth found in the political battle over California’s Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot initiative to abolish same-sex marriage rights, anti-LGBT organizers formed mul-tiracial coalitions—often more effectively than their challengers—by relying on religion as a cultural connector between unlikely racial col-laborators.98  These coalitions are “superficial” or “short-term” because they rarely manifest in addressing anti-racist politics.99 Though the black male pastors reference the anti-racist work of the Civil Rights Movement, the alliances they have formed with Welch and other white conservative evangelicals will likely never work to address systemic racism.100 Furthermore, the race/gendered sexuality logic present in the framing of the bills erases queer people of color as it essentializes black-ness and employs a conservative religious metrics to ordain morality and il/legitimate subjectivity.101   The implications of such racial framing, building multiracial, or specifically in this case, black and white biracial coalitions in support of anti-transgender policies, raises questions about what Butler describes as “expressions of popular will”.102 As Butler states, “Who really are ‘the people’? And what operation of discursive power circumscribes ‘the people’ at any given moment, and for what purpose?”103 Indeed,                                                           97 See G.

MAHONEY & HARRIS   2019] WHEN THE SPIRIT SAYS DANCE 21 establishing who “the people” are is a strategic discursive act of garner-ing power and control, one in which race has come to play a significant role in the post-civil rights era.104 Particularly in conservative moments as outlined here, in a period of supposed “color-blindness”—a dominate ideology that claims the United States has rectified its tensions over the color line—the presence and inclusion of people of color has come to signify a claim at “the people.”105  In a sense, people of color are com-modified in the “discursive wager” to demarcate who are not “the peo-ple” (i.e., queer people).106 Therefore, as Butler states, “the act of de-limitation operates according to a performative form”107 in which the “full” recognition of people of color is constituted restrictively within national terms, reproducing inequality in their alignment with “the peo-ple.”108    As a result, these multiracial coalitions in opposition to trans rights must be called into question as to “whether such movements can be interpreted as true or promising examples of the popular will.”109 Furthermore, given the discursive logic we have examined here, we must ask what type of public assembly brings into view abject bodies, “one that asserts and instates the body in the midst of the political field, and which, in its expressive and signifying function, delivers a bodily demand for a more livable set of economic, social, and political condi-tions?”110  Hence, we are seeking an assembly that enacts a critical trans politics— “that is, a trans politics that demands more than legal recog-nition and inclusion, seeking instead to transform current logics of state, civil society security, and social equality.”111  C.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 operates as a complex, multidimensional force.113   Employing Michel Foucault’s biopower conceptualization of discipline of the body and regulation of population,114 Spade argues this framework is useful in tracing how life chances are disproportionately distributed through trans populations contact with administrative systems that promote certain forms of life over and against others.115   Spade goes on to adapt Foucault’s framework and define disci-plinary power as “how racism, transphobia, sexism, ableism, and hom-ophobia operate through the norms that produce ideas about types of people and proper ways to be.”116 The political intervention of bathroom bills and the fate-linking discursive techniques employed by the state respectively represent forms of population and disciplinary power. Taken together, Spade has found that support for population interven-tions like bathroom bills have relied on social and political mobilization through “racist and sexist images that construct ideas of ‘us’ and ‘them’—a national population that needs protection and constitute oth-ers who are cast as threats and drains to that population.”117 In the case of Texas, as we have discussed, this has meant making trans people a threat to “legitimate” citizens’ “privacy.”118    However, what’s unique about the Texas and Tennessee framing is that instead of relying on racialized-gendered imagery, they employ a state racial archival history—invoking a collective memory—through the predominate use of Martin Luther King, Jr. Roderick Ferguson out-lines how power reached a new configuration during the mid-twentieth century political uprisings in the United States.119 Here, the United States higher education system acted as an archival intermediary using state epistemic logics to reframe minoritized subjects.

And one also controls their experience, their knowledge of previous struggles…It’s vital to have possession of this memory, to control it, administer it, tell it what it must contain.132  As such, the state fate-linking discourse enacts a form of disciplinary power that conceals the state knowledge/power regimes and disseminate a neutralized commemoration of our racialized past.133 The ahistorical fate-linking practices of the state serve to bolster a contemporary colorblind ideology—one largely grounded in an abstract liberalism that decontextualizes racial inequality.134  This “new” racial ideology operates in part based on how blackness is defined through narrow conceptions of gender, sexuality, and religion.135 In this case, the interpellation of the state historico-political liberal discourse facilitates a conjoining of traditionally disparate racial and religious bodies predicated on the exclusion and erasure of queerness, particularly queer people of color.136                                                              129 Id. at 3. 130 See generally Terry & Shelby, supra note 128, at 3–5 (arguing that King is “uniquely vul-nerable to having the richness and complexity of his thought ignored”). 131 See LINDA ELDER ET AL., STUDENT GUIDE TO HISTORICAL THINKING, THINKER’S GUIDE LIBR. 1, 5 (2012). 132 Michel Foucault & Cahiers du Cinema, Film and Popular Memory: An Interview with Michel Foucault, 11 RADICAL PHIL. 24, 25–26 (Martin Jordin trans., 1975) (1974).    133 MICHEL FOUCAULT, THE FOUCAULT READER 204–05 (Paul Rabinow ed., 1984). 134 BONILLA-SILVA, supra note 105, at 100–04. 135 See COHEN, supra note 125, at 42. 136 Jafari S.

MAHONEY & HARRIS   2019] WHEN THE SPIRIT SAYS DANCE 25 As a result, this hegemonic ideology rests on complex interlock-ing systems of race, gender, sexuality, and religion.137 In essence, this state racial justice archival and framing—which we can think of as one form of state documentation—intersects with the state’s administrative function to do the “invisible work of naturalizing” gender classification through another form of state documentation—birth certificates via bathroom bills.138 Conceptually, we might consider the textual conjoin-ing of gender documentation with racial documentation in state fate-linking discourse as an amendment.139 Chandan Reddy conceptualizes amendments as a way to think about how state violence is formulated through race, sexuality, and United States globalism.140 Bathroom bills, and their racial justice framing, “modify and authorize the prior textual body, it is because only through their frames can the body continue to figure as meaningful.”141 In this fashion, the bathroom bill discourse amends the state archival of race because it is through a regulated gen-dered sexuality that race is absorbed and used by the state.142 In return, this amendment logic consolidates a state-building project of national standardization of gender that extends the reach of the state in the name of “privacy” and “security” of legitimate citizens while legitimizing vi-olence towards trans people.143 Therefore, to think about a performative collective that enacts a critical trans politics, it must destabilize the structural components of this amendment and its specific historical, po-litical, and epistemological alignment of race, gender, sexuality and re-ligion.144  III.

Instead of iden-tity driving critical interventions, the heterogeneous formations that make up the social drive critical interventions.”150 Thus, women and queer of color subjects reveal and reconceive the racialized, sexualized, and gendered configuration of the state racial archive, fate-linking rhet-oric and religious-based performative collectives.151    A queer of color critique, then, works on these social formations from within—employing the components of their very logic.152 As Fer-guson theorizes, as a critical intervention concerned with historical ma-terialism (i.e., social formations), a queer of color critique is predicated on disidentification.153 Citing José Muñoz’s theory of disidentification, Ferguson states:  If to disidentify means to ‘[recycle] and [rethink] en-coded meaning’ and ‘to use the code [of the majority] as raw material for representing a disempowered politics of positionality that has been rendered unthinkable by the dominate culture’…Queer of color analysis disidentifies with historical materialism to rethink its categories and how they might conceal the materiality of race, gender,                                                           146 Id. at 13. 147 See RODERICK A.

In this instance, to disidentify in no way means to discard.154 We see a queer of color critique as a way to re-envision the so-cial logic of state anti-transgender racial justice discourse and its per-formative collectives—thus, undermining the social relations that un-dergird their claims at “the people.”155   To disidentify with the state logic would be to disidentify with King. Or more specifically, how the state has archived King, to rethink the memorializing logic that employs religion to connote a naturalizing arrangement where race normalizes gender and sexuality.156 In the in-troduction to Disidentifications: Queers of Color and Performance of Politics, Muñoz illustrates the power of queer of color public perfor-mances to retrieve, and even reconceive, historical memory.157 While witnessing a disidentifying performance by lesbian Cuban and Puerto Rican-American artist, Marga Gomez, where she reenacts and reconfig-ures a stereotypical depiction of the first “lady homosexuals” she en-countered on a TV show as a child, Muñoz is rendered to a reflective state.158  Muñoz is able to recall similar childhood experiences, includ-ing seeing the show Gomez viewed and others like it and the feelings of terror, pleasure and desire in these early deviant depictions of the queer subject.159  However, after further research, Muñoz realizes that he had likely not seen the show Gomez re-depicted—the show aired eight years before he was born.160  Instructive here, is the ability of queer of color identity performances-in-difference to alter historical recollection to “offer the minoritarian subject a space to situate itself in history and thus seize social agency.”161 As we seek to theoretically reconfigure the his-torical logics of the state, it is only made possible through the practical survival strategy of public and counter-public performance of queer of color disidentification.162                                                           154 Id. 155 Id. at 3. 156 Id. at 2–4. 157 JOSÉ ESTEBAN MUÑOZ, DISIDENTIFICATIONS: QUEERS OF COLOR AND THE PERFORMANCE OF POLITICS 1–5 (1999). 158 Id. 159 Id. at 4. 160 Id. 161 Id. at 1.  162 Id.

Embodied Justice: A New Queer Womanist Logic If we are to disidentify with that state appropriated King to re-store the black queer body in our socio-historical consciousness, then we must first understand how queerness is situated in mainstream Chris-tian practices in the United States. Far from a separation of church and state, hegemonic religious-based values and ethics within the United States are closely intertwined with every branch of the public realm.163 Dominant expressions of Christianity infiltrate the way policy is con-structed and inform public notions of just and unjust and moral or im-moral.164 Policy is often constructed without interrogating and confront-ing the problematics within these moral perceptions.165 Queerness as a category of otherhood becomes trapped in this corrupt understanding of morality and emerges as a deviant subsection of an otherwise “right-eous” society.166 Therefore, queerness is treated as a thing that must be controlled in both the private and public realms for the continuation of a moral society and for the protection of its “legitimate” citizenry.167   Queer bodies, seen as a politico-religious issue, struggle to man-umit themselves from governmental control.168 This obscurement be-tween hegemonic Christian moral ethics and the artificially-secular realm of government, allow for there to be the simultaneous existence of hate crime legislation and anti-transgender policy formation.169 In other words, it allows for a society where it is considered immoral (and thus illegal) to actively injure the body of a queer person physically while considering it morally and politically acceptable to control that body and dictate where, when and how it may enter.170 The queer body is controlled physically, and the queer person is portrayed as a sexually                                                           163 Elizabeth Bernstein & Janet R.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 The Civil Rights Movement, with its emphasis on responsibility, or re-spectability politics, based on state normalizing logics predicated on race, gender, sexuality, and religion, effected the tolerance the black church, as a movement, had for queer people in general, including its own members.179 In part, this is because of the emphasis the Civil Rights Movement put on racial progress, irrespective of other supporting iden-tities.180 Bayard Rustin, the main organizer for the 1963 March on Washington, is perhaps the most now-well-known historical figure who was integral to the movement, but due to his sexuality, was often rele-gated.181 However, there have been others. Prophet Jones, a black queer minister who led one of the largest congregations in Detroit in the 1940s, had his congregation disbanded when the Civil Rights movement came to Detroit.182 At that point, civil rights leaders declared that Prophet Jones’ sexual perversions would hinder black peoples’ pursuit of full citizenship.183 The archiving of King by the state erases these queer black lives from the collective memory of the black liberation struggle as well as black religious life.184   The black church and the state have used King in not dissimilar ways.185 The black church defied the states harmful racial discourses while gaining power through assimilation within the hegemonic ethics of the state at large.186 In a theological sense, the black church has cor-roborated with the state archival of King.187 In general, King is symbol-ically referenced in the black church, but few black churches, back then and now, actually practice the type of radical black liberation theology                                                           179 See DOUGLAS, supra note 178 at 88–89 (explaining the pervasive homophobia that was and still is present in the Black community). 180 Id. at 89. 181 See JOHN D’EMILIO, THE LOST PROPHET: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF BAYARD RUSTIN 1–3 (2004) (introducing Bayard Rustin, an “enormous contribut[or]” to racial equality who has been ne-glected in history books because of his sexual orientation). 182 MARLON M.

Patrick Johnson highlights the complex relationship between black queer peo-ple and the black church.191 For many, the black church is a refuge from the racism experienced within daily life, yet for queer black people, the church as a source of hope falls short.192 The church must “name us and claim us if we are to obtain any liberation within our own communi-ties.”193 Black church doctrines are rooted in a theology of liberation yet have not, on any large scale, recognized the queer body as a site in need of liberation.194   Womanist theologians have worked to redeem black theologies of liberation to women and queer people by asserting new interpreta-tions of traditions and ideologies.195 Womanist theologians have done this through revising where possible, or calling out when necessary, practices that do not serve all black people and black women in partic-ular.196 Queer womanist theologian Pamela Lightsey writes, “to many, the black pervert is the most dangerous to the American ideal.

Shawn Copeland insists that the body makes visible what cannot be seen, it is the mediator between the public and private self.201 The body is the human sacrament and it is through embodiment that we experience freedom, “through engagement and communion with other embodied selves.”202 Copeland posits that the Christian church has forgotten the body of Jesus, the body with flesh, with genitals – with sexuality and gender.203 If the church remembered and saw the physical body of the historical Jesus as a signifier of the sacredness of sex, gender, and sexualities they would be able to ap-proach other bodies with compassion.204 This queer womanist theolo-gizing allows for the employment of a new logic.   Womanist theologians attempt to disrupt harmful gender-based doctrines, while not separating completely from, black liberation theol-ogy and black churches.205 The tendency for black church doctrines to preach a doctrine of containment when it comes to the body, has created a distrust of all bodies, but especially the bodies of those who the very-human-trinity of dominant religion, socially constructed moral systems, and empire have deemed deviant.206 Copeland purports that black church teachings that are based in queer-phobia “exposes us to the                                                           197 PAMELA R.

King, does not, or chooses not, to see the connection be-tween one form of racialized gender violence – fear of black men – and another - fear that transwomen are trying to cause harm through gender deceit.211 Black churches have served as change agents for their com-munities since their founding on issues of racism as well as poverty and other forms of exploitation.212 However, conservative black church leaders have largely remained silent on issues of gender and sexuality, or worse, have spoken in defense of patriarchy, cissexism, and queer/transphobia.213 While King drew connections between the inter-locking oppressions of racism, poverty, and war (i.e., “the triple evils”), he did not locate gender and sexuality regulation as integral to these evils;214 therefore, it is no wonder that church leaders who rely on a shared collective memory of King’s theological politics do not feel a need to address injustice based on gender and sexuality. Theologian Ka-ren Guth offers a feminist ethicist perspective on how to approach King’s apparent silence within his justice ministry.215 Guth advocates for a (re)reading of King in order to re-understand King’s political the-ology of non-violence as community building.216 According to Guth, at                                                           207 COPELAND, supra note 201, at 77. 208 Id. at 77–78. 209 Id. at 78–81. 210 Id. at 83–84. 211 Garber, supra note 187, at 106 (noting James H.

MAHONEY & HARRIS  34 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 the core of King’s understanding of the concept of agape, or divine love, was an active love that had the capacity to create community, sustain justice, and provoke self-love for those who have been dehumanized by oppression.217 It was this kind of love-in-action that fueled King’s po-litical theology.218   Guth highlights King’s commitment to the creative capacity of agape, and his belief in its ecclesiastical possibilities, where churches could become creative communities that hold community creating prac-tices as the goal of their political mission.219 This theological responsi-bility to divine love as expressed through relationality, creativity, and community formation was the full expression of an agapeic love - a love enacted.220 Guth defines King’s hermeneutical understanding of agape love as self-loving, reciprocal, and passionate; while identifying the cre-ative capacity of agape love as the center of King’s justice ministry.221 This was the foundation of his political ecclesiology: one that allows for imagining churches as divine co-creators of just communities.222   Guth finds that King’s articulations of agapeic love shares com-monalities with womanist theological thought.223 King’s vision reso-nates with the emphasis womanists place on relational community building, as well as a politics of love born out of creativity that is both divine – as co-creators with God - and learned through survival as op-pressed people.224 It is this commitment to creative community building, intersectional analysis, and love-in-action that is at odds with the appro-priation of his rhetoric for the purposes of limiting movement, margin-alizing, and regulating trans bodies.225 Furthermore, what is interesting here, is that King found the three systematic “evils” monstrous 226 not people of color, poor people, and victims of American imperial vio-lence.

In March of 2016, Micky Bradford, a black transwoman, tired from peacefully protesting outside of the then governor of North Carolina, Pat McCrory’s, mansion all day had a change of tactic.227 Bradford was protesting House Bill 2, more officially short-titled the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, which stated that transgender people have no legal right to use any public bathroom that does not coincide with the gender recorded on their birth certificate.228 The bill, which defines bi-ological sex as the physical condition of being male or female, also took away the rights previously held by individual cities in North Carolina to enforce their own standards and caused them to overturn any city-wide anti-discrimination policies that conflicted with House Bill 2.229 In May of 2016, former Governor Pat McCrory was sued by the United States Department of Justice, citing that House Bill 2 violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Violence Against Women Act.230 A year later, in March of 2017, the section of the bill pertaining to bathroom usage in publicly owned buildings was repealed and replaced with House Bill 142.231                                                            227 Jorge Rivas, A Beautiful Act of Resistance in the Face of a Terrible Law in North Carolina, SPLINTER NEWS (Mar. 25, 2016, 9:33 PM), https://splinternews.com/a-beautiful-act-of-re-sistance-in-the-face-of-a-terrible-1793855827. 228 H.B. 2, 2016 Leg., 2d Extra Sess.

The most I could do was dance away my anger, frustration, and sadness.”235 A video posted to social media, and later shared in an online article on Splinter News, depicts the moment of exhaustion turned protest dance.236  The video was taken at the end of the day and it is dark out, but the street lamps are on operating as stage lights.237 Bradford is flanked by uniformed police at both sides while several more are behind her and line the collective.238 The police are a somber and discordant contrast to the exuberance of the dance.239 The chanting and cheering of the crowd doxologize Bradford while dissociating from and un-recognizing the police.240 Bradford stated, “it’s important to see a black transwoman be unafraid of police and policing.”241  Bradford is seen wearing a mini dress and boots, her brown skin gleaming under the street lights, and she is dancing, although not just dancing.242 To be specific, Bradford is vogueing, or what Marlon Bailey might call new way vogueing with its mix of traditional African diasporic dance with house, hip-hop, and vo-cal chants.243 Vogueing was created by queer people from predomi-nately black and brown working-class communities and is performed at specialized balls.244                                                            232 McLaughlin, supra note 231. 233 Rivas, supra note 227. 234 Id. 235 Id.  236 Id. 237 Id. 238 Rivas, supra note 227. 239 Id. 240 Id. 241 Id. 242 Id. 243 BAILEY, supra note 182, at 174–75. 244 Amy Herzog & Joe Rollins, Editors’ Note: House Style, 41 WOMEN’S STUD.

MAHONEY & HARRIS   2019] WHEN THE SPIRIT SAYS DANCE 37  Ball culture includes vogueing, fashion -made, salvaged or oth-erwise obtained - performing with a focus on self-presentation, and be-longing to a ball house.245 For those, who for reasons of hetero/cissex-ism, racism and poverty who may have lost all or partial of their homes and communities, ball culture provides other-homes, other-mothers, and other ways of belonging.246  House ball culture participates in the per-formance of collective and individual sexual, gendered, and racialized identity amidst social and economic marginalization.247 All the while, participating in material culture which has long been a means of forming notions around citizenship -who belongs where and to whom do they belong.248 When Bradford began to vogue, she was doing more than just dancing after a long day of protesting. To vogue is to signify to home and to citizenship; it is a way to claim belonging through the use of coded language and performative significations.249 What might look like just dance to the police who are standing around is yet understood to those who can read this particular code as a form of claiming space and place, participating in an act of self-performance and identity dis-play, and ultimately experiencing rejuvenating joy while throwing shade.250   Micky Bradford is participating in what Johnson would identify as a “quare” performance-in-resistance.251 E. Patrick Johnson, utilizing the definitional style and formula created by Alice Walker in In Search of Our Mother’s Gardens in 1983, defines what it means to be quare, a black vernacular expression of queer.252 It is to be both black and queer.253 Quare is an LGBT black person who does not identify with the relationship between queer and whiteness as already assumed and natu-ralized.254 It is an intersectional reality that is always both queer and black, black and queer, and never just one or the other.255 “Quare,”                                                           245 Id. at 10. 246 Id. at 9–10. 247 BAILEY, supra note 182, at 4–5. 248 Id. 249 Id. at 89–91 (discussing how ballroom members “undertake a labor of kin to create an alter-native social and community sphere through a reformulation of kinship”). 250 Id. at 180. 251 Johnson, supra note 191, at 125. 252 Id.  253 Id.

MAHONEY & HARRIS  38 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 Johnson writes, “is to queer, as reading is to throwing shade.”256 Instead of the image of black transwomen as victim or predator, we see her dancing. The queering and coding of space is a transformational act as it is expressed through the body. Space is created through a series of actions by subjects; the queering of space through a performance-in-resistance by a marginalized “other”, offers a new, complex, and multi-dimensional interpretation of space.  In a performance-in-resistance, the body is being used to queer the space on its own terms. This is what we mean by a prophetic performative witnessing; the body is used as a dis-cursive method of re-remembering that is able to transport the spectator to a different space and time.257  Specifically, recalling and reconciling the paradoxical experience of the black queer subject in the black church, this performance, as Muñoz discovered, works within our own internal narratives of self-formation.258 It is an act of public reflexivity that can be both personally restorative and socially transformative. C.  Theory in the Flesh A theory in the flesh “means one where the physical realities of our lives – our skin, color, the land or concrete we grew up on, our sex-ual longings – all fuse to create a politic born out of necessity.”259 E. Patrick Johnson advances a theory in the flesh and emphasizes its ability to call out diversity within and among race, gender and sexuality while simultaneously accounting for how racism and classism affect how we experience and theorize the world.260 Theory is a “way of seeing that allows us to apprehend our world in different and potentially productive ways.”261 Theories in the flesh adjoin theory and practice through an embodied politic of resistance: this politic of resistance is manifest in vernacular traditions such as performance and verbal art.262 Movement – being able to move, literally in the body, despite, in resistance to, and through oppression – is a form of resistance. Embodied theory resists                                                           256 Id. 257 Johnson, supra note 191, at 141. 258 MUÑOZ, supra note 157, at 1–5. 259 THIS BRIDGE CALLED MY BACK: WRITINGS BY RADICAL WOMEN OF COLOR 19 (Cherríe Moraga & Gloría Anzaldúa eds., 4th ed. 2015). 260 Johnson, supra note 191, at 127. 261 Phillip Brian Harper, The Evidence of Felt Intuition: Minority Experience, Everday Life, and Critical Speculative Knowledge, in BLACK QUEER STUDIES: A CRITICAL ANTHOLOGY 106, 120 (E.

MAHONEY & HARRIS   2019] WHEN THE SPIRIT SAYS DANCE 39 restraints that are designed to control and limit the movement of subju-gated bodies.263     It is through embodiment, a fundamental criterion of a theory in the flesh, that liberatory practices can be grounded. King’s use of non-violence in the form of embodied action was an expression of agency which had transformative capabilities. Likewise, a performance as an act of protest and as an expression of justice has the transformative power of creating and coding space. Controlling images of the margin-alized through state semantic maneuvers and through stirring up of col-lective re-memory of the civil rights era can only go on as long as it is not disrupted and confronted by the actual body.   We can, then, read Micky Bradford’s performance-in-resistance as a disidentification with the contemporary memory of queer politics. Bradford’s defiant vogue in the face of state violence and surveillance harkens back to the roots of the radical queer politics of the 1960s and 1970s, what Spade calls the “bottle-throwing resistance to police brutal-ity and the claiming of queer sexual public space”264 that originated with Compton’s cafeteria and New York’s Stonewall riots and with groups like Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR).265 This type of radical queer politics, rooted in anti -imperial, -racist, -capitalist and -patriarchal politics, stands in deep contrast to the lesbian and gay poli-tics of today, whose primary focus is a conservative quest for inclusion and recognition in United States institutions through nonprofit profes-sionalization (not street organizing).    Further, Bradford’s performance-in-resistance signifies a “quar-ing” of the black charismatic patriarchal messianic leader trope pro-duced through hegemonic historical imagery associated with the Afri-can American civil rights struggle.266 Erica Edwards insists these tropes inform contemporary performative iterations of black leadership that:                                                           263 See Stephanie M.H.

EDWARDS, CHARISMA AND THE FICTIONS OF BLACK LEADERSHIP 6 (2012). MAHONEY & HARRIS  40 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:1 normalizes a charismatic aesthetic, a specific organiza-tion of symbolic elements that fabricate and produce po-litical authority that includes elements as banal as the po-dium; the positioning of the leader in front...or above the collective; the deployment of music to create a collective ethos of resistance and change; calling upon or silencing women to authorize masculine power; the habits of black sermonizing; and the call-and-response format of black improvisatory speech.267   Bradford’s performance simultaneously invests in and chal-lenges this trope by centering her black queer feminine body in a staging that typically leaves her absent.268 Though Bradford is the sole front-person, in a political context where black trans women are dispropor-tionately subjected to violence, “the act of performing . . . in public takes on ever multiplying significance.”269  Instead of a rhetorical sermon be-hind a podium or pulpit, she takes to the street to sermonize through provisional dance, with a call-and-response that ties the black church house to the black queer ball house.270 Undoubtedly, Bradford’s perfor-mance disidentifies the King figure emblematic of the black charismatic scenario, signifying a more grounded, democratic and gendered diverse historicity.   Bradford’s performance subverts the normative power structure conceptualized by the center and margins. If the body is the site of the trauma, the body must also be a site of ontological/epistemological power.271 Embodied critical praxis creates agency and is an act of pro-test which has the transformative power of creating forced audiences which subverts the typical and directional power of gaze – the direction in which one will be seen or not be seen. Queering public spaces into stages creates something capable of being and becoming diasporic, as in, able to expand and change, but consisting of a central core - a home and citizenship. When a performance by the marginalized creates an au-dience out of those who typically control the gaze, it borrows the power of gaze. It makes the powerful temporary observers of the societal dis-empowered. The marginalized are no longer gazed upon against their wishes but reclaim their own images. It creates an ontological Being – being seen as a form of radical quare aesthetics.  It brings the ball to the                                                           267 Id. at 19. 268 Rivas, supra note 227. 269 MUÑOZ, supra note 157, at 1. 270 Rivas, supra note 227.

MAHONEY & HARRIS   2019] WHEN THE SPIRIT SAYS DANCE 41 battlefield and places the ball within the same lineage as other per-formed resistance practices, such as the gospels and the blues.    Creative quare and theological imagination through performa-tive acts can resurrect and reclaim the body using stratagems of joy. Bodies that are rendered blurred, or less intelligible, can be made into focus through new representations that combat the negative images cre-ated by the authors of anti-trans policies. Black feminism birthed much of quare notions of praxis, which “At the heart of [B]lack feminist praxis is a push to make the lives of disappeared [B]lack women matter.”272  Performance as praxis is capable of enacting the Black womanist theo-logical practice of “going back to get” what we have lost. Thus, Brad-ford’s performance constitutes a counter-performative collective that re-stages our collective racial justice memory, and thus, undermines the state anti-transgender racial discourse and its fate-linking framework. The charismatic scenario illustrates how historical knowledge can be configured in the body—channeling the old to make sense of the new.273 This quare embodied performance, through this citational practice, re-constitutes the power and logics of these hegemonic narratives—dis-placing demarcations between the recognized and unrecognized. By conjuring up and recasting the radical queer politics and the black char-ismatic politics of the past, Bradford’s performance constructs a per-formative collective that employs the black queer body to create a con-tinuity between movements that are often recalled in isolated fashion to propagate assemblies predicated on the erasure of queer people of color. Put differently, Bradford’s performance reveals the fragility of the as-semblies produced around state discursive claims of popular will while assembling and signifying black trans bodies, “we are not disposa-ble.”274  CONCLUSION Although King has been distorted and rendered into extra-his-torical intelligibility to make it appear that both sides of the debate are suffering a civil rights injustice; it can easily be made obvious who re-ally suffers from anti-transgender policy formation and conservative discourses that create profane others/monsters out of trans persons.

I’m 26 and I fight everyday to one day live to see 35 which is the average age for a black transwoman in the south.”275 During the writing of the con-clusion of this article, 3 black trans women were brutally killed in Shreveport, Chicago and Philadelphia; that means, for 2018, as of now, there have been 19 trans lives forcefully ended; 13 of which have been black trans people.276   Continued acts of resistance are necessary even after anti-transgender bathroom bills fail. The bills themselves are dangerous, but even when they are not passed or sustained, ideological damage is done.277 This impacts policy as these harmful ideological forms con-struct and define the conceptual category of gender, as well as maintain false dichotomies between what is considered just or unjust politically; as well as what is moral or immoral ideologically; and profane or sacred theologically.278 The racial and religious framing of cissexist policies pit oppressions against one another, erasing the queer people of color central to liberation work before, during, and long after the civil rights movement.279   Understanding Micky Bradford’s performance-in-resistance as not only a political act, but a theological act is a hermeneutical-counter to the discursive maneuvers of conservative multi-racial coalitions that erase black trans persons from black theological memory.280 This re-reading allows for the body of black transwomen to be seen as pos-sessing spiritual agency, demarcating them from the illegitimate mon-ster or profane other and claiming them as part of the sacred legitimate. The discourse surrounding these bills inform our collective memory of the theological and political past; how we remember what we remember informs policy as it substantiates the way we frame political aims and agendas.
