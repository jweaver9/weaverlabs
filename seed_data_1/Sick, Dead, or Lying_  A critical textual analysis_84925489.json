I’d therefore like to take a moment to define these terms and \nhow they differ from each other, especially in relation to asexuality. \n \nLesbian women and gay men: When Larry Gross conducted his research on minority \nsexualities in the media in 1991, he specified that he was specifically discussing “lesbians and \ngay men (20).” Gross does not elaborate on or mention trans or bisexual identities, therefore, \nwhen analyzing Gross’ work, it’s not appropriate to substitute in any other term for the \npopulation he studied other than cis lesbian and gay men. \nLGBT: While some use this acronym to refer broadly to anyone who is non-heterosexual \nor transgender. I will use it to specifically refer members of the lesbian, gay bisexual and \ntransgender communities and their subcategories, but not asexual aromantic (ace acro) \nindividuals. I have chosen to do this because many studies and researchers focus specifically on \nthese four identity categories, and expanding the acronym to include queer or other identities in \nthis case would be inaccurate. In addition, there is conflict on many areas of the internet on \nwhether or not cis asexual aromantics should be allowed in the LGBT community, and therefore \nthis term must be specific to these identities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarks 3 \n \nIntroduction \n In 2012, the well-known television show House aired an episode called “Better Half.” In \nthe episode, a woman comes in who claims that she and her husband are asexual. Dr. James \nWilson (played by Robert Leonard) mentions the fact that one percent of the population \nidentifies as asexual before telling Dr. Gregory House (played by Hugh Laurie) about his patient. \nThe ever caustic House immediately makes a quip about the patient being a “giant pool of algae” \nand Wilson immediately responds with the statement that it’s “a valid sexual orientation.” \nHowever, House is not deterred, and bets Wilson $100 that he can find a medical reason why she \ndoesn’t want to have sex. Later, House is challenged on why he cares whether or not the patient \nis asexual and is told that he’ll just have to accept the fact she doesn’t want to have sex. Looking \nannoyed (although this is not unusual), House responds with the statement that “[sex] is a \nfundamental drive of our species, sex is healthy. Lots of people don’t have sex. The only people \nwho don’t want it are either are sick, dead, or lying (Better Half).” \nUltimately, the name of the show is meant to refer to the couple—specifically the \nwoman—but it could also just as well refer to the fact only half of the episode is worth watching. \nIf you stop watching this episode midway through, you might come away with the impression \nthat this is one of the few times that House might actually be wrong. Perhaps asexuality is a valid \nsexual orientation in 1% of the population, perhaps the couple actually are healthy, happy adults \nin a loving asexual relationship. Unfortunately, however, this is not the case, and in the end \nHouse is proven to be right all along. The woman’s husband, it turns out, was sick. He had a \nheretofore unknown brain tumor in his pituitary gland which was inhibiting his libido, and the \nwoman was lying, keeping her sexual desires hidden from her husband in order to remain with \nMarks 4 \n \nhim. House wins the $100, and the viewer is once again left with a sense of victory at the \nintuitiveness of House’s medical acuity. \nI’ve chosen to open this paper with this short snapshot from House because it so perfectly \nencapsulates everything that is wrong about the way asexuality is depicted in popular culture \ntoday. In many cases the narrative constructed around asexuality—that it’s a condition only of \nthe “sick, dead, or lying”—is often the only representation of asexuality most viewers ever \nwitness unless they intentionally seek out shows with asexual characters in them. Despite the \nrelative commonality of asexuality — one percent of the population identifies as asexual \n(“Prevalence and Associated Factors”)—as an identity, asexuality has had zero to almost no \nrepresentation in popular culture over the years, and the explicit, canonical representation that \ndoes exist mirrors the damaging and misleading narratives seen in House. \nOtherwise, for the most part, asexual characters exist solely in the realm of insinuations, \nsly remarks, and the imaginative sexual reconstructions of fanfiction—stories about popular \nfictional characters written by fans. Plenty of characters in pop culture have been assumed to be \nasexual, but have never explicitly confirmed as such. Therefore, what little media explicitly \ndisplays asexuality is extremely important to the development of asexuality as a legitimate \nidentity, both to asexual and non-asexual consumers. Because of asexuality’s “symbolic \nannihilation” (Gerbner & Signorelli) in popular culture, I will use this paper to study the \nrepresentation of asexuality in contemporary television and film. By discerning how an emerging \nsexual orientation is represented in popular culture, audiences can gain a greater understanding \nof how popular culture shapes perceptions of minority sexual identities.  \nMarks 5 \n \nHowever, before we begin an in-depth analysis of asexual representation in popular \nmedia, we need to take a moment to properly define asexuality and provide a breakdown of how \nit’s currently conceptualized by researchers. \nWhat is Asexuality? \nAs a concept, asexuality is very new to the scientific community, and fitting it into the \npreviously established framework of human behavior requires some “deep philosophical, ethical, \nhistorical and cultural debates” (Parente and Albuquerque 1). While Western society is sex \nnegative in many ways, some scholars have argued that “Western society also systematically \nprivileges sexual identifications, desires, and activities while marginalizing different forms of \nnonsexuality, to the detriment of asexually identified individuals (“And Now I’m Just Different” \n2).” Scholars have termed the phrase “sexualnormativity” (Chasin 719) and “compulsory \nsexuality” (Gupta 132) to describe the basic idea that in Western society, sexuality occupies a \nnormalized, privileged, and socially supported space, much in the way that heteronormativity \ndoes. Sexualnormativity creates a space where sexuality is invisible and inherent, a space that \nassumes people are “sexual unless otherwise specified (Chasin 719),” while asexuality must be \njustified and possibly treated clinically.  \nWithin this system, it’s assumed that for the most part sex is vital for healthy human \ndevelopment, a natural part of human existence that shapes our actions and social practices \n(Parente and Albuquerque). Even those with marginalized sexual desires operate under \nsexualnormativity—society views their sexuality as “wrong” or different—but still grants them \nsexual desire. Many classic principles are based on this notion of compulsory sexuality, such as \nAbraham Maslow’s 1943 theory of the Hierarchy of Basic Human Needs. Maslow placed sex at \nthe bottom of this hierarchy as a condition that must be met before serious psychological and \nMarks 6 \n \nphysiological growth could be accomplished. The natural conclusion to this placement is that 1) \nall humans have a basic desire for sex alongside and fairly equal to their desire for other basic \nnecessities such as air and water, and 2) the lack of fulfilment of that need negatively impacts a \nhuman’s life (Parente and Albuquerque). \nBecause sex and romance are usually inextricably linked in society, alongside the idea of \nsex being good or natural comes the idea of amatonormativity, or the “assumption that a central, \nexclusive, amorous relationship is normal for humans, in that it is a universally shared goal, and \nthat such a relationship is normative, in the sense that it should be aimed at in preference to other \nrelationship types (Brake 5).” With the prevalence of sexualnormativity and amatonormativity, \nit’s no wonder that asexuality took so long to be recognized among researchers and the general \npopulation. \nBecause it was through this framework that scientists studied human behavior for \ndecades, for most of its history, a lack of sexuality has been pathologized as a medical disorder \nor illness, much like how it was depicted in the House episode, or conversely praised as a \nreligious virtue like abstinence. However, it has only been viewed as a legitimate sexual \norientation by researchers very recently (Understanding Asexuality 87). In 1918, Ralph Werther, \none of the earliest transgender people to publish their own autobiography, described \n“anaphrodites,” or individuals who are “not suffused with adoration for any type of human,” and \nwho, “shudder violently at the very thought of any kind of association grounded on sex \ndifferences” (Werther 295). In line with the early pathologization of the lack of sex drive \nhowever, he went on to describe anaphroditism as “either an after-effect of an illness in \nchildhood or congenital.” In the middle of the 20th century, Alfred Kinsey conducted his famous \nsex studies, rating individuals on a scale from 0-6 according to their heterosexuality or \nMarks 7 \n \nhomosexuality. However, 1.5% of the population he studied were categorized in a group he \ncalled “X,” for people with “no socio-sexual contacts or reactions” (Kinsey et al. 636-59). \nInterestingly, modern research into asexual populations has uncovered a remarkably similar \npercentage to Kinsey’s results. In 2004 Bogaert examined a pre-existing 1994 probability sample \nsurvey of United Kingdom households for characteristics associated with asexuality. From this \ndata he concluded from that roughly 1% of U.K residents were asexual. To date, this is the most \ncomplete research that has been done into the prevalence of asexuality in society. \nToday however, asexuality is generally defined by researchers as individuals with “low \nor absent sexual desire or attractions, low or absent sexual behaviors, exclusively romantic non-\nsexual partnerships, or a combination of both absent sexual desires and behaviors (Prause and \nGraham 342). Asexuality Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), which claims to be the \nlargest online community of asexual individuals in the world, defines asexuality simply as “a \nperson who does not experience sexual attraction,” although many find that definition \nincomplete or lacking. Today, researchers and asexual people themselves view asexuality as a \nlegitimate sexual orientation, distinct from the conscious choice to be celibate as “unlike \ncelibacy, which people choose, asexuality is an intrinsic part of who we are” (AVEN). \nResearchers also define asexuality as distinct from a sexual desire dysfunction such as \nHypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (Brotto et al. 646-660; Hinderliter 167-178). \nHypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD), defined in the DSM-5 by the American \nPsychiatric Association as, “persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic \nthoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity.” While this definition may sound almost \nexactly like that of asexuality, the two are in fact very different. For a lack of sexual desire to be \nconsidered a medical disorder, the DSM-5 states it must cause “significant distress in the \nMarks 8 \n \nindividual.” Individuals who identify as asexual however rarely report distress with their \nsituation and are able to function within normal parameters in society (Brotto et al. 646-660) In \nfact, the DSM-5 includes a note that says if an individual’s low desire can be explained by their \nself-identification as an asexual, then a diagnosis of HSDD should not be made (American \nPsychiatric Association). \nI like Prause and Graham’s definition of asexuality because it makes it clear that \nasexuality exists on a wide spectrum with many possible combinations of sexual/romantic desire. \nIn fact, this spectrum is wider than most people might think. A significant percentage of \nasexuals—50% in one study—report masturbating and having sexual fantasies in the past month, \ncompared to 92% of sexual respondents (Yule 93). However, that same study also found that \n11% of asexual respondents reported their sexual fantasies did not involve other people \ncompared to the .5% of sexual respondents. This might seem surprising to some, but asexuals are \nasexual—not sexually dysfunctional—so asexual individuals still retain the capacity for physical \narousal such as erections or vaginal lubrication and can have similar libido levels to other sexual \npopulations. Given this, researchers speculate that masturbation among asexual individuals \noccurs for non-sexual reasons, such as tension release or as a means of getting to sleep (Yule 93), \nbut would still not be directed at anyone as they do not have a sexual attraction to any gender or \nsex (\"Toward a Conceptual Understanding\" 241). Because of this, many researchers are careful \nto only define asexuality as a lack of sexual attraction to other people, not necessarily a lack of \nsexual behavior or desire in general. \nPrause and Graham’s definitions also draws a distinction between sexuality and romance. \nWhile there are times when romance and sex are seen as separate, for the most part, in our \nsociety, it’s assumed that they are inextricably linked (Understanding Asexuality 11). However, \nMarks 9 \n \nsome theorists believe that although similar and often co-concurring, a desire for sex and a desire \nfor romance are completely separate entities (Fisher 4). So while asexuality is the absence of \nsexual desire for others, asexuals may still retain a desire for a romantic relationship and in fact, \nas many as 33% of self-identified asexuals are currently in long term cohabitations or marriages \n(“Toward a Conceptual Understanding” 242). AVEN also sums up this distinction between \nromance and sexuality as, “Asexual people have the same emotional needs as everybody else and \nare just as capable of forming intimate relationships.” Many in the asexual community have \ncreated terms to delineate where exactly on the asexual and aromantic spectrum (or a-spec) they \nfall, such as, “graysexual,” “demiromantic,” “biromantic,” and “demisexual,” among others. This \ndivision between sex and romance becomes important to my topic later on when I discuss the \ntelevision show Sirens, where two characters, one asexual and one sexual, enter into a \nrelationship. Ultimately, this is why I find Prause and Graham’s definition of asexuality to be \nuseful, because it allows for asexuality to exist on a spectrum, where asexual people are allowed \nto experience “low to absent levels of sexual desire or attraction… or a combination of both \nabsent sexual desires and behaviors,” without invalidating ace and aro individuals who might fall \non either end of the spectrum. \nThis thesis began with a review of scholarship surrounding the impact and representation \nof non-heteronormative sexuality in popular culture, before going into the history of asexuality \nand establishing a coherent definition of it. And now that asexuality has been adequately defined, \nI would like to turn to my analysis of asexuality in popular culture. I’ve chosen films and \ntelevision shows as the medium of my analysis because they are spaces where asexuality is \ndefined as part of the public discourse about sexualities and their place in social life. I will focus \nmy analysis on three works in particular, the television shows Bojack Horseman, Sirens, and the \nMarks 10 \n \nfilm the Olivia Experiment. Throughout and after my analysis of my main three works, I will \ntouch on ancillary works like House, which depict asexuality in a much more surface level way, \nand compare and contrast them to my main works. \n \nAsexuality and Popular Culture \nIn addition to being new to researchers, asexuality is also relatively new to popular \nculture and mainstream audiences. A quick analysis of Google trends for the search term \n“asexual” shows that over the past 10 years from 2004 to 2015, the term has more than doubled \nin popularity. Possibly the first online article mentioning asexuality was published in 1997 by \nStarNet (O’Reilly). In it, the author Zoe O’Reilly described her experiences living as an asexual \nperson, and her frustrations with finding any sort of information about her existence outside of \nbiology textbooks discussing asexuality in context of single cell organisms (O’Reilly). In 2000, a \nsmall Yahoo group called Haven for the Human Amoeba was founded and became the first \nonline community for asexuals. Eventually the Asexual Visibility and Education Network \n(AVEN) overtook the Yahoo group in popularity, establishing message boards so that asexual \nindividuals could communicate with each other, and slowly asexuality began to trickle into the \npublic consciousness (AVEN). In 2004, after Bogaert’s widely circulated study was published, a \nnumber of news outlets wrote on it. Stories from the New York Times and New York Magazine \nquickly followed, and the New Scientist wrote that “asexuality is indeed a form of sexual \norientation” (Westphal). Since then, asexuality has been a semi-regular topic on newsstands and \nmainstream blogs. \nMarks 11 \n \nToday, asexuality has, for the most part, entered the public consciousness: there are \nthousands of private and public blogs and databases dedicated to categorizing asexual \nindividuals’ experiences, and there are organizations similar to AVEN such as \nwhatisasexuality.com, asexualityarchive.com, or asexualadvice.tumblr.com, dedicated to \nanswering questions regarding asexuality and bringing asexual individuals together into a \ncommunity. There are asexual specific dating sites, and the popular dating site OK Cupid has an \noption to check asexual as an orientation. There’s also Asexual Awareness Week, and in the \ntradition of marginalized sexualities, an asexual pride flag. However, despite its rising popularity \nin scientific circles, and online communities, that rising popularity has not been translated into an \nincrease in asexual representation in films and television shows. \nAs such, there is almost no scholarly literature which explicitly looks at the media \nrepresentation of impact on asexuality. What little literature there is however does not focus \nspecifically on asexuality, but general themes of gender and sex throughout popular works such \nas Sherlock Holmes (Graham), and The Big Bang Theory (Farghaly and Leone). The research \nthat does exist on asexuality is, for the most part, concerned with defining it, separating it from \nmore medicalized definitions, or assessing its prevalence in society. Unfortunately therefore, the \nclosest we come is a general analysis of queer representation in popular culture. Although the \nways in which marginalized identities are represented in media vary, asexuality shares many \ncommon issues with other non-mainstream sexual identities, and by looking at works which \nanalyze LGBT representation, we can understand a little more of how asexuality has been \nrepresented historically, and how non-mainstream sexualities are represented in media.  \nAs I will demonstrate below, the existing research shows a longstanding struggle for non-\nnormative or queer sexualities to move out of the connotative bubble and escape symbolic \nMarks 12 \n \nannihilation and find authentic depictions of asexuality in popular media. As a recently named \nsexuality in popular culture, this is a perfect moment for examining how this sexuality is being \ninterpreted in the sparse mediums where it can be found. In order to study these representations, I \nwill conduct a critical textual analysis of three pop culture texts that feature canonically asexual \nmain characters where asexuality is discussed over a significant period of time: the Netflix \noriginal show Bojack Horseman, USA Network’s Sirens, and the independent comedy The \nOlivia Experiment. \nThrough my research I will be answering a range of questions such as, are characters \nsymbolically annihilated, represented, or trivialized in popular culture? Is asexuality framed \nmainly as an innate and accepted sexual identity, or is it attributed to disease and misfortune, as a \nmedical issue to be solved? Are the asexual representations authentic, do they resonate with \nasexual audiences, in a way that they are able to see themselves and their stories represented on \nscreen? Are stories of asexuality told from asexual characters and asexual actors, or are they told \nthrough another lens? And finally, through what narrative strategies is connotative ambiguity \nchallenged? In order to answer these questions, my method will involve an in-depth content \nanalysis of two television shows, and one film which feature asexual characters. The works will \nbe analyzed for content, theme, framing, presentation, impact, reception, and form. The method \nalso included an analysis of paratexts, or texts connected with the main media texts, such as \nonline fan comments, blogs, and newspaper and magazine articles about these shows and their \ncreators. \n \n \nMarks 13 \n \nLiterature Review \nIn his now classic work on gay and lesbian representation in media from 1991, Larry \nGross argues in “Out of the Mainstream: Sexual Minorities and the Mass Media” that the \ngendered social system is “supported by the mass media treatment of sexual minorities” and that \ndefinitions of what are “normal and “natural” roles for men and women only reinforce the \nheteronormative power hierarchy (26). He notes that in television, gays, lesbians and other \nsexual minorities are rarely visible. When they are represented, they are almost exclusively \nportrayed negatively as villains or other narrow stereotypes, or else they play supporting roles in \nwhich they help restore order to the gender hegemony. This process is what he terms “symbolic \nannihilation” (26), drawing on the work of George Gerbner and others, which he defines to mean \nthe underrepresentation or misrepresentation of a group of people based on their sex, race or \ngender. According to Gross, “Hardly ever shown in the media are just plain gay folks, used in \nroles which do not center on their deviance as a threat to the moral order which must be \ncountered through ridicule or physical violence” (65). \nSymbolic annihilation in the media isn’t unique to sexual identities and has occurred for \nmany marginalized groups of people in media over the years, including women and people of \ncolor (Gerbner & Signorelli). However, as Gross notes, in a visual medium like film or \ntelevision, sexuality is often more subtle than race, allowing television and film studios to code \nsexuality in a way which race cannot be. These codes alert audiences that the character being \nshown is gay through dress, speech patterns, arm or hand movements and other mannerisms, \nwhile still allowing the studios to officially deny dealing with the topic of sexuality. In 1993 \nAlexander Doty also focused on queer coding and connotation in media, stating that connotation \nis “notorious for its ability to suggest things without saying them for certain (Making Things \nMarks 14 \n \nPerfectly Queer, XI),” and allows straight culture to use queerness for pleasure and profit in \nmass culture without admitting to it. \nAlthough Gross and Doty focused on gay and lesbian characters specifically, variation of \nthese codes can easily apply to asexual characters as well. Most characters are not explicitly \ndescribed as asexual, but are instead coded that way through certain mannerisms, which I will \nexplain in more detail in the next section. A further issue arises, however, when you consider the \nway asexuality is often described—inaccurately—as an “absence” of a sexuality. This ‘absence’ \nleaves a lot of room for viewer interpretation of a character and has led to the rise of many \nasexual fandoms surrounding characters who are not explicitly asexual, but nevertheless do not \nexhibit sexual desire and therefore could be interpreted by viewers as being asexual. This \nespecially happens in children’s shows where sex and gender aren’t heavily discussed topics \nanyway, such as the Gems from the children’s show Stephen Universe. Alien beings with no set \nphysical form or human gender, they are often interpreted as metaphors for queer and asexual \nindividuals (Gretchen). This can often receive some negative reactions in fandom circles as fans \ncomplain that asexuals are “pushing” their sexuality onto straight characters, however, this just \nbetrays the extent which sexualnormativity invades our society, when even genderless, sexless \naliens are presumed straight, or at least sexual. \nWithout explicit representations of themselves in media, Gross noted that lesbian and gay \nmen must rely on their own personal experiences and those of others close to them, as well as the \n“narrow and negative stereotypes they encounter as being representative of gay people” (27). Of \nall the aspects of Gross’ analysis, this is the one that has changed most since 1991. While the \nconcept of symbolic annihilation may not be applicable to gay and lesbian characters today in the \nway Gross described, it’s very much relevant to today’s media’s portrayal of asexuality.  \nMarks 15 \n \nIn pre-internet 1991, Gross focused on the connotative meaning of gay and lesbian \nrepresentation in texts, and how the rare gay character portrait was “so subtle as to be readily \nmisunderstood by the innocent (Gross 31).” In 1993 when Doty wrote his book, he focused \nmainly on the connotative rather than denotative meaning of the media texts. That is, he focused \non the potential for straight appearing cultural works such as Lucy and Ethel, Jack Benny and \nRochester, and Laverne and Shirley (Raymond 99), to offer queer, subtextual readings. As \nRaymond wisely noted, as we move into more explicit portrayals of minority sexualities and \naway from the ambiguous connotations, a different analysis must be made that doesn’t rely on \nthe assumption that queerness will remain in the connotative closet forever (Dines & Humez, \n100). \nGross’ and Doty’s analysis seem to apply just as much, if not more, today given the near-\ninvisibility of canonically asexual people. The desire to find in the connotative aspects of \nrepresentations what is absent and unnamed spurred, with the rise of the internet, many young \nindividuals to search for their identity and find themselves represented online well before they \nsaw themselves in film or television. The internet has been perhaps the biggest tool in bringing \ntogether disparate and isolated LGBT communities, something especially true today for \nasexuality. AVEN, the largest community of asexuals in the world, is an online database that \nhouses thousands of pages of discussion threads, information, definitions, and links to asexuality \nin popular culture. However, despite its growing online presence, asexuality has not yet reached \na point in popular culture where anything near adequate or explicit representations of it exist. \nToday, the vast majority of explicitly asexual characters exist online in fanfiction, comics, or \nother self-created media. Thus while the lack of mainstream media featuring asexual characters \ncontinues to be a problem, because of online fan content, young asexual individuals looking to \nMarks 16 \n \nfind themselves no longer feel quite as alone. However, as with all media, the main responsibility \nfor producing it rests on the shoulders of the creators, not the audience, and young asexual \nviewers shouldn’t have to resort to making up their own additions to the work in order to see \nthemselves. \nIn general, representations of asexuality in modern media fall into the stereotypes and \ntropes that affected gay and lesbian portrayals several decades ago. The biggest issue is that the \nvast majority of asexual representation in media has not yet escaped that bubble of connotative \nambiguity. Most characters that could exist on the asexual spectrum do so through coded hints, \nclues and insinuations, not outright statements. For example, Sherlock Holmes, a classic literary \nfigure, has been transformed hundreds of times in radio, film and television, almost always as an \n“asexual-esque” character interested in only his work to the exclusion of all else. However, his \nsexuality, or lack thereof however, is never explicitly addressed. Sometimes portrayals of him \neven edge into a practice known as “queer-baiting,” whereby the show or film will insinuate \nthrough coded statements or gestures that Sherlock might not be straight, but never actually \nproduce that in the Sherlock movie or television canon (Valentine). \nWhen gay and lesbian characters were shown in film and television in the past, Gross \nwrites they were either portrayed as weak and silly, or evil and corrupt (30). Asexual characters \ntoday face a similar battle. The few times that a character is shown in television or film as being \nuninterested in sex (never explicitly asexual though), they are either a juvenile, child-like \ncharacter, assumed to be too innocent to know or care about sex, or as an evil villain whose life \nis too full of world domination to care about lowly pleasures. Another portrayal asexuality has in \ncommon with earlier days of gay and lesbians in film and television is the “broken” portrayal. In \nthis scenario, asexual characters are flawed or broken, oftentimes asexuality is shown as a result \nMarks 17 \n \nof a disease, brain injury or other trauma, and is introduced as a problem to solve. This can be \nseen as similar to processes of symbolic annihilation of gay and lesbian sexuality, where the \nsexual orientation is attributed to being the result of a fixable disease, or its pathologizing linkage \nto AIDS/HIV in the ’70s and ’80s. \nA fourth category that asexuality shares in common with early depictions of gay and \nlesbian characters is the dehumanization of it. To House, one of the only times someone can be \nasexual is if they are dead. In this case, we can also easily consider dead to be “not human.” The \nurge to procreate is often seen as a biological necessity, a natural instinct in human beings, \nplaced alongside food and water in Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. If one has no sex drive or \ndesire for sex, oftentimes the inevitable conclusion is that one is therefore not human. Oftentimes \nthe only individual not interested in sex in a film or television show is a robot, android, alien, or \nsome other inhuman creature. Look no further than the robot Data from Star Trek, the alien \nDoctor from Doctor Who, or the ever clinical and detached Sherlock Holmes who expresses very \nfew “innate” human emotions.  \nAs Raymond notes, in today’s media, when LGBT sexualities are actually shown, they \ntend to over-emphasize the innateness of sexuality and attraction, an odd over compensation that \nremoves much of the fluidity that is inherent to sexuality. In the television show Will and Grace, \nWill states that he has “always loved Grace, but that [I have] never had any sexual feelings of \nany kind for her.” Despite the fact Will has had sex with a woman, the viewer is given the \nimpression that Will can never have feelings for Grace because of his sexuality. In this \natmosphere, there is no possibility that Will could be bisexual, a sexuality oftentimes seen as \nfluid and unstable. In that sense, bisexuals share in common with asexuals, as Judith Butler \nMarks 18 \n \nstated, the media presumption that they are unthinkable and/or unnameable, not even subjects of \ndiscourse (1990), and still very much exist within the ambiguous/invisible connotative bubble. \nBecause naming is so vital to the representation of asexuality in the media, when \ndiscussing asexuality in media, it’s important to differentiate the various ways asexuality (and \nmarginalized sexualities in general) depicted and framed. Overall, my analysis of the various \nmedia will be broken down into three different categories, each focused on different aspects of \nnaming. Using research from Harry Benshoff and Sean Griffin, as well as Alexander Doty and \nJudith Butler, I’ve created three categories for identifying and placing asexual media in the \ncontext of naming, and will discuss how each work fits into the three categories.  \nCategory one is Canonical, which includes the three media which I’ll mainly be focusing \non. This category includes media where one or more characters are canonically asexual, where \neither they, or someone else names them as asexual. This category is based on Butler’s concept \nof performativity and naming. In her book Gender Trouble, Judith Butler places a great emphasis \non the role naming or failing to name plays in the development of social identities, and the link \nbetween unnamability and unthinkability (89). For Butler, “representation is extended only to \nwhat can be acknowledged as a subject.” For asexuality, the process of naming is perhaps even \nmore vital than other sexualities because for many characters in media whose character \ndevelopment or plot does not revolve around sex or romance, or who never express an explicit \ndesire or lack of desire for a gender, the only difference between an asexual character and a \ncharacter with another sexuality is the naming of asexuality. \nCategory two is Implied. As demonstrated by the GLAAD study, explicit representations \nof lesbian or gay characters are growing in television and film, however, unfortunately for \nasexual representation in media, the vast majority of it still remains implicit. Doty explored many \nMarks 19 \n \naspects of media which, although not explicitly queer, dealt with many issues, themes or \ncharacters that queer people identified with (45). Implicit is a category which looks at film and \ntelevision shows that deal with asexual themes, or where one or more characters are assumed to \nbe asexual by audiences, or whose sexuality is heavily implied but never explicitly confirmed, \nsuch as various film and television adaptions of Sherlock Holmes or the television series Pushing \nUp Daisies. Because the characters are not explicitly named as asexual, their sexual identity is \nbasically left up to audience interpretation. Benshoff and Griffin term this idea “reception,” and \nstate that a work does not necessarily have to explicitly name an identity for an audience to \nresonate with it. Instead, many works in our culture deal with an individual’s struggle with \nadversity, which, although not strictly a queer issue, has been picked up and championed by \nqueer advocates. Programs in this category include the Rocky Horror Picture Show, the Golden \nGirls, or Xena: Warrior Princess. \nCategory three is Word of God. The Word of God is a slang term used to describe \ninformation about a fictional work that comes from a source believed to be the ultimate authority \non the matter such as the author, producer, or director, rather than being defined by the audience \nas in the implied category. Benshoff and Griffin developed a category they termed “auteurs,” \nwhich looked not at the message the work conveyed, but at the creator. They stated that although \na product might not deal with queer themes, or feature “queer aesthetics,” if it was created by a \nqueer person, a piece of media can “usually be defined as queer” (44). Using this idea that the \ncreator defines the work, several television shows and film can be seen to fall into this category. \nAlthough they don’t have explicitly asexual characters, or even implicitly asexual characters, or \ninclude any themes which have been picked up by the asexual community as a whole, their \ncreator has stated that the work does indeed feature an asexual character. This category includes \nMarks 20 \n \nthe work Harry Potter, where author J.K. Rowling stated the character Charlie Weasley was \nasexual, despite the fact nothing in the actual work itself deals with this topic. \n \nSirens \nSimply put, a canon is what is officially accepted as part of a work, be it literature, film \nor television. Although the Olivia Experiment and Bojack Horseman both deal with themes of \nasexuality, only Sirens explicitly names the main character as asexual as a canonical part of the \nstory. Many different indicators say that Bojack Horseman will eventually name Todd as \nasexual, and the Oliva Experiment’s plot centered on the question of the protagonist’s asexuality, \nbut nevertheless, Sirens is the only one that actually made it clear. \nSirens is a USA Network comedy show roughly based on the British television series of \nthe same name. The show ran for two seasons on USA Network from March 2014, to April \n2015, and is comprised of 23 total episodes, with a 22 minute run time each. The series was \ncreated Bob Fisher and Denis Leary, and follows the stories of three emergency medical \ntechnician paramedics in Chicago, and the humorous scenarios they often find themselves in. I \nwill specifically be focusing my analysis on episodes 3, 5, 6, 11, 14, 16, and 19, which deal most \nheavily with the reoccurring character Valentina “Voodoo” Dunacci, a member of the EMT \nsquad who is asexual. The character Voodoo, or Voo, played by Kelly O’Sullivan, is a \nparamedic for the fictional Eminent Ambulance Company based in Chicago. Voo’s asexuality is \nfirst brought up in episode six when one of the main characters, Brian, talks to the EMT crew \nabout the possibility of dating her The other EMT’s immediately dismiss this possibility and \neventually reveals that she’s asexual (The Finger). \nMarks 21 \n \nThere are several ways in which Sirens stands out in its depiction of asexuality, but in \nsome areas, I think, it needs more work. The first thing Sirens gets right about asexuality is \nsimply naming it. Although the act of naming asexuality might seem inconsequential, the vast \nmajority of many movies, TV shows and books feature characters which, on closer analysis, \ncould be interpreted as asexual, but nevertheless fail to state it in the text, leaving lots of \nambiguity. Sirens however, removes the requirement of audience interpretation completely by \nexplicitly naming asexuality in the show. \nThis explicit naming impacted viewers in an overall positive way, and Twitter and \nTumblr users took to the web to air their reactions. Some were very enthusiastic, “SIRENS HAS \nAN ASEXUAL MAIN CHARACTER AND THEY DIDNT MAKE HER A PUNCH LINE. IM \nSO HAPPY RIGHT NOW I COULD CRY (phoenixfrost).” Others however were still excited \nbut more muted, “@SirensUSA So glad I started watching, can't believe this show is real. Ty & \n@_kellyosullivan for respectfully portraying an asexual on TV! (@dana_LaBerge),” while \nothers just expressed simple thanks. “@SirensUSA Hey, thanks for Voodoo. Never thought I'd \nsee an explicitly asexual character on TV <3 (@paigeisnotreal).” \nIt’s important to note that the inclusion of an asexual character in Sirens was not a \nfaithful adaption of the British material, but an intentional deviation, as the original show had no \nsuch character like Voo. Bob Fisher, the creator of the U.S. version of Sirens, told Slate that \nwhen they were adapting the show they thought about friends who identified as asexual, and \nsaid, “We did some research, and we thought that it would be an interesting thing to explore.” \nFisher stated that they saw an asexual character as a unique twist on the conventional will-they-\nwon’t-they relationship plotline. “It’s an entirely new spin on that issue, because you have a \ncharacter who won’t. If they feel a strong friendship, how do they navigate that?”  \nMarks 22 \n \nThis leads to another interesting aspect of the show, that of the relationship between \nBrian, a heterosexual man, and Voo, an asexual woman, as well as her later relationship with \nanother asexual man (Screw the One Percent). A show with an asexual person is rare enough, but \nto have that person shown in two different, relationships, one with a straight man, is completely \nunheard of. While the majority of Sirens deals with canon asexuality, it does dip into implication \nby not explicitly addressing Voo’s potential aromanticism. Although the show never defines \naromanticism or separates it from asexuality, based on Voo’s interest in dating, as well as her \ncomments about liking “men who act and look like men, (The Finger),” I believe it’s safe to \nassume she is probably not aromantic. \nHowever, as I stated above, I do believe this is one area where Sirens missed the mark a \nlittle because, although Voo has a relationship with Brian, their relationship ultimately fails. Voo \nis convinced Brian cannot have a relationship without sex, and although he denies it at first, \nBrian is also shown to struggle, miserable without sex (Transcendual). In reality, many couples \nsuccessfully navigate the difficulties of having an asexual and non-asexual relationship, and I \nthink having Brian and Voo break up so soon was a missed opportunity to really show an asexual \nperson in a healthy, long term relationship. Although Voo herself is shown as quite outgoing and \nsociable, in generally asexual people are often viewed as misfits with few social skills (Scherrer), \nand depicting an asexual character in a longterm relationship could have fought that stereotype. \nIt strikes me that perhaps the show tried so hard to emphasize how necessary sex was to Brian’s \nrelationship in order to emphasize how unnecessary it was for Voo, without considering the more \nnuanced benefits a depiction a relationship between an asexual and a non-asexual person could \nbring.  \nMarks 23 \n \nI also have an issue with the implications Voo’s character creates when combined with \nher asexuality. On the show, Voo is depicted as having an intense scientific curiosity, almost \ngiddiness about extremely dark, morbid and disgusting things. Her nickname, Voodoo, comes \nfrom her interest in the occult. In one episode, Brian gives her a severed human finger as a way \nof asking her out, which she accepts with delight (The Finger). The other EMT’s often remark on \nthis, and call her different, “not like other humans,” and, “Darth Vader with tits dark (The \nFinger).” They joke that if Brian were going to date her, he’d probably end up dismembered or \ntied up in a dungeon (The Finger). By itself, this aspect of Voo could be seen as a refreshing, \nfeminist take on womanhood; however, when combined with her asexuality, a troubling \nimplication arises, that it's her asexuality that causes her to be less than human.  \nAs was said earlier, often the only character in a work that isn’t interested in sex in is also \nthe character that is the greatest removed from humanity, and displays the least human like traits. \nA good example is be the android Data from Star Trek, another human adjacent character that \nhas attempted romance and sex on a few occasions to please other humans, but has no sexual or \nromantic desire of his own (In Theory). Another example would be the many incarnations of the \nDoctor from Doctor Who. A human-like alien, he has steadfastly refused to become romantic or \nsexual with his female or male companions over the years, puzzles over human relationships, \nsexuality and romance, and generally dislikes any assumption that he’s sexually attracted to \nhumans. In fact in an interview, Matt Smith, who at that time was playing the 11th Doctor, \nactually said that he played the character as asexual. “The Doc’s idea of an orgy is playing chess \nwith an ostrich. His brain doesn’t work in that way. He would find it weird and peculiar. He \nfinds women peculiar. He is quite asexual (S6 E5).” \nMarks 24 \n \nOr look at Sherlock Holmes, the detective iconic for his observational skills, but also his \ninability to express human emotions. In a letter written by Sir Arthor Conan Doyle in 1892 to his \nmentor Joseph Bell, Doyle discusses Holmes sexuality where he compares him to a machine. \n\"Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage's Calculating Machine, and just about as likely to fall in \nlove (Conan 1892),” he writes. Or consider this paragraph in the story, where Dr. Watson writes \nabout Holmes admiration of Irene Adler. “All emotions, and [love] particularly, were abhorrent \nto his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning \nand observing machine that the world has seen… (Doyle 239).” In these short examples, we \ntwice see Doyle compare Holmes to a machine, cold, calculating, and above all unable to love or \nfeel love, and unfortunately fairly representative of the depictions of asexuality in more modern \nmedia. So while it’s nice that Sirens took time to fully develop a nontraditional portrayal of \nfemininity on television, unfortunately this characterization of Voo as “not like other humans” \nalongside her asexuality, reinforces some troubling ideas. \nIn this same scene, the characters make several more remarks about Voo’s asexuality, \ncalling it a “pathology,” “strange,” and “boring” (The Finger). So while the EMT’s seem to fully \ngrasp and respect the fact Voo will never want sex, and never indicate a desire to “fix” her, they \nalso mock her sexuality for being strange and boring, and medicalize it by calling it a pathology, \nwhich plays into the long history of non-heterosexual identities being classified as pathologies, \ndiseases or deviancy. Recent research on the topic of asexual individuals coming out found that \nthe majority of them faced pathologization by partners, friends, family or acquaintances when \ncoming out, and many more reported isolation, unwanted sex and relationship conflict (“What \nDoes Asexuality Teach Us” 7-8; Robbins et al.). \nMarks 25 \n \nAlthough authors cannot dictate how an audience receives their message, they can help \nadd certain perspectives that didn’t exist before, and while I believe that authorial additions are \nthe weakest part of any work, as and all works can and should stand alone, understanding how \nthe author interprets their own work can lend valuable understanding. True to this, the word of \nGod from Sirens creators lends new context to this scene. In the interview for Slate, Fisher stated \nthat they introduced the about asexuality for the express purpose of dispelling them for the \naudience. “In the first episode that we dealt with Voodoo’s asexuality, we allowed the guys to \nmake some jokes about it, but that was actually to knock down a series of tropes that you will \nhear people say about asexuals, (Slate).” He goes on to say that they were also careful to respect \nVoo’s asexuality and not get “cheap laughs” from it. So while Voo’s personality still has \ntroubling implications when tied with her asexuality, with the context the interview grants, I \nbelieve this particular scene and the one before it can be seen in a new light, as a scene explicitly \ndesigned by the writers to educate the audience on asexuality. And indeed, minutes later in the \nnext scene, Brian discusses the intensive research he did on asexuality the night before (The \nFinger), and talks about the legitimacy of it as a sexuality, as well as the asexual movement and \ntheir symbol. However, the notion of her asexuality continues to be mocked by the other EMT’s, \nboth gay and straight, despite Brian’s best efforts to inform them on the topic. \nIn addition, given the writers’ comments, I believe a much bigger significance comes \nfrom the fact the pathology statement came from a gay EMT. As asexuality has gained more \nrecognition as a movement and sexuality, it has begun to encounter resistance on whether or not \n(cisgender) asexual aromantics truly belong in the LGBT community. This argument has mostly \nplayed out in online communities, most notably Tumblr, and other microblogging platforms. The \nargument goes that the LGBT community was founded exclusively to provide safe spaces for \nMarks 26 \n \npeople who have experienced homophobia or transphobia, which means trans people and people \nwho experience same gender attraction. And since cis asexual aromantics experience no \nattraction, and are not trans, they should not have access to LGBT resources (Radioactive; \nTiredofcishets; Aphobiakills). On the other side however is the argument that says, as a \nmarginalized sexuality which does not align with heteronormative practices, asexuals deserve \nrecognition and acceptance in LGBT spaces. This argument also often includes a comparison to \nthe struggle the trans community faced decades ago to be included in the lesbian and gay \ncommunity, and how they were also met with the argument that their modes of oppression and \nmovement goals were too different from the lesbian and gay community’s (Asexuality Archive; \nGriff). Raymond argues that queer is a “category in flux (98),” and says that while there is no \nconsensus on the term, it should be fluid, politically radical, and reject binary categories such as \nheterosexual/homosexual. She says queer tends to be more “universalizing” rather than \n“minoritizing” (98) and that it works to problematize certain questions that have otherwise been \nstandard in gay and lesbian theory. I find this definition (or lack thereof) to be useful in my own \nwork with asexuality, as asexuality often finds itself on the fringes of both queer and straight, \nand has trouble finding a place in both. \nThe question of whether asexuals are inherently LGBT, and whether they can claim and \nuse LGBT terms like queer, can and should be its own separate paper, but addressing that issue is \nnot my goal here. The extremely brief and simple arguments I laid out above do not do either \nside justice and are only intended to give the smallest of contexts in order for you to better \nunderstand the deeper conflicts running beneath this scene. Fisher said in the Slate interview that \nhe believes it’s human nature for people to joke about something they don’t really understand, or \nthat makes them uncomfortable. The fact that Fisher deliberately chose a gay EMT to make the \nMarks 27 \n \npathologizing remarks on asexuality speaks to how seriously Fisher might view these divides, if \nhe was aware of them, which I believe he was given the amount of research he claimed to do.  \nOverall, Sirens provides one of the first canon depictions of asexuality on mainstream \ntelevision. Its long term focus on the character’s asexuality allows for an in depth analysis of its \nframing and positioning, and its depiction of a relationship between an asexual and non-asexual \ncharacter is unique on television. \n \nThe Olivia Experiment \nAlthough it had little cultural impact, I chose to analyze The Olivia Experiment because \nit’s perhaps the first full length, non-documentary film about asexuality. This provides a unique \nopportunity because most works that currently feature asexual characters are television shows. \nThe Olivia Experiment, an independent comedy film which premiered on November \n2012, was produced by Mansfield Films and directed by Sonja Schneck. The plot focuses on \nOlivia, a 27-year-old grad student who is a virgin and suspects she might be asexual but isn’t \nsure. As a grad student in Gender Studies, she decides to make an experiment out of it, and goes \nabout documenting and filming her journey into sex. \nOverall, I found The Olivia Experiment had a strangely mixed view of sexuality, pairing \ninnovative and progressive depictions of asexuality right alongside harmful stereotypes of not \nonly asexuality, but bisexuality as well, which I will mention but not explore in depth. The film \nopens with Olivia attending an asexual support group. The audience hears voices of asexual \nindividuals discussing their struggles with being intimate with their partner, trying and failing to \nachieve arousal through masturbation, or the first time they realized they were asexual. The \nMarks 28 \n \nsupport group welcomes Olivia as a new member and encourages her to tell her story. She is \nhesitant at first, saying that she’s not even sure if she’s asexual. The group leader reassures her \nand tells her many of them tried on different identities at first, but that it “wasn’t until we found \nother aces that we could really find a label that fit.” The other group members chime in with the \nlabels they tried on and proceed to list gay, bi, straight, and cross dresser. Emboldened, Olivia \nbegins by mentioning that she has struggled with intimacy issues and then goes into a light rant \nabout how society constantly pushes sex at people. She then discusses her difficulties of living in \nsuch a world saying, “I can’t function normally in society, and I need to work on that.” \nThis scene functions as an intimate and unique look into the daily lives and struggles of \nasexual people, primarily painting them as fairly average individuals, concerned with things that \nmany other people deal with such as relationship intimacy or issues of identity. Their asexuality \nis portrayed as natural and like any other sexuality, rather than as a punchline, illness, or \ndeformity. Unfortunately, we never see this support group or members again beyond this three \nminute scene, but given that a single asexual person shown on screen is so rare—let alone a \ngroup—I think this scene is particularly valuable as a way to normalize asexuality for \nmainstream audiences who might enter into the film with no context for what asexuality is. \nHowever, after such an interesting opening scene, almost all of that progress is \nundermined by the proceeding interaction. After the meeting is over and as Olivia begins to \nleave, the group leader approaches her and tells her she should consider trying another support \ngroup, saying that sometimes “people use asexuality to hide.” Although it’s not stated, it’s \nimplied that the group leader doesn’t quite believe Olivia is asexual, and perhaps thinks that \nOlivia might just be dealing with some unresolved intimacy issues. I think this is a particularly \npuzzling and troubling approach for the film to take, especially because of how heavily the film \nMarks 29 \n \nemphasized the fluidity of sexual identity, exploration and “finding yourself” in the first 5 \nminutes, only to suggest that Olivia is using asexuality as an excuse or faking it. As Chasin and \nEmens have noted, Western society privileges sexuality as normative, implying that asexuality is \nan illegitimate or even nonexistent sexual identity; and this moment in the film reiterates that \nimplication.  Of course the main plot revolves around the fact that Olivia herself isn’t quite sure \nof her sexuality, so I would expect doubt to be a prominent theme in the film, but this is still a \ntroubling way for the film to emphasize the notion of asexuality as potentially “fake,” and the \ntheme of uncertainty could have been expressed in a much more affirming way, such as having \nOlivia return again and again to the support group to update them on her progress, and have her \nreceive recognition that whatever identity she decides on, even if it isn’t asexuality, is valid. \nInterestingly, however, this isn’t the only time that an asexual support group has been \nshown on screen. Shortland Street is New Zealand’s longest running drama and soap opera and  \none of the most watched television programs in the country. In the show, the character Gerald \nslowly begins to realize he’s asexual. He eventually attends an asexual support group and the \ncontrasts between the two depictions are immediately evident. In Shortland Street, the group is \nmuch more casual and more encouraging of exploration and uncertainty. They help Gerald come \nto terms with his asexuality and let him know it’s okay if he isn’t completely sure. This is a huge \ncontrast with how The Olivia Experiment portrays the group, where the group leader almost \ninsists that Olivia must be certain she’s asexual before being allowed to join. Overall, Shortland \nStreet is a much healthier depiction of a group whose very nature is supposed to be supportive. \nOver the course of the film, the group leader is by far not the only one to question \nOlivia’s asexuality. As she continues her experiment, parents, friends and colleagues continually \ndoubt her sexuality and continually suggest that she might simply be shy or not well adjusted, a \nMarks 30 \n \nclassic response to asexuality. After the support group, the first reaction the viewers see to the \npossibility that she might be asexual is one of doubt. It comes from Julian, a gay man who is her \nroommate and close friend. He tells her he doesn’t think she’s asexual and that she “might want \nto try sex as an option.” This rhetoric does accurately portray the real life oppression which \nasexuals can face in the LGBT community, but unlike Sirens, the film does not try to refute this \nharmful idea that asexuals simply need to “try sex” as the whole film is about this very concept. \nAnd unlike Sirens, there has been no Word of God that could establish this scene as an \nintentional commentary on how asexuality is viewed in the LGBT community. There is a \ndelicate balance that needs to be toed between encouraging someone’s self-exploration into their \nown sexuality and insisting that the only way for someone’s identity to be valid is if they actually \nengage in sex is crossing it. Unfortunately, given the lack of authorial context and the ambiguity \nin the film, I believe this film falls on the latter side more than the former. However, to the film’s \ncredit, it does seem to finally refute this idea in the extreme end of the film, but even this is \nvague and requires immense interpretation.  \nOne of the biggest redeeming points for the film is the way in which it frames the \nexperiment. Olivia is filming the experiment for her studies, and a camerawoman follows her \naround filming everything. At many points in the film Olivia turns directly to the camera and \naddresses the audience, explaining why she’s making certain choices. The framing here is quite \nclever, as the movie literally turns the camera around and makes Olivia the viewer, not the \nobject. This grants her a much higher level of agency in the movie, and indeed, overall, Olivia \nherself provides the great majority of the drive to complete the experiment and have sex, rather \nthan any outside influences. After she decides to create the experiment, Olivia speaks directly to \nher camera saying, “I’m scholar who believes in the close readings to text as a means of \nMarks 31 \n \napproaching understanding, yet I have repeatedly failed at my own self-analysis, and hope that \nthis effort will enable me to interpret my own situation.” Olivia clearly feels she doesn’t know \nenough about herself to declare for certain what her sexuality is and this experiment will get her \ncloser to the answers she seeks. There are several times where other characters do indeed suggest \nshe shouldn’t go through with the experiment if she’s truly not comfortable with the idea of \nhaving sex, but she remains determined to try. By emphasizing Olivia’s control over the \nexperiment, I believe the film does help to create a narrative of self-exploration rather than \noutside influences pressuring her into engaging in sex. \nBut while the film seems to recognize and uphold the idea that asexuality in general is \nreal and valid, it continually re-emphasizes that Olivia’s asexuality might not be. The film leaves \nit intentionally vague whether or not Olivia is actually asexual, or if she has simply been too \nawkward and unsociable to ever get a relationship up to this point, a common portrayal of \nasexuality in the media. In the ending however, she addresses her camera for the last time and \nstates that “every legitimate experiment has a conclusion, and so it follows logically, this \nexperiment might not be entirely legitimate.” As her new, male partner steps into the camera, she \nlooks at him and then addresses the camera with, “However, a gray zone isn’t always a terrible \nplace in which to be,” and the credits roll. While the viewer is left to draw their own conclusions \nof whether or not Olivia is actually asexual, this ending seems to signal that ultimately it’s not \nimportant, and that Olivia is giving up on her official experiment in favor of a more “natural” \nexploration of her sexuality with the understanding that she might not truly ever know herself. \nWhile the idea that sexuality is fluid and not always easily defined or important is a very feminist \nconcept, in this context it still leaves me frustrated. I see a similarity between this attitude and \nthose who claim we live in a post-racial society, that skin color shouldn’t matter and that they \nMarks 32 \n \n“don’t see color.” While gender, sexuality or skin color should ultimately not factor into how \nsociety judges a person, this is not the reality for many queer people. For many asexual people \nwho face discrimination from both their LGBT peers and mainstream heteronormative society, \ntheir sexuality is a vital part of their identity, it shapes who they are and how they perceive, and \nare perceived by, the world. With so few depictions of asexuality in the media already, creating a \nwhole movie about asexuality and then ending it on a note of indifference towards the topic \nseems counterproductive. \nIn the end, I believe by choosing to highlight the “will-she-won’t-she” of Olivia’s \njourney, and ending the film on a purposefully ambiguous note, the film undermines any \nmessage it was attempting to convey about the validity and importance of her asexuality, as well \nas others. With the film ending how it does, I struggled on whether to categorize Olivia’s \nasexuality into cannon or implied. Fittingly, this seemed to parallel the struggle Olivia herself \nfaced for the majority of the film in trying to identify herself. However, once I realized exactly \nhow unsure I was if Olivia ended up identifying as asexual, I knew the film and Olivia herself \nneeded to be sorted as implied. Although the theme of the movie was very exactly asexual, as for \ncanon asexual representation, it’s not. As a viewer, the conclusion I felt forced into by the film \nwas that it ultimately doesn’t matter what your sexuality is. And while this message may be \ncomforting to some, for the majority of asexual people looking for simple representations of \nthemselves on film and television, I believe this ending did more harm than good. \n \n \n \nMarks 33 \n \nBojack Horseman \nOne of the biggest moments in the asexual community came in the summer of 2016 when \nthe final episode of the third season of the popular Netflix original show Bojack Horseman \npremiered. A quick search of Twitter during that time turns up a gamut of emotions, the majority \nof which ranged from disbelief, “Can you believe Bojack Horseman has a canon ace character \nbecause I'm still processing” (@leiaskywalkers), to admiration, “bojack horseman is the first \nshow i’ve seen with an explicitly asexual character. heart. eyes” (@takeallofspace), to something \na little stronger. \"OH MY GOD DID BOJACK HORSEMAN JUST CANONLY CONFIRM \nTODD AS QUEER AND/OR POSSIBLY ASEXUAL I AM SCREAMING RIGHT NOW THIS \nIS A GR8 SHOW” (@adelaideclare9). \nWhile a comedic, animated television show featuring an alcoholic, anthropomorphic \nhorse seems like an unusual venue for breaking new ground in the media representation of \nsexuality, nevertheless that is exactly what Bojack Horseman has seemed to accomplish. \nBojack Horseman was not the first show to feature an asexual character on television, but \nit was perhaps the most popular show to American viewers, and had one of the most widely \ncelebrated. For the asexual community, this moment was huge. For the first time asexual people \nwere able to see themselves and their journey reflected accurately: not as a joke or an illness, but \nas a legitimate sexuality in a fully developed, main character. \nAs a story about asexuality, Bojack Horseman is all about the implication of asexuality, \nand not the direct confirmation, and while it left me applauding it, it also left me wishing it had \ngone even further. There are currently 37 episodes in the show, each with a runtime of 25 \nminutes, and the show has ended its third season, with a fourth set to premiere mid 2017. Often \nMarks 34 \n \ncalled equal parts dark and funny, the show was created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg and stars \nWill Arnett as Bojack, and Aaron Paul as Todd Chavez, an on and off entrepreneurial genius and \nBojack’s freeloading roommate. Bojack Horseman has received high praise from critics for \nproviding some of the most poignant satire of Hollywood, celebrity culture and the film industry \non television today. It currently holds 100 percent approval ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and a 90 \npercent on Metacritic indicating “universal acclaim.” \nHowever, despite its witty commentary, the show didn’t truly earn the distinction of \nbeing groundbreaking until the final episode of its third season. In the episode entitled, “That \nWent Well,” Todd has a discussion with a former girlfriend about his sexuality. In it, Todd \ncomes out as asexual, and in doing so, becomes one of the first leading asexual characters on \ntelevision. I will be discussing the whole show, however the majority of my analysis will be on \nseason three, as that is where the show begins to explore Todd’s asexuality. \nNico W., an asexual individual and writer for the popular women-focused pop culture \nwebsite The Mary Sue, wrote on how closely the emotions depicted in Bojack Horseman \nmirrored their own real life self-relization and coming out process. “I was bewildered by just \nhow realistic the portrayal was. The very words that Todd used to describe his sexuality (or lack \nthereof) had escaped my own lips, practically verbatim, on more than one occasion…To not only \nhave my obscure orientation depicted on a mainstream show, but also to have it be an entirely \naccurate representation of my experience, was nothing short of mind-boggling” (W., 2016). \nWhile searching for commentary on Todd’s asexuality, I found a similar idea resurfacing \nagain and again. Asexual viewers were struck by how close to home Todd’s journey was to their \nown. From childhood to young adulthood, unsure of what makes him different and afraid to ask, \nmany viewers, like Nico, saw themselves represented for the first time on television. It’s \nMarks 35 \n \nimportant however here to note that so far, every asexual character which I have discussed has \nbeen white. Despite asexuality in general becoming a more popular topic to explore in television \nand film, asexual people of color have still not seen themselves represented on screen, and have \nundergone their own symbolic annihilation. And although a discussion on the sexualities of \npeople of color is its own thesis, I think it’s important to touch upon this issue and how it relates \nto asexuality. A large part of the way brown and black people are dehumanized and oppressed in \nthe Western world is by emasculation and de-sexualization—the sexually unappealing mammy, \nthe stereotype of effeminate Asian men, etc.—or hypersexualization (Compulsory Sexuality \n141). In many ways people of color don’t get the luxury of being asexual, as they are already \nstruggling to reclaim their sexuality for themselves and have it depicted on screen. \nThe reveal to Todd’s asexuality throughout season 3 is long, subtle and slow. Many \nviewers didn’t pick up on the clues being laid down until immediately before the final scene, and \nthe words asexual are never actually said throughout the show, even in the final episode, which I \nwill discuss later. Because of the intentional framing of his asexuality as a surprise, the majority \nof the asexual representation in this show is therefore connotative and implied, and requires the \nviewer to go back to rewatch scenes with the asexual framework in mind to fully grasp the \nmeaning the writers intended. \nThe first episode that touches on Todd’s sexuality is in Season Three, episode two. In this \nepisode, the show flashes back to the year 2007, when Todd was still in high school. We see him \ntalking with his friend Emily. She asks him who he likes and he responds truthfully by saying he \ndoesn’t like anyone. Emily is incredulous and says he has to like someone. He stammers and \neventually, half-heartedly says the name of a popular female classmate. Emily is disappointed \nand almost says “I love you” but catches herself. Later, they are shown in a closet at a party for \nMarks 36 \n \nthe classic “game” Seven Minutes in Heaven. Todd is obviously uncomfortable and asks how \nsoon he can leave. Emily takes this to mean that he’d rather be with the other girl he mentioned, \nbut he confesses he’s nervous because he’s never actually kissed anyone. Emily eagerly takes the \nlead and they kiss. \nFlash forward, and we find that Emily and Todd have been dating for two months. Sitting \non her parent’s bed after making out, Emily asks Todd if he’d like to have sex. Todd reacts with \nthe same visible hesitation he did to that first kiss in the closet, and Emily immediately \nbacktracks, saying she doesn’t want to pressure him. Despite his discomfort, Todd insists he \nwants to and slowly begins to take off her clothing while awkwardly babbling. However, before \nthey can continue they are interrupted by the untimely arrival of Emily’s parents. Sometime at an \nunspecified point they break up for an unspecified reason. At this point Todd’s discomfort with \nsex and sexual attraction has been clearly established, but without the final revelation in the \nseason finale, Todd’s reactions in this episode could easily be chalked up to the awkward \nfumbling of an inexperienced and shy teen, which I suspect is exactly what the writers were \ngoing for. However, with the asexual framework in mind, the complexities of what was depicted \ncan begin to be uncovered. What is shown here is not simply an awkward, inexperienced teen \ndealing with sex for the first time, but a young, asexual boy struggling to navigate a world that \nviews sex and sexual desire as inherent and natural. \nEmily’s insistence that Todd must like someone displays the pressure young asexual \nindividuals often face growing up. For Emily, sex and attraction are a part of being human, and \nso someone not liking another person is almost unthinkable. Again, when they’re in the closet, \nthe assumption from Emily and the viewer is that Todd is a young man who has sexual desires, \nand is hesitant not because he doesn’t want to kiss her, but because he doesn’t know how to. \nMarks 37 \n \nStudios in general tend to shy away from depicting teens or children from developing or \nexpecting any sort of queer relationship, instead preferring to stick to older adults. Therefore this \nintimate look into the development of Todd’s identity as a young adult is one that is particularly \nvaluable, not only to an asexual audience, but to anyone who didn’t experience traditional \nheteronormative attraction growing up. \nIn episode five of the season, Todd and Emily run into each other in the present day at a \nrehearsal dinner for a wedding. As they catch up Emily casually asks how Todd’s girlfriend is \nand Todd laughs. He tells her he doesn’t have a girlfriend, and says she must be so embarrassed \nfor making such a “weird assumption,” seemingly oblivious to her attempts to flirt with him. \nFurther, his comments clearly indicate that he doesn’t view having a girlfriend to be a natural \nassumption to make about him. Seeing the two talking, Bojack slips Todd a room key for a hotel \nroom, telling them to go “try out the bed,” and Emily is enthusiastic. Todd is now very \nuncomfortable but agrees nonetheless, saying he first has to have a drink or two and leaves. \nLater, right as Emily and Todd are about to enter the room, Todd is still agitated and quickly \nturns to a rather absurd excuse to distract her, asking if she wants to “jump in the laundry cart \nand pretend we’re ghosts.” Emily is annoyed with this and tells him she just wants to go have \nsex, and asks if he still wants to. He says yes but says it’s not a good idea because she’s drunk. \nShe says she’s not drunk at all, and Todd immediately says that actually he’s drunk and not \nfeeling well, and enters his room alone, leaving Emily standing in the hallway confused. Later he \nis shown laying, curled up on the bed looking sad. \nIn one of the following episodes, Emily ends up sleeping with Bojack, and both of them \nagree to keep it a secret. When tensions get to high however, Emily sits down with Todd and \nexplains that she can’t stay and work on their business venture together with him anymore and \nMarks 38 \n \nthat’s she’s leaving, in part because of Bojack. Despite her obvious allusions to the fact they had \nsex, Todd doesn’t seem to pick up on this and is later shocked to find out they slept together, \nfurther indicating his lack of ability to pick up on social cues involving sex.  \nIn the finale, Todd and Emily are sitting in a diner booth when she finally bluntly asks \nhim if he’s gay and tells him it’s okay if he is. Todd is shocked and stammers out an answer. \n“I’m not gay,” he says. “I mean, I don’t think I am. But I don’t think I’m straight, either. I don’t \nknow what I am. I think I might be nothing.” Immediately Emily smiles and tells him it’s okay, \nand they both relax, and soon after the scene cuts. This is all the further development Todd gets \non the show as the final credits roll a little later. \nThis scene struck me as unique for several reasons, the biggest of which is Emily’s \nimmediate acceptance of Todd’s answer. Very rarely are characters met with that level of \nacceptance when coming out, and it was very refreshing to see this. In addition, although it was \nan end of season reveal, it was not played for shock value; there was no drama in the scene and \nno jokes made about Todd’s sexuality. It was framed rather as a simple and heartfelt moment \nbetween two friends. \nHowever, my main issue with the scene is that it never actually uses the word asexual. \nOne of the biggest issues facing asexual representation in media is the lack of explicitly named \nasexuals. Having Todd or Bojack or Emily use the word would have been an enormous \naccomplishment for mainstream television and a big step for asexual activists. However, I still \nwant to give the show a lot of credit here because while I do sincerely wish they’d used the word, \nbecause of the point Todd is at in his journey, it feels natural and fitting to have him express \nhimself in this way. In Season One Todd was a millennial couch potato without a care or \nambition in the world. However, over three seasons, he’s grown into a 25-year-old who is just \nMarks 39 \n \nbeginning to come into himself as a person and is just on the very fringes of what figuring out his \nlife’s goals and dreams. When it comes to his sexuality, therefore, it’s not much of a shock for \nthe audience when they realize that maybe he hasn’t quite gotten that figured out either. Having \nTodd unable to completely and accurately articulate exactly what he’s feeling, and instead \nshowing him tiptoeing through social interactions, trying to figure out what makes him different, \ncomes off as an authentic portrayal of self-exploration rather than a crude stereotype. For many \nyoung asexual people, Todd’s journey as shown here mimics much of their own experiences \ngrowing up without an exact name to put to what they felt inside. \nPerhaps one of the most important things Bojack Horseman did for asexuality was \nhumanize it, an ironic thing coming from a show where half the cast is animals. The few rare \ntimes asexuality is represented on film, asexuals are usually represented as robots, aliens or given \ntraits like psychopathy ore reclusiveness. Todd however is very human. Lovable, weird, flawed, \nand wonderful, he’s perhaps one of the most human characters on the show. \nBecause this was the last episode of the final season so far, it’s anyone’s guess where the \nshow will take Todd’s story now. And while one can hope the writers handle it with care and \ndignity, helping him to grow as a character, all we really have to go off of is the Word of God \nfrom interviews with the creators and actors. In an interview with Decider, the creator of the \nshow, Bob-Waksberg, seemed to indicate that he does eventually plan on labeling Todd, but held \noff on it for character development reasons, saying, “I guess I’m avoiding putting a label on him \nat this point because he’s yet to put a label on himself.” Aaron Paul, Todd’s voice actor also said \nin an interview with the New York Times that he believes Todd may be “the first asexual \ncharacter on television.” While this is not true, it heavily suggests that the label they will end up \nusing will in fact be asexual. However, regardless of whatever direction Bojack Horseman \nMarks 40 \n \neventually goes however, I don’t believe it will diminish what the show has accomplished so far. \nBy grounding a story of lack of asexuality—or at least of lack of sexual desire—in a respectful \nand successful way, the show has given asexual viewers a small bit of the much needed \nrepresentation they so deserve. \n \nWhere Does that Leave Us? \nTaken together, these shows paint a complex picture of how asexuality is depicted in \npopular culture today. However, these three pieces of media are, unfortunately, an exception to \nthe norm. These works, plus the New Zealand show Shortland Street, are arguably the only \nworks in popular culture today which deal with themes of asexuality in any meaningful, explicit \nway. As asexuality has risen to public consciousness, more and more television shows and films \nhave chosen to canonically name characters as asexual. However, those characters are most often \neither side characters, appearing once and then disappearing forever, or if they are a main \ncharacter, their asexuality is brought up once and then never addressed again, making any sort of \nin depth critical analysis almost impossible. Very rarely are asexual characters given their own \nstory lines or allowed any agency in the show. At best the depictions focus on the asexual \ncharacter and deal with in-depth and nuanced topics like we have seen in Sirens, Shortland \nStreet, and even the Olivia Experiment (despite her reluctance to identify as asexual in the end). \nThese shows allow asexual characters to address complex issues like relationships, desire, and \nliving in a world that seems to be constantly sexualized.  \nLower down the ladder are the canonical, less powerful and effective depictions: shows \nwhich name characters as asexual in a respectful yet very superficial way, such as Poppy from \nMarks 41 \n \nHuge (Movie Night), or the random, unnamed extra in Faking It (Untitled), or Jughead from \nArchie Comics (Zdarsky and Henderson). At worst are the depictions of asexuality which \nactively push harmful stereotypes about it, such as the House episode. \nHowever, as stated earlier, most asexual ‘representation’ is connotative, falling into the \ncategory of implied asexuality. These characters are not explicitly asexual; rather they are \ncovertly coded as such, in ways very reminiscent of Gross’ 1991 analysis of how gay men and \nlesbian women were coded decades ago. Hinted at through these codes, viewers get to witness \ncharacters who just “aren’t interested in sex,” rather than characters who are explicitly asexual. \nThere are no mentions of the word asexuality, just characters who “don’t like sex.” Again, at best \nthey’re engaging and thought provoking like in Bojack Horseman, exploring the complications \nof existing without sexual desire in a sexualnormative world, even if they don’t explicitly use the \nword asexual. This can also be seen in the fairly neutral depiction of asexuality in Doctor Who, a \ncharacter who is intelligent, brave and generally a positive role model, or the Professor from \nGilligan’s Island, whose character, in an unusual move for the time, said onscreen that he had no \ninterest in sex or romance, and who was described by the actor as being asexual (Dunham).  \nAt worst, however, these depictions perpetrate the myths that asexuality is a result of lack \nof empathy or caused by medical issues, such as the eunuch Varys from Game of Thrones who \nsays he has never had an interest in women or men (The Laws of Gods and Men). However, \nthere is a debate regarding if this is positive or negative representation given the fact Varys is an \neunuch, although Varys does imply he didn’t have sexual desire even before he was castrated. \nThere’s also the serial killer Dexter who, in the very first episode of Dexter, makes it clear to the \nviewer that his apparent interest in sex and romance is all part of his “disguise” to appear more \nnormal. “I don't understand sex. It's not in my nature. I don't have anything against women, and I \nMarks 42 \n \ncertainly have an appropriate sensibility about men, but when it comes to the actual act of sex, it \njust seems so undignified” (Pilot). Thus the conclusion the viewer is left with is that sexual \ndesire is natural and good and only someone with physical or mental illness would avoid it. \nThe lowest and least effective or meaningful level is the Word of God, where \nrepresentations of asexuality aren’t made explicitly canonical or even hinted at in the show. The \nonly evidence they exist is because the creators, the auteurs, the producers—the Gods of the \nfictional universe—have stated they are. Bojack Horseman falls into this category because \nalthough the show itself never confirmed Todd as asexual, interviews done with Todd’s actor \nand the show’s writer confirm that he is indeed asexual. However, as argued above, in addition \nto being in the Word of God category, the show also falls into the Implied category because it \ndoes deal with themes of asexuality, even though the character himself isn’t canonical yet. Alan \nfrom the Hangover franchise also falls into this category, confirmed by the director as asexual \n(Vineyard), as well as Misty Day from American Horror Story, confirmed by the creator and \nproducer of the show (Stack). However, these two shows would not fall into the Implied \ncategory as defined here, because they don’t deal with asexual themes at all. \nOftentimes it isn’t the characters who are explicitly described as not having a libido that \nare as interesting as the ones who are naturally assumed not to. No analysis of asexuality in the \nmedia can occur without inspecting the ways in which asexuality intersects with other identities. \nSexualnormativity is a useful tool to identify how the “desexualization of particular groups can \nbe used as a method of social control (Gupta “Compulsory Sexuality”). Sexualnormativity \nassumes most people have sexual desire, but there are certain bodies which do not fall within \nsexualnormative bounds and which society has forcibly removed or refused to grant sexuality in \nthe first place. When the asexual body presented on camera aligns with the sexualnormative \nMarks 43 \n \nassumptions about which bodies “should” be sexual, people actively demand explanations for a \ncharacter’s lack of sexual desire in a way that they do not if the body falls outside of \nsexualnormative norms, such as trans, disabled or elderly bodies. And unfortunately, when these \nbodies are granted sexuality, it’s usually as a joke, as a surprise to the audience.  \nHowever, this is not always the case: we occasionally do see pushback against \nsexualnormativity, like when 60-year-old Golden Girl Blanche catches 80-year-old Sophia \nwatching a dirty movie and declares, “I did that once!... it was his birthday (Isn’t It Romantic?).” \nOr when 79-year-old Jane Fonda and 77-year-old Lily Tomlin, spend the entirety of the third \nseason of Grace and Frankie openly discussing their sex lives and starting a vibrator business for \nolder women, and when questioned about it, yell in exasperation that “Older women masturbate \ntoo… and we have vaginas!” (The Coup) Apart from older people, people with physical \ndisabilities are also frequent targets of asexualization in media—especially since age and \ndisability are often conflated—as well as people of color (Collins 2004; Shimizu 2007, Shimizu \n2012), people with mental disabilities (Milligan and Neufeldt 2001), and fat people (Ashill \n2009). \nHowever, when the people to whom society usually grants sexuality (white, young, able-\nbodied, cis) are shown as being asexual, narratives and characters demand an explanation, a \njustification, because surely there must be some reason why this otherwise healthy person would \neschew sex. For House, it was his patient’s illness, for Olivia it her extreme social awkwardness, \nfor Voo, it was her “weirdness,” for the Doctor it was his literal inhumanity. For viewers, these \ncharacters must be justified in order to be accepted as without sexual desire because it’s \ninconceivable that “normal” people exist without sexual desire. This begs the question, would \nHouse have embarked on such a quest if his asexual patients had been 60 years old? Perhaps if \nMarks 44 \n \nthey’d been obese, or in a wheelchair, would he have just assumed that a sexless life was \nappropriate for that identity? In this way, asexuality helps to push the bounds of \nsexualnormativity, deconstructing the notion that sexual desire is natural and inherent to certain \nhumans.  \nThroughout this analysis, we have seen many different interpretations of asexuality. From \nHouse’s view of asexuality as a medical condition, to Siren’s view of asexuality as innate and \nunchanging, to Olivia’s emphasis on the malleability of sexuality, to Bojack Horseman’s \nthoughtful look into the struggles of navigating a sexual world as an asexual teen. Each one of \nthese depictions has provided different positives and negatives for asexual representation, but the \nbiggest difference I would like to emphasize between the shows is the way they go about the \nprocess of naming. Because asexuality is often seen as a “lack” of sexuality, theoretically every \ncharacter that expresses no desire or romantic interest can be asexual or aromantic without \nchanging anything about the story (especially in the realm of children’s media where characters \noften have no specified sexuality, like Stephen Universe). The only difference then, between an \nasexual character and a character that just doesn’t pursue sex, is that one of them is named. \nBecause naming is so vital to asexual representation, it’s vitally important to differentiate \nbetween the works which canonically name their characters as asexual and those that leave it \nimplied. There might be only a one word difference between Canonical and Implied, but saying \nthat one word—asexual—offers a progressive intervention into legitimating this identity \nposition. \nAs noted earlier, Sirens is the only one of the three works that explicitly—and \nrepeatedly—names the character as asexual, and while the Olivia Experiment does deal with \nthemes of asexuality and feature tertiary asexual characters, the title character ultimately does not \nMarks 45 \n \nidentify (or at least reveal to the viewer) as asexual. The Olivia Experiment, much like Sirens, \npresents the viewer with a body that falls within sexualnormative bounds (white, presumptively \ncis, attractive, young, able-bodied, etc.). However, where Sirens attempts to justify Voo’s \nasexuality by emphasizing her dark tendencies, eccentricities, and disconnect from humanity, the \nOlivia Experiment justifies Olivia’s asexuality by emphasizing her lack of social skills, \nsuggesting that perhaps Olivia isn’t asexual, but instead just extremely social inept. And while \nBojack Horseman does neglect to name Todd as asexual, it isn’t out of ignorance of what \nasexuality is, but a conscious choice on the creator’s part to replicate the realistic journey of self-\nrealization and actualization which so many asexual people experience. Bojack Horseman does \nnot attempt to justify Todd’s asexuality by medicalizing it or hinting that it’s because of a lack of \nsocial skills or a disconnect with humanity. \nOne interesting aspect to note is that all three of the main works that I analyzed are \ncomedies, something which I don’t believe is a coincidence. Raymond states that LGBT people \nmore often appear in comedies than dramas because of two reasons. The first is that as traditional \nfamily comedies began to disappear, space opened up for alternative narratives, including those \nof nontraditional “families” such as Friends (101). This allowed room for characters to take on \npositions outside of their traditional gender roles, and slowly television and film began to shift. \nReason two is that situation comedies do not claim to show the audience “real life” and this lack \nof reality may allow them to play with themes under the cover of humor when those themes \nmight be too controversial or sensitive to another audience. This echoes Gross’s argument that \nstudios coded lesbian and gay characters through dress or speech patterns in ways which allowed \nheteronormative studios to use queerness for pleasure and profit in mass culture without \nadmitting to it. \nMarks 46 \n \nAlthough all three shows are comedies, the type of comedy they portray is vastly \ndifferent. Sirens fits the stereotypical situational comedy genre much more tightly than either \nBojack Horseman or the Olivia Experiment, and also emphasizes the familial bond between the \nmembers of the EMT crew, which, as Raymond said, could allow for more characters to \ntransgress their traditional gender roles. This however, can also be limiting in that light hearted \nsituational comedy often provides fewer opportunities for character growth and development, so \nin Sirens we see Voo, firmly established in her identity in a way that is not true of the other \nshows. She does not question her identity or seem to struggle with navigating a sexualized world, \nshe is comfortable with sexual topics, and even her relationship with Brian causes her minimal \nanxiety. This is not true of Bojack Horseman and the Olivia Experiment, both which focus much \nmore heavily on the journey of their asexual character, emphasizing their relationship with the \nsexualized world they live in as they try to find their place in it. The Olivia Experiment \nrepeatedly emphasizes Olivia’s inability to understand certain social cues, and in fact much of \nthe comedy of the show derives from this as well as her discomfort with sex, relationships or her \nown body. Of the three shows, Bojack Horseman is the darkest, and it doesn’t shy away from \nemploying humor on tough subjects like depression, abuse, alcoholism and disillusionment. This \nstyle is very introspective, and it places a heavy focus on character journey, something which \nallows the show to depict Todd struggling with his own identity in a way that seems very real. \n \nThat’s a Wrap \nAlthough much of what I’ve written about has been doom and gloom for asexual \nrepresentation, things are getting better. More and more asexual artists are gaining influence in \nmedia creation and beginning to add asexual characters to existing works or create their own. \nMarks 47 \n \nGiven the accessibility and cheapness of web content for creators without a lot of resources, web \nmedia including web comics and web video series in particular has seen a surge of asexual \ncharacters as people seek to create representations of themselves where mainstream media fails. \nAs Grace from Grace and Frankie says (about recognizing sexuality in older women), “We're \nmaking things for people like us, because we are sick and tired of being dismissed by people like \nyou” (The Coup).  \nAlthough in-depth, accurate depictions of asexuality are still rare in mainstream media, \ncasual representation of asexuality is improving. Even though we don’t know their name, the \nrandom extra in Faking It, screaming their asexual pride out loud on camera, points to a small \nstep forward for the representation of this developing sexuality, as does every Poppy from Huge. \nEven Jughead from Archie Comics—despite the recent controversy with the television show \nerasing his asexuality (Alexander)—the mere fact that he was canonically confirmed as asexual \nlast year by writers after just being the goofy sidekick more interested in hamburgers than girls \nfor the last 80 years is a huge accomplishment. However, whatever the future holds, asexuality \nhas undeniably made its mark on popular culture, in a way that has paved the way for increased \nawareness of this small but growing community, proving to mainstream society that asexuality is \nin fact not just for those who are sick, dead or lying. \n \n \n \n \n \nMarks 48 \n \nWorks Cited \n \n \n@adelaideclare9, \"OH MY GOD DID BOJACK HORSEMAN JUST CANONLY CONFIRM \nTODD AS QUEER AND/OR POSSIBLY ASEXUAL I AM SCREAMING RIGHT \nNOW THIS IS A GR8 SHOW.\" Twitter, 23 July 2016, 5:35 p.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/adelaideclare9/status/756981151051444224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw \n@armofpilot, \"@SirensUSA So glad I started watching, can't believe this show is real.

    "abstract": "This senior capstone research project is a double thesis in GWSS and Journalism & Mass Communication. This thesis critically analyses the representation of asexuality in contemporary film and television and argues that popular culture often “symbolically annihilates” asexuality, misrepresenting it as a lack of social skills or as a physical or mental disability rather than a legitimate sexual orientation. It asserts that the vast majority of asexual representation in media exists through hints, clues and insinuations, not outright statements of identity, and that unfortunately, those few times characters are actually named as asexual, they very rarely depict it as a legitimate sexual orientation.  For most of its history, a lack of sexual desire has been pathologized as a medical disorder or illness, or conversely praised as a religious virtue like abstinence. It has only been viewed as a legitimate sexual orientation by researchers very recently. Given this, this thesis begins by examining how researchers, as well as the asexual community defines asexuality, and seperates it from other, terms like celibacy, assistance, or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), the largest online community of asexual individuals, defines asexuality simply as “a person who does not experience sexual attraction.” This author, however, prefer the more complex definition of “low or absent sexual desire or attractions, low or absent sexual behaviors, exclusively romantic non-sexual partnerships, or a combination of both absent sexual desires and behavior.” This definition is preferred because it places asexuality on a spectrum. It allows people to identify with varying levels of romantic/sexual attraction without feeling invalidated, and it doesn’t impose a “one-size-fits-all” definition on people who might fall in many places on the spectrum.  It also explores how different pop culture genres such as children’s shows, or comedies allow characters to resist heteronormative boundaries, and how that impacts depictions of asexuality. The analysis focuses on three works, the television shows Bojack Horseman and Sirens, and the film the Olivia Experiment, however, a host of other ancillary works and their impact on asexual representation is examined as well.  This thesis also examines asexuality’s impact on sexualnormativity. Sexualnormativity is the process by which sexual desire and sex is normalized, privileged, and socially supported Western society, it creates a space where sexual desire is invisible and inherent, a space that assumes people are “sexual unless otherwise specified,” meaning that a lack of sexual desire must then be justified and possibly treated clinically",
