Of these, the vast majority (approximately 98%) \ninvolved partners from opposite-sex relationships, while a small proportion (approximately \n2%) involved partners from same-sex relationships. Same-sex intimate partner homicides \nare generally aggregated with all other intimate partner homicides for the purpose of broad \ndescriptive analysis of the NHMP database.\nComparatively little international research has been conducted exploring the nature and \ncontext of same-sex intimate partner homicides and no research has specifically examined \nsame-sex intimate partner homicides in Australia. However, as Drake (2004: 317) argues:\nResearch about [gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered] homicide is necessary if the \noverall homicide rate is to be reduced…Focusing on stigmatised and underrepresented \ngroups…might not appear important, [but] this kind of attitude helps exacerbate the \ncrime problem and ensures that homicide will always be problematic.\nIn an attempt to address this gap in the Australian homicide literature and to contribute new \nknowledge to the study of homicide in general, this paper describes the key characteristics \nof same-sex intimate partner homicide in Australia as recorded in the NHMP and draws \ntogether national and international research concerning its associated factors.\nMethod\nData source\nData for this study were extracted from the NHMP database. The NHMP collects information \nacross all Australian jurisdictions, providing details on victims, offenders and circumstances of \nall homicide incidents each year. The NHMP database is constructed from the triangulation of \npolice records, coronial findings (including records such as toxicology and post-mortem \nCriminology\nResearch\nGrants\nNo. 469 March 2014\n2  |  Australian Institute of Criminology\nreports) and media reports. Where available, \ncourt transcripts are reviewed to confirm \nthe facts of the incident. The NHMP is an \nimportant source of information for local \nand national law enforcement agencies and \npolicymakers, and is an important tool in the \ndevelopment of homicide prevention and \nreduction strategies. For more detail, see \nthe most recent NHMP annual report by \nChan and Payne (2013).\nHomicide terminology\nWithin the NHMP, a homicide incident is an \nevent in which one or more persons are killed \nat the same place and time. This definition \nincludes all cases resulting in a person \nor persons being charged with murder or \nmanslaughter and murder–suicides classed \nas murder by the police. Attempted murder \nand lawful homicide are excluded.\nIntimate partner homicide refers to \nincidents in which the victim and offender \nare current or former intimate partners. \nIn this paper, intimate partner homicide \nis subdivided into two categories based \non the sex of the partners—same-sex \nintimate partner homicide (also known as a \nhomosexual relationship) and opposite-sex \nintimate partner homicide (also known as a \nheterosexual relationship).\nGiven that the NHMP is largely sourced \nfrom police, court and other administrative \nrecords, it is important to note that there \nis rarely specific information about a victim \nor offender’s sexual or gender identity (eg \ntransgender, bisexual, intersex etc). As a \nconsequence, the term same-sex intimate \npartner homicide is used here to define \nthose incidents where the victim and \noffender were identified in administrative \ndata as being of the same sex (ie either \nmale or female) and where they were \nknown to be in a current or former intimate \npartner relationship.\nIdentification of same-sex intimate \npartner homicide incidents\nWithin the NHMP, 25 categories are used \nto identify the relationship between each \nvictim and offender pairing. Incidents are \ncategorised on the basis of the ‘closest’ \nrelationship between any victim/offender \npairing where multiple victims and/or \noffenders are involved.\nTen relationship categories (according to \nthe principal relationship between the victim \nand offender) are used to classify intimate \npartner homicides for the purpose of \nanalysis. These categories are:\n•\t spouse;\n•\t separated spouse;\n•\t divorced spouse;\n•\t de-facto;\n•\t ex de-facto;\n•\t extra-marital lover/former lover;\n•\t girlfriend/boyfriend;\n•\t former girlfriend/boyfriend\n•\t homosexual relationship; and\n•\t former homosexual relationship.\nIn this study, homicide incidents coded \nagainst any of these categories and where \nthe victim and offender were identified as \nbeing of the same sex (ie either both male or \nboth female) were grouped and reclassified \nas same-sex intimate partner homicides \nafter cross checking with the paper files to \nensure no coding errors had occurred.\nLimitations\nThe findings in this paper should be \ninterpreted in light of the following five \nlimitations. First, despite the quality \nassurance efforts, there may be an \nundercount of same-sex intimate partner \nhomicide incidents. Due to concealment \nissues associated with same-sex \nrelationships, there is a possibility that some \ncases may have been miscoded by police \nas between strangers, or between friends or \nacquaintances. Second, as already noted, \nthe lack of specific information about a \nvictim or offender’s sexual or gender identity \nprecludes an analysis of transgendered, \nbi-sexual  or intersex persons as victims or \noffenders in homicide matters. Third, it is \npossible that the prevalence of drug and \nalcohol use among both same-sex and \nopposite-sex intimate partner homicide \nincidents is underrepresented. While the \nNHMP relies on post-mortem toxicology \ntests to determine whether the victim had \ndrugs or alcohol in their system, identifying \ndrugs or alcohol for the offender is usually \nbased on a subjective assessment of the \ninvestigating officers. Fourth, although \nthe paper uses the NHMP’s best available \ndata on mental health, it is possible that \nthe prevalence of mental disorders is \nunderrepresented. A mental disorder is \nrecorded where information is available and \nwhere a specific condition of the offender \nhas been determined. This information \ndoes not always come to the attention of \ninvestigating officers. Finally, both same-sex \nand opposite-sex intimate partner homicide \nrates per population may be an overestimate. \nFigure 1 Intimate partner homicide type by year, 1989–90 to 2009–10 (n)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n19\n89\n–9\n0\n19\n90\n–9\n1\n19\n91\n–9\n2\n19\n92\n–9\n3\n19\n93\n–9\n4\n19\n94\n–9\n5\n19\n95\n–9\n6\n19\n96\n–9\n7\n19\n97\n–9\n8\n19\n98\n–9\n9\n19\n99\n–0\n0\n20\n00\n–0\n1\n20\n01\n–0\n2\n20\n02\n–0\n3\n20\n03\n–0\n4\n20\n04\n–0\n5\n20\n05\n–0\n6\n20\n06\n–0\n7\n20\n07\n–0\n8\n20\n08\n–0\n9\n20\n09\n–1\n0\nOpposite-sex\nSame-sex \nSource: AIC NHMP 1989–90 to 2009–10 [computer file}\nAustralian Institute of Criminology  |  3\nCalculations in this paper were based on \nthe Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) \npopulation data of couples predominantly \nliving together, compared with NHMP data \nof intimate partner homicide incidents, where \ncouples may have been living either together \nor separately.\nA snapshot of same-sex \nintimate partner homicide \nfrom the NHMP\nDescriptive statistics\nAs this study is based on population data \n(ie all intimate partner homicide incidents \nrecorded since 1989–90), the following \nanalysis reports on actual population \ndifferences. Therefore, it does not \nnecessitate any statistical testing and relies \non descriptive statistics only.\nProportions\nAs previously noted, same-sex intimate \npartner homicide is a minority subgroup \nof intimate partner homicide. Of the 1,536 \nintimate partner homicide incidents recorded \nfrom 1989–90 to 2009–10 in Australia, \napproximately two percent were classified \nas same-sex intimate partner homicides \n(n=31; 2.1% cf n=1,505; 97.9% classified as \nopposite-sex intimate partner homicides).\nThis proportion is consistent with results \nfrom the United States, which found that \nof the 51,007 intimate partner homicide \nincidents recorded from 1976 to 2001, \napproximately two percent (n=1,092; 2.1%) \nwere coded as homosexual relationships \n(Mize & Schackelford 2008).\nTrends\nIn Figure 1, same-sex and opposite-sex \nintimate partner homicide incidents are \npresented by year from 1989–90 to 2009–\n10. Same-sex intimate partner homicides \nhave fluctuated from zero to four per year. \nAnalysis of any trend is limited by the small \nnumber of homicide incidents. Opposite-sex \nintimate partner homicide incidents have \nfluctuated from 58 to 92 per year, with the \noverall proportion (against total homicides) \nshowing a modest decline in recent years \n(from 24 percent of homicides in 1989–90 \nto 21 percent in 2009–10).\nRates\nGiven the possibility that same-sex \npopulation estimates and same-sex \nintimate partner homicide numbers \nmay be an undercount (as noted in the \nLimitations section), presenting an accurate \nrepresentation of same-sex intimate partner \nhomicide rates may not be possible. The \nfollowing homicide rates rely on the best \navailable data and are indicative only; caution \nshould be exercised with interpretation.\nRates for opposite-sex and same-sex \nintimate partner homicides were calculated \nbased on population estimates obtained from \nthe ABS Labour Force Survey (ABS 2011)—\nthe only official data to reflect the Australian \npopulation of same-sex couples for June \n2010. The ABS (2011) defines a same-sex \ncouple as two persons of the same sex who \nare in a couple relationship and are usually \nresident in the same household. According \nto the ABS (2009), population estimates of \nsame-sex couples may be an undercount \ndue to a reluctance to identify as being in \na same-sex relationship and/or a failure to \nrecognise that these relationships would be \ncounted in the survey.\nIn June 2010, there were 29,000 same-sex \ncouples and 5,192,400 opposite-sex couples \nidentified from the Labour Force Survey (ABS \n2011). In 2009–10, there was one same-sex \nintimate partner homicide and 59 opposite-\nsex intimate partner homicides recorded \nin the NHMP. Based on these figures, the \nintimate partner homicide rate calculated \nfor the most recent year of NHMP data \ncollection (2009–10) was 3.4 per 100,000 \nfor same-sex couples and 1.1 per 100,000 \nfor opposite-sex couples.\nAgain, NHMP findings somewhat parallel \nthose found in the United States by Mize \nand Schackelford (2008), where the intimate \npartner homicide incident rate was highest \nfor gay couples (63.72 per million per \nannum), followed by heterosexual couples \n(21.25 per million per annum), and lesbian \ncouples (9.07 per million per annum).\nGender representation of offenders \nand victims\nThe number of offenders and victims in \nhomicide incidents may exceed the number \nof incidents because some incidents involve \nmultiple offenders and victims (also known as \ncollateral intimate partner homicide).

It should be noted that one of the male \nsame-sex intimate partner homicide incidents \ninvolved one offender who shared an intimate \npartner relationship with two victims.\nCause of death\nConsistent with overall homicide findings, \nfrom 1989–90 to 2009–10, stab wounds \nwere the leading cause of death for both \nsame-sex and opposite-sex intimate \npartner homicide victims (n=15; 47% and \nn=610; 41% respectively). However, some \ndifferences were noted. For example:\n•\t strangulations or suffocations were more \ncommon among same-sex intimate \npartner homicide victims (n=8; 25%) than \nopposite-sex intimate partner homicide \nvictims (n=181; 12%);\n•\t beatings were more common among \nopposite-sex intimate partner homicide \nvictims (n=321; 21%) than same-sex \nintimate partner homicide victims (n=5; \n16%); and\n•\t about one in five opposite-sex intimate \npartner homicide victims (n=272; 18%) \ndied from gunshot wounds, compared \nwith none for same-sex intimate partner \nhomicide victims (n=0; 0%).\nA comparison of male and female \nsame-sex intimate partner homicide \nvictims’ cause of death\nWhen comparing male and female same-\nsex intimate partner homicide victims, \ndifferences included:\n•\t female same-sex intimate partner homicide \nvictims were more likely to die from stab \nwounds (n=4; 100%) compared with \nmale same-sex intimate partner homicide \nvictims (n=11; 39%); and\n•\t male same-sex intimate partner homicide \nvictims died as a result of strangulations \nor suffocations (n=8; 29%), beatings \n(n=5; 18%), other causes—for example, \nhit by a car (n=2; 7%), a drowning (n=1; \n4%) and unknown causes (n=1; 4%). Of \nthe eight male same-sex intimate partner \nhomicide victims who died as a result of \nstrangulations or suffocations, three (38%) \nwere known to have been attributed \nto erotic asphyxia according to court \ntranscript material.\nMotive\nWithin the NHMP, motive refers to the \napparent reason for which a homicide \nevent occurred (eg an act of jealousy or \nfinancial gain) or an antecedent event (eg \na domestic argument) and is based on a \nsubjective assessment of the investigating \nofficers during the homicide investigation.\nAccording to Virueda and Payne (2010: 16):\nAssigning a single reason or motive to \na homicide incident is difficult because \nthe reasons, or lack thereof, may be \nvaried and complicated. However, \nthe objective of ascribing motivation \nis to better understand the factors or \nsituations that are likely to precipitate a \nhomicide event.\nAnalysis of the apparent motives (or \nreasons) from 1989–90 to 2009–10 \nindicates that same-sex intimate partner \nhomicides occurred for many of the \nsame reasons as opposite-sex intimate \npartner homicides (see Table 2). Domestic \narguments were identified as the leading \nmotive for both same-sex and opposite-\nsex intimate partner homicide incidents \n(n=8; 25% and n=837; 56% respectively), \nalthough in most cases further information \nregarding the nature of the argument was \nnot available. Other apparent motives \nidentified for both same-sex and opposite-sex \nintimate partner homicide victims included:\n•\t revenge (n=1; 3% and n=23; 2% \nrespectively);\n•\t jealousy (n=3; 9% and n=102; 7% \nrespectively);\n•\t relationship desertion/terminations (n=2; \n6% and n=291; 19% respectively);\n•\t money (n=3; 9% and n=24; 2% \nrespectively);\n•\t other arguments (n=4, 13% and n=16; \n1% respectively);\n•\t mercy killings (n=1; 3% and n=10; 1% \nrespectively); and\n•\t apparently delusional (n=1; 3% and n=10; \n1% respectively).\nAn overview of some of the \nfactors associated with \nintimate partner homicide\nOther types of crimes and behavioural factors \nare often associated with homicide incidents \n(Drake 2004). This section provides an \noverview of some of the associated factors \ncommonly found in the same-sex intimate \npartner homicide incidents from 1989–90 to \n2009–10 as recorded in the NHMP. While \nassociated factors such as drug and alcohol \nuse, mental disorders and intimate partner \nviolence appear to be common across both \nsame-sex and opposite-sex intimate partner \nhomicides, research suggests that the \nunderlying causes of homicide can differ for \nsame-sex attracted persons.\nDrug and alcohol use\nSince 1989–90, the NHMP has collected \ndata on the drug and alcohol use of \nhomicide victims and offenders.  For \nvictims, post-mortem toxicological analysis \nis the preferred indicator of recent use, \nwhereas for offenders, the data relies on \ninformation identified by the police during \ntheir investigation of the incident—both of \nthese measures indicate recent drug or \nalcohol use, not lifetime histories of use. \nTable 2 shows that any drug or alcohol use, \neither by the victim or offender, was more \ncommonly identified for same-sex intimate \npartner homicides than opposite-sex intimate \npartner homicides (n=21; 68% and n=768; \n51% respectively). This difference, however, \nwas largely driven by a higher prevalence \nof drug use recorded for same-sex intimate \npartner homicides (52% cf 31% for opposite-\nsex intimate partner homicides). While less \npronounced, alcohol consumption was more \ncommonly recorded in opposite-sex intimate \npartner homicides (40% cf 35% for same-sex \nintimate partner homicides).\nComparing these findings with the wider \npopulation, the Australian Institute of Health \nand Welfare (2011) found that, in 2010:\nAustralian Institute of Criminology  |  5\n•\t same-sex attracted Australians were \nmore likely than opposite-sex attracted \nAustralians to have recently used illicit \ndrugs (36% and 14% respectively); and\n•\t same-sex attracted Australians were \nmore likely than opposite-sex attracted \nAustralians to drink alcohol at risky levels \n(29% and 20% respectively).\nMental disorders\nLimited information regarding the mental \nhealth status of homicide offenders has \nbeen collected by the NHMP since 1989–\n90. The data relies on information identified \nby investigating police officers, coronial \nrecords, or as agreed upon by judge at \ntrial. The triangulation of these sources \nof data indicates whether an offender \nwas suffering from a mental disorder at the \ntime of the homicide incident. Analysis \nof NHMP data showed that only a small \nproportion of both same-sex (n=4; 13%) and \nopposite-sex (n=121; 8%) intimate partner \nhomicide offenders appeared to have been \nsuffering from a mental disorder at the time \nof the homicide incident. A more nuanced \nunderstanding of the presence of mental \nhealth conditions or concerns of either victims \nor offenders is not contained within the NHMP, \nbut such data, were it to be available, may \nassist in understanding these incidents.\nData obtained from the ABS National Survey \nof Mental Health and Wellbeing for 2007 \n(ABS 2008) indicate that, among the general \npopulation, same-sex attracted Australians \nwere more likely than opposite-sex attracted \nAustralians to have experienced a mental \ndisorder in the 12 months prior to interview \n(41% and 20% respectively), including:\n•\tanxiety disorders (eg those involving \nfeelings of nervousness and distress; 32% \nand 14% respectively);\n•\taffective disorders (eg depressive \nepisode, bipolar affective disorder; 19% \nand 6% respectively); and\n•\t substance use disorders (eg alcohol \nharmful use, drug use disorders; 9% and \n5% respectively).\nWhile the results from the survey (ABS 2008) \nshow that same-sex attracted persons \nexhibited heightened levels of mental \ndisorders compared with their heterosexual \ncounterparts, it is important to note that \njust over half did not experience a mental \ndisorder in the 12 months prior to survey \ninterview (59% cf 80% for opposite-sex \nattracted persons).\nUsing an online sample of 5,476 gay, \nlesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex \n(predominantly same-sex attracted) \npersons in Australia, Pitts and colleagues \n(2006) found high levels of depression to \nexist, with 33 percent indicating that they \nhad been told by a doctor that they were \nsuffering from depression. More specifically, \n16 percent of total participants reported \nthat they had experienced suicidal ideation \ntwo weeks prior to completing the survey \n(Pitts et al. 2006).\nA number of studies have suggested that \nsexual stigma and discrimination are linked \nwith increased risk of mental health problems \namong same-sex attracted persons (see \nChakraborty et al. 2011; Frost & Meyer \n2009; House et al. 2011; Newman et al. \n2009). Further compounding this issue, \nan Australian study conducted by Dane \nand colleagues (2010) found high levels of \nperceived stigma to exist among a sample \nof 2,032 same-sex attracted persons.\nIntimate partner violence\nFor the purposes of this paper, intimate \npartner violence refers to any behaviour that \nmay cause harm between current or former \nintimate partners, including:\n•\t physical aggression;\n•\t psychological abuse;\n•\t sexual violence; and\n•\t any other controlling behaviours (see \nWHO 2006).\nQualitative analysis of available court \ntranscripts has revealed historical incidents of \nintimate partner violence between the parties \nin the majority of NHMP same-sex intimate \npartner homicide cases from 1989–90 to \n2009–10. This includes intimate partner \nviolence perpetrated by either the victim or \noffender. Characteristics associated with the \nviolence included (but were not limited to) \nlearned helplessness, jealousy, substance \nuse, constant insults, mental illness, forced \nsex and threats to harm if ‘outed’.\nSimilarly, case study analysis of nine female \nsame-sex intimate partner homicides (or \nattempted homicides) from across the United \nStates revealed that all involved prior physical \nviolence by either the victim or offender \n(Glass et al. 2004). Other characteristics \ncommonly reported across the cases \nincluded controlling behaviours and jealousy, \ndrug and alcohol use, attempts to terminate \nrelationships, and suicide threats or attempts \n(Glass et al. 2004).\nAs with opposite-sex couples, intimate \npartner violence is a serious issue for same-\nsex couples (Ball & Hayes 2009; Carvalho \net al. 2011; Pierre & Senn 2010) and there \nis a growing body of reports to confirm this \nTable 2 Drug and alcohol use in homicide incidents by homicide type, 1989–90 to 2009–10\nSame-sex intimate partner \nhomicide (n=31)\nOpposite-sex intimate partner \nhomicide (n=1,505)\nn % n %\nDrugs\nVictim used drugs 15 48 363 24\nOffender used drugs 10 32 344 23\nAny drug use 16 52 460 31\nAlcohol\nVictim drinking 10 32 512 34\nOffender drinking 9 29 564 37\nAny alcohol use 11 35 597 40\nAny drug or alcohol use\nAny drug or alcohol use by the victim 19 61 623 41\nAny drug or alcohol use by the offender 14 45 653 43\nAny drug or alcohol use by either victim \nor offender\n21 68 768 51\nSource: AIC NHMP 1989–90 to 2009–10 [computer file]\n6  |  Australian Institute of Criminology\n(see ACON & LGBTIQ Domestic Violence \nInteragency nd b; Davis & Glass 2011; Kay \n& Jeffries 2010).\nYet, there is conflicting evidence on the \nprevalence of same-sex intimate partner \nviolence, with some studies suggesting \nsimilar or higher rates than opposite-sex \ncouples (see Kay & Jeffries 2010; Messinger \n2010), while others indicate no difference \n(see Stevens, Korchmaros & Miller 2010). \nResearchers attribute such debate to the \nfact that same-sex intimate partner violence \nhas been a largely invisible and silent issue \n(see Kay & Jeffries 2010; Pitts et al. 2006).\nNevertheless, Pitts et al. (2006) found that \na high proportion of same-sex attracted \npersons had experienced intimate partner \nviolence (33%). This was most commonly \nreported among female same-sex attracted \npersons (41% cf 28% of male same-sex \nattracted persons). The most frequently \nrecorded types of violence included physical \nassault and injury, insult and isolation. Other \ntypes of violence included forced sex, \nhitting, constant monitoring, deprivation of \nfinancial independence and fear of life (Pitts \net al. 2006).\nOne form of violence unique to same-sex \nrelationships is when the perpetrator ‘outs’ \nor threatens to ‘out’ their partner’s sexual \nstatus to family or friends as a form of \ncontrol (ACON & LGBTIQ Domestic Violence \nInteragency nd a; Chan 2005; Kay & Jeffries \n2010). For instance, a perpetrator may tell \ntheir partner that they will lose custody of \ntheir children if ‘outed’ (Chan 2005). Kay and \nJeffries (2010) argued that this fear of ‘outing’ \nexists primarily because of homophobic \nattitudes in society and can act as a key \nbarrier to victims seeking support. A gap \nanalysis of NSW domestic violence support \nservices (Constable et al. 2011) found that \nthe fear of institutional homophobia and not \nbeing taken seriously were key barriers to \nvictims seeking support.\nAnother same-sex intimate partner \nviolence-related issue concerns the \ndifficulties of identification. For instance, \nservice providers can have a particularly \ndifficult time when identifying victim-\noffender dynamics; perhaps because these \ncases do not conform to heterosexual \nstereotypes of intimate partner violence \n(see Basow & Thompson 2012; Blasko, \nWinek & Bieschke 2007; Duffy 2011; Swan \n& Drake 2004).  Further, many same-\nsex attracted persons do not know that \nintimate partner violence exists in their \ncommunities and may have particular \ndifficulties identifying the nature of violence \nin their own relationships (Constable et \nal. 2011). Intimate partner violence may \nalso be largely perceived as something \nthat occurs in heterosexual relationships \n(Constable et al. 2011). As Duffy (2011: \n492) stated\nthe concept of a woman hitting another \nwoman or a man being a victim can be \nvery provoking for some people and can \nrequire a significant shift in thinking.\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this study was to gain a \nbetter understanding of same-sex intimate \npartner homicide in Australia, describing key \nfindings from the NHMP and drawing on \nthe wider literature to provide some context \nsurrounding its associated factors. This \nresearch is the first of its kind in Australia.\nAnalysis of the NHMP data showed that \nsame-sex intimate partner homicides \nrepresented only two percent of all intimate \npartner homicides in Australia from 1989–90 \nto 2009–10 and in many respects, both \nsame-sex and opposite-sex intimate partner \nhomicides shared many similar features \nand characteristics. For example, same-sex \nintimate partner homicide victims died from \nmany of the same causes as opposite-sex \nintimate partner homicide victims, including \n(but not limited to) stab wounds, beatings, \ndrownings and strangulations. Likewise, \nkey motives (or reasons) for both same-sex \nand opposite-sex intimate partner homicide \nincidents included domestic arguments, \njealousy and relationship terminations.\nWhere differences were identified, some \ntended to reflect gender norms rather \nthan relationship type. For instance, males \nwere overrepresented as offenders in the \nintimate partner homicides regardless of \nthe homicide type (same-sex or opposite-\nsex intimate partner homicide). There \nwas also a slightly higher prevalence of \nmental disorders and a higher level of drug \nuse among same-sex intimate partner \nhomicides (compared with opposite-sex \nintimate partner homicides), although these \ndifferences may only be apparent as a \nresult of the very small number of same-sex \nintimate partner homicide cases that were \nable to be identified.\nOther differences, however, point to the \nneed for a more nuanced approach to \nviolence prevention among same-sex \nattracted persons. While drug and alcohol \nmisuse, mental disorders and intimate \npartner violence are associated with both \nforms of intimate partner homicide, the \nwider literature suggests that sexual stigma, \ndiscrimination and marginalisation may be \nassociated with an increased risk of such \nissues among same-sex attracted persons \n(see Carvalho et al. 2011; House et al. \n2011; GLBTI MAC 2009; Ritter, Matthew-\nSimmons & Carragher 2012). Taken as a \nwhole, the findings in this paper serve as \na reminder of the importance in ensuring \nservices are inclusive and responsive to the \nneeds of more marginalised groups in society.\nThe challenges associated with the conduct \nof research among same-sex attracted \npersons are not unique to homicide, as \nconcealment and other identification \nissues often mean sample sizes may be \nunrepresentative, small or selective. It is \nimportant that homicide investigators, \npractitioners and researchers improve \nstrategies and data collection instruments \nto increase the likelihood of identifying \nand addressing relationship nuances. \nBy improving response and prevention \nstrategies, same-sex intimate partner \nhomicide incidents can be prevented \nand the overall rate of homicide can be \nreduced. Future intimate partner homicide \nresearch should include consideration of \ngender, sexual and relationship nuances not \nincluded in this paper.\nReferences\nAll URLs correct at November 2013\nACON & LGBTIQ Domestic Violence Interagency \nnd a.
