TheDSM-IV-TR includes the diagnosis ofgender identity disorder (GID). GenderThe socially constructed roles, behav-iors, and personal characteristics that agiven society considers appropriate formen, women, and others. People whosegender is neither man nor woman maydescribe themselves as being in an in-termediate state between man andwoman, being both man and woman,being neither, or belonging to anothergender altogether. Some examples ofgenders aside from man and woman in-clude two-spirit among Native NorthAmericans, muxe in southern Mexico,hijra in South Asia, genderqueer inNorth America and Europe, and manyothers in societies around the world.Gender DysphoriaA diagnostic label used to describe thedistress and discomfort experienced bysome trans people as a result of an in-congruence between their genderidentity and their assigned sex.Gender ExpressionAn individual’s personal traits, manner-isms, and other manifestations of gen-der identity.

GenderqueerGenderqueer is a Western term forpeople who identify as a gender otherthan male or female.Harm ReductionPolicies and programs that help man-age the potential health risks of actionssuch as self-medicating with off-pre-scription hormones or relying on sexwork for income. A core principle ofharm reduction is helping individualstake whatever steps they can to protecttheir health, rather than rejecting, crimi-nalizing, or punishing their behavior. HealthA concept of physical, mental, andemotional well-being that compriseshealth status, health disparities, the so-cioeconomic determinants of health,and health care services.Health Care ServicesServices used to protect or promotehealth, such as preventive screenings,health education, and treatment.Health care services may be deliveredin formal medical settings (such as hos-pitals or doctors’ offices), or they maybe services provided in other settingsby fellow community members (such ascommunity health workers) or pur-chased on the street (such as off-pre-scription hormones). Important aspectsof health care services include availabil-ity, quality, and cost. Health DisparitiesAvoidable differences in health statusthat are linked to persistant socioeco-nomic disadvantages such as racism,poverty, transphobia, and other formsof discrimination and inequality. Health EquityThe goal of achieving equality in healthstatus for all by promoting access tohigh-quality health care services, im-proving the socioeconomic determi-nants of health, and eliminating healthdisparities.Health StatusThe measure of an individual’s overalldegree of physical, mental, and emo-tional health.Homophobia Prejudice and hatred directed at some-one because of their actual or per-ceived sexual orientation.

Among other disparities, transpeople are significantly more likely than the generalpopulation to be targeted for violence and harass-ment, to contract HIV, and to be at risk for mentalhealth concerns such as depression and attempted suicide. Barriers to health care experienced by transcommunities include discriminatory treatment byhealth care providers, a lack of providers who aretrained to offer appropriate health care to trans people, and refusal by many national health systemsand health insurance programs to cover services fortrans people. Other barriers to health and health care are the numerous socioeconomic determinants of health thatlegally, economically, and socially marginalize transpeople. These include discrimination in employment,education, housing, and relationship recognition; police harassment, often as a result of actual or assumed association with sex work; and identity document policies that deny many trans people legal recognition in their true gender. They also include aspects of structural violence such as racism,violence against women, and poverty.Despite the magnitude of the challenges they face,trans communities around the world are building alliances to promote trans health, fighting to end the violence and invisibility that erase trans lives, and organizing for policies that respect gender diversityand the full human rights of trans people. This report presents 16 case studies submitted by organizationsfrom nearly a dozen countries. These studies offer examples of efforts, most of them led by trans peoplethemselves, to improve the circumstances of trans people’s lives within the contexts of different health systems, resource levels, social settings, and legalframeworks. The organizations represented in this report include local, national, and international advocacy organizations; health care facilities; and the World Health Organization. Together, the case studies form the basis for a set of themes that describe major areas of focus for local,national, and international trans health work and help frame recommendations for the future. Thesethemes include:• Providing health care services not related to transition, including preventive and primary care,sexual and reproductive health services, and mental and behavioral health services;• Providing health care services related to transition, including hormone therapy, mentalhealth services, and reconstructive surgeries;• Training health care providers to respect and respond appropriately to the health needs andconcerns of trans people;• Conducting public education aimed at raisingawareness of trans experiences and discriminationagainst trans people; • Pursuing community-based research projects in collaboration with trans communities and collecting data on the demographic characteris-tics and health needs of trans communities; • Organizing and mobilizing trans communities and allies; and • Advocating for policy change aimed at reformingthe legal, medical, and other structures that impact trans people’s lives, including policies re-garding gender markers on identity documents. In August 2011, a seminar meeting of the case studycontributors and other invited trans health experts provided a forum to discuss the case studies and these themes, identify other areas of work, and engage in critical conversations about strategies formaking sustained progress in promoting the health,human rights, and self-representation of trans communities. Together, the case studies and the seminar participants identified many opportunities for governments, funders, human rights advocates,health care professionals, and trans communities to advance a trans health and human rights agendagrounded in respect for the decisions that trans peoplemake about their own lives.TRANSFORMING HEALTH4Executive SummaryTRANSFORMING HEALTH5KEY RECOMMENDATIONSTo advance trans health and human rights, this report recommends the following actions. These recommendations are discussed in detail on pages 25-28. TO GOVERNMENTS:• Protect transgender people from discrimination.• Ask the right questions through trans-inclusive community research projectsand national data collection efforts.• Invest in evidence-based and rights-based programs to achieve health equityfor trans communities.• Create trans-friendly identity document policies.TO HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES: • Integrate trans issues into human rights agendas by consistently includingtrans community concerns and recognizing gender diversity.• Actively partner with trans communities.TO TRANS COMMUNITIES:• Ground activities promoting trans human rights in the language of health.• Form alliances across cultures, countries, generations, and identities to am-plify trans voices.TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS:• Train providers to care for trans people and integrate trans services into rele-vant fields of medicine.• Promote trans cultural competency.• Build trans-friendly health systems that rely on informed consent.• Use the principles of harm reduction to address the health needs and experi-ences of trans people who access health care services, particularly transition-related services, outside of medical settings.TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION: • Stop pathologizing gender diversity and trans identities.TO FUNDERS:• Support innovations in trans health advocacy and health care services.• Invest in building local, national, and global trans health movements.TRANSFORMING HEALTH6CASE STUDY CONTRIBUTORSTo facilitate the development of this report and to foster a deeper discussion of cur-rent and emerging work in the field of trans health, the Open Society Foundationsconvened a seminar meeting of the case study contributors and other trans healthexperts in San Francisco, California on August 21-24, 2011. Over these three days,the participants shared information about their work; discussed the structure, con-tent, and goals of this report; and began to lay the groundwork for a strategy tobuild closer ties between local, national, and international advocacy efforts aroundtrans health.

TRANSFORMING HEALTH7METHODOLOGYThis report is based on case studies submitted by organizations working in the fieldof trans health. The call for case studies was open between March and May 2011,and it requested case studies describing concrete initiatives aimed at improvinghealth for trans communities or expanding access to health care for trans people.Case studies could be submitted by local, national, or international organizations orindividual activists. The call was available in English, French, Russian, Hindi, Man-darin, and Spanish, and respondents were invited to submit written or videotapedsubmissions in any of these languages.The call was designed to particularly encourage the submission of projects that usea human rights approach, that are clearly driven by the needs of trans individuals intheir local communities, and that have had or that demonstrate potential for havinga significant impact on improving health or access to health care for trans individu-als. It was disseminated via email to a range of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transhuman rights and advocacy listservs that reach trans advocates, allies, and organiza-tions working to advance trans health in different regions of the world.REPORT LIMITATIONSThis report has several limitations. From the beginning of the case study process,compromises and oversimplifications that limited the pool of potential case studieshad to be made. These included the decision to disseminate the call for studiesover the internet and the limited number of languages in which the call was avail-able. The method of internet dissemination was chosen because the breadth of theinternet’s international reach was a top priority. The number of languages in whichthe call was available and in which submissions could be made was capped at sixbecause of the expense involved in translation. Another limitation noted by seminar meeting participants in San Francisco was thatmany organizations serving trans people have few resources that can support takingtime away from providing services or pursuing advocacy to write up a case study sub-mission. Seminar participants also noted that the term “case study” can be unneces-sarily formal and off-putting and suggested using words such as “project” instead. Moreover, the themes that were developed to help organize the report and to un-derstand the various kinds of trans health work being undertaken by the organiza-tions who participated in this project are neither mutually exclusive nor collectivelyexhaustive. There is significant overlap between the different kinds of trans healthwork described in this report, and it is impossible to use any one set of themes tocompletely capture the details of any single organization’s work or to reproduce thediversity of the field of trans health.Ultimately, this report cannot paint a complete picture of trans health advocacy aroundthe world. Such a task would be impossible with only one country or region under con-sideration, and the international scope of this report means that it can at best only skimthe surface of the variety of trans people’s lives and experiences and the complexitiesof trans health work. The purpose of this report is to serve as fuel for continuing discus-sions and to prompt the dedication of further resources for deeper exploration andmeaningful action in support of trans health and human rights worldwide. TRANSFORMING HEALTH8Linking TransHealth and Human RightsROBERT EADS LIVED IN A SMALL TOWN IN THE UNITED STATES,close to where he had grown up and raised his own son. In 1998,Robert, a white trans man, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. He contacted more than twenty doctors in search of care, but all refused to treat him. One doctor, in a moment of candor, told him it would simply be too much of an embarrassment for the women in the waiting room of his gynecologic practice to see a man waiting alongside them. ROBERT DIED OF CANCER just over a year after his diagnosis. In the film Southern Comfort, which chronicles the last year of his life, he reflects on the doctors who turned him away:“I wish I could understand why theydid what they did, why they had tofeel that way… But I don’t hatethem. I guess what makes me mostsad is that they probably feel likethey did the right thing.” TRANSFORMING HEALTH9INTRODUCTIONACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, the enjoyment of the high-est attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every humanbeing. But health is not only a human right—it is a powerful tool for understandingand advancing a broad human rights agenda. The power of health as a tool forhuman rights advocacy is based on the simple understanding that human rights viola-tions hurt people, make them sick, and sometimes even kill them. The lens of health,comprising health status, health disparities, the socioeconomic determinants ofhealth, and health care services, thus has a unique ability to focus attention on the se-rious and far-reaching human consequences of a lack of respect for rights and dignity. This report draws on the concept of the human right to health to identify strategiesthat trans communities and their allies are using to expand access to the full spec-trum of health care services for trans people and to help create neighborhoods andsocieties where trans people can lead safe and healthy lives. Though the field oftrans health is currently dominated by medical models that focus on mental healthdiagnoses and specific procedures involved in transition, there are equally impor-tant aspects of promoting trans health that happen outside of specialized clinics anddoctors’ offices. These include addressing the discrimination, violence, unemploy-ment, and poverty that affect trans communities; removing barriers to health care;and building well-resourced and active networks of trans leaders to guide govern-ments, funders, health care providers, and allied human rights advocates in advanc-ing the health and human rights of trans people. Fundamentally, the goal of transhealth work is to achieve health equity for trans communities—and health equity isnothing less than justice. The case studies included in this report do not describe the full spectrum of transhealth work, and they are not presented as idealized models or best practices.Rather, this report sheds light on some existing advocacy efforts and describes com-mon themes running through current work in the field of trans health. This report isintended to contribute to the forging of a global network of trans activists workingto create strategies for expanding access to health care, ending discriminationagainst trans communities, and advancing trans health and human rights by helpingtrans individuals embody the conviction that every person has the human right tolive a full and healthy life.UNDERSTANDING TRANS HEALTHHISTORICALLY AND ACROSS CULTURES, there have been many different ways ofconceptualizing gender and describing the process of creating and crossing sociallydetermined gender boundaries. However, a common thread in the experiences ofmany trans people is an understanding that assigned sex may not correspond eitherto that person’s deeply held sense of their own gender or to the gendered social rolein which that person lives.The meaning of transOver the last century, the term transgender has evolved into an umbrella term forpeople whose gender identity or expression is different from that typically associ-ated with their assigned sex. Gender identity is a person’s internal sense of being aman, a woman, or another gender, and gender expression refers to the external ex-pression of gender identity through social cues such as mannerisms, behavior, cloth-ing, or hairstyle. Some people claim a trans identity, while others are identified astrans by their society on the basis of social definitions of masculine and feminine.Gender identity is a person’s internal sense of being a man, a woman, or another gender, and gender expression refers to the external expression of gender identitythrough social cues such as mannerisms, behavior, clothing, or hairstyle.THE GENDER HEALTH CENTER PROVIDES culturally competent and affirming men-tal health services to trans people and their families in the Sacramento, Californiaarea. The center opened in 2010 and is operated by the founders of the Sacra-mento Transgender Coalition. The motivation for the founding of the center was therecognition that many mental health professionals, like other health care providers,exhibit anxiety around gender diversity and trans issues, and they consciously or un-consciously communicate their own unease to their clients. This dynamic often putstrans people in the uncomfortable position of having to reassure and educate theirown providers and may discourage them from seeking mental health services. The center provides mental health services, including letters of readiness to initiatehormone therapy or access transition-related surgeries, to trans people who are tran-sitioning. Not all of the services it provides are related to transition, however: thecenter recognizes that trans people, like the general population, may seek mentalhealth services for a variety of reasons, such as personal development, navigating in-timate and family relationships, or negotiating workplace dynamics. The center thusprovides an opportunity for therapists and counselors in training to gain experiencein working with the trans population on a range of therapeutic issues. Moreover, thecenter’s relationships with LGBT organizations and low-cost mental health clinics inthe area has attracted a diverse non-trans client population, including gay men, les-bians, and bisexual people seeking culturally competent services and people withlimited English proficiency who utilize the center’s bilingual services.IN FOCUSTRANSFORMING HEALTH10Transgender frequently replaces the term transsexual, which was introduced in the1940s to describe people who seek medical intervention to transition from one sexto another. Transsexual people are often considered to be a subgroup within alarger transgender population. For purposes of simplicity and inclusivity, this reportuses the term trans to include both transgender and transsexual people.Because of its broad global circulation via Westernized media and international ad-vocacy efforts that most visibly involve activists from the Global North and West, theterm trans has come into use worldwide in academia, medicine, the media, and pol-icy. However, it is not universally recognized, and different languages and cultureshave different words for describing people whose gender identity or expressiondoes not align with their assigned sex. The constantly evolving terminology aroundtrans identities is a factor that must be considered in organizing and public outreachefforts, particularly internationally. The richness of terms that trans people use to identify themselves reflects the diver-sity of trans communities. Trans people, like any other group of people, come froma wide range of backgrounds. They live in cities and rural areas; are young, elderly,and middle-aged; began to live as their true gender when they were children,teenagers, working adults, or much later in life; and live in families of all varieties.Trans communities are racially, ethnically, religiously, and socioeconomically diverse,and they also overlap with other marginalized communities, such as people with dis-abilities and people living with HIV or AIDS. Some trans people also have close ties with lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.Though sexual orientation and gender identity are different aspects of individualCASE STUDIESThe richness of termsthat trans people use to identify themselvesreflects the diversity of trans communities. GENDER HEALTHCENTER UNITED STATESGENDERDYNAMIX SOUTH AFRICATRANSFORMING HEALTH11identity—trans people, like anyone else, may be gay, straight, or any other sexualorientation—the discrimination directed at trans people often mirrors that directedat lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people. In fact, rigid understandings of male andfemale gender roles in sexual relationships and fear of gender diversity are often theroot of prejudice against lesbians and gay men. Trans people thus frequently experi-ence violence or discrimination on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual ori-entation, and many gay men and lesbians are targeted as a result of their genderexpression. Indeed, regardless of sexual orientation, feminine men and masculinewomen are often persecuted for how they express their gender.Discrimination against trans peopleAs trans advocate and author Susan Stryker notes, many people have difficulty rec-ognizing the humanity of another person if they cannot recognize that person’s gen-der (Stryker 2008). As a result, trans people often experience extreme prejudice andeven violence based on their actual or perceived gender identity, including discrimi-nation when seeking health care or other services, emotional or physical violence athome, police brutality, and harassment and violence on the streets. According toTransgender Europe’s Transrespect versus Transphobia Worldwide project, murdertook the lives of more than 750 trans people in 51 countries between 2008 and2011. This number likely represents only the tip of the iceberg, as it counts onlycases that were reported in the media. In 2011, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay con-demned the growing tide of violence against LGBT people around the world. Com-misioner Pillay emphasized that transphobia and homophobia are no different fromGENDER DYNAMIX (GDX) IS THE FIRST AFRICAN ORGANIZATION solely focusing onthe trans community. Based in Cape Town, South Africa, GDX provides resources,information, and support to trans people; their partners, families, and employers;and the public. A major issue for trans work in South Africa is the diversity of lan-guages and terminology related to trans issues, since the country recognizes 11 offi-cial languages, each of which has a different term for the concept of trans identity. As part of its mission to work toward a society where everyone is free to choose andexpress their own gender, GDX undertakes activities such as international HIV/AIDSawareness activities; working with hospitals around improving care for trans people;documenting and reporting human rights abuses against trans people; organizingthe first South African trans health conference; documenting discrimination and vio-lence against trans people in employment, education, public accommodations,health care, identity document policies, policing, and commenting on the WPATHStandards of Care and the GID diagnosis in the DSM. The 2010 South African Trans Health and Research Conference brought togethertrans community representatives, researchers, representatives from the Departmentof Health, health care providers, medical aides, traditional healers, and other stake-holders, including WPATH. The conference focused on six broad areas: generalhealth services; hormones and surgeries; sexual health and HIV/AIDS; sexuality,pleasure, and reproductive capacities; indigenous and traditional knowledge andlanguage; and depathologization. A major theme for the work of GDX is the degreeto which a lack of attention to the needs of trans people overlaps with and exacer-bates structural inequalities such as racism, poverty, and the broad lack of sufficienthealth care services in South Africa.…murder took the lives of more than750 trans people in 51 countries between2008 and 2011.THE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR TRANSGENDER HEALTH (COE) is based at the University of California at San Francisco. Beginning in 2007, the CoE and its National Advisory Board developed a statewide community mobilization initiative,Coalitions in Action for Transgender Community Health (CATCH). This initiative was designed to address structural barriers that hinder access for trans people toHIV prevention and health care services. These barriers include a lack of culturallyand clinically competent providers, inadequate data on the demographics andhealth needs of the trans population, and scarce funding for trans-specific HIV pre-vention activities. To address these challenges, CATCH builds local coalitions of trans communityleaders, health departments, and other key stakeholders to facilitate access for transpeople to HIV prevention services, train providers, develop leadership and advo-cacy skills in trans communities, collect data on available resources and servicegaps, and provide HIV/AIDS training and funding recommendations to state gov-ernments. The CoE also supports the local coalitions in organizing conferences andmeetings focused on trans health, and it maintains a website for disseminating infor-mation on the health needs of the trans population, particularly HIV prevention.The CATCH model has five guiding principles: local coalitions are driven by theneeds and leadership of trans community members themselves; coalition prioritiesare data-driven; coalition strategies for increasing access to and utilization of HIVprevention services, including testing, are comprehensive and include a specificfocus on particularly marginalized groups within the trans population, such as transwomen of color; coalition activities are regularly evaluated, and evaluation resultsare used to continuously improve programs and other activities; and coalition activi-TRANSFORMING HEALTH12CASE STUDIESsexism, racism, or prejudice against immigrants. Violence against trans people, likeviolence against women or racial minorities, feeds into a cycle of inequality in whichestablished social and economic structures determining the distribution of powerand resources ensure that those who have more advantages continue to profit,while those who have less are continually pushed further toward the margins. The scholar and physician Paul Farmer describes violence that tracks the fault lines ofsocial and economic inequality as structural violence. Structural violence is a broadumbrella term that includes “a host of offensives against human dignity: extreme andrelative poverty, social inequalities ranging from racism to gender inequality, and themore spectacular forms of violence that are uncontestedly human rights abuses”(Farmer 2005). The term structural violence describes the systems of institutionalizeddiscrimination that target trans people in areas of everyday life such as health care,housing, employment, education, and legal identity status. Despite the magnitude of physical and structural violence directed at trans people,there are very few jurisdictions where basic human rights protections for trans peo-ple exist, and even fewer where protections that do exist are enforced. Neverthe-less, international rights bodies such as the Council of Europe are increasinglyrecognizing the basic human rights of trans people, including the right to life, theright to health, and the right to physical integrity. The Yogyakarta Principles, whichoutline the applications of international human rights law to gender identity andsexual orientation, additionally clarify the right of trans people to the highest attain-able standard of health and to protection from medical abuses. Of particular impor-tance is principle number three, which states that everyone, including people ofdiverse gender identities, has the right to recognition as a person before the law. InThe term structuralviolence describes thesystems ofinstitutionalizeddiscrimination thattarget trans people inareas of everyday lifesuch as health care,housing, employment,education, and legalidentity status. COALITIONS IN ACTION FOR TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY HEALTH UNITED STATESTRANSFORMING HEALTH13June 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council affirmed this principle bypassing a groundbreaking resolution condemning human rights violations based ongender identity or sexual orientation and clarifying that universal human rightsframeworks include protections for trans people. What is trans health?The common conception of trans health is that it refers only to medical proceduresinvolved in transition. However, trans health is a much broader field. As the WorldHealth Organization recognizes, health is a state of complete physical, mental, andsocial well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. The full picture oftrans health thus involves broad recognition of all the services, protections, and re-sources that trans people need to live healthy lives in safe communities. This in-cludes a range of primary and other health care services, as well as a focus onsocioeconomic determinants of health such as identity document policies, poverty,employment, housing, and public acceptance of trans people. According to the Yogyakarta Principles, respect for each individual’s self-defined gender identity is one of the most basic aspects of dignity and self-determination. As such, the exact nature of transition differs for each individual, and no one shouldbe forced to undergo transition-related medical procedures as a prerequisite for legalrecognition of their true gender. Some trans people transition socially through achange of name, dress, or other aspects of gender expression without using any medical procedures. Reasons for doing so may include beliefs about body modifica-tion, concerns about being able to have children, or a lack of the resources necessaryto afford medical services that are typically expensive and often not covered for transties focus on increasing capacity for health promotion among trans communitymembers. The CoE received federal funding to expand the CATCH program toother states in 2010, and there are currently CATCH-supported activities in NewMexico, Maryland, and Florida.KYRGYZ LABRYS STARTED AS AN ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT GROUP for lesbianand bisexual women, but in 2005 the organization launched a support group forboth trans women and trans men. Preliminary contacts between Kyrgyz Labrys andgovernment entities such as the National Center for Mental Health and the Ministryof Health quickly demonstrated that misinformation and stereotypes about transpeople were rampant in the Kyrgyz health system and that few doctors felt comfort-able treating trans patients. In response, Kyrgyz Labrys launched trainings for medical providers across the coun-try, including psychiatrists, endocrinologists, surgeons performing hysterectomies andmastectomies, and other medical specialists. Since undergoing the training on transissues, several surgeons have expressed interest in learning more about the proce-dures involved in transition-related surgeries. Working with the Ministry of Health, Kyr-gyz Labrys has also developed a protocol that would allow trans people to legallychange their name and sex on government-issued identity documents. This protocoladdresses health and human rights issues such as sterilization, sexual orientation, andparenting. A major aspect of the organization’s work is documenting its activities andstrategies so that they can serve as a model for trans community organizing and pol-icy advocacy in other countries, particularly those in the former Soviet Union.The full picture of transhealth thus involvesbroad recognition of allthe services,protections, andresources that transpeople need to livehealthy lives in safecommunitiesKYRGYZ LABRYS KYRGYZSTANGENDERDOC-M IS MOLDOVA’S MAIN LGBT RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. On the initiative of a community volunteer, the Transgender Support Group was organizedwithin GenderDoc-M in 2008, and since 2009 the group has been supported byfunding received by GenderDoc-M for HIV/AIDS prevention and LGBT communityorganizing in the former Soviet Union. The major drivers behind the creation of thissupport group were the lack of legal and social recognition for trans people inMoldova, which contributes to high rates of attempted suicide and other physicaland mental health concerns; a lack of medical professionals qualified to providetransition-related care; and the lack of an established legal protocol through theMoldovan Vital Statistics Records Service for allowing trans people who have transi-tioned to obtain appropriate identity documents in their true name and gender. Thegroup has helped several trans people change their identity documents and haspartnered with the Moldovan Ministry of Health to create a working committeetasked with developing a protocol for resolving the legal issues facing trans peoplein obtaining identity documents and accessing transition-related medical servicesthat are covered by health insurance.In addition to the legal and psychosocial support it provides to trans people, theTransgender Support Group organizes information sessions for various groups of pro-fessionals who come into contact with trans issues, including social workers, medicalproviders, journalists, and police officers. The group also engages in international net-work building for trans advocacy. In 2010 it organized a meeting called “Addressingthe Challenges Faced by Transgender Individuals in the Post-Soviet Region,” whichincluded participants from Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Rus-sia, Poland, the United Kingdom, and representatives of the LGBT advocacy organiza-tion ILGA-Europe. A major future area of advocacy for the group is helping Moldovansurgeons receive training abroad in transition-related surgical techniques.TRANSFORMING HEALTH14people by national health systems or health insurance programs. For many other trans people, medical services such as hormone therapy, mentalhealth services, and reconstructive surgeries are an important aspect of optimalhealth. Professional bodies such as the World Professional Association for Transgen-der Health (WPATH) and the American Medical Association have determined thattransition-related care is safe and medically necessary for trans people whose healthand well-being depends on bringing their physical body into alignment with theirgender identity MAJOR THEMES IN TRANS HEALTHTHE CASE STUDIES SELECTED FOR THIS PROJECT illustrate a variety of strategies foradvancing trans health and human rights, including expanding access to primaryand other health care services through building infrastructure and capacity; raisingtrans visibility to address issues of safety, violence, and community acceptance;training providers to work with trans patients; and developing policy and program-matic approaches to removing legal, financial, and other obstacles to health carefor trans people. Each case study describes a unique effort to address the circumstances of transpeople’s lives within the contexts of different health systems, resource levels, socialsettings, and legal frameworks. The case studies testify to the breadth of transhealth work that is being pursued by advocates and organizations in regionsaround the world. Out of the diversity of this work, several themes arise. TheseCASE STUDIESTrans communities, like other marginalizedcommunites, faceparticular challenges in accessing affordableand appropriate healthcare,… GENDERDOC-MTRANSGENDER SUPPORT GROUPMOLDOVATRANSFORMING HEALTH15themes provide an organizing principle for describing major focus areas of local,national, and international trans health work and framing recommendations for fu-ture work. These areas of focus include transition-related and other health careservices, provider training, public education, research and data collection, transcommunity organizing, and policy change.Health servicesEnsuring that trans people are able to access the full spectrum of health care servicesthat they need, including transition-related care and other services, is a major focusof the work described in the case studies. Trans communities, like other marginalizedcommunites, face particular challenges in accessing affordable and appropriatehealth care, as the discrimination directed at them encourages policymakers to directresources away from meeting their health needs and allows many providers to refuseto treat them. Under-resourced health systems further exacerbate these challenges. The case studies document barriers to care for trans communities that are both directand indirect. Direct barriers include poor treatment by providers who refuse to or donot know how to treat trans people, the short supply of providers worldwide who aretrained to provide transition-related care, and refusal by many national health systemsand health insurance programs to cover transition-related care and sometimes anycare for trans people at all. Indirect barriers are the numerous forces that legally, eco-nomically, and socially marginalize trans communities. Such barriers include discrimi-nation in employment, education, and housing; poverty; police harassment as a resultof association with sex work; experiences of stigma and violence; and identity docu-ment policies that deny many trans people legal recognition as their true gender. InTHE GAY/BI/QUEER TRANS MEN’S WORKING GROUP was formed in Ontario in2006 by trans men and their allies as part of the Gay Men’s Sexual Health Alliance(GMSH), which is a community-based, government-supported organization dedi-cated to the sexual health needs of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex withmen (MSM). The working group aims to improve the health of trans MSM by focus-ing on HIV/AIDS prevention, living with HIV/AIDS, and other aspects of sexualhealth, as well as social determinants of health such as homophobia, transphobia,racism, and trans invisibility. Recognizing that the majority of resources and research in HIV prevention for theLGBT community focus on non-trans MSM and trans women, the group created theHIV prevention resource Primed: The Back Pocket Guide for Trans Men and the MenWho Dig Them, which is the first guide of its kind focusing specifically on trans MSM.Primed has been translated from English and French into numerous other languagesand is freely available online. In 2008, with support from GMSH, the group also con-ducted Getting Primed, a community-based needs assessment focused on better un-derstanding the HIV-related experiences, knowledge, risks, and resource needs oftrans MSM in Ontario. As a result of this research, the group recently received a grantfrom the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to conduct a study of the applicabilityto trans MSM of leading theories of HIV risk among non-trans MSM. This study willalso explore trans-specific experiences and contexts of HIV risk and examine decision-making processes related to sexual health and behavior among trans MSM. Thegroup has also conducted numerous trainings and presentations with AIDS service or-ganizations and other service providers to increase their competency to offer appro-priate and comprehensive sexual health services for trans MSM and their partners.

Together with Lyon-Martin Health Services, an LGBT com-munity health center in San Francisco, TLC created Project HEALTH (Harnessing Ed-ucation, Advocacy, and Leadership in Transgender Health) to improve access tohealth care for trans people across the state. Project HEALTH provides technical ex-pertise to clinics to increase capacity to serve the trans community, supports advo-cacy by local trans leaders, and engages in trans-inclusive health policy efforts. A major focus of Project HEALTH is addressing the particular barriers to good healthand affordable, high-quality health care that trans people in rural areas of the U.S.experience. These barriers in rural areas include few jobs and low wages; high ratesof poverty; few educational opportunities; and a general lack of health careproviders, particularly providers familiar with trans issues. In rural areas such as Hum-boldt County in Northern California, Project HEALTH operates local HEALTH Coun-cils that engage trans people, allies, and service providers in efforts to improve transhealth by developing the capacity of trans community members as leaders and pol-icy advocates, creating trans-inclusive health infrastructure, and changing local poli-cies to protect trans people. The Humboldt HEALTH Council was created in 2010. Since then, the council hassucceeded in amending the nondiscrimination policy of Humboldt County, the re-gion’s largest employer, to include gender identity. The council also worked withOpen Door Community Health Center, the area’s main source of care for med-ically underserved residents, to improve trans cultural and clinical competenceamong clinic staff and to set aside specific clinic hours every month for serving thetrans community. TRANSFORMING HEALTH16CASE STUDIESPROJECT HEALTH UNITED STATESaddition, many of the case studies describe how structural inequalities that contributeto poverty and socioeconomic marginalization, such as racism, sexism, class-baseddiscrimination, and immigration status, also prevent many trans people from access-ing health care services. Trans youth and their parents often have particular difficulty finding providers willingto take their concerns seriously and provide appropriate care. Many gender-noncon-forming young people are subjected to dangerous reparative therapies that attemptto suppress or eliminate nonstandard gender identity or expression. Most providersand health systems will not provide transition-related care until the individual is overthe age of 18, by which time puberty has already determined many gendered physi-cal characteristics such as height, voice pitch, hair growth, and breast development.Some of these changes are permanent and may require extensive medical interven-tion as part of transition later in life. Recogizing the advantages of not forcing transadolescents to go through puberty as the wrong sex, some providers have begunusing hormone blockers to delay puberty until the trans young person has reachedthe age of legal self-determination regarding the decision to transition.The case studies describe a range of efforts to remove barriers preventing trans peo-ple from accessing general health care and transition-related services. In some cases,trans advocates and their allies have established clinics specifically to offer servicesto trans people, such as the Gender Health Center, which provides mental healthservices, and Shustha Jibon, which provides sexual health and HIV/AIDS care. Inother cases, existing clinics and clinic networks such as the St. James Infirmary andPlanned Parenthood have recognized the need to provide a broader spectrum ofservices to the trans people who were already coming to them with other health careMany gender-nonconforming youngpeople are subjected to dangerous reparativetherapies that attemptto suppress or eliminatenonstandard genderidentity or expression.TRANSFORMING HEALTH17concerns. These organizations have developed protocols, many of them based onthe principle of informed consent, to guide the provision of hormone therapy andother transition-related services for trans people. These clinics also provide referralsto other providers, including mental health providers who can write the letters ofreadiness for transition-related surgeries described in the WPATH Standards of Care.Many trans people travel long distances to find clinics that can provide appropriatecare. In some areas, no such options are available at all, meaning that trans peoplemust go without care; buy hormones and other transition aids, such as injectable sil-icone, illegally on the street; try to educate providers by themselves; or find creativeways of connecting with providers who do have experience in trans care. Mitr Trust,for example, uses Skype to connect a family nurse practitioner from Callen-LordeCommunity Health Center, an LGBT community health center in New York City, witha hijra1 community in Delhi. During live video chats every two weeks, the nurse prac-titioner prescribes and monitors hormones and provides other medical advice asnecessary. Mitr Trust partners with a local provider in Delhi to make sure that labsand medications are available. In an effort to remove financial barriers to care for trans people, many clinics chargefor their services on a sliding scale based on how much their patients can afford topay. They may also work with insurance carriers and programs such as California’sMedi-Cal, which provides coverage for people with lower incomes and no privateTHE ST. JAMES INFIRMARY IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, is the only healthclinic in the United States run by and for sex workers. It opened in 1999 with the sup-port of the San Francisco Department of Public Health Sexually Transmitted DiseaseControl and Prevention Unit and provides services to current and former sex workersof all genders and sexual orientations, their partners, and their adolescent children. Asignificant proportion of the clinic’s staff and clients are gay, lesbian, bisexual, and/ortrans-identified. The decision to begin offering trans-specific health care services, pri-marily hormone therapy, was motivated by the clinic’s peer-based harm reductionapproach to providing comprehensive health care services for all of its clients. The St. James Infirmary began offering drop-in trans-specific health care duringdedicated clinic hours in 2003. In 2009, appointment-based clinic hours were addedand the trans health program was renamed the STRIDE Program. The appointment-based model allowed St. James to expand its capacity to treat trans clients, to pro-vide them with more privacy in the health care encounter, and to offer morecomprehensive primary care, educational sessions, and a fixed number of visits dur-ing the intake process for beginning hormone therapy. The intake process now con-sists of an informed consent model involving peer counseling, lipid panels, HIV andother STI testing, and a physical exam. Seventy percent of the STRIDE Program’s participants are trans women; 23 percent aretrans men, and 7 percent identify as genderqueer. The program experienced a surge innew clients when it began offering HIV and STI testing on an appointment basis in2010. Two other areas of growth identified by Saint James Infirmary are organizingmore in-house community support groups and offering services that are attractive totrans people who have already begun using hormones without a prescription. 1.

This program was establishedby the WHO in 1972 and became a joint program of the United Nations Develop-ment Program, the United Nations Fund for Population Assistance, and the WorldBank in 1988. According to the international agreements adopted at the 1994 Inter-national Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Fourth WorldConference on Women, as well as the 2001 Millennium Development Goals, thisprogram is the main instrument within the United Nations system for research andprogramming on human sexual and reproductive health. This program recognizes that each person’s free exercise of their human rights, in-cluding the right to control their own sexual and reproductive lives and to accesshealth care services, is an essential component of sexual health. Some of the humanrights issues involved in promoting sexual health that particularly affect trans peopleinclude instituting nondiscrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual ori-entation; encouraging social respect for diversity in gender identity and expression;creating civil status regulations that acknowledge the lived reality of trans peopleand allow them to change their name and gender on identity documents as appro-priate; decriminalizing aspects of gender expression such as cross-dressing; and en-suring access to and insurance coverage for all medically necessary health careservices, including services related to transition. In 2008, this program convened a meeting of international and national NGOs, aca-demics, and public health experts to launch the WHO Project on Sexual Health andHuman Rights. The first step of this project is legal and jurisprudential research andhealth insurance, to negotiate reimbursement. Frequently, however, reimbursementfrom insurance programs or national health systems is not possible as a result ofpolicies that explicitly exclude coverage for care provided to trans people. Many or-ganizations are working to eliminate these policies, as well as to address poverty,discrimination, and other barriers that prevent many trans people from accessinghealth care services in the first place. Provider training The case studies emphasize that trans cultural and clinical competence amongproviders must be addressed as part of efforts to remove barriers to health care fortrans people and to promote the health of trans communities. Cultural competenceinvolves educating providers about the concerns and experiences of trans people,as well as addressing the discrimination and harassment that trans people fre-quently experience when attempting to access health care services. As reported inmany of the case studies, many health care administrative staff and providers areopenly hostile to trans patients. According to Gender DynamiX, senior staff at amajor South African hospital where many trans people must seek care routinely telltrans patients that their health care needs are not medically necessary and are awaste of time and resources. Clinics such as Planned Parenthood and the St. JamesInfirmary and community organizations such as Kyrgyz Labrys and the TransgenderLaw Center report that even some of the most basic needs of trans people are oftennot addressed by medical providers, including the need to feel comfortable in amedical environment and to trust that confidentiality will be respected.

Tyra was on her way to work in1995 when another car broadsided the car in which she was a passenger. Emergencypersonnel soon arrived and pulled Tyra from the wreckage. A firefighter, AdrianWilliams, began to administer first aid to Tyra—until, upon cutting open her clothingto assess the extent of her injuries, he discovered that she was a trans woman. For al-most ten minutes, Williams mocked Tyra as she lay bleeding on the street, semi-con-scious and begging for help. Finally, an ambulance took her to D.C. GeneralHospital, where she was left unattended on a gurney because the doctor refused totreat “it.” Tyra died within the hour. In the investigation following her death, two ex-pert medical witnesses testified that she would have had an almost 90 percentchance of survival had she received appropriate medical care after the accident. Tyra’s story was cited by the Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico as part ofits rationale for developing a Speakers Bureau to educate health care professionalsabout culturally competent care for trans people and to provide the general publicwith exposure to a range of trans narratives. Other organizations, including theTransgender Law Center, the Gay/Bi/Queer Trans Men’s Working Group, and KyrgyzLabrys, also work closely with providers to develop trans cultural competence,which includes providing basic terminology and explanations for commonly askedquestions about trans communities, conducting training for providers and other staffon how to behave appropriately toward trans people who need health care services,and offering trans-inclusive information materials for providers to use and share withtheir staff and patients. Such materials include intake forms that allow trans peopleto list preferred pronouns and both legal and preferred names, HIV prevention andother health-related materials that include information relevant to trans people, andreferral networks that include trans-friendly providers.

These papers will be thefirst WHO publications to include a specific focus on the human rights of trans peopleand to call for international application of human rights standards to trans health. THE TRANSGENDER RESOURCE CENTER OF NEW MEXICO is the only state-widetrans community organization in New Mexico. The center’s executive director for-merly participated on an LGBT Speakers Bureau organized by the local PFLAG (Par-ents, Families, & Friends of Lesbians and Gays), where he found that the majority ofquestions were for him: audience members tended not to be familiar with trans is-sues, and many wanted to learn more. The center developed a presentation, “Transgender Cultural Competency: Trans-gender 101,” and launched its Speakers Bureau in 2009. A major tenet of the cen-ter’s mission is to work with health care providers to address disparate anddiscriminatory treatment of trans people in health care settings, so its staff membersand volunteers frequently present at medical schools, nursing schools, health clinics,graduate schools of clinical psychology, and other health-related venues. In additionto health care providers, the Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico alsoworks with law enforcement and social service providers who may encounter transpeople, such as suicide hotlines, organizations serving the homeless, and HIV/AIDSservice organizations. In addition, the center regularly holds presentations for students at universities and high schools throughout New Mexico.

The STP 2012 campaign alsoworks to secure public coverage of trans-specific health care and for the recognitionof trans identities as a human rights issue rather than a disease. In 2010, STP 2012disseminated the “Best Practices Guide to Trans Health Care in the National HealthSystem,” which proposes a non-pathologizing health care model developed by theSpanish Network for Depathologization of Trans Identities on the basis of the expe-riences of trans people in the Spanish national health care system. This guide ar-gues for removing the gatekeeping aspect of trans health care and replacing it withinformed consent, optional counseling, and the right to freely choose the desireddegree of body modification. The campaign encourages activists to freely adapt theprinciples in the guide to their own national health care frameworks. The release of the guide in October 2010 coincided with the International Day ofAction for Trans Depathologization, which was coordinated by STP 2012. On thisday, demonstrations and other actions took place in over 60 cities internationally,with more than 270 activist groups and networks from different world regions sup-porting the campaign. In 2011, groups in 70 cities participated, and over 300groups signed on in support. As one of the highest-profile advocacy campaigns fortrans health and human rights, the STP 2012 Campaign brings together trans ac-tivists from around the world in local and international expressions of global solidar-ity. The campaign is also building relationships with activists working on intersexissues and those working to end discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.Trans clinical competence is closely related to cultural competence. Many of the serv-ices that trans people need to stay healthy and to transition to whatever degree is ap-propriate for them, including hormone therapy, reconstructive surgeries, and basicprimary and preventive care, are routinely provided to non-trans people. However,providers may express uncertainty about how to deliver these services to trans peo-ple. This is sometimes due to provider discomfort disguised as concern, but there isalso little research into the clinical aspects of trans health, including the long-term ef-fects of hormone therapy. Some surgical procedures that may be involved in transi-tion, such as genital reconstruction, also require specific technical competence forwhich training is not readily available. Clinical competence challenges thus involveboth expanding opportunities for providers to gain training in the specific medicalneeds of trans people and helping providers understand that many aspects of med-ical care for trans people are similar to the services they offer to non-trans patients. Several of the case studies describe initiatives that involve helping providers de-velop the knowledge necessary to offer a full range of appropriate services to transpeople and to develop patient-centered informed consent models that emphasizerespect for the individual instead of a rigid one-size-fits-all approach to transition.Organizations developing these initiatives, such as Gender DynamiX, the Transgen-der Law Center, and Trans-Gayten, all emphasize the importance of engagingproviders in a constructive manner and building networks that share clinical knowl-edge—such as surgical techniques or recent research on hormone therapy—so thatproviders can deliver optimal care to their patients.A major controversy in efforts to develop trans clinical competence among medicalproviders is whether providers should follow specific trans health care protocolsSTP 2012, INTERNATIONALSTOP TRANS PATHOLOGIZATIONCAMPAIGN Trans clinicalcompetence is closelyrelated to culturalcompetence.TRANSFORMING HEALTH21and, if so, what those protocols should look like. Many of the roots of this issue lie inthe history of the complicated relationship between trans communities and medicalproviders. Ever since gender diversity and the existence of trans people came to theattention of Western medical professionals, many psychiatrists, psychologists, andother providers have pathologized gender diversity and argued that being trans isinherently a disease or disorder. In 1979, a group of medical professionals called the Harry Benjamin InternationalGender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA), now known as WPATH, published a set ofclinical protocols intended to guide the provision of a standard course of care totrans people under a formal diagnosis of “transsexualism.” Because gender identityis an internal characteristic, psychiatrists and other providers frequently described agender identity at odds with birth-assigned sex to be a “belief” or “delusion” relatedto an inability to properly adjust to normative gender roles. As a result, the diagnosisof transsexualism, which made its way into the American Psychiatric Association’s Di-agnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in 1980, is classified as a mental disorder. This classification of trans people as mentally ill persists, even though the acceptedtreatments involved in transition include physical interventions such as hormone ther-apy and reconstructive surgeries that lie outside the field of psychiatry. A psychiatricdiagnosis for gender nonconformity is included in the World Health Organization’sInternational Classification of Diseases, and the updated WPATH Standards of Carefor the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People stilladvocate compliance with established protocols in national health systems or healthinsurance programs, many of which mandate mental health treatment before theprovision of physical treatments such as hormones or reconstructive surgery. SHUSTHA JIBON IS A COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION in Dhaka that provideshealth services, including HIV/AIDS testing and treatment, other sexual health serv-ices, and tuberculosis treatment, to a population of approximately 2,100 hijras everyyear. Shustha Jibon was founded in 2001 by trans community members in response tothe recognition that although the HIV/AIDS prevalence in Bangladesh is low, the envi-ronment in which many trans people live puts them at high risk of a potential HIV epi-demic. Shustha Jibon’s clients are socially and economically marginalized by stigmaand discrimination; they tend to have low levels of literacy, to have migrated to Dhakafrom other parts of the country, and to work in the sex industry, where they reporthigh levels of unprotected anal intercourse with multiple partners. In Bangladesh thelaw generally views hijras as men, and sex between men is criminalized.Because of the scarcity of resources for trans-oriented public health work, the Shus-tha Jibon was originally established as a project of the Bandhu Social Welfare Soci-ety, which provides HIV/AIDS prevention and other services to men who have sexwith men (MSM). Shustha Jibon became an independent, hijra-managed organiza-tion in 2005. It now has two clinics that see more than 1,000 clients each month, ofwhich approximately 60 percent have sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In addi-tion to direct health services, the organization works to increase awareness of HIVand to promote condom use and voluntary STI testing among trans communities. Italso advocates for awareness and acceptance of gender diversity and for the pro-motion of human rights for trans people.

Trans-Gayten,the trans arm of Serbia’s national LGBT rights organization, has been working withthese providers for 14 years to improve the care that they offer to trans people fromwithin Serbia, from across the region, and from other parts of the world. This team of providers has used the WPATH Standards of Care since the 1980s, butthe application of the standards has historically been too rigid to take into accountthe reality of individual trans people’s lives. In particular, the medical team expectedthat their trans patients should be heterosexual after transition and required them togo through a standard course of transition that included genital surgery (phallo-plasty or metoidioplasty for trans men and vaginoplasty for trans women, as well assterilization), regardless of the individual’s desire for surgery and concerns about thesuccess and patient satisfaction rates for these procedures. The team also had amonopoly on the provision of transition-related services in Serbia.Trans-Gayten has succeeded in convincing the government and the medical teamto loosen the requirements for completing a course of transition-related treatment,so trans people in Serbia no longer have to undergo sex reassignment surgery inorder to legally change their name and sex on identity documents. The team nowalso accepts referrals from Trans-Gayten’s trans support group and does not requirecandidates for transition to affirm that they will be heterosexual after transition.Trans-Gayten also encourages trans cultural competence and continued training inthe latest surgical techniques for the members of the medical team.Another major area of work for Trans-Gayten is negotiating with the medical teamMany trans health advocates, including the International Stop Trans Pathologization(STP) 2012 campaign and WPATH itself, maintain that not all trans people have gen-der dysphoria and that gender nonconformity is not a disorder. The STP 2012 cam-paign further argues that any gatekeeping by mental health professionals bothobstructs access for trans people to safe and effective physical treatments and exac-erbates mistrust between trans communities and medical professionals. To addressthis issue, the Spanish Network for Depathologization of Trans Identities has devel-oped the Best Practices Guide to Trans Health Care in the National Health System,which is available on the STP 2012 campaign website (www.stop2012.info). Thisguide argues that Spain’s national health system should replace the current use of amental health diagnosis with a non-pathologizing principle of access for trans peo-ple to any treatments that they need in order to fully express their gender identities.It emphasizes that trans people should not be forced to choose only between thetwo choices of male or female, and that sexual orientation, gender expression, andgender identity do not need to correlate according to any set stereotypes of hetero-sexuality, masculinity, or femininity. In terms of clinical approaches, the guide callsfor replacing the current system of medical evaluation and diagnosis with an in-formed consent model in which the role of the provider is focused on offering infor-mation and supporting trans people in giving their own meanings to their bodies,their gender identities, and the process of transition.Not every country is in a position to move away from medical diagnoses and proto-cols. Many national health systems and insurance programs require diagnosticcodes reflecting a need for treatments such as hormone therapy or reconstructivesurgery before trans people can access transition-related health services. Trans peo-ple who do not have a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) and who cannot...national healthsystem[s] should replace the current use of a mental healthdiagnosis with anon-pathologizingprinciple of access fortrans people to anytreatments that theyneed in order to fullyexpress their genderidentities.TRANS-GAYTEN SERBIATRANSFORMING HEALTH23or do not want to access a standard treatment menu of therapy, hormones, and sexreassignment surgery are often denied financial assistance with the costs of medicalcare or government recognition of their true gender. Kyrgyz Labrys, for example, is working with the government of Kyrgyzstan to issue aprogressive protocol guiding trans people, providers, and government ministriesthrough a formal process of legal and medical transition. In order for trans people tochange their identity documents and access transition-related care, this protocol re-lies on in a diagnosis of GID and completion of the course of care outlined in theWPATH standards. In the context of Kyrgyzstan, this represents a positive step for-ward, since most medical professionals and government officials in Kyrgyzstan—asin many other countries—still refuse to recognize the existence of trans people, letalone their need for a clear pathway to medically necessary services, legal recogni-tion of their true gender, and protection from discrimination. The U.S.-based Center of Excellence for Transgender Health, in partnership with theOpen Society Foundations and organizations in Peru, South Africa, and Kyrgzstan, isworking on a similar project to develop national culturally competent protocols fortransgender health. These protocols are intended to be largely universally applica-ble, with substantial segments that can be adapted to different country settings.The ultimate goal of this project is to train medical providers in each country to pro-vide appropriate and comprehensive care to trans individuals. Public education Many of the case studies emphasize that social attitudes strongly affect how healthyand with Serbia’s national health insurance system to keep transition-related serv-ices affordable for everyone who needs them. The original medical team begantreating trans people more than 20 years ago through a government clinic, but nowall of the providers except the psychiatry team work in private clinics. The pricesthat the Serbian surgeons are able to command from wealthier foreign patientsthreaten to make transition-related care unaffordable for people from Serbia andother countries in the former Yugoslavia. MEMBERS OF THE TRANS NETWORK OF NICARAGUA (REDTRANS Nicaragua)from the cities of Managua, Leon, and Chinandega, as well as the town of Chichi-galpa, collaborated with the gay and lesbian advocacy group Gay Somotillo and thelesbian group Grupo Safo to organize a public march in the town of Somotillo. Thepurpose of the march was to raise public awareness of trans people in Nicaraguaand issues affecting them, which include high rates of violence and discrimination inaccess to jobs, public accommodations, and legal documentation. The theme of themarch was “we are not the problem—we are part of the solution,” referring to vio-lence against people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.

In many ways, public education is similar to culturalcompetence for providers: both involve addressing discrimination and transphobia byhumanizing trans people for those who may not understand or be familiar with transconcerns. Public education also involves engaging those who may not believe thattrans people deserve the same rights and protections as other members of society. Much of the public education work described in the case studies relies on personaltestimonies and outreach efforts of trans individuals or small groups of trans advo-cates and allies. Such education efforts can be broadly directed at society at large,such as the work of advocacy organizations in various countries that engage withgovernment ministries, law enforcement, schools, and the public to present transnarratives, educate people on how to interact with trans communities, and raise thevisibility of trans people and trans issues. Public education can also be conducted within institutions that provide health careservices or work with the broader LGBT community, such as the work of Trans-Gayten within Gayten LGBT, the STRIDE Program at the St. James Infirmary, theGay/Bi/Queer Trans Men’s Working Group within the Gay Men’s Sexual Health Al-liance, and the Transgender Health Care Program at Planned Parenthood. All ofthese initiatives involve familiarizing staff, volunteers, and other community mem-bers with trans issues and working to ensure that trans people and trans concernsare integrated throughout the work of a larger organization. CASE STUDIESPLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINICS ARE MAJOR PROVIDERS of sexual and repro-ductive health services across the United States. In 2007, the national Planned Par-enthood Federation of America (PPFA) developed Medical Standards andGuidelines for Transgender Health Care, a protocol to help its regional affiliates be-come culturally and clinically competent to meet a fuller range of trans people’shealth care needs. This guide was based on the Transgender Health Care Programthat Planned Parenthood Mar Monte (PPMM), one of PPFA’s affiliates in Californiaand northern Nevada, launched in 2005 on the recognition that many trans peoplewere already using its general health services and that the trans population has spe-cific health care needs that are often stigmatized, neglected, and unmet. The Transgender Health Care Program at PPMM uses this protocol as a guide forproviding trans people with transition-related hormone therapy and general sexualand reproductive health services, including birth control, STI screening and treat-ment, and physical exams. The program has spurred the creation of a Trans Thera-pist Group and a Transparent Group (for parents of trans andgender-nonconforming children), as well as trainings for all PPMM staff and trainingsfor other providers such as “Primary Care for the Transgender Community” and“Trans Training for Psychotherapists.” It also includes a mental health services refer-ral network to help trans clients obtain a letter of readiness that may be required be-fore hormone therapy is initiated. One of the biggest challenges for trans people and for providers such as PPMM hasbeen securing insurance coverage for transition-related health care services. Publicprograms in some U.S. states, including California, may cover some services relatedto reproductive health (such as Pap tests). However, they must be billed accordingTRANSGENDERHEALTH CARE PROGRAM AT PLANNED PARENTHOODUNITED STATESThere is a global lack of data on even the most basicdemographic and health characteristics of trans populations.TRANSFORMING HEALTH25Research and data collection There is a global lack of data on even the most basic demographic and health charac-teristics of trans populations. This information gap includes qualitative data about as-pects of trans health work such as important themes, successes, and challenges inenvironments with different cultures and levels of resources. The information gap alsoinvolves a lack of consistent, comprehensive, and standardized quantitative data ontrans populations, to the point where even trans health researchers and advocates arenot able to accurately assess how many trans people live in their communities or whattheir needs are. Because trans populations remain largely invisible, little heed is paidto addressing their concerns. Though trans communities can often testify eloquentlyto their own needs, governments, providers, and funders frequently base their willing-ness to pay attention to these needs on the basis of standards of data and evidencethat organizations working on trans health do not have the resources to meet. Very little research funding currently supports trans health work anywhere in the world,meaning that the body of research upon which organizations in this field can draw todevelop evidence-based interventions is almost nonexistent. The heavy burden of HIVon transfeminine communities has meant that much of the research that does exist is inthe field of HIV/AIDS. However, as organizations like the Center of Excellence forTransgender Health and the Gay/Bi/Queer Trans Men’s Working Group note, HIV/AIDSresearch done without clear principles guiding the accurate inclusion of trans popula-tions frequently results in inaccuracies such as the lumping of trans women togetherwith men who have sex with men or a complete erasure of HIV risk for trans men. Thisresults in an incomplete and inaccurate picture of HIV in trans communities and meansthat much existing research fails both to acknowledge a pressing trans health issue andto accurately describe a significant aspect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. to assigned sex, which for many trans people is different from their gender identityand which may even conflict with their legal sex if they have succeeded in changingidentity documents. Most private insurers in the U.S. deny coverage for transition-related care and sometimes for any health care service rendered to a trans individ-ual. As part of the Transgender Health Care Program, PPMM clinic staff help transclients navigate insurance systems to ensure that inadequate financial resources arenot a barrier to health care. A U.S.-BASED FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONER created this telemedicine project forMitr Trust, a community-based organization for trans women living in Western Delhi,India. Approximately twenty-five patients, the majority of whom are HIV-positive, re-ceive medical consultation via live video streaming for services such as hormonetherapy. Patients’ physical transition is monitored through yearly phlebotomy to ruleout possible health complications, and a local medical provider provides on-site col-laboration as necessary. The Delhi-based staff also includes a translator and out-reach coordinator hired specifically for the project. The heavy burden of HIV on transfemininecommunities has meant that much of the research that doesexist is in the field ofHIV/AIDS.PROVIDING MEDICAL CARELONG-DISTANCEUNITED STATESTwo of the case studies featured in this project describe efforts by trans communitymembers themselves to collect data on the challenges their communities face. TheCenter of Excellence for Transgender Health and the Gay/Bi/Queer Trans Men’sWorking Group both started with a focus on HIV/AIDS, but they are working to in-corporate a broader lens to assess the health of trans communities and to developevidence-based resources that trans people and their allies can use for public edu-cation and advocacy. Both case studies indicate that community-based needs as-sessments can be difficult and expensive to create, implement, and analyze, butthat such studies are a natural place to begin trying to systematically understandparticular issues in trans health. They are also helpful in attracting broader attentionto trans health issues, as demonstrated by the trans community needs assessmentbeing conducted by the Center of Excellence. This study is based on community-based participatory research methodology, which is a particularly effective methodfor research involving marginalized communities. In addition to the Center of Excel-lence, the community stakeholders involved in the study include the Program forTrans Latinas and members of the trans community, as well as the San Francisco De-partment of Public Health, the HIV Health Services Planning Council, and the Centerfor AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of California at San Francisco. Trans community organizing Trans community organizing is a particularly strong focus of the case studies. To a de-gree, all of the work described in this report is the fruit of efforts to organize membersof trans communities and their allies to advance trans health concerns. The strategiesbehind these efforts vary between different kinds of organizations and across differentcountries. For instance, some groups organize trans community members aroundpublic policy advocacy and public education, such as the efforts by the TransgenderLaw Center and the Center of Excellence for Transgender Health. Other organiza-tions, including many clinics and others that interact frequently with medicalproviders, such as Trans-Gayten and Kyrgyz Labrys, include a trans community sup-port group component in their work. Such support groups contribute to community-building by providing trans people with a forum in which to identify and expressconcerns and to develop personal or community-based strategies to address them. Because of the small size of trans populations and the extreme degree of marginal-ization that trans people commonly experience, building relationships with allies is acritical component of trans community organizing. Many case study contributors, in-cluding Trans-Gayten, Transgender Law Center, REDTRANS Nicaragua, and Gender-Doc-M, support their trans health activities by working with or within LGBTorganizations. Others, such as Shustha Jibon, the Gay/Bi/Queer Trans Men’s Work-ing Group, and the Center of Excellence for Transgender Health, grew primarily outof HIV/AIDS advocacy. Still other organizations, including Planned Parenthood, St.James Infirmary, and Kyrgyz Labrys, describe working in the larger fields of sexualand reproductive health or LGBT issues and recognizing an imperative to specifi-cally serve the trans people in their client populations. Over the last two decades the opportunities for long-distance connection and massinformation sharing created by the internet have substantially contributed to therapid growth of international trans health advocacy. The potential of the internet toadvance trans health advocacy is clear in projects such as the STP 2012 campaign,which effectively spreads calls to action and coordinates advocacy efforts in coun-tries around the world via online outreach.  The internet has made possible new approaches to overcoming specific challenges inthe field of trans health. Such efforts include Mitr Trust’s telemedicine project, which,as discussed previously, tries to address the global lack of culturally and clinically com-TRANSFORMING HEALTH26Over the last twodecades theopportunities forlong-distance connection and massinformation sharingcreated by the internethave substantiallycontributed to the rapid growth ofinternational transhealth advocacy.petent trans care providers by connecting a provider in the U.S. with a trans commu-nity in India. Online channels also help disseminate trans health resources such asPrimed: The Back Pocket Guide for Trans Men and the Men Who Dig Them and com-munity-oriented data collection efforts such as Getting Primed, the HIV needs assess-ment study developed by the Gay/Bi/Queer Trans Men’s Working Group. Another core principle in trans community organizing is trans human rights. Thisframework is used particularly in international organizing efforts such as the STP2012 campaign and the World Health Organization’s research into the intersectionsof gender, sexual health, and human rights. Rights-based organizing work aims tosecure and promote the human rights of trans people, including the rights to life,health, and bodily integrity. A major benefit of the human rights framework is themany linkages betweens trans health and women’s rights, poverty, sex workers’rights, HIV/AIDS, disabilities, and sexual orientation discrimination.As emphasized by many trans health advocates, a particular challenge for transcommunity organizing involves disparities of global representation. Activists fromthe Global North and West, especially the U.S. and Western Europe, tend to haveaccess to more of the resources necessary to engage in national and internationaltrans advocacy. As a result, resources and recognition frequently cluster around ahandful of voices, leaving many others unheard. Efforts to balance representation,however, need to take into account that the historical and transnational scope ofglobal inequalities, particularly with regard to the Global South and East, meansthat immediate proportionality is not possible. Rather, it will require substantial capacity building and resource transfers, and it cannot be done only on the basis of concepts that tend to predominate in social justice work in the Global North and West. For example, because America’s persistent racial inequalities are sodeeply intertwined with socioeconomic disparities, many trans activists in the U.S.emphasize race and ethnicity in assessments of representation and accountability(Hwahng and Nuttbrock 2007). Activists in other countries, however, may find differences on the basis of factors such as religion, class, or geography to be moresignificant in their local organizing efforts.Policy change As has been discussed throughout this report, bias against trans people is embed-ded in policies and practices that structure many of the routine activities of daily life,such as forming a family, obtaining an identity document, using a public restroom,having a job, accessing health care, or even walking down the street. Many transpeople, particularly those who are visibly trans, experience extreme discriminationand social marginalization. For example, the representative of REDTRANSNicaragua was unable to attend the seminar meeting in the U.S. because of the dif-ficulties she experienced in applying for a visa. These difficulties included a lack ofappropriate identity documents in her true name and gender, inadequate financialresources for application fees, and the stress of the discrimination and harassmentshe continually encountered on the street and even in government offices.At the root of many challenges facing trans people in these and other areas of lifeare policies governing how governments define sex. Sex, and consequently transi-tion, is defined differently according to different legal systems. Many jurisdictions,particularly in Europe, require trans people to undergo specific medical procedures,often including sterilization and genital reconstruction, in order to change their sexmarker on government-issued identification. Other jurisdictions, such as Kyrgyzstanand many U.S. states, have no formal protocols for granting a change of legal sexfor trans people, meaning that each applicant must gamble on the chance of en-countering friendly bureaucrats in government offices. TRANSFORMING HEALTH27For example, becauseAmerica’s persistentracial inequalities are sodeeply intertwined with socioeconomicdisparities, many transactivists in the U.S.emphasize race andethnicity in assessmentsof representation andaccountability.Another major policy concern for many trans health advocates is medical protocolsthat guide the treatment of trans people by providers, insurance programs, and otherhealth system actors. WPATH encourages providers and other stakeholders to adaptthe Standards of Care to local contexts, but concerns remain among many trans advo-cates regarding whether the Standards can truly be flexible enough to tailor servicesfor the widely varying circumstances of trans individuals in different countries. Moreover, trans people frequently reject the two prevailing international diagnosticstandards in trans health (the DSM and the ICD) as unnecessarily focused on psychi-atric pathologization of what many see as a medical condition with well-acceptedphysical treatments. The DSM focuses exclusively on psychiatric diagnoses, buteven the ICD-10, which includes many diagnoses not related to mental illness, in-cludes gender identity disorders (F64) under the rubric of mental and behavioraldisorders. Trans advocates such as the STP 2012 campaign, the Global Action forTrans* Equality, and WPATH, supported by international bodies such as the Euro-pean Parliament, are encouraging the World Health Organization to remove ormodify these mental disorder diagnoses in the ICD-10 revision process that is ongo-ing as of spring 2012. A similar effort is also underway with the American PsychiatricAssociation, which is expected to change its primary diagnosis for gender noncon-formity from GID to gender dysphoria in the fifth revision of the DSM. Some advocates argue for replacing the current mental health framework with an al-ternative means of encouraging insurance programs and national health systems tocover transition-related care. One suggestion is to use the diagnostic codes for physi-cal conditions such as endocrine disorders that correspond to the treatments neededby many trans people. These advocates also note that the experiences of trans peo-ple with mental health diagnoses should serve as a cautionary tale for all groups whowill be affected by proposed expansions of mental disorder classifications to includean ever-larger proportion of the human population, particularly in the revised DSM.RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING THE FUTURE OF TRANS HEALTH The case studies and the seminar meeting provide the basis for the following rec-ommendations that aim to promote the health of trans communities and strengthentrans health advocacy efforts worldwide. These recommendations are directed atgovernments, human rights advocates, trans communities, health professionals, theWorld Health Organization and the American Psychiatric Association, and funders. To governmentsProtect transgender people from discrimination. Governments should incorporateinternational human rights standards that include protections on the basis of genderidentity into national and local nondiscrimination laws, and ensure that these pro-tections are enforced. Guides for governments include the Yogyakarta Principlesand the issue paper “Human Rights and Gender Identity” released in 2009 by theCouncil of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. Governments should also pro-mote protections for trans people with international bodies such as the UN Commit-tee on the Elimination of Violence against Women (CEDAW) and the UN Economicand Social Council (ECOSOC), which have increasingly begun to address trans is-sues in the context of other human rights issues. Ask the right questions. Without accurate data on the health-related needs and expe-riences of trans people, it is difficult to design programs and policies that truly protectTRANSFORMING HEALTH28At the root of manychallenges facing trans people in these and other areas of life are policies governing how governments define sex.and promote trans health. Governments should invest in innovative community-ori-ented research projects and national data collection efforts that provide a better un-derstanding of the diversity of trans communities and illuminate the health issuesfacing trans people. Research entities, particularly in fields such as HIV/AIDS wheretrans populations are known to experience substantial disparities, should consistentlyinvolve researchers and community advocates from trans communities to ensure thattheir research methodologies accurately and respectfully include trans people.Invest in evidence-based and rights-based programs to achieve health equity fortrans communities. Governments should dedicate financial resources to partneringwith trans communities and other health and human rights advocates to addressthe full range of trans health issues, including the availability of health care servicesand socioeconomic determinants of trans health such as unemployment, poverty,and discrimination. Create trans-friendly identity document policies. Governments should implementpolicies that allow trans people to carry identity documents, including passports,birth certificates, and ID cards, that reflect their true name and gender. There shouldnot be any prerequisite of sex reassignment surgery, sterilization, or other compul-sory medical procedures before these documents can be updated. To human rights advocatesIntegrate trans issues into human rights agendas by consistently including trans com-munity concerns and recognizing gender diversity. Civil society organizations andother human rights advocates working in areas such as health, domestic violence,women’s rights, racial justice, police brutality, and poverty should explicitly integratetrans issues into their work. These issues include unobstructed access to the full rangeof appropriate health care services; the ability to work, marry, study, and walk downthe street without fear of harassment or violence; and the right to accurate identitydocuments. Efforts to decriminalize sex work; being HIV-positive; and being gay, les-bian, or bisexual also significantly overlap with the promotion of trans human rights.Actively partner with trans communities. A key part of incorporating trans issues intohuman rights work is partnerships between human rights advocates and trans commu-nities in which trans people are involved as leaders, not victims. Such partnerships con-tribute to broader understandings of the relationships between trans health issues andother human rights issues and help develop leadership capacity in trans communities.To trans communitiesGround activities promoting trans human rights in the language of health. Becauseit so starkly underscores the human consequences of human rights violationsagainst trans people, health is a particularly powerful lens for highlighting linkagesbetween human rights and trans issues and emphasizing the importance of the rightto bodily self-determination. Trans advocates should draw on this understanding ofhealth to promote health equity and human rights for trans communities.Form alliances across cultures, countries, generations, and identities to amplify transvoices. Trans advocates should continue to develop the potential of tools such asthe internet to bring together trans people from different parts of the world and tohelp ensure that all trans voices are heard. Particular attention must be paid to thevoices of trans people from rural areas, from the Global South and East, and fromsegments of trans communities that tend to be most severely marginalized, such asTRANSFORMING HEALTH29Governments shouldimplement policies that allow trans peopleto carry identitydocuments, includingpassports, birthcertificates, and IDcards, that reflect theirtrue name and gender.sex workers, racial and ethnic minority groups, and lower-income people. To health professionalsTrain providers to care for trans people and integrate trans services into relevant fieldsof medicine. Schools and education centers for health professions should partner withtrans communities to develop trainings for doctors, nurses, physician assistants, psy-chologists, and other providers about the range of appropriate health care servicesfor trans people. These trainings should be integrated into relevant areas of medicinesuch as preventive and primary care, endocrinology, mental health, pediatric and ado-lescent health, and reproductive and sexual health. These efforts should also supportthe creation of channels for circulating new information, building strong referral net-works, and disseminating examples of best and worst practices in trans health.Promote trans cultural competency. Health care providers, including clinics, hospitals,and individual providers, should partner with trans communities to develop and con-sistently implement cultural competency trainings. These trainings should include in-formation about other segments of diverse patient populations, such as gay, lesbian,and bisexual people; members of racial and ethnic minority groups; and people withdisabilities. Such trainings help providers recognize that these populations overlapand equip providers with the tools to more fully understand the needs of their indi-vidual patients. They also support providers in acting as advocates for trans peoplenavigating insurance programs, national health systems, and referral networks. Build trans-friendly health systems that rely on informed consent. Health system ad-ministrators, providers, and government officials should partner with trans communi-ties to develop culturally and clinically competent trans care protocols for nationalhealth systems and insurance programs. These protocols should be based on in-formed consent and should faciliate access for trans people to comprehensive, af-fordable health care services, including services related to transition and otherservices that promote life-long health and well-being. Use the principles of harm reduction. As discussed throughout this report, discrimina-tion and other obstacles prevent many trans people from getting a job, finding securehousing, and accessing safe health care services in medical settings such as doctors’offices or clinics. As a result, they may live, work, or transition in circumstances thatcan have serious negative consequences for their health. Health professionals shoulduse the principles of harm reduction to help manage these risks appropriately and toseek to connect every trans person with a high-quality, reliable source of care. To the World Health Organization and the American Psychiatric AssociationStop pathologizing gender diversity and trans identities. The World Health Organiza-tion should revise the International Classification of Diseases to remove diagnoses thatclassify trans identities as mental health disorders. Groups such as Global Action forTrans* Equality and WPATH are developing proposals for the ICD revision. Similarly,the American Psychiatric Association should revise the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-ual to emphasize mechanisms for connecting trans people with the mental health serv-ices and other care they need, rather than continuing to pathologize gender diversity. The World Health Organization should also take a stand for trans health by issuing astatement about the importance of access to the full spectrum of health care fortrans people, including care related to transition, and the importance of coverageTRANSFORMING HEALTH30Health care providers,including clinics,hospitals, and individual providers,should partner withtrans communities to develop andconsistently implementcultural competencytrainings.for all medically necessary trans health services by insurance programs and nationalhealth systems. Ultimately, such efforts to remove barriers to health care services fortrans people complement and reinforce larger initiatives focused on improving ac-cess to affordable, high-quality health care for all, particularly for overlapping under-served populations such as women and lower-income people. To fundersSupport innovations in trans health advocacy and health care services. Togetherwith governments and providers, funders should support innovative ways of inte-grating trans health and other health care services, as well as exploring how to pro-vide health care to hard-to-reach trans communities. Examples might includeintegrated primary and speciality care networks, informed consent models,telemedicine, and international provider exchanges that offer opportunities to learnabout different aspects of trans health.  Invest in building local, national, and global trans health movements. Implementingthese recommendations and developing a strong, sustainable movements for transhealth cannot happen without dedicated resources. Funders should build specificportfolios that directly support trans health and human rights advocacy locally, na-tionally, and internationally and that help strategically build vibrant trans healthmovements. This includes trans leadership development and support for organiza-tions that focus specifically on trans issues. The trans advocates whose work is described in this report, as well as the many whosestories have not yet reached a larger audience, have developed creative and innova-tive ways to tackle many complex issues with very few resources. Continuing to builda strong movement for trans health advocacy and to develop policies, health systems,and social environments that value the needs and lives of trans people is a long road.But each success in improving the lives of trans people is another success in buildinga world that truly honors every human being—and that is a world worth working for.
