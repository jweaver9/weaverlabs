He is the author of Gay Male ChristianCouples: Life Stories (Praeger, 1997) and Lesbian and Gay LivesOver 50 (with Brian Heaphy and Debbie Thompson, YorkHouse Publishing, 2003), as well as articles in journals suchas the British Journal of Sociology, Sociology of Religion, andFeminism and Psychology.2ABSTRACTReligious authority figures often use religious texts as the primary basis forcensuring homosexuality. In recent years, however, non-heterosexual Christiansand Muslims have begun to contest the discursively produced boundary ofsexual morality. Drawing upon two research projects on non-heterosexualChristians and Muslims, this paper explores the three approaches embedded inthis strategy. While acknowledging that homosexuality is indeed portrayednegatively in some parts of religious texts, the participants critique traditionalhermeneutics by highlighting its inaccuracy and socio-cultural specificity, andarguing for a contextualized and culturally-relevant interpretation. They alsocritique the credibility of institutional interpretive authority, by highlighting itsinadequacy and ideology; and relocating authentic interpretive authority topersonal experience. Finally, they recast religious texts to construct resources fortheir spiritual nourishment. This strategy generally reflects contemporarywestern religious landscape that prioritizes the authority of the self over that ofreligious institution.KEY WORDSChristianity/Islam/ Religious Texts/Sexuality/Homosexuality3IntroductionIn spite of increasing social and legal normalization of non-heterosexuality(specifically homosexuality) in western society, non-heterosexuals1 with religiousfaith continue to grapple with censure of their sexuality within religiouscommunities. Notwithstanding the gradual ascendancy of their own voices andtheir supporters’, their progressive efforts for change continue to experienceresistance from conservative quarters of the religious communities. Within theChristian community, this resistance has been demonstrated since May 2003 bythe controversy surrounding the appointment of the publicly gay Jeffrey John asthe Bishop of Reading, and his subsequent withdrawal as a result of the threat ofdisintegration of the international Anglican Communion (e.g. Yip and Keenan,2004). Such resistance is also clearly manifested in the Vatican’s latest documenton human sexuality, issued in June 2003, that continues to pathologizehomosexuality and same-sex relationships (Congregation for the Doctrine of theFaith, 2003); and the protestations against the election of Gene Robinson asBishop of New Hampshire, the first openly gay Bishop in the worldwideAnglican Communion (e.g. USA Today, 2003).4Similar discourse is evident in the Muslim community in the west, thoughnot as common and widely reported. In 2001 in the Netherlands, for instance,imam Khalil El Moumni declared on national television that homosexuality wasa disease, a sin, and a threat to social fabric, sending far-reaching ripplesthroughout Dutch society (for more details see Hekma, 2001).Empirical research shows that non-heterosexual Christians and Muslimsdevelop diverse strategies to manage the lack of acceptance experienced by themin religious communities.2 While some conceal their sexuality in religiouscommunities for fear of stigmatization (e.g. Yip, 1997), some discard religionaltogether in order to reduce or resolve the psychological dissonance generatedby the seemingly unbridgeable chasm between their sexuality and religious faith(e.g. Mahaffy, 1996; Safra Project, 2002). Some also refrain from ‘practising’ theirsexuality through, among others, spiritual assistance from the so-called ‘ex-gaymovement’3 (e.g. Ponticelli, 1996; Naz Project, 2000). Others attempt to minimizestigmatization by distancing themselves from religious communities but stillkeeping their religious faith through privatized practices such as prayer (e.g. Yip,2000).4 In addition, some search for accepting religious enclaves and thrive insuch an environment (e.g. Lukenbill, 1998; Rodriguez and Ouellette, 2000).Finally, some remain in religious communities despite potential stigmatization,with the hope to effect positive change from inside (e.g. Dillon, 1999; Yip, 2003a,2003b). On the whole, these diverse strategies reflect how individuals with5dissident and counter-normative identities manage social exclusion. Thedynamics of such exclusion is complex, and these strategies are inter-related, andtheir employment, context-specific. In general, they are employed not only todefend, but also to construct space for the reinforcement of their dissidentidentity.This paper provides an in-depth analysis of a specific strategy, whichrelates to and informs some of the strategies outlined above. Specifically, itpresents narratives that demonstrate non-heterosexual Christians and Muslimsconstructing sexuality-affirming hermeneutics of religious texts to legitimizetheir sexuality theologically and also uncover ‘queer’ meanings in such texts fortheir own consumption and spiritual nourishment. This process is part andparcel of identity construction and management, aided by printed theologicalresources, the Internet (e.g. on-line discussions or self-study of material) andsupport networks (e.g. support groups). It is important to state at the outset thatindividual non-heterosexual Christians and Muslims demonstrate varyingdegrees of competence in the employment of this strategy, dependingsignificantly, on their theological knowledge.Religious Texts as the Primary Basis of Censure of Homosexuality6Christianity and Islam are scriptural religions with written texts as the lynchpinof their teachings on, inter alia, sexual morality (e.g. Parrinder, 1996; Ridgeon,2003). Thus, religious texts constitute the primary, though not exclusive, basis forthe censure of homosexuality. The significance of the Bible was incontrovertiblyhighlighted in the recent controversies mentioned above. In the debates aboutthe appointment of Jeffrey John, both his supporters and opponents resorted tothe Bible to buttress their arguments. In their open letter expressing their concernabout the appointment, nine bishops base their opposition primarily ‘in the lightof Scripture’ (The Guardian, 2003). In defending Jeffrey John, Richard Harries,the Bishop of Oxford who appointed him, asserts that he ‘could see nothing inthe Bible’ against John’s celibate same-sex relationship (The Sunday Times, 2003).In both cases, the Bible as a divine text - and therefore of higher authority tohuman’s – underlines the discourse and reverse discourse. Indeed, thesignificance of religious texts is undeniable. Even opponents with scarcetheological knowledge often use clichés such as ‘The Bible says so’ or ‘The Qur’ansays it is wrong’, to justify their stance against homosexuality. Though lacking intheological sophistication, such popular discourse reflects its significant textualunderpinnings.Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that non-heterosexualChristians and Muslims engage with religious texts to construct space not only tocontest for acceptance, but also to generate theological capital for their own7spiritual nourishment. Within Christianity, it is widely perceived that the Bibleexplicitly or implicitly censures homosexuality. The traditional - and stilldominant – discourse of binary sexuality hegemonizes heterosexuality(particularly within marriage), and problematizes homosexuality. Biblicalpassages that are used to support this discourse are: Genesis 19 (e.g. mostfamously the story of Sodom and Gomorra), Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13,Deuteronomy 23:18, Romans 1: 26-27, I Corinthians 6:9 and I Timothy 1: 10, 18-32. In the past two decades, however, the emergence of lesbian and gay-affirming theology has rattled religious orthodoxy and offered significantresources to non-heterosexual Christians for the individual and collectiveconstruction of a reverse discourse (e.g. Stuart, 1995; Jordan, 2000), as I shalldemonstrate later.Islam, on the other hand, has a greater repertoire of religious texts in thisrespect. In addition to the Qur’an, which most Muslims consider the literal andunabridged words of Allah, the Shari’ah (‘Whole duty of Mankind’ [An-Na’im,1990: 11], a text on moral and pastoral theology; laws for public and private life),and the Hadith (Sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) are also significant. Similarto the Christian discourse on sexuality, the Islamic discourse also hegemonizesheterosexuality within marriage, and renders homosexuality a revolt againstAllah and violation of nature (Bouhdiba, 1998; Green and Numrich, 2001). Jamal(2001), for instance, argues that the story of Lot, which is mentioned in 14 of the8114 suras [chapters] in the Qur’an (e.g. 6: 85-87; 38: 11-14; 54: 33-40), is commonlyused as the basis for censuring homosexuality (Jamal, 2001). Unlike Christiantheology of sexuality, however, there is at present limited efforts in Islamictheology which offer non-heterosexual Muslims resources to construct a reversediscourse. The works of Jamal (2001), Malik (2003), and Nahas (1998, 2001 cf.Hekma, 2002) are distinct exceptions.It is important to acknowledge that, despite the sharing of sexualidentification and similarity in certain experiences (e.g. being stigmatized), non-heterosexual Christians and Muslims in Britain – and the west in general - differin some significant ways. As mentioned, the former has witnessed significantgrowth in theological resources that affirm their sexuality. Such theologicalcapital, however, is scarce for non-heterosexual Muslims. There is also a higherdegree of internal pluralism within Christianity (some argue that this is evidenceof secularization), compared to Islam, which opens up more space for dissidentidentities and alternative religious practices. Indeed, Islam in the west, being aminority religion, also heightens expectation of adherence and conformity, as aform of cultural defence (Bruce, 2002; Roald, 2001). Further, Islam plays asignificant role in ethnic identification among British Muslims, who are primarilyof South Asian origin. Within the Muslim community, homosexuality is widelyperceived as a ‘western disease’, a natural outcome of the west’s secularity andcultural degeneracy (Naz Project, 1999; Yip, 2004). Non-heterosexual Christians9are generally spared of such cultural complexities that significantly informidentity construction. In addition, Muslims face much prejudice in westernsocieties, evidenced, for instance, in debates around state aid to Islamic schoolsand the wearing of hijab in school. Some argue that such prejudice hasproliferated since the unfortunate event of September 11 (e.g. Fetzer and Soper,2003). Finally, non-heterosexual Christians also have substantially moreestablished support networks compared to non-heterosexual Muslims.5 This hasa significant impact on the availability of religious and social capital for identityconstruction and management. In short, it is important to be aware of thedifferences in the social positions of these two groups. Nevertheless, they all facevarying degrees of religious exclusion on the ground of their sexuality.In this specific strategy of queering religious texts, Goss (2002), withspecific reference to Christian texts, argues that to ‘queer’ is ‘to spoil or interferewith’ (p. xiv). Queering religious texts, therefore, has a de-stabilizing effect,through the transgression and de-construction of naturalized and normalizedhermeneutics, which reinforces heteronormativity. As I shall demonstrate,queering exposes the socio-cultural embededness and temporal specificity of thetexts, as well as the ideological framework of the authority that constructs suchhermeneutics. This strategy, closely informed by and intertwined withtheological resources, can be divided into three approaches: (i) Critique oftraditional interpretation of specific passages in the texts; (ii) Critique of10interpretative authority of religious authority structures and figures; and (iii) Re-casting religious texts. Before discussing these approaches, I shall first provide abrief account of the research.The ResearchThe qualitative data presented in this paper are drawn from two separate butconceptually-related projects. The first project, conducted in 1997-1998, involvesin-depth interviews with 25 women and 36 men who are self-identified Christianand lesbian/gay/bisexual. The second project, on non-heterosexual Muslims,involves in-depth interviews with 20 women and 22 men, and two focus groups,conducted in 2001-2002. Both projects aim to examine three levels of theparticipants’ life circumstances and lived experiences. These levels are: (i)individual (e.g. how they reconcile the seemingly contradictory sexual andreligious dimensions of their identity); (ii) interpersonal (e.g. how they organizesocial relations with potentially stigmatizing social audiences such as thereligious community and family); and (iii) intergroup (e.g. how they access andmanage involvement in support networks). This paper, however, focuses only onthe individual level.In view of the ‘hidden population’ status of the participants (particularlyin the case of non-heterosexual Muslims), a variety of sampling methods were11employed to construct non-probability convenience samples. These methods are:support group networks, non-heterosexual Press, personal networks,snowballing, and publicity in non-heterosexual events/meetings.There are similarities between the two samples, for instance, the majorityof them live in Greater London and the Southeast of England (71% non-heterosexual Muslims and 80% of non-heterosexual Christians). They are highlyeducated (52% of non-heterosexual Muslims and 89% of non-heterosexualChristians have at least a first degree), and the majority are in full-timeemployment (76% of non-heterosexual Muslims and 72% of non-heterosexualChristians). Almost all of the non-heterosexual Christian sample are white (97%),but none of non-heterosexual Muslim are, with 88% of South Asian origin.Further, 64% of the non-heterosexual Muslim is under the age of 30, but only48% on the non-heterosexual Christian sample is in this category.Critique of Traditional Interpretation of Specific Textual Passages: ADefensive ApproachAs mentioned above, a vast majority of the participants acknowledge thathomosexuality is presented in a negative light in some parts of religious texts.Thus, this approach focuses on alternative textual interpretations with theprimary objective to defend the acceptability of their sexuality, drawing upon12theological resources, of which the participants demonstrate varying degrees ofknowledge. In general, there are two dimensions to this defensive approach.(a) Engagement within the framework of this specific corpus of textual material,by constructing an alternative and sexuality-affirming interpretation.Through this, the participants expose the inaccuracy of traditional interpretation,attempting to undermine its theological credibility and moral authority, and inreturn, enhance their own. One of the most commonly used passages in thecensure of homosexuality in both Christianity and Islam is the story of Sodomand Gomorra in relation to Lot, Abraham’s cousin (Genesis 19 of the Bible andsuras 6 and 38 of the Qur’an). In both theological and popular discourses, thedestruction of Sodom and Gomorra is often used as evidence of God’spunishment for the ‘sinful’ same-sex sexual acts that occurred. Therefore, it isunsurprising that participants take issue with such interpretation, asdemonstrated by the following narratives:The traditional interpretation of those passages that appear to speak againsthomosexuality is not accurate. I have read enough in this area to be convincedthat the Church has got it wrong. They misunderstood male prostitution ashomosexuality, for example [referring to Deuteronomy 23:18]. You get peoplewho argue that ‘Oh, Sodom and Gomorra is the story about God’s punishment13for gay people.’ That’s bullshit. There are tons of good books out there now toshow that actually it is about inhospitality. (Sandra, a lesbian Christian in her30s)I had assumed, like most Muslims, that Islam was very homophobic and thepenalty for being gay was death. But I have since done some reading anddiscussed it a lot with people who know more about Islam than I do. I now knowthat there are various interpretations of what the Qur’an says… I turned to thepassage most Muslims would turn to – the story of the Prophet of Lot. I read andre-read it in English and Arabic, because it didn’t occur to me that it wasreferring to sexuality at all…. So, as I discussed it more [on-line and in a supportgroup] and read more, I became convinced by the argument that the passagedidn’t refer specifically to homosexuality, but to various things like inhospitalityand the [negative] treatment of guests. That was a huge sense of relief! (Jamila, aself-identified queer Muslim in her 20s)The above narratives are clearly informed by lesbian and gay-affirming theology.This body of theology – which often examines original languages of the texts -has argued that the destruction of the cities was actually due to inhospitality tostrangers and sexual violence (e.g. Goss, 2002; Jamal, 2001; Nahas, 1998). In thesame vein, Nahas (1998, 2001) argues that although the Shar’iah is generallynegative towards homosexuality, it also mentions that same-sex sexual acts areonly punishable if they are observed by four witnesses. This problematizes the14Islamic position on homosexual acts in private, particularly within the context ofa loving and committed relationship.Evidently, the participants engage with such alternative theologicalmaterial to undermine the basis of the traditional interpretation that stigmatizeshomosexuality. Significantly, they do not challenge the content of the religioustexts, thus respecting their sanctity. However, they contest the accuracy andtherefore the hegemony of the traditional interpretation of such texts. Throughthis, they construct themselves as victims (and indeed survivors) of religiousignorance and prejudice.(b) Contextualizing the textual material by highlighting its historic and culturalspecificity, thus its inapplicability to contemporary socio-cultural context.Here, the participants highlight the cultural and historical specificity oftraditional interpretation of homosexuality, which might appear negative, butare nevertheless inapplicable to contemporary society with its modernunderstanding of the diversity of human sexuality. In other words, theychallenge the inerrancy and the literal usage of such texts, on the basis that textsare discursively produced, therefore historical, temporal, and cultural specificitymust be emphasized. Ian, a gay priest in his 50s, asserts the importance of suchcontextualization.15So what if the Bible says some negative things about homosexuality? It waswritten ages ago, when people did not have the scientific knowledge we nowhave about human sexuality. The culture was so rigid then when it comes to sex.How could you apply the standards and norms then to our life now? We havemoved on. We should move on from that…. I think that’s the problem. TheChurch thinks that our understanding of sexuality doesn’t change, or shouldn’tchange. But we do change, as individuals and a society.Ian’s argument is consistent with that of Shazia, a lesbian Muslim in her 30s:I always question the Hadith, because the earliest Hadith was written 300 to 400years after the death of the prophet Muhammad. So how true can that be? And atthat time there was a lot of political people in Islam and Islamic tribes, so a lot ofHadith were written in a time of political upheaval, [with the] pressures tocontain [a] society that needs order, rules, regulations… The Shari’ah has comefrom the Hadith and also the Qur’an. But the Shari’ah has a lot to do with menspecifically, and people controlling the masses. The Shari’ah has gone a long wayto continue the bigotry and prejudice that lies in our Islamic cultures today, onhomosexuality and many other subjects such as women.These narratives resonate with the postmodernist approach that ‘queer’theologians favour, that knowledge is discursively produced, and should not be16universalized and generalized across time and space. For instance, lesbian andgay-affirming Christian theologians (e.g. Stuart, 2003) have argued that Leviticus18:22 and 20:13 do not condemn sex between men. Rather, they censure ‘a manlying with a man as a woman’ (taking on the female role), which reflects socio-cultural significance and rigid symbolism of gender-specific sex roles within aparticular historical context. Similarly, they assert that homosexual acts that theApostle Paul censures (e.g. Romans 1: 26-27; I Corinthians 6:9) actually refer tocult prostitution, which should have no bearing on contemporary same-sexrelationships.Within Islam, An-Na’im (1990) – with specific reference to civil liberties, humanrights and international laws - asserts that the Shari’ah was developed based onMuslims’ experience and understanding in Medina in 7th century. Far from beingdivine and immutable, the Shari’ah is constructed, based on human interpretationof other Islamic sources within a specific cultural and historical context.Therefore, the interpretation and practice of it needs to be contextualized, as longas it is consistent with fundamental sources of Islam. Although An-Na’im makesno reference to sexuality in his arguments, works such as his contributesindirectly to non-heterosexual Muslims’ consideration of Islamic written sources.In sum, this defensive approach aims to defend the participants’ sexualityby engaging with the same textual material, but offering an alternative de-17stigmatizing light. Further, temporal and socio-cultural relevance is greatlyemphasized. On the whole, it is a form of defensive apologetics. This iscomplemented by an offensive approach, to which I now turn.Critique of Interpretive Authority of Religious Authority Structures: AnOffensive ApproachGiven the perceived divine authority of religious texts, it is unsurprising thatreligious authority structures employ them to buttress the absolutism of theirown moral authority. Against this backdrop, the participants launch an offensiveagainst religious authority structures and figures, so as to discredit theircredibility and moral authority, and in turn weaken their discourse.Underpinning this approach is the argument that the engagement with textscannot be separated from the power behind the interpretation and propagation.There are two dimensions to this approach, raised by participants, which againappear to be informed by lesbian and gay-affirming theology.(a) Deconstructing and challenging the hegemonic discourse of religiousauthority structures.18This dimension emphasizes the heterosexist bias embedded in the interpretationof religious texts and institutional pronouncements that censure homosexuality,as illustrated in the following narrative:I feel sometimes, all these people who issue these hard-line statements againsthomosexuality are repressed homosexuals themselves. To them homophobia isthe biggest shield for their own [homo]sexuality. I mean, if you go to any littletown in any Muslim country, the religious leaders are always involved withhomosexuality. Imams have bad reputation in Pakistan in certain districts…. forhaving sex with men. (Omar, a gay Muslim in his late 20s)Omar might have exaggerated his observation. However, the thrust of hisargument discredits the assumed intellectual and moral objectivity of religiousauthority figures. Empirical research has shown that younger Muslims in thewest do challenge imams from their countries of origin (who are often not fluentin western languages) who attempt to re-enact the traditional version of Islam,which in their view, may not be totally appropriate for their western socialenvironment (e.g. Smith, 2002). The employment of this offensive is also evidentamong non-heterosexual Christians, such as Margaret, a bisexual Christian in her40s:19I think the Church generally does not know how to deal with issues aboutsexuality, or anything to do with the body really. I think the Church is doingmore damage than good, both to itself and the people it’s supposed to be caringfor. I often ask myself why I don’t just walk away.Besides undermining the moral credibility and intellectual objectivity of religiousauthority structures, the participants are also highly critical of their ‘selectivefundamentalism’, namely their focus on homosexuality, and neglect of other‘abominations’ mentioned in religious texts (e.g. wearing a mixed fibre jacket andeating shellfish).This method is consistent with that widely used by feminist Christiansand Muslims to challenge andocentric and patriarchal hermeneutics of religioustexts and the construction of sexist theology (e.g. Mernissi, 1991; Jobling, 2002).By expressing doubt over religious authority structures and their discourse, theparticipants argue for the reliance on their own reasoning as the definitiveinterpretive authority of religious texts, to which I now turn.(b) Relocating interpretive authority from institution to the self.Having discredited the interpretive authority of religious authority structures,the participants relocate this authority to their self, using their personalexperience as non-heterosexual believers as the interpretive lens. In this case,20queering texts means personalizing and individualizing the interpretation oftexts, by adopting a hermeneutic lens based on the authority of self. Thefollowing narratives demonstrate this:Anyone who goes to the Qur’an as a text is reading it… through theirunderstanding of that reading. It’s how you perceive the text. So between tenpeople who read the same sentence, we can perceive it in ten different ways…So [the Shari’ah] are man made laws and they have come through malereasoning and interpretation. Do I wish to live my life according to that?Certainly not… For me it’s much more a personal thing. (Hasima, a lesbianMuslim in her early 20s)I think at the end of the day, my experience as a lesbian Christian willdetermine how I live. Okay, I listen to what the Church or Christian traditionshave to say about sexuality and other things. I also read the Bible. But at theend of the day, it’s our conscience that counts, isn’t it? Who is the Church to tellme that my life is a mistake? Yes, I did screw things up. But now I am happy asI am. The relationship with [her partner] has a lot to do with it…. So yes, myreference point is my own experience. (Sally, in her 40s)These narratives illustrate clearly the participants’ attempt to bring their self intothe reading of texts. Such religious individualism, for non-heterosexuals withreligious faith, is often a dissident identity management strategy (Wilcox, 2002,212003; Yip, 2002, 2003a). Reading religious texts, therefore, becomes an exercise toseek guidance rather than approval, as they learn to trust their personalexperiences as the ‘spirit of truth’ (Stuart, 1997a: 20; See also Stuart, 2003). It isimportant to acknowledge that the participants – in line with lesbian and gaytheology – generally do not discount the value, relevance and indeed sanctity ofthe texts. However, they wrestle the authentic interpretive authority fromreligious authority structures and relocate it to their self – their own reflection,evaluation, and experience. This is consistent with Koch’s (2001) encouragementto non-heterosexual Christians to ‘cruise’ the texts, with their personalexperience in the driving seat in the journey of textual exploration. The practiceof this is elaborated in the next approach.Re-casting Religious Texts: A Creative ApproachCompared to the first two, this approach is the least commonly used andsophisticated, primarily because the theological capital that underpins it is themost recently developed. Significantly, this approach moves beyond theframework of the moral debate about homosexuality, in which the first twoapproaches are embedded. Here, the participants focus on using the texts forspiritual growth. This approach, however, is significantly uncommon amongnon-heterosexual Muslims at present. This, as mentioned, is a reflection of the22significant discrepancy in theological and cultural resources between them andtheir Christian counterparts. There are two dimensions to this approach.(a) ‘Outing’ the textsGoss (2002) defines ‘outing’ religious texts as the attempt to discover queervoices in them, and use them to inform non-heterosexual Christian living. Inother words, accounts of same-sex intimacy and love are embedded withinreligious texts, but have been silenced. Such ‘subjugated knowledge’ ought to beused not only to justify same-sex intimacy and love, but also offer insights intodynamics of same-sex intimacy. Biblical accounts of the relationships of Naomiand Ruth (the book of Ruth), Jonathan and David (1 and 2 Samuel), and Jesusand his disciples (the Gospel of John) are commonly used (e.g. Stuart, 2003).John, a gay Christian in his 50s, demonstrates his employment of such‘subjugated knowledge’:I draw so much comfort and confidence from the intimacy between David andJonathan, or Ruth and Naomi. Their stories show us that same-sex love ispossible [and] there is no need to be ashamed of it…. Jesus himself was so closeto his disciples. I have read that there are probably homosexual feelingsbetween them. I think he opened the door for us. No need to be ashamed,23really. I think we should focus on learning from these examples and enrich ourown relationships.(b) ‘Befriending’ the textsIn this related dimension, the participants attempt to uncover implicitnon-heterosexual subjectivity within the texts. A good example of this is theirattempt to ‘queer’ Christ by focusing on his humanity, emphasizing his role as achampion of victims of social injustice and a radical political activist whotransgressed traditional social order and power structure. Through this, thesolidarity between Christ and non-heterosexual as the oppressed is established.Thus, Christ’s suffering, as Goss (2002) argues, encompasses non-heterosexuals’suffering; and gay bashing becomes Christ bashing. The following narrativeillustrates this central point:I see Jesus as a champion for marginalized people, like poor people, blackpeople, and gay people. I really believe in it. He wasn’t afraid of authority andreally spoke his mind to defend social justice. I know deep inside that heunderstands me and knows the pains I go through [she is not open about hersexuality in the church for fear of rejection]. Hopefully, one day I feel strongenough to stand up and be counted in the church. I really hope so. (Maria, alesbian Christian in her late 30s)24This view of Christ is prevalent among non-heterosexual Christians (e.g. Yip,2003b). Another less common identification with Christ centers on his sexuality,as James, a gay Christian in his early 60s, asserts:Yes, Jesus is the Son of God. But he was also human. He felt pain when he wascrucified. He had desires and urges like you and me. I think he must have hadsexual feelings too. Otherwise, how could he be totally human like you andme? You see? I think he must have felt sexually attracted to people around him,maybe his own disciples too.James’ argument is consistent with theological efforts to construct Christ as asexual being, which challenges the traditional conception of him as asexual orcelibate (e.g. in emphasizing Christ’s supposedly homoerotic relationship withMark and Lazarus. See, for example, Bohache, 2003; Goss, 2002). This explicitallusion to Christ’s sexuality accentuates his humanity, since being sexual is partand parcel of being human.Another central Biblical figure who has been subjected to such ‘queering’,albeit to a much lesser extent, is the Apostle Paul. This is not surprising as someof his epistles are commonly used to justify the censure of homosexuality. Joy, alesbian Christian who is clearly informed by Spong’s (1991) controversial claimthat Paul was ‘gay’, argues:25I have read books which claim that Paul was gay himself. But he couldn’texpress it, you know, at the time. [It] must be tough for gay people then…. Sowe can understand why he is so negative about homosexuality in the Bible. Ithink he hated himself for being gay.By constructing the texts ‘gay-friendly’ through the reading of them from a queersocial location, the texts are transformed into not only narratives of resistance(against censure), but also narratives of spiritual nourishment. This processpromotes truth-claims that affirm their identity as well as nourishing theirspirituality. Koch (2001), for instance, argues that non-heterosexual Christiansshould move away from the hermeneutical paradigm to defend themselvesagainst traditional interpretation of religious texts. Instead, they should use a‘homoerotic approach’ that stems from internal knowledge – the self – which‘“cruises” the Bible for pleasure and moments of delightful encounter with thosecharacters and stories which offer moments of identification, point of connectionand the possibility of transformation’ (p. 10).Injecting ‘queer’ meanings to texts, therefore, becomes an importantcomponent of this process. For instance, there are efforts to inject homoeroticisminto Song of Songs, the treatise to love in the Old Testament (e.g. King, 2000;Moore, 2001). The keyword in this effort is ‘reclaiming’, which signifies their26intention to reclaim space that has been eradicated through traditionalheterosexist hermeneutics.Such ‘befriending’ of religious texts is relatively absent in Islamic theologyand among non-heterosexual Muslims. The social position of homosexualitywithin the Muslim community and Islamic theological discourses means thatnon-heterosexual Muslims have only recently begun the defensive – and to amuch lesser extent, the offensive – approaches discussed above.Beyond central religious texts, lesbian and gay-affirming Christiantheology has also developed texts to affirm same-sex rituals, drawing upon theBible and other sources (e.g. Stuart, 1992; Kittredge and Sherwood, 1995). Asmall minority of participants report that they have used such texts to celebratetheir relationships.ConclusionsChristian and Islamic religious texts have played a primary role in the censure ofhomosexuality. Not surprisingly, radical lesbian and gay theologians have calledthem ‘texts of terror’ that commit ‘textual violence’ to non-heterosexual believers,making them victims of ‘biblical terrorism’ (e.g. Goss, 1993; 2002). Whileparticipants of these research projects were less radical and forceful in theirarticulation of this issue, they nevertheless engage with such texts to construct27sexuality-affirming hermeneutics, involving not just the texts, but also theinterpretative authority of such texts. By no means do I claim that suchendeavour is peculiar to contemporary society. What is significant is that, incontemporary society, social processes such as de-traditionalization andindividualization increasingly empower the self over the institution as the basis ofsuch self-directed hermeneutics which constitutes identity construction, a themethat I shall elaborate later.In this respect, this paper has highlighted three multi-dimensionalapproaches - defensive, offensive and creative. Significantly, the engagementwith such texts highlights the participants’ view about their continued relevanceto contemporary society. Nevertheless, such texts are no longer treated as aninfallible prescriptive moral template, but as a set of moral guidelines with, atbest, an advisory role. The reflection and evaluation of such texts, and thepractice of principles gained from them, is no longer the preserve of religiousauthority structures, but their own. This process humanizes the texts,emphasizing the believer’s moral right to choose and select from a repertoire,rather than being constrained by it (Dufour, 2000; Wilcox, 2002, 2003). Thus, theempirical ‘what is’ (based on personal experience) is prioritized over thetheological ‘what ought to be’ (i.e. institutional perspective) (McFadyen, 2000).In doing so, the participants bring the texts in line with their livedexperiences by bringing the self into the reading (Stuart, 1997b; Stone, 2001a).28This is reflective of recent development in biblical hermeneutics (less so inQur’anic hermeneutics) in which ‘readers also bring a particular “self” to the textwhich is shaped by a variety of factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, class,religious affiliations, socioeconomic standing, education, and we would add,sexual orientation’ (Goss and West, 2000: 4). In the same vein, Lozada (2000) hasargued that biblical interpretation is not independent of one’s identity, and theidentity of the interpreter is interconnected with the production of meaning.On the whole, this strategy highlights the discursiveness, situatedness andfluidity of religious texts – their meanings and teachings. By transgressingtraditional discourse, such attempts are rebellious, liberative, as well aspersonally and socially transformative. In many ways, the fundamentaloperational principle of this strategy is not new. Feminist, black, post-colonialand liberation theologies, to name a few, have all attempted to contest boundarylegitimized by patriarchal, sexist, Eurocentric, and middle-class hermeneutics(e.g. Roald, 1997; Beaman, 1999; Gutierrez, 2001; Althaus-Reid, 2003). Indeed, asBardella (2001: 117) argues, this is a kind of liberation theology that aims to‘theologically recontexualize the metaphysical dimension of homosexuality, toconstruct a spiritual discourse that includes lesbians and gays’. In this, we cansee the intersection of the secular, the political, the theological, and the personal.Like other socially disadvantaged social groups whose voices are marginalizedin religious communities, non-heterosexual Christians and Muslims, in the29words of Johnson (2003: 166), attempt to insert their pictures into their ‘faithfamily photo album, not as apologia, but a gift to the tradition.’This strategy is not without its critics. For instance, the third – creative –approach to ‘out’ and ‘befriend’ texts has been criticized for imposing thecontemporary template of sexuality and identity on the Apostle Paul and Christ,thus making the same mistake of cultural blindness which they critique. Stone(2001b) also argues that there is not, and should not be, a single ‘queer method’,which assumes uniformity among people who share the same label or sociallocation. Religious, material, and cultural diversity within the non-heterosexualcommunity makes such a strategy rather limited. Further, the current ‘queeringthe text’ strategy has been criticized for being excessively individualistic andpersonalistic – even narcissistic – and devoid of political and historical contextand meaning.Nevertheless, Bowler’s (1991, cf. Ford, 1999:136) powerful wordssuccinctly underline the participants’ need to undermine the presumedinfallibility of religious authority structures and their interpretative objectivity:The consequences of treating the scripture as though history and personalitymade no difference to the words and content of scripture have been, in Christianhistory, horrendous. By lifting a text from its content and treating it as a timelesstruth, Christians claimed scriptural warrant for their murder of Jews (Matthew27:25); by lifting a text, Christians found warrant for burning women whom they30regarded as witches (Exodus 22:18); by lifting a text, Christians justified slaveryand apartheid (Genesis 9: 25); by lifting a text, Christians found justification forexecuting homosexuals (Leviticus 20:13); by lifting a text (Genesis 3:16),Christians found warrant for the subordination of women to men, so that theycame to be regarded as ‘a sort of infant’, incapable of taking charge of their ownbodies, finances or lives.The data presented in this paper lend credence to the neosecularization thesiswhich argues that secularization does not mean the decline or evendisappearance of religion. Rather, it signifies the declining significance andinfluence of religious authority structures in contemporary western society. Thisoccurs in tandem with the ascendancy of self in the fashioning and constructionof individual and social life (Yamane, 1997; Yip, 2002). Internal and externalpluralism within the religious landscape in contemporary western society has ledto increasing diversity in religious expressions, practices and identities. Indeed,religious orientation, identity and practices have become increasingly internally-referential and reflexively-organized, prioritizing human subjectivity. There is aperceptible relocation of interpretive authority to the self, buttressed by broadhumanistic – often anti-authoritarian - values such as social justice, humanrights, personal responsibility, liberty and diversity (e.g. Repstad, 2003). This isparticularly true among religious people with dissident identities (Wilcox, 2002,2003; Yip 2002; 2003c).31This development in the religious landscape is of course reflective of thecontemporary western society as a whole. Processes such as de-traditionalizationand individualization have significantly undermined the basis of traditionalauthority, leading to the empowerment of the self. Life, therefore, has becomeincreasingly a strategic trajectory in the construction of social biography (e.g.Giddens and Pierson, 1998; Bauman, 2001).Indeed, in the case of non-heterosexual Christians and Muslims, queeringreligious texts becomes one of the strategies to construct ‘do-it-yourself’ socialbiographies to achieve identity coherence and continuity. Nevertheless, I mustreiterate the importance of appreciating the different levels of efforts betweenthese two religious groups due to the discrepancy in theological and socialcapital. I envisage that younger generations of non-heterosexual Muslims wouldlead the way for such progress. This is because empirical research on youngergenerations of British Muslims have shown that their identities, compared tothose of the older generations, are more contested and reflexive, as a result of abroader cultural repertoire that selectively incorporates their cultures of originand western values of personal freedom and liberty (e.g. Samad, 1998; Husainand O’Brien, 2001; Manji, 2003).Acknowledgments32Data on non-heterosexual Christians is drawn from a project funded byNottingham Trent University.

Some consider it pejorativebecause it labels people against the perceived norm of heterosexuality,thus reinforcing heteronormativity. They prefer ‘lesbian, gay, andbisexual’. This phrase itself is unsatisfactory, as others insist onprolonging it, in the name of inclusivity, by adding ‘transgendered’,‘queer’, and more recently, ‘intersex’. I decided to use ‘non-heterosexual’throughout the text (except where there is a need to specify) primarilybecause it embraces all the labels used by participants – ‘gay’, ‘lesbian’,‘bisexual’, ‘homosexual’ and ‘queer’ - to represent their dissident identity,in contrast to ‘heterosexual’.332 In the past decade, there has been a burgeoning corpus of sociological andpsychological research on non-heterosexual Christians. However, this isnot the case for non-heterosexual Muslims. The data on non-heterosexualMuslims presented in this paper are drawn from the very first piece ofsociological research on this sexual minority, although there have beenseveral publications by support groups, based on anecdotal evidence andpersonal testimonies (all cited in this paper).3 There is diversity in the ideological framework of the ‘ex-gay movement’.Some are tolerant of ‘homosexual orientation’ but not ‘homosexualpractice’, thus abstinence is imposed. Others adopt a more stringentapproach and attempt to ‘heal’ with their ‘stepping out of homosexuality’programme. In general, all groups emphasize the importance of spiritualintervention and discipline. Examples of such groups are: True FreedomTrust (in the UK), Exodus International and Living Water (both in the USA).4. Hower (2003) reports that while 60% of the lesbian and gay population inthe USA are affiliated to a religion, only 38% practise their faith publicly(e.g. participating in church activities).5 For instance, the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement has a membership ofmore than 3000, with local groups across the UK. There are also manyother non-heterosexual Christian groups organized by profession, gender,and denomination. In comparison, support groups for non-heterosexual34Muslims are a recent occurrence, the Al-Fatiha Foundation (in the USA) andAl-Fatiha UK were established in 1998 and 1999 respectively (Al-Fatiha UKchanged its name to Imaan in April 2004).ReferencesAlthaus-Reid, M.

    "abstract": "Religious authority figures often use religious texts as the primary basis for censuring homosexuality. In recent years, however, non-heterosexual Christians and Muslims have begun to contest the discursively produced boundary of sexual morality.Drawing upon two research projects on non-heterosexual Christians and Muslims, this article explores the three approaches embedded in this strategy.While acknowledging that homosexuality is indeed portrayed negatively in some parts of religious texts, the participants critique traditional hermeneutics by highlighting its inaccuracy and socio-cultural specificity, and arguing for a contextualized and culturally relevant interpretation. They also critique the credibility of institutional interpretive authority by highlighting its inadequacy and ideology, and relocating authentic interpretive authority to personal experience. Finally, they recast religious texts to construct resources for their spiritual nourishment.This strategy generally reflects the contemporary western religious landscape that prioritizes\n\nthe authority of the self over that of religious institution",
