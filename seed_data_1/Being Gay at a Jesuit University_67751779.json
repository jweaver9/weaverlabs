(2012) \"Being Gay at a Jesuit University,\" Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education: Vol. 41,Article 27.Available at: http://epublications.marquette.edu/conversations/vol41/iss1/2744 ConversationsIn June, 2009, with funding fromthe provost’s task force on “TheUniversity and the CatholicIntellectual Tradition” at BostonCollege which encouraged eachof its members to take on a salientproject relevant to our university and itsCatholic identity, we chose to investi-gate policies and structures that Jesuituniversities have established to wel-come and foster the growth, health andwelfare of our lesbian, gay, bisexual,transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) stu-dents, faculty and staff. This reportresulted from that funding.Around 2:30 AM on September 9,2007, a 19-year-old gay, male student atGeorgetown University was verballyassaulted and physically attacked bythree men on 36th Street near the cam-pus. The victim identified one of theattackers as being another Georgetownstudent, and that student was latercharged with simple assault onSeptember 27th in connection with theattack. The university did not alert theGeorgetown community until the arrestwas made. In response to this incident, agroup of students protested what theyconsidered the university’s failure to alertits community of a reported hate crime. This attack on a GU student andthe pro-active response from studentswere the major precipitating events thatled President John J. DeGioia to meetwith student leaders and discuss theneeds of LGBTQ students atGeorgetown in early October. Studentssuggested four major areas of improve-ment for the university, and as a result,the President called an open town halldiscussion on October 24, 2007, pro-posing “that our community worktogether on a more comprehensive ini-tiative to strengthen Georgetown’sapproach to addressing the needs ofLGBTQ students.” President DeGoia appointed twovice presidents to provide senior admin-istration leadership for this coordinatedeffort. They were in charge of develop-ing and staffing four working groupscovering: Reporting Incidents; Resources;Education and LGBTQ Issues, while alsoreporting all findings via reports to theprovost and the president. Members ofthe groups broadly represented theGeorgetown community, as students,staff and faculty volunteered their timetoward this LGBTQ campus-wide initia-tive. All groups were charged to com-plete their work in the fall 2007 term, sothat in the spring 2008, recommendationsfrom each group could be consideredand implemented. Within a year after the hate crime,Georgetown University established itsLGBTQ Resource Center staffed with afull-time director. It took only threemonths after President DeGioiaaddressed the Georgetown communityon October 24, 2007 for all three work-ing groups to generate reports with rec-ommendations that would help imple-ment the LGBTQ university initiative. For the remainder of this report wewill closely examine the LGBTQResource Center (which grew out of theWorking Group on Resources) and pos-sible lessons for other Jesuit universities.The Working Group on Resourceswas encouraged by President DeGioiato “evaluate the nature and level of sup-port for coordinating LGBTQ communi-ty resources.” The group initiated threeinterest groups, consisting of memberswho had been known in the past forbeing supportive of LGBTQ students,their issues and concerns, and for hav-ing a deep intellectual understanding ofthe Catholic tradition. Each group wasencouraged to be inclusive of all per-spectives and to participate transparent-ly with openness and honesty, as wellas to have group members representingfaculty, staff, undergraduate and gradu-ate students. The Internal Evaluation Groupfocused on reviewing and imple-menting the teaching of theCatholic Church, Georgetown’s being Gay at a Jesuit UniversityThe Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Resource Center at Georgetown University: A Case StudyBy S. Wade Taylor and Kevin J. Mahoney S. Wade Taylor and Kevin J. Mahoneyare in the Boston College GraduateSchool of Social Work. This essay is acondensation of a longer report.1Taylor and Mahoney: Being Gay at a Jesuit UniversityPublished by e-Publications@Marquette, 2012Conversations 45mission and identity as a Jesuitschool, the importance of access toequal education, the care of thewhole person (cura personalis),and the need to provide necessaryresources for all students, includingat-risk populations. Membersaddressed issues that pertainedspecifically to the internal climate ofthe university, including both nega-tive and positive reactions to creatinga LGBTQ Resource Center. They dis-cussed the history of LGBTQ issuesand concerns on campus, the needsof all students on campus regardingLGBTQ resources, and LGBTQ edu-cation and its implementation acrosscampus and with other student sup-port groups. The External Resources Groupinvestigated what and how otheruniversities had created resourcesspecific to LGBTQ students andtheir needs. Some of these schools(including Duke, Princeton,Syracuse and the University ofPennsylvania) were invited toattend a two-day symposium at GUto discuss the mission of their cen-ters, results to date, and the time-lines in which these results hadoccurred. In addition, one execu-tive administrator from GU visitedselected schools to identify in moredepth how these colleges met theneeds of LGBTQ students.The Allies/Friends Groupfocused on gathering informationon alumni attitudes. Alumni supportwas crucial for a successful project.Allies and friends and a number ofLGBTQ alumni responded positive-ly to providing not only their pro-fessional expertise on identifyingresources, but also their personalstories as students who onceattended Georgetown. Though notdirectly related, in theSpring/Summer 2008 the officialalumni supported GeorgetownMagazine (Spring/Summer, 2008)published an article entitled “Outon the Hilltop.” This article provid-ed personal stories about the livesof LGBTQ alumni and their livedexperiences while being students atthe university (GeorgetownMagazine, Spring/Summer, 2008).Also, a special reception for LGBTQalumni, attended by the Presidentand many members of Georgetown’sboard of trustees, was held at theannual alumni gathering.Each interest group reported their find-ings to the larger working group, andthe information helped the workinggroup to develop a proposal for creat-ing an LGBTQ Resource Center, and tohire a full-time director and a programcoordinator. The products of theirefforts included a description of thedirector’s position, a budget for staffingand managing the Center, and sugges-tions for necessary liaisons and connec-tions for the Center to be effective.From beginning to end, it took aboutthree months for the working group onLGBTQ resources and its interestsgroups to complete its work. In less than a year after the initialhate crime was reported by a GU stu-dent, the LGBTQ Resource Center wasin place. In August, 2008, it opened itsdoors with a full-time director, and inspring, 2009, a full-time program coordi-nator was added. It now has studentinterns who staff various programs andhelp provide leadership around campus.It is the first known LGBTQ resourcecenter in the nation at a Jesuit universi-ty that has a full-time director. Thedirector of the LGBTQ Resource Centerreports directly to the vice president ofstudent affairs. Determining the best location for theResource Center was very important.After a rigorous decision-making process,the group decided locating the center oncampus would provide an easily accessi-ble center for the entire Georgetowncommunity. It is a resource center for allpersons affiliated with the university,regardless of sexual orientation and gen-der expression. The Resource Center mission state-ment, its vision, and the values and state-ments of values and action are describedbelow and can also be read from theLGBTQ website at http://lgbtq.george-town.edu/about/mission.html.Interviewees identified four themeswhich describe the gestalt of how andwhy the center functions positivelywithin a Jesuit university:Georgetown University students participating in March for Community.2Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education, Vol. 41, Iss. 1 [2012], Art. 27http://epublications.marquette.edu/conversations/vol41/iss1/2746 ConversationsThe Care of the Person: TheCatholic Jesuit ideal of cura person-alis encourages us not only tostrive to care for the whole person,but also to help provide the meansand opportunities for that person tosucceed holistically. This care mustoccur within a free and respectfulenvironment where adequateresources are available equally forall persons. For students, staff andfaculty at a Jesuit school, theseresources are considered a necessi-ty to identify and preserve ourGod-given talents. Internal Partnership across theUniversity: The ongoing internalpartnerships across the universityare also a theme that continues thesuccess of the LGBTQ ResourceCenter. It was important for allissues and concerns from alldepartments and schools to beheard and synthesized, as well as tobe considered important feedbackfor consideration. This opennessand transparency lead to a strongerinternal partnership. This internalpartnership was further strength-ened by creating multiple LGBTQworking groups that included stu-dents, staff and faculty from differ-ent departments and schools acrossthe university. Active Involvement of Alumni:As a stakeholder group, alumniwere invited to participate throughthe entire process of creating theLGBTQ Resource Center. Prior to thehate crimes of the Fall 2007 term, asmall group of LGBTQ alumni hadbeen actively encouraging the uni-versity to develop a more inclusiveand safe environment for LGBTQstudents. The resource committeeinquired about alumni attitudes andconcerns from alumni who werehomosexual and heterosexual.These alumni were satisfied thattheir voices were finally being heardby executive administration. Relationship with CampusMinistry: Since the inception ofthe LGBTQ Resource Center, thedirector has been working closelywith campus ministry and chaplains(a total staff of 45-50 people). Forboth departments, it was importantfor students, staff and faculty,regardless of sexual orientation andgender-variant expression, to contin-ue developing an intellectual andmeaningful understanding of faithdevelopment. LGBTQ students, staffand faculty are also spiritual persons,and they require resources that willhelp them to continue their faithdevelopment across the lifespan. Theresources campus ministry and itschaplains provide have been salienteducation about faith developmentand the dignity of the person. Theyjoined in partnership to help createsafe places where people can pursuetheir sexual identities in relationshipto their own spiritual journey. Considerations for OtherJesuit UniversitiesEvery university has a different tradition,environment, culture and leadership.Given that the relationship betweenCatholicism and homosexuality has oftenbeen seen as problematic, this case studyfocused on the pioneering work atGeorgetown University, one of our sisterJesuit institutions. For the administratorsand faculty interviewed, responding to theneeds of LGBTQ students was seen as anopportunity, not as a threat. Moreover, itwas an opportunity for them to further theprinciple of cura personalis because of,not in spite of, their faith and beliefs. With great dedication and persist-ence, GU implemented a resource centerwhich now provides the entireGeorgetown community with diverseeducation, intellectual dialogues, andsocial support regarding LGBTQ per-sons, their families and friends. As withall diversity initiatives, the process ofimplementation usually results in lessonslearned, and developing a LGBTQResource Center at GU is no exception.Completing the case study provided thefollowing insights that may be consid-ered for any Jesuit institution interestedin conducting similar steps to provideadequate resources for LGBTQ students.A transparent and an inclusiveapproach to implementing an LGBTQinitiative may be the best policy.President DeGioia and his administrationdemonstrated this approach in the fol-lowing ways: Calling the town hall meet-ing and inviting students to provideinsight and potential leadership as theuniversity conceptualized the LGBTQ ini-tiative; presenting to the Board ofTrustees the need for an LGBTQResource Center and informing the lead-ership of the archdiocese of Washington,DC; and, inviting both internal and exter-nal evaluation groups, including alumni,to participate in creating the resourcecenter. These examples established aspirit of transparency and inclusivity thatultimately helped to create and imple-ment a resource center expeditiously. An LGBTQ Resource Center shouldwork closely with other educational andintellectual avenues on campus. Whenhired, the director immediately invitedfaculty and staff in the chaplain’s office tojoin an intellectual conversation on faithdevelopment within all persons atGeorgetown, including LGBTQ students.A relationship with campus ministry isimperative for a center to provideresources particularly in regards to intel-lectual faith development. LGBTQ stu-dents deserve a safe space to be able toaddress similar questions associated withfaith development as any other studentregardless of sexual orientation or genderexpression. At this time, the chaplain’soffice has an explicit goal to assist theLGBTQ Resource Center in its mission. The LGBTQ Resource Center andits leadership should consider whetheror not it wants to include in its missiona political agenda. It was important forGU that their center focused on provid-ing education and resources for thecommunity while not using the center3Taylor and Mahoney: Being Gay at a Jesuit UniversityPublished by e-Publications@Marquette, 2012Conversations 47as a political platform. Forexample, some student groupsmay want to use the LGBTQResource Center as a platformto push a particular perspec-tive about sexuality that mayor may not be in concordancewith the Catholic Church. Atthe university, some studentswanted the resource center toendorse a “Sex Positive” week,which was hosted by GUPride, United Feminists andthe Georgetown SolidarityCommittee. The week advo-cated particular perspectivesabout sexuality, and theresource center chose not toendorse this agenda. It did,however, continue its missionby providing resources andeducation, when necessary,for those students, faculty andstaff associated with or affect-ed by “Sex Positive” week. The implementation ofany LGBTQ initiative at a Jesuitinstitution may be most effec-tive if it is supported by theexecutive administration of theinstitution, starting with thepresident. One of the majorstrengths that helped GU tocreate and implement aLGBTQ Resource Center wasthe support and leadershipcoming from the top. Theadministrators modeled forother staff and students work-ing with them the Jesuit princi-ple of cura personalis and aspirit of love and equality. Itwas this leadership which alsorequired a transparency andinclusivity throughout theentire process. These insights and les-sons learned may be utilizedstrategically in any Jesuit-affili-ated university that desires toimplement a LGBTQ initiativeor resource center on campus.The administrators and facultyof GU shared their ideas andinsights openly, and haveassured us they are interestedin sharing this experience withfellow Jesuit institutions. Theyacknowledge that the creationof the resource center is nota panacea; homophobia andhetero-sexism cannot beconquered overnight. Still,they unanimously agreedthat the results were worththe effort. We would like tothank specifically thosemembers of the Georgetowncommunity who agreedwithout reservation to talkwith us about the LGBTQResource Center, its imple-mentation, and what theybelieve contributes to its suc-cess. Without their help wewould not have been able tocompile this report, and weare grateful for their time,energy and willingness toengage in further conversa-tion about implementingLGBTQ initiatives at otherJesuit universities. ■Addition to the Report“In Dreams BeginResponsibility”By Sivagami SubbaramanThe line comes from an old Irish Catholic play serves astouchstone for how we envision the work at the Center.It has been a dream for many, over many decades to havespace, value, permission, and belonging on the hilltop.No dreams, no vision forthis work is possible with-out both an individualand a collective sense ofresponsibility—to create acommunity that speaks toall of who we are — acommunity that givesexpression to the fullrange of our humanityand dignity, which is afundamental principle ofthe Ignatian tradition.Central to this work is ourability to grasp and maketangible the central para-dox: to hold in placeequally the sense of animpossible dream, and an intractable responsibility, inorder to do this work. The Center opened its doors in the Fall of 2008, andin our three years here, we have become both integraland integrated into the campus community. We partici-pate in the full range of pre-orientation, orientation, andleadership programs at the start of the year, and closewith Lavender Graduation, and between offer ComingOut Week, Gender Liberation Week, Pride Week, andspecial speaker series. We also collaborate with manyacademic units to deepen the conversation on campus.Lavender Graduation honors LGBTQ and allied stu-dents and their contributions to the community; and ithas grown from 30 students to 70 students with morethan 200 attending the event. It has become a centralcommunity celebration to start off our Commencementweek, and a way to rejoice in all of who we are. Wehave worked very hard to find and re-engage ourLGBTQ alumns, and we now routinely participate inHomecoming, Reunion, and John Carroll alumni week-ends. For many of our alums who have felt dis-engagedor not welcome, this has been a huge sea change, andfeel they can now truly call the Hilltop their home.
