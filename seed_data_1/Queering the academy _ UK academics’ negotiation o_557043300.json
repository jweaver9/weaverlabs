Any quotation from the thesis or use of any of the information contained in it must acknowledge this thesis as the source of the quotation or information. i  Abstract Whilst ‘queering’ theory has been accepted in higher education institutions, queering the organization is not, and more research is needed on lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, queer, intersex and asexual (LGBTQIA) and heterosexual academics’ experiences working in Higher Education  (Rumens, 2016a). In this manner, research omits to examine how LGBTQIA academics are marginalized and the ways in which sexuality and gender are inextricably “linked within a dominant heterosexual masculinity” in which academics are judged (Fisher, 2007:512). Research drawing on queer theory is thus needed in order to expose the oppressive systems conditioned and (re)produced by ‘compulsory heterosexuality’, also termed heteronormativity, within academic institutions (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014). Although queer theory recognizes multiple and intersecting identities, it often tends to “reinforce simple dichotomies between heterosexuality and everything ‘queer’” (Gamson and Moon, 2004:52) hence neglects and subsumes differences in terms of marginalized sexualities (Angelides, 2006) and how non-normative sexualities can render gender as a ‘stable’ category unstable (Butler, 1999).  Given the lack of research ‘queering’ the academy, the aim of the study was to understand how academics navigate working life in workplaces where discourses around ‘heterosexuality’ are the implicit norm. Using snowball sampling to facilitate recruitment of participants, this study is based on 30 qualitative semi-structured interviews with academics identifying across the sexuality and gender spectrum working in UK higher education. All of the transcribed interviews were analysed for emerging discourses relating to LGBTQIA academics’ workplace experience and heteronormativity. Additionally, to explore how sexualities negotiate the heterosexual/homosexual binary and the possibility to deconstruct essentialism, Willig’s (2013) Foucauldian discourse analysis was utilised.  Rather than challenging normative ideals of gender and sexuality, the study found academia, as an heteronormative institution, (re)produces knowledge, practices and norms that marshals academics ‘with a sexuality’ into a ‘queer friendly closet’ which restricts opportunities to ‘bring sexuality to work’. This was found to present particular challenges for self-identified bisexual academics that further have to negotiate the heterosexual/homosexual dichotomy and its underpinning norms rendering non-binary sexualities ‘invisible’. From a queer theoretical perspective, this poses problems for the opportunity to deconstruct essentialism and ‘queer’ the academy away from binary and normative thinking.  ii  Acknowledgements  I am forever grateful to my wonderful supervisors, Professor Kate Sang and Dr. James Richard for guiding me and always supporting me.

lacking relevance to the study of paid work (Williams and Giuffre, 2011). Yet, the extant literature has found that social inequality is prevalent in the construction industry (Wright, 2013; Chan, 2013; Rumens, 2013; Wright, 2015), probation service (Beckett, 2012), police department (Colvin, 2015; Galvin-White and O’Neal, 2016) and the firefighter service (Ward and Winstanley, 2006). Moreover, there has been a growing interest in studies addressing the concerns of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, queer, intersex and asexual (LGBTQIA1) educators in Higher Education  (see Tierney, 1997; Pinar, 1998; Frank, 2006; Renn, 2010; LaSala et al, 2008; Ozturk and Rumens, 2014; Rumens, 2016a). Although diversity has been positioned within the higher education as “a marketable signifier”, academic staff and students are not encouraged to realise difference as, particularly sexual orientation, is often thought to be a lifestyle choice or belong to the private sphere (Morrish and O’Mara, 2011:974). Additionally, one in ten academics in the UK have been threatened or intimidated at work due to their sexual orientation or gender identity (UCU, 2016). There have, however, been attempts at identifying reliable estimates of the LGBTQIA population in order to promote equality and challenge discrimination on the grounds of gender identity and sexual orientation (Aspinall, 2009). However, there are limitations associated with quantitative research seeking to ‘quantify’ subjects’ experiences, particularly when sexual and gendered identity elude the binary-categories that are available to them in surveys or questionnaires (Misgav, 2016).   Drawing on post-structuralist theoretical insights, positivist and quantifiable methods and underpinnings have been criticised for silencing marginalized voices and experiences (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005) forcing respondents to identify with particular (normative) sexual variables hence fixing their identities (Browne and Nash, 2010). As qualitative research concerning sexuality and gender has been ‘hidden’ in hegemonic quantitative research, the qualitative ‘turn’ has allowed, ideally, researchers to move away from rigid, a priori categories of gender and sexuality (Misgav, 2016). However, queer possibilities of sexualities and genders are often rendered invisible within the heterosexual/homosexual binary often permeated within management and education research (Rumens, 2017). Rather than marginalizing experiences and identities not easily subsumed under (hetero)normative categorization and practices, queer theory celebrates transgression from the                                            1 LGBTQIA will be used throughout the thesis to include a broader spectrum than LGBT, unless drawing on extant literature that specifies otherwise.  2  ‘norm’ and questions universal assumptions underpinning the ‘normative’ (Martin, 1994). It is the regime of sexuality, the knowledge constructing what is sexual, that queer theory seeks to challenge (Seidman, 1994). The current research thus aimed to answer Ozturk and Rumen’s (2014) call for research that questions normative knowledge in higher education while disrupting the hetero-homosexual binary to enable queer identities and voices.   1.2 Purpose of the current study The purpose of the study was twofold. Firstly, the study sought to bring gender into the study of sexualities to explore how sexuality might trouble gender as a stable identity. Drawing on post-structuralist theoretical insights, the current study follows Judith Butler’s (1999) genealogical inquiry of gender and sexual ‘performativity’. Butler (1999) argues that there is no ontological status of the subject, however, subjects are constituted by the performative enactments of norms making certain genders and sexualities ‘true’ within heteronormative frames. This allows for an exploration of the interconnectedness and disruptive displays of sexuality and gender, for example, the ways in which “gender is sexed and sexuality is gendered” in ways that are not regarded as normative (Valocchi, 2005:753). Recognizing the overlaps and interrelatedness of queer and feminist projects (Jagose, 2009), the current research sought to disrupt the (hetero)norms embedded in the academy. The interrelatedness is important, as Fotaki (2011:42) argues; “while the subject of sexuality in academy is conspicuous by its absence, issues of gendered control and their material consequence on sexual bodies pervade its institutions”.  Secondly, the current study sought to disrupt normative knowledge in the academy drawing on queer theoretical sensibilities. UK higher education has seen tremendous changes to the functioning of its business with the introduction of new managerialist approaches to monitor productivity, performance and efficiency, which is being promoted as “objective and gender neutral” practices (Steinbórsdóttir et al, 2019:105). However, the increased managerial focus on output control has resulted in less obvious forms of discrimination, which have been argued to present particular disadvantages for academics that are not heterosexual, white, ‘able’-bodied and ‘male’ (Teelken and Deem, 2013). Samek and Donofrio (2013:30) thus suggests that academic bodies are controlled within interlocking systems of power/privilege that further disciplines academics to adhere to frameworks that reflect sexist, homophobic and heteronormative beliefs for the purpose of “professional development”.   3  Although queer theory was introduced to disrupt academic heteronormativity, or more specifically to ‘queer academia itself’ (Pullen et al, 2016:3), academic institutions tend to be unaffected by the disruptive powers associated with queer theory (Renn, 2010). Management and organizational research drawing on queer theory to ‘queer’ and rupture the normativity of academia is therefore an under-research area, although a small number of exceptions exist (see Tierney, 1997; Pinar, 1998; Frank, 2006; Renn, 2010; LaSala et al, 2008; Ozturk and Rumens, 2014; Rumens, 2016a). However, the limited empirical research contributing to queering the academy has been concerned with gay men (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014; Frank, 2006; Tierney, 1997) and lesbian women (Pringle, 2008). Research aiming at deconstructing the normalcy of institutions, drawing on queer theory has been criticised for omitting to discuss the implications of “normative heterosexuality on heterosexuality” (Jackson, 2006:105) by investigating “the naturalising narratives of compulsory heterosexuality” (Butler, 1999:146). However, ‘inclusivity’ to ‘gay friendly’ organizations is found to be restricted to what counts as ‘normative’ (Williams and Giuffre, 2011). Williams and Giuffre (2011:557) are therefore concerned; “where does this leave queer people, those who refuse the hetero /homo binary, reject conventional family values, engage in non-normative sexual practices, and pursue queer activism?”. As such, the current research seeks to address these gaps by incorporating queer theory to challenge and disrupt the normative functioning of the academy following a qualitative research design drawing on post-structuralist epistemologies and ontology examining how academics with non-normative genders and sexualities navigate academia.   1.3 Research aim, questions and objectives The aim of this thesis was to understand how academics navigate working life in a workplace where discourses around ‘heterosexuality’ are the implicit norm. Informing this research, underpinned by a queer theoretical lens, the following research questions were devised:  ▪ What discursive arrangements constrain and enable the development of LGBTQIA and heterosexual identities in academia? ▪ What happens to LGBTQIA and heterosexual people whose sexual and gender performance violate normative genders and sexual discourses in academia? ▪ How do bisexuals, and non-binary sexualities understand their subjects in relation to the hetero/homo binary? In what way does this binary enable and constrain gendered and sexual subjectivities to be performatively enacted?  4  Further, the current research sought to answer the following objectives derived from the extant literature discussed in Chapters Two to Four:  1) To understand the role sexuality plays in academics’ working lives 2) To uncover the ways in which academics negotiate discourses of heteronormativity and how heteronormativity constructs sexualities deemed ‘normal’ 3) To investigate the contextual factors contributing to workplace (in)equality encountered by LGBTQIA and heterosexual academics in UK Higher Education 4) To advance and apply queer theory’s performativity theory to understand how non-binary sexualities (bisexual, pan, queer) ‘trouble’ gender and sexuality as stable categories.   1.4 Outline of the thesis In the first major chapter of this thesis, changes in attitudes towards sexuality and gender identity are discussed followed by an introduction to the relevant legal frameworks constructed to support LGBTQIA people in society and workplaces. This chapter further addresses the issues concerning sexuality and gender identity in the academy to provide a rationale for selecting UK academia as the research context. Subsequently, Chapter Three presents the extant literature conducted on LGBTQIA employees’ workplace experience. The aim of Chapter Three is to identify and discuss a selection of research gaps based on current management literature concerning sexuality and gender. The chapter discusses key themes such as the organisational culture and the discursive practices restricting LGBTQIA employees from inclusion to the workplace including hegemonic masculinity, heteronormativity and discriminatory behaviour such as homophobia, biphobia and transphobia.   Chapter Four introduces the theoretical framework that guided the current research, namely queer theory, in order to challenge normative knowledge concerning sexuality and gender, which was found to underpin much of the extant literature. This chapter starts by presenting alternative theoretical frameworks to understand sexuality in order to demonstrate how queer theory offer a useful way of disrupting practices constructed as ‘normal’ by troubling the discursive practices restricting the formation of gendered and sexual subjects and subjectivities at work (Butler, 1999; de Souza et al, 2016). In order to ‘queer’ “previously closed analytical categories” associated with traditional social science research on sexuality and gender (Popoviciu et al, 2006:399), the research 5  methodology is designed to avoid essentialising participants’ sexualities and gender identities in the research process. The literature discussed in Chapters Two to Four forms the basis for the objectives underpinning the current research, outline in Section 1.3. As such, Chapter Five aims to design a research methodology following a post-structuralist paradigm that rejects epistemological absolutes (Popoviciu et al, 2006) while rejecting an ontological certainty of a ‘core’ or ‘true’ self (Green, 2010; Butler, 1999) to capture the complexities of fluid and ‘performative’ identities (Fotopoulou, 2012).    The current methodological framework of the thesis leads to Chapters Six and Seven where the findings are analysed and presented. Following a Foucauldian discourse analysis to analyse qualitative interviews with UK academics identifying across the gender and sexuality spectrum, Chapter Six starts with discussing the role sexuality plays in academics’ working lives and the contextual practices inhibiting academia from being ‘queered’. Chapter Seven further draws on the experiences of non-binary sexualities, as 11 out of the 30 participants self-identified as ‘bisexual’, ‘pansexual’ and ‘queer’ academics. Next, Chapter Eight is structured to facilitate a discussion linking the research findings to key issues discussed in Chapters Two to Four. This approach acts as a means to help answer research objectives set out in the methodology chapter. Finally, Chapter Nine brings the thesis together with concluding remarks whereby the contributions are outlined in the discussions of the objectives as well as the research limitations, implications and areas for future research.     6  Chapter 2 Assimilation to the heterosexual British society  2.1 Introduction  The aim of this chapter is to uncover the drivers for LGBTQIA equality in the workplace and society. This will be achieved through an examination of the ‘grey literature’, which encourages a discussion of the attitudes towards sexuality and gender identity. The chapter starts with a discussion of the changes in attitudes towards LGBTQIA people and the relevant anti-discrimination laws that have encapsulated the rights of LGBTQIA employees within legislation. Expanding on the legislative framework, employers have started to recognize the benefits of a diverse workforce and are thus emphasizing that successful management of diversity can contribute significant business advantages, which is discussed in Section 2.4. Despite these changes, however, in social and business attitudes towards LGBTQIA equality and inclusion, it is evident that hate crimes, bullying and discrimination are still reflected in LGBTQIA people’s workplace experience, which is investigated in Section 2.5. In particular, academia has been found to be the sector with the highest levels of workplace bullying, which is discussed in Section 2.6.   2.2 Changing landscape in attitudes British society has seen tremendous changes in attitudes and culture to support LGBTQIA inclusion and equality because of increased visibility, activist groups and legislation as well as changes in acceptable gender roles. Attitudes towards homosexuality have increased by 10 per cent from 2012 where 76 per cent of Britons believed that homosexuality should be accepted within society to 86 per cent in 2019 (Poushter and Kent, 2020). Additionally, the attitudes towards trans*2 identities are changing, as public poll statistics by SKY revealed that 48 per cent of Britons believe that gender reassignment is not morally wrong (Hirsch, 2015).   However, there are to date no exact statistics on the LGB population in the UK where the figures range from 0.3 per cent to 10 per cent (Aspinall, 2009). While a 2017 survey by the Office for National Statistics states that approximately 2 per cent of the adults in the UK identify themselves as lesbian, gay or bisexual (Office for National Statistics, 2019), a 2015 study by YouGov found that 4 per cent identified themselves as completely homosexual and 19 per cent as bisexual (Keating, 2015). Similarly, no data has been collected that includes a question where trans* people can choose to identify themselves (Fernandez et al, 2015), however, it is suggested that around                                            2 Trans* people are individuals that are born with a body that do not align with their gender identity (Yavorsky and Sayer, 2013). As such, the term trans* is used to take into account the variety of terms used to describe a person`s gender identity and is not limited to identify as transgender, transsexual etc. Transmen and transwomen are also used with the purpose of explaining the workplace experience of individuals that has transitioned from woman or man (Collins et al, 2015).   7  650,000 people in the UK “experience some degree of gender nonconformity” (Gender Identity Research and Education Society, 2016:unpaginated). Unite The Union (2011) therefore propose that employers should assume that approximately one per cent of their employees and service users are experiencing some degree of gender variance. However, reliable estimates on the LGBT population are stressed as an important contributor to promote equality and challenge discrimination on the grounds of gender identity and sexual orientation (Aspinall, 2009).   Findings from The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles reveal that the proportion of people who have had same-sex experiences are higher than the estimated LGB population in the UK (Spiegelhalter, 2015). This is particularly evident among women in the age group 16 to 44, as statistics on same-sex experiences have increased from 4 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2000 and to 16 per cent in 2010 (Spiegelhalter, 2015). While heterosexuality is still manifested as the ‘norm’ within society, British society is experiencing significant changes in attitudes that challenge the dominance of heterosexuality. A study by YouGov from 2015 reveals that 49 per cent of people between 16 and 24 years of age do not identify themselves as 100 per cent heterosexual but rather somewhere on the spectrum (Dahlgreen and Shakespeare, 2015).   However, opinions regarding gender identity are divided, as revealed by a study for The Fawcett Society, which found that 56 per cent of Britons believe that gender is binary where a person can only choose to identify as either woman or man, while 44 per cent believes that gender can be a range of identities (Henry, 2016). Similar to the attitudes regarding sexual fluidity, the younger generations are less likely to view gender as dichotomous, with 68 per cent of people between the ages of 18 to 24 identifying gender is fluid (Henry, 2016). However, homophobia, biphobia and transphobia is still manifested in the 21st century society and workplaces, as a study by YouGov for Stonewall found that one in five people admit to making anti-LGBT comments whereas 60 per cent of those surveyed confessed that they did not intervene when they overheard derogatory comments being made about LGBT people (McCormick, 2015). The next section will thus discuss the relevant laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination.   2.3 Anti-discrimination law Gender reassignment and sexual orientation discrimination matters are included, alongside other protected characteristics such as age, disability, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, sex, pregnancy and maternity, at Section 4 of the Equality Act 2010 (EA). Under Section 8  12 of the Act, sexual orientation is defined as orientation towards (a) persons of the same sex, (b) orientation towards persons of the opposite sex and (c) orientation towards persons of the same and opposite sex. However, gender reassignment is defined under Section 7(1) to protect anyone who is:   “proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the person’s sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex”.   Additionally, a recent employment tribunal ruled that non-binary and gender fluid people will now be protected under Section 7(1) of the Equality Act (Wareham, 2020). However, a consequence of mainstreaming aspects of sexuality and gender identity is the assumption that all LGB and trans* people are the same, which represents new challenges to understanding and equality (Ahmad and Bhugra, 2010). This has been a flaw of the EA 2010 as it, until recently, promotes and maintains essentialist views about sexualities and trans* identities by not protecting non-binary and gender fluid people thus homogenising the protected characteristics according to ‘normative’ strands.   2.4 The business- and social justice case for equality and diversity Despite the legislative framework discussed above, inequality among LGBTQIA employees still exists. As such, the corporate world has adapted a business case towards diversity, which moves away from the legal case for equality towards more individualized business case arguments. It require employers, in compliance with their legal duties, to engage employees towards understanding the importance of an inclusive organizational culture while delivering services and products that meet the diverse needs and preferences of their customers and clients (CIPD, 2015). It is, for example, estimated that minority groups will transcend the traditional mainstreaming majority in London by 2020 (Smith and Barratt, 2015). As such, businesses have recognized that they need to reflect the people in the market in which they operate in order to fully understand and embrace the shift in society (Smith and Barratt, 2015). Larger employers have become increasingly aware of the benefits of being ‘gay-friendly’ as they get the most from their workforce while at the same time it enables businesses to retain and build stronger relationships with LGBTQIA customers. This has been recognized as an important opportunity among employers as the purchasing power of LGBT people, or the ‘pink pound’, accounts for £6 billion per annum, which represent an addressable market and is an important asset for the UK economy (Beveridge, 2015). 9  Similarly, Stonewall (2015) argues that businesses can benefit from brand loyalty and access to untapped LGBT markets, which is estimated to be worth £70 billion a year by showing support for the LGBT community.   However, and most importantly, it is suggested that LGBTQIA friendly policies results in less discrimination and consequently increased openness about being LGBTQIA hence decreased levels of stress and anxiety among LGBTQIA employees (Krejcova, 2015). While merely 61 per cent of Fortune 500 companies had anti-discrimination policies based on sexual orientation in place and only 3 per cent banned discrimination on the grounds of gender-identity in 2002, these figures rose dramatically by 2014 where 93 per cent of Fortune 500 companies had introduced corporate non-discrimination policies and 61 per cent included gender-identity (Petru, 2014). Out Now’s 2015 report ‘show me the business case’ for LGBT diversity, suggests that the UK economy could save $1 billion annually by implementing better inclusion and diversity policies for LGBT employees (Johnson and Cooper, 2015). For example, a report on engineers shows that a contribution to GDP of £11.2 billion is lost per year as a consequence of bullying and pressures on LGBT engineers in the workplace (Shelbrooke and McBride, 2015). Following the business case, it was proposed that productivity could be increased by 30 per cent as a result of a more cohesive and happy workplace where workers can be openly queer (Shelbrooke and McBride, 2015).   As discussed above, the business case for diversity has gained increased interest, however, the rationale behind this is often associated with promoting diversity for economic purposes. As such the social justice case towards diversity argues for equality to be an integral part of the organisation without any economic benefits by promoting an idea of the organisation as “a socially responsible institution” (Tomlinson and Schwabenland, 2010:105). Thus, external and internal pressures from LGBTQIA employees, shifts in society and union activists have pushed employers towards ‘ending’ discriminatory practices against LGBTQIA workers through supportive policies such as non-discrimination policies and domestic partner benefits (Badgett et al, 2013).   2.5 Continuing high levels of LGBT inequality Even though there is a widespread belief that as LGBTQIA individuals have gained legal equality they are now generally accepted within society due to the change in people’s attitudes, it is not reflected in the experiences of many LGBT people (TUC, 2014). Figures from the police reveal that the number of homophobic hate crimes has increased from 4267 incidents in 2012/2013 10  (Chakraborti and Hardy, 2015) to 14500 in 2019 (Dearden, 2019). Additionally, hate crimes towards trans* people rose with 37 percent from 2018 to 2019 with 2333 incidents (Dearden, 2019). However, these figures are likely to be underestimated as some victims of transphobia may be targeted 50 times per year but only 30 per cent of such crimes are reported (Chakraborti and Hardy, 2015: Sommers, 2016). Additionally, statistics have found that 7 in 10 LGB people do not report hate crimes to anyone (HM Government, 2011).   It is further suggested to be a linkage between bullying because of sexuality and mental health issues (TUC, 2014). A study by Pace, an LGBT mental health charity, reported that 48 per cent of trans* people under the age of 26 have attempted to commit suicide (Ross, 2015). Similarly, a survey conducted by researchers from Cambridge found 12 per cent of lesbian women and 19 per cent of bisexual women experience mental health problems, compared to six per cent of heterosexual women (Merrill, 2014). This is suggested to be a result of bisexual women’s difficulties disclosing their sexual identity due to the underdeveloped changes in societal attitudes towards bisexuality because of its complexity, and are thus more likely to have negative attitudes towards themselves (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2015). It is further found that gay men earn five per cent less than heterosexual employees in the UK (The Economist, 2016) while bisexual men are four times more likely to experience poverty compared to heterosexual men (Uhrig, 2013). At the same time, research suggests that lesbians tend to earn more than heterosexual women and tend to be higher educated than straight women while less likely to have children, however, this wage premium was more evident in the private sector (The Economist, 2016).  As such, statistics indicate that workplace inequalities persists, which contradicts the assumption of changing social attitudes (Purton, 2015). However, it has become more difficult to detect homophobic and transphobic events as it is suggested that harassment has become more subtle (TUC, 2014).  For example, stereotyping is found to be used to harass and bully LGBT individuals in the workplace where colleagues and managers treat people based on their own stereotyped version of what a lesbian (butch) or gay (camp) man should be like, behaviour which is more difficult to ‘prove’ (Hoel et al, 2014; TUC, 2014). A comprehensive study by Hoel et al (2014) found that LGB people were more than twice as likely to experience workplace bullying compared to heterosexual employees. The study found bisexuals were the group that most frequently reported experiencing bullying at work where 19.2 per cent had experienced bullying occasionally or 11  regularly compared to 6.2 per cent of heterosexuals, 16.9 per cent of lesbians and 13.7 of gay men (Hoel et al, 2014). Gender were also an important factor when LGB employees had made complaints about discrimination, as men’s cases were more likely to be investigated (62 per cent) than complaints from women (19 per cent) (Hoel et al, 2014).   A study from 2015 on the attitudes towards sexuality shows that homophobia operates within the British building industry (Ramchurn, 2015). Homophobia was particularly evident among gay construction workers, as 85 per cent had heard homophobic remarks in the workplace over the last 12 months compared to 59 per cent in architecture, 61 per cent in engineering and 63 per cent in property (Ramchurn, 2015). However, it was less likely that heterosexual construction workers noticed homophobic remarks, as less than half of heterosexual respondents had heard homophobic comments or the word ‘gay’ used in a degrading manner in the workplace (Ramchurn, 2015). New forms of discrimination and the neglect of robust statistical evidence of the LGBTQIA population is argued to prevent meaningful comparison of the inequalities faced by LGBTQIA people in relation to heterosexual people (Price, 2011). Additionally, NASUWT, the largest teachers’ union in the UK, found that 86 per cent of teachers felt that the government is not doing enough to communicate the importance of LGBT equality to schools and staff (NASUWT, 2014).   The lack of knowledge regarding equalities legislation has been identified as a factor that makes bullying in the workplace more likely (Hoel et al, 2014).  In a survey investigating the awareness of the Equality Act across the public, private and the voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector, it was found that a third of the respondents had not heard about the Act (Perren et al, 2012). This was particularly evident in the private sector (71 per cent) with more awareness in the public sector (51 per cent) and VCSE sector (51 per cent) (Perren et al, 2012). This is peculiar considering increasing attempts among private and voluntary sector employers to introduce ‘good practice’ to show commitment to equality and diversity (Colgan and Wright, 2011). However, it is in recent times found that there are higher levels of bullying in the public sector than in the private sector (Hoel et al, 2014). Whereas the national average of bullying across various sectors in the UK are ranging between 10 to 20 per cent, academia has been found to be the sector with highest levels of workplace bullying with statistics ranging from 18 to 42 per cent (Farley and Sprigg, 2014). This is peculiar considering that academia is supposed to be a sector that has a liberal belief system (Sang et al, 2015).  12  2.6 (In)Equality in Academia  2.6.1 The changing context of academia UK higher education currently employ 439,955 people of who 217,065 are academic staff (HESA, 2020a). The higher education sector has seen tremendous changes to the running of the business including marketization, new managerialist practices and governance (Teelken and Deem, 2013). Firstly, the reduced public funding has forced universities to move from elite education towards a mass education system (Deem, 2003). Figures revealed that the number of students enrolled to UK universities increased by 2 per cent in 2018/2019 (HESA, 2020b) with a 9 per cent increase in non-EU students (UCAS, 2019). Second, the sector has experienced a move from a liberal ideal towards an ‘economic ideology’ where universities have to become increasingly efficient enterprises with regards to wealth creation (Dearlove, 1997). This new scenario has restricted academics’ autonomy in relation to undertaking research that is favoured by the government (Dearlove, 1997).   Third, academic labour has been made cheaper (Baldry and Barnes, 2012), as for example, a report by UCU, the University and College Union, found that more than 50 per cent of academics are employed on a precarious contract that assumes a “hire-and-fire culture of insecure working” within higher education (Grove, 2016a:unpaginated). This has resulted in the higher education sector becoming one of the most casualized sectors in the UK next to the hospitality industry (Fazackerely, 2013). Trade unions have also lost significant power (Klikauer, 2015), which has further reduced the position of academics in relation to their employers (Dearlove, 1997). Additionally, reduced government funding and increased intake of students has resulted in a rise in student/staff ratios (Baldry and Barnes, 2012) whereas academics are required to ‘do more with less’ (Deem, 2003:253) that further has intensified academics working days (Sang et al, 2015). The intensification of academic working lives is supported by a report by UCU (2013) on stress in higher education, which stated 75 per cent of academics found their work “very stressful”.  Fourth, the ‘marketisation’ and ‘entrepreneurialisation’ of UK higher education has resulted in ensuring “university activities are balanced through the price mechanism (Brown, 2015:5). Statistics from HESA (2019) shows that British universities’ total income in 2017/2018 was £38,2 million, of which tuition fees accounted for £18,9 million. This ‘commodity discourse’ has changed the student/staff relationship as students are thought to be treated as customers whereby research and teaching are thought of as business to be sustained through recovery of costs, also regarded as the ‘academic labour process’ (Baldry and Barnes, 2012:229). However, marketisation 13  of universities is thought to be a necessity in order to attract students and, consequently, to compete in international recruitment markets (Adams, 2020). The higher education sector has significant growth potential as international student education is one of UK’s largest service exports (Morris et al, 2016). The 21st century university culture has, however, been argued to have become “a culture of rack ‘em, pack ‘em and stack ‘em” of students in order to drive funding, where academics have reported that the quality of teaching has been reduced due to overcrowded lecture theatres (Paton, 2014:unpaginated; Sandiford, 2020).   Despite all of the changes above, it is still generally advocated that British academics should experience autonomy of work, security of tenure, equal salary structure and values in work allocation, and teaching and research interdependence (Harley, 2003). Prior to the 1980s, however, this might have been the ideal of a collegial university culture that embraced and promoted autonomy, security through tenure, participatory democracy and equality among academics without hierarchy (Dearlove, 1997). However, due to the significant changes in the higher education sector, universities have shifted from “secure and autonomous to insecure and invisible” (Sang et al, 2015:237). In addition to these cuts and the push of universities towards the marketplace, a new form of discourse, namely ‘new managerialism’ have dominated the sector (Skelton, 1998; Peterson, 2014).  2.6.2 Inequality in Academia as a response to ‘New Managerialism’ The introduction of ‘new managerialist’ procedures, also widely referred to as new public management, is according to Davies (2003:91) the “most significant shift in the discursive construction of professional practice and professional responsibility that any one of us will experience”. Deriving from the Thatcher government, new managerialism was introduced as a means to manage, control and surveil individuals (Davies, 2003). Rather than focusing on the educational missions of universities, new managerialist reforms made universities increasingly business oriented through the incorporation of Human Resource practices that required changes both in organizational structures and the day-to-day management of universities (McTavish and Miller, 2009).   As autonomous workers with high task variation are difficult to control, the aforementioned changes was implemented with the aim of standardizing tasks to make academic work increasingly easy to monitor (Parker and Jary, 1995; Feather, 2011). The implementation of management 14  techniques that originally derived from the private sector to monitor research and teaching output including Teaching Quality, Research Excellence Framework (REF) and National Student Survey (NSS) has become both naturalized and normalized within universities (Skelton, 1998; Clarke and Knights, 2015). REF, for example, is a framework that measures the productivity and quality of research conducted by academics across disciplines and subject areas (Ellis et al, 2014).   The introduction of REF has been found to affect the quality of teaching as it has become a second priority whereby career progression relies on publications, which implies publishing in 4* journals (Clarke and Knights, 2015). Parker and Jary (1995) thus argue that the modern higher education sector has transitioned into ‘McUniversities’ whereby everything becomes standardized. Research are monitored through the number of publications and number of citations whilst teaching is about processing an increased number of students in the most cost-effective manner. As such, activities that cannot be measured, or do not result in increased capital are argued to be less attractive (Parker and Jary, 1995). Skelton (1998) thus argues that ideologies concerning value for money and efficiency have replaced notions concerning equality and opportunity. Consequently, Teelken and Deem (2013:527) argue “the individualistic and competition-based work culture in research institutions and the prevailing one-dimensional view of academic quality is not very appealing for certain groups of employees”. As such, the ‘new managerialist’ agenda seeks to encourage three Es’, “economy, efficiency and effectiveness”, with limited room for a fourth E, namely equality (Morley, 1997:234). Within this realm of control, social problems in higher education are thought to be viewed as a “technical problem that can be managed” (Klikauer, 2015:1111).  2.6.3 Academia as an endemically gentleman’s club Even though it is implied and thought that new managerialist styles of management are gender-neutral (Deem, 2003), it has created an ‘ideal type’ that tend to be conflated with traditional masculine values (Carvalho and Machado, 2010). The findings from an ethnographic study of the ‘boys club’ embedded in British universities by Fisher and Kinsey (2014) illustrate the ways in which ‘male’ homosocial bonding is a powerful feature of British universities that facilitate career progression and privilege. They found men were more comfortable working with other men and ‘publicly sponsored’ each other for promotions and job openings. Additionally, when women were appointed a job or promotion, it was assumed there was something wrong with the process, which had to do with reasons other than competence for the job (Fisher and Kinsey, 2014). Women have not only been excluded from the informal socialisation between men within academia, it is also 15  found that women’s career progression is affected by the ‘gender-neutral’ discourse of meritocracy of academia (Harley, 2003). This meritocracy is argued to both “explain and legitimate inequality” (Johansson and Sliwa, 2014:22). This is because, as Fotaki and Harding (2012:167) explains, women entering the academy have to position themselves as “masculine speaking subjects” in order to gain legitimacy as academics.   Although women account for 46 per cent of academic staff, only 27 per cent hold professorship in UK universities (HESA, 2020a). Additionally, there is an underrepresentation of ethnic minority women professors in UK universities as a report found that only 25 Black women hold professorship (Osho et al, 2019). The managerialist discourse underpinning performance management, meritocratic nature of promotion and excellence, and ‘quasi-market’ perspective on both teaching and research are informed by masculine expectations and norms that is vital for academic advancement (Deem, 2003; Aleman, 2014). For example, it has been found that equal distribution of awards and recognition for publications are highly gendered with men more likely to attract scientific prizes than women (Johansson and Sliwa, 2014). However, Athena SWAN (Scientific Women’s Association Network) was introduced to provide grants and funding to Higher Education institutions to advance the representation of women academics in science, technology, engineering, medicine and mathematics (STEMM). Athena SWAN is now used across departments in Higher Education to bring about gender equality (Advance-HE, 2021).   Furthermore, research conducted by men is also thought to be more valued than administrative tasks and teaching (Deem, 2003; Steinpórsdóttir et al, 2019). This further hinges on what constitutes as ‘excellence’ against which academics are judged (Van den Brink and Benschop, 2011). The construction of ‘excellence’ in academia with regards to peer reviews, funding applications, journal rankings etc. are masculine structures that cause inequality (Van den Brink and Benschop, 2011). This is because academia is structured around ‘male’ perceptions of ‘success’ in relation to the expectation of an uninterrupted career path, being considered as active in research and active participation in REF (Knights and Richards, 2003). However, although it is widely believed that the REF is based purely on merit, research has shown that 52 per cent of ‘male’ academics were considered research active compared to 32 per cent of ‘female’ academics (McTavish and Miller, 2009). Additionally, analysis by Times Higher Education found there is a wide pay-gap between women and men academics whereby women are paid a median hourly wage of 15.1 per cent lower than male academics (UCU, 2019).  16   The new managerialist agenda also masks difference as found in a study by Johansson and Sliwa (2014) where the merit-based system concealed difference amongst non-UK staff and the ways in which the masculine, white ‘man’ norm still underpins the ‘lecturer’ role despite the internationalization of UK higher education. The intersection of being a woman, feminist and black academic has also been found to cause marginalization for ethnic minority women in academia, but also allowed them to challenge the “status quo” of universities (Sang, 2015). The managerial agenda has further been found to (re)produce heteronormativity through the model of ‘nuclear family’ whereby the inherited gender-specific roles from the private are transmitted to the workplace (Skelton, 1998). As such, Knights and Richards (2003) argue men and masculinity are inextricably linked in academia whereby women and femininity become marginalized.   In this manner, it is argued that the masculinized nature of academia has silenced the ‘female body’ where ‘female’ academics are perceived or forced to perceive themselves to not fit in. Fotaki (2013:16), for example, found that women in business schools had to downplay femininity, or difference from men, who remain the “invisible and unmarked norm” of academia. Knowledge also remains significantly gendered, where women’s knowledge is both devalued and diminished within academia (Fisher, 2007). Additionally, Fisher and Kinsey (2014:53) found that the entrepreneurial discourse within the ‘new managerialist’ agenda of universities have become a top priority, which is usually articulated through a heterosexual act of speech including “penetrating markets” or “getting into bed with suppliers”. Similarly, Phipps and Young’s (2015) research on ‘lad cultures’ in UK Higher Education highlights how sexism and violence has become accepted in today’s neoliberal university. For example, this study found female students being rated for their ‘sex appeal’, being victims of sexual assault, forced to perform cis-femininity and penalised for challenging sexist behaviour as normalized behaviours in the academy (Phipps and Young, 2015). However, sexuality issues remains neglected from examinations on academic inequality (Renn, 2010). Research thus neglects to examine how LGBTQIA academics are marginalized and the ways in which sexuality and gender are inextricably “linked within a dominant heterosexual masculinity” in which academics are judged (Fisher, 2007:512).   2.6.4 Sexuality and gender identity as part of the (in)equality agenda Dearlove (1997:71) argued that “we need to know more about working in higher education, and we need to work on and in more ways of knowing”. This is particularly the case with regards to 17  sexuality, although a number of empirical research on LGBTQIA educators’ workplace experiences exist (see Tierney, 1997; Pinar, 1998; Frank, 2006; Renn, 2010; LaSala et al, 2008; Ozturk and Rumens, 2014; Rumens, 2016a). The changing context of higher education including meritocratic rankings and increased focus on global mobility associated with the internationalisation of higher education to the marketplace can be thought to pose significant challenges for LGBTQIA academics. Further, Renn (2010) argues that a vital step towards breaking the silence of sexuality is to incorporate a student survey that addresses LGBT issues within, what is generally thought to be conservative universities. However, a study by UCU (2016) found that students are generally reluctant to state their sexual orientation for monitoring purposes. Additionally, bisexual students were ten times more likely to not want to disclose their sexuality (UCU, 2016). This could also be the case for academics as previous research has relied on categorical definitions of bisexual, gay, lesbian and heterosexual academics’ identity (Renn, 2010).   Although diversity has been positioned within the higher education as “a marketable signifier”, academic staff and students are not encouraged to realise difference as, particularly sexual orientation, is often thought to be a lifestyle choice or belong to the private sphere (Morrish and O’Mara, 2011:974). In this manner, Skelton (1998:120) argues that if universities are thought to be responsive of “what sells in the marketplace, then having gay, lesbian and bisexual societies to the heterosexual majority is unlikely to be viewed as strategic”. Additionally, the lack of knowledge regarding equalities legislation, particularly on the basis of sexual orientation, has been identified as a factor that makes bullying in the workplace more likely (Hoel et al, 2014). This issue was found to be particularly relevant in academia as a study conducted by UCU (2016) found that 78 per cent of university staff did not have sufficient knowledge regarding who to contact if they encountered or experienced bullying due to sexual orientation or gender identity at work.    The increased managerial focus on output control has resulted in less obvious forms of discrimination (Teelken and Deem, 2013). Subtle discriminatory practices might present particular disadvantages for academics that are not heterosexual, white, ‘able’-bodied and ‘male’ (Teelken and Deem, 2013). Additionally, meeting the metrics presented in the REF and the trend towards more casualized contracts has been suggested to disadvantage groups that generally have been excluded from the academy (Abramson and Stokes, 2015). However, statistics on the breakdown of gender, sexual orientation, (dis)ability or ethnic minority staff on zero-contract or hourly paid contracts are non-existing (Abramson and Stokes, 2015).  18   Another issue concerning sexual orientation and academic career opportunities is the internationalisation or globalization of universities to countries, such as Dubai. Although research on the globalization of organizations and how global mobility affect and restrict non-heterosexual employees’ career opportunities exists (Mizzi, 2014; Gedro et al, 2013; McPhail et al, 2016), there is limited knowledge about how globalization of higher education marginalizes LGBTQIA academics (Renn, 2010). This is vital in order to understand how LGBTQIA academics negotiate their identities in academia and how sexuality affects international career opportunities in highly heteronormative contexts, for example in university branches where homosexuality is illegal. The lack of recognition of non-heterosexual relationships at international campuses and its potential to hinder career progression may call into question an employer’s commitment to sexual equality   The internationalization and the necessity of global mobility amongst academics is not only related to international branches or campuses, but also conferences. Fenby-Hulse (2016) wrote a blogpost for Times Higher Education reflecting on his experience as a gay academic and how his sexuality is holding him back in academia. He argued sexuality remained silent by not being able to submit an abstract to attend conferences in countries where sexuality is still illegal. He further argued funding bodies are not open to everyone as it restricts research on particular topics or in certain regions. The difficulties associated with conducting research regarding sexuality issues could also be a consequence of managerialism’s one-dimensional agenda that facilitate “thinking inside the box” (Klikauer, 2015:1115). Thus, (re)constituting sexuality research as credible research has been found to be an important step towards challenging heteronormative practices within academia, although difficulties persist in publishing in highly-ranked business journals (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014).  Any research topics “outside the box”, such as gender, have been argued to have a negative impact on women’s career ambitions as a consequence of its ‘soft’ association and the challenging philosophy that make it uncomfortable for many men (Fisher, 2007). This has also been found to be the case with sexuality studies whereby ‘radical’ theories such as queer theory have been thought to be uncomfortable for heterosexual academics which have been found to restrict career trajectories for academics undertaking this area of research (LaSala et al, 2008). For example, a self-identifying gay academic in Skelton’s (1998) research was not allowed to participate in the 19  Research Assessment Exercise3 as his study on gay sexualities did not meet the requirements of ‘substantiality’, although the Director of Research stressed that this was not due to the nature of his research. This illustrates the ways in which hegemonic masculine cultures create ‘appropriate’ knowledge that are articulated within universities both with regards to (hetero)sexuality and (normative)gender (Fotaki, 2013), which is also reflected in terms of what constitutes ‘excellent’ research. This also demonstrates the negative effects of the marketisation of higher education as it is based on what is thought to sell, which is reduced to what is ‘normative’ (Skelton, 1998).   However, neglecting to incorporate sexuality and gender identity issues to the curriculum and the lack of support towards sexuality research, is detrimental given universities are important transmitters of knowledge both within and outside of the university. Although the Stonewall top 100 employers list found that there were “more ‘gay-friendly’ universities than ever” (Grove, 2016b:unpaginated), there is still evidence of high levels of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic abuse of higher education staff and students (UCU, 2016). For example, findings have revealed that one in ten academic staff have been threatened or intimidated due to their gender identity or sexual orientation (UCU, 2016). It is thus vital for change, given that a recent study have found academics are “disproportionately likely to be gay” (Matthews, 2016:unpaginated). However, Tierney’s (1997) influential book ‘Academic Outlaws’ highlights the experiences of closeted gay and lesbian educators in the US, which found participants consciously created a separation between academic and private selves in order to avoid heterosexism and homophobia in the academy.  Additionally, it has been found that universities are concealing or hiding traces of homophobic complaints made by students so portraying a false picture of inclusivity by regarding homophobia as innocent “banter” rather than discrimination (Sheriff, 2014).   As Renn (2010) put it, whilst queering theory has been regarded as acceptable by higher education institutions, queering the organization is not as the study of LGBTQIA staff has been nearly absent in higher education institutions. Thus Tierney (1997:175) argue “if we assume that the structures of knowledge in part have defined normalized relations that have excluded homosexuals, then we need to break those structures rather than merely reinvent them for ourselves”. Luhmann (1998), for example, questions the traditional ways of knowing in the academy and argues that knowledgeable subjects are victims of normalization processes. She thus call for queer pedagogy to call into question what is known and its associated knowledge production. Similarly, Pinar                                            3 Now referred to as Research Excellence Framework (REF). 20  (1998:2) argued “it is past time to correct the repression of queers in the curriculum, especially in history and literature and the arts. It is past time to think out loud what queer pedagogy and queer curriculum might be. There is the matter of the canon, for starts”. Rumens (2016a) thus proposes a research agenda to challenge heteronormativity within business schools, particularly the ways in which business schools (re)produce heteronormativity. This is vital considering that the academic gender division within business schools remains highly ‘male’ dominated (HESA, 2020a).   2.7 Conclusions The purpose of this chapter was to uncover the drivers for LGBTQIA equality to the workplace and society in order to understand why research on LGBTQIA employees’ experiences is pivotal. Firstly, through an examination of the advancement in legislation and the ‘grey literature’ documenting changes in social attitudes towards sexuality and gender identity, this chapter illustrate that hostility towards LGBTQIA people still persist in the 21st century society. Although anti-discrimination rules has encapsulated the rights of LGBT employees within the legislation, it is evident that sexuality and gender identity is promoted as essentialistic traits in the current Equality Act 2010. Within this framework, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans* and heterosexuals’ identities are homogenised according to (hetero)normative strands (Ahmad and Bhugra, 2010), which poses new challenges to understanding and equality.  Whereas the UK private sector has been reported to be experiencing higher levels of discrimination of LGBTQIA employees in the past (Colgan and Wright, 2011), evidence suggests that higher levels of workplace bullying are more evident in the public sector (Hoel et al, 2014). This is particularly apparent in higher education sector where statistics on workplace bullying is twice as high as the national average (Farley and Sprigg, 2014). However, little is known about LGBTQIA and heterosexual academics’ workplace experience. As such, the next chapter will discuss the limited studies that exist on LGBTQIA employees’ workplace experience to build on the arguments from this chapter, stressing sexuality must be considered relevant to the study of paid work.    21  Chapter 3 Heteronormativity: an axiomatic privilege of normalcy  3.1 Introduction The previous chapter uncovered the ways to which heterosexuality has been constructed as the only ‘normal’ and ‘natural’ sexuality, which has been well promoted in society as a whole requiring LGBTQIA people to assimilate into heterosexual forms of identities (Richardson, 2004). This chapter, however, expands by discussing the impact unquestioned heterosexual normalcy has on lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, queer, intersex and asexual (LGBTQIA) individuals’ workplace experience. As such, this chapter starts with an examination of the extant literature on organizational culture followed by a discussion on how assumptions underpinning organizational cultures restricts open discussion about non-heterosexual peoples experience resulting in silencing of sexuality. Further, the complexity of breaking the silence by ‘coming out’, barriers relating to embodiment and negotiating gender and sexuality in workplace interactions will be discussed in Sections 3.4 to 3.6. However, the causes to these barriers can be explained by discursive practices such as heteronormativity, hegemonic masculinity and overt hostility often expressed through homophobia, transphobia and biphobia that persist in organizational cultures, which is discussed in Section 3.7. Finally, a conclusion will be provided in Section 3.8 to sum up the main points and a discussion of future directions.  3.2 Organizational culture The power held by heterosexual, white, non-disabled men are often taken for granted hence neglected in the discussion of organizational cultures (Wilson, 2000), which this section seeks to unravel. The concept of culture originates from anthropology, although influenced by sociologists, and has been subject to extensive analysis within organizational literature (Wilson, 2000; Liff and Cameron, 1997). Liff and Cameron (1997) distinguishes between two approaches within the field of organizational culture: culture as something an organization ‘has’, and something it ‘is’. The former regards culture as a necessity for survival where managers believe they are able to change the culture if they find the cause, hence viewed as a primarily diagnostic approach (Wilson, 2000; Liff and Cameron, 1997). This approach is criticised for its reliance on the “structural-functional” paradigm that makes culture, within anthropology, often descriptive rather than exploratory (Meek, 1988). On the other hand, the second approach views culture as an outcome of shared meanings and symbols derived from interactions, which is termed ‘symbolism’ (Meek, 1988; Wilson, 2000). Although these conceptualizations of organizational culture are gendered, research on organizational culture neglects gender and theorises organizations as if it was gender neutral 22  (Hearn and Collinson, 1998; Mills, 2002). Organizations are gendered; it is not possible to separate gender from the organization, as gender is built into every aspects of the organization (Kuokkanen and Seeck, 2013). As Acker (1990:146) states:  “To say that an organization, or any other analytic unit, is gendered means that advantage and disadvantage, exploitation and control, action and emotion, meaning and identity, are patterned through and in terms of a distinction between male and female, masculine and feminine.”   Organizational cultures thus ‘do’ gender by positioning ‘male’ and ‘female’ in a complementary relation that subordinates difference and creates segregated occupations (West and Zimmerman, 1987; Gherardi, 1996). However, gendered organizational cultures are also sexualised due to the interrelatedness of gender and sexuality, as gender cannot exist without the concept of homosexuality or heterosexuality (Broadbridge and Hearn, 2008; Sedgwick, 1990). As such, Acker (2009) argues that sexuality plays an integral role in the construction of workplace inequalities and in the research on gendered organizational cultures. It is thus noted that the functionalist approach to organizational culture is not applicable to the research on the construction and reproduction of gender and sexuality, as it cannot be treated as a variable due to its fluidity (Hearn and Collinson, 1998).  The ‘symbolic’ approach is regarded as a suitable framework for understanding organizational culture in relation to gender and sexuality, which is viewed as co-constructed and unstable (Liff and Cameron, 1997; Butler, 2004). Three interacting levels of organizational cultures are integral to this framework including basic assumptions, ideologies or values, and artefacts (Martin and Siehl, 1983). An underlying assumption that contribute to workplace inequality is that organizations are often assumed to be “men’s cultures” (Hearn and Collinson, 1998). This underlying assumption implies that the hegemony creates gender norms that have an impact on the experiences of people within and outside that group (Lusher and Robins, 2009). Hearn and Collinson (1998) theorises the less obvious behaviours of the organizational culture as ‘subtexts’, which includes non-heterosexual groups, who are subject to social silencing. A metaphor relating to the taken-for-grantedness of men’s dominance in organizations is thus that women and non-heterosexuals can be viewed as “travellers in a male world” or “travellers in a heterosexual world” (Gheradi, 1996:191). Even though these “travellers” deviate from the organizing practices because 23  they contravene the assumptions of heterosexuality and are, therefore, trapped in pre-existing narratives concerning gender relations, they can use these narratives to reinvent and affirm their identity through negotiation with co-workers (Gheradi, 1996). Accordingly, heterosexist, racist and homophobic conversations are discourses incorporated within everyday interactions in organizations without being noticed or responded to; assumptions that constitute a culture (Kitzinger, 2005). Organizational cultures thus restrict open discussions about non-heterosexual identities and their lives hence promoting silencing practices, which makes it difficult for LGBTQIA people to come out.   3.3 Silencing practices The existing research suggests that issues affecting LGBTQIA employees are not discussed in the workplace nor are LGBTQIA employees able to talk about their lives (Gray, 2013). Paradoxically, such lack of discussion and absence of voice can be seen as ‘silence’ (Woolley, 2012). As such, Foucault (1979:27) highlights there are multiple forms of silence– “the things one declines to say, or is forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between different speakers”, which constitute discourse.  Further, the development of the discourse relies on what is being said and what remains unsaid, where the latter is of significance in both illustrating power relations and acting as a mechanism of resistance or coping (Reingardè, 2010). This is evident in a study by Priola et al (2014) that investigated silencing processes and practices concerning LGBT diversity and inclusion in four Italian social cooperatives through interviews and focus groups with supervisors, executive directors, senior managers and LGBT employees. Three themes emerged from the findings; silence, silenced practices and silenced voices. Firstly, silence was justified as a means of ‘respect’ to non-heterosexuals whereas heterosexual co-workers argued that LGBT employees ‘chose’ to silence themselves (Priola et al, 2014). Silencing practices were particularly evident in formal settings as none of the organizations discussed LGBT issues at work, which works to maintain the status quo in organizations (Woolley, 2012). In addition, a manager felt obliged to ‘protect’ other employees from homosexuality once people came out of the closet by not talking about it. This illustrate the power relations of silence whereas the ‘speakable’ (heterosexuality) is differentiated from the ‘unspeakable’ (homosexuality) (Butler, 1997). It was further evident that the LGBT employees’ voices became silenced due to the heterosexist and heterocentric organizational culture (Priola et al, 2014).   24  Furthermore, Acker (1990:151) argues that sexuality is controlled through organizational silence which risks excluding the sexual body as a “living whole”. This was evident in a qualitative study by Beckett (2012) with self-identifying straight and lesbian officers in one UK probation service, which examined how issues relating to sexuality are both excluded and silenced. The research demonstrates how silence, metaphorically, can be referred to as a “negative space” (Ward and Winstanley, 2003) as illustrated in a quotation by a straight respondent: “it’s like race – none of us like to think about race, it’s scary, but at least we do talk about it. We don’t even talk about sexuality” (Beckett, 2012:758). While the quotation illustrates the silencing of sexuality, it also shows the ways in which assumptions about heterosexuality are rendered unquestioned in organizations (Clair et al, 2005). The statement further suggests that the unsaid or unspoken, namely sexuality, remains forbidden to talk about (Ward and Winstanley, 2003). This was further articulated by interviewees in terms of the fear of being identified as ‘sexual’ whereas both lesbian and straight respondents utilised and negotiated resistance strategies including self-presentation  according to heterosexual norms through dress, talking excessively about family or avoiding the topic, and always being ‘professional’ in workplace interactions (Beckett, 2012).   As such, although lesbian respondents were ‘out’, being ‘out’ implied being ‘in the closet’ in terms of being intelligible and visible (Woolley, 2012) by separating the sexual identity from the body (Beckett, 2012). Silence can also be maintained at an organizational level through symbols such as uniforms, which serve the function of masking differences between heterosexuals and non-heterosexuals, restrict possibilities to come out, while making it increasingly difficult for LGBTQIA employees to bring their identities to work (Willis, 2011). For example, Ward and Winstanley’s (2006) research in one UK firefighter service found that the uniform acted as both a medium of silencing non-heterosexual identities as well as resistance when a gay firefighter wore the uniform at Gay Pride.     3.4 Coming out/disclosure Coming out refers to the process of disclosing a non-heterosexual identity to another person, as people are often assumed to be heterosexual until ‘proven’ or told otherwise (Adams, 2010). Coming out of the ‘closet’ or disclosing a gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer or trans* identity is regarded as a vital event in the development of an integrated identity (McLean, 2007). The ‘closet’ is a metaphor that symbols the socially constructed divide between heterosexual and homosexual identities (Willis, 2011). As such, the ‘closet’ is used to illustrate how sexuality is rendered 25  invisible until a person discloses a non-heterosexual identity to another person hence ‘coming out’ of the closet (Adams, 2010). However, disclosing a homosexual identity has been regarded as a precarious approach to visibility, as coming out poses a political challenge to the discursive practices that compel non-heterosexual association and desires to remain in the ‘closet’ (Gray, 2013). In this manner, it is argued that LGBTQIA individuals face a ‘double bind’ in the sense that while identifying as homosexual is increasingly becoming more accepted; sexuality is still regarded as a private concern (Bowring and Brewis, 2009).   Coming out is argued to be a process (re)producing inequality as disclosure reinforces the privilege of heterosexuals in the way in which heterosexuals do not have to come out as ‘straight’ (Collinson and Hearn, 1994). As such, a person who is disclosing a non-heterosexual identity is rejecting to ‘pass’ as straight whereas a stigma is argued to become attached to their identity (Stambolis-Ruhstorfer and Saguy, 2014; Goffman, 1963). Similar to how a non-visible disabled person moves from a ‘discreditable’ identity to a ‘discredited’ identity by disclosing an invisible disability, a homosexual person has to repeatedly confirm the ‘discredited’ identity as non-heterosexual in discourse and action (Goffman, 1963). Following speech act theory (Austin, 1975), disclosure is understood here as a ‘performative’ act, where coming out is not constituted through a single event; it is rather a reiterative practice that “produces the effects that it names” (Butler, 1993:240). This will be discussed in more depth in Section 4.5.3.   Furthermore, coming out is often assumed to be necessary as heterosexuality is taken-for-granted in workplaces where a person is perceived to be straight until ‘proven’ otherwise (Gusmano, 2008). However, deciding whether or not to disclose depends on several factors including the receptivity of co-workers, customers or clients and the management, its perceived consequences in relation to career progression and daily activities, and the costs of concealment (Bowring and Brewis, 2009). This is illustrated in a UK based study by McDermott (2006), which found that the participants who did not disclose their sexuality at work were calculating the risks of disclosure in terms of ‘future happenings’ including the fear of being ridiculed, antagonism, isolation, harassment and shame. As such, concealment can be seen as a paradox as a person might be fully integrated within the workplace while an important facet of their identity is ignored (Ward and Winstanley, 2005). This can negatively impact an individuals’ self-esteem while affecting the productivity at work as the person is devoting significant amount of energy on maintaining coping strategies to ‘pass’ as heterosexual that include hiding certain aspects of self (Ward and Winstanley, 2005).  26   Similarly, some trans* people may decide to live their lives as “stealth”, which includes non-disclosure of their trans* background, as disclosure is perceived to be impossible due to risks such as termination and fear of becoming victims of violence (Collins et al, 2015). However, the risk of involuntary ‘outing’ and the lack of control over self-disclosure and identity presentation may compel people to self-disclose (Heintz, 2012). As such, positive aspects of disclosure include personal empowerment (Benozzo et al, 2015), perceived equal benefits (Lewis, 2009), increased personal wellbeing and health (Colvin, 2015) and reduced work-related stress (Bowen and Blackmon, 2003). It is also found that ‘out’ lesbians and gay men experiences lower levels of work-family conflict than their ‘closeted’ counterparts (Ozbilgin et al, 2011). The process of coming out is, however, restricted by embodiment, which is presented and interpreted in interpersonal relationships at work, and discussed in the following section.   3.5 Embodiment While the previous section illustrates the linguistic performance of ‘coming out’, the body is not fully understood through the performative act of speaking; the body is an instrument of the performative utterance (Butler, 1997:11). Further, Connell and Messerschmidt (2005) note that a person is not free to choose gender identification, as the possibilities to do so are restricted by embodiment. Embodiment has been defined as the “process by which the object-body is actively experienced, produced, sustained, and/or transformed as a subject-body” (Hutson, 2010:218). In other words, embodiment is a term used to destabilize the body as a static object as the ‘body we are’ is expressed differently in various social and cultural contexts (Hindmarsh and Pilnick, 2007). Gendered embodiment has thus been theorised as a set of bodily techniques that recognizes a person “doing gender” and is ‘done’ by men and women through routines and interactions in social situations (West and Zimmerman, 1987). As heterosexuality and gender can be viewed as inextricably linked, LGBTQIA individuals are required to conform to heterosexual forms of masculinity and femininity in order to be read as ‘real’ women and men (Yavorsky and Sayer, 2013). As such, Butler (1999) argues that gender is ‘performative’ in the sense that gender is always a ‘doing’ in accordance with the ‘heterosexual matrix’. The ‘heterosexual matrix’ assumes that gender and sex are conflated, which maintains and upholds the woman/feminine and man/masculine dichotomy (Butler, 1999), which is discussed in-depth in Section 4.5.   27  While it is argued that LGBTQIA individuals embody gender and sexuality, white heterosexual men are privileged, as they remain invisible with an ‘unmarked’ body, which is associated with disembodied normalcy (Simpson and Lewis, 2005). For example, a study by Benozzo et al (2015) shows how respondents came out as ‘different’ or ‘normal’ gay men. Coming out as ‘normal’ implied being like a ‘straight man’ in relation to masculinity whereas the gay identity is not regarded as ‘normal’ when embodied in the form of ‘drag’, ‘queen’ or ‘camp’, which is associated with ‘femininity’. This illustrates the hierarchy between gay masculinities and femininities, where gay men can construct themselves as ‘normal men’ by defining the embodiment of their gay identity in relation to the feminine form (Schippers, 2007). As such, LGBTQIA people have to embody ‘difference’ from the white ‘male’ norm that renders them ‘marked’ even though the embodiment of certain expressions of sexuality are more acceptable than others (Simpson and Lewis, 2005). Additionally, a recent study by Priola et al (2018) found that ‘inclusion’ hinges on LGBT people who do not “flaunt” their sexuality at work, which means conforming to heteronorms, restricting opportunities to construct queer subjectivities at work.    To be read as professional means conforming to heterosexual norms, which implies that non-heterosexual people have to leave their sexuality at home in terms of dress to suit the idea of professionalism (Humphrey, 1999). This was evident in a qualitative interview study by Rumens and Kerfoot (2009) with gay men working in ‘gay-friendly’ organizations, where it was found that ‘camp’ embodiment was not associated with professionalism or the ‘professional body’. As such, the findings revealed that the body was constructed as ‘professional’ when the respondents adapted to masculine standards, which was conveyed by dress, body structure, and appearance to ‘pass’ as straight, but also to differentiate themselves from straight co-workers (Rumens and Kerfoot, 2009). This illustrates how non-heterosexual individuals are expected to be ‘playing the game’ by adapting to masculine norms by using their bodies to maintain and achieve credibility as professionals (Haynes, 2012).   Furthermore, the assumption that lesbian is synonymous with ‘butch’ identity, which is associated with androgyny and masculinity (Eves, 2004), has resulted in stereotyping butch gender presentation as the ‘real’ and ‘authentic’ embodiment of lesbians (Huxley et al, 2014). Paradoxically, ‘butch’ lesbians are often perceived to deviate from the socially constructed and accepted norm of women as feminine and men as masculine and are thus targets of workplace discrimination (Drydakis, 2015). For example, Woodruffe-Burton and Bairstow (2013) utilised an 28  online ethnographical enquiry to investigate the identity formation of ‘butch’ lesbians based on the findings from a discussion thread entitled “my interview dilemma” where members discussed appropriate gender presentation for interviews. The respondents stressed a perception that ‘butch’ embodiment would negatively impact their chances for getting a job, and as such, expressed a need to dress according to the ‘heterosexual matrix’ (Butler, 1999) in relation to appropriate ‘feminine’ appearance, dress and style in order to be regarded as a suitable candidate for a job. This is supported by the findings derived from Drydakis’ (2015) study, which found that gay men and lesbian women who stated affiliation with ‘LGBT society’ in their CVs were less likely to be invited to job interviews for positions where particular feminine or masculine personality traits are highlighted.   Further, Acker (1990) have noted that while men’s bodies remains unchallenged and stripped from sexuality and gender, it is the ‘female’ body that introduces both sexuality and gender to the workplace. This was evident in a qualitative interview study by Wright (2013) with heterosexual and lesbian women working in the construction industry where lesbian workers downplayed difference from men by embodying a ‘masculine bodily display’ of self. They used their bodies to adapt to stereotypically ‘male’ norms through masculine dress and style in order to avoid objectification by heterosexual ‘male’ co-workers. However, Wright (2015) found that ‘butch’ lesbians that deviate from appropriate gender roles are targets of sexual comments and objectification (Wright, 2015). Objectification of lesbians may be exercised by heterosexual men based on the fantasy of lesbians as the ‘feminine’ object of masculine desire derived from pornography (Schippers, 2007). This builds on Acker’s (1990) theory of ‘Gendered Organizations’ in the ways in which women’s bodies are ‘ruled out of order’ in the construction industry while men’s bodies are not.   While appearance, in terms of dress and cosmetics, has been argued to contribute to how transwomen ‘pass’ as women, it also explains how some trans* people embody womanhood (Schrock et al, 2005). Yavorsky and Sayer (2013), therefore, argue that transwomen are read as men by default until they show cues of womanhood (breasts, long hair etc.) and as such have to engage in more bodywork than transmen. This was found to cause implications for a transwoman working as a prison worker in a study by Ozturk and Tatli (2015) who had started to grow breasts prior to considering full gender reassignment surgery and was not allowed to use the men’s nor women’s changing facilities at work by the manager. As such, the prison worker had to consult 29  with equal opportunities commission and raised this event as a grievance. In this manner, it is argued that the contradiction between a trans* person’s inner perception of self and the external appearance may cause distress that may result in reluctance to disclose (Brown et al, 2012).   However, trans* people have the opportunity to disrupt the sex and/or gender category, which opens the possibility for undoing or redoing of gender (Muhr et al, 2015). A study by Schilt and Connell (2007) with 28 transmen and transwomen, explored how they negotiated their identities through same-gender and cross-gender workplace interactions post transitioning. The study found that transwomen felt they had to downplay stereotypically masculine styles of interaction and rather ‘do’ femininity in order to maintain friendly relationships with ‘female’ co-workers as they were rejected from the powerful ‘male’ homosocial networks after transitioning (West and Zimmerman, 1987). Similarly, transmen were expected to ‘do’ gender in an ‘appropriately’ masculine way, such as engaging in sexual banter and do the ‘heavy lifting’ once they had transitioned. Even though the transmen and transwomen attempted to create alternative masculinities and femininities post transitioning, ‘cisgender’ workers placed them in a gender binary system, which in this case restricted the opportunity for undoing gender (Schilt and Connell, 2007).  3.6 Interpersonal relationships It is suggested that a person’s gender must both be presented and interpreted according to appropriate heterosexual practices in social interactions, which poses a challenge to LGBTQIA individuals (Yavorsky and Sayer, 2013). In this manner, Coston and Kimmel (2012) notes that minority groups, such as gay men, may find ways to oppress and dominate women and other minorities in interactions in order to reinforce their status as ‘real men’. This was evident in a UK study by Chan (2013) where gay and bisexual men in construction workplaces expressed misogynistic comments about women and disabled people in order to construct self-worth and gain acceptance of their work. This illustrates how subordinated masculinities within a hegemonic system focus on elements of privilege hence create their own dominant standard (Lane-Steele, 2011). It was also found that interactions inside and outside the workplace challenged the heteronormative idea of ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ as gay and bisexual male respondents engaged in sexual affairs with heterosexuals. This demonstrates the fluidity of sexuality whereas the dichotomous idea of sexual identity is deconstructed (Ng, 2013). As such, the findings challenge the hegemonic assumption of heterosexual subordination of homosexual men as 30  alternative masculinities derived through social interactions, which made non-heterosexuals ‘visible’ (Schippers, 2007).   However, gay men are often excluded from participation in homosocial relationships, or “bromances”, which maintain heteronormative hierarchies as it remains highly heterosexual in order to avoid being misperceived as gay (Hammarén and Johansson, 2014). However, friendships are vital for LGBT support and may facilitate LGBT individuals’ experience of ‘coming out’ (Rumens, 2010). A study by Rumens (2012) with men identifying as gay or bisexual, examined the development of workplace friendships between gay and bisexual men and heterosexual women in UK workplaces. The research illustrated the complexities of developing cross-gender friendship, particularly for bisexual men, as they could ‘pass’ as heterosexual, which meant building a seemingly ‘heterosexual’ friendship, or disclose their sexuality and having to ‘explain’ themselves to their heterosexual ‘female’ friends (Rumens, 2012). For example, a friendship between a bisexual man and heterosexual woman was articulated as replicating a “straight” couple dynamic by co-workers, hence adhering to heterosexist assumptions of romance as a ‘normal’ outcome of cross-sex friendships (Rumens, 2012).  On the other hand, Mishali (2014) argues that sisterhood and erotic bonding between women at work is obscured by organizational cultures which promotes compulsory heterosexuality. This was evident in a UK study by Wright (2015) who explored the creation of workplace friendships through 38 interviews with women in trades and construction industry, 15 of who self-identified as lesbian. It was found that sexuality posed barriers for the development of friendships between lesbian and heterosexual women, where some lesbians found it necessary to distance themselves form the ‘ordinary’ women by ‘mobilizing masculinities’ (Wright, 2015). Additionally, some women felt pressured to not be involved in interactions with other women due to the fear of negative reactions from male colleagues (Wright, 2015). Similar findings have been found in law enforcement environments, where Galvin-White and O’Neal’s (2016) study revealed that lesbian participants distanced themselves from the ‘lesbian exclusive club’ as they did not want to be associated with ‘lesbianism’.  3.7 Discursive practices Three discursive practices have been identified through reviewing existing literature that restrict LGBTQIA employees from full participation in the workplace, meaning not all employees are able 31  to bring their identities to work. These are heteronormativity, hegemonic masculinity and hostility towards LGBTQIA people that is often expressed through homophobia, transphobia and biphobia, which are assumptions embedded within the organizational culture.  3.7.1 Hetero- and cisnormativity Heteronormativity refers to “the elemental form of human association, as the very model of inter-gender relations, as the indivisible basis of all community, and as the means of reproduction without which society wouldn’t exist” (Warner, 1993:xxi). As such, heteronormativity aims to pervade specific arrangements of gendered and sexual practices “which works as a tacit sense of rightness and normalcy” (Lynch and Maree, 2013:460) by promoting heterosexuality as ‘compulsory’ (Riach et al, 2014). Heteronormativity can contribute with an explanation of the silenced practices of sexuality, discussed in Section 3.3, as silence is one of the dominant modes of constructing heterosexuality as the norm (Moran, 2011). As sexuality is rendered as a taboo topic within organizations, sexuality is perceived as not being present in organizations (Ward and Winstanley, 2003). Heteronormativity is thus reflected and constructed when heterosexuality is made apparent in interactions without being directly mentioned or talked about (Kitzinger, 2005). Similarly, cisnormativity refers to the expectation that “all people are cissexual, that those assigned male at birth always grow up to be men and those assigned female at birth always grow up to be women” (Bauer et al, 2009:356), erasing the experiences of trans* and non-binary people. Underpinned by gender-binary thinking assuming people to be exclusively woman or man, cisnormativity explains how essentialist identities forecloses gender fluidity (Bradford and Syed, 2019). Cisnormativity was introduced to challenge and question the taken-for-granted assumptions constructing cisgender men and women as ‘normal’ (Pyne, 2011), an “assumption so pervasive” it is barely spoken about (Bauer et al, 2009:356).  Through a hetero- and cisnormative lens, people come to believe that an individual is restricted to identify as either a heterosexual man or a heterosexual woman and as such only two genders thus two sexualities exists (Lehtonen, 2008). Heterosexual and cissexuals therefore generally assume they are working in a sexual and gender neutral workplace (Roberts, 2011), rather than in a workplace where heterosexuality and cisgenders dominates (Ward and Winstanley, 2003). The binary practices thus inhibit individuals’ agency to vary between two or more categories (Dietert and Dentice, 2009). For example, by restricting an individual to identity as either lesbian, gay, bisexual, woman or man, individuals are compelled to refer to themselves as belonging to 32  categories, which illustrate how cis- and heteronormativity influences the language used to talk about our lives (Gray, 2013) while foreclosing fluidity.   The linkages between sexuality and gender are thus vital in the analysis of heteronormativity as “regulation of gender has always been part of the work of heterosexist normativity” (Butler, 2004:186). Thus, by constructing a workplace based on essentialist assumptions about sexuality and gender, people assume that trans* people automatically become ‘straight’ upon transitioning to woman or man (Dietert and Dentice, 2009). As such, Pringle (2008) argues that gender and heterosexuality is inextricably linked, thus theorises gender in management as ‘heterogender’, which recognizes the centrality of heterosexual norms and values. Alterations to heterogender reveal the power associated with heterosexuality whereby non-conforming (hetero)sexualities are rendered the ‘abject other’. However, the inextricable link between sexuality and gender and cisnormativity is challenged by trans* people (Williams et al, 2013). An example is a US study with transmen conducted by Schilt and Westbrook (2009) who found that even though the transmen performed their gender by ‘doing’ heterosexuality and cisgender and participated in the dominant ‘heterogender’ arrangements, their sexuality could not be read or count as ‘legitimate’ (Ingraham, 1994) by co-workers. As such, the transmen’s heterosexuality was questioned, as they did not fit into the heteronormative expectations of sexuality and gender (Schilt and Westbrook, 2009). This might be due to the assumption that trans* people are hiding their true gender and are thus vulnerable for workplace outing as they are perceived as engaging in ‘gender dishonesties’ that are deemed rightfully punishable according to cis- and heteronormative practices (Ward and Schneider, 2009).   However, it is argued that in order for an identity to be read by the dominant group as intelligible, an identity needs to be presented in relation to socially appropriate norms (Kelan, 2010). As such, it is contended that individuals that are coming out as non-heterosexual are compelled to assimilate into a ‘straight’ culture in order to gain equal citizenship status as heterosexuals (Richardson, 2004). This was evident in a UK study by Benozzo et al (2015) where gay participants came out as being in a relationship with another man, which was seen as replicating heterosexual practices in order to be ‘read’ by heterosexuals as normal. As such, a gay identity was moving from the ‘private’ to the ‘public’ sphere whereby the participants came out as ‘normal citizens’ in workplace contexts by adhering to the intimate norms of marital-style relationships where ‘being’ gay is constructed as a social identity rather than a sexual identity (Richardson, 2004).  33   As such, Butler (1991) argues that if compulsory heterosexuality is the ‘norm’, then coming out as gay or lesbian is always a way of miming or ‘being’ a shadow of the ‘real’.  On the other hand, coming out by being in a relationship has been argued to control other possibilities to perform queerness (Benozzo et al, 2015). An example is a lesbian participant in Gray’s (2013) study on LGB teachers in the UK, who did not feel ‘free’ to ‘come out’ because she was not in a relationship with a woman. It is evident that the normalization of heterosexuality impacts the choice of words used to describe LGBTQIA individuals’ lives while at the same time signifying a speech even though it is not spoken about, which restricts open discussions about the experiences of LGBTQIA individuals (Gray, 2013). LGBTQIA individuals are often left with the only option of embracing cis- and heteronormative values in order to construct a ‘normal sense of self’ (Rumens, 2016b). Particularly as heterosexuality and cisgender tends to be assumed to be ‘natural’ and ‘compulsory’, it has often been neglected from examinations of workplace inequality. This is a vital limitation of the existing literature as research omits to examine how heterosexuality (re)produces and manifests itself as the ‘norm’ and how heterosexuals, in addition to LGBTQIA employees, negotiate heteronormativity in identity formation that is deemed ‘normal’ (Rumens, 2016a).   3.7.2 Hegemonic masculinity Similar to how heteronormativity structures many aspects of organizational life through its implicit norms surrounding gender and heterosexuality, hegemonic masculinity (Connell, 2005) is the prominent pattern of expectations regarding “normative heterosexual masculinity” that marginalizes those that are not (Dean, 2013:535). Hegemonic masculinity represents an ideal set of social norms that influence how men manage daily activities (Arxer, 2011) and is theorised as “the most honoured way of being a man” as it secures men’s dominant position and subordination of women (external hegemony) and over certain groups of men (internal hegemony) (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005:832; Arxer, 2011). Further, Connell (2005) argues hegemonic masculinity does not represent a fixed character type nor a singular version of masculinity; it is rather the power held by some men, which maintains and upholds a hierarchy between groups of men and between men and women (de Boise, 2015). Thus, hegemonic masculinity does not only subordinate femininities but also ‘other forms’ of masculinity (Schippers, 2007).  Furthermore, a key component in the construction of hegemonic masculinity is the heterosexual desire, which establishes masculinity as the complementary opposite of femininity in 34  heteronormative terms (Schippers, 2007). As such, Arxer (2011) argue that the body is an important site in which hegemonic masculine ideals are accomplished and includes traits and practices specific to sexual desire such as height, muscularity and size (Messerschmidt, 2012). Connell (2005:71) further argue that gender is constructed through the social practices that the body ‘do’ hence theorises gender as a ‘reproductive arena’. In this manner, hegemonic masculinity constructs the ‘ideal man’ as heterosexual, technically component, aggressive, physically strong, white, middle-class and family oriented (Embrick et al, 2007; Acker, 1990). Even though it is debatable whether hegemonic masculinity is ever achievable, it is normative in the sense that it requires other men to position themselves in relation to the hegemonic standards (Connell and Messerchmidt, 2005). Men that do not comply with the ‘ideal’ image of hegemonic masculinity are associated with women and are thus effeminized (Yeung et al, 2006).  According to this line of reasoning, gay men, for example, can ‘never’ meet the ideal hegemonic masculinity if they fail to demonstrate legitimate subordination of women (Filteau, 2014).   The effects of hegemonic masculinity consequently create perceptions of gayness by assimilating homosexuality to femininity (Connell, 2005). As such, Butler (1993) argue that gender cannot exist without gay and lesbian identities. By stereotyping gay men as effeminate in appearance, talkative and outspoken, the oppositional framework contributes in defining what a heterosexual man is not, hence what constitute hegemonic masculinity and what it is not (Eguchi, 2009). However, despite Connell’s (2005) attempt to move away from essentialist assumptions of gender, hegemonic masculinity is criticised for conflating femininity with women and masculinity with men (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005). While hegemonic masculinities are a societal privilege that places femininity in a subordinate position within patriarchal societies (Barratt et al, 2014), this does not take into account how femininities are privileged depending upon the specific context (Schippers. 2007).  3.7.3 Hostility towards LGBT people The meanings associated with homophobia vary and have changed considerably throughout the past decades. As such, homophobia has been defined as the fear among heterosexuals of being in the presence of homosexuals (Iudici and Verdecchia, 2015), the mental illness associated with homosexuality (Tomsen, 2006), and the negative stereotypes of non-heterosexual people and breach of commitment to gender conformity (Einarsdóttir et al, 2015). The roots of homophobia can be traced back to the time where homosexuality was seen as a medical symptom, where people 35  were afraid of “being homosexual oneself” (Tomsen, 2006:391). In the UK, for example, homosexual acts between men was criminalised by law until 1967, ten years after the ‘Wolfenden Report’ had recommended that the ‘law should not dictate private morality’ (Tatchell, 2017:unpaginated). Although this report suggested decriminalisation of homosexual acts performed in the private sphere, the recommendations sought to minimise the ‘spread’ of homosexuality by reducing homosexuality as a ‘private matter’ silencing sexual minorities (Derry, 2020). However, homophobia is in recent times generally defined as the bias or negative feelings that heterosexuals have towards homosexuals (Tomsen, 2006; Iudici and Verdecchia, 2015). As such, viewed as a social construct rather than ‘phobia’ in psychological terms, homophobia operates through interactions and observations where homosexual behaviour become devalued compared to heterosexual behaviours (McCann et al, 2009).   Further, Iudici and Verdecchia (2015:740) distinguishes between social homophobia and internalized homophobia. The former refer to the hostility of gays and lesbians that is manifested at an individual and societal level, whereas the latter refers to the prejudice internalized by people self-identifying as ‘homosexual’. Although the term has been theorised as empowering in terms of describing the hostility of the people who hold negative beliefs about lesbian and gay men instead of blaming the people associated with ‘homosexuality’, homophobia is not without its limitations (Eliason, 2000). The notion of homophobia is criticised for reinforcing mental illness, as ‘homophobia’ was originally meant to label mental health problems and therefore sought to explain how mental health issues experienced by homosexuals was a consequence of the hatred directed towards homosexual men (Tomson, 2006). Homophobia is further criticised for focusing primarily on gay men, not considering intersections of oppression including gender, race, ethnicity and social class and neglects to take into account the broader landscape of oppression of sexual orientation (Yep, 2002). As such, Herek (2000) argues that homophobia is better theorised as sexual prejudice.   Furthermore, Anderson (2015) claims that the significance of homophobia is decreasing and as such is no longer integral in constructing masculinity, thus theorises the fear of being perceived as gay as “homohysteria” (McCormack, 2014). Homohysteria is the regulatory power of homophobia, which works to describe and distinguish between cultures with “high” and “low” levels of homophobia (McCormack, 2014). There are several limitations with the theorisation of ‘homohysteria’, as homophobia is argued to be subjective and contextual hence difficult to measure as it varies within societies (de Boise, 2015). For example, Anderson et al (2012) argue that straight 36  men’s willingness to kiss each other demonstrates the decreased fear of being ‘homosexualized’. While this illustrates that sexuality is increasingly fluid, they conflate same-sex practices with homosexuality, which is what queer theory attempts to disavow (de Boise, 2015). Furthermore, Anderson (2015) and McCormack (2014) might be right in terms of conceptualising homophobia as less significant to hegemonic practices, primarily because homophobia is outlawed in the UK (de Boise, 2015). However, it does not mean that homophobic practices have disappeared. For example, a study by Colvin (2015) exploring the shared workplace experiences among lesbian and gay police officers in the UK, found that 54 per cent of officers identifying as gay men and 49 per cent of lesbians reported experiencing homophobic talk.   Similarly, a study by Einarsdóttir et al (2015), as part of an extensive Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded study, analysed 50 interviews with LGB employees on their experience with bullying, harassment and discrimination in UK workplaces. The findings illustrated it has become increasingly difficult to ‘define’ what constitutes homophobia, and found LGB individuals excuse their co-workers by indicating they did not “personally want to discriminate” hence denies the homophobic label (Einarsdóttir et al, 2015:1194). This study demonstrate the difficulties both among LGB individuals in making accusations of homophobia, and from the organization’s point of view, as they have to examine the underlying structures of the organization regarding heteronormativity in order to unravel how homophobia, implicitly, operate within the organizations (Einarsdóttir et al, 2015).   Additionally, transphobia, the societal discrimination and emotional aversion towards individuals that do not conform to societal norms concerning gender and sexuality, is also reflected in trans* individuals’ workplace experience (Nagoshi et al, 2008). Trans* people have been argued to represent a ‘category crisis’ whereby cultural, aesthetic and social ‘dissonances’ are disrupted while challenging the idea of identity as fixed or coherent (Hines, 2006). The ‘category crisis’ of gender identity was found as a cause of discrimination among gender non-conforming trans* people in the recruitment and selection process in a UK study by Ozturk and Tatli (2015), where trans* job seekers were regarded as the ‘other’ that could not be dealt with. This illustrate how trans* people that do not comply with restrictive social norms are regarded as unintelligible where their status as human beings are called into question as their identity is not readable by the ‘norm’ (Butler, 2004), which had severe consequences in terms of finding employment. However, discrimination was also experienced once hired where the fear of ‘transphobia’, in terms of 37  exclusion and stigmatisation, was a reason for non-disclosure among some respondents (Ozturk and Tatli, 2015).   Trans* identities are still seen by the public as constructed within a medical discourse where trans* individuals have to live in their designated gender identity for a given period of time in order to transition (Hines, 2006). By having to ‘live’ in their designated gender in all aspects of their lives, the man/masculine and woman/feminine binary is (re)produced as normal (Rumens and Broomfield, 2014). This was also stressed in a US study by Miller and Grollman (2015) with trans* individuals who found that 71 per cent of the respondents experienced transphobic discrimination on a daily basis, where trans* individuals read as gender nonconforming experienced more overt transphobic discrimination than gender conforming trans* individuals.   On the other hand, biphobia is the prejudice caused by negative stereotypes of people whose sexual orientation challenge the heteronormative heterosexual/homosexual binary (Mulick and Wright, 2002). However, empirical research on sexuality tend to neglect the workplace experience of bisexuals, which is noteworthy as bisexuals are found to experience higher levels of negative stereotypes by heterosexuals than do lesbians and gay men (McCormack et al, 2014). It is thus argued that bisexuals experience ‘double discrimination’ as they might not be able to access privilege as ‘straight’ and simultaneously not always being able to access gay and lesbian networks due to being ‘placed’ inside/outside the homosexual/heterosexual binary (Beckett, 2012; Callis, 2009). As such, a study by Hayfield et al (2013) on the invisibility among bisexual women, shows that although bisexual women may ‘do’ butchness, thereby making ‘queerness’ visible, bisexuals often have to navigate invisibility by either being read as “straight” or ‘lesbian’.   This restrict bisexuals from disclosing their sexuality, as bisexuality has been argued to be a ‘non-legitimate’ sexuality where bisexual individuals are assumed to be ‘confused’ about their sexual orientation as it is regarded as ‘just a phase’  (Eliason, 2000; Barker and Langdridge, 2008). These attitudes towards bisexuals contributes in ‘double silencing’ them as they are both restricted and missing the vocabulary to talk about their sexuality due to its complexity (Gray, 2013). Bisexuals are further targets of “compulsory monosexuality” because of the monogamous society that reads a bisexual who is in a relationship with either a woman or man as either homosexual or heterosexual (Callis, 2009). Although the heterosexuality/homosexuality binary attempts to restrict 38  fluidity between the dichotomies, it is evident that bisexuality threaten the essentialist view of sexuality as stable, which is upheld by heteronormativity (Gray, 2013).  3.8 Conclusions Chapters Two and Three aimed to discuss the limited research conducted on LGBTQIA peoples’ workplace experiences. Chapter Two uncovered how attitudes towards LGBTQIA people have improved in British society and workplaces as companies are becoming more ‘gay friendly’. However, the extant literature suggests social inequality is prevalent in the construction industry (Wright, 2013; Chan, 2013; Rumens, 2013; Wright, 2015), probation service (Beckett, 2012), police department (Colvin, 2015; Galvin-White and O’Neal, 2016) and the firefighter service (Ward and Winstanley, 2006). However, as uncovered in Chapter Two, more research is needed on LGBTQIA and heterosexual academics’ workplace experiences in higher education. Additionally, it is evident from the two preceding chapters that there is a paucity of research challenging heteronormativity by incorporating gender into the study of sexuality, which is vital as “regulation of gender has always been part of the work of heterosexist normativity” (Butler, 2004:186). The next chapter will therefore move on to discuss the theoretical framework guiding the current research, namely queer theory, which seeks to challenge essentialist and normative constructions of gender and sexuality.  39  Chapter 4 Queer theory: bringing gender back to the analysis  4.1 Introduction As noted at the end of Chapter Three, a theoretical framework capable of celebrating, rather than marginalizing those experiences and identities not easily subsumed under heteronormative practices is critical to the current study in order to question universal norms underpinning the normative (Martin, 1994). Indeed, it was evident in the preceding chapters that discourses around heteronormativity are one of the ways in which LGBTQIA individuals become marginalized as these continue to operates implicitly in everyday interactions without being noticed or challenged. One of the ways in which heteronormativity operates is through categorization that renders identities fixed and stable, which not only forms the basis for oppression, but also political power. However, these fixed categorizations are normative forces, or regulatory regimes, based on a set of underlying ‘norms’ (McDonald, 2015b) that are argued to be less relevant in British society where gender and sexual identities are becoming increasingly fluid and complex (Roberts, 2014). As such, the aim of this chapter is to discuss how queer theory as a framework can oppose heteronormativity. In particular, in an attempt to bring gender back to the discussion of sexuality, this research drew on Judith Butler’s work on ‘performativity’, which is discussed in Section 4.5, in order to examine the formation of gender and sexual identities, which has aided the struggles of sexually marginalized groups (Schep, 2012).   4.2 Origins of queer theory 4.2.1 Theoretical explanations of sexuality  The 19th and 20th century research on sexuality and gender was predominantly undertaken by sexologists, medical scholars, biologists and psychologists whereby gender and sexuality was seen as a ‘natural phenomena’ and their interrelatedness were found to be fixed and universal (Richardson, 2007). Until the end of the 20th century, homosexuality was mostly neglected from sociologist studies (Ward and Winstanely, 2005). Whereas psychological models to theorise sexuality include social learning theory that focused on the environment and personality to the construction of sexual behaviours that can be taught (Hogben and Byrne, 1998), sociologists focused on the social organization of homosexuality rather than behaviour per se. The publication of the Kinsey reports in 1948 and 1953 illustrated the difficulties associated with the ‘either/or’ approach to homosexuality/heterosexuality, thus defined sexuality as a continuum with heterosexuality and homosexuality at each side of the spectrum. Labelling theory, on the other hand, has been concerned with the ways in which people become categorised as ‘homosexuals’ 40  and with the research on deviancy (Plummer, 1975). As such, Mary McIntosh’s (1968) labelling theory moved away from homosexuality as a condition towards a ‘social role’ that segregated homosexuals as “deviant” and “normal” identities. This was a vital step towards locating the social functioning of homosexuals rather than a psychiatric or medicalized condition (Namaste, 1994.).   Furthermore, Simon and Gagnon (1984) drew on symbolic interactionism and social learning theory to argue that sexual behaviour could be understood as ‘sexual scripts’. For behaviour to occur, however, scripting must derive from three levels including cultural scenarios, interpersonal scripts and intra-psychic scripts that vary in different settings and contexts (Simon and Gagnon, 1984:53). Sexual scripting theory was introduced to further the understanding of how scripts create appropriate norms regarding sexual behaviour and experience (Stephens and Phillips, 2005). However, scripting theory has been criticised for prioritizing gender over sexuality (Richardson, 2007). While sociological perspectives to analyse sexuality, such as labelling theory and mainstream gay and lesbian studies have been influential to the examination of gay and lesbian ‘communities’ and ‘identities’, these theories are criticised for neglecting to examine the reproduction of heterosexuality and for rendering certain identities ‘normal’ and others ‘deviant’ (Green, 2002; Namaste, 1994). By assuming heterosexuality as the ‘norm’, research neglects to understand how heterosexuality operates, and the practices constituting heterosexuality (Danby, 2007). Additionally, sociological theorising of sex, gender and sexuality has usually assumed that a person has one sex, one sexuality and one gender, which are seen as separate attributes that constitute an identity (Valocchi, 2005; Lorber, 1996).   4.2.2 (Not) defining ‘queer’ theory The term ‘queer’ has been used in several, often conflating ways and there have been widespread debates around the ‘proper’ use of the term (Gamson, 1995). In order to clarify its complexity, O’Driscoll (1996) distinguishes between the ‘street’ usage and ‘theoretical’ usage of the term ‘queer’. The former refers to the sexuality of a particular group, often conflated with lesbian and gay men, and usually did not include other marginalized sexual subject positions such as bisexuality or trans* (Gammon and Isgro, 2006). This use of queer was, in particular, associated with activist groups such as Queer Nation and Act Up in the 1970s in order to mark an anti-assimilationist stance related with gay rights movements (Namaste, 1994; Gamson, 1995). However, historically, ‘queer’ was also used as a word to insult LGBT people (Namaste, 1998). On the other hand, the theoretical underpinning of queer refers to a methodology that deconstructs 41  the categorization of sexuality that emerged in the 1980s (O’Driscoll, 1996), first introduced by de Lauretis (1991) in the article titled ‘Queer Theory: Lesbian and Gay sexualities’. In the article, de Lauretis (1991:iii) argued queer:  “was arrived at in the effort to avoid all of these fine distinctions in our discursive protocols, not to adhere to any one of the given terms, not to assume their ideological liabilities, but instead to both transgress and transcend them – or at the very least problematize them”.   While neither Sedgwick nor Butler, who are canonical theorists in the field, uses the term ‘queer’ per se, Sedgwick (1990) notes that ‘queer’ can be used to reflect an anti-identity position, which indicates a rejection of normative categories. However, the anti-identity movement associated with queer theory does not argue for the end of categories, but rather to treat identities as open and contestable categories of ‘knowledge and politics’ (Seidman, 1994:173). There is also disagreement regarding the ‘inclusiveness’ of the term ‘queer’. Warner (1991) argues that queer, more often than not, has been regarded as a universalizing move by insisting that sexuality should be distinct from gender. Similarly, Parker (2002) argues that it is usually people identifying as LGBT that fall under the rubric of ‘queer’. On the other hand, Honeychurch (1996) argue that queer is not restricted to signify sexuality, as queer includes other practices that do not ‘fit’ the normative notions of sexual or gender practices. As such, queer can be used to problematize and question the underlying assumptions of conventional categories (man, woman, femme, butch), oppositions (man/woman, heterosexual/homosexual, feminine/masculine) as well as equations (gender equals sexuality) by deconstructing the sex, gender and sexuality taxonomy (Walters, 1996). This has also been taken up by theorists who claim that since queer is not equated to sexual relations between people of the ‘same’ gender, then ‘queering’ normative assumptions of ‘straight sex’ can destabilise the very notions of gender and sexuality (Better and Simula, 2015). Queer has thus been argued to not limit its analysis to the heterosexual/homosexual binary as historical constructs, but also those modes of embodiment that cannot be explained through the sex of object choice including leatherplay, S/M, intersexuality and queer heterosexual as these identity formations fall outside of the heterosexual/homosexual binary (Valocchi, 2005).  Queer has also been, theoretically, referred to as a verb ‘queering’, which is concerned with deconstructing and interrogating “social and cultural norms” (Rumens, 2013:807), which will be discussed in Section 4.3. Queering, as an activity, can be used to ‘make sense’ of the boundaries 42  between the respectable (normative heterosexual practices) and the disrespectable (anything that transgresses heteronormativity) and its associated costs (Danby, 2007). This leads to a new understanding of queer as, according to Halperin (1997:62) “by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant. There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers”. The term queer is therefore not regarded as an identity category, but a positionality where anyone who feel marginalized, as a consequence of their sexual practices or gender identity, can identify including heterosexuals, married couples with or without children etc. (Halperin, 1997). This is important as it opens up the possibility of examining heterosexual practices that fall outside of normative heterosexual practices (McDonald, 2015b). Rather than being anti-heterosexuality, queer theory denotes an anti-normative stance. However, the question “what makes straight heterosexuality queer?” is still unanswered (Walters, 1996).  While queer has been regarded as a subject position (Green, 2002), the post-structuralist underpinning of queer theory rejects categorization as derived from ‘regulatory regimes’ thus situates the person as free and distinct from situations that would “limit its definition” (Kirsch, 2006:28). Queer theory thus examines how categories such as ‘lesbian’, ‘bisexual’ and ‘queer’ emerges (Namaste, 1994). What this discussion illustrates is that queer, both in politics and as a theory, holds the possibility to challenge stable and fixed identities and the very defining institutions, as the theory recognizes that identities slip from rigid heterosexual/homosexual and woman/man binaries by rejecting ‘minorizing’ logic (Walters, 1996).   Queer theory has therefore often been theorised as a ‘replacement’ for feminist theory and lesbian and gay studies as it criticised both studies for maintaining the binaries (Walters, 1996). The separation between sexuality and gender has therefore been axiomatic for queer studies because of the critique of feminism for stabilising women as a category (Jagose, 2009). Section 4.4 will therefore discuss how the separation between gender and sexuality came to the forefront of queer theory, in order to propose Butler’s (1999) ‘performativity’ theory as a suitable framework to theorise the shared aims and overlaps between feminist and queer projects. As such, in the current research, queer theory was defined through its possibility to transcend and problematize heteronormative categories and assumptions of everyday life through its examination of the webs of power to which these categories are (re)produced. As such, following Butler (1999), the current research views sex, sexuality and gender as interrelated and connected, although not to the extent that they can never be analysed separately (Rumens, 2008). Drawing on Foucault (1979), Butler 43  (1993) argues that objects does not pre-exist the situation, but rather are a result of “truth effects” that is constituted within discourse. Performativity will be utilised to the examination of how academics may problematize the coherence of sex, sexuality and gender.   4.2.3 Foucault Emerging from academic conferences in the 1980s, with roots in humanities, “queer theory” was developed to challenge the stable and conventional identities (gay, lesbian, heterosexual, homosexual, female, male) associated with lesbian and gay studies (Gamson, 1995) and feminist studies (Jagose, 2009). Rather than regarding categorizations such as homosexual as arbitrary or accidental (Weeks, 1981), queer theory is informed by Michel Foucault’s anti-essentialist theorisation on sexuality as historically constructed rather than a biological essence (Foucault, 1979). Even though Foucault’s (1979) influential book ‘The History of Sexuality: The will to knowledge’ was published a decade before ‘queer theory’ emerged, it is argued that the theorisation of sexuality as a discursive construct “was the main initial catalyst for queer theory” (Spargo, 2000:26). Foucault (1979) proposed a genealogical method to illustrate how experiences, such as homosexuality, became objects of institutional knowledge (medical, scientific, psychiatric), which opened the possibility for understanding how certain behaviours became attached to identities, rather than acts during the eighteenth century society. Viewing ‘sex’ as an identity regime, Foucault argued that identities were unstable as the individual was constructed through discourse, and it is through discourse that knowledge and power become united. The objective, Foucault argued, was to examine particular forms of knowledge regarding sex and the modern categorization of the heterosexual or homosexual, which were created by ‘expert’ knowledge associated with medicalization, psychiatric conferences, law and education systems whereby the ‘sinful’ acts became identities, or a kind of a ‘person’ (Green, 2010). In this manner, Foucault argued that the central issue is to determine who does the speaking, the institutions that allow people to speak about it and the viewpoints they hold in order to examine how sex is “put into discourse” (1979:11).   During the eighteenth century, however, new discourses emerged, which rendered silence an important device of discourse. While pointing out that a binary between the things said and not said is non-existent, Foucault suggests it is necessary to determine the different ways of not saying things, which meant that silence needed to be incorporated into the investigation of sexualities as it permeates discourses. Taking the example of secondary schools, Foucault argued that sex was discussed, often implicitly, all the time as it was embedded in the silenced discourses that the 44  institutions attempted to conceal. Discourse thus produces and reproduces normalcy as homosexuality is defined by appropriate knowledge, which locates power in the norm (Simpson and Lewis, 2005). It is the regime of sexuality, the knowledge that construct what is sexual, that queer theory seeks to challenge (Seidman, 1994). More precisely, queer theorists view heterosexuality and homosexuality as categories of knowledge rather than identities, and investigates how normative language determine the knowledge of “bodies, desires, sexualities, and identities” (Seidman, 1994:174).   It is through the refusal to categorize where queer theory drifts from gay and lesbian studies of sexuality (Kirsch, 2006). Arguing that definitions and regulations organize sexuality or sexual categories (Weeks, 1981), Foucault’s genealogical inquiry seeks to centre and de-centre on the defining institutions, such as heteronormativity, that organizes sexual identities into categories (Butler, 1999). It is the institutional discourses whereby sexuality is constructed that Foucault pursues to locate, which becomes the “regimes of truth” (Stein and Plummer, 1994:183). Following Foucault’s notion of sexuality as a historical construct, queer theory builds on the importance of moving beyond perspectives that define non-heterosexual categories in opposition to a normal, stable heterosexuality (Namaste, 1994) through deconstruction.   4.3 Deconstructing the homosexual/heterosexual binary Drawing on post-structuralist deconstruction techniques, queer theory seeks to expose the historical constitution of the sexual subject through ‘sense-making’ of how categories, such as ‘homosexual’ and ‘heterosexual’, came to be viewed as fixed and stable identities rather than a discursive effect (Watson, 2005; Green, 2002). Furthermore, queer theory draws on the work by Derrida (1998) who has been particularly influential to the work on deconstruction. He argued that the meanings associated with homosexual and heterosexual are derived from the oppositional difference between the identities (Namaste, 1994). This oppositional difference is a concept he termed ‘supplementary’, which Derrida (1998:244), in ‘Of Grammatology’, argues:  “is nothing, neither a presence nor an absence, is neither a substance nor an essence of man. It is precisely the play of presence and absence, the opening of this play that no metaphysical or ontological concept can comprehend”.  45  In this way, Derrida illustrate that “what appears to be outside a given system is always already fully inside it; that which seems to be natural is historical” (Namaste, 1994:222). This is particularly evident by considering the opposition of heterosexuality and homosexuality, as homosexuality relies on heterosexuality in order to be defined (Namaste, 1994.). Beaver (1981:115) argues that the aim of a deconstruction strategy is to “reverse the rhetorical opposition” of what is conceived to be ‘normal’ and what is ‘abnormal’, such as homosexuality and heterosexuality, by questioning the privilege of heterosexuality, which needs to be treated as a dependent term with its own history to be analysed (Spargo, 2000). This forms the basis of the influential work by Sedgwick (1990) who in her canonical book ‘Epistemology of the Closet’, deconstructs the concept of organizing categories:  “The dividing up of all sexual acts – indeed all persons – under the “opposite” categories of “homo” and “hetero” is not a natural given but a historical process, still incomplete today and ultimately impossible but characterized by potent contradiction and explosive effects” (1990:xvi).   Rather than dividing sexual acts, that is converted into persons, under the oppositional dichotomy of ‘homosexual’ or ‘heterosexual’, queer theory resists the heterosexual/homosexual categorizations which is to be viewed as a “volatile act” rather than a fact of a person (Sedgwick, 1990). However, Sedgwick is criticised for dismissing the Derridean concept of deconstruction (Hite, 2017). For example, although Sedgwick uncouples binaries at a cultural level, Seidman (1995:134) suggests Sedgwick abandon Derrida’s original intention of institutional analysis, which insists “on linking discursive meanings to their institutional settings and thereby connecting deconstructive to institutional critique”. By ignoring ‘the entire history of Western philosophy’ in her deconstructive accounts focusing instead on cultural categories, Sedgwick is further criticised for not engaging with the notion of différance, which is supposed to be “the motor behind the logic of opposition Sedgwick outlines” (Kollias, 2012:148).  However, queer theory seeks, in particular, to challenge the social categories of knowledge and hierarchies, including binary oppositions such as heterosexuality/homosexuality and masculinity/femininity (Seidman, 1995). Challenging methodological and epistemological assumptions underpinning “man”, “woman”, “heterosexual” and “homosexual” as objects to be studied, queer studies argue for the possibility of unstable subjectivities that question assumptions 46  of heteronormative gender and sexuality (Brown and Nash, 2010). For example, trans* identities have called into question the cis- and heteronormative identity discourse of a stable sex/gender and sexuality (Green, 2010). Despite challenging cisgender as the only ‘natural’ sex/gender identification, trans* identities are rendered unintelligible within the binary system seeking to erase trans* and non-binary peoples’ experiences (Collier and Daniel, 2019; Sumerau et al, 2019). However, trans* movements have demonstrated the need to move beyond binary thinking of the sex and gender system to introduce a wider set of identifications and embodiments (Green, 2010). This can be illustrated in Hansbury’s (2005) study of ‘transmasculinity’, which is understood as a broad category that defines a person that is, usually, assigned ‘female’ at birth but feels more masculine in identification than female but whose identity cannot be subsumed under the woman/man binary (Green, 2010). Although Hansbury’s (2005:245) findings suggested three core categories of subjects emerged, namely ‘woodworkers, transmen and genderqueers’, a wider range of identifications were presented including “man of transsexual experience”, “genderqueer”, “passing woman”, “ungendered”, just curious”.  One way in which deconstruction works is to challenge sexual identities and classifications (lesbian, gay, heterosexual, bisexual) as the effects of discourse, where these categories are to be seen as fictions derived from hegemonic discourses (Green, 2002). For example, ‘queer’ has been used as an identity that refuses the terms associated with hegemonic discourses (Halperin, 1997; Walters, 1996). However, even the term ‘queer’ in its deconstructive move has been argued to not suffice as an identification as found in a US study by Better and Simula (2015) on queer heterosexuality that aimed to ‘trouble’ the categories available in normative sexual orientation. The authors interviewed 39 people working in sex-stores and 32 interviews with BDSM practitioners and found most of the participants did not feel at ease with the available categories to describe their sexual orientation as attraction could not be explained by the gender of sexual or romantic partners (Better and Simula, 2015). As such, Green (2007:28) argues that “denaturalization through deconstruction” is at the core of a ‘queer epistemology’. The next section will discuss the ways to which queer theory’s deconstruction raison d’etre can be used to denaturalise (hetero)normative terrains that have been taken for granted because of the invisibility of heterosexuality.  4.3.1 Deconstructing normative views on the family  47  As mentioned in the previous section, queer theory interrogates heterosexual terrains in order to deconstruct the binaries that are sustained within institutions by making ‘strange’ normative, known and conventional assumptions (McDonald, 2015a). Put another way, queer theory seeks to challenge normative views by offering alternative explanations of social life that appear ‘strange’ because of the lack of conventional knowledge (McDonald, 2015a). In troubling gendered and sexual identities, queer theory deconstructs the defining institutions by removing the norms from their ‘usual’ place by creating an ‘enabling disruption’ (Smith, 2013) and the ‘family’ can be such a disruption. The family has been an important site for the deployment of sexuality where discourses such as “the feminine body, regulations of births and specification of the perverted” has contributed in (re)producing the husband-wife/parents-child binaries, also referred to as the modern understanding of the ‘family’ (Foucault, 1979:108). As such, the family, according to Foucault, is the “most active site of sexuality” and reproduction of power (Foucault, 1979:109). Just as sexuality is an historical construct, the ‘family’ needs to be treated as unstable term that can be contested.   The “queering of the family” is therefore important as it questions the naturalness and normativity of both heterosexuality and homosexuality (Roseneil and Budgeon, 2004:141). The critique of sexuality and gender as two distinct areas of analysis, which will be discussed in detail in Section 4.4, has further implication with regards to the family, as they are both linked to the “reproduction of the normative family” (Butler, 1997:272). As discussed in Section 3.7.1 of the preceding chapter, heteronormativity refers to the normalizing and naturalizing of heterosexuality through a set of norms that not only make homosexuality its binary opposite, but also make heterosexuality seem ‘right’ and ‘compulsory’ (Valocchi, 2005). Heteronormativity ensures that ‘heterosexuals’ or ‘homosexuals’ are viewed as essential categories of people rather than fluid and changing constructs (Danby, 2007). Heteronormative ideologies are also mobilized through the family, which remain an important site of reproduction, both culturally and biologically, in order to reassure certain forms of relationships remain normative (Chevrette, 2013).   From a queer theoretical lens, it is possible to examine the ways in which non-normative families and practices challenge the nuclear family and ultimately the gendered and sexual categories embedded within the discourse (Gamson and Moon, 2004). The term “family of choice” have been used to mark a stance away from the heteronormative nature of family relationship to include non-normative relationships and friendships associated with gay and lesbians (Roseneil and Budgeon, 48  2004). For example, a UK based study by Zitz et al (2014) utilised a Foucauldian discourse analysis to examine the construction of both gender and friendship among trans* men. The findings revealed that the natural view of the family is redefined from biological interpretations, as participants tended to construct what others would call friends as their family (Zitz et al, 2014). As such, Weeks et al (2001) argues that when friends become peoples’ families, they move away from assumptions of gender as a structuring aspect of family practices/relations.   Additionally, a qualitative German study conducted by Dionisius (2015) with 21 lesbian couples seeking to start a family through donor insemination examined the ways in which lesbian couples reject family structures associated with heteronormativity and the importance of deconstructing the heteronormative ‘nuclear family’/queer ‘family of choice’ dichotomy. For example, reflecting on becoming a parent, one of the narratives presented by a married, lesbian woman illustrated the ways in which being ‘queer’ challenged the language used to describe the family but also how normative assumptions of mother/feminine/heterosexual is naturalized and deconstructed. Rather than conforming to norms associated with ‘mother/father’, the interviewee explained that her wife defined herself as a ‘parent’, detached from gender expectations, as she was often mistaken as the father (Dionisius, 2015). In the narrative, femininity and masculinity are deconstructed from the very notion of parenthood, which illustrate that non-normative family practices are able to deconstruct gender by creating an ontological crisis both in language and sexuality (Butler, 1999). Similarly, a study by Gabb (2005) with lesbian parent families found that the parents disrupted normative views of mother/feminine by practicing femininity and masculinity in ways that did not reflect ‘male’ and ‘female’ bodies. For example, three parents identified themselves as ‘lesbian fathers’, which demonstrate the ways in which lesbian parenthood can ‘trouble’ conventional gender roles and language underpinning heteronormative families (Gabb, 2005). However, in rejecting the compulsory coherence of sex, gender and sexuality, there is a risk of portraying a gender that is not regarded as intelligible by the ‘norm’ (Butler, 1999: Callis, 2009).   As discussed in Chapter Two, there have been several changes both in attitudes and legislative framework to protect LGBTQIA people. This has been argued, however, to result in assimilating LGBTQIA people to a heteronormative society where heteronormative privilege is extended to ‘normative’ gay and lesbian people, known as homonormatvity (Garwood, 2016). Homonormativity is defined by Duggan (2002:179) as “a politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions and institutions by upholds and sustains them”. This has resulted in 49  privileging certain sexualities over others including, but not limited to, cisgender, white, middle-class, Western, lesbian, gay, married and family oriented couples (Duggan, 2002). A qualitative US study by Pfeffer (2012) examined the ways in which trans* families are formed through interviews with 50 cisgender women in relationship with trans* men. Despite the finding that 52 per cent identified as queer, most of the participants were misperceived to be heterosexual couples in public with their trans* partner hence sought to ensure they were not “perceived as everyone else” (Pfeffer, 2012:586). Thus, rather than conforming to heteronormative assumptions around marriage, monogamy and parenting, the findings illustrated the ways in which these women negotiated and resisted assimilation to a “straight” culture by making their queer identity visible and dis-identifying as “straight” (Pfeffer, 2012). As such, instead of mimicking heteronormative relationships, the findings show how non-normative forms of relationship resist and challenge heteronormativity, which is at the core of queer theory.  4.3.2 Deconstructing normative views on organizational life The deconstructive move of queer theory can also be utilised in order to oppose ‘normalizing structures’, that is not directly related to ‘heterosexuality’ or gender and sexuality, towards queering accounting (Rumens, 2016b), management (Parker, 2002) and public administration (Lee et al, 2008). As such, Rumens and Tyler (2015) argues that queer theory’s deconstruction move over the last decade have been used in organizational studies in two ways. Firstly, through the ‘queering’ of normality away from sexuality, and the second approach is concerned with the ‘lived experiences’ of LGBTQIA and heterosexual people and the ways in which heteronormativity is produced and reproduced in organizations.   Both of these approaches has been utilised in a UK study by Lee et al (2008:154) who used queer theory to analyse three separate case studies, the first were with “men that have sex with men” and the last two case studies attempted to queer public administration. The first case study illustrated the ways in which non-heterosexual managers working with sexual health promotions embodied ‘manager’ through a heterosexual male identity by referring to gay men who they provided service to as the homosexual ‘other’ by using words such as “they”. Drawing on the ‘lessons’ from this case study, the authors sought to ‘queer’ public administration and found that being an outsider of the organizational culture rendered participants with a feeling of being “abnormal”, or “queer”, while becoming “normalized” once absorbed into the culture (Lee et al, 2008). The second case 50  study demonstrates an understanding of how queer theory can be used to deconstruct ‘normativity’ within public administration.  Rumens (2016b) on the other hand proposes a study to deconstruct the normative views underpinning accounting as well as opposing the heteronormative views on sexuality within accounting through ‘disruption of heteronormativity’, ‘queering accounting organizations’ and ‘queer allies in accounting context’ by bringing LGBT people to the forefront. Additionally, viewing ‘management’ as a form of performance or a social ‘doing’, Parker (2002) draws on Butler’s ‘performativity’ theory to argue that management can be viewed as ‘drag’ in order to oppose management as a social construct. Parker (2002) thus analyses the various ways in which queer theory can be used to ‘queer’ management by combining academic ‘theory’ and management ‘practice’. This means that queer theory can be used to trouble all social arrangements and whatever seems to constitute ‘normal’ (McDonald, 2015b).  4.4 Feminism vs. queer theory = sexual subjects without genders Within post-structuralist and feminist theories, there have been argued that a variety of power regimes have been thought to produce concepts of the sexed identity (Butler, 1999). Queer theory seeks to locate the power regimes, such as political representation for feminist enquiry and compulsory heterosexuality for queer theorists, that assumes ‘identity’ to be a stabilising concept of sex, gender and sexuality (Butler, 1999). The different ontological and epistemological views on sex, gender and sexuality have, therefore, been reflected in the studies undertaking these areas (Callis, 2009). Feminism, for example, has been critiqued by queer theorists for the overt focus on gender and the inherited assumptions of heterosexuality that have become idealized (Jagose, 2009; Martin, 1994; Butler, 1999). This stems from queer studies critique of feminism for separating sex from gender by reducing gender to two possibilities; either man or woman and to be a ‘real’ woman or man is to be heterosexual (Martin, 1994). This has further resulted in delegating gender to feminist studies and sex and sexuality to queer projects, which is argued to be the key distinction between the two theoretical studies (Jagose, 2009). However, does this mean that queer studies are theorising “sexualities without genders” (Martin, 1994)? Drawing on the work of Gayle Rubin and Eve Sedgwick, this section aims to illustrate the difficulties in separating the studies, and the ways in which feminist thought and queer studies together can articulate the “traffic between gender and sexuality” (Jagose, 2009:172) through sexual and gender performativity, which is discussed in Section 4.5. 51   4.4.1 Gayle Rubin Seeking to move away from structuralism, Gayle Rubin’s (1975) influential essay “the traffic in women”, sought to question feminism as the canonical site of analysing sexuality. This was because she argued that women’s studies tended to conflate gender with sexuality hence failing to distinguish between gender as oppositional to sexual and erotic desire. As such, Rubin argues that ‘sexual minorities’, such as transsexuals, transvestites, S/M and leather men are oppressed in a system that is distinctive from that of gender (Jeffreys, 1994). This oppressive system is termed the “sex/gender system”, which draws particularly on Freud, Lacan, Engels and Lévi-Strauss to discuss the ways in which sexuality is socially organized. She uses Levi-Strauss’ kinship system to illustrate how gender identities in some ways could be derived from kinship relations as well as a service of compulsory heterosexuality. She thus defines the “sex/gender system” as object of feminist inquiry as “the set of arrangements by which a society transforms biological sexuality into products of human activity, and in which these transformed sexual needs are satisfied” (Rubin, 1975:159). In this system, Rubin extends the meaning of ‘sex’ to include both ‘sex’ as in ‘female’ and ‘male’, but also ‘sex’ as in sexual activity, the verb to have sex. She thus argue that “sex as we know it - gender identity, sexual desire and fantasy, concepts of childhood” should also be regarded as a social product (1975:166). However, in a later essay “Thinking sex: notes for a radical theory of the politics of sexuality”, she acknowledge conflating gender with sexuality in “the traffic in women” and thus argue for sexuality and gender to be treated as separate analytic axes:  “gender affects the operation of the sexual system, and the sexual system has had gender specific manifestations. But although sex and gender are related, they are not the same thing, and they form the basis of two distinct areas of social practice” (Rubin, 1999:170).  Rubin, therefore, questions feminism as the privileged site for analysing sexuality as the oppression of lesbians should not be subsumed under the oppression of women, as lesbians experience inequalities and are oppressed for other reasons than by virtue of being women (such as being viewed as perverts), which is caused by sexual rather than gender stratification (Rubin, 1999). The analytic separation of sexuality and gender thus stands in stark contrast with previous feminist ideology. In particular MacKinnon’s comparison of sexuality in feminism as being linked to what “work is to Marxism” whereas she regarded gender as “an effect of sexuality, which organizes society into two sexes, women and men” (1982:516). MacKinnon further acknowledged that 52  sexuality derives from the gender relations by which men dominate and subordinate women (Jeffereys, 1994). Here MacKinnon uses gender and sex interchangeably whereas sex becomes gender, but also restricts the gendered possibilities to two options; either man or woman, which has been common in feminist inquiry (Martin, 1994).    4.4.2 Eve Sedgwick In ‘Epistemology of the Closet’, Eve Sedgwick (1990) outlines several axioms for anti-homophobic analysis which underpins the aim of the book, namely to deconstruct the modern Western cultural understandings of the homo/hetero definition. Similar to Rubin’s attempt to separate gender from sexuality, Sedgwick’s second axiom seeks to deconstruct sexuality and gender from one another in order to illustrate how anti-homophobic inquiry is not equivalent to feminist study. Sedgwick starts with a critique of feminist analysis for separating ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ where the former is made irreducible to chromosomal sex (XX and XY chromosomes), which she argues is “seen as the relatively minimal raw material on which is then based the social construction of gender” (1990:27). Gender, then, is viewed as a dichotomous social construction that (re)produces ‘male’ and ‘female’ identities that are defined in relation to each other. Arguing that feminists downplay the role of biological sex and make binary distinctions, Sedgwick defines the sex/gender distinction as “the system by which chromosomal sex is turned into, and processed as, cultural gender” (1990:28).   However, Sedgwick further decides to downgrade gender and sex under the rubric of ‘gender’, however, with no clear distinction between the terms.  On the other hand, there are arguably benefits of distinguishing sex from gender as it results in opening up the possibility of gender fluidity (Walters, 1996). This entails that the meanings associated with ‘man’ and ‘masculine’ might be deconstructed hence just as much to denote a ‘female’ body as a ‘male’ body whereas ‘feminine’ and ‘woman’ might signify a ‘male’ body (Butler, 1999). However, this separation is not the same as in the feminist view, as the aim is rather to expose ‘sex’ as not an interior ‘truth’ of ‘being’ (Butler, 1999). This is important as it allows for a variety of gendered subjects outside the binary of woman/feminine and man/masculine, which has been the case in much feminist work. However, bearing the difficulties associated with feminism of distinguishing between ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ in mind, Butler argues that “perhaps this construction called “sex” is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it [sex] was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all” (1999:10).  53   Furthermore, drawing on Rubin’s sex/gender system, Sedgwick notes that while the concept of heterosexuality/homosexuality would not exist without the concept of gender, other dimensions of sexual choice might not be directly connected with gender. Sedgwick thus regards gender and sexuality as two distinct analytic axes, although connected, but in opposition to each other, in order to open up the possibility for deconstruction. However, in “against proper objects”, Butler (1994) questions Sedgwick’s understanding of Gayle Rubin’s “sex/gender system”. Whereas Rubin sought to separate gender from sexuality in order to provide a framework in which a range of sexual minorities are linked, hence not restricted to gay and lesbians, Sedgwick understands sexuality to be linked to lesbian and gay identities (Butler, 1994). This is also argued to be the case of lesbian and gay studies where sexual practice are conformed into identity markers (O’Driscoll, 1996). Sedgwick is further criticised for collapsing sex and gender without a conceptual clarity, which makes male homo/heterosexuality exempt and distinct from gender thus from the body as a whole which renders women’s bodies marked and men’s bodies unmarked (Martin, 1994). Whereas Sedgwick considers gender and sexuality as distinct analytic axes, particularly the male homo/hetero divide, there are vital disadvantages of analysing sexuality without a reference to gender, as Judith Butler argue:  “If sexuality is conceived as liberated from gender, then the sexuality that is “liberated” from feminism will be one which suspends the difference to masculine and feminine, reinforcing the refusal to mark that difference, which is the conventional way in which the masculine has achieved the status of the “sex” which is one” (1997:20).   One of the ways in which the difficulty in separating gender studies from sexuality studies is accounted for is through Butler’s genealogical inquiry of gender and sexual ‘performativity’. This allows for an exploration of the interconnectedness and unimagined displays of sexuality and gender, for example, the ways in which “gender is sexed and sexuality is gendered” in ways that are not regarded as normative (Valocchi, 2005:753). This recognizes the overlaps and interrelatedness of queer and feminist projects (Jagose, 2009), which allows queer theorists to rethink sexual and gendered identities (Callis, 2009) by examining the linkage between discourse and identity (Watson, 2005), which will be discussed more in the next section.  Rather than viewing sex as a naturalized ‘core’ of self that transform ‘females’ into ‘women’, Butler  (1999) argues that gender, sex and sexuality are performatively enacted significations. 54   4.5 Performativity: queer and feminist genealogy  Although argued to be a canonical queer theorist, Judith Butler identifies primarily as a feminist theorist that seeks to subvert and critique ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ within feminist studies, by opposing the radical separation of sexuality from gender (Butler, 1996). Drawing on the work by de Beauvoir, Wittig, Kristeva, Lacan, Lévi-Strauss, Irigaray, Freud and Foucault, Judith Butler (1999), in ‘Gender Trouble’ attempts to “trouble” the fixed categorizations associated with sex, gender and sexuality as compulsory cultural performances by rethinking the possibilities of gendered and sexual life. In particular, the text seeks to oppose the regimes that render certain gendered expressions ‘true’ and others ‘false’. Butler thus asks “how do non-normative sexual practices call into question the stability of gender as a category of analysis?” and the ways in which these sexual practices challenge the essentialist views of what constitute a woman and a man (Butler, 1999:xi). Butler does not argue that sexual practices construct genders, but rather that normative heterosexual practices polices genders that are used as a way of ensuring that heterosexuality is secured. Drawing on psychoanalysis in order to account for the ways in which sexuality is formed within a heterosexual frame, Butler argues that homosexuality is associated with unintelligibility, particularly lesbianism that is often concerned with the desexualisation of the female body (1996; 1999). As previously discussed, Butler’s performativity theory includes some similarities with Mackinnon’s view of sexuality and gender, but differentiate in terms of focus. Whereas MacKinnon argues that the sexual hierarchy produces gender, rather than normative heterosexuality, she accepts a heterosexual view of sexuality where ‘being’ gendered means entering into a heterosexual form of subordination (Butler, 1996; 1999).  Butler, on the other hand, argues that heterosexuality becomes normative according to the ‘heterosexual matrix’ (Butler, 1999). This system presumes that sex (female, male) is articulated through a gender (feminine, masculine) and then through sexuality (heterosexuality, homosexuality) in a coherent manner that produces stable identities, which is hierarchically and relationally defined through compulsory heterosexuality (Butler, 1999). According to this framework, ‘being’ a woman implies being feminine hence heterosexual. However, a woman that, for example, has sex with someone of the “same” gender, thus transgresses and transcends this framework, might fear losing a sense of place in the gender order, hence causing ‘gender trouble’ (Butler, 1999:xi).   55  Drawing on Monique Wittig’s concept of the “heterosexual contract” in order to create the ‘heterosexual matrix’, Wittig argues that ‘sex’ is seen as always feminine under the system of compulsory heterosexuality as the masculine is unmarked hence regarded as ‘universal’ (Butler, 1999). According to this system, Wittig argues that “a lesbian is not a woman” by refusing heterosexuality, hence is not ‘sexed’ as the category of ‘woman’ is always in opposition ‘man’, a relation that is heterosexual. As such, ‘sex’ is a gendered category where no person is not born a woman, but becomes a woman. Additionally, female is also an act of becoming; however, a person can choose to neither become a woman or a female or male nor man by becoming a lesbian, which can be viewed as a third gender (O’Driscoll, 1996). As such, according to Wittig, gay or lesbian people have the opportunity to deconstruct the heterosexual regime, hence positions heterosexuality as a normative sexual position that all sexualities, including lesbians and gay men deviate.  Butler however argues that there are other compulsory displays of power, other than heterosexuality, that informs sexuality, hence argues that heterosexuality is both a compulsory system and a constant parody. Butler, in this manner, draws on butch and femme desires to illustrate how non-heterosexual practices can deconstruct the heterosexual gender regime by using the example of a ‘femme’ (feminine lesbian) that characterise butches as her sexual object of desire by saying “she likes her boys to be girls” (Butler, 1999:167). It is thus not the female body or the masculine identity that is the object of the lesbian femme’s sexual desire, but rather the “erotic interplay” (Butler, 1999:167). This is also the case for bisexual and heterosexual women who may prefer that their girls are boys whereas the ‘male’ body might as well be juxtaposed with a feminine identity. This is built on a “ground” (sexed body) and “figure” (butch or femme identity) strategy that opens up possibilities for alternative explanations of gendered exchanges of desire as butch and femme identities cannot be viewed as a copy of heterosexuality. Heterosexuality is thus positioned as an unstable, unnatural, constructed, political category.   Having considered the construction of intelligible gendered identities through compulsory heterosexuality, Butler goes on to argue that when heterosexual, bisexual, gay and lesbian bodies disrupt the heterosexual coherence of gender, the heterosexual matrix might “lose its descriptive force” (Butler, 1999:185). These practices can thus be regarded as ‘performativity in action’, which means that sexual and gender identities are constituted through reiterative acts whereby gender and sexuality, eventually, become naturalized. The becoming of the subject is, rather than a biological 56  essence, a repeated performance of language and material acts whereas subjectivity is a constant and repetitive ‘doing’, rather than “a state of being”, which is produced discursively (Bunch, 2013:44). Challenging the foundationalist underpinning of identity politics whereby an identity must be in place for political stakes to be elaborated, Butler argues “there need not to be a doer behind the deed”, as the deed constructs the doer (Butler, 1999:195).   4.5.1 Ontology of performativity By regarding the gendered and sexual body as ‘performative’, Butler argues that there is no ontological status other than the reiterative acts that constitute its reality. In this manner, reality is an effect and function fabricated as an interior essence that constructs an illusion of a gender. This illusion is regulated by sexuality within the compulsory frame of reproductive heterosexuality (Butler, 1999:185-186). The ontological effects are, therefore, established through performativity or, in other words, “performativity is the discursive mode by which ontological effects are established” (Butler, 1996:112). This is because, as Butler argues, “there is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is performatively constituted by the very ‘expressions’ that are said to be its results” (1999:34). In this manner, a person ‘is’ not ‘gay’, ‘straight, ‘queer’, but is rather doing, for example, ‘straightness’ or ‘queerness’ that is fluid and open for re-citation (Lloyd, 1999). ‘Gender Trouble’, thus proposes a genealogical inquiry of gender as an ‘effect’ that seeks to examine the political stakes of the construction in the mode of ontology rather than searching for origins (Butler, 1999). Gender is therefore theorised as “the repeated stylization of the body” that seeks to produce a natural self of ‘being’, and if successful, the genealogy of gender ontology seeks to deconstruct the acts that constitute gender and locate the acts within the compulsory frames (Butler, 1999:43).   4.5.2 ‘Drag’ In her discussion of gender performativity, particularly the view that gender and sexual identities is not derived from an ‘original’ or ‘primary’ identity, Butler draws on Esther Newton’s process of ‘drag’. Drag, Butler (1999:174) argues, mimics “both the expressive model of gender and the notion of a true gender identity”, which complicates the relation between ‘original’ and ‘imitation’. For example, Valocchi (2005) draws on Rupp and Taylor’s (2003) work on ‘Drag queens at the 801 Cabaret’, to build on sociology through a queer analysis. In the monolog on ‘drag queens’, the authors made observations of the participants who rejected and mocked “traditional femininity and heterosexuality”. For example, the drag queens combined femininity and masculinity in ways that 57  could not be described through the conventional categories, hence proposed “drag queerness” as an alternative category. Additionally, the erotic desire of the drag queens could not be subsumed under the rubric of either homosexuality or heterosexuality. For example, one of the participants in Rupp and Taylors study stated “I don’t know if it is because I wanted to be woman or because I was attracted to men that I preferred to be a woman…” (Valocchi, 2005:758). As such, Butler (1999) argues that although drag illustrates a unified picture of woman, it also demonstrates the gendered experience that is falsely naturalized through the regulatory fiction of the heterosexual coherence.   Additionally, a parody may not necessarily be subversive as there is a chance of reifying and replicating hegemonic norms, although it does challenge naturalised knowledge and the construction of reality (Butler, 1999). As such, subversion depends on the context whereby actors challenge cultural hegemonic norms, if it is not seen as transgressive then the parody itself might be rendered a part of hegemony (Nentwich et al, 2015). As the example above shows, although drag practices can be viewed as ‘troubling’, these parodic practices are part of the hegemonic power relations that restricts full opposition to heteronormativity (Lloyd, 1999). As homosexuality relies on heterosexuality these parodic practices operates from a system inside, not a position outside (Lloyd, 1999).   4.5.3 Imitation without a genesis Butler further draws on the psychoanalytic notion of gender identity that is constituted through ‘fantasy of a fantasy’ in explaining how there is no original identity in which gender parody, it is an imitation without a genesis (Butler, 1999:175). The gender identity is then an effect of the imitation itself, or more specifically, it is an imitation of the phantasmatic ideal of a naturalized heterosexual identity (Butler, 1993). Queer theorists thus locate heterosexuality itself as an unstable term (Stein and Plummer, 1996) whereby heterosexuality is no longer regarded as the ‘original’ of which homosexuality is a ‘copy’ (Callis, 2009) but rather a copy of a copy. Heterosexuality sets up itself as an original through the imitation of itself where the “reality” of heterosexual identities is always failing by attempting to naturalize itself as the original (Butler, 1993).  In this way, heterosexuality must be considered as an obligatory reiterative act that produces the effect of their own originality, whereas heteronormative identities, the ontologically phantasms of 58  “man” and “woman”, are theatrically constructed effects that posture as the “normative measure of the real” (Butler, 1993:313). The constructs of homosexual identities as a copy thus rely on heterosexuality as the ‘origin’. Butler (1993) therefore stresses the importance of locating how heteronormativity reappear within LGBTQIA identities, which illustrate the ways in which heterosexuality is constituted as the original through a set of convincing acts of repetitions that is compulsory and promotes punishment and violence through its restrictions. The naturalization of heterosexuality is thus constructed through an illusionary coherence between sex, gender and desire, although sexuality is not fully expressed through performance as there will, for example, be butchy femmes that might describe anatomically stable “females”. It is therefore the psychic identification that makes such categories unstable, which Butler argues is difficult to describe (Butler, 1993).   Importantly, and at the core of performativity, is speech acts which produces or brings into being what it names (Butler, 1996). Power is located in language, which is an act where the speaking subjects create the “socially real” (Butler, 1999). As such, coming out can be viewed as a performative act, as discussed in Section 3.4 of the preceding chapter. This is based on the work of linguistic philosopher Austin who developed on the idea of performance as a linguistic matter and suggested that “much of language consist of performative utterances”, whereby the words said have to be spoken in appropriate contexts in order to be viewed as ‘performative’ (Ward and Winstanley, 2005:452). Although Butler draws on Austin’s work, she rejects the view of a self-directed agent that creates the performative utterances and rather draws on Derrida in order to illustrate that performativity relies on repetition (Lloyd, 1999). However, it is the distinction between performance and performativity that have tended to be a site of confusion. Particularly in constructing the gendered subject as it is often mistaken to be voluntary, or a free act of will, which contradicts with Butler’s view that agency is located in the practices whereby the gendered subjects are produced (Lloyd, 1999).   4.5.4 Performance vs. performativity In an attempt to understand the ways in which identity is viewed in contemporary society, Lloyd (1999) examines some of the issues relating to Butler’s work, particularly Butler’s ambiguity of distinguishing performance from performativity, which has been misunderstood in some of the extant literature that takes on Butler’s work. In ‘Gender Trouble’, Butler asks “what kind of gender performance will enact and reveal the performativity of gender itself in a way that destabilizes the 59  naturalized categories of identity and desire” (1999:189). In ‘Bodies that Matter’, Butler attempts to separate between performance and performativity by arguing that performativity is the reiteration of norms that restricts the performer’s will and choice, while performance is a “bounded ‘act’” that seeks to conceal “what remains opaque, unconscious, unperformable” (1993:234). However, in the interview in Osborne and Segal (1994) named ‘Gender as performance’, Butler proposes a second way to distinguish between performance and performativity, whereas the former presumes a subject and performativity contests the subject.  Lloyd (1999:209) argues that it is difficult to distinguish performance from performativity of gender as both rely on “the recitation of the same norms and conventions”. While performance is often thought to be a free choice, it is according to Butler (1999:140), “effected with the strategic aim of maintaining gender within its binary frame”. Thus, a performance that aims to transgress gender binary will only ‘trouble’ if it is perceived as such. In this manner, agency is located in the subjectivation rather than being linked with the person (Nentwich et al, 2015). Performativity further constructs the subject through reiterative acts while at the same time reconstructing the social established order hence conflates the agency and structure dualism (Nentwich et al, 2015; Valocchi, 2005).   4.6 Critique of Queer theory and gaps in the literature Although queer theory recognizes multiple and intersecting identities, it often tends to reinforce a binary that places heterosexuality on one side and “everything queer” on the other side (Gamson and Moon, 2004:52) hence neglects and subsumes differences in terms of class, race and gender, but also other marginalized sexualities (Angelides, 2006). Black feminists intersectionality theory introduced the notion of “multiple identities” that are interconnected (Crenshaw, 1991) long before it was proposed by queer theory. However, queer theory incorporated sexuality to the discussion of difference by criticising identity-based analysis (Valocchi, 2005). For example, although the term ‘queer’ has been used to represent race and gender neutrality, this means the whiteness associated with queer theory goes unchallenged (Jeffreys, 1994). These positions are also supported by black queer theorists who have argued that the normalizing forces of whiteness is not taken into account in the critique of the universal norm of white queer subjects within heteronormativity (McDonald, 2015b). As such, Barnard (1999:200) argues that race should be seen as similar in instability to sexuality and criticises queer theory for neglecting queers of 60  colours’ experiences, hence proposes a theory of ‘queer race’ in order to understand that “sexuality is always racially marked”  rather than distinct axes.   However, having a sole focus on sex and sexuality, neglecting gender, queer theory is criticised for (re)producing not only whiteness, but also the non-heterosexual ‘male’ identity (Chevrette, 2013). As such, one of the critiques of queer theory is that, by introducing the analytic distinction between gender and sexuality, queer studies erases the experiences of lesbians and bisexual women by centring the gay ‘male’ subject as universal (Walters, 1996). While Rubin (1975; 1999) criticised feminism as a site for analysing sexuality, as they tended to conflate lesbians’ experiences under the rubric of ‘women’, queer theory is argued to be “feminist free” which results in homogenising women’s interests with those of men (Jeffreys, 1994). Using the example of ‘camp’, Jeffreys (1994) further argues that the term queer has been used solely to denote performative strategies that signify a ‘male’ body, which has become fundamental to the examination of queer identities. Further, Angelides (2006:151) argues that the separation of sexuality and gender are made even more problematic through an examination of bisexuality as an “important historical regulator of the axes of gender and sexuality”.   Whereas Butler’s (1999) ‘Gender Trouble’ demonstrates how lesbian identities deviating from ‘appropriate’ notions of femininity cause gender trouble, bisexuality is not mentioned in the discussions of the interconnectedness between gender and sexuality or in theorising performativity.  There is therefore a gap in the performativity literature on bisexual subject positions in gender and sexual formation, as for example, a bisexual woman that engages in sexual activity with both men and women cannot identify as ‘butch’ or ‘femme’ “without causing gender trouble” (Callis, 2009:228). As such, by separating sexuality from gender, Sedgwick and Rubin in particular, are criticised for rendering bisexuality incapable of revealing coherence and a relationship between sex, gender and sexuality (Feldman, 2009). It is therefore argued that while queer theory seeks to dismantle normative identity categories, the homosexual-heterosexual dichotomy is often left unchallenged (Burrill, 2009). The invisibility of bisexuality in sexuality scholarship is also made evident in Monro et al’s (2017) literature review where they concluded bisexuality needs to be given greater attention in future sexualities research.    Although the fluid nature of Butler’s theory has been celebrated, it is also argued that the denaturalization of essentialist views of gender and sexual identities has rendered “certain gender 61  expressions impossible” particularly trans* identities (Schep, 2012:869), which has also resulted in homogenous theorisation of trans* people (Hines, 2006). Schep (2012) further stresses the importance of locating the limits of performativity theory, as it has become commonly accepted, in order to identify who the theory marginalizes and excludes. This has been particularly argued to be the case of trans* and bisexual identities, which is beyond the inside/outside model of queer theory, mainstream sociology (Namaste, 1994) and lesbian and gay studies (Angelides, 2006).    McDonald (2015b) further argues that because a wide array of heterosexual practices also fall outside of normativity, it is necessary to critique the normalizing forces and heteronormativity beyond the ways it marginalizes lesbian and gay people, as already discussed in relation to bisexuality and trans* subjects. Furthermore, there are also methodological implications as Chevrette (2013) argues that although identifying as “a heterosexual researcher critiquing heteronormativity” is important within queer theory, it paradoxically (re)produces the normative language of a stable heterosexual identity. As such, she argues it is necessary to question and challenge the stabilization of identities such as heterosexual and queer as they are rendered into types, which has been the case within queer theory through its focus on gay and lesbian sexualities rather than dismantling the sexual system (Chevrette, 2013). This also poses issues with regards to the undertaking of queer theory where Walters (1996:842) argues that opposed to lesbian and gay studies, queer study “lets you off the identity hook” by arguing that heterosexuals also fall outside of heteronormative practices hence might claim queerness by feeling disaffection from the conventional definition of heterosexuality. Rumens et al (2019) thus stresses the importance of sensitising how heterosexuality is rendered unstable and fluid in the research process. These are methodological concerns that will be addressed in the subsequent chapter.   4.7 Conclusions The purpose of this chapter was to discuss the ways in which queer theory can be utilised in order to oppose heteronormativity as a normative force that renders sexualities stable and fixed. Queer theory is a vital step towards deconstructing the heteronormative society that, as discussed in the preceding chapters, has tended to require LGBTQIA people to assimilate into heterosexual forms of identities that continue to privilege heterosexual norms despite the legal and social changes in attitudes for LGBTQIA equality and inclusion. However, as heteronormative paradigms limit knowledge about sexualities and gendered subjects, particularly sexualities that do not subsume under heteronormative practices, it is vital to examine how LGBTQIA and heterosexuals negotiate 62  heteronormativity at work (Rumens, 2016a). By deconstructing heteronormative assumptions rooted within these terrains, queer theory does not only regard non-heterosexual subject positions as unstable and fluid, but also disrupts the ontology of heterosexuality that is to be viewed as manifold and performative (Rumens, 2016; Rumens et al, 2019).   Although queer theory was introduced to disrupt academic heteronormativity, or more specifically to ‘queer academia itself’ (Pullen et al, 2016:3), academic institutions tend to be unaffected by the disruptive powers associated with queer theory (Renn, 2010). The current research thus drew on Butler’s (1999) performativity theory to answer Ozturk and Rumen’s (2014) call for research that questions normative knowledge in higher education while disrupting the hetero-homosexual binary to enable queer identities and voices. Bisexuality, and other non-binary sexualities, are thus important subject positions that has tended to be excluded from performativity theory, as they are argued to exist outside/inside the linguistic possibility in relation to the heterosexual/homosexual dichotomy (Namaste, 1994). In order to account for the mentioned shortcomings of queer theory and the limited studies queering the academy, discussed in Chapter Two, the next chapter will present the research methodology used to examine how academics negotiate heteronormativity at work.   63  Chapter 5 Research methodology  5.1 Introduction  In the previous chapters it was found that, compared to other dimensions of identity, sexuality remains the least empirically researched phenomena of workplace diversity, particularly in business management and organization studies and in practice (Köllen, 2015). Whereas the limited studies that do exist have primary been concerned with gay men, research has to a lesser extent focused on lesbians, bisexual, trans*, queer and other ‘non-normative’ sexual and gendered voices (Levy and Johnson, 2011). The aim of the study is to:  Understand how academics navigate working life in a workplace where discourses around ‘heterosexuality’ are the implicit norm.   To inform this research, underpinned by a queer theoretical lens, the following research questions were devised:  ▪ What discursive arrangements constrain and enable the development of LGBTQIA and heterosexual identities in academia? ▪ What happens to LGBTQIA and heterosexual people whose sexual and gender performance violate normative genders and sexual discourses in academia? ▪ How do bisexuals, and non-binary sexualities understand their subjects in relation to the hetero/homo binary? In what way does this binary enable and constrain gendered and sexual subjectivities to be performatively enacted?  This chapter therefore seeks to design a methodology around the research questions and the objectives derived from the literature:  ● To understand the role sexuality plays in academics’ working lives ● To uncover the ways in which academics negotiate discourses of heteronormativity and how heteronormativity constructs sexualities deemed ‘normal’ ● To investigate the contextual factors contributing to workplace (in)equality encountered by LGBTQIA and heterosexual academics in UK Higher Education. ● To advance and apply queer theory’s performativity theory to understand how non-binary sexualities (bisexual, pan, queer) ‘trouble’ gender and sexuality as stable categories 64   This chapter starts with a discussion of the research philosophy guiding the current research, the research strategy deployed and the data generation process. The framework for data analysis is then discussed in relation to alternative analytical procedures followed by ethical considerations such as informed consent, anonymity, confidentiality and reflexivity.   5.2 Research philosophy Methods and methodology have been argued to be separate inquiries where the former refers to “techniques for gathering empirical evidence” and the latter is “the theory of knowledge and the interpretive framework that guides a particular research project” (Lather, 1992:87). In this manner, issues regarding methods are secondary to the philosophical paradigm, the worldview or beliefs, which guide the researcher in epistemological and ontological ways (Guba and Lincoln, 1994). Ontological considerations include the degree to which ‘reality’ is external or internal to the individual, the objective or subjective nature of ‘reality’ and whether the reality is part of the ‘mind’ or ‘out-there’ (Burrell and Morgan, 2005). In a similar realm, epistemological considerations include the knowledge regarding the different kinds of ‘beings’, whether the knowledge is scientific (natural), or derived from socially constructed frames (social) (Humphrey, 2011).   There are several methodological approaches to issues relating to ontology and epistemology and as Lather (1992:92) argues “how one views the methodological issue of objectivity/subjectivity depends upon one’s epistemological grounding, one’s philosophy of what it means to know”. As such, the ontological position of the researcher provides a basis for the development of an epistemological position that “defines the relationship between enquirer and known” but also what can be considered as knowledge and how we can make knowledge claims (Grant and Giddings, 2002:12). This will be discussed in this section as part of the reflexive process that guides this research in order to provide a rationale for choosing the post-structuralist philosophy. The ontological and epistemological views are further expressed in the design of methodology in terms of creating the modes of inquiry of “how we know the world or gain knowledge of it” (Denzin and Lincoln, 1994 in Grant and Giddings, 2002:12). Particularly, this chapter aims to follow Popoviciu et al’s (2006:401) advice that a post-structural inquiry should critique “social scientific methodological foundations” in order to ‘queer’ analytical categories associated with social sciences, which previously have been closed.  65  5.2.1 Positivism Positivist epistemology draws on the work by Durkheim (1982), Comte (1854) and Weber (1978) that ontologically argues for an objective ‘reality’ separate from the subjective minds of researchers whereby the information derived from the research corresponds with this external reality (Blatter and Haverland, 2012). As such, positivism is underpinned by an objectivist ontology where the researched phenomenon is captured by the researcher through a process of reasoning that will, eventually, facilitate, as close as possible, an approximation to some ‘truth’ that is distinct of the researcher (Honeychurch, 1996). Thus, objectivity was, and to a certain extent still is, thought to be maintained as a result of a ‘universal’ subject position where the positivist epistemology is thought to be capable of representing all other subject positions (Honeychurch, 1996). Positivism is thus rooted within a naturalistic approach to human behaviour, where for example ‘homosexuality’, would be assumed to be a ‘real’ category that is universally applicable (Ward and Wistanley, 2005). Not only does the positivist approach undermine a ‘real’ category of investigation, but it also assumes a ‘false certainty’ of a knowledgeable subject with a fixed and stable gender and sexuality (Green, 2007). However, the search for ‘truth’ is not compatible with a queer theoretical perspective as Butler (1999), drawing on post-structuralist claims, seeks to oppose these ‘defining’ institutions that render certain gender, or sexual expressions ‘true’ and others ‘false’.   5.2.2 Constructivism The constructivist paradigm believes meanings and understandings derive from social interactions within specific social locations (Lucas and Tan, 2013). As such, the aim is to “keep the conversation going” rather than searching for ultimate ‘truths’ (Devine, 2012:727). In contrast to the positivist epistemology, constructivism recognizes the subjective construction of meaning although it does not discard certain notions of objectivity (Baxter and Jack, 2008). However, constructivism understands reality to be a social construction whereas ‘truth’ is relative depending on a person’s perspective (Baxter and Jack, 2008). As such, reality does exist, however, in multiple constructions depending on the people that hold them (Lincoln and Lynham, 2011).   The constructivist paradigm has, however, been argued to not adequately advance action for marginalized groups (Creswell, 2003). While the social constructivist paradigm has been influential in the development of queer theory, particularly in challenging the essentialist notions of ‘homosexuality’, it has tended to be centred on the origin and the social meanings associated 66  with sexuality (Gamson, 1995). As such, Gamson argues that “it [constructivism] was often tied to a politics of the making of a homosexual minority” (Gamson, 1995:394), for example prevalent in ‘labelling theory’ (Plummer, 1981) and ‘homosexual role’ theory (McIntosh, 1968) rather than a genealogical inquiry of the homosexual/heterosexual binary. As such it does not seem to fit with the theoretical underpinning of this study, as constructivists hold on to a biological sex versus the social construction of gender (Motschenbacher and Stegu, 2013) rather than viewing gender and sexuality as ‘performative’ (Butler, 1993). As such, the limit of constructivism is rooted in the bodily life “where abjected or delegitimized bodies fail to count as bodies” (Butler, 1993:15). What is neglected here is the ‘performative’ dimension of the construction, the “forced reiteration of norms”, which is a post-structuralist move (Butler, 1993:94).   5.2.3 Post-structuralism  Rather than explaining reality, post-structuralists seeks to understand a reality that cannot be viewed as independent from the culture and knowledge systems that produces it (Sandu, 2011). The canonical thinkers of post-structuralism are Lacan (1966), Derrida (1998), Foucault (1979) and Butler (1999) all of who share an emphasis on deconstruction, although differently, to trouble the concept of an essentialist subject identity (Alcoff, 1995). In this manner, post-structuralists contend that the foundationalist underpinning of individuals as ‘autonomous’ agents must be deconstructed, which, according to Derrida refers “to an analysis which examines the production of truth” (cited in Namaste, 1994:221). Without seeking to create a new binary, this points post-structuralism in the opposite direction of a positivist epistemology as Alcoff (1995:442) argues that within a post-structuralist epistemology:  “The subject or self is never determined by biology in such a way that human history is predictable or even explainable, and there is no unlinear direction of a determinist arrow pointing from some fairly static, “natural” phenomena to human experience”.   The way ‘reality’ is constructed, however, is through language (Eteläpelto et al, 2013). Post-structuralism has therefore come to represent the ‘linguistic’ or ‘discursive’ turn (Lather, 1992; Davies and Davies, 2007). Instead of ‘reflecting’ a ‘real’ society, language produces meanings that further constructs realities that are multiple (Richardson and St. Pierre, 2005). As such, instead of believing in a ‘reality’ with underlying meanings waiting to be ‘revealed’ or ‘discovered’, post-structuralism argues for multiple social realities and meanings that are created by discourse 67  whereby it is the traces of discourses that “create reality” (Banta, 2012:382). Post-structuralists thus view subjectivities as historically and socially specific results of language rather than a result of a person’s individuality (Richardson and St. Pierre, 2005).  In this manner, post-structuralists refuse the search for what Derrida terms logos, ‘the truth’ concerning the object of study (Fox, 2003). Instead of taking categories as a vehicle for action, post-structuralism thus argues categories are discursive constructs that should be subject to deconstruction (Harris, 2001). Through deconstructive techniques it becomes evident that neither the ‘self’ nor discourses, “the socially and culturally constructed patterns of language”, are ‘fixed’ but change over time as the institutions that construct them change (Francis, 1999:383). Meanings are thus multiple and depend on the discourses available to different people in different times at different locations (Richardson and St. Pierre, 2005). As such, not only does a post-structuralist position reject epistemological absolutes (Popoviciu et al, 2006), it also rejects ontological certainty of a ‘core’ or ‘true’ self (Green, 2010; Butler, 1999). Drawing on Foucault, Butler (1993) argues that objects do not pre-exist the situation, but rather are a result of “truth effects” that are constituted within discourse. In this manner, ‘lesbians’, ‘gays’, ‘bisexuals’, ‘trans*’, ‘heterosexuals’, ‘men’ and ‘women’ identities, as in this study, are not ‘fixed’ subjects, but rather produced “as a nexus of contradictory subjectivities” in power relations that are shifting (Baxter, 2002:829).    Discourses are therefore political, even though they are subject to change over time, the available dominant discourses tend to serve the interests of hegemonic social groups (Grant and Giddings, 2002). In this manner, post-structuralists do not argue for the “end of representation” but rather “the end of pure essence” (Lather, 1993:675). Plummer (2005:365) therefore argues, “queer theory is really post-structuralism applied to sexualities and genders”. Nevertheless, Popoviciu et al (2006:400) has argued that while post-structuralism and queer theory is “developed at an abstract level”, they are not embedded in institutional sites such as workplaces or individual subjects’ lived experiences. This research sought to address this gap by examining the experiences of gendered and sexual subjectivities in UK academia. Similar to other organizational research concerning sexual and gender identity, this study follows from a processual ontology, meaning that subjectivities are always in a process of becoming (Butler, 1999; Riach et al, 2016). Thus rather than viewing subjectivities as a noun, this study views subjectivities as a verb that echoes Butler’s (1999) ontological premise of gender as performative (Riach et al, 2016). 68   5.3 Research strategy: qualitative research 5.3.1 Quantitative method Historically, the social sciences have been underpinned by an emphasis on quantification whereby mathematics is thought to be the “queen of sciences” (Guba and Lincoln, 1994:105). Quantitative research thus draws on positivist epistemology and objectivist ontology, as discussed in Section 5.2.1, which seeks to localize facts that can be measured (Lather, 1992). In this manner, quantitative methods include surveys or questionnaires where samples are thought to “produce knowledge that is representative of populations” (Lawson, 1995:454). It is thus argued that quantitative approaches to the study of sexuality and gender identities is restricted due to its inability to capture the complexities of fluid and ‘performative’ identities (Fotopoulou, 2012). Misgav (2016) thus argues that the limitations of quantitative research is particularly evident with regards to the aim of ‘quantifying’ subjects whose sexual and gendered identity elude the categories available in surveys or questionnaires.   5.3.2 Qualitative method Although there are disagreements regarding the extent to which qualitative and quantitative paradigms represent a ‘clean break’ from each other, post-structural theoretical insights discard the use of quantifiable, positivistic methods and underpinnings arguing that these methods tend to silence marginalized voices (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005). Lather (1992:90) also argues that the introduction to previously marginalized voices to qualitative research, in particular, has rendered positivism’s “dominance increasingly shaky”. It is further argued that qualitative approaches are more suitable when there is limited knowledge or empirical research on the phenomena under investigation (Hancock and Algozzine, 2006), which is the case of organizational studies concerning sexuality and gender identity.  Due to the ‘linguistic turn’ associated with the post-structuralist approach to social sciences that stresses the importance of language in the construction of knowledge (Lather, 1992), qualitative research in the form of interviews was deemed to be the most suitable strategy for this research to study sexuality and gendered subjects and subjectivities in UK academia. This is because quantitative research methods usually employ quantification to categories where the categorisation process involves making social relations and contexts fixed in order to “stabilize categories for analysis” (Lawson, 1995:453). Additionally, the categories used in quantitative research rely on 69  essentialist identities that do not allow for an examination of how subjectivities are (per)formed as they cannot be objectively observed and measured (Fotopoulou, 2012:26). Further, quantitative research neglects to challenge or trouble heterosexuality as a seemingly assumed default sexuality. For example, people who identify with the stable category of heterosexuality might have had same-sex experiences where the homogeneity of these categories in quantitative research does not allow for intra-category constructions to be uncovered (Motschenbacher and Stegu, 2013).  Qualitative methods is thus a suitable approach for social researchers seeking to examine and understand the ways in which meaning is constructed in people’s experiences, perceptions and interpretations (Hickson, 2016). There are several methods that fall under the rubric of ‘qualitative research’ including, but not restricted to, visual methods, interviews, participant observations, interpretive analysis, case studies, ethnography and participatory inquiry (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005). However, qualitative research is also being ‘queered’ in the way that qualitative research within a post-structuralist paradigm argues that ‘lived experiences’ cannot be captured through normative methods as it is also part of the text created by the researcher (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005). This is termed the ‘crisis of representation’, as the boundary between lived experiences and text is being increasingly ‘troubled’ (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005).  5.4 Data generation Following Riach et al (2016) this section will discuss ‘data generation’, which refers to the performative ‘nature’ of the research process rather than implying that data pre-exist the setting, which is underpinning the ‘normative’ term ‘data collection’ associated with social science. Data generation is a suitable term as the researcher is involved in the meaning making along with the research participants (Davies and Davies, 2007).    5.4.1 Snowball sampling Generating participants for a research has been argued to be a problematic inquiry when the study is with individuals, experiences or groups that are ‘hidden’ (Browne, 2005). Hard to reach samples thus includes, but not restricted to, people who may not wish to disclose their identities because of a stigmatised ‘label’ (Baltar and Brunet, 2012). In this manner, snowball sampling has been found to be a useful tool for qualitative researchers, particularly when a high degree of trust is needed to gain contact with ‘hard to reach’ populations (Baltar and Brunet, 2012). Snowball sampling is defined as “a chain-referral that accumulates data through existing social structures” starting with 70  a small sample that is extended by asking the individuals involved to recommend partaking in the study to others (Bhutta, 2012:59). As a consequence of the heteronormative society, the study of sexuality has been regarded as a sensitive topic as there are risks involved in transgressing heteronormative ideals or codes (Browne, 2005). It has therefore been found that access is one of the main challenges when researching sexualities (Browne, 2005).   While probability sampling is mostly common in quantitative methods, such as surveys, which allows for generalizations to be made about the research population, it is not a suitable strategy for research on sexual and gendered subjects and subjectivities as a priori categories do not pre-exist the interview. As such, this research undertook a theoretical sampling strategy to generate data, which draws on the construction of categories that emerge during the research and initial data analysis, rather than representing a population (Abrams, 2010; Charmaz, 2011). The current study sample consist of thirty participants recruited through networks and Twitter. Firstly, initial contact with two self-identified lesbian and one queer academic was gained through a supervisor’s contact, who found interest in this research and kindly agreed to help generate more participants to take part in the study. The two self-identified lesbian participants sent the information sheet (see Appendix One) through their university LGBT network. Further, Twitter was used to recruit participants whereby the researcher posed a ‘tweet’ calling for UK academics to participate in a study on sexuality and gender in academia. This countered one of the main difficulties with snowball sampling, namely that of making initial contact (Saunders et al, 2009). A total of sixteen participants were recruited through Twitter. This was found to be a very useful method to gain contact with academics across the UK to participate and the participants were further asked to invite people they thought might be interested in the study or share information at their university, if they felt comfortable doing so, which resulted in additional 11 participants.   5.4.2 Semi-structured interviews on sexuality and gender in the academy As post-structuralists argue that “language constructs that which is being investigated” (Lather, 1992:94), qualitative interviews are found to be a suitable approach for this research. This is because interviews allow for the variety of human experiences to be investigated by providing people with a voice (Kvale, 2006). As such, interviews, drawing on post-structuralist theoretical insights, are defined as “a social setting for the proliferation of polyphonic dialogues, in which there are many voices and discourses that cross each other simultaneously to produce knowledge about personal narratives and social life” (Benozzo et al, 2015:295). As structured interviews are 71  criticised for reproducing normative, modernistic assumptions while not being beneficial for capturing peoples’ experiences (King, 2004), semi-structured interviews were selected as a suitable approach. Semi-structured interviews offer a compromise between unstructured and structured interviews and allows the researcher to respond and further explore narratives as they emerge (Hickson, 2016). Thus, semi-structured interviews allow the researcher to ‘probe’ responses where the interviewees can build on, or explain their answers in their narratives (Saunders et al, 2009). Further, interviews within a post-structuralist approach seeks to unravel the ways in which power and knowledge is reinforced through categorizations and how the subjects are constructed through discourses by deconstructing its normativeness (Grant and Giddings, 2002). This is related to the aim of queer theory, as discussed in Chapter Four, which seeks to investigate “the naturalising narratives of compulsory heterosexuality” (Butler, 1999:146).   Informing the design of the semi-structured interview schedule, the current research was inspired by Riach et al’s (2016) “anti-narrative interviewing” approach. An anti-narrative approach to interviewing is a Butlerian informed methodology, drawing on Butler’s (1999) performativity theory, discussed in Section 4.5. This method allows for an understanding of how the narrating organizational ‘self’ can be viewed as a ‘performative’ process because the ‘self’ is narrated continually as the “struggle for recognition remains an ongoing process”, which the authors argues can be ‘undone’ (Riach et al, 2016:2078). This approach thus seeks to allow participants to reflect on the strains, negotiations and conflicts involved in becoming and sustaining organizational intelligibility “through the narration of seemingly coherent, recognizable selves” (Riach et al, 2016:2078). Although the resistance of essentialism is vital within a post-structuralist and queer paradigm, it is also important to take into account the ways in which categories such as ‘lesbian’, ‘gay’, ‘queer’, ‘man’, ‘woman’ becomes ‘real’ in particular contexts. As such, following Riach et al’s (2016:2078) anti-narrative interviews, the current study sought to disentangle the apparently intelligible narratives to reveal “the labour that goes into producing and maintaining them”. Thus, to avoid relying on a priori categories associated with quantitative questionnaires or surveys where respondents can locate themselves in ‘boxes’ that tend to (re)produce normative categories (Chevrette, 2013), the researcher did not have a priori knowledge regarding the participants sexualities or gender identities prior to the interview.   The interviews started with a discussion of the aim of the study as well as a discussion of their role in the academy, workplace responsibilities and expectations going into the academy. After 72  discussing the academic context in which the respondents work and navigate, we moved on to discuss sexuality and gender. The interviewees were asked how they identify and what those identifications mean to them. The current research employed a strategy calling for participants of all sexualities and genders in order to avoid the critique of some queer research of essentialising identities in the research process, for example believing lesbian women as having ‘female’ bodies (de Souza et al, 2016). As such, the discussions around gender and sexuality throughout the interviews, drawing on a post-structuralist paradigm, attempted to avoid believing that categories or subjectivities pre-exist the interview (Butler, 1993). The interview schedule can be found in Appendix Three.  Further, interviews are flexible and can be conducted in several ways including face-to-face, email or by phone/Skype (Hickson, 2016). Although telephone interviewing has been argued to limit the development of rapport due to the lack of face-to-face interaction, it is thought to allow for greater reductions in costs of travelling and enhance anonymity around ‘sensitive’ research subjects (Irvine et al, 2012). Particularly, Holt (2010:115) conducted telephone interviews that were analysed using discourse analysis and argued that it allowed her to analyse the data “at the level of text” as data generation was not ‘disturbed’ by ‘ethnographic’ information from the home or communities of the participants or their ‘selves’. However, face-to-face interactions can be achieved through Skype interviews, when, for example, opportunities to travel to participants are restricted. The majority of the interviews were conducted through Skype with two interviews conducted face-to-face. The interviews lasted between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours, with an average length at 59 minutes. The respondent profiles can be seen in Table 5.4 below.

Data analysis is not objective because the methods utilised are underpinned by epistemological, theoretical and ontological assumptions, but rather subjective and value laden (Mauthner and Doucet, 2003). As the current research methodology is not constructed around scientific principles or quantitative approaches and discards the positivist epistemology and its objective ontology, this research does not follow a deductive approach to data analysis per se (Saunders et al, 2009). However, an inductive approach is argued to include a set of methodological procedures that seek to systematically produce theory that is grounded in observation of the empirical world (Johnson, 2004). In this manner, Johnson (2004) argues that data generation and theory building within an inductive approach are interlinked hence more accessible and a more suitable approach to examine subjective capabilities of the phenomena in question.  However, as Saunders et al (2009) argue, many analytical procedures combine both inductive and deductive approaches to qualitative data analysis. This study is, in certain ways, a combination of inductive and deductive approaches, as while the theory guides the research, it does not aim to test a priori hypothesis or categories, as categories or subjectivities do not pre-exist the interview from a post-structuralist paradigm. Thus, in order to justify selecting discourse analysis as the tool to analyse the data collected, alternative analytical procedures are discussed in the next section.   5.5.1 Alternative analytical procedures Firstly, grounded theory analysis is, ideally, a mainly inductive approach. This method of analysis 75  is thought to be useful for studies seeking to “develop a well integrated set of concepts that provide a thorough theoretical explanation of social phenomena under study” (Corbin and Strauss, 1990:5). With a goal of generating theory, grounded theory also subsumes generalizability which “help us broaden the theory so that it is more generally applicable and has greater explanatory and predictive power” (Glaser and Strauss, 1967:24). However, due to the post-structuralist paradigm underpinning this study and queer theory as the theoretical framework that discards essentialist understandings and any coherent or ‘real’ experiences, grounded theory is not a suitable analytical approach for this research (Länsisalmi et al, 2004).   Additionally, conversation analysis (CA) has been used for examining “talk-in-interaction” (Heritage, 1984 in Holstein and Gubrium, 2011). However, there are certain drawbacks of CA in relation to the study of sexuality and gender within a post-structuralist paradigm as CA is a systematic analysis that seeks to examine social action, rather than language, a vital facet of post-structuralism (Samra-Fredericks, 2004). Additionally, conversation analysis is not useful for the understanding of ‘silence as a discourse’ as it tends to focus on what is audible or the ‘visible’ features of the interview recordings (Bischoping and Gazso, 2016). Further, conversation analysis is criticised for its lack of focus on the political and social facets of meaning making of the world (Kogan, 1998), which is a vital part of post-structuralism as the available dominant discourses tends to serve the interests of hegemonic social groups, which is political (Grant and Giddings, 2002).   Furthermore, template analysis has been used for a variety of studies adapting a wide range of epistemologies (King, 2004). Template analysis allows for the analysis of codes or categories that are listed based on themes that emerge from the data collection (Saunders et al, 2009). This approach combines both deductive and inductive approaches to analyse qualitative data thus relies on a priori codes and posteriori codes (Saunders et al, 2009; Sang and Sitko, 2014). However, according to King (2004:256), template analysis is not a suitable analytical procedure for studies examining discourses, as the “attaching of codes to segments of text” would limit the possibility for exploring diversities, multiple meanings and ambiguities of the ways to which language is being used to construct ‘reality’. As such, template analysis is not a suitable analytical procedure for this research as post-structuralists contend that it is necessary to take into account “a multiplicity of truths at one time” (Popoviciu et al, 2006:399) hence requires a more finely grained analysis (King, 2004). 76   5.5.2 Discourse analysis Deriving from feminist post-structuralist traditions (Butler, 1999), discourse theory (Foucault, 1979) and critical linguistics, discourse analysis (DA) focuses on the ways in which “language as a cultural tool mediates relationships of power and privilege in social interactions, institutions, and bodies of knowledge” (Rogers et al, 2005:367). In particular, this form of analysis is inspired by Foucault (1979), as discussed in-depth in Section 4.2.3, who argued that subjects and their language are constructed through cultural and historical systems of power-knowledge, which in practice is referred to as discourse. Rather than being merely a web of ‘things’ or intersections of words, discourses are “practices that systematically form the objects (and subjects) of which they speak” (Foucault, 1972:49). This then requires a shift in ontology where the people under investigation can be viewed as discursive phenomena whereas discourse analysis seeks to understand why and how they “are constructed in the way they are” (Hammersley, 2003:757). In particular, Foucault is concerned with the specification of particular discourses of social institutions that link the construction of ‘lived experiences’ with the discourses of subjectivities (Holstein and Gubrium, 2011). Queer theory is regarded as “an exercise in discourse analysis” that is concerned with the power of language and words (Motschenbacher and Stegu, 2013:519). Additionally, discourse analysis follows the post-structuralist position that language is not neutral or a reflection of a reality, but the site where reality is produced (Peterson, 2013). Discourse analysis was therefore thought to be a useful analytical tool for the current research.   Discourse analysis includes a number of approaches that seek to uncover the ways to which language is used “by individuals in specific social contexts” particularly how language constructs, (re)produces and troubles the social world instead of revealing the social world as a phenomena (Saunders et al, 2009:542). Rather than viewing the research ‘subject’ as a focus of analysis, as the case of positivist epistemologies, post-structuralists analyses “individuals as subjects of discourses” (Grant and Giddings, 2002:21). Thus rather than being a ‘cause’ of performance, gender and their subjectivities are discursive effects (Butler, 1999), which Foucault (1979) argued was the case of sexuality. However, it is not only the subjects of the research that are an effect of discourses, it also requires the researchers to reflexively understand themselves as a discursive effect (Grant and Giddings, 2002), which is discussed in Section 5.6.2.  Whereas critical discourse analysis is useful for the emancipatory purpose, it is argued to not align 77  with the Foucauldian epistemological understanding of discourse as he resisted any position of knowledge as ‘true’ (Bischoping and Gaszo, 2016). This is not to suggest that Foucauldian discourse analysis does not engage with an emancipatory agenda, as it is a vital part of the post-structuralist agenda to destruct ‘grand narratives’ as marginalizing and oppressive systems of power-knowledge (Baxter, 2002). In this manner, Baxter (2002:831) argues that a Foucauldian discourse analysis raises the voices of silenced, oppressed or minority groups where the interest is in the “free play of multiple voices within a discursive context” in order to deconstruct the discourses that seek a “will to truth” hence a “will to power” in particular contexts. With regards to the replacement of “will to truth” with “will to power”, Hook (2001:525-526) argues that a Foucauldian discourse analysis needs to investigate “what counts as knowledge”, and the various systems through which knowledge is qualified/disqualified (in particular the system of exclusion operating upon discourse)’. This system should be further traced to the ‘material conditions of possibility”, the multiple supports of institutions and the structures and practices that are embedded in the production of ‘truth’ (Hook, 2001:525-526). In this manner, academia can be thought to reveal social logics that are normative in the way that the design of universities specifies ways of understanding people and the “social landscape they occupy” (Holstein and Gubrium, 2011:344).  Following Riach et al (2016:2072) this research follows a Butlerian methodology underpinned by a ‘performative ontology’ that understands the subject to be an outcome, rather than an essence, of “a process of social recognition”. That is not to say that ‘reality’ is a simplistic effect of language, as this research views ‘sexuality’ and ‘gender’, within the post-structural paradigm as the “historically specific and ongoing constitutive practices of writing and inscription” (Gottweis, 1998:249). Thus, a Foucauldian discourse analysis (FDA) would seek to ask how the webs of discourse and power relations are constraining the becoming of subjectivities (Bischoping and Gaszo, 2016).   5.5.3 Willig’s Foucauldian Discourse analysis: presentation of findings  Once all of the interviews were transcribed, the initial analysis started. Although NVivo is a beneficial tool to find emerging nodes, I decided to do this manually by going through each transcribed interview several times looking for emerging ‘themes/discourses’ and patterns around participants’ constructions of sexuality and gender identity, academic culture and norms. The first round of the analysis thus focused on reading and re-reading the texts analysing how participants constructed sexuality and gender identity within (and outside) the academic context. Further, due 78  to the difficulty of finding a ‘perfect’ way to utilise discourse analysis, the current research findings were analysed using Willig’s (2013) ‘six step’ Foucauldian discourse analysis, which has also been employed in Zits et al (2014) study on trans* men’s friendships. However, although Willig (2013) outlines six steps to follow, these were analysed in relation to each other and viewed as interlinked rather than separate steps. The majority of the respondents self-identified as bisexual, queer and pansexual, and Willig’s (2013) Foucauldian discourse analysis was found to be a particularly useful tool to analyse how bisexuals, and non-binary sexualities understand their sexuality in relation to the hetero/homo binary.  1) Stage one of the FDA focused on the different ways in which participants’ ‘sexuality’ and ‘gender identity’ was constructed in the transcribed texts. In this stage all reference to ‘sexuality’ and ‘gender’ was highlighted while avoiding looking for only keywords such as ‘gay’, “straight”, ‘feminine’ or ‘masculine’, as implicit ways of constructing sexuality and gender needs to be included. As such, the ‘silence’ of the discursive object “can tell us a lot about the way in which the object is constructed” (Willig, 2013:385). Going back to the transcribed interviews, using the example of ‘bisexuality’, it was evident that several self-identifying straight, gay and lesbian participants avoided drawing upon ‘bisexuality’ to position themselves as subjects. For example when discussing her sexuality and attraction towards both men and women, Ida a self-identified lesbian woman argued that ‘I feel like it is helpful to, to be sort of, to say that you’re erm… gay or lesbian’. Here Ida constructs the discursive object (i.e. bisexuality or non-binary sexualities) as an invisible or unsayable sexuality, one that should not be spoken about. The first stage thus involves locating all text where the discursive objects are being constructed.  2) The second stage focuses on the various constructions of the discursive object(s), which is linked to broader discourses. Again, taking the example of bisexuality as the discursive object, ‘bisexuality’ was constructed as ‘invisible’ or ‘transitory’ in stage one. The construction of bisexuality as ‘invisible’ resonates with both binary discourse and heteronormative discourse whereby participants stressed that bisexuality ‘doesn’t exist’ as society expects people to choose either/or identifications such as gay/straight or man/woman. In this discourse, bisexuality was constructed as a transitory sexuality, as a step on the way, to become either straight or gay.  3) The third stage includes an examination of the contexts where the various discursive objects are being constructed in the text and why it is constructed in that way at that particular time. This 79  stage analyses the actions that can be done. Within the academic context, George a self-identified bisexual man argued his experience as a bisexual man in the academy was ‘easier’ compared to his gay brother who also worked in academia. George stated ‘bisexuality is… is… a hidden sexuality for many different reasons, it doesn’t have to be so open and often people assume er… you’re one way or the other based on what partner you have’. Here George may have drawn on invisibility discourse to allow him to navigate academia as ‘straight passing’ as he did ‘not feel safe to talk about it out there in the corridor’.  4) The fourth stage allows us to gain a clearer understanding of the various subject positions the discourses offer. Using the example of bisexuality in the invisibility discourse, an ‘assumed straight’ subject position emerged, which enables intelligibility in the academy as it is inextricably associated with being a ‘real’ woman/man providing privilege to straight passing ‘male’ academics while sexualising female passing academics. On the other hand, taking up an ‘assumed straight’ subject position renders bisexuality ‘unsayable’, tied to stage five, whereby monogamy, nuclear family and normative gender expressions are available practices. Paradoxically, the ‘assumed straight’ subject position constrains possibilities to subvert gender as a stable and biological category reproducing academic heteronormativity. As such, moving through the academy as ‘invisible’ or ‘radical’, depending on the contexts, bisexuals’ subjectivity is directly implicated.   5) This stage involved looking at what can be said and done by constructing sexuality and gender identities in a particular way. This stage allowed for an examination of how, for example, certain ‘heterosexual’ practices became intelligible in some discourses while unintelligible in others. On the other hand, expanding on the example from the previous stage, within the ‘invisible’ discourse, the ‘assumed straight’ bisexual academic was found to not be read as ‘queer enough’ to do queer research nor participate in academic LGBTQIA networks due to the intersection of ‘bisexuality’ and ‘femininity’ (re)producing practices such as monogamy, gender as stable and sexuality as binary. A limitation of these available practices is that, according to Willig (2013:388), practices tend to “reproduce the discourses that legitimate them”.  6) Stage six examines the consequences for the participants’ subjective experience. It includes an examination of the things that can be felt, thought and experienced by taking up various subject positions. Using the example of Eric, who self-identifies as a hetero-asexual man, the lack of sex-drive, a stereotypical hegemonic masculine trait, made him feel like less of a man. Additionally, 80  Schroedinger, a self-identified straight man, argued that identifying as “straight” made him feel like a ‘fairly normal man’, an intersection allowing him to navigate academia as a proper ‘business persona’.   The following chapters will discuss the findings derived from the current research on UK academics’ workplace experience negotiating sexuality and gender identity. Chapter Six presents the data answering objectives one to three, while Chapter Seven addresses objective four. The objectives can be found in Section 1.3.   5.6 Ethical considerations  Ethics has been defined as “the norms or standards of behaviour that guide moral choices about our behaviour and our relationships with others” (Saunders et al, 2009:184). Bearing this in mind, ethical issues were addressed at several levels starting with ethical approval from Heriot-Watt University in order to ensure that this research is complying with their ethical guidelines to prevent any potential harm to the participants of this study. Due to the ‘hidden population’ associated with this research, it is of significant importance and the moral obligation of the researcher to stress that the participants’ interest is the main concern (Faugier and Sargeant, 1997).   5.6.1 Informed consent, anonymity and confidentiality Firstly, prior to the data generation process, it is vital to get fully informed consent from the subjects participating in the study. Christians (2005) argues that two conditions is necessary in terms of respecting human freedom, firstly that people voluntarily agree to participate and secondly that full and honest information is presented to participants before participants agree to take part in the study. In addition to being informed about the stakes of participating in the research and opportunities to withdraw from the study at any point, the informed consent included information about the study, the importance of the study, how the information provided by participants will be used and disseminated and reassurance regarding confidentiality and anonymity (Wiles, 2013). The informed consent form can be found in Appendix Two.  As such, anonymity is defined as “the means through which the privacy and confidentiality of participants are maintained” (Doyle and Buckley, 2016:7). Confidentiality was assured by replacing participants’ names with pseudonyms in order to make sure the participants are protected from unwanted publicity (Christians, 2005). With the aim of involving participants in the research 81  process, they were encouraged to choose their own pseudonyms. In addition, the participants were provided with my work address, email and phone number and reassured that I was delighted to answer any enquires prior to the interview and after the interview for whatever reasons. The participants’ rights to privacy was also considered at every stage of this research, which is particularly important in research concerning sexuality and gender identity, as participants may not be ‘out’ in every aspect of their lives, such as in the workplace. Thus, information gained through the interviews mentioning the participants’ employers were further removed and replaced with ‘(Employer)’ in the transcribed interview material. Additionally, the informed consent, recordings, transcribed interview material and field notes etc. was safely stored in a locked drawer at home and electronically on a password protected disc drive. Additionally, following Riach et al’s (2016) reflexive ‘undoing’, it is required that all parties involved in the research should provide a reflexive account to demonstrate ethics of openness. This allowed the participants to ask the researcher questions in order to bridge any anxiety or unanswered assumptions or questions.   5.6.2 Validity The question regarding validity is also being ‘troubled’ by the ‘post-structural turn’ that questions and denies the possibility of any methods to achieve an ‘ultimate truth’ (Guba and Lincoln, 2005).  Although it might be argued that some methods are more useful for researching the construction of social realities than others, no single method, or collection of various methods, can lead to an ‘ultimate’ knowledge or ‘truth’ (Guba and Lincoln, 2005). However, although knowledge about the world does exists, these knowledge will always be multiple, historical and dependant on the various settings (Fox, 2003). Lather (1993:674) thus argues that the purpose of a post-structuralist paradigm is to “rupture validity as a regime of truth” that needs to “take the crisis of representation into account”. In this manner, ‘pure’ presence is disrupted, interrupted and transformed into multiple, partial, fluid and disruptive presences, which is a post-structural form of discourse theory signifying “textual revelation” (Guba and Lincoln, 2005:209). As such, Richardson and St. Pierre (2005:962) state that “writing is validated as a method of knowing”. From this point of view, ‘practice’ and ‘research’ are interrelated rather than separate practices where the researchers perspective is not privileged in any way, as researchers are part of the world they seek to translate and explore into reports (Fox, 2003). However, this requires additional ethical considerations.   5.6.3 Ethical issues in analysis In this manner, language cannot mirror or capture the world as Spivak explains that “word and 82  thing or thought never in fact become one” (In Richardson and St. Pierre, 2005:968). Thus, post-structuralist research is often criticised for objectifying the research subject, as their experiences and discourses are decentred and cannot guarantee its own truth, as the subject discourses are secondary to the analysis (Grant and Giddings, 2002). However, importantly, no privilege is provided to any particular epistemologies, as researchers are allowed to explore the richness of the generated data through the play of text on text in unending combinations (Fox, 2003). Richardson and St. Pierre (2005:961) thus suggests that, within a post-structuralist position, the “situational limitations of the knower” is recognized as knowing is local, partial and historical thus rather than claiming to know everything, it claims to know “something”.   5.7 Researcher reflexivity and positioning Guba and Lincoln (2005:183) refers to reflexivity as the “process of reflecting critically on the self as researcher, the human as instrument”. With regards to the latter, in a post-structuralist paradigm, researchers recognize themselves to be embedded in discourses in a similar way to the researched (Grant and Giddings, 2002). Researchers are therefore required to adapt a reflexive position to demonstrate as much awareness of being embedded in discourses as possible (Grant and Giddings, 2002). This is vital as both the interviewer and interviewees take up historically informed subjectivities developed before the interview and is further made sense of during the interview (Popoviciu et al, 2006). Interpretations made between the interviewer and interviewees are thus part of the ‘data’ generation (Olesen, 2011). Researchers therefore needs to be reflexively aware of the unrecognized elements of their background that might contribute to data production (Olesen, 2011).   Although post-structuralist writing and thinking is significantly reflexive of ‘self’ and their own self-development as ‘knowledge’ (Baxter, 2002), it is vital to understand how ‘self’ and the identities of the participants are shifting throughout the research. Assumptions should therefore not be made based on the social identities that is ascribed to the participants or the ‘self’ (McDonald, 2013). As such, the essentialist argument that, for example, women are more suitable to study women has been challenged. For example, Misgav (2016) argues that in queer research, the ‘external’ and ‘internal’ researcher binary does not necessarily work as it is not given that the relationship between the researcher and researched is facilitated through a ‘shared’ identity.   Rather than following an essentialist argument of the researchers subjectivities as ‘fixed’, 83  researcher reflexivity represents a vital element within a post-structural inquiry to social science as it requires the researcher to reflect on the multiple and fluid positions of ‘self’ during the research process and in various settings (Lincoln and Guba, 2005). Additionally, ‘queer’ research and ‘queer methodologies’ stress the importance of researchers to consider their research subjectivity and reject the ontological assumptions of a ‘true’ and ‘stable’ self throughout the course of the research (McDonald, 2013). For example, in an attempt to be reflexive in her interpersonal research inquiry, Foster (2008) self-identifies as a “heterosexual researcher critiquing heteronormativity” to deconstruct the privilege of heterosexuality. However, and perhaps implicitly, the statement above (re)produces, rather than deconstructs, heteronormativity by implying a ‘true’ and fixed ‘heterosexual’ subject position (Chevrette, 2013:179). Post-structuralist theoretical insights concerning the ‘quality in qualitative research’ and reflexivity requires us to interrogate the ‘self’ as multiple (Guba and Lincoln, 2005:210). The process of becoming ourselves must be questioned, as must the binaries that shape our identities in the field and through interactions with participants in terms of who we “become to them” (Guba and Lincoln, 2005:210).   The questions regarding disclosure of the researcher’s own sexuality to participants or in writing is ‘troubled’ by McDonald’s (2013) auto-ethnography of his sexuality during a study. Identifying as “straight” at the onset of the research and ‘gay’ at the end of the research, McDonald explores a vital aspect of queer theory, namely the fluid and unstable ‘nature’ of identities through what he terms ‘queer reflexivity’. In particular, he problematizes the ‘matching’ argument of embodied categories of difference with regards to “who can study who” by neglecting the essentialist categories prior to undertaking research, both himself as “straight” and participants as ‘gay’. In this manner, McDonald (2013) argues that these categories, and undertaking research based on ‘matching’ argument, masks differences and similarities whereby a queer lens allows us to rather question those assumptions and the usefulness of these categories. Additionally, Rooke (2009) argues that researchers undertaking queer theory as a theoretical framework should reject an ontology that presumes that the researchers ‘self’ is stable throughout the research project. The reflexive account of myself during the research process is explored further in the next section.   5.7.1 Providing a reflexive account of myself I am following McDonald’s (2013) theorisation of ‘queer reflexivity’ by not defining or limiting my identity to a category, but rather being reflexive about how the acts of disclosing or concealing aspects of my identity affects the research process, data generation and the power-knowledge 84  dynamic between researcher/researched. Firstly, as this section illustrates, I turn to theory to avoid categorising myself or locating myself in particular discourses. This is not in order to avoid providing an ‘account of myself’ (Butler, 2005), but rather because of the difficulties of positioning myself with regards to available categories, particularly due to the heteronormative society into which I was born and raised (Butler, 1999). As I have never had to provide an account of ‘myself’ and the ‘categorisations’ to which I ‘belong’, I find comfort in queer reflexivity of viewing my identity as relational rather than categorical and context dependent rather than predetermined (McDonald, 2013).   That is not to say that I entered the research field as “unmarked” by sexuality and gender, as institutions and the norms within the research setting makes my gender and sexuality visible, which is interpreted by participants (Bowring and Brewis, 2009). In particular, some participants read me in accordance with the ‘heterosexual matrix’ whereby I become intelligible through a stable sex (woman), gender (feminine) and sexuality (heterosexual) regardless of that being the case (Butler, 1999). I engage in practices to gain recognition, both within and outside the interview setting, which is a continuing process. However, in seeking to disrupt and resist treating homosexual/heterosexual categories as an “empirical fact” or essence about the participants or myself, I was reflexive and aware that although I have identified as “straight”, it is not a ‘given’ and ‘stable’ identification. This is because dominant discourses can be subverted and might render this ‘I’ of which ‘I’ provide an account to not fitting in to fixed and binary categories (Butler, 1999). It is, in particular, the examination of how academics negotiate sexuality and gender in relation to the dominant academic discourses, including heteronormativity, in ways that are deemed ‘normal’ (Rumens, 2016a) and how people performatively constitute gendered and sexual identities that subvert these hegemonic discourses that this research sought to unravel.   Drawing on Riach et al’s (2016:2071-2072) Butlerian-inspired ‘anti-narrative approach’ to interviewing, in particular the concept of ‘reflexive undoing’, the interview questions were designed to reveal “the labour required to produce and maintain semblances of subjective coherence in and through organizations”. For example, interviewees were asked to reflect on how they identify, if they have always identified as such, what those identifications mean to them and whether there were any norms they felt they had to comply with. I was reflexive about not relying on a priori categories before entering the interview setting, and as such allowed for a ‘reflexive space’ for participants to discuss the performative processes they undertake to negotiate their 85  identities in the academy. However, the questions opened up for discussions around the shared interests and/or identifications between the researcher/researched. For example, we discussed my interests for the study, our shared experiences navigating higher education as academics/PhD students etc. However, in one instance I was asked if I were interested in exposing academic heteronormativity as “a queer researcher too”. Although the participant did not intend to ‘fix’ me to a ‘queer’ identity, it allowed us to have a discussion on how we enter the interview setting with unconscious heteronormative assumptions. For example, by asking if I identify as ‘queer’ or when I ask the participants how they identify, this opens up the possibility for us to draw on heteronormative categories to identify and make ourselves recognizable. Thus, although I attempted to discard essentialist categories, I did replicate the heteronormative categories I sought to reject, which demonstrate the challenges adapting an anti-narrative approach.  5.8 Conclusions The aim of this chapter was to design a research methodology that takes into account the fluidity of gendered and sexual subjectivities in order to make sure research questions and objectives are being met. As queer theory is argued to be post-structuralism applied to gender and sexuality, it was thought to be the most useful paradigm guiding this study. Additionally, the current research designed a research methodology that discards positivist and quantitative methods, which tend to stabilize and fix identities rather than regarding them as fluid and performative. As such, qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted, inspired by Riach et al’s (2016) anti-narrative interviews, whereby the transcripts were analysed using Willig’s (2013) Foucauldian discourse analysis. The next chapter will discuss the findings derived from the current research on UK academics’ workplace experience negotiating sexuality and gender identity. Firstly, Chapter Six will present the findings concerned with objectives one to three, and Chapter Seven presents the findings addressing research objective four. The objectives can be found in Section 1.3.      86  Chapter 6 Queering UK’s (Hetero-male)academy  6.1 Introduction Having discussed the research methodology guiding this study, this chapter, in combination with Chapter Seven, presents the findings from this qualitative research the aim of which was to understand how academics navigate working life in a workplace where discourses around ‘heterosexuality’ are the implicit norm. Following Zitz et al’s (2014) research on trans* men’s friendships, the current research drew on Willig’s (2013) Foucauldian discourse analysis. This method was utilised to analyse discursive constructions of gender and sexuality, which seek to oppose UK academia as a defining institution rendering certain gender or sexual expressions ‘true’ and others’ false’. The analytical procedure included a thorough analysis of how participants constructed the discursive objects, ‘sexual identity’ and ‘gender identity’, without only looking for keywords such as ‘woman’, ‘bisexual’, ‘gay’, ‘man’, “straight” etc. Additionally, it requires an analysis of the subject positions participants take up in various contexts as well as how these subjects are situated within broader discourses such as femininity and masculinity etc. The six steps are presented in Section 5.5.3. Although this method was explained as six separate steps or stages, they are interrelated and were therefore analysed as such.   The findings discussed in this chapter addresses three of the research objectives first set out in Section 1.3, while Chapter Seven will focus on non-binary sexualities, in particular bisexuality, to answer the final objective. As such, Section 6.2 will discuss objective one, namely how participants constructed sexuality and gender identity as a private matter while providing an understanding of the tensions of bringing sexuality ‘to work’. Section 6.3 and 6.4 will further discuss how academics negotiate discourses of heteronormativity and how heteronormativity further constructs sexualities deemed ‘normal’ in order to address objective two. Further, Section 6.5 address objective three discussing the contextual factors inhibiting academics to bring sexuality to work. Participants were also asked what universities could do to challenge academic heteronormativity and become more inclusive, which is discussed in Section 6.6. The respondents’ profiles can be found in Table 5.4 of the previous chapter.   6.2 Constructing a private identity ‘with a sexuality’: queering essentialism This section seeks to discuss the process of recognition and construction of sexualities and gender positions by examining the available discourses and language used to construct themselves as ‘subjects’ inside and outside of the academic context. The discussion below also explores how 87  sexuality can challenge ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ as stable categories to understand the role sexuality plays in academic working lives. To start, only three of the participants, Tucker, Abigail and Schroedinger identified as “straight”. In all three narratives, their identification as “straight” meant that they had never questioned the gender ‘assigned’ at birth per se. It did not mean, however, that they had ‘ruled’ out the possibility of being attracted to the ‘opposite’ gender.   Furthermore, all of the participants had at one time identified as “straight” or ‘heterosexual’ when reflecting on the process of recognising their subjectivities. For example, Isabel, a self-identified lesbian woman, positioned herself in relation to ‘straightness’ before identifying as ‘lesbian’: ‘…I think you know, failed heterosexual confused, uh followed by lesbian’. Additionally, participants constructed their sexualities in relation to what they were ‘not’ as mentioned by Bianca, a self-identified gay woman: ‘I suppose, like in a deficit model, not heterosexual’. The aforementioned references to ‘normative’ language to position oneself shows the historical construction of ‘straightness’ as ‘normal’ that (re)produces ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ in society, which is further transmitted to workplaces. It further ensures that the heterosexual/homosexual binary remains intact to avoid any disturbance to heteronormativity, which seeks to create the oppositions between ‘heterosexuality’ and ‘everything else queer’ while creating a presumed ‘stable’ gender and sexuality. However, the difficulties associated with examining the discursive construction of gender without reference to sexuality was evident in the narrative by Charlotte, a self-identified bisexual trans woman, who stated that ‘For the first couple of decades I was fairly convinced that I was …. A straight man….just in massive denial’. However, before identifying as a bisexual trans woman, Charlotte went through a process of taking online gender tests, slowly started thinking about changing her name, and ‘cross-dressing’ which ‘it felt for everyone at the time’ before realising that she was not ‘bi-gender’ but ‘I actually am a woman’.   This discussion demonstrates the performativity of gender and sexuality where Charlotte positioned herself in relation to ‘straightness’ and this acted as a ‘starting point’ to discursively construct a sexuality. However, rather than being a ‘stable’ identity this narrative shows how identities are a process of becoming that is negotiated in relation to available discourses of knowledge that are normalised such as ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ and ‘cis-gender’. Additionally, by coming out as gay or asexual, self-identifying male academics in this study argued they were forced to perceive themselves to no longer be read as ‘men’. For example, Eric, who identified as a hetero-asexual man who has had ‘bisexual’ experiences in the past, reflected on the 88  tensions between identifying as ‘asexual’ and ‘heterosexual’ and the impact this ‘non-conformity’ to heteronorms has on his understanding of ‘maleness’ in the academic context. For example, ‘being’ hetero-asexual, Eric had questioned his gender, or belonging to the dominant discourse around ‘maleness’ as his lack of sex-drive meant that he did not fully identify as a ‘physiologically functional man’, which was reflected on in relation to a very heteronormative view of gender:   ‘Um, okay let’s start with physiologically I’m male, erm, I’m… although being vasectomised, I’m, er, shall we say not a, not a physiologically functional man and also with the desire for sex going… having gone out the window... I’m… yes, I’m not… I’m far from a fully functional man...because the biological function of males is to provide, erm, mixtures of X and Y chromosomes to, to fertilise, expand and promote the next round of a selfish gen, erm, that’s a purely… very biological function. erm, and I think moving from there to man, erm, I’m led to believe that men are meant to be, erm, dynamic, er, thrusting in very various ways and, erm, and I’m not that. erm, what I prefer to say is I am not an alpha…’ (Eric, self-identified hetero-asexual man)  In the narrative provided by Eric, it was clear that ‘maleness’ or ‘being a man’ was constructed in relation to reproduction, a view of gender and sexuality that is informed by heteronormativity Additionally, Eric constructed ‘man’ in relation to normative views of heterosexuality and sexual desire between man and woman, whereby he associated ‘proper’ relationships with women and casual sex with men. However, after his sex-drive waned, Eric positioned himself within the ‘hetero-asexual’ subject position by dis-identifying with ‘bisexuality’. It is also evident in the narrative that Eric’s identification with ‘heterosexuality’ in later years is a position he constructed as associated with ‘normalcy’ and privilege whereas ‘bisexuality’ or ‘gay’ was conflated with ‘paedophilia’ hence constructs non-normative sexualities as ‘deviant’ or ‘not one of us’. For example, Eric argued that heterosexuality was normative as heterosexuality had historically never been conflated with paedophilia:   ‘The world has an idea of being heterosexual, as men can only do certain stuff. Heterosexuality has not been confused with pedophile, which has been the case for homosexuals. However, when I was interested in ‘men’, it was men I was interested in, not children. It created a ‘not one of us’ barrier. This was associated with Thatcher. Left wing is much more about ‘all of us first’ that stresses equality of opportunity.’ (Eric, self-89  identified hetero-asexual man)  The discussions above demonstrates that previously stable identities such as ‘heterosexuality’ (Charlotte, Isabel, Bianca, Eric) are queered and rendered unstable. However, discussing the academic context, it was clear that the institutional power of academia constructs ‘true’ ideas of what ‘manhood’ should ‘look like’. As such, several of the self-identified gay men positioned themselves in relation to the hegemonic discourse of ‘manhood’ mentioned by Eric. The ‘male’ privilege was further referred to by several of the self-identified gay men, which were linked to ‘conformity’ of traditional masculinities and heterogender norms relating to ‘top/bottom’ positions. Barnaby, a self-identified gay man, reflected on norms of traditional masculinities both in South Africa, where he grew up, and in UK higher education:   ‘Um… so where masculinity it’s about limiting emotions, it’s about a… you have to be the butchy, successful, leader, powerful, strong, invincible kind of thing, and…. So they’re definitely there, and both, in South Africa and UK, there was also the… and I… in terms of sexual identities, I mean, I think in both places you get it around gay men’s struggle with this, and are complicit with this as well, with the kind of norms about what… top or bottom, you know, who, who’s more mascu… there’s the top is more masculine than the bottom, what the hell is that about? … And what it is about is the cultural norm of you know, ‘okay you’re not straight but at least you’re still a man!’ (Barnaby, self-identified gay man)  Whereas Barnaby argued that the cultural ‘norm’ provides men with privilege regardless of sexuality, Adam, argued that he did not ‘feel’ like a man, having experienced homophobia in the academy whereby straight men had told him that gay men are not ‘men’. Adam thus reflected on his own experiences of what ‘man’ means, which he further tied to research that he had read:  ‘Research shows again that when they say ‘men’, they mean straight men, they mean white men and able-bodied men and middle class men.’ (Adam, self-identified gay man)  This resulted in creating a damaging and false distinction between ‘real men’ and ‘gay men’ that further necessitated masculinities to be performed convincingly in relation to ‘straightness’.  Similarly, Anthony reflected on what identifying as a gay man meant to him. His discursive construction of gender and sexuality was negotiated in relation to the tensions between his own 90  internalisation of ‘maleness’ and societal expectations of ‘masculinity’.   ‘Masculinity is fragile, it’s performative and I, I behave consciously and subconsciously in ways to appear more masculine and manly.... … my masculinity has been sort of so… I can’t… the word’s on tip of my tongue but I can’t think of it so I’m going to use a word I don’t quite mean, it was imposed on me, internalised, because I internalised it so much I generally perform erm my role as man quite convincingly and erm people can be quite surprised when I come out. And so actually I think that’s when I erm notice it most is when… when that happens particularly with straight men and there’s that disconnect for them between erm so “oh alright you’re not like that” sort of thing.’ (Anthony, self-identified gay man)  Similarly to Adam, ‘coming out’ as a gay man in the academy, meant that Anthony might jeopardise  ‘passing’ and being ‘read’ as ‘man’ hence creating an ‘us – them’ distinction between what is stereotypically associated with ‘real men’ and anything that diverge from the ‘real’ meaning gay men and femininities. As seen in Table 5.4, participants’ academic disciplines varied from STEM, history, psychology to business management. However, several participants were familiar with queer theory and their pre-existing academic knowledge on sexuality and gender was reflected in Anthony, Adam and George’s discussions around self-identifications. Additionally, George argued that ‘coming out’ as bisexual would mean challenging traditional norms of (hetero)masculinity that are implicit in the academic context through which he navigates:  ‘Um yes! I’m yeah, I do… erm… particularly in terms of sexuality… I feel like the reason why I don’t mention my bisexuality is because er I feel the… I mean I am sure that I would be supported here but I feel the need to sort of conform in that traditional sense to just live up to the presumption that I am straight.’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  As such, rather than disrupting the heteronormative assumptions of a stable gender and sexuality ingrained in the academy, George ‘feels the need’ to ‘live up to the presumption that I am straight’. George, Adam, Eric and Anthony’s narratives shows how sense of belonging to the ‘male’ category hinges on being perceived “straight” and how straight males are privileged in that they do not have to question whether or not they will be viewed as less of ‘man’ by coming out. However, whereas Adam, Eric and Anthony constructed ‘maleness’ in relation to a ‘normal’ view of masculinity 91  associated with ‘straightness’, James, a self-identified gay man, argued that masculinities were multiple and performed differently in various contexts:  ‘Being a man means having a bit of a laugh about it, to be honest. erm, so, I think, I, I think my kind of group of gay male friends, we do kind of...  we do laugh quite a lot with each other about, you know, being manly or doing something. Yes, it’s...  probably have quite a camp approach to masculinity, I’d say. erm, but again, like, there’s such a large group of us, erm, that there’s a lot of variety, I suppose, in our...  in our masculinity. But again, like, in Manchester, you don’t need...  there’s such a huge variety of people.’ (James, self-identified gay man)  Having a ‘camp’ approach to masculinity allowed James to construct an identity that ‘diverges’ from the dominant heterosexual norm of ‘masculinity’, which was fluid and open to change. Although George was navigating academia as presumed straight, he argued that his gender was contextual in that it varied depending on who he was socialising with, which was ‘done’ within a heteronormative frame:   ‘As you know, looking at identities, it is different for different people, I mean… I go to rugby a lot with my dad, and when I am there I see myself, you know, as very manly in a sort of heteronormative way, very like masculine. When I watch my dad, you know, when I am out with my mates eh…. At a bar or somewhere, and we’re gossiping, it’s a little bit more… a little bit more towards eh what might be more feminine... I don’t know… I… I… kind of whip around a lot, I’m quite flexible…’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  Here George constructs masculinity as performative whereby he performs masculinity at stereotypically masculine ‘spaces’ such as when he is going to rugby, while doing femininities associated with gossiping at the bar with friends. As the discussions above shows, Anthony, Barnaby, Adam, Eric and George, identifying as gay, bisexual and hetero-asexual men, reflected on how they were performatively ‘doing’ gender in relation to the privilege of being ‘assigned male at birth’. However ‘doing ‘maleness’ was in tension with taking up a ‘sexual’ subject positions, as they felt identifying with non-straight categories meant questioning their belongingness to the dominant discourse of ‘maleness’. Gay, bisexual and hetero-asexual men hence had to negotiate their identities in relation to societal expectations of ‘manhood’ and 92  ‘masculinity’ to avoid being read as ‘other’ thus feminine.    Self-identified gay ‘male’ participants in this study tended to construct themselves as subjects in relation to normative, thus heterosexual constructs of ‘maleness’, while having the possibility to ‘redo’ their gender by occupying a ‘gay position’, often discussed in relation to homophobia. However, self-identified ‘female’ participants including Ida, Dorothy, Alice, Drew, Anna, Abby, Doris, Alex and Isabel constructed gender in relation to sexism and how this intersection made their bodies visible, hence they must be ‘women’.    A      I guess I identify as a woman but not particularly strongly.   Q     In what ways?   A [pause] I don’t know. I just, again... like, I consider myself a feminist and I’m aware that because other people perceive me as a woman I experience an awful lot of sexism, as a woman. But how important is my gender identity to me beyond that? Like, it’s not, erm. So, yeah. Beyond the sexism I experience and sort of like the things I can’t control about how other people interact with me, on a personal level I just don’t feel it’s that important a part of my identity. As a person. (Alex, self-identified bi/pan woman)  Here Alex argues that although she does not identify strongly as a woman, society reads her as such, which meant that ‘being’ a woman, for Alex, meant experiencing sexism. There were therefore evidently tensions between ‘biological’ and ‘societal’ expectations of ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ that results in dismantling sex and gender as stable categories, as many self-identified women, straight, bisexual, pan, queer and lesbian, reflexively ‘identified’ as women because society treats them as such;  ‘Not much to be honest, I never sort of wondered how to erm yeah, how to put any pink on, I guess what it means is that, I was sort of assigned female at birth and I don’t feel strongly, I don’t, I wouldn’t say I have a strong sense about gender but the fact that I get treated as, I suppose I… it means to me is that I get treated as a woman… gender do like, like being a woman is partly defined by gender oppression and gendered societal structures like… so I guess I like, I am a woman in that I am treated, so I don’t have a strong sense of I am a woman, that is sort of what I am as it were.’ (Anna, self-identified bisexual woman)  93  Rather than recognising the privilege of passing as cis-gender women, Anna and Alex reflects on how they are treated by being ‘read’ as women, which is tied to gender oppression and sexism. Drawing on a biological discourse, the female body is constructed as different from male, however, although being ‘assigned’ female at birth, Alex and Anna argues the biological body is not the defining aspect of ‘women’, but rather the societal constructed expectations. On the other hand, Caroline, a self-identified lesbian woman, reflected on what identifying as a lesbian meant to her, where she argued that it was a ‘freeing’ process in that she did not have to work for ‘men’s reassurance’ and avoid being objectified by men. However, Caroline also argued that being a ‘girly girl’ made it easier being an ‘out’ lesbian, as this might be seen by men as ‘doing’ gender:  ‘…You know, you’re like a girl that like a pretty lesbian, not like a short-haired, check-shirt- wearing, big rugby player then it’s a lot easier I think…that’s the sort of girl I date as well so it’s kind of the difference’ (Caroline, self-identified lesbian woman)  Although it was encouraging hearing that being out is liberating, Caroline adapted to heteronorms in constructing her gender and sexuality as viewed to be ‘conforming’ to a ‘heterosexual stereotype’. However, by being attracted to ‘femme girls’ it could be argued that Caroline challenge the patriarchy where feminine women are seen as ‘belonging to men’. For example, being visibly ‘lesbian’ was further constructed as someone stereotypically associated with ‘butch’ or masculine attire such as wearing check-shirts and having short hair, which was drawn upon in order to position their sexualities in relation to appropriate gender norms:   ‘… you know you’ve got the stereotype of the short hair or you know the very butch kind of lesbian which I am not which, but I’m also not, I mean as we know there are many different varieties but I don’t know if someone could yeah look at me and say ‘she’s lesbian’ or not if I’m not holding hands with my partner… erm… so I don’t, I don’t think that I project my sexuality… in, in like in the working environment at all … like I don’t think that I am you know sort of ‘in the closet’ but also I am not obviously gay’. (Ida, self-identified gay woman)  In this narrative, Ida constructed her identity in relation to visibility, where to be ‘obviously gay’ means complying with ‘butch’ norms, which meant that Ida did not ‘project’ her sexuality and could therefore not be read as ‘gay’ without holding hands with her girlfriend. The narratives above 94  show how participants reflexively downplay associations with ‘queerness’ in the academic context whereby sexuality becomes invisible and extracted from the academic identity. Furthermore, having discussed how the participants constructed themselves as subjects in relation to available categories both in the private realm and in the academy, the next section will move on to illustrate how the private realm was constructed as the place to perform queerness and challenge gender norms. Particularly as ‘queerness’ was perceived by participants as not welcomed and accepted in the academy, which is recognized as a heteronormative institution.    6.3 Ideal hetero(male) academic: negotiating heteronormativity to discursively construct a ‘normal’ academic subject position In combination with the discussed in Section 6.2, this section seeks to discuss the role sexuality plays in academics’ working lives and further discuss how academics negotiate heteronormativity in constructing sexualities deemed ‘normal’ in order to answer objectives one and two. However, this section goes further to discuss how embodiment, coming out, teaching, research interest and the public/private divide are examples of heteronormative forces that marshal academics ‘with a sexuality’ into a ‘queer friendly closet’ where certain ‘normative’ expressions of gender and sexuality is accepted. This includes coming out in a relationship, ‘passing as straight’ and doing research that does not diverge from the traditional research subjects that facilitate funding and grants. All of these practices are thus (re)produced in the academy to ensure heteronormativity is not challenged or weakened where the power of heterosexuality remains privileged and compulsory for academic validation.   6.3.1 Coming out as ‘normal’ academic: navigating the sexually ‘neutral’ academy Having discussed the discursive construction of gender and sexuality in Section 6.2, this section seeks to explain how the participants negotiated sexuality in academia where heterosexuality and cisnormativity remains an implicit norm in order to construct a ‘normal’ academic self. In the previous section it became evident that the participants drew on categories to discursively position themselves as having a sexuality in the ‘private’ sphere, however, occupying these categories at work, or coming out as ‘gay’, ‘lesbian’, ‘queer’ and ‘trans*’ at work proved to be a tough negotiation due to the heteronorms that are implicit in the academy. For example, George, a self-identified bisexual man positioned himself as a ‘bisexual man’ which was an identity belonging to the ‘private’ in order to ‘pass’ as straight in the academy:  95   ‘It’s [bisexuality] a big part of how I consider myself, but I don’t think it is a big part of how other people consider me… I have a lot of…. being a white ‘male’ in academia, means I can move through these spaces without sort of an assumption that, that maybe I am straight… I find that a lot of the other lecturers around me are lovely people, very welcoming, very open, er… but I find it hard to pass the distinction between private and public and I kind of keep it all business at work… I mean, every now and then we’ll talk about you know denying stuff like how was your weekend and stuff like that, but I don’t find anyone here that I can talk to about that.’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  In the quote by George, he constructs discussions around sexuality or ‘non-normative’ sexualities as belonging to the private realm whereby keeping it ‘all business at work’ is tied to silencing of non-straight identities. Although George argued that the university, and the department of education, was ‘open’ and ‘inclusive’, he later in the interview stressed the importance of talking about sexuality and gender issues in the academy. However, the privilege of passing as straight in the academy were in tension with identifying as bisexual in the private realm as he articulated not feeling safe at work:  ‘And I know that I don’t put that into practice, and potentially that is a little bit hypocritical of me to not feel safe to talk about it out there in the corridor…’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  As such, George’s voice and coming out process was restricted, as he did not feel safe to bring his sexuality to workplace discussions. The issue surrounding the private/public divide was referred to by several of the participants as something that restricted bringing sexuality and gender expressions to work. In other words, the separation between ‘private’ and ‘work’ identities were referred to as a distressing negotiation as academics are expected to leave queerness at home:  ‘Queer professors are very helpful to other academics and to academics that are coming out… erm that would make it feel more normal and more accepted. erm whereas I think this is much more kind of public/private divide, within academia the way you are expected to leave your person…. Personal things at home, the part that is being seen as queerness, isn’t just a struggle, it is a political struggle if anything. That should… that has got a place at 96  work.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  The narratives above illustrate the tensions between occupying ‘non straight’ categories and subject positions at work as Alice and George argued that private or personal information is constructed as ‘not welcomed’ in the academy, rendering ‘coming out’ a difficult process. As such, in order to fully appreciate the tensions involved in this construction of an ‘academic with a non-normative sexuality’, participants were encouraged to discuss the extent to which sexuality and gender influenced their academic identity, but also to reflexively identify the norms to which they felt they had to conform to and/or the process of non-conformity. This will be discussed in this section to illustrate how the academics were reflexively doing and undoing the normative conditions of which sexuality depends, in relation to the ‘ideal’ ‘heterosexual, white, male’ academic norm. Again, using an example from George, he reflected on the decision of not coming out as bisexual and ‘passing’ as straight as something that provided him with advantage in the academy, and particular in the education department:  ‘I openly don’t discuss or display as much as I potentially would like to… I feel that for a career in academia, it is potentially to my advantage to not be so openly bisexual. And that is horrible, because as I said I do consider it to be a large part of who I am and I… am very open with it in most parts of my life, it is just this part of my life as an academic as someone who would like to advance a career, it’s… it’s the only part of my life where I am not overtly open about it.’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  In this manner, George argued that coming out as bisexual would mean restricted career opportunities, and as such remained closeted at work. It was therefore evident that participants navigated academia through heteronormative interactions that rely on ‘normative’ behaviour to control that heteronormativity remains undisrupted. As such, academics constructed ‘coming out’ and explaining their sexuality and gender identity at work as a ‘second job’. The ‘need’ to comply with restrictive language that allows academics to navigate workplaces without being ‘visibly queer’ was particularly evident in Ash’s reflections on navigating STEMM as a queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer:  ‘The, the demand for, or at least my perception there might be a demand for education erm… makes me feel as though I’d be putting myself in a position of much more vulnerability or 97  much more emotional intimacy with people by actually just talking my life in the same terms that they talk about theirs…’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  By ‘coming out’, participants reflexively decided on what aspects to ‘disclose’ and metaphorically ‘bring to work’ and other identity factors that were ‘left at home’. This process was further negotiated through ‘acceptance’. The discursive construct of ‘acceptance’ to bring sexuality to work was found to be regulated by appropriate gender norms, relationships that mirror heterosexual coupledom such as marriage, monogamy and families. In this manner, ‘coming out’ was a selective and performative process whereby participants constructed subjectivities in relation to what is ‘normal’ and ‘acceptable’. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the three “straight” participants were the only participants to not reflect on the processes of ‘coming out’ and had never had any issues with being ‘assumed straight’. However, ‘passing as straight’ and being ‘assumed straight’ are two separate discourses whereby the latter was found to not leave space for queer voices to ‘come out’ without drawing on heteronormative language to avoid having to educate others:  ‘Having moved in the last few months from one university to another and having a whole new set of colleagues, you know, they’ll ask you questions like whether you’re married and have kids and things like that and, you know, I don’t have kids but I can talk about being married but just, I know that the second I say, like, I have my husband that they have made that assumption that I’m straight.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman)  While Drew argued she was read as “straight” because of being in a relationship with a man, Ash, a self-identified queer genderqueer, found they passed as straight due to being ‘read’ as cisgender by default, which again restricts opportunities to perform queerness:  ‘I think my sexuality… is accepted, I think as far as I need to have a fight it would be about people assuming that I am straight because they are assuming that I am a cis woman rather than anything that isn’t strongly influenced by… what they think of my gender.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  Similarly, Barnaby was assumed straight by disclosing his marital status to fellow academic colleagues in the psychology department, as it was implied that everyone in the academy fits into 98  the heterosexual mould hence reinforces academia as an implicitly ‘sexually neutral sphere’:  ‘Um… or… you know, “so I’m married”, “oh what does your wife do”, “no, it’s my husband”, “oh, I would never have guessed”, it’s like… ‘the problem is that you’ve guessed, you didn’t bother guessing, you didn’t even have the decency consider all range of possibilities, you just assumed!’ …  so that happens, and nobody takes it seriously, not nobody takes it seriously, it’s certainly not done in a way that is, that feels worth reporting and who would you report it to? And you would just be told that it was a mistake, you’re being overtly sensitive but at the same time it’s an annoying part, especially within academia were we’re supposed to be leaders in thinking erm and clearly that does not always happen.’ (Barnaby, self-identified gay man)  In Barnaby’s narrative, it is argued that academics are assumed straight by default and by saying ‘you didn’t even have the decency to consider all range of possibilities’ demonstrate how academia is assumed a sexually neutral sphere where ‘straightness’ is tied to a normative academic subject position. However, participants argued that interactions with both students and fellow academics were facilitated through ‘normative’ relationships that people could relate to. For example, people who were in relationships found it easier to discuss their private life at work and ‘bring their sexuality’ to the discussion compared to single academics. This was reflected upon by Anthony, a self-identified gay man engaged to be married:  ‘Erm I think erm it’s very easy when… a couple of… my soon to be husband, I’ve been with him all my work career as an academic erm so I started dating him when I was doing my master’s. I think because of my, I’ve got a partner a long-term partner erm it is a lot easier. So erm it’s an everyday easy way to come out. I think erm because otherwise that wouldn’t necessarily come up in conversation. So erm, I think because of that erm it’s fairly easy and I don’t really have experience of what it’s like erm without a long-term partner, so yeah.’ (Anthony, self-identified gay man)  As such, coming out with a long-term partner in the social work department made socialisation and interactions compared to being single. However, the intersection of being read as a ‘woman’ and being single was also referred to by Dorothy as something that hindered socialisation and acceptance in the department of nursing and social work, as colleagues could not relate to the 99  unacceptable norm of ‘being a single woman’:  ‘So I did quite a bit of online dating and stuff and I think people found that easier to cope with, knowing that I was doing what normally people would do, which is try to find a partner even if I hadn’t got one… but I think the idea of not actually wanting a partner erm… I think people, some people did find that tricky… and also it’s quite difficult to come out erm if you don’t have a partner, you can’t use partnership type terms, so… in some ways I was using the fact that I was doing this kind of research as a way of coming out.’ (Dorothy, self-identified gender-neutral lesbian)  Similarly, Kaitlin argued that her private life and sexuality was not brought up in interactions with academic colleagues in the history department unless someone she used to date was brought up to the discussion, leaving her to navigate academia assumed “straight”. Additionally, Adam, who works in the psychology department, argued that LGBTQIA dating life was generally silenced at work. Whereas straight academic men could socialise and talk about dating students, relationships falling outside of the ‘heteronormative rules of dating’ was silenced and further excluded:  ‘I think a lot of erm… caution around academics dating because men, and particularly straight men, take advantage about that and dating female students or worse and … what I have noticed is that… I am a single, gay man and 27 so I am relatively young to lecturing… and… I want to have a dating life, not with students of course, but… so it is normal, it very common for gay men to have Grindr or gaydar… and I thought for such a long time that ‘oh my gosh’, you know, ‘I am going to have to leave (Grindr and gaydar) now that I am lecturing, what if somebody finds out? ...and I had to try to rationalise that ‘no, lecturers are allowed to date and that there is nothing wrong with gay academics having profiles or having Grindr’… but I really felt for such a long time that, you know, that it was something to be ashamed of… I guess… there is sort of internalized homophobia where I thought that having a gay dating life or gay sex life was somehow shameful and that, you know, if students found out that would be really embarrassing. But I know that, I don’t (think) a heterosexual, single person at my age would have felt that quite as much…’ (Adam, self-identified gay man)  In this narrative, Adam argued that dating life among gay men in the academy was internalised as something ‘shameful’, as it diverges from the heteronormative topic of socialisation whereby 100  straight men talk about dating ‘female’ students. Unfortunately, Adam thus argued that he felt obliged to leave dating sites such as Grindr ‘now that I’m lecturing’, as he felt gay dating was in tension with academic professionalism. Additionally, the ‘normal’ conversation among the ‘gentleman’s club’ of rating the attractiveness of ‘female’ students and dating students was also stressed by George as a topic that restricted socialisation and space to ‘break the silence’ by coming out as ‘bisexual’:  ‘Sometimes they talk about…. [sights]… some of the students as well… you know…. How attractive they think the students are sometimes, which you know, I… I… don’t… it’s a very horrible thing to have to engage with, that conversation, or to have that kind of conversation forced upon you, so I often try to change the subject when they raise that. But every now and then, they might say ‘have you seen so, and so student?’, or ‘have you seen this person?’, or ‘do you know this person and are they attractive?’ in more cross terms, and… yeah… I mean, those discussions happen a bit, which is upsetting…’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  Adam and George’s narratives on the normalcy of male academics dating female students demonstrates how heterosexuality is (re)produced in the academy as natural and compulsory. However, George’s narrative also demonstrates the forced heterosexist exchanges during socialisation with straight male academics within the school of psychology. As such, it was evident that socialisation and opportunities to ‘come out’ as an academic with a ‘non-normative’ sexuality was restricted by ‘normative’ relationships that derived from heterosexual rules of ‘compulsory’ heterosexuality. In this manner, this research demonstrate that academics not complying with the ‘rules’ of heterosexual dating were punished by being excluded from informal socialisation and interaction.   On the other hand, Isabel, a self-identified lesbian woman, argued that although she was completely ‘out’ in the academic department of ‘women’s health’ she attempted to not talk about her private life too much and thought there should be boundaries between work and home. While reflecting on the extent to which she could talk about her private life in the academy, she argued that heteronormative conversations could result in excluding people that did not mirror heterosexual relationships from socialising. Although several participants argued their university were inclusive in inviting partners and kids to work events, it was evident that only ‘certain’ relationships were welcome. Having experienced silencing of her polygamous relationships, Kaitlin argued that 101  academia forces certain norms around ‘acceptable’ relationships ‘on you’ that are informed by heteronormative ideals. However, having recently moved job she had difficulties sharing this information without having heteronorms around ‘compulsory monogamy’ imposed on her:  ‘…it was made quite more upsetting for me by… the fact that I didn’t really have anyone to talk to about it, partly because I was in the situation that I was in, it was sort of very short-term contract with a lot of people that I don’t know… a lot of people were just like well you know that’s the way it is, people are sort of naturally wanting to be monogamous and so on [laughs].’ (Kaitlin, self-identified bisexual woman)  The quote by Kailin demonstrates the difficulties with short-term contracts for non-straight academics as she had to constantly come out in order to challenge heteronormativity. Kaitlin’s quote also illustrates how the normalcy of monogamy restricts the language to talk about polygamy and creating friends in the academy. Similarly, Grace, a self-identified bisexual woman, also stated that she was very private about her life at work. Like Kaitlin, having recently moved jobs, Grace felt she had to explain the relationships in her life using language other academic colleagues in the health sciences department could understand, which restricted socialisation:  ‘Um… so for example I was explaining to people, you know, how I, how my daughter has a donor dad et cetera…  but, and I’m very, very occasioned in my reference to my partner, but very rarely, partly because I’ve found partner unsatisfactory term, because that doesn’t really describe who he is in my life either…  erm and there isn’t a word to describe him and who he is in my life without going into great detail… so erm I tend just not to talk about him [laughs].’ (Grace, self-identified bisexual woman)  Similarly, Katie argued that she kept private about her personal life, as she did not feel she had a community around her to discuss issues around sexuality and gender due to the perceived lack of understanding among straight academics:  ‘So I don’t really talk about my personal life, no one really knows anything erm but, it may also just be a product of the fact that I wouldn’t really consider anyone in my office to be like a friend, I haven’t… I don’t really have a lot in common with the people around me, there’s a couple of people who do…’ (Katie, self-identified gay woman) 102   The narratives provided by Ash, Katie, Grace and Kaitlin illustrates how heteronormativity continue to organise sexualities in a hierarchy where certain relationships, sexualities, gender performances and even subject positions are viewed as more acceptable than others, creating a distinction between ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ academics. This section shows only some academics are allowed to talk about their private lives at work, leaving academic heteronormativity, cisnormativity and homonormativity intact and unchallenged. Thus, the ‘private sphere’ is constructed as a place where queerness can be performed thereby causing barriers to ‘bring queerness to work’. As such, heteronormative forces are in place to marshal academics ‘with a sexuality’ into a ‘queer friendly closet’ where certain ‘normative’ expressions of gender and sexuality is accepted such as coming out in a monogamous relationship.   6.3.2 Embodiment  In addition to the heteronormative necessity of ‘coming out’, participants were also negotiating ‘appropriate’ demeanour that aligns with heterosexual norms to avoid being read as ‘unintelligible’ academics. This part of the analysis aims to explore how participants construct themselves as academics and position themselves in relation to the norms associated with ‘academic professionalism’. It was clear from the analysis that participants drew on discourses such as traditional masculinities and femininities in order to construct an ‘academic self’, which were informed by heteronormativity. Several participants felt they had to conform to masculine ideals, as femininity made the academic ‘body’ visible. For example, Alice, a self-identified bisexual woman argued the straight, white male academics in top academic positions tended to (re)produce a ‘strict’ heteronormative ideal that academics had to negotiate. The doing and undoing of the aforementioned academic ‘ideal’ was further highlighted by Adam:  ‘… I am sure when I was younger we had this idea of what a professor should be or what you know, what God should be, if you’re Christian. White man, with a beard, whose a bit funny-duddy, straight, and… sometimes you’re like… you know… and popular culture, he’s a straight guy, like he might have an affair or …  he’s like a sexy guy…’ (Adam, self-identified gay man)  As such, participants reflected on how academia is (re)producing ‘male privilege’ by positioning men in power to create appropriate knowledge as to what an academic should ‘do’, dress, behave, 103  and look like. For example, Tucker, a self-identified straight man, argued that being a straight man provided him with significant power in the academy that ‘others don’t have’. Academics were, therefore, found to navigate workplaces created and maintained by the power held by men in authority seeking to (re)produce, rather than dismantle heteronormativity. In this manner, the ‘normal academic’ or ‘ideal academic’ was thought to be a straight, white, able-bodied, research active, masculine man. Anything diverging from this ‘ideal’ were referred to as the ideal academics’ ‘other’, constructing femininities as belonging to women and LGBTQIA academics, hence masculinities as belonging to the ‘ideal’ academic suggesting masculinity is of higher value than femininity:  ‘… yeah, so there’s kind of expectations around sports, what you’re interested in. I, I really, I really struggle with this idea that as a man you are not supposed to be certain things so I think one, one of the issues for me that, that, not so much anymore, but certainly if, if you, if people, if other straight men become aware that you’re gay they make a number of assumptions, that you’re somehow feminine, or with the normative assumptions that femininity is somehow less than masculinity...’ (Brian, self-identified gay man)  Brian’s narrative shows the power and privilege associated with ‘masculinity’ as a restrictive ‘ideal’. In this manner, navigating academia’s heterogender working culture does not leave room to ‘bring sexuality’ or any performance of ‘queerness’ to work, which resulted in forcing academics to ‘pass as straight’, a subject position equating ‘privilege’. In constructing an identity that was ‘passable’ as straight in the academy, academics often discussed their identities in relation to dress, behaviour and how to ‘look the part’ as academics. There was a feeling among the participants that there were no room to ‘perform’ queerness at work, reinforcing the ‘normality’ of academic ‘straightness’:  ‘…I feel there is a lot of assumptions about who I am… as a person that come with that… eh… masculinity is… I often find it toxic both for female and for males and it sort of has this, expectations about how you should perform and… and… tied into aggressiveness and push at work and erm… being knowledgeable…I mean… so for example, when I were, I am new here in this position and sometimes I find it hard to ask for help and… I see that potentially tied into erm… masculinity, tied into my, my hang-ups with my own masculinity, feeling that I should know what I am doing or I should be aware of what I should be doing… I mean, as 104  much as I try to be flexible and as much as I try to… obscure the normative behaviour I still, I still fall into it, and I am still subject to other people’s expectations as to how I should act and interact and perform gender so… I find it something that I struggle with.’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  The narrative presented above shows George’s construction of gendered expectations for men in order to ‘pass’ as men in the academy such as being aggressive, knowledgeable and not asking for help, which restricts alternative constructs of masculinities. The ‘normativity’ of ‘passing’ as straight in the academy was also reflected on by Brian, and several of the participants, which meant that significant work was going into maintaining a ‘normal academic’ position without a ‘visible’ sexuality:   ‘I mean, I mean again this, this is quite an interesting issue is that erm a lot of people can pass as heterosexual... without having to do too much, again that is a very interesting idea that assumptions are made about people by their demeanour or how they dress et cetera… I’ve never felt that I had to change anything overtly… just that I knew that I couldn’t talk about certain things.’ (Brian, self-identified gay man)  Additionally, Dorothy, a self-identified lesbian who identified as ‘gender neutral’ were negotiating their identity in relation to the heterogendered norms set by the academy. Whereas they would normally wear trousers and a shirt that were ‘not too butch, but not too femme either’ as they did not want to ‘look like a bloke’, they felt they were performing and adapting their identity in relation to the ‘norm’ to be read as ‘intelligible’ and ‘approachable’.   ‘Um… like you know, if you don’t wear the right sort of things… people look at you weird… so all the time I’m thinking about what clothes that I can wear that will make it more or less acceptable for people erm and make it easier for them to cope with me being a bit indeterminate. So, I mean, I’ve chose this shirt which has got sort of flowery pattern on specifically today because I was presenting a poster on sexual minority women at this conference, and I thought that if I wore something a bit more ‘girlie’, I thought people would probably approach me a bit more, erm, more likely to do that. So erm, and it worked actually, I got, I got quite a lot of people interacting with me which is really good.’ (Dorothy, self-identified gender-neutral lesbian)  105   The narrative presented by Dorothy demonstrates the tensions and work going in to construct an intelligible academic position as they would normally wear ‘clothes that very masculine women wear’. However, in order to be ‘approachable’, Dorothy decided to go with more ‘stereotypically’ girly attire, which echoes George’s narrative on academic gendered assumptions being ‘toxic’ for both men and women. Further, Adam argued that throughout school he reflexively engaged in practices to avoid ‘doing’ norms associated with femininity to avoid homophobia by adopting more stereotypically ‘masculine’ norms to be read as a “straight” man. Identifying as ‘an out camp man’, Adam positioned himself in relation to ‘femininity’, which he constructed as associated with women further constructing masculinity as belonging to ‘straight men’:   ‘I…. I lowered my voice, I use my hand gestures less, I’d wear neutral clothes, more masculine clothes, I’d be very reflexive about that, if I knew that people read me as a effeminate gay man, despite me being in the closet, so I try to do anything to mitigate that… and… and conform to more heterosexual, hegemonic masculine guy… like… even when… like overly masculine clothes like, I have this aviator jacket… and… you know… I stay away from anything feminine… pink, of course, I could never wear… brands that were seen as for women… so… I definitely do that to be read as a straight man, in order to avoid homophobia.’ (Adam, self-identified gay man)  The discussion above illustrate how participants negotiated discourses around ‘femininity’ and ‘masculinity’, whereby ‘femininity’ was constructed as ‘other’ and an ‘unintelligible’ discourse in relation to ‘masculinity’ which remains the privileged position. As such, femininity was associated with women and gay men, while masculinity remains privileged and associated with straight men. As seen in Section 6.2, Alice, Alex, Drew and Katie positioned themselves as women because they were treated as such, which was a subject position tied with sexism. In discussing their experiences at work, Ida, Chloe and Isabel argued that ‘being’ a woman in the academy meant that they had to work harder than ‘male’ colleagues and straight women. Additionally, self-identified women constructed themselves as women in the academy by adapting to more appropriate linguistic practices that did not overshadow more senior ‘male’ academics’ voices. For example, Abigail found herself ‘speaking differently to male academics, more senior male academics’ whereas Ida, working in the business management department of her university, negotiated the academic patriarchy by adapting a ‘people pleaser’ approach in relation to societal expectations of how 106  women should behave, speak and act:   ‘Um… I think the main way that I conform to, to gender norms is being … er like a people pleaser … so in interactions with others  ….I feel like I have to be smiling and pleasant in a way that I notice men do not feel… and are more like, could be more blunt or more erm… I feel like I know that I’m sort of trying to make people like me … when it’s really not necessary in a business environment so, so erm for that… yeah.’ (Ida, self-identified lesbian woman)  As such, women navigated academia by negotiating alternative discourse associated with heterosexual femininity such as being a people pleaser and talking differently to men that reproduces senior, masculine, white men as the ‘ideal’ that people should seek to ‘please’. However, Blair and Chloe further argued that their experiences in the academy as ‘women’ also were influenced by their non-UK nationality which made them feel like an ‘outlier’ within the dominant discourses of academia. This stresses the importance of intersectionality whereby nationality, sexuality and gender intersect in explaining their experiences navigating academia.  Section 6.4.1 and 6.4.2 will add to the discussion above in order to answer the objective concerning how academics negotiate heteronormativity in constructing sexualities deemed ‘normal’.   6.4 Knowledge production  6.4.1 Passing as straight: ‘valid’ knowledge production Another theme that emerged in the discussions around how participants negotiated heteronormativity in the academy was ‘knowledge production’ whereby certain knowledge were constructed as the ‘truth’ and whilst others were disqualified and further positioned as ‘invalid’ knowledge. For example, the doing and undoing of the academic ‘ideal’ subjectivity was highlighted by Adam, who argued that the academy not only constructs certain heterosexual men as ‘ideal academics’ but also their knowledge as ‘valid’:  ‘If you do not fit that mould, that heterosexual mould, then your knowledge is seen as politically biased… you are a gay man on a gay high horse… and… or… actually… you know… treat you as if you were a counsellor when we’re not… we’re not qualified to do that…’ (Adam, self-identified gay man)  This meant that for academics identifying with non-normative sexualities to ‘pass’ as academics, 107  participants felt a need to conform to an ‘ideal’ subject position associated with being white, straight man. However, if ‘male’ academics were involved in gender research, sexuality research and Athena Swan, areas conflated with ‘feminine interests’, self-identified male participants felt they had to ‘do’ gender in convincing ways to be perceived as ‘manly’. For example, Anthony, a self-identified gay man working in the social policy department, argued that he became aware of ‘the privileges that manhood’ gives him by being an ally to feminist scholars. Informed by performativity theory, Anthony further argued that academic ‘masculinity is fragile, it’s performative and I, I behave consciously and subconsciously in ways to appear more masculine and manly’. Similarly to Adam and Anthony, George, who works in the department of education, navigated academia as privileged ‘passing’ as straight, which he argued meant that his knowledge remained ‘valid’ while teaching. However, asking fellow academic staff for help and support was thought to jeopardize his ‘masculinity’. As seen in discussed in Section 6.3.2, George’s academic knowledge around gender performativity allowed him to recognize the privilege associated with being “straight” passing, although this privilege prevented him from performing a non-heterosexual masculinity in the academy. On the other hand, being read as ‘feminine’ or teaching anything perceived as being related to femininity, meant that Adam’s academic knowledge in the department of psychology was questioned as ‘valid’ as it was seen to diverge from the traditional idea of an academic to be a ‘masculine, straight man’. This is illustrated in the narrative by Adam below:   ‘… I do think students take it out on you more if you are an effeminate gay man or a woman… they are more likely to treat you disrespectfully and to challenge you unduly… I have experienced that for sure and it frustrates me because you see colleagues who just don’t have to deal with it from students at all… and they just think you’re… ‘you’re lazy’… ‘you are not doing writing’… you’re like ‘no I have to deal with the students who for some reason irrationally doesn’t like me because I am not in their view of what an academic should be (like)’. They don’t trust me because I am not a straight, masculine man…. Frustrating… it is…’ (Adam, self-identified gay man)  George, Anthony and Adam’s narratives above illustrate how knowledge is constructed as ‘qualified’ when spoken from a ‘straight passing male’ position stereotypically associated with the ‘ideal academic’. However, gay men and women are associated with ‘femininity’ which means the institutional power held by heteronormativity in academia constructs ‘feminine’ knowledge as 108  ‘disqualified’. This (re)produces male, straight academics as the ‘ideal’ transmitters of knowledge and that knowledge is further being disseminated through research and in teaching. For example, in an attempt to challenge the ‘masculine privilege’ associated with knowledge in theology, Abigail, a self-identified straight woman, had been offered funding to run an event called ‘feminine voice’ where ‘female’ academics were taught to gain respect without ‘sounding like a man’. Abigail’s narrative illustrates the taken for granted assumption that constructs the ‘male voice’ as the ‘ideal voice’:  ‘So either saying or vocally kind of using your voice in a way that, that a man would so, so I had a number of speakers coming in erm and I also had a vocal coach coming in and she worked with women, the women that signed up for it on how to project your voice but also keep it at a pitch you want to see (speaks with a high pitch voice), or you can go kind of deep and you know, and so you just kind of projecting your natural pitch… and, so that was, and that was in reaction, in reaction I guess the experience that I had had teaching where girls, I, I mean I would have been in my early 30s teaching as a PhD student erm and found that the girls and the boys that I was teaching reacted very differently to me… and… that… there was a lack of respect in the classroom, particularly from the boys erm and that, that would really surprise me…’ (Abigail, self-identified straight woman)  This discursive construct of ‘male academics’ as privileged transmitters and producers of knowledge in academia was further referred to by several of the participants to reinforce tensions between ‘power’ and ‘knowledge’ where the ‘power’ is located within the norm. For example, Barnaby reflected on whether his gender and sexuality had ever positively or negatively affected his career, and argued that ‘maleness’ had allowed him to navigate the department of psychology with great privilege because ‘passing’ as straight, white, ‘male’ is never commented on:  ‘You know, white male, you know, it’s a position of great privilege so erm… nobody ever comments on it.... I get invited to those panels where all you see is white men upon the stage and… the questions about where is everybody else get asked and we simply go “hmmm”.’ (Barnaby, self-identified gay man)  It was evident that knowledge production was a restricted process whereby certain knowledge were created as more valued than others. However, these knowledge were (re)produced in the academy 109  as participants stressed they were forced to cite white, straight men to be acknowledged as academics. As such, there was often a need to conform to traditional views on research by for example citing ‘male’ theorists to validate research as ‘qualified’:  ‘… certainly at the beginning of my career I had the feeling that if I wanted to teach stuff on gender or women’s material, writers, theorists, feminist issues then yes, I could do that as long as I covered the male canon. The male concerns first…’  (Doris, self-identified queer bisexual woman)  As seen in the narrative above, Doris could teach feminism and ‘do’ gender research as long as she ‘covered the male canon’. Conforming to the ‘male ideal’ academic norm was referred to by self-identified women as being in tension with their values and research interests as they felt they had to ‘do male research’ and using sexist approaches to be validated and acknowledged as academics. For example, Alex, argued that within the department of classics:  ‘I do get very frustrated sometimes with how traditional my research feels, especially because, you know, the ‘traditional’ in classics is this very elite, white male thing. It’s kind of like, ‘Aargh! I don’t like that I’m using this approach of all these sexist, old, white men.’  (Alex, self-identified bi/pan woman)  As such, heteronormative knowledge deriving from straight white male academics was argued to be reproduced in the academy by citing straight, ‘male’ theorists to construct a viable academic subject position. The normativity of straight, male academic knowledge was also evident in the process of designing reading lists for students that further ensures heteronormative knowledge production remains privileged and undisrupted. Thus, when certain knowledge are constructed as more legitimate than others, it restricts academics diverging from the ‘norm’ from bringing their knowledge and queerness to the discussion but also forces people to negotiate heteronormative knowledge to be deemed ‘normal’.    6.4.2 Doing the undoable: researching sexuality and gender issues As research interests and subjects were constructed as ‘proper’ and ‘qualified’ when spoken from a straight ‘male’ subject position, participants felt that research on sexuality and gender were not valued in the academy, meaning academics’ opportunity to ‘queer’ the traditional subjects and 110  students’ attitudes were restricted. Whereas the participants’ disciplines varied from classics, psychology, history, medicine, education, theology, STEM, economics and sociology, several of the participants including Isabel, Adam, Doris, Alice, Isabel, Dorothy, Grace and Barnaby were conducting sexuality research which was constructed as ‘othered’ in the academy. For example, Tucker, a self-identified straight man, argued that sexuality research and LGBTQIA academics within the department for international relations were perceived as a ‘niche’ group with ‘niche’ interests:  ‘But I expect... I don’t know, I expect there, I expect they [LGBTQIA people] would probably be treated differently possibly because of it, and, erm, and I expect there are people who consider that you must have a niche interest in that for your research, do you know what I mean? I don’t see that for anything other than my own pettiness, but I’m pressed to think that people do exclude other people and staff like that, and they’d just be like “well yes, well I can just research anything”, do you know what I mean?... .Some people are just mean...’ (Tucker, self-identified straight man)  Being constructed and viewed as a ‘niche’ group with ‘peculiar’ research interests by the people in power in the academy meant that participants often felt isolated, excluded and perceived not to ‘fit in’. For example, James, a self-identified gay man was told when he was offered a job within the social work department, that he does not ‘fit’ within the dominant discourse of ‘research’ that academia value. In this manner, James felt his research interests were in tension with the interests of the department of social work:   ‘Yes, and I love what I’m researching at the moment, so, erm, I can’t...  I can’t bring myself to feel bad about it, because, because as I said right at the beginning of the interview, I knew what my department was like, I knew what they valued, and the second sentence that the head of school said to me was, ‘You don’t...  basically you don’t fit in, but it’s fine.’ So I can’t then go in and moan and say, ‘Oh, people aren’t valuing my research.’ I knew that when I, I accepted the job.’ (James, self-identified gay man)  Although James knew his research interests did not ‘match’ the interests of his department before entering academia, James’ narrative highlights the institutional power held by the academy in constructing what constitutes as valuable research. As seen in the narratives presented above and 111  in Section 6.4.1, it was evident from discussions around research and teaching interests that certain subjects and knowledge were found to be more valued and further constructed as ‘fitting in’ with the overall agenda of the academy compared to others. As such, academics that reflexively challenged academic heteronormativity through research or in the classroom felt ‘punished’ and marginalised:  ‘I began to feel erm kind of marginalised and side-lined from other research going on in my research group… and so… one colleague was developing grant, and I would, and I would have been able to offer ideal expertise as if I’m the only sociologist on that grant… and I talked to her about it, and she was all ‘yeah, yeah, yeah’, but then at the end she didn’t include me… erm and that’s very hard to say what that’s about but erm… but as I look back, at my time at [name of previous employer], I think it was about… erm her perceiving me as, associated with being lesbian or bisexual. She never asked me, I never told her… but I did LGBT research, so I think that was the assumption was that I fitted somewhere in there.’ (Grace, self-identified bisexual woman)  In this way, the ‘norm’ constituted by the academy, constructs sexuality research as insubstantial research topics that does not add value to the dominant discourse constructed around ‘ideal research interests’. By ‘doing’ sexuality and gender research, academics were perceived as no longer ‘passing’ as straight hence ‘not fitting in’. This further resulted in creating an ‘us’ and ‘them’ binary where queer research was devalued as ‘other’, rather than being incorporated to the dominant and traditional research subjects that was associated with ‘professionalism’:  ‘… I feel like sexuality studies are kind of in this kind of tiny box within gender studies and there isn’t much recognition of queerness in a wider sense or like in a wider sense, it is still quite marginalised, it’s kind of like “oh I’m gonna go and study with the other queer people” rather than bringing everything together into subject areas….’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  The issue of not being validated as an academic by identifying as LGBTQIA was also discussed by Ash, who identifies as genderqueer. They felt afraid that staying in academia meant jeopardising their credibility as an academic, particularly within a masculine environment such as STEM:  112  ‘… I don’t think sexuality would be a problem, I am mildly concerned that if I stay in academia and I kept publishing work and got more assertive about my gender I wouldn’t be “Ash” who does the really interesting work on this, I’d be, you know, “Ash” the weird one…. “Ash” the one who’s trans.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  As such, being associated with LGBTQIA identities or research were argued to be restrictive for career progression as it does not conform to norms around academic ‘validity’. For example, James thought his department would be happier if he did ‘other stuff’ thus argued that ‘I might get a promotion quicker if I was doing other stuff’. The issue of restricted career progression by conducting sexuality and gender research was further reflected by Barnaby. For example, he argued that one of his colleagues were long seen as ‘just dabbling around with the queer stuff’ and his promotion to professor was therefore long overdue. This had to do with the validity of queer research and Barnaby further argued:  ‘Because if you’re doing LGBT stuff with vulnerable populations, or doing qualitative work, the idea that you’re going to be as able as your colleague next door to get some multimillion, you know, project grant… is unlikely… there are ways to get some funding but you’re not in the same bowl. So, I mean, I think that played into it, and again you’re never sure whether it was the individual that was involved, you know, colleagues or whether it’s… you know, of you’re getting excuses...’ (Barnaby, self-identified gay man)  Thus, Barnaby argued qualitative research and LGBT research were constructed as devalued in the academy due to the limited need for large grants. However, Drew, a self-identified bisexual, grey ace woman, further argued that the lack of grants available to fund LGBT research and LGBT academics could be due to the invisibility of LGBT staff. She thus argued that by being visible and ‘saying that I am bisexual’ could mean agencies become aware that ‘we’re here’ which would increase the likelihood of support and funding. Paradoxically, Bianca, a self-identified gay woman working in the department of education argued that although her work could potentially be situated within queer theory, she reflexively distanced herself from using words such as ‘queer’ in her PhD thesis to avoid punishment:  ‘I can’t use the word queer in the context of academic selection because that would be an immediate barrier to policy makers who don’t want to be perceived to be doing anything at 113  all with queers.’ (Bianca, self-identified gay woman)  Additionally, Adam, whose research was on the ‘male body image’, felt that as an openly gay man, he was pressured into doing research on gay and bisexual men’s health, and would not be asked to review issues around “straight” men’s health. However, as a gay man reviewing gay men’s health he encountered homophobia by editors. The narrative below is an example of how the intersection of ‘straightness’ and ‘academic’ are discursive constructs that go hand in hand to maintain and (re)produce heterosexual knowledge as ‘normal’ and ‘compulsory’. The ‘norm’, meaning straight academic men, were argued to have influential power to decide what information and which voices/knowledge are worthy of being disseminated:   A  The reviewer said ‘I wonder about the impact of the facilitator’, which is me, ‘being gay when the majority of young men were not. Is it likely that this may have caused some lack of engagement if the sexuality for the paper was made evident? If not made evident, what is the relevance of telling us the facilitator was gay?’…  but what they were basically saying is that, why… how can a gay man run an intervention where the majority of the students were straight? … Secondly, what it implies then is that gay men aren’t really men… and straight men are… and so how can a non-man run a group for men…. obviously I don’t get to disclose my sexuality or not, since it’s a read… people mostly know that I am gay without me saying….so… it’s nothing I have a choice over… So I was reviewing another paper… the journal paper was on men and health and it was explicitly like men’s prostate cancer review… I’m pretty sure it was that…  and then when I was reviewing it, in the message, they said… they went “the following men have been excluded: gay men and original men that were homeless and drug users…” Q  what?! A  full stop… “these groups of men are special and beyond the scope of the paper”… (Adam, self-identified gay man)  Drawing on discourse of heteronormativity, the reviewers Adam referred to questioned Adams validity as ‘facilitator’ and fellow ‘reviewer’ due to the assumption that gay men are not ‘real’ men, thus their knowledge cannot be ‘true’. Further, Adam stressed that this false and damaging knowledge produced as ‘normal’ support the assumption that gay men are transmitters of disease 114  and that heterosexual men would not get prostate checks because they ‘were worried that it would make them gay’, which is disseminated as ‘true’. Additionally, stereotyping ‘gay men’ as ‘non-men’ and ‘drug users’, was further reflected on by Jack, a self-identified Chinese gay man, doing his PhD in the UK:  ‘In Chinese culture, people may think these kinds of people are weird and, somehow, they do not obey the sexual morality. They may have a lot of sex partners. Yes. They may be drug takers. They take a lot of drugs and they may have very bad disease. Yes. And we can understand them but we have to be somehow separated from them. They are playing with themselves and none of our business. This kind of attitude is somehow, for me, frustrating and disappointing.’ (Jack, self-identified gay man)  As such, homophobic and misleading information equating ‘gay men’ as not ‘real men’ and ‘special’ is disseminated through research and in the classroom as ‘normative’ views that continues to be reproduced and unchallenged. Further, Alex, a self-identified bi/pan woman, argued that as the most active researchers on feminism and feminist perspectives ‘are not straight, white men’ she felt more comfortable discussing gender and sexuality issues with women in the classics department, as they did not challenge the legitimacy of her knowledge. Thus, as women were more likely to conduct sexuality and gender research and have a stronger sense of ‘feminism’, Brian argued that men in the academy often deemed women’s interests and voices as insubstantial:  ‘… you know, without mentioning names, you know in staff meetings… I’ve, I’ve seen examples where female members of staff that are belittled by senior male colleagues… erm, you know, because of either their research, or made comments or their questions aren’t deemed as being er…. Appropriate… erm… which is quite, quite shocking when you’re not used to seeing that… and I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know if it is too simplistic to say that it’s er, er an age issue……but it seems to be… yeah older age. I mean, this is probably really unfair but certainly in my own experience old, you know, older white men… throwing their weight around…’ (Brian, self-identified gay man)  The issues around male academics ‘throwing their weight around’ was also argued by Tucker, a self-identified straight man, as something that he was warned about before entering academia. Particularly, he had been warned that academia is ‘really sexist for instance’ where ‘more senior 115  people, in higher hierarchy, abuse their positions to keep down people who are a risk to them’. This leads to the next section, in answering objective three, which presents the findings concerning the contextual factors restricting queer visibility and becoming in the academy.   6.5 Academic regimes of exclusion In order to disrupt and identify how heteronormativity is (re)produced in academia it was found that professional practices restrict and marginalise non-heterosexual voices and identities. While academia was thought to, ideally, be a liberal workplace and space that transmits and facilitates liberal views, knowledge, and critical thinking, it was apparent that this expectation did not match the reality of the 21st century academia. In order to answer objective three, this section will discuss the exclusionary practices that restrict academics from bringing sexualities and gender expressions to work.   6.5.1 New MANagerialism The tensions between expectations and reality of academia were noted by several of the participants as being due to the changing nature of academia towards new managerialist approaches, marketization and the need to ‘follow the money’. Although this might benefit the ‘traditional’ subject areas that is valued in academia, as discussed in Section 6.4.2, it was found to restrict the process of bringing ‘sexuality to work’. Increased competitiveness for resources also causes tensions and conflict among marginalised identities and ‘othered’ research interests:  ‘Even within like erm… the marginalized identities everyone is very competitive, like stuff comes up where it feels like it’s erm… either race studies or LGBT studies rather than both together, which is all about constraints of resources making people feel like it is a competition.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  Additionally, participants argued that the visibility of diversity, in particular sexuality and gender diversity through research, was in tension with the overall vision and strategies of UK academia, as discussed in Section 6.4.2. Participants thus discussed difficulties gaining respect and acknowledgement for researching topics such as sexuality and gender as queer research do not require significant funds to be executed:  ‘I mean fund queer projects, why don’t they fund like interdisciplinary research and then, 116  and then sell that instead like without putting funding into queer research would massively increased how like how welcoming spaces is for queer people instead of saying ‘oh we’re so diverse.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  Additionally, as new managerialism facilitates and values a ‘publish or perish’ approach it was argued to cause added stress for academics not following the normative hence ‘ideal’ academic route towards research. Reflecting on the difficulties associated with publishing sexuality research, Dorothy argued that her co-authors’ work within the department of social health, which was associated as more ‘traditional’ research, would generally go ‘straight to print’. She thus argued that within sexual minority health research, it is significantly more difficult to publish ‘and you have to go through much more peer review, get many more rejections and so on and so forth’. Schroedinger, a self-identified heterosexual man working in the department of business and technology, further argued universities had changed to facilitate a ‘male like business persona’, whereby universities cast academics that does not fit into the ‘male academic’ discourse as an outsider:  ‘Um, I mean in terms of… in terms of gender and sexuality issues I don’t know whether the right person to be leading the department or any of the departments there… I have a feeling… it’s a sense more than anything else, that they would like to choose business males to do that. Who can be business… very business savvy and they will… I… again, it’s not experience but it’s a guess that actually I think the women might feel a bit left out because they don’t necessarily have the same, erm, immediate persona. I hope that sounds okay.’ (Schroedinger, self-identified straight man)  In this narrative, Schroedinger constructs the leader of any department as straight, man, masculine and business savvy, whereby he constructs women as not having the ‘same, erm, immediate persona’ thus cannot be leading the department. This ‘male like persona’ that Schroedinger refers to was thought to restrict people from performing queerness and tended to facilitate career progression for white, straight men as discussed by Doris, a self-identified queer bisexual woman:  ‘I think there certainly, I mean in terms of career progression, again, my university has got much better, but there was certainly very much a bias in favour for people who were very research active erm people that had a very linear trajectory from PhD to researcher to 117  professor, obviously those people were much more likely to be male…. Must be white, middle class etc. again, it’s getting a bit better, people are being recognized for different kinds of academic activities erm such as teaching or leadership. But yeah, it is still the case that, so in my institution at the [employers name], [it] is a very big Russell group institution and in that it is almost exclusively white and male.’ (Doris, self-identified queer bisexual woman)  Although Doris argues that her university had become better at inclusivity and recognising the work of academics that are not ‘straight, white men’, it was still evident that new managerialist practices attempted to squeeze people into narrow categories to ensure no one diverge from the ‘norm’. As such, this macho culture of academia was found to restrict people from coming out:  ‘I think like… all of the stuff that is coming in is inherently macho masculine right, the more we mimic the business world that’s the kind of masculine and male dominated world and that just squeezes people… erm just to feel that they have to fit into this box where they can’t be controversial or come out with anything that’s quite jeopardizing their position right, everyone feel like this feeling of instability where coming out is taken away from you and erm ‘let us tell us a lie without lying’, ‘(I’m) definitely isn’t queer’ right.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  Schroedinger, Alice and Doris’ narratives illustrate how new managerialism promotes and facilitates a masculinalization of the academy whereby academics are pressured to conform to a ‘male like’ academic persona, a person who is not ‘queer’. For example, issues around marketization, treating students as customers, and the increased pressures of efficiency was argued by Brian to ‘interfere with the joys of the diversity that exists’, which Adam further argued meant that academia was no longer ‘a place for everybody, but a certain type of student’. The lack of visibility and diversity amongst staff restricted performance of various genders and sexualities amongst staff but also students entering the university, which further forces students and staff into a ‘gay friendly closet’. Drew therefore argued that new managerialism is an issue within the department of education:  ‘I mean, it’s a problem because students don’t fit that role necessarily so there are more disabled students, more students of colour, more LGBT students than there are staff working in, so teaching or research staff, so the balance isn’t right and the higher up the sort of 118  academic kind of, erm, rungs of the ladder that you go, the less diverse it is really so there’s a mismatch between sort of people who run universities and students who are actually coming to universities.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace woman)  The issue around recruiting a certain type of student and staff was evident in Adam and Drew’s discussions to reduce the diversity that academia should portray. However, not recruiting ‘certain types’ of staff actually meant that Kaitlin’s employer had lost their recruitment targets due to their inability to employ women, which ‘is having a bad impact on our admissions of women because we are actually under-recruiting female students compared with the numbers we should’. As managerial practices privilege a specific ‘academic ideal’, often an intersection of being white, straight, able-bodied and ‘male’, meant that only certain groups of men were promoted to professors hence (re)producing the ‘norm’ rather than queering the academy.   ‘Yeah erm… I don’t know… I think it (academia) is such a mad environment, even like the sociology is like a… most of my undergraduate are women right? … and then at PhD level it’s about 40 per cent women, but then if I look around at my department it’s like 60, 70 per cent men… right? probably 70 per cent men, so like… so you’ve lost women at all those stages erm… and… so… because of that it’s very masculine and erm…. I’ve seen like women colleagues being really torn to pieces by… early career academics torn to pieces by men in this department.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  The new managerialist agenda has also resulted in many universities having branch campuses in countries where LGBTQIA people are not recognized and their rights are non-existing. This was found to restrict career progression as academics doing queer research, and identifying with LGBTQIA categories, found their career trajectory blocked by not being able to attend conferences in countries where they or their research are not recognized. Additionally, by not being able to disseminate queer research or knowledge in teaching in countries where universities have branch campuses, cisnormativity and heteronormativity is reproduced as the ‘norm’. For example, Ida was doing some work in Uganda, which meant that she could not come out. Similarly, Doris was looking at a vacancy in America, but was afraid her queer family would not be recognized due to the political changes in the country. Further, Jack, a gay man from China, who was doing his PhD in the UK, found it freeing to perform queerness in the UK but was afraid that his family, who are very traditional, were trying to force him into arranged marriage upon his return. The discussions 119  above reflect the one-dimensional agenda of new managerialism to fund and support research active academics’ interests that usually benefitted white, straight, able-bodied, male academics.   6.5.2 Negotiating sexism  As seen in sections 6.2 and 6.3, respondents referred to sexism in order to position themselves as ‘female’ or woman, while ‘male’ academics were negotiating sexism to facilitate socialisation and access to ‘academia’s gentleman’s club’. However, tied to sexism is heteronormativity, which does not only result in exclusion of ‘othered’ academics but also marginalizes, questions and challenges the knowledge and belongingness within the academy. Sexism was often referred to as a regime that silenced women and marginalised voices whereby Tucker, a self-identified straight man, working in the department of international relations argued it was his responsibility to support women ‘because I think they face so much sexism, you get awful senior members of staff… see it as a chance to interrogate (them)’. To start the discussion, Schroedinger, a self-identified straight man, argued that to ‘pass’ and navigate academia’s invisible and unmarked norm (meaning white, straight male), means engaging in sexism. In particular, Schroedinger referred to sexism in order to position himself as ‘a fairly normal man’:  A Ah, ooh, ah [pauses thinking]. I would probably like to say I’m a fairly normal, erm… fairly normal man but… erm… ooh. I want to say not… not explicitly sexist, not, erm… not arrogantly male. But… but… I’m… I’m… I’m a man who is confident in who I am. That’s probably the best I can get to. Q Yeah, were there any things you were thinking of but decided to leave out? A Um, ooh [pauses thinking]. Er, yeah, there’s something in there and I’m trying to get my head round some words for it. Er, I suppose… I suppose one of the problems when I say I describe as a fairly typical man is that, erm… that to a lot… to some extent does include a very… or sometimes a bit of a sexist approach or… or the… the arrogance that often comes with that. And I’m working to avoid that because I’m not, that’s why I sort of… I think I went down the confidence because it’s… it’s not… it’s not… not… erm, me who feels I have to belittle anybody else for their own choices in any sense. Q Yeah, yeah, erm, and when you say sexist approach what do you mean by that? A I suppose I see a lot of… a lot of men who post or talk and their comments are sometimes unwittingly sexist. I mean Donald Trump is a prime example of somebody who is wittingly sexist but actually I think his style is… is one that is, erm, seen as being 120  a good… or a… the epitome of what real… a real man is about. And… and I’m wanting to say that that is not… I don’t agree with that standing but I think for a lot of men some think of that… they’ve got to be a bit sort of laddish, a bit, erm, a bit intimidating, sexist or genderist jokes.’ (Schroedinger, self-identified heterosexual man)  The tensions between negotiating discourses constructing the ‘real man’ and engaging in ‘sexism’ was further argued to create appropriate roles for men and women in the academy whereby to ‘pass’ as a ‘real man’ meant conforming to the norms created by academia’s ‘gentleman’s club’. It was therefore found that academia’s white, straight, research active, ‘older’ gentleman’s club had the power to create knowledge associated with what counts as ‘academic’ and ‘other’. Further, the people with power were thought to create ‘intelligible’ subjects, a privilege only available to straight, white academic men engaging in sexism:  ‘…You know, on the one side I do get personal abuse and I have suffered from being somebody who is a man and also speaks up about sexism...’ (Tucker, self-identified straight man)   The personal abuse Tucker referred to was being made redundant and his knowledge had been questioned as ‘valid’ where he was positioned as ‘other’ from men by being a man who ‘speaks up about sexism’ rather than engaging in it. Reflecting on the process of becoming an ‘unintelligible’ academic by ‘undoing’ gender through taking on scripts being associated with women, Tucker’s ‘maleness’ was questioned:  ‘… I mean I don’t think it’s necessarily female and male roles because I consider myself a man but I probably fulfil a female role if it’s a female to male role…. I don’t think it’s female roles and male roles; I think it’s sexism roles.’ (Tucker, self-identified straight man)  These ‘sexism roles’ positions men as sexist and women as receivers of sexism whereby men challenging sexism were ‘othered’ and equalled to ‘women’, which was further associated with becoming an ‘unintelligible academic’. The issues around academic sexism was found to further (re)produce men’s privilege, as sexist behaviour was not being challenged or questioned, which resulted in women perceiving their roles in the academy to be devalued:   121  ‘I mean, like, he’s left now but we did have, er, one professor who was just a pervy old man you know. To the extent that we like warned each other, like ‘yeah, just don’t get too close to him. Don’t be alone with him. He’s quite creepy’.... And it was one of those things where he was like a really respected professor and sort of like a lot of the department’s reputation rested on him, so it’s kind of like... You know, this feeling that we all just have to put up with it.’ (Alex, self-identified bi/pan woman)  Additionally, both Abigail and Dorothy had experienced upfront sexism whereby they were forced to be perceived to not be an ‘academic fit’ whereby men’s privilege and sexist behaviour were both privileged and (re)produced as ‘normal’:  ‘At one stage I had erm a Head of Department who was a bully… and erm was very unpleasant… another time I had a line manager who was sexually assaulting me… but erm instead of giving up, what I have been able to do is move job to a better job…. but academia is such that if you have that kind of a label on you, like if you’ve gone to an employment tribunal for instance er you can find it very difficult to get your next job.  My line manager in one of the universities uh kept on, well he, the first thing he did was eh when we were at a conference and coming back after the end of the conference we were staying in a hotel and he was in the lobby where he put his arm around my shoulder and then put his hand on my tits… I was just so shocked, I ducked under his arm and ran away… he kept on touching me and I kept on telling that I don’t like him touching me. And… he just didn’t take any notice and kept on doing it… I told the head of department erm but no action was taken and… erm so I went and found a job elsewhere…’ (Dorothy, self-identified gender-neutral lesbian)  Further, Abigail, a self-identified heterosexual woman working in theology, had experienced sexism to the extent that she was ‘pushed’ out of the academy and had to work from home. Abigail thus argued that her working culture was particularly sexist to the extent that it made her feel unsafe at work:  ‘… my boss is passive-aggressive and we’re a research team, which means we all work in the same office erm… and he’s quite sexist, and… and the institution that surrounds him hasn’t helped with that. erm, so in that sense my working culture is particularly horrific, I would say that there have been times when I don’t feel particularly safe.’ (Abigail, self-122  identified straight woman)  Although George argued that it is of utmost importance talking about sexuality and gender issues in the academy, he constructed his working culture in the department of education as an unsafe place to come out, as academic socialisation relied on heteronormative and sexist approaches to ‘pass as one of the men’:  ‘I think it is an important thing to talk about and to give voice to it, as I say the more we talk about these issues, the better. and I know that I don’t put that into practice, and potentially that is a little bit hypocritical of me to not feel safe to talk about it out there in the corridor but…’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  Similar to how coming out as non-heterosexual made the ‘male’ body visible, pregnancy made the ‘female’ body visible which was constructed as not having a place in the academy as it diverge from the ideal academic ‘body’. As such, Alice stated that one of her friends in the sociology department had been told ‘basically not to get pregnant during the PhD’. However, Doris could pass as ‘a man’ or ‘one of us’ by coming out as a ‘queer woman’, as it was implied she did not want children due to not fitting male academics’ expectations of the ‘patriarchy’ whereby men subordinates and fertilise women. Embodying queerness thus resulted in desexualisation of the ‘female’ body whereby male colleagues saw Doris’ sexuality as ‘positive’ as she was not ‘going to risk having children like those silly other women’:  ‘… you know, so, obviously that is an homophobic and awful sexist assumption but there was this kind of feeling that I was on their side in a sense…’ (Doris, self-identified queer bisexual woman)  Tucker thus argued that men in the academy ‘see any precedence of women on male employment as an unnecessary threat to male expertise’. As such, the study found the men’s academy has the institutional power to create appropriate gendered norms that reinforce binarism whereby academics read or perceived as ‘feminine’ are expected to do more administrative tasks, pastoral care, and engage in activities that are not perceived as ‘academically valuable’. As such, masculinity is produced as the dominant ‘academic’ discourse and femininity is degraded to ‘support’ roles. For example, Abigail, a self-identified heterosexual woman working within the 123  theology department, argued she was expected to do tasks that male academics would not be asked to do, such as sorting refreshments for events ‘as if having a vagina means that I can pick better chocolate biscuits’. Additionally, Ash reflected on their experience working in STEMM and argued that because they were perceived as ‘female’ in their research group, where the majority were ‘male’, they felt that they were expected to do more ‘female bonding’ as well as other tasks perceived as belonging to women:   ‘There is a slightly interesting thing that I started out baking erm for group meeting when I was in my first year erm and we now got the point where we have set up a routine and there are three people who bake regularly and all of them or are perceived as female and none of the blokes are volunteering… to join in with that erm… there’s gender division of labour thing in labs as well because we work in clean labs erm we clean our own labs, there is a router again, erm or rather there is signup sheets, people get signed up to clean the lab when they are in anyway erm it is… more frequently people who are female coded or female perceived doing the cleaning the lab than…’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  As men were constructed as ideal academics, self-identified women in this study argued they often were talked over by men in the academy and their voices and knowledge were silenced to the extent that Abigail argued ‘I think the thing I find most difficult is just feeling like the, the system isn’t interested in my voice’. The issue around silencing women was further discussed by Anthony as an issue he had noticed in the academy:   ‘So I basically noticed them around women’s inclusion and sort of basic things like men talking over women erm men not giving women space in seminars to ask questions and things like that and erm a, and also like because Athena Swan is all about almost auditing gender inclusion, some of the things we found in our Athena Swan application was quite erm shocking and erm when we presented them to members of erm sort of… management and leadership staff involved they get, often they get quite defensive around it… so I suppose yeah that’s how I’d describe the culture.’ (Anthony, self-identified gay man)  Additionally, both Tucker and Adam reflected on academic sexism and argued that they were aware of the difficulties of being a woman in the academy both as students and staff, particularly 124  as more senior straight men used their power to rate attractiveness of women:   ‘Um, ah, yes talking about, erm, talking about having a relationship with, ah, a student as a respectable job. erm, talking about, ah, erm, students in derogatory terms about their, ah, their rating on their attractiveness or how hot they are and things like that; it’s just awful.’ (Tucker, self-identified straight man)  Similar to Tucker, Adam also argued that men in the psychology department misused their authority and as such he reflected on his process of coming out to make it easier for women to have someone to talk to:   ‘I also do it because we have the majority of women on the course and I am cautious that men in my position as a lecturer have taken advantage of that… have inappropriate relationships with female students… including in my institution… and I am very cautious about how they are like… and I think that it is wrong… so I like to… I guess… make students feel at ease and say “I am gay”.’ (Adam, self-identified gay man)  However, interestingly, complicit masculinities were also evident as Brian recalled an event whereby a gay member of staff had belittled women in the academy to secure his position as a ‘real man’ and reinforce the ‘patriarchy within the gay male culture’:  ‘…So we have, in our staff meetings we have erm short research exchanges where staff present er a project they are working on over seven minutes… and it is over lunch and then we have questions and answers, and then we have the formal meeting. erm and I think one of my female colleagues was talking about, she was actually talking about erm… queer spaces for people of colour in London… erm, and this guy was rolling his eyes the whole way through, the, the older gay guy. erm and at the end said something like ‘oh, this is really relevant, why don’t you go back to your day job’ or something, you know, something along those lines.’ (Brian, self-identified gay man)  The discussions above have highlighted the issues around sexism and the downgrading and marginalisation of femininity, and particularly the ‘female’ body in the academy. Sexism was found to be used as a tool to secure men’s domination of women and LGBTQIA academics while 125  (re)producing (hetero)masculinity as the ideal embodiment.   6.5.3 Work-life balance: negotiating heteronormativity in academic socialisation While new managerialist approaches and sexism were topics that guided discussions around academic culture and inequality, another issue that facilitates workplace inequalities for LGBTQIA academics was normative expectations around the ‘nuclear family’, monogamy, marriage and working 24/7. This section will discuss the implications that traditional views on the ‘nuclear family’ has for LGBTQIA academics and their entitlement to request flexible working, but also how the participants navigated heteronormativity in academic socialisation and interactions. Due to academia’s neglect of understanding queer issues, the absence of networks, and the lack of space to bring sexuality to work, as seen in Section 6.3.1, it was argued that the ‘life’ aspect of work-life balance is vital for academics to find LGBTQIA communities:   ‘I don’t think people necessarily realise kind of what, what kind of life is like as a gay man in...  particularly for work. Work, I don’t think people realise what life is like as a gay man living in Manchester. They just have...  it’s such a different world to, erm, to the heterosexual world, erm, and I think that’s why things like the research project I’m doing, people find it hard to get their heads round it, because they...  I just assume that most people in my department... most people in my department are straight.’ (James, self-identified gay man)  Similar to James, Alice stressed there is an underlying belief that everyone in academia is “straight”, which means that people neglect to understand how people identifying with various sexualities and genders form alternative families and relationships. By being assumed “straight” and expected to work 24/7, it was argued that queer academics did not have any space or time in their private life to form important relationships with queer communities:   ‘Um and there is actually the idea that… as an academic you’ve got to be childfree and always single as well and erm you haven’t got time just to do anything else, academia is the life or to have to do anything outside of that erm and that is, like if you’re queer or non-monogamous or whatever you’re… that doesn’t leave any space, whereas this space needs to have relationships and to do that, there isn’t much else.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  126  Although Alice argued there is an expectation that for a career in academia, ‘you’ve got to be childfree’, childrearing were further constructed by the gentleman’s club as a ‘woman’s job’. For example, Tucker, a self-identified heterosexual man, who very much wanted to take part in the upbringing of his child, argued he felt excluded from ‘male’ socialisation by wanting to spend time with his child. Tucker thus argued that he did not comply with the group norms of academia by taking an active part in childrearing, hence did not ‘fulfil a… classic male role’ whereby male academics ‘socialise and complain about pay, family… and things like that’. The statement by Tucker shows how socialisation relies on heteronormative language constructed around ‘normative’ family-talk. Participants thus argued that socialisation was restricted to heteronormative conforming academics whereby academics with children socialises together, which Kaitlin argued ‘isn’t necessarily LGBT inclusive’. This further resulted in exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and trans families as the narrow idea of what constitutes a ‘family’ is highly informed by heteronormativity being (re)produced through for example ‘family-friendly policies’:  ‘Employment has quite often, has quite a narrow definition of what ‘family’ is … what is generally understood by family-friendly isn’t necessarily a good reflection of everybody’s families erm or everybody’s you know, friendship that works… so there is a lot of stuff like where, you know, in accommodating to one sort of family we’ve kind of forgotten that not everybody’s life works like that…’  (Kaitlin, self-identified bisexual woman)  Further, maternity leave and paternity leave were both constructed as (re)producing heteronormative and cisnormative assumptions of ‘women’ being mothers and ‘men’ as fathers. However, when a ‘woman’ identified as the ‘non-biological mother’, it was causing gender trouble. This was the case with Doris, a self-identified queer bisexual woman, who had a child with her partner. However, because she interpreted the legal system to not recognise non-biological mothers as mothers, she felt forced to take paternity leave and was further treated like a ‘man’:  ‘I suppose one thing that I found difficult is surrounding parenting actually…  and queer parenting and the really… the most difficult thing was erm going back to work two weeks after my daughter was born because I… my partner gave birth to our daughter, I didn’t so I was treated like a man, I had paternity leave… men… men go back to work two weeks after having their child and… so… I did as well… but… having been socialising as a 127  woman I found that really difficult…I’m sure it is very difficult for men as well, you know, to leave their baby after two weeks but I think it is something that they are brought up to expect that they wouldn’t be involved in that very early stage of childrearing… erm… whereas it was expected of me that, because I wasn’t the birth partner I didn’t need… need to be attend with my child… er… I found that really difficult…’ (Doris, self-identified queer bisexual woman)  Born and raised in a heteronormative society, Doris argued men are expected to go back to work two weeks after their child is born, while women are expected to be more ‘involved in that very early stage of childrearing’. However, by being read as woman and known as a parent, but not the birth-mother, Doris could no longer be read as complying with the normative scripts associated with hetero-parenting and therefore felt forced to take paternity leave. As such, Kaitlin, Doris and Adam argued that parental leave were constructed as ‘straight people’s rights’ excluding queer families and reproducing inequality:  ‘Maternity leave, like you know, that’s discussed and it is really important for sure, but obviously you know, if there was a gay academic who had adopted there is no idea that you know that person will have the same maternity that a straight woman would have. Or pensions for instance… I know there are policies in some organizations for partners, but there is no awareness about that at all.’ (Adam, self-identified gay man)  Although the participants recognised that there were practices in place to facilitate parental leave, it was perceived as a non-inclusive arrangement whereby LGBTQIA participants felt it were often assumed they did not have or want children. For example Barnaby, a self-identified gay man, argued that although two of his colleagues, one woman and one man, who had children were given flexible arrangements ‘nobody bothers to ask me, but whether that is because I’m gay or whether they know I don’t want children’. LGBTQIA academics therefore felt their families and relationships were not recognized as ‘valid’ which meant that their voice and needs were silenced as were their identities and relationships:  ‘um… well I suppose, you know, all those kind of, and I think it’s, it’s like in a lot of environments it would be very nice to see erm… see ourselves reflected back, so you know when they’re doing publicity erm… if they’re talking about parental leave for example, they 128  could talk about parental leave for same-sex parent as well as opposite sex parents.’ (Grace, self-identified bisexual woman)  However, it was further stressed that LGBTQIA academics had a different relationship to their ‘blood families’ than what might be implied by heteronormative ideas of ‘family’ and did not necessarily refer to their birth family as their ‘family’ but rather constructed friends as their closest relationships. For example, James had longstanding friends from the gay community that he constructed as his family whereas his very small biological family were ‘family just by accident, basically’. James argued that some of his friends were like fathers, aunts, uncles and brothers to him, which was not necessarily understood in heteronormative institutions like academia:   ‘I don’t think I ever explain those relationships to people at work, erm, it just never really comes up, but, but equally, like...  so I was, I was at a weekend away with my choir, erm, this weekend, and there were lots of people saying, ‘It’s like a family,’ erm, and it is, and people just implicitly understand that, but people don’t implicitly understand that at work. They just don’t kind of get those family connections that I think gay people do form for a variety of reasons.’ (James, self-identified gay man)  Similarly, Doris argued, that within heteronormative frames, there is a tendency to expect that everyone have close relationships with their birth families, which is an assumption that does not necessarily hold for queer people. For example, Doris’ parents distanced themselves from Doris after her child was born, which was something that people that did not identify as ‘queer’ could sensitise themselves with:   ‘I think I have often had to explain, justify why my gender or my sexuality makes my experiences different. And that that difference is valid… so they make these assumptions “oh why can’t the parents come up and look after the baby while you’re at this conference”, and I’m like “oh no, actually, being queer means you don’t necessary have that kind of family network”, for example… so it is more trying to explain why it is different for queer persons, and how that might impact on my work..’ (Doris, self-identified queer bisexual woman)  As such, it was found that the ‘nuclear family’ was an important socialisation topic in the academy whereby bonds and networks at work were created through similar lifestyles, such as having a 129  family, which made academics that did not conform to this norm perceive themselves as an ‘outlier’. Blair, a self-identified gender-neutral lesbian, argued that ‘everybody is expected to have a family’ and by not having children ‘you are also expected in some sense to do more because you don’t have a family’. Although they had never been asked to do more, Blair argued that work-life was not an issue related to sexuality, but rather an issue of ‘general non-conforming to family’. However, if people without children are expected to do more, then work-life balance initiatives are constructed to facilitate the interest of heteronormative families. Academic socialisation was thus found to be implicitly heteronormative where non-normative academics felt forced to silence their identities and relationships. As a result, LGBTQIA academics did not feel entitled to request flexible working arrangements as LGBTQIA academics’ ‘life’ was not regarded as ‘valid’ if it does not comply with heterosexual rules of relationships and family. Ash, for example, argued that they wanted to request time off for their breast surgery, however, unless they drew upon heteronormative language, they did not feel people would understand the importance of taking time off work for Ash:  ‘um… it… it does feel like I can’t be myself at work, it does feel like it makes it harder to make friends at work because… there is so much of myself that I am just politely keeping away from people…and I don’t feel like emotional intimacy or… is… is possible without feeling able to be casual and open about with the degree of self-monitoring I do to not… risk inviting a bunch of really intrusive questions and then being perceived as rude if I say actually I would rather not discuss this…, but it feels a bit wired that I can’t go “and I’m really excited about this surgery and I’ve been looking forward to it for five years and… or longer.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  Ash’s narrative illustrates how heteronormativity restricts certain subjects from being taken up in the academy and further ensures that certain lives are excluded from the discussion, as Ash felt ‘I cannot be myself at work’ because ‘there is so much of myself that I am politely keeping away from people’, which further ‘makes it harder to make friends at work’. However, within their immediate social circle, Ash felt that people would be more supportive and understand the importance of getting a top surgery where their friends would treat it as exciting as getting engaged. The lack of recognition for queer rights and families was also thought to restrict career progression as families might not be recognized in foreign countries. For example, Doris had thought about applying for a fellowship in Princeton but was worried about issues around recognition such as ‘would I be 130  recognized as the parent of my daughter, would my daughter arrive health insurance because I am not her biological parent’. Doris thus stresses issues around heteronormativity as universally privileged whereby certain families and relationships are constructed as more ‘valid’ and ‘welcomed’ than others.   The privileging of heterosexuality in the academy was also reflected on by Kaitlin, a self-identified bisexual woman, arguing that straight identifying academics are offered spouse packages that facilitate career progression and reproduces the normality of heterosexuality, benefits that are seen as unavailable to LGBTQIA academics. Work-life balance initiatives, and academic policies, are thus implicitly made for heterosexual people following normative understandings of ‘life’, privileging academics who does not disrupt such normative arrangements. As such, the study found LGBTQIA academics challenges heteronormative assumptions underpinning work-life balance initiatives by for example having several partners, creating a family through self-insemination or referring to oneself as ‘parent’ detached from gender expectations, which causes gender trouble in the heteronormative academy.   6.6 Towards inclusivity As part of the interview schedule, participants were asked what they thought universities could do to facilitate and improve inclusivity towards gender and sexuality issues. Although the thesis stress radical change is needed in order to ‘queer’ the academy away from what is considered ‘normative’, which is discussed in Section 9.7.2 and 9.7.3, research participants suggested a more liberal approach towards ‘queering the academy’. Several participants argued there had been positive changes towards facilitating inclusivity of sexuality and gender through equality and diversity practices and policies, however, they were often regarded as ‘empty shells’:  ‘I think first of all they can do is stop thinking of inclusivity as some kind of extra thing or extra burden, just the newest buzz word, you know, that they have to deal with. I think they need to start thinking about inclusivity in terms of people, in terms of what it means to people to be, to support them and to be inclusive of all the ways in which they can bring their own identities in a positive way.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace woman)  The topics that were referred to by participants as important for a queerer academy included increased visibility, support networks and “straight” allies. These will be discussed in the sections 131  below.   6.6.1 Visibility One of the ways in which universities could show support to LGBTQIA staff and students was through increased visibility. For example, Eric, Bob, Chloe and Caroline stressed that having rainbow lanyards helped show support for LGBTQIA staff and students while also being a visible sign that could help staff being ‘visibly out’ without having to ‘come out’. Additionally, Anthony argued that by raising the rainbow flag for LGBT history month and pride month, his university shows acceptance and inclusivity for LGBT students and staff. Ash stressed the importance of visibility and the impact it has on students and on their wellbeing, as they felt isolated being the only ‘out’ person in secondary school:  ‘Um, one of the things that I really like about teaching is that I get to be visibly disabled and importantly I get to be visibly queer. And it is really lovely watching the undergraduates particularly the nervous freshers sort of gradually realising that the reason why I’m wearing a rainbow bracelet is in fact the obvious one and… can in fact be an academic while Queer and trans and ‘crippie’. It’s a thing that matters a lot to me, modelling that this is a thing that you can do. erm…’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  Ash’s narrative illustrates the importance of visibility of intersecting identities in the academy in order to facilitate a sense of belonging for everyone, and not just a particular type of student or staff. However, the lack of space to perform queerness in the academy had resulted in less ‘accepted’ visibility, hence it was argued that senior academic staff being visibly ‘out’ is an important factor in order to show acceptance of diversity among staff and aspiring PhD students. Queer visibility was, however, referred to as being in tension with the overall aim of universities to facilitate a business case towards inclusivity where queerness is constructed as being in tension with ‘professionalism’:   ‘… universities are selling themselves about how open and inclusive and diverse they are, right, it isn’t actually, by actually looking at the top levels, they are not very inclusive or diverse and so more, more action and less spin right, less talking and higher policies and look at … like doing more inclusiveness to marginalized backgrounds like would be much better. There are things that we can do like mentoring students I think could be really useful 132  erm and I don’t know, lots of stuff… less talk and more practical action. … it’s quite irritating for someone to sell themselves in one way or the other without actually not doing anything apart from saying how wonderful they are…’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  In the narrative above, Alice argued that diversity and equality in universities were constructed as a ‘selling point’ as part of the ‘business case agenda’ hence remained empty shells of promises that looked good on paper while not being incorporated in practice. This was also stressed by Brian who argued that although he considered himself as working for a ‘gay friendly’ employer ‘it internally is very, at least on paper anyways, very open about supporting its LGBTQ staff’. As such, Dorothy, Alice, Chloe and Bob argued that it was important for universities to foster diversity among staff identifying with various sexualities and genders, starting at the top level of the university:  ‘I would say have more diverse staff at the top of your, er, at the top of the organisation. I think we are starting to make some progress. We have a PVC who is openly lesbian which I think is good. And we have erm one or two people within the faculty that I’m in, that are openly LGBT which is really good, and are out there saying to students, ‘look, I’m LGBT. Deal with it.’ (Bob, self-identified gay man)  Bob further argued that increased visibility and support for LGBTQIA staff at the upper echelons of the University would, ideally, result in fostering a ‘come to work as you are’ approach whereby academics identifying with non-normative sexualities do not feel they have to leave their sexuality at the doorstep before going in to work. This was supported by Brian who argued that it was liberating working in an environment that facilitate diversity at all levels of the organisation. As such, Dorothy argued that visibly out professors or members of staff could facilitate a more inclusive environment for everyone, particularly junior members of staff that she know feel ‘that they can’t be out, and they can’t be themselves.’   However, being out and visible in the workplace was argued by Blair, who was an ‘out’ lesbian professor, as constructing her as an ‘outlier’ in the academy which did not bring about any benefits at work other than feeling ‘different’ which further reinforced a sense of being a minority. Blair therefore argued that she had a feeling that ‘in professional environments, the less people that know about you, the better’. However, Bob argued that although universities are ‘kind of like oil tankers, 133  they’re slow to change’, universities should send out the message that being ‘out’ is not an issue that ‘will begin to bring the diversity into the upper echelons of the University’. This is an important message in order for academics in the higher ranks of the academy to feel safe and secure to come out without feeling that they are jeopardising their position and knowledge as ‘valid’ as seen in Section 6.4.2. Additionally, ‘accepted visibility’, was also argued by Chloe as something that made it easier to bring queerness to work which she credited her university for bringing forward:   ‘… what we have here and what I think is really important is, there’s a, this comes from the very top and goes through all the different levels, this comes from the vice chancellor, our vice chancellor is openly erm gay  yet, she kind of, she kind of radiates and disseminates this unapologetic, which is really impressive for me, this unapologetic… embracing and endorsing of equality and diversity… and whenever we have equality and diversity campaigns she’s always in the picture, she sends ‘we participated in this LGBT championship workplace….’ (Chloe, self-identified gay woman)   The importance of visible role models celebrating diversity was also argued by Ash as something that facilitated a sense of belonging in the academy that further has the ability to queer the academy away from forced heteronormativity among staff and students:  ‘Getting to university and finding Queers who were consistently out as Queer and who I’d could hang out with is brilliant and having a senior tutor at my college whose a gay man and very out about it, that was brilliant … and getting to pay it forward is good and getting to… starting to get more a sense of having peers and people ahead of me who are Queer and trans is a really big deal to me.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  However, Alice argued that while she was aware about master’s students and PhD students that were ‘out and proud’ she felt that there was a ‘glass ceiling’ when it came to ‘queer’ professors and academic fellows as they were not ‘out’. Despite the lack of out queer academics at their workplace, Alice argued that she was ‘looking above that and thinking others are more like me in the academy’. However, LGBTQIA academics felt their opportunities to climb the academic ladder restricted when coming out, as LGBTQIA researchers was perceived as a niche group with peculiar research interests, as discussed in Section 6.4. As such, Doris argued that a survey conducted at 134  her university a couple of years ago ‘said that 40 per cent of queer staff were scared to come out’. The importance of acceptance and visibility was further stressed by Drew as a way of gaining support and recognition as viable academic members of staff, particularly visibility was constructed as a way of deconstructing academic heteronormativity while at the same time constructing a ‘queer’ right to belongingness in the academy:   ‘we can only get support if it’s visible that we’re there; so… and fundamentally, what you’re, you’re kind of always doing is trying to show that, you’re kind of, kind of saying you might live in a heteronormative world but actually we’re all here, we’ve been active in telling you that that’s a problem for us having to live in that world, to have to negotiate your world is sometimes hostile towards us.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace woman)  As such, visibility was argued to be important towards facilitating the coming out process for academics that are constructed within the academy as ‘having a sexuality’ in order to queer the academy away from assuming everyone fits within the heterosexual mould.   6.6.2 Support networks  Similarly to the importance of facilitating ‘visible queerness’ at the top of the echelons, Chloe argued that support networks for LGBTQIA academics should be an initiative stressed from the very top of the university and encouraged at all levels of the academy. However, participants stressed that more often than not LGBTQIA-identified academics where the ones that felt obliged to- and were implicitly expected to set up LGBTQIA networks. This reproduces the marginalised/non-marginalised binary of the academy rather than bringing everyone together as one organisation. It was thus thought it would be beneficial to include HR in the task of providing support networks, rather than being an extra job for academic staff that happen to identify as LGBTQIA:  ‘… “here is the appointed person in HR to talk to if you’ve got questions” or whatever. Having I suppose, having I suppose official diversity champions in the HR department whose job it is, who know this stuff and to educate staff about it… rather than having it be the second job of people who… have research to be getting on with, who do not… who are not getting paid to do equality and diversity work in addition to their teaching and research or what have you.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer) 135    However, the level of HR-involvement varied and its importance in supporting LGBTQIA people were argued by Drew, a self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman, to facilitate visibility and acceptance ‘to help us sort of put on events and erm get funding for different things which I don’t, and it’s, they sort of fully recognise us as a staff now’.  The importance of recognizing diversity in sexualities amongst academic staff was also argued by George, a self-identified bisexual man, as important in order for him to be ‘a little bit more willing to be an advocate for bisexuality’. However, the emphasis on support was argued by George to not be integrated in the academy as sexuality was still thought to be ‘absolutely fine as long as it is kept in its own corner’. Thus, in order to integrate genuine support for LGBTQIA academics into the functioning of the academy, it was suggested that straight allies could have an impact in challenging the normalcy of heteronormativity.   6.6.3 Straight Allies In order to challenge academic heteronormativity, participants argued that incorporating ‘straight allies’ to the endeavour would be a useful tool for organisational change. Tucker and Schroedinger recognised their own privilege in academia and argued that as heterosexual, white men in the academy they had power that ‘others do not have’. As such, Tucker argued ‘with power comes responsibility’. Abby further argued that ‘there is power in numbers’ whereby straight academics could act as change agents by speaking up about inequalities and ‘letting the people whose voices matter in these kind of situations be heard and then amplified’. Further, Brian argued that visible straight allies may have a powerful role in challenging heteronormativity:   ‘Well I think, I, I mean I don’t , yeah maybe it’s a thing about visibility if, if, if others see straight allies talking about equality… that’s quite powerful isn’t it? So maybe it’s, it’s a cultural influence that they might be able to wield.’ (Brian, self-identified gay man)  However, Caroline was cautious about ‘straight allies’ and argued they do not necessarily encompass inclusivity for all the diversity that exists, whereby she constructed being an ally to a ‘lesbian’ as accepted as it was ‘an easy one’, compared to trans*:    ‘Most of them are only fine to a certain extent; if I came out as trans they wouldn’t be fine anymore… Like it’s a difficult one, erm I think because there’s no… not much to get, like I 136  just like women that’s it.  That’s the easy one. So for them that is easy, it’s easy to be like an ally to me.’ (Caroline, self-identified lesbian woman)  Caroline, as seen in Section 6.2 identified as a ‘feminine lesbian’ which she argued made her experiences easier, compared to for example Blair who’s gender expression aligned more towards a ‘butch’ identity that was constructed as a more ‘visibly’ queer identification. As such, participants stressed the need for allies to support trans* academics, as Katie, Alex, Adam and Ash had overheard transphobic behaviours at work:  ‘Erm, there was one time when I was erm sitting you know, we were in a pub drinking with some fellow academics and one of them was erm talking about her cousin who had erm come out as trans, so was a trans woman. And she frequently like she just misgendered her, constantly, throughout the conversation. And at one point said, ‘Why couldn’t he just try being gay first?’ (Alex, self-identified bi/pan woman)  The statement provided by Alex illustrate the lack of knowledge and education about trans* issues that may cause, as in this case, ignorance. Ash, who identifies as genderqueer, argued that it would be useful to have accessible guidelines for academic staff, particularly for people identifying as trans* or non-binary as well as straight and cis allies:  ‘There can be, there could be… an actual, obvious pathway of support for HR for, and “this person is coming as PhD student want to come out as trans and here is what we’ll do to support them” erm… the university could make it absolutely certain that where preferred name is given and is different to the first name it could use the preferred name. it could have structures in place such that it’s actually possible to work out how to feed this information back to people erm… and how to effect change… even as the trans rep on the staff LGBT+ network I’ve got no idea who to talk to in order to actually get improvements made… erm… or how to get effective change.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  The lack of knowledge about who to contact and what to do in case of discrimination to receive support was an issue stressed by several of the participants. In particular, academic participants sought for universities to develop guidelines and educate people on discriminatory behaviours. For 137  example, Anthony, self-identifying as a gay man, stressed that because universities are presumed to be ‘inclusive liberal environments, I think it stops people actually labelling behaviours as homophobic, sexist, racist et cetera’. As such, Anthony, Alex and Anna argued that straight allies could cooperate with the LGBTQIA society and create guidelines that includes information of what constitutes homophobic, lesbophobic and biphobic behaviour. Anna, a self-identified bisexual woman, further argued that although she believed university guidelines were in place, these guidelines were not made easily available by the University, meaning that people do not know what to do in case of overhearing hate speech. Katie thus stressed an important question that universities should ask their staff: ‘what would you do in the event that you witnessed something that was discriminatory and do you feel equipped to kind of challenge that’. Grace, a self-identified bisexual woman, further argued that such guidelines should be incorporated as part of the academic equality and diversity agenda rather than being the responsibility of LGBTQIA academics to educate fellow academics.   The discussions above suggest more available information and education is needed for straight and cis allies to identify and recognize universities’ stance on hate speech and discrimination. For example, Drew argued that straight allies have a vital role in challenging academic heteronormativity as they can distance themselves from the emotional strains of explaining these issues:  ‘Er, yeah, so I, we do have a number of… I mean, I’ve personally come across a number of people who are really quite fierce allies and that helps enormously and the way that, the reason I think it helps is that they can kind of say ‘I’m here to tell other straight people about the kinds of things that are going on and the kinds of problems that are being caused by heteronormativity’ and ‘I can do it without feeling anger and emotion myself because I don’t identify that way.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace woman)  Additionally, Doris argued that universities and straight allies should be educated to ‘recognizing the extra needs that queer people have’. Queer needs included gender-neutral bathrooms, recognition of queer families, an understanding of gender and sexuality as fluid and non-binary without forcing people into boxes and the issues faced by trans people in relation to transitioning and need for time off work. For example, universities and straight/cis allies could stress the importance of acceptance towards gender-neutral pronouns rather than forcing people to identify 138  as ‘he’ or ‘she’:  ‘I find it equally is destructive to my like engagement and concentration on a text when they say ‘she’. It’s just kind of like, can you not just use ‘they’? Because obviously when you use ‘he’ or ‘she’ you’re still enforcing a gender binary and you’re still excluding some of your readers. Whilst your men readers might not have experienced some of that erm exclusion before and it might make them step up and think, there are still a whole bunch of you know gender-fluid or trans people who might not be sure what pronouns to use. Intersex people who you are still excluding from when you use you know a binary gender pronoun system.’  (Alex, self-identified bi/pan woman)  Ash had first-hand experience of being forced into rigid heteronormative boxes in the academy, and in particular within the department of STEM. Despite having come out as genderqueer, they were mistakenly read in the academy as ‘female’, which meant that they had to have lengthy discussions with fellow academics who continued to mis-pronoun them:  ‘So yeah, there’s going to be a lot of really patient, a lot of really patient explaining and erm… repetition and so on to have… and like I, I, I don’t want to distract from meetings with my supervisor or my head of group by every time I’m referred to as ‘she’, correcting them to ‘they’ and… but on the other hand I really do, that’s not a thing [that] I’ve done yet because I don’t want to make a meeting about my gender.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  As such, Caroline suggested that there could be an induction to get an overview of what gender ‘is’. For example, she suggested using the ‘genderbread thing’4 and explain that ‘some might use like ‘they’ and you know, and what to do when a student transitions, because I erm have sorority support from someone who’s just transitioned and like all the lecturers are still using the woman’s name, but he’s “Rob” now’. Adam, a self-identified gay man, further suggested that one way in which “straight” allies could participate in challenging heteronormativity is by looking at the curriculum that we are teaching that tends to silence LGBTQIA people and voices. The importance of “straight” allies in teaching was supported by Kaitlin, a self-identified bisexual woman, as vital in order to avoid expecting that the history of sexuality has to be done by queer historians. She                                            4 A genderbread-person is a graphic diagram/model which explains gender, sex and gender expression moving beyond biological sex. 139  further argued that the matching argument of leaving queer theory to self-identified queer academics would bolster a problem, which is ‘like leaving that issue like say about women’s history are with the responsibility of women’.  6.7 Conclusions This chapter is the first of two findings chapters aiming to present the findings from the current qualitative research involving UK academics identifying across the gender and sexuality spectrum. This chapter has discussed how academics navigate the academy where discourses of heteronormativity remains an implicit norm. The issues around heteronormativity were particularly evident in the participants’ constructions of sexuality as a private matter thus having to navigate academic contexts as assumed straight. The normativity of heterogender was also evident in how academics negotiated genders and sexualities in order to avoid causing trouble thus risk being ‘othered’ as non-legitimate academics.   In particular, findings show that contextual factors restricting academics to bring sexuality to work included new managerial practices that tended to disqualify associations with femininity and queer research, the normalcy around heterosexual scripts underlying the discursive construct of the nuclear family and the masculinization of the academy that facilitate ‘male’ academics’ interests and voices. The findings from this chapter also suggest non-binary identities were found to experience invisibility and experience further exclusion from the academy. Thus, focusing on discursive objects such as ‘bisexuality’ in particular, as well as ‘non-binary sexualities’, Chapter Seven presents the findings discussing how these subjectivities are further implicated by broader heteronormative discourses permeating UK academia.   140  Chapter 7 Discursive construction of non-binary sexualities  7.1 Introduction Having discussed and explored the ways in which ‘sexuality’, ‘gender’ and ‘academic identity’ are deployed and constructed by academics in Chapter Six, this chapter aims to explore whether non-binary sexualities (bisexual, queer and pansexual) draw on similar discursive constructs when talking about their sexuality, gender and academic identities. The decision to focus on these subjectivities, was because there is, as identified in the extant literature presented in Chapter Three and Four, a tendency to exclude non-binary sexual identities from queer theory. This results in erasure, which contributes with reinforcing binary thinking. Several of the current study’s participants mentioned issues around bierasure, for example Alice stated that:  ‘…I almost think it’s bizarre because queer theory right, about challenging the straight-gay divide… and it’s like, and you read it and you end up thinking how can you have this whole conversation about challenging the straight-gay divide and not even discuss bisexuality?’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  This chapter seeks to examine how academics identifying with non-binary sexualities, bisexuality in particular, understand their sexuality in relation to the hetero/homo binary and the ways in which this binary enables and constrains gendered and sexual subjectivities to be performatively enacted in the academy. Although the focus is on non-binary sexualities, bisexuality was a subject position with which the majority of the respondents self-identified. However, it is worth noting that when for example the term ‘bisexuals’ is used in the text, this is not to adopt an essentialist and unproblematic usage of the label, rather ‘bisexuals’ is referred to as a discursively constructed category. As such, in order to answer the research objective to ‘advance and apply queer theory’s performativity theory to understand how non-normative sexual and gendered practices ‘trouble’ gender and sexuality as stable categories to the study of non-binary sexualities’, Willig’s (2008; 2013) six steps Foucauldian discourse analysis was utilised. To start, the analysis found that the discursive object ‘bisexuality’ was constructed in two main ways:   1) As (in)visible whereby wider discourses relating to heteronormativity, cisnormativity and binarism constructs bisexuality as ‘transitory’ and ‘invisible’ in the academy.  141  2) As ‘radical’ whereby bisexuality was constructed as a way of deconstructing hetero and cis-normativity, whereby various non-binary sexualities became available including ‘queer’ and ‘pansexual’, which was associated with taking up a radical position at work.  This chapter thus includes an examination of the positions available in these constructs which includes ‘assumed straight’, ‘gay’, or ‘lesbian’ when bisexuality is constructed as (in)visible. However, when constructed as ‘radical’, more subject positions and possibilities for action is available by taking on ‘queer’ or ‘pansexual’ identities in addition to ‘bisexuality’. The two main constructs of bisexuality as ‘invisible’ and ‘radical’ will be discussed below in relation to the other steps to illustrate how ‘bisexuality’ is constructed and its implications for research.   7.2 Discursive construct of bisexuality as (in)visible 7.2.1 Bisexuality as ‘a step’ towards one end of the binary In order to discuss how self-identified bisexual academics navigate academia as ‘invisible’, this section will start with presenting the analysis relating to how participants constructed the discursive object ‘bisexuality’. Charlotte, Doris, Alice, George, Kaitlin, Ash, Abby, Alex, Grace, Anna and Drew identified as ‘bisexual’ academics when discussing their sexuality making 11 out of 30 participants. The participants above referred to discourses of binarism and ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ relating to heteronormativity when constructing ‘bisexuality’. For example, Abby argued that due to heteronormativity discourses she had at some point believed she had to be either “straight or gay”:  A  …Er… my sexuality was a little bit of a discovery process. Er, I went to an all girl school erm for like the entirety of my life… Q  mm A  … And I’ve kind of through most of my teenage years, kind of any real person I’m actually interested in was female Q  yeah A  um so I was like, ‘I’m probably gay’, and then left that school and met someone who was not a female, erm and went, ‘am I still gay? No I’m not anymore’, and then kind of at that point I just kind of stopped caring (Abby, self-identified bisexual woman)  142  In Abby’s narrative, she positioned herself in available categories constructed by and through heteronormativity whereby she argued that she could either occupy a gay or straight subject position depending on the gender of the person she was seeing, resulting in erasure of sexualities somewhere in the middle of the binary. This illustrates how heteronormativity was constructed in Abby’s narrative to position gayness in opposition to straightness whereby sexualities somewhere on the spectrum are depicted as non-viable sexualities until she ‘stopped caring’, whereby ‘bisexual’ became an available subject position. Abby further constructed bisexuality as an indication that ‘I am open to having sexual or rom, and/or romantic relationships with people of all, every gender’.  Similarly, Anna, Grace, Alice and Drew also stated that coming to terms with ‘bisexuality’ was a discovery process that was often referred to as a negotiation between straight and gay sexualities hence drawing upon wider discourses around binary identity to talk bisexuality into existence. An example of such a negotiation is provided by Anna:  A  um, it means that I’m attracted to like men and women like… non-binary people as well, whereas I’ve experienced that I’m mostly attracted to men and women erm yeah, at the moment I’m not that interested, I’m more interested in women than men at the moment but it still feels as if I’m bi so Q  yeah. And have you always identified as such? A  um, I don’t know about always so I, I first came, I knew I wasn’t straight since maybe about 14, 15 erm kind of at that time I wondered if I was gay or straight or whatever, and I sort of settled at bi Q  mm A  where I feel most comfortable even though I, I feel my sexuality sort of shifts and moves a bit… (Anna, self-identified bisexual woman)  Negotiating heteronormativity and binarism, Anna constructed bisexuality as a ‘process of becoming’ that continues to be open for re-citation rather than a stable ‘end point’ identification. Although Anna constructed bisexuality as an attraction towards women, men and non-binary people she was ‘more interested in women than men at the moment’ and still positioned herself as bisexual despite hetero- and homonormativity’s attempts to make her choose one end of the binary. However, by stating ‘I feel my sexuality sort of shifts and moves a bit’, Anna constructs bisexuality as a fluid sexuality, an identification that might change in the future. On the other hand, Grace argued that ‘being bisexual’ means she is equally attracted to men and women although most of 143  her relationships have been with men. Rather than being an either/or identification, Abby and Anna, positioning themselves as ‘bisexual’, argued that they were romantically and sexually attracted to people of all genders rather than normative expectations of being attracted to either men or women. However, Grace constructed ‘bisexuality’ as binary whereby she made reference to ‘women or men’ rather than all genders. Identifying as bisexual does not, however, mean that people have to be equally attracted to one specific gender expression, but as seen in Anna and Grace’s narratives, it is possible to be more attracted to one gender expression and still identify as ‘bi’.   Additionally, Drew, a self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman, negotiated her identity in relation to the bi-erasing binary that attempted to make her identity (in)visible within the dominant hetero/homonormative discourses. In her early twenties, Drew believed ‘I was either gay or straight because of who I was attracted to’ and further argued ‘I didn’t really use the word bisexual about myself until I was in my 40s because I didn’t have enough information about it’. Echoing Anna and Abby’s reflection on negotiating and deconstructing the hetero/homo binary in order to find space to identify as bisexual, Drew had also questioned whether she was ‘gay or straight’ depending on who she was attracted to. However, due to the limited information available around non-binary identities, bisexuality was constructed as a recent sexual identity discourse that historically had been concealed by the forces of heteronormativity that tries to marshal ‘bisexuals’ into a straight or gay identity, which was also referred to by Grace as being the case in the academy:   ‘um I think particularly being bisexual so… you know, if you’re in a relationship with a man erm… people see you as heterosexual, if you’re in a relationship with a woman, they see you as lesbian. erm so you’re constantly having to come out and explain yourself and yeah it get’s a bit tiring and boring sometimes, having to do that, so I don’t always bother [laughs].’ (Grace, self-identified bisexual woman)  Discussing ‘bisexuality’ in the academic discourse and in relation to her workplace experience as bisexual, Grace argues that the assumptions that people are either straight or lesbian is a constant negotiation for ‘bisexuals’ due to its (in)visibility at work. As such, coming out as ‘bisexual’ means Grace would have to explain bisexuality to her academic colleagues, which meant that she sometimes decided to not come out of the ‘bisexual closet’. However, Ash, a self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer found it difficult discussing being in a polyamorous relationship 144  within STEMM as it diverged from the heterosexual, normative couple relationship of ‘compulsory monogamy’:  ‘… so I am very, very aware of when… that my colleagues are entirely happy to just say “oh, I’m spending the weekend with partner or… ‘I want to let you all know that I got engaged’ or… and ‘we’re going on a trip or whatever”, whereas I feel… that I can’t go… I can’t talk about… I have to talk about doing things with friends rather than partners, I feel that erm… for, what would otherwise be a similar level of detail erm like I can’t say… they are aware that I have a boyfriend, but I cant say ‘oh I’m going to visit my other partner in Stockholm’ or ‘oh I’m spending the weekend in Bristol with… my other partner…  who is genderqueer’ without inviting a lot of questions basically because… ignorance and curiosity, but in a way that feels like…’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  However, Ash could not come out as ‘queer’ in a polygamous relationship without ‘inviting a lot of questions’ due to the lack of knowledge of queer relationships. The emotional labour associated with explaining ‘bisexuality’ in the academic context was also referred to by Drew, who argued that people would actively try to ‘shut me down’ and tell her that ‘bisexuality doesn’t exist’, which creates ‘a lot of hurt and anger sometimes’. Thus, drawing upon bi-erasure and binarism in the context of academia, Drew constructs coming out as bisexual as a second job by having to justify and explain bisexuality in order to legitimise ‘bisexuality’ as a valid sexuality. Alice also reflected on the process of ‘becoming’ bisexual in relation to other peoples’ expectations around binaries where straight, lesbian and gay are constructed as ‘speakable’ subject identifications, which renders bisexuality ‘unspeakable’:  ‘I think… early teen… and I called myself bicurious for a while before identifying as bisexual and I had a big lesbian crisis when I was like at university and called myself gay for a while but then I just came back to it (bisexual) so yeah pretty much… I feel like, I think it’s kind of, people constantly tell you that you are confused or that you’re erm… you’re really gay or really straight.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  Alice’s narrative illustrate how heteronormativity is perceived to create binaries between straightness and queerness, whereby people are forced to identify as either a heterosexual man /woman or a gay man/woman whereby two genders and two sexualities are available for people to 145  occupy. Additionally, Alice depicted bisexuality as perceived by others, including academic colleagues, as ‘indecisive’ or ‘confused’. For example, Dorothy, a self-identified gender-neutral lesbian stressed that they had heard biphobic and transphobic remarks within the lesbian community where trans women are constructed as non-women and ‘bisexuals’ are perceived as not ‘queer’:   A ... I mean most bisexual women keep quiet about being bisexual because they get biphobia from the lesbian community as well as from the heterosexual community and it’s, it’s not a, it’s not great at all. And however hard you try to explain that, you know, ‘bisexuality is probably the most sensible position to be where you know, you have relationships with a person irrespective of what gender they are’.  Q  yeah A  and nobody, you know, they just, they still keep persisting on talking about ‘oh they ought to make their minds up’… No, why should they make their minds up? …Why, why does it have to be either this or that? (Dorothy, self-identified gender-neutral lesbian)   In the narrative provided by Dorothy, bisexuality was constructed within the lesbian community as a transitory sexuality, as a step on the way, to become either straight or gay. When bisexuality is constructed by people positioned as belonging to intelligible categories as ‘ought to make their minds up’, bisexuality is silenced and constructed as a questionable or a non-legitimate sexuality on their way towards a stable identity on one side of the binary.  When perceived in this way, Alice argued that she had felt pressured to question whether or not she could choose to identify as ‘bisexual’ as an intelligible subject position and thought ‘okay what if I’m actually wrong what if I’m actually lying and this is not my identity’. Other people’s perceptions and construction of ‘bisexuality’ were reflected upon in the participants’ narratives whereby norms are internalised in their constructions of how they perceive ‘bisexuality’ and what this identification means to them. While Anna, Alice, Grace and Drew argued that they had felt pressured to occupy either a straight or a gay/lesbian identity, George compared himself to his brother who identifies as a gay man working in ‘hard sciences’. However, working in education, which George argued is ‘not hyper-masculine’, he constructed ‘bisexuality’ as a discourse making his academic experience ‘easier’:  146  ‘I feel that I potentially had it a little easier…. As someone who can pass as someone who… I mean bisexuality is… is… a hidden sexuality for many different reasons, it doesn’t have to be so open and often people assume er… you’re one way or the other based on what partner you have or how they know you… erm so it is something that I, as I say, and continually keep behind the doors, so I feel that it has helped me in that way, in that it erm…. It allows me to be attached straight.’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  Here George constructs bisexuality as an ‘invisible’ or ‘hidden’ sexuality in the academy whereby the perceived or assumed straightness associated with bisexuality allows him to ‘be attached straight’ and navigate academia as “straight”. Additionally, bisexuality is constructed in George’s narrative as a ‘private identity’ that he ‘continually keep behind the doors’, which is conditioned by the academic culture that seeks to (re)produce heteronormative thinking and privileges as seen in Section 6.5 of the preceding chapter. Although George constructs his experience navigating academia as bisexual ‘easier’ compared to his brother, ‘passing’ as straight means George cannot bring bisexuality ‘to work’, constructing bisexuality as a private sexuality. The discourse discussed above offers the subject positions of an assumed straight, indecisive and invisible sexuality whereby the participants can only ‘choose’ to identity as either straight or gay. This further serves to render bisexuality as a ‘step on the way’ towards one end of a binary where they are forced to be read as having a sexuality (taking up a lesbian or gay subject position) or seen as not having a sexuality (passing as “straight”).   7.2.2 Negotiating (in)visibility in the academy: constructing the bisexual closet It was evident from the discussion above that non-binary sexualities not fitting ‘in’ at either side of the heteronormative binary were invisible in the academy. By occupying a bisexual subject position, participants were reflexively deconstructing the power of heteronormativity that forces people to identify as monosexual, as seen in Anna, Alice, George, Ash, Grace and Abby’s narratives. Paradoxically, by doing so, heteronormativity attempts to (re)enforce its power by assuming people to be “straight” or ‘gay’ depending on the relationship people were in, which constructs a discourse of a metaphorical ‘bisexual closet’. Within the academic context, George drew upon discourses of heteronormativity in arguing that by passing as “straight” he could navigate the academic culture with the privilege underpinning heterosexuality:   147  ‘I have a lot of…. being a white ‘male’ in academia, means I can move through these spaces with sort of an assumption that, that maybe I am straight… I think people in this department, because I don’t really talk to people about it, (they) think that I am straight, I am married I…. erm…. I… I…. I’ve never really talked to people in the department about my sexuality, so I think it’s something that I consider a large part of who I am but something obviously other people do not consider a part of who I am, or might not be aware of. It’s an aspect of myself.’ (George, self-identified bisexual man)  Navigating academia as a straight passing man, George constructed bisexuality as belonging to the ‘private sphere’ whereas ‘straightness’ is a doing that can be performed in the academy due to its normalcy and privilege.  Similarly to George who works in the education department, Drew argued that, within the context of education, ‘bierasure is still a problem’ and she could not be ‘authentic’ if she did not correct colleagues’ heteronormative assumptions that everyone is ‘straight unless they are told otherwise’:  ‘… I struggle a lot with that and I think that, I think that queer people have to negotiate the world differently because it’s a world that is, it’s not hostile, just ignorant about how, what it might feel like, what it might be to negotiate a world that is so heteronormative.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman)  As such, ‘staying in’ the bisexual closet in the academy could facilitate the possibility to pass as “straight” hence (re)produce the assumption of academia as a ‘sexually neutral’ workplace. However, not correcting people’s assumptions would mean that people could not bring bisexuality to work. To illustrate how ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ is taken for granted in the academic context, Alice reflected on an experience of one of her colleagues who, despite researching LGBT issues was assumed straight:   ‘… and that really upset her, because she had this kind of conversation and she said that “how can you say that as a straight woman”, and she was there like thinking in her head that “I am not straight”, and that presumption really hurt her, she was really upset about it.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  148  This demonstrates the danger of assuming people to be straight by default as Alice’s colleague felt silenced and her opportunity to come out was removed. Additionally, Alex, Drew, Abby, Alice and Grace drew upon wider discourses around community and belonging to discuss bisexuality that was further linked to stereotyping and (in)visibility. Echoing George’s sentiment of bisexuality being tied to straightness and its underpinning gendered assumptions, Alex, working in the classics department, did not feel able to come out of the ‘bisexual closet’ in the academy:   ‘Um, it just kind of feels a bit… I think that’s kind of one of the reasons why I don’t really feel part of like an LGBTQIA or MOGAI [Marginalised orientations, gender alignments and intersex] community. erm, especially because you get that other stuff like, ‘Oh, well, if you’re bi but in a heterosexual relationship then you don’t really count as queer’. erm, and I’m not out to my family. So a lot of the time I do kind of feel like, ‘Well, I’m spending a lot of time benefitting from other people’s assumption of my straightness’ and I do feel bad about that.’ (Alex, self-identified bi/pan woman)  Alex thus argued that coming out in a queer space, such as LGBTQIA and MOGAI communities, did not facilitate the coming out process. However, coming out in queer spaces was rather perceived to leave ‘bisexuals’ with two choices: either to go back into the ‘closet’ or make a ‘choice’ to identify as ‘lesbian’ to gain validity and to legitimize their ‘queerness’. By not being out to her family, Alex’s assumed and perceived straightness was constructed as intertwined with the privilege associated with ‘normalcy’. Within queer or straight spaces, such as LGBTQIA communities and academic networks, bisexuality was constructed as a ‘non-existing sexuality’ and saying ‘I’m bisexual’ was rendered unsayable:  A Yes, I still get that. I had one not that long ago actually, erm, when someone had decided to say this and they said it was a friend of theirs that said it [bisexuality] didn’t exist and it’s clearly not a friend of theirs that said it and just hiding behind it and also them saying that they had gay friends who said it didn’t exist as well which, you know, also happens I’m sad to say, in the LGBTQ community. There are some gay people who just don’t like people who are bisexual and I’ve certainly, certainly had situations where when I’ve come out as bisexual to gay people and they’ve kind of, ‘Oh well, don’t worry, you’ll be lesbian soon.’ Q Really? 149  A I have had that… It’s not always explicit, sometimes it’s just, you know, ‘now you’ve met this whole bunch of lesbian women you will find someone soon that suits you better’ [laughs]. Q Yeah, so they kind of create the binary again, yeah. A Yeah, so, you know, you sort of have to negotiate those sort of straight people’s expectations and gay people’s expectations and you have to sort of move through a world that is, yeah, just wants to recreate that binary and preferably into straight people. (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman)  Similar to Alex, Drew’s narrative illustrates how bisexuality is constructed by people in the LGBTQIA community as a transitory phase on the way to becoming either ‘lesbian’ or “straight”. For example, by having others stating ‘don’t worry you’ll be lesbian soon’, saying ‘I’m bisexual’ is perceived as controversial and Drew is thus coming out into an illegitimate sexuality that should not be spoken about. Further, by saying ‘I’m bisexual’, the opportunity to legitimize this subject position is taken away from her by being told that ‘bisexuality does not exist’. As such, norms constructed within the dominant straight society relating to compulsory heterosexuality and homonormativity creating knowledge as to what counts as ‘queer enough’ to facilitate a sense of belonging in the LGBTQIA community, is perceived as a continuous battle for people identifying with non-binary sexualities. Drew also refers to ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ as integrated within society to ‘produce’ and convert ‘bisexuals’ ‘into straight people’. It is thus evident that bisexuality is constructed by others as ‘indecisive’ hence a subject position that can ‘easily’ be converted into intelligible, thus stable sexualities such as ‘gay’, ‘lesbian’ or “straight”. By drawing on discourses such as heteronormativity and homonormativity, participants perceived ‘bisexuality’ as a step on the way within these discourses, that was in tension with self-identified ‘bisexuals’ construction of bisexuality.   Furthermore, by neither being constructed as ‘queer enough’ (Alex and Alice) nor ‘straight enough’ (Drew), ‘bisexuals’ have to negotiate expectations that may force people back into the closet. As such, the power relations between ‘straight and everything else queer’ is constructed to not include bisexual and non-binary sexualities, as people are forced to hide in the bisexual closet until they can ‘make their minds up’ (Dorothy) and come out as either straight or gay. The construction of bisexual relationships as (in)visible thus makes it difficult to locate ‘bisexuality’ compared to lesbian, gay and straight relationships where Grace argued that living with a man 150  means she is read as heterosexual by default, which serves to reinforce binarism. Grace thus argued that people ‘probably wouldn’t think about bisexuality as a possibility, (it) doesn’t seem to come into many peoples’ minds really’.  As such, ‘reading’ or ‘locating’ bisexuality is perceived as difficult due to the lack of ‘acts’ (such as holding hands or kissing people of ‘opposite gender’) that makes bisexuality visible. Binarism therefore works to erase ‘bisexuality’. As such, when bisexuality is constructed as hidden, invisible and not a possibility (Grace), it means that bisexuality is thought to be a silenced subject position. For example, Alice argued that ‘being’ bisexual, for her, implies navigating the academy and community as (in)visible:   A … it means most of my community are hidden and don’t come out to people  Q  yeah….  A  it means also that a lot of people come out to me and are, people secretly come out to me from all sides of the spectrum, you know, gay men come out to me and are secretly bisexual, as well as heterosexual people, and… so that is really nice, but really sad as well because they don’t feel they can be properly out… (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  Without any consensus as to what bisexuality ‘is’, the stigma associated with the label, and by removing the voices of the people identifying as such, people are afraid to come out as bisexual without causing trouble while paradoxically ‘benefitting’ from occupying a perceived stable ‘gay’, ‘lesbian’ or assumed “straight” identity (Alice). Drawing on her experience within the academic workplace, Drew echoed Alice’s narrative about how people are ‘secretly bisexual’ and stressed this was a consequence of heteronormativity that works to assume people to be straight and cisgender by default:   ‘…the way they just look at the world and assume everyone to be cis and straight …still only about just over one out of 10 bisexual women actually proclaim they are bisexual and that is in the best workplaces. I genuinely think the reason for that is because they just see people constantly talking about being straight and that that is just the norm and assuming everyone to be straight …’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman)  151  Self-identified bisexual people who are in relationships with someone read or passing as the ‘opposite gender’ might thus not be regarded as ‘queer enough’ in the academy by virtue of being read as complying with heteronorms. Drawing on the academic discourse of heteronormativity and community, Anna had experienced being forced into the ‘closet’ at work when a colleague questioned bisexual as a ‘valid’ sexuality:  ‘the only thing I felt, was slightly uncomfortable about was when the older, gay woman who’s in a relationship with another woman, in the beginning of the year made a comment about a lot of the LGBT society people being like bisexual women dating men, ‘oh that’s not the same’ erm… and I get where she was coming from but it felt very, a bit uncomfortable just having come out from a relationship with a man and I didn’t quite feel able to say that.’ (Anna, self-identified bisexual woman)  Challenging the validity of ‘women dating men’s’ identification with bisexuality causes additional distress, silence and emotional labour for bisexual people having to justify and explain their sexuality in order to be validated as ‘queer’ enough in the academy. Additionally, within the academic context, passing as (in)visible and sexually ‘neutral’ means that queer researchers are not perceived as ‘queer enough’ to do sexuality research whereby both their identities and research interests are constructed as ‘invalid’. By arguing that bisexuality is ‘very marginalized within sexuality research and LGBT research’, Alice stressed that bisexual academics are viewed as ‘not really queer enough to do queer research’. Hence, by not being perceived as being intelligibly queer to conduct queer research (Alice) or queer enough to participate in academic LGBT networks (Alex and Anna), bisexual academics reported exclusion from the academy whereby Alice argued bisexuality was constructed as an ‘outcast community’. Whereas Alice, Alex, Drew and Anna argued that LGBTQIA societies and networks in academia are ‘bi-exclusionary’, Grace constructed the LGBTQIA community as a ‘natural home’ where she can avoid being read as “straight”. Having conducted research on ‘LGBT issues’, Grace argued that going to ‘LGBT events or groups or meeting’ provides her with ‘a joyful life’.  As such in conducting research on same-sex parenting at work and participating in LGBT communities, Grace could move away from people assuming her to be “straight” where she argued ‘interestingly, a lot of the time, if people make assumptions about me, they would assume I am a lesbian’. Grace’s quote illustrate how doing LGBT research rendered her queerness sayable. 152  However, rather than perceived “straight” she was perceived to be ‘lesbian’ which, paradoxically, still renders bisexuality as an unsayable, unthinkable and (in)visible identity. This invisibility in the academy was further constructed in relation to wider discourses around traditional femininity and masculinity, which will be discussed in the next section.   7.2.3 Negotiating gender and sexuality as (in)visible in the academy  Navigating academia through an (in)visible discourse was found to render ‘bisexuals’ perceived to comply with heteronorms where enacting gender within normative frames was thought to mean ‘passing as straight’. As such, this section will discuss how bisexuality constructs, deconstructs and reconstructs gender in ways to appear ‘normal’ by drawing on wider discourses of traditional femininity and masculinity, belonging and community and academic culture in order to expose heteronormative practices. As seen in sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2, participants referred to ‘butch’ and ‘camp’ identities when negotiating femininity and masculinity in academia in order to (re)construct gendered identities. However, due to the lack of stereotypes and assumptions as to what a bisexual person ‘looks like’, participants drew upon discourses of (in)visibility and normative views on gender to discuss bisexuality through the lens of heteronormativity and cisnormativity:  ‘Um, I think there are sort of expectations about what erm lesbian and gay people especially should look like. I think there do tend to be expectations that erm trans women need to be hyper-feminine to prove that they’re trans women and the same for trans men. They need to be hyper-masculine to prove erm their identity. I do kind of feel like yeah, there’s… almost basically unless there’s something about your dress that is coded to indicate to the rest of society that you’re queer, erm, people will still just assume that you’re straight. Especially with bisexual people, that kind of ties into the, ‘No, you’re just straight people’ erm, thing.’ (Alex, self-identified bi/pan woman)  Alex draws on normative views on gender policed through heterosexuality whereby trans* women need to ‘be hyper-feminine to prove that they are trans women’ while trans men need to be hyper-masculine. As such, in order to be read as ‘women’, trans women have to ‘do’ gender in accordance with heterosexual femininity to be read as “straight” (Butler, 1999). Alex further stressed that she did not ‘fit in’ at the University’s LGBT society for staff as her friend in classics, who also identifies as bisexual, ‘got turned away from one of their meetings, at the door, because she looked too straight ‘. Rather than reading femme enactments of gender as ‘bisexual’, Alex’s friend was 153  excluded from participating in the academic LGBT society by looking ‘too straight’, which restricted Alex from partaking in the network fearing being assumed “straight”. However, drawing on his academic workplace experience, George ‘used’ the privilege associated with his assumed straightness, as it was interlinked with being read as a man. This was evident when George reflected on the expectations underpinning gender and sexuality that he felt he had to comply with by drawing on the discourse of heteronormativity and masculinity within the academic culture:   A  um yes! I’m yeah, I do… erm… particularly in terms of sexuality… I feel like the reason why I don’t mention my bisexuality is because er I feel the… I mean I am sure that I would be supported here but I feel the need to sort of conform in that traditional sense to just live up to the presumption that I am straight.  Q  yeah…  A after thought, it might be perceived strange because I am married and settled… er… for it to become, I mean… as I said, I consider it to be a large part of my identity, but for it to become a way of how other people (are) thinking about me, I feel it would change the way they think about me or the way they treat me, and I am not sure why… I mean, that’s my own hang-ups rather than this department that has been nothing but supportive. But… erm… I do feel a need to keep that under act… and to act “straight” as it were, to act heterosexual… (George, self-identified bisexual man)  In this narrative, George is concerned how fellow academic colleagues in the education department would treat him if he came out as bisexual. Here George draws upon the discourses of (in)visibility and normative expectations associated with heterogender whereby being married is tied to normative assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that is (re)produced within academia as ‘normal’. By mentioning being married to his academic colleagues, George argued that coming out as bisexual would be ‘perceived strange’ as this might mean losing power and privilege associated with being read as ‘male’ and ‘academic’ hence passing as “straight”. In this construction, being married and identifying as bisexual is constructed as impossible without ‘troubling’ and questioning the stability and privilege of heterosexual masculinity in the academy. When asked what kind of identity work George negotiated to ‘act straight’ in the academy he drew upon strict stereotypical views of masculinity:   154  A  um…it’s often things like when I am with the other male academics around here erm… talking about things that I consider to be potentially more straight-friendly. So erm… for example, as I just said, I watch a lot of rugby, so I talk to them about rugby Q  yeah…  A  or… erm… about… I don’t know, violent TV shows or stupidly, traditionally, very manly things we often talk about, those things that come up, as I say because I am just opposite of the kitchen, we have conversations about these… a lot of the men come to me to talk about these very manly things around traditionally, mainly straight domains of rugby and violent movies… and sometimes they talk about…. (Sights)… some of the students as well… you know…. How attractive they think the students are sometimes, which you know, I… I… don’t… it’s a very horrible thing to have to engage with that conversation, or to have that kind of conversation forced upon you… (George, self-identified bisexual man)  Rather than denaturalising heterosexuality, George’s narrative illustrates the repetitive acts involved in (re)producing heterosexual masculinity in academia as ‘normal’ behaviour of ‘male’ academics to avoid being read as ‘gay’ or ‘bisexual’. In this narrative, heteronormativity is prevalent in guiding interactions with fellow male colleagues where to ‘pass’ as a ‘straight man’ hence ‘ideal academic’, as seen in Section 6.4.1, George engaged in strict gendered scripts associated with heterosexual masculinity such as rating the attractiveness of women, rugby and violent TV shows. Despite wanting to deconstruct these stereotypical masculine norms in the academy, and ‘obscure the normative behaviour’, George argued that he is ‘still subject to other people’s expectations as to how I should act and interact and perform gender’.   The reasons behind negotiating acceptable gender norms was because George argued that ‘there is a lot of power with being straight passing and being a white male, and I feel that I might lose some of that power’ at work. He further argued that because academia reproduces and transmits normative ideas around heterosexual masculinity as the ‘ideal’ way of being an academic, ‘I feel that for a career in academia, it is potentially to my advantage to not be so openly bisexual’. Although bisexuality has the possibility to deconstruct binaries such as straight/gay and man/woman, heteronormative powers and knowledge permeated through the academy pressures ‘bisexuals’ to accept the expectations constructed by the ‘norm’. Thus, Abby, a self-identified bisexual woman, argued as ‘people know what to expect when you’re straight, people know what 155  to expect when you’re gay’, we have to accept that the expectations around ‘people who are kind of in the middle’ are more uncertain. Paradoxically, the invisibility of bisexuality means that unless bisexual academics adapt masculine norms associated with butch identities, hence read as ‘lesbian’, they were thought to be perceived as “straight” in the academy when complying with traditional views of femininity (Drew). To avoid being read as “straight”, Anna felt she ‘ought to dress gayer’ and constructed clothing as a discourse rendering her sexuality visible:  A  … I want to serve my identity in a recognizable way and like my haircut, like, I was thinking to grow my hair longer again and I’d had my hair short hair for six, seven years, sometimes I think about growing it longer again and partly because I don’t want to go through the parts of growing it out and then I’ll probably just cut it short again. And then parts of me is also like having short hair is one of the few ways of sort of recognizable…non-conforming, and I’m not straight so like I probably want to keep it in that… and again, like clothing everyone think like… I feel like I’m not… chosen and necessarily express my identity as strongly as I might like them to Q  yeah. In what ways do you think with regards to clothing? A  I don’t know… I just, I used to have, I used, when I was younger I dressed in quite overtly butch ways, I don’t really now but I sort of sometimes feel like… yeah, I’d like to… try out again more kind of masculine, straight butch style fashions… (Anna, self-identified bisexual woman)  Negotiating sexuality and gender through (in)visibility meant that Anna was often perceived as straight unless she cut her hair short or wear more ‘butch style fashions’. Thus, short hair was constructed as a signifier of a gay and non-conforming identity where long hair was constructed as conforming to heterosexual femininity. Anna demonstrates how gender may follow from sexuality, where passing as “straight” is associated with performing femininity whereas ‘gayness’ requires adapting to masculine norms. However, although butch masculine hairstyles and dress can be embodied to signify a ‘non-straight’ identity, these stereotypes and expectations of what constitutes a “straight” and ‘gay’ identity reinforce the non-existence of a visible bisexual identity. For example, Kaitlin, a self-identified bisexual woman, argued that although she felt pressured to conform to a ‘boyish look’ as an undergraduate she realised ‘that’s just conforming to different sort of set of rules about what queer women look like and then I was like ‘okay I’m not going to do that anymore’.  156   Rather than abiding to strict butch/camp and masculine/feminine genders, Kaitlin argued that non-binary sexualities might deconstruct the rigid norms and perform an interplay between these constructions. However, as noted by Alex, abiding to norms around heterogender means ‘bisexuals’ will be read as either straight (feminine) or lesbian/gay (butch/camp) and not bisexual. As seen in Section 6.2, bisexual women referred to sexism when constructing themselves as ‘women’, which was referred to as an intersection of ‘bisexuality’ and ‘woman’. For example, Anna argued that ‘being’ a woman is defined in  relation to how society treat her ‘like being a woman is partly defined by gender oppression and gendered societal structures like…so I guess I like, I am a woman in that I am treated’. Additionally, Alice argued ‘as a bisexual woman, a lot of my discrimination that I have perceived has been an intersection of my womanhood and bisexuality, so those identities are important to me’. Alice further argued that identifying as bisexual ‘means being more sexualised by men’:  ‘So it means, it means feeling unsafe and unwelcomed in LGBT spaces, it means discrimination from lesbian and gay people… some people are talking about LGBT but they are not really talking about you, they are just talking about gay men often and it means higher sexual assault statistics, like pressure… being pressured to perform group sex or confirm your sexuality for men erm, particularly. erm it just… comes with a lot of barriers…’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  The study found ‘feminine bisexuals’ who ‘resist’ the heterosexual label perceived themselves to be further stigmatised and subjected to sexism as a consequence of conforming to heterosexual ideals of femininity but paradoxically avoiding the subordination to men. Similarly, Drew argued that academic colleagues in the education department read her as “straight” when mentioning her ‘husband’, however, correcting them meant she felt more sexualised as a bisexual woman:    ‘… Do I correct them?’ In which case I have to… have this whole conversation in which they then suddenly start to think about bisexuality and what I do in the bedroom or, and then sometimes I even get to the point where they’re like, ‘Bisexuality doesn’t really exist, does it?’ which happens unfortunately.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman)  157  As such, passing as “straight” is perceived and read as ‘doing’ gender in the academy, however, doing gender and identifying as ‘bisexual’ is seen as causing gender trouble (Butler, 1999).  However, Charlotte, a self-identified bisexual trans woman, argued that the street harassment and sexism she experienced by men was perceived as a way of ‘validating’ her identity as ‘female passing’ rather ‘than trans’, which ‘bizarrely, I can get some validation out of it… because at least they are seeing you being seen as female’. As such, bisexual women were expected to conform to normative ideals of femininity in the academy, however, in doing so might be subjected to harassment and exclusion from the gay/straight communities. The discussion above demonstrates bisexuality is accepted as long as it follows heterosexual norms as it assumes ‘straightness’ and ‘invisibility’ of sexuality, although there is a risk of being sexualised. Bisexuality, when perceived as (in)visible, was, however, not perceived by the participants as ‘radical’ enough as a stand-alone category to rupture academic heteronormativity. The next section will show how participants deconstructed the heterosexual norms associated with femininity and masculinity, biological sex and queering the monosexuality linked with ‘bisexual’, by drawing upon categories such as ‘queer’ and ‘pansexual’ in addition to ‘bisexuality’. Additionally, a few participants avoided drawing on ‘bisexuality’ to position themselves, which also will be discussed to illustrate how non-normative sexualities were also constructed as ‘radical’.   7.3 Discursive construct of bisexuality as ‘radical’ 7.3.1 Bisexuality as the ‘unsayable’: avoiding the bisexual category Whereas Section 7.2.1 found that self-identified bisexual participants negotiated expectations relating to binary identities, some self-identified gay, straight and lesbian participants constructed their sexualities as ‘fluid’ while paradoxically avoiding positioning themselves as ‘bisexual’. This could be due to the stigma associated with ‘bisexuality’, as Alice and Drew argued in Section 7.2 people were ‘secretly bisexual’. The discussion below seeks to discuss how bisexuality was constructed as an ‘unsayable’ identity, which perpetuates silencing of academic bisexuals in the workplace as people are avoiding identifying as bisexual due to misinterpretations. For example, Abigail constructed herself as ‘straight with bisexual experiences’ and even though she has not ruled out having ‘bisexual experiences again’, she did not position herself as ‘bisexual’ or had come out as ‘bisexual’ in the academic context. Although Eric did identify as bisexual when he was younger, he now avoided the label ‘bisexual’ and rather identified himself as a ‘hetero-asexual’ academic. When asked what being ‘hetero-asexual’ meant to Eric, he drew upon language of ‘fluidity’ in that he was attracted to both men and women: 158   ‘Yes. I like women in general; I’m not averse to the idea of a relationship with a man, but I do not enjoy sex. So, visually, I’m more attracted to women’s looks, company and erm presence than I am to men, but just don’t… I don’t want to get into the ‘clothes off’ situation…’ (Eric, self-identified hetero-asexual man)  Further, in reflecting on the process of ‘becoming’ hetero-asexual, Eric argued that his sexuality had wavered as a consequence of his lack of sex-drive. Before identifying as ‘hetero-asexual’, Eric identified as ‘bisexual’: ‘until my interest in sex waned, erm, I would have said bisexual but majority hetero’. It was the relationship with men he was interested in, not the practice of engaging in ‘sex’. Similarly, Ida, a self-identified lesbian woman reflected on the fluidity of her sexuality by drawing on language of dis-identification with ‘bisexuality’:   A  I have been attracted to men erm but overall I think that I am, you know, I don’t know what per cent, but you know… erm I don’t like, well I’m happy at the moment but like if I was single, I wouldn’t rule out that I could fall in love with a man… I think it is possible… so… erm…  Q  so like somewhere on the spectrum maybe like? A   yeah…. I mean, yeah, I mean yeah… again like, I feel like it is helpful to, to be sort of, to say that you’re erm… gay or lesbian  Q mm A   erm… because again it is sort of a, it is also sort of a political and you know I sometimes feel that the spectrum can be misused by, again a male agenda, which is like ‘wow, lesbians who haven’t met the right man yet’ these kinds of things so in some sense I do feel like, you know, again a solidarity with women who love women or whatever Q yeah A um… that it should be, you know, that people should be able to feel that lifestyle choice (Ida, self-identified lesbian woman)  Even though Ida, who is in a relationship with a woman, argued that ‘I wouldn’t rule out that I could fall in love with a man’, she did not identify as ‘bisexual’ or constructed ‘bisexuality’ as a possible identification, which means ‘bisexuality’ is silenced and constructed as the ‘unsayable’. 159  By arguing ‘it is helpful to say you’re gay or lesbian’, Ida draws upon the binary discourse associated with heteronormativity whereby non-binary sexualities, including bisexuality, are constructed as unintelligible subject positions whereby binaries are reinforced and further (re)produces intelligibility. As such, by avoiding the bisexual ‘label’, bisexuality is reproduced as silenced and makes it difficult for other academics to find representation and come out from the ‘bisexual closet’ as discussed in Section 7.2.2.   Additionally, through saying ‘people should be able to feel that lifestyle choice’, identifying as ‘gay’ or ‘lesbian’ as a choice is perceived a possibility, whereby identifying as ‘bisexual’ as a choice is not, as discussed by Grace in Section 7.2.2. As such, Ida constructed her sexuality as either ‘lesbian’ or “straight” depending on who she is in a relationship with as ‘spectrum’ identifications, such as bisexuality, is sexualised to facilitate a ‘male’ agenda that (re)enforce the sexual objectification of bisexuality, which Alice referred to in Section 7.2.3. Additionally, drawing on the academic discourse of traditional research, Adam referred to his personal experiences and argued that research conducted on “straight” men engaging in sexual activity with other men, tend to find men dis-identify from ‘gay’ or ‘bisexual’ identities due to societal homophobia and biphobia.  For example, Adam argued that men having sex with men actively dis-identify with ‘bisexuality’ as ‘straightness’ remains a privileged and ‘natural’ identification rendering ‘bisexuality’ as a choice unsayable. Rather than deconstructing the power associated with heteronormativity and ‘stable’ heterosexual identities, dis-identification with bisexuality might facilitate biphobic views that bisexuality does not exist. Additionally, Caroline, a self-identified lesbian woman also constructed an intelligible sexuality as fitting ‘in’ on either side of the binary:   ‘…It’s interesting as well, because from the minute I started dating women I never identified as bisexual. It, it was completely like ‘that was it now’.’ (Caroline, self-identified lesbian woman)  Drawing upon binary discourse, Caroline constructed ‘lesbian’ as a stable ‘end point’ identity as opposed to bisexuality. While Caroline positioned herself as gay and had been in relationships with men before identifying as gay, she constructed her sexuality in relation to what she was not, which was “straight” or ‘bisexual’. Compared to Ida, Caroline recognizes ‘bisexuality’ as a subject position available for her to occupy. However, ‘bisexual’ was in this manner constructed as a 160  transitory subject position available before ‘becoming’ lesbian. Later in the interview, Caroline reflected on the norms around sexuality where she stressed that she was being ‘assumed to be straight’ when she was dating a girl named ‘Ashley’. However, as she did not want people ‘to think I’m bi’, she chose not to correct people assuming ‘Ashley’ to be a ‘man’. Rather than challenging heteronormative ideals associated with the normalcy of heterosexuality and the hetero/homosexual binary, Caroline decided to let people assume she was straight, particularly as she did not want to be associated with ‘bisexuality’. When ‘bisexuality’ is constructed as ‘unsayable’ or ‘transitory’, people often come to believe that they are restricted to identify as either straight or gay which was found to present particular difficulties for self-identified ‘bisexual’ academics, an assumption that is further (re)produced in society and workplaces. As such, identifying as ‘bisexual’ as a choice, irrespective of the relationship they were in, was found in the narratives above to be questionable, it also (re)produces binary thinking by removing the experiences of people identifying with non-binary genders.   7.3.2 Bi/pan: avoiding transphobia  When self-identifying ‘as bisexual’, Alice, Drew, Alex and Abby argued LGBT community and academic research attempted to (re)enforce binaries by constructing ‘bisexuality’ as a term that solely describes attraction towards women and/or men, hence constructing bisexuality as transphobic. The issues around normative language to discuss and identify bisexuality and the stigma and biphobia was internalised in Alice’s narrative when asked if there were any expectations associated with identifying as ‘bisexual’:  ‘Yeah all the time, stuff all the time about like who I am dating or how I am dating or and… the monogamousness of relationships and things like that. erm… about whether I miss boys or girls or things like that and or about whether my identity is transphobic, which is just not true, particularly if I like, most of us actually identify as transgender as well as bisexual, it is so completely erm… I think injustice to them, those trans bi people to kind of say that, for me to agree that that is transphobic.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  Alice argued that bisexuality was constructed as a transphobic identification, a misinterpretation of the label as she stressed that most bisexual people ‘actually identify as transgender as well as bisexual’, which was the case of Charlotte, a self-identified bisexual trans woman. When bisexuality is constructed as transphobic, there is an underlying perception that bisexuality only 161  includes cisgender women and men and attraction towards cis women and men. As such, Alice further argued that bisexuality does not exclude trans people as she argued ‘bisexuality fits in very close with the transgender community’ as both ‘trans’ and ‘bisexual’ are identifications that reject gender binaries. As such, bisexuality was stereotypically constructed as equalling two genders tied with hetero- and cisnormativity. In this manner, Alice, Kaitlin, Ash, Abby, Doris, Charlotte, Anna and Drew argued that heteronormative categories are restrictive and whereas one category might be useful for identification purposes in one context, they drew upon other categories to occupy in other settings most notably ‘queer’ or ‘pansexual’, in addition to bisexuality.   Abby argued that the reason for occupying several categories was because ‘a lot of that has to do with how they’re perceived by other people’ including academic colleagues as discussed in Section 7.2. The issue of ‘bisexuality’ being constructed by ‘other people’, or the people positioned in the ‘sayable’ heteronormative categories, not to include trans and non-binary people was a topic that guided discussions around participants’ construction of ‘bisexuality’. Abby therefore argued her sexuality had been ‘a little bit of a discovery process’ whereby she did not identify strongly with any categories because of how these categories are perceived by the others:  ‘so, so as they say, my behaviour is very much what you would consider bi or pan in kind of normal terms, but it is not, it’s an issue, it’s some labels I have a few issues with and I feel like the issues that get resolved by one are issues with another, so people saying that… bisexual as a label doesn’t encompass trans people whereas pan does, but also… there’s, there’s this kind of thing amongst pansexual people of being so self-righteous about the whole thing and I don’t really want to be associated with that...like, I just want to… fall in love with who I fall in love with [smiles].’ (Abby, self-identified bisexual woman)  Here Abby argues that identifying as ‘bi’ or ‘pan’ as ‘normal terms’ does not hold any relevance in terms of the gender she might be attracted to but rather wants to ‘fall in love with who I fall in love with’. She thus distanced herself from both bisexuality and pansexual as the labels were constructed in ways she did not want to be associated with. Nevertheless, she did refer to these normative categories when asked how she identified although being wary of how these categories are restricted and normalised. Further, Abby’s narrative around categorical discourses shows that she perceived herself forced to draw upon one or more categories to satisfy the societal pressure to be located within categories, when she actually does not feel she belongs in either category. 162  Similarly, Alex further explained why she felt the need to draw on both bisexuality and pansexual in order to position herself in the academy as a bi/pan academic:    ‘... This is why I feel like I have to say ‘bi slash pan’, because people are kind of like, ‘Oh, if you’re bi you’re transphobic or, you know, you don’t accept intersex or genderqueer people because ‘bi’ means two, so clearly you only acknowledge male and female or man and woman’. So it’s kind of like, ‘well, it’s more than two. The term has evolved’. But, yeah, like a lot of the time I feel like I have to specify both.’ (Alex, self-identified bi/pan woman)  Thus, rather than troubling academic heteronormativity permeating stable gender and sexualities, occupying a ‘bisexual’ subject position means being stereotyped as transphobic, non-inclusive towards intersex and genderqueer people and (re)producing cisgenders. Although Grace constructed ‘bisexual’ as attraction towards man/woman hence drawing on the discourse of cisnormativity in Section 7.2.1, Alex constructed bisexuality to include attraction towards more than two genders, as the ‘term has evolved’.  However, to avoid being labelled transphobic, Alex argues she needs to specify identifying as ‘bi/pan’ to others. In order to distance themselves from cis- and heteronormativity Abby, Alex, Drew and Ash drew on several categories to account for societal biphobia and transphobia which works to (re)produce biphobia rather than challenging it. Despite bisexuality being constructed as transphobic, Charlotte self-identified as a ‘bisexual trans woman’ rather than ‘pansexual’ and argued ‘I guess, theoretically, people would generally classify me as ‘pan’, but I am not entirely fond of that description’.   As seen in Dorothy’s narrative in Section 7.2.1, the LGBT community was constructed as trans- and bi excluding where trans and bi people are perceived as not ‘legitimate’ genders and sexualities as they challenge cis, hetero and homonormativity. Although Charlotte recognised that ‘pansexual’ and ‘lesbian’ are subject positions available for her to occupy, identifying as both trans and bisexual she challenges the biphobic and transphobic ideas that trans women cannot be bisexual and that bisexual equals attraction towards two genders (Alex). In this manner, whereas bisexuality was constructed by ‘talkable’ subjects, meaning people occupying straight and gay identities, to reproduce the binary, pansexuality was constructed as a more inclusive and all-encompassing term. As such, Drew internalised these socially conditioned discourses around ‘bisexuality’ and ‘pansexuality’:  163  ‘So, for me, a sort of bisexual, it’s an acknowledgement that I’ve took to a place where I understand that I have been attracted and am still attracted to people of different genders and that means men, it means women, it means people who are identifying as non-binary, as trans. I’ve had attractions to lots of different people. So, that’s why and part of the reason I’ve used bisexual instead of pansexual, as an example, is that I haven’t… Two reasons really. One is because bisexual is more recognised, more people have heard of it and the other is because I haven’t yet been attracted to every gender so, erm, I can’t necessarily say that that wouldn’t change over time and that I might, at some point in the future, want to call myself pan-sexual instead of bisexual but somehow bisexual makes more sense to me.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman)  Drew identifies as bisexual as she has and still is attracted to people of different genders, however, she also internalises bisexuality to not include attraction towards ‘all genders’ and as such might identify as ‘pansexual’ in the future. The (re)production of binarism and cisnormativity is also damaging for trans people who also identifies as ‘bisexual’, as the ‘norm’ has the power to re-create knowledge around who can identify as bisexual and who cannot, as seen in Alex, Alice and Abby’s narratives above. However, when bisexuality is silenced and rendered ‘unspeakable’, misunderstandings and stereotypes get (re)produced as the ‘truth’ rather than being challenged and openly discussed in the academy. As such, it can be argued that non-binary sexualities represented an excluded sexuality because of its fluidity and misunderstandings that are socially reproduced as ‘normal’:  ‘because people don’t just assume what your behaviour is going to be, people assume your personality and things from it as well and I do get that with… straight and gay just as much, but you don’t get it… quite, it’s not, I wouldn’t think it’s quite as negative nowadays whereas certainly pan has this kind of label of being overly pretentious and super hipster and things like that and I don’t like saying that I’ve met a lot of people who fall into that stereotype but I have, and I don’t want to be associated with that. … and I’ve also met plenty of people who don’t fall into that stereotype and that’s fine as well and if they choose that label for themselves then I can’t, I’m not going to say no, because that’s how they want to define themselves, but equally I don’t feel comfortable considering myself in that way either.’ (Abby, self-identified bisexual, pan woman)  164  Comparing ‘pansexuality’ to ‘gay’ and “straight”, Abby argues that assumptions underpinning these subject positions are less negative than ‘pan’ and although she does not want to ‘pin point’ anyone to underlying assumptions, she equally does not feel comfortable identifying as such. However, although ‘pansexual’ is perceived to deconstruct the stereotype of bisexuality to include attraction towards two genders, Doris, Drew and Ash drew upon ‘queer’ in order to challenge cis- and heteronormativity associated with both ‘bisexual’ and ‘pansexual’, which is discussed in the next section.   7.3.3 Queer: (de)constructing cis- and heteronormativity  Further, ‘queer’ was constructed as an available subject position in order to deconstructs the binary stereotype associated with bisexuality. For example, Doris found it difficult finding a ‘place’ on either side of the spectrum thus usually self-identified as ‘queer’ in equality forms in the academy. When filling out equality measures at work, Doris stressed she was always uncertain of whether to tick off the ‘bisexual’ or ‘lesbian’ box, particularly, as ‘queer’ is constructed as the unsayable on such measures by not being an available subject position to ‘tick off’. The decision to draw on ‘queer’ to position herself was influenced by cis- and heteronormativity’s forces to construct stable gender and sexualities:   ‘Being queer I suppose is, I mean, on the one hand it is about being in a female or female relationship, but it is also about a lot more. It is about a political identification I suppose, critiquing a heteronormative patriarchal structure of society, critiquing ehm… cis-normativity, so recognizing that my straightforward identification with my gender, assigned gender, is something that is socially conditioned, it is not really to do with biology ehm… yeah… so critiquing those structures and also, hopefully, erm… having an openness to different sexual or gender formations…’ (Doris, self-identified queer bisexual woman)  Doris constructs ‘queer’ as a political identification that seeks to deconstruct cis- and heteronormativity by recognizing that her gender is not a stable identity conditioned by biology but rather an on-going and performative accomplishment both in the private realm and in the academy. In Doris’ narrative, ‘queer’ is constructed as a discourse seeking to move away from heterogendered underpinnings of sexuality, which was seen in Section 6.3 to be pervading in the academy. Participants referred to several categories to deconstruct cisnormativity and heteronormativity at work, which ‘bisexuality’ is constructed and perceived as unable to do as a 165  stand-alone-category, whereas ‘pan’ and ‘queer’ does. Drawing on wider discourses such as traditional femininity, academic culture and family, Doris elaborated on how her sexuality called the stability of her gender identity into question after her daughter was born, and particularly after coming back to work after her two week ‘paternity leave’ as her partner gave birth to their daughter.   ‘… that was when I started having bit of a gender identity crisis in that I have always identified as being a woman, but certainly I did not feel like I was being treated the way that I thought women would be treated I… was being treated like a man was treated.  Even down to the fact that I had taken what was legally termed paternity leave… because maternity leave only belongs to birth women… birth women? Birthmothers? I don’t even know… erm… and there’s this whole… there’s no… there’s not even any language to describe women who are the co-parents of their children erm often called non-birth mothers, which is quite negating…  because whenever… you know… because, during that period… if it came up (at work)… you know, I might be saying “my daughter this”, people might say ‘how old is your daughter?’ and I would say “oh she’s three weeks old”, and they would just stare at me… and then I would have to say something negating like “oh I didn’t give birth to her” or “I am not the birthmother”, so I would say something that negated my identity rather than a positive thing… yeah it was difficult and I found some questioning my gender a lot and I’ve found it hard to know how to discuss it at work.’ (Doris, self-identified queer bisexual woman)   In this respect, Doris drew upon heteronormativity to illustrate that she could not be ‘read’ by fellow academics to ‘do’ gender as identifying as ‘the mother’ but not ‘birthmother’ was causing gender trouble in the academy (Butler, 1999). As such, it was perceived that reproduction makes the ‘female’ body visible by complying with normative and heterosexual forms of femininities where the potential to get pregnant are elements that construct a woman as ‘woman’. By saying ‘I have a daughter’, academic colleagues assumed that Doris was the birthmother hence complying with the normative understanding that ‘mother’ equals ‘woman’ hence ‘heterosexual’. However, being in ‘a lesbian relationship’, identifying as ‘queer’ and feminine, while being forced to take ‘paternity leave’ socially constructed as men’s entitlement, Doris could not be read as a ‘real’ woman nor ‘a real mother’ in the academy. This demonstrates the heterosexual matrix (Butler, 1999) in action in the academy whereby Doris internalised the subversion of the ‘norm’ and started to have a ‘gender identity crisis’. Rather than complying with academic heteronormative 166  femininity, Doris is reconstructing gender and constructing a place ‘in-between’ femininity/masculinity to enact gender. Further, Doris’ narrative shows how heteronormative practices have the power to restrict language to talk about non-normative lives. However, internalising the institutional (hetero)norms reproduced in the academic workplace meant that Doris had questioned whether her daughter needed two mothers.  Doris’ narrative reflects the constraints of heteronormativity in creating normative family relations and gendered roles, and how heterosexuality and gender are interchangeably linked to the point where their power forces non-straight people to question their belonging and right to identify as ‘cisgender’. Additionally, Doris’ negotiation of traditional femininities, heteronormativity and family discourse in the context of the academic workplace, demonstrate the power held by the institution to create normative genders and parental roles. In other words, paternity leave is an institutional policy and therefore a discourse within academia constructing normative relations in the way that men are entitled to paternity leave and women are entitled to maternity leave. In this case, academia can be argued to hold the knowledge thus the power to avoid queering, hence dismantling institutional heteronormativity and its underlying privileges. Further, the inclusiveness of ‘queer’ and the potential to deconstruct normative underpinnings of gender and sexuality were also referred to by Drew as a rationale behind positioning herself as ‘queer’ in addition to ‘bisexual’ and ‘grey ace’. As such, coining Doris’ narrative, Drew also referred to ‘queer’ as an identity she draws on to question her gender ‘assigned’ at birth hence deconstructing gender as biologically determined or ‘given’:    ‘As for queer, I tend to use it more politically and to be more inclusive but also because I’m continually questioning my own identity. I don’t, I have, I use bisexual now, I use grey ace but I can’t say that, you know, in some point in the future that that won’t change and I’m always questioning. In terms of being a cis woman, I have sort of questioned whether that is absolutely my gender identity. I can’t say that won’t change in the future.’ (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman)  Grey-ace is a category available for people who could self-identify as asexuality but do not fit into the mainstream description of asexuality. Drawing on grey-ace in addition to ‘queer’, Drew depicted ‘queer’ as an identity allowing her to question her gender identity as stable but also to signify the fluidity of her sexuality. As such, both Drew and Doris argued that queer moves away 167  from normative understandings of gender and sexuality as binary and stable categories. It could be argued that age influences Doris’ (41 years old) and Drew’s (42 years old) construction of ‘queer’, as Doris reflected back to being in university when ‘queer’ was an unspoken identity in a society where cisnormativity was taken for granted. Doris thus argued “it was okay to be queer… but you couldn’t use the word queer, you use the word gay and you know… you… it was alright to go to a gay club, but it wasn’t alright in other contexts”. Taking up a ‘queer’ identity, was perceived by Doris to be a recent discourse that used to be hidden and unspoken, however, drawing on ‘queer’ allows her to challenge the normative and traditional gendered expectations. Similarly, Drew referred to herself as queer to challenge cis- and heteronormativity. Drawing on wider discourses of biology, sexism and cisnormativity, Drew argued that her breasts constructed her as ‘a woman’ and the sexism associated with being ‘read’ as woman made her question her gender identity, which was a practice possible by positioning herself as ‘queer’ as seen above:   Q Yeah, and like in what way have you been questioning being a cis woman for example? A Okay, so I’d have, since I, since puberty really, I sort of didn’t really, erm, not at ease with certain parts of my physical body so, erm, and they tend to be around things like… There was something, something about going through puberty and sort of, you know, growing breasts, how that felt and the ways in which I was treated differently suddenly and I stopped being that kind of seen as a child or started being seen as a girl or a woman, erm, and there were things around that that I didn’t think that those reactions to me and things like that that were negative experiences. So, as a result, I kind of, I don’t have, I have some issues with breasts in particular, not, not with other people’s breasts by the way, and, yeah, so it’s kind of, I have questioned whether or not that feeling of negativity towards my own, towards that thing that makes me a woman or the things that physically make me a woman. Q Yeah, yeah. A The problems that I have with that, actually means that I, yeah, but I, it’s, I’m at a very early stage in trying to be thinking about that. I don’t really have answers to any of my questions so I use cis woman because it feels the most representative of me at the moment. (Drew, self-identified bisexual, grey ace, queer woman)  Drawing on discourses such as sexism, femininity, and biology, Drew deconstructs the stability of the normativity of ‘sex/gender/sexuality’ relations by arguing that puberty, and growing breasts in 168  particular, made the female body visible in ways she was uncomfortable with. In this construct of ‘woman’, breasts are a gendered construct of the ‘female’ body that becomes naturalised through ‘sexism’. Sexism was also discussed in Section 6.5.2, which has a negative impact on self-identified bisexual positioning as women in the academy and society. However, Drew is deconstructing the normative idea of a stable and fixed biological ‘female’ body by thinking of removing her breasts. Within this deconstruction of the ‘female’ body, Drew further constructed non-binary genders as an available subject position for her to occupy. However, she did not refer to herself as such as ‘they don’t necessarily tell the same stories as I do, they don’t necessarily use the same terms and words as I would’. This illustrates how subject positions are fluid and that identifications have different meanings to different people, rather than being stable and generalizable categories. However, Drew’s narrative above recognizes ‘queer’ as an available subject position ‘because I’m continually questioning my own identity’ and non-binary identifications as having the possibility to deconstruct the naturalisation of the sexed/gendered body.   Furthermore, Ash also referred to themselves as queer, however, ‘if people want me to be more specific then in terms of sexuality my… erm the decreasing order of preferences queer, pansexual, bisexual’. Although bisexuality is the least preferable sexuality to occupy, Ash constructs bisexuality as an available subject position despite being stereotyped as (re)producing binaries and inclusivity towards cis women and men as seen in Alice, Alex and Abby’s narratives on bisexuality/pansexuality in Section 7.3.2. When discussing their gender identity, they argued their gender was fluid and open to change:   ‘Um… if discussing gender then again Queer, genderqueer, then non-binary, I’ve not really what… I’ve not yet managed to find a good sort of sense of what erm… [sights]… I haven’t found the categorisation or a label that quite feels right yet but queer or queer is good enough and I normally short answer is genderqueer erm I… when being asked about my gender history I do actively also identify as trans.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  Similar to Drew’s understanding of the difficulties positioning herself into ‘normative’ categories, Ash had not found the categorisation or label that ‘feels right’. However, by identifying as queer, Ash deconstructs normative understandings of man/woman as natural identifications based on 169  biology. However, despite identifying as queer and genderqueer in the academic context, Ash argued they felt they might be taken less seriously giving talks in the academy ‘because I don’t wear makeup, because I don’t perform femininity’. Even though Ash’s identification challenges the hetero/homo, feminine/masculine, woman/man binaries, they drew upon discourses within the academic workplace to explain how the academy attempts to (re)produce heteronormative practices around traditional heterosexual femininities to be performed by women for example through wearing makeup. Although Ash had clearly stated they prefer being referred to as they/them in the STEMM department, they drew upon academic cis- and heteronormative discourses to explain how normativity is (re)produced in their department by attempting to force normative and heterosexual forms of genders upon Ash in order to read them as intelligible:   ‘I, I, I think my sexuality… is accepted, I think as far as I need to have a fight it would be about people assuming that I am straight because they are assuming that I am a cis woman rather than anything that isn’t strongly influenced by… what they think of my gender.’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  This narrative demonstrates how Ash perceived gender and sexuality to be inextricably linked in the academy, where to be read and pass as a ‘woman’ means being ‘cisgender’ and perform heterosexual femininities. Because Ash challenges this heterosexual norm, it could be argued that the denaturalisation of heterosexual femininity performed by Ash excluded them from a sense of belonging in the academic workplace where they perceived academia to only want ‘bits and pieces’ of them to exist:   ‘[The] awareness of the academy is not set up for lives like mine to exist in it and I know that I am like, I am white and middle class and from an academic family erm and that is massive advantages but… I am also perceived as female and visibly disabled and visibly Queer in ways that do again feel slightly alienating from community and slightly as though… the combination of all those risks making people take me less seriously or think that I am less competent because I know studies on sending out CV’s with a male coded name versus a female coded name and what happens from there…’ (Ash, self-identified queer, pansexual, bisexual genderqueer)  170  Ash’s narrative demonstrate how heteronormativity creates and constructs subjects deemed ‘intelligible’, to the extent that people whose gender identity does not follow from (hetero)sexuality cannot be read in the academy, hence subjected to exclusion and marginalisation for breaking the ‘gender norm’. Ash’s narrative also shows how the intersection of (dis)ability, gender and sexuality make their experience in finding community and belonging in the academy difficult as it serves to value and privilege straight, able bodied, white, ‘male’ academics. The analysis presented in this section sought to illustrate the ways in which taking up ‘queer’ identities has the ability to deconstruct the stability of academic cis- and heteronormativity. However, as seen in Ash’s narrative, they felt the academy was not ‘set up for lives like mine to exist’, which reinforce the discourse of sexuality as a private matter as academia is not ready to become an ‘academy of queers’.  7.3.4 Avoiding ‘queer’ While a number of participants embraced ‘queer’, others were less comfortable with that identity label. Alice, James and Abby distanced themselves from ‘queer’ where James constructed and perceived ‘queerness’ as a ‘radical’ identification, which ‘gay’ is not:   ‘…Um, so it doesn’t feel like I need to kind of draw on that sort of radical, erm, you know, the kind of radical image of queerness… so I would describe myself as a feminist but, erm, I don’t think I’d describe myself as queer, because I...  that brings kind of stuff that I just don’t desperately need to draw on, I suppose.’ (James, self-identified gay man)  James constructs ‘queer’ in relation to a theoretically informed academic ‘self’ in order to distance himself from ‘queerness’. As seen in Doris and Drew’s narratives in the preceding section, it could be argued that dismantling gender as ‘stable’ is the ‘radicalness’ that James is referring to. When constructed as ‘radical’, queer can be viewed as a fluid identification that questions academic practices rendering gender as ‘stable’ and ‘biologically informed/determined’. Although Alice strongly identifies as bisexual, ‘queer’ was constructed as a subject position she could draw upon to avoid the stigma associated with bisexuality in the academy:   ‘… I think it is very important for me to identify with bisexual rather than pansexual or queer. Occasionally I use queer, usually I just say… just trying to avoid all of the stigma that comes out that is associated with bisexual, because you can get around that by using queer and gay, 171  but I try to challenge myself to be as open as possible. Because I think I am in a quite privileged position that I can be, but I still find myself tidying it, I do all I can.’  (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  Alice thus argues by occupying a queer identity, bisexual people can avoid the stigma and biphobia associated with the label, as ‘queer’ can be drawn upon to facilitate a sense of belonging to the LGBTQIA community without being perceived as ‘not queer enough’. However, within the academic workplace, Alice argued that it was important for her to actively ‘bring my sexuality’ in teaching, because occupying a gay and queer position does not challenge biphobia. Additionally, Anna, a self-identified bisexual woman dis-identified with ‘queer’ and argued that the label contributed to erasing the political struggles associated with ‘bisexuality’ as it ‘sort of covers up the differences between different sexualities’. Similar to Alice, Anna constructed queer as a label to occupy in order to avoid biphobia. Paradoxically, using ‘queer’ perpetuates bi-erasure and masks gendered differences between non-binary sexualities. In particular, Anna stated ‘okay we don’t need to talk about specific issues faced by lesbian or ‘bisexuals’’, because we’re all queer now’, which stresses how gendered differences and experiences among lesbian and bisexual women are being erased by taking up a ‘queer’ subject position. By removing gendered differences from sexuality studies, Alice drew upon her workplace experience to explain that queer research in the academy is still marginalised within gender studies:  ‘I think it is interesting, I feel like sexuality studies are kind of in this kind of tiny box within gender studies and there isn’t much recognition of queerness in a wider sense or like in a wider sense, it is still quite marginalized, it’s kind of like “oh I’m gonna go and study with the other queer people”.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  As such, it could be argued that the analytical separation between gender and sexuality renders ‘queer’ research perceived to facilitate a ‘male’ focus (Doris and Ida) whereby gendered differences and experiences are silenced under the ‘queer’ rubric. Echoing Anna, Alice argued that identifying as ‘queer’ not only masks gendered differences, but might stop bisexual communities from forming:   ‘Um… I think in some ways yes, I think there is this kind of move, like more and more people are identifying as, particularly women, are identifying as fluid or queer, or pan, and I think 172  that is very good, but I think there is also this pressure to move away from labels, I think that while that is kind of important and those categories are socially constructed and that is very problematic, in some ways, it can stop bisexual communities from organizing when actually I think finding that community is really important to me and important means of being supported and… that is important for all people who are non-monosexual bisexual people. So I find the label to make it easier for people to find the community to find support systems and I think it is interesting that bisexuality is sometimes transgender there is this kind of “lets move away from labels”, you don’t really say that to lesbian women or gay men… erm I think it is apolitical this kind of idea that we should erase bisexuality completely… because that is what it feels like when people are like “why do we need to identify as anything, we are all just humans”, it’s kind of erasing my struggle and my political struggle as well.’ (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman)  Alice draws on discourses around biphobia, labels and community/belonging to demonstrate the difficulties of ‘moving away from labels’ and in particular, the difficulties for self-identified ‘bisexuals’. The discursive delineation of ‘queer’ as another bi-erasing label further perpetuates marginalisation of ‘bisexuals’ where ‘non-label’ is an alternative subject position sought to erase bisexuality (Anna) that ‘you don’t really say to lesbian women or gay men’ (Alice). This again serves to construct bisexuality as a ‘non-sexuality’, which marginalises and erases identities that are not lesbian, straight or gay. This construction of ‘bisexuality’ was perceived to compliment hetero- and homonormativity that pushes ‘bisexuality’ under the ‘queer’ umbrella to (re)position the ‘bisexual’ identity as illegitimate, indecisive and (in)visible (Alice, Drew, Dorothy).   7.4 Conclusions The first findings chapter sought to discuss the three first objectives set out in Section 1.3 to discuss how academics construct sexuality and gender and its impact on navigating academia ‘with a sexuality’, as straight academics are seen as not having a sexuality. Chapter Six further discussed the contextual factors restricting LGBTQIA academics from bringing sexuality to work. The current chapter, however, addresses objective four focusing on non-binary sexualities, in particular bisexuality as 11 of the 30 participants self-identified as such. The findings illustrate that participants constructed bisexuality in two predominant ways in the academy, firstly as (in)visible which included navigating academia as perceived, or assumed “straight” by default. The discursive construction of ‘bisexuality’ as (in)visible in the academy directly relates to wider discourses such 173  as binarism, heteronormativity, community and traditional views on masculinity and femininity and academic culture. This often meant that in passing as academic, bisexuality was constructed as a private identity (George, Anna, Drew, Abby, Alex) where bisexual academics were often not perceived to be ‘queer enough to do queer research’ (Alice). As such, subject positions available when bisexuality is constructed as (in)visible includes ‘assumed straight’, ‘lesbian/gay’, cis man or woman whereby two genders and two sexualities exists.   On the other hand, bisexuality was also constructed as ‘radical’ whereby participants argued bisexuality was often perceived as transphobic, not complying with heteronormative rules of gender essentialism and unconventional sexual relationship(s). When constructed as ‘radical’, bisexuality opens up for a wider range of possibilities in relation to available subject positions including queer, pansexual, non-binary identifications and non-monosexual relationships. This construction of sexuality can further ‘queer’ the normativity of ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ and its inherently ‘normative’ gender expectations, roles and knowledge. This chapter sought to examine how non-binary sexualities, and bisexuality in particular, enact gender to make it seem ‘natural’ within the discourse of academic culture but also how these subjectivities can become undone through non-compliance with the rigid and strict institutional norms. This chapter demonstrates the institutional power of academia in constructing and (re)constructing normative views and knowledge of gender and sexuality in order to avoid dismantling the heterosexual privilege heteronormativity works hard to maintain. The next chapter will more widely discuss the findings discussed in chapters Six and Seven, which are related back to the literature presented in chapters Two to Four.          174  Chapter 8 Discussion of findings  8.1 Introduction Chapters Six and Seven presented the findings from this qualitative research focusing on how sexuality and gender are negotiated in the UK academy. Chapter Six discussed the discourses emerging from the first part of Willig’s (2008; 2013) Foucauldian Discourse Analysis (FDA) with academics identifying across the gender and sexual spectrum with particular interest in how academics negotiate heteronormativity at work. Additionally, Chapter Seven presented the findings furthering Willig’s (2008; 2013) FDA whereby the analysis focused on how participants constructed the discursive object ‘non-binary sexualities’ with a particular focus on ‘bisexuality’ aiming to account for the criticism of queer theory to reproduce, rather than challenging, the hetero/homo binary. This chapter seeks to further discuss the findings in relation to the extant literature and theoretical framework presented in Chapters Two to Four to identify where the current research adds to the existing empirical research on the research matter. The table of the respondent profiles were presented in Table 5.4 in Chapter Five. As such, this chapter is be structured to answer the four research objectives first set out in Section 1.3.   8.2 Discursive arrangements constraining sexual and gendered academic identities This section, in combination with Section 8.3, seeks to answer objective one and two namely to understand the role of sexuality in academics’ working lives which was found to be directly linked to how academics negotiate heteronormativity in creating and sustaining sexualities deemed ‘normal’ in the academy. As such, this section starts with a disruption of the ‘normativity’ of heterosexuality as a subject position. As identified in Section 7.3, heterosexuality in the academy was often taken for granted as ‘natural’ hence reproduced as ‘invisible’ and unmarked norm, which is supported by the extant literature arguing sexuality research tends to neglect ‘heterosexuality’ from sexuality research (Fotaki, 2013; Green, 2002; Namaste, 1994; Spargo, 2000; Danby, 2007; Rumens et al, 2019).   Although ‘heterosexuality’ is constructed as the ‘original’ and ‘real’ sexuality that people should mirror, straightness is also a ‘doing’ and ‘undoing’ of norms that works to create a perception of a ‘true’ gender (Butler, 1999), which should not be taken for granted within the academy. However, in academic institutions, heterosexual masculinity is signified as the desirable performance of gender as it is constructed as ‘normal’ thus normative (Rumens, 2016a). For example, Schroedinger, a participant, in stating and referring to himself as ‘a fairly normal man…that is not 175  explicitly sexist’, is performatively doing gender by taking on an implicit sexist attitude, researching traditional, masculine topics, identifying as “straight” and cis-male hence read as culturally intelligible in the academic context (Butler, 1999). He also drew on biology in order to position himself as a ‘man’. As such, Schroedinger constructs an essentialist ontology implying gender to derive from ‘sex’, whereby men are constructed as having biologically ‘male’ bodies whereby identifying as “straight” allows him to draw on a discourse of normalcy within the academic context (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014).   Rather than there being a ‘core’ (biology) that produces gender, drawing on queer theory, it is evident that Schroedinger’s identification as a ‘normal man’ is performatively constituted by the expressions he ‘does’, which allows him to refer to himself as such (Butler, 1999). Thus from a queer theoretical perspective, Schroedingers narrative makes visible the citations involved in maintaining and reproducing the claim of ‘normalcy’ where the male-masculine-straight nexus, or the heterosexual matrix (Butler, 1999) continue to (re)produce intelligible genders and academic bodies. As such, referring to ‘normality’ implies ‘straightness’, which was reflected in the participants’ discussions in Section 6.2, where for example Isabel argued that she identified as ‘failed heterosexual…followed by lesbian’. This claim of a ‘failed heterosexual’ identity makes visible the heterosexual framework that seeks to construct straight desire as ‘true’ and homosexual desire as ‘a mask and forever false’ (Butler, 1993:121). However, there are implications of constructing straight desire as ‘true’ or ‘right’, as the current study found non-straight academics perceived only “straight” performing academics to be validated as ‘professional’. For example, as discussed in Section 6.3.1, participants constructed their academic identities in relation to the normality of heterosexuality whereby passing as straight meant being legitimized as proper objects of academic life.   Thus, drawing on a Foucauldian discourse analysis to challenge academic normativity, the research found that normative heterosexual masculinity silences and constrains the becoming of queerer academic subjectivities. This illustrates the power relations of silence where the ‘speakable’ (heterosexuality) is differentiated from the ‘unspeakable’ (homosexuality) (Butler, 1997). As sexuality is constructed as a private concern (Bowring and Brewis, 2009), sexuality was perceived by participants in this study to not have a place in the academic context where difference from the heteronormative ideal does not go unrecognized. This research stresses that ‘the think academic, think straight ‘male’ logic’ is being idealised in the academy in order to ensure that certain forms 176  of heterosexuality remain secured (Butler, 1999). For example, the current research found that in order to gain acceptance, non-straight ‘male’ academics had to position themselves as both masculine and straight speaking subjects to minimise difference from the straight male academic ‘ideal’. This finding echoes the research presented by Fotaki and Harding (2012) on women entering academia. It is clear from the discussion above that, as “straightness” is invisible in the academic context, queerness is downplayed in order to construct an academic thus professional ‘self’ (Rumens and Kerfoot 2009). The next section will expand on the discussion above in answering objective one and two, namely how academics negotiate heteronormativity in constructing sexualities deemed ‘normal’.   8.3 Negotiating the public/private divide in constructing an academic ‘self’ In order to understand the role sexuality plays in academics’ working lives, it is evident from the discussion above that heterosexuality is normalised to the extent that any disruption to this perceived ‘stable’ and ‘privileged’ identity will not go unrecognized as ‘normal’. Butler (1993) thus stresses the importance of locating how heteronormativity reappears within non-heterosexual identities, which will be discussed in relation to constructing a ‘normal’ academic sense of self, in order to address objective two. As such the findings illustrate that to ‘become normal’ means adhering to norms founded by heteronormative discourses surrounding (heterogendered) embodiment and (heteronormative) family/relationships that both work to disqualify femininity as associated with academic subjectivity.   8.3.1 Queering the private As indicated in sections 6.3.1 and 6.5 in Chapter Six, there is evidence to suggest that the compulsoriness of heterosexuality is ingrained in the organisational culture of the academy (Rumens, 2016a) whereby academics are metaphorically “travellers” in a heterosexual world (Gheradi, 1996:191). Discussions around sexuality, or more specifically ‘non-normative’ sexualities, were constructed as private matters despite the claim that universities are becoming increasingly ‘gay friendly’ (Grove, 2016b). For example, Alice, a self-identified bisexual woman, argued that queerness was a private matter whereby academics “are expected to leave your person…. personal things at home”, rendering queerness unspeakable (Foucault, 1979). Thus adhering to “professionalism” implies leaving sexuality at home and conforming to heterosexual norms. These private/public or queer/straight dichotomies were further argued by George, a self-identified bisexual man, to be restricting the coming out process to the extent that he did “not feel 177  safe to talk about it out there in the corridor”. This kind of silence illustrates the power relation between the speakable/heterosexuality and the unspeakable/homosexuality whereby the silencing of sexual minorities’ voices is facilitated by the underlying assumptions around ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ embedded within the academy (Butler, 1999; Priola et al, 2014).   As such, in negotiating the “just like heterosexuals” discourse reproduced in the academy as ‘normative’, non-straight participants developed coping strategies to avoid disrupting the heteronormativity of the academy (Richardson, 2004). For example, ‘coming out’, participants reflexively decided on ‘appropriate’ aspects to ‘disclose’ and metaphorically ‘bring to work’ and the identity factors that were ‘left at home’. This process was further negotiated through ‘acceptance’ or ‘appropriateness’ regulated by a heteronormative discourse. The discursive construct of ‘acceptance’ to bring sexuality to work was found to be regulated by appropriate gender norms which will be discussed in Section 8.3.2, and relationships that mirror heterosexual coupledom such as marriage, monogamy and families (Monro et al, 2017).   In discussions around the participants’ private lives, it became apparent that heteronormativity was challenged, troubled and redefined whereby participants constructed friends as their families, were in queer and polygamous relationships, not having close ties with their ‘blood families’, not wanting to have children, or having children through self-insemination. As such, all of these practices disrupt the notion of gender as a structuring aspect of family relations (Weeks, 2001). For example, in not having close relationships with their ‘birth families’, several participants constructed friends, such as those in their immediate social group, as their families, which has been theorised by Roseneil and Budgon’s (2004) as “family of choice” that marks a move away from the heteronormative ‘nuclear family’. Additionally, Grace, a self-identified bisexual woman, had a child through donor-insemination. However, due to the implicit norm around heterosexuality, she found it difficult to talk about the relationships in her private sphere in the academy, as people would assume she was straight when talking about her daughter and partner. As such, the findings demonstrate that these alternative family structures troubled the notion of a stable gender by constructing an ‘ontological crisis’ both in sexuality and language whereby masculinity and femininity are deconstructed as the ‘core’ of parenthood and family structure (Butler, 1999). Linking back to the academy, the ontological disruptions created by LGBTQIA families make visible the naturalness of normative families and their inherited heterogendered norms (Pringle, 178  2008) that makes it difficult for LGBTQIA academics to discuss their private lives as ‘valid’ lives in the academy.   While ‘wearing’ sexuality on their sleeves was acceptable in the private sphere, people were constructing sexuality as a private identity at work leaving people to become “respectably queer or homonormative” (Morrish and O’Mara, 2011:985). For example, having a long-term partner was argued by gay and lesbian participants to facilitate the coming out process, thus could be read as ‘homonormative’ without being ‘obviously gay’ (Ida, self-identified lesbian woman). However, Ash, a self-identified queer/genderqueer, argued that they could not talk about their non-monogamous relationships in the way that straight academics would discuss their lives, thus talked about what they did over the weekend with their ‘friends’ rather than ‘partner(s)’. This poses difficulties to bring sexuality to the discussion due to the heteronormative linguistic discourse in which people refer to their ‘boyfriend’ or ‘girlfriend’, thus creating an entry into a heterosexual/homosexual discursive construct of a binary (Benozzo et al, 2015). Although ‘partner’ or ‘friend’ could be referred to in order to deconstruct the heterosexual presumption in conversations with colleagues, ‘partner’ often requires a specification of the pronouns of the partner, thus (re)producing binaries and monogamy not leaving room for queer, bisexual, pansexual, non-monogamous lives (Benozzo et al, 2015). While lesbian and gay men who adopt monogamous norms, constructed and sustained by heteronormativity, might claim ‘normalcy’ by assimilation, the current study contributes with understandings of the ways in which bisexual, pan and queer polygamous people perceived themselves to be rendered outside the logic of what is considered ‘appropriate’ (Monro et al, 2017).   Additionally, whereas several participants argued straight academic men would socialise by talking about dating students, it was stressed that LGBTQIA dating was a silenced topic, which is conditioned by heteronormative discourse reproducing heterosexual dating as the ‘norm’. Participants therefore engaged in practices set by the people with institutional power, meaning “straight” men, to ‘leave their sexuality’ at home, as academics ‘with a sexuality’ were perceived to not ‘fit in’. The valued “invisibility” of sexuality is supported by research conducted by Morrish and O’Mara (2011:976), who found that universities strategically position queerness as ‘invisible’ “lest they bring universities and colleges into disrepute”. For example, George argued that identifying as bisexual was an important aspect of his private identity, however, he reflexively decided to ‘leave’ sexuality at the doorstep as he felt ‘the need to sort of conform in that traditional 179  sense to just live up to the presumption that I am straight’. As such, the current research supports Pringle’s (2008) findings that it is important to create a culture that disrupts dominant heterosexuality in order for LGBTQIA academics to create a unity between academics’ ‘objective’ (public) and ‘subjective’ (private) selves. Following a “just like heterosexuals” discourse, the current findings suggests academics engaged in practices to ‘pass’ as the ‘normal academic’, which is further discussed in the next section.   8.3.2 The ‘normal’ academic: ‘just like heterosexuals’ One of the constraints for LGBTQIA identities to develop in the academy is heterogendered embodiment as the findings illustrate that gender is inextricably linked to (hetero)sexuality where to be recognized as a viable gendered subject means complying with hegemonic masculinities or femininities (Pringle, 2008: Schippers, 2007). For example, Adam, Eric, Barnaby, George and Anthony argued in Section 6.2 coming out as ‘gay’, ‘bisexual’ or ‘hetero-asexual’ would imply no longer being read as ‘real’ men. This resulted in creating a damaging and false distinction between ‘real men’ and ‘non-men’ that further necessitated (hetero)masculinities to be performed in the academy. For example, Anthony stated that he ‘performed straightness very convincingly’ while George argued he benefitted from ‘living up to the presumption that I’m straight’. Thus, in order to gain equal citizenship status as heterosexuals, non-straight participants felt they had to assimilate into a straight culture by not being visibly queer (Richardson, 2004). Living up to perceived straightness, as discussed above, demonstrates the privilege attached to “straight” performance in the academy that is rooted in heteronormative assumptions around marriage, heterosexual masculinity, sexist banter and ‘normative’ family life.   Similar to Butler’s (1993) argument that the performative act of naming a ‘girl’ initiates a citation of the (hetero)norm to remain a viable subject, an ‘academic’ is compelled to cite the (hetero)sexual and (normative)gendered norms in order to qualify as an academic (Fisher, 2007). This constructs macho ‘gays’ and ‘femme’ lesbians as unimaginable, viewpoints that have changed in the contemporary society due to processes of assimilation to ‘normalcy’ (Richardson, 2007). The current research highlights the processes of assimilation to heterogendered embodiment in academia where certain bodies and gendered expressions are accepted as long as LGBTQIA people reproduce heterosexual femininities and masculinities. For example, George, Brian and Adam argued that they could easily ‘pass’ as straight without having to ‘change anything overtly’. The practices involved in maintaining a passable “straight” subject reflect the imitative processes 180  whereby the idealisation of the heterosexual gender is both produced and subverted as ‘natural’ (Butler, 1993).    The compliance with normative heterosexual femininity was also negotiated in self-identified women’s narratives. For example Dorothy, a self-identified gender-neutral lesbian, felt they had to dress ‘girlier’ when presenting a poster on sexual minority women at a conference to be perceived approachable by other academics. Additionally, both Ida (self-identified lesbian woman) and Abigail (self-identified straight woman) adapted other practices deemed appropriate for women such as smiling more, talking differently to men and the need to be a ‘people pleaser’. As such, they were ‘playing the game’ by using their bodies to gain credibility as intelligible gendered subjects within the academy (Haynes, 2012). The negotiations of femininities among lesbian people have been suggested to be a constant battle as found in Woodruffe-Burton and Bairstow’s (2013) ethnographic study whereby butch embodiment was perceived to negatively affect the likelihood to be appointed a job.   As such, the discussions from sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 illustrate how academia is constructed by and through a heteronormative discourse whereby people should not ‘flaunt’ their sexuality. Academics are thus expected to leave sexuality at the doorstep, which echoes findings from research conducted on sexuality in masculinized industries (Willis, 2011). However, this does not mean that straight identifying people do not negotiate (hetero)norms at work to be read as ‘normal’, as Section 6.5.2 discussed how they continually make choices to repress the ‘abject signifier’ meaning for example ‘camp’ identifications (Butler, 1999). These citations are argued to be necessary in order to construct a ‘normal sense of self’ meaning ‘just like heterosexuals’ (Benozzo et al, 2015; Ozturk and Rumens, 2014). Answering objective two, the findings presented in sections 8.2 and 8.3 demonstrate adapting a “normal” academic identity leaves LGBTQIA people with two choices. Either, people can comply with ‘normative’ views of heterosexuality hence navigate academia as (in)visibly ‘queer’ or perform queerness hence risk being marginalised in the wider heteronormative life of academia (Rumens, 2016a).  8.4 Contextual practices constraining the development of an ‘academic with a sexuality’ This section seeks to answer research objective three, namely the contextual factors contributing to inequality among LGBTQIA academics. Although heteronormative practices were identified as the main discursive power constraining the development of non-heterosexual subjectivities, 181  heternormativity was also embedded in the functioning of the academy and its inherited institutional practices restricting the opportunity to create “an academy of queers” (Parker, 2002:162). The analysis found three contextual practices constraining the development of an “academic with a sexuality” including the norms embedded within the “gentlemen’s club”, the disqualification of femininities and knowledge production, discussed accordingly below.   8.4.1 The academic ‘gentlemen’s club’ Adding to the understanding of how certain ‘normative’ practices are (re)produced to constrain the development of alternative queer academic identities, the analysis found heterosexual masculinity was constituted as ‘normal’ in homosocial bonding. For example, heterosexual masculinity was ‘done’ and negotiated through a sexist discourse where “straight” academics used sexist language rating the attractiveness of female staff and students to secure their domination of women and other groups of men, paradoxically restricting opportunities to bring queer dating into the discussion. Tucker, a self-identified straight man, argued that heterosexual men in his department socialised by complaining about family, pay, rating women’s attractiveness and excluded ‘other’ staff researching non-conventional topics such as LGBTQIA issues. This finding contributes to performativity theory with an understanding of the performative enactment of straight masculinity as not static but rather constructed as an ‘impossible ideal’ (Nayak and Kehily, 2006:464) that is regulated and performed in coherence with norms in the academy to make it appear ‘normative’. As such, women and ‘out’ non-straight men was found to be excluded from the academic gentleman’s club (Fisher and Kinsey, 2014) which works to maintain the heteronormative ‘status quo’ of perceived or assumed ‘natural’ straightness and coherence between sex/gender/sexuality (Hammarèn and Johansson, 2014).   Additionally, this research found heterosexual masculinity to not only be constructed as a privileged performance of gender associated with the ‘ideal’ academic; heterosexuality was rewarded through spouse packages and pensions that were perceived as not being available to non-straight performing academics. This coincides with Fisher and Kinsey’s (2014) findings that homosociality remains a powerful feature of British universities that facilitate privilege, career progressions and increased career trajectory by promoting and rewarding masculine norms (Wahl, 2014). This ‘doing’ of strict and rigid gendered norms in the academy could be due to the underlying assumption that organisational cultures are taken for granted to be “men’s cultures” (Hearn and Collinson, 1998) whereby the dominant group of men create gendered norms of 182  acceptability for people within the hegemonic group and subgroups (Lusher and Robins, 2009). It was therefore found that academia’s white, straight, research active, ‘older’ gentleman’s club had the power to create knowledge associated with what counts as ‘academic’ and ‘other’. Self-identified gay participants in the current study thus found it easier to develop cross-gendered friendships, as women were perceived as being more educated on feminism making bonding easier, which echoes Rumens (2012) research on gay and bisexual workplace friendship. Thus the current study found that the academic gentleman’s club excluded men associated with femininities and further suppressed women by sexualising their bodies to the extent that self-identified women negotiated sexism when positioning themselves as ‘women’.  8.4.2 The disqualified feminine academics’ body  Although ‘the’ body has often been invisible in management studies, this research illustrates how certain bodies are made visible in the academy. As discussed in Section 8.3.2, coming out as ‘non heterosexual’ was perceived by the self-identified male participants to imply being perceived as ‘feminine’ (Connell, 2005), which is a gendered expression that was constructed as unwelcome in a (hetero)masculine culture such as academia. Additionally, in Section 6.5.1, it was stressed that academia sought to facilitate the interests of straight, white men, who was constructed as the proper ‘business persona’ that academics should aspire to conform to. In this manner, it could be argued that women and people deviating from the ‘straight, masculine, white norm’, have bodies that cannot be read to comply with ‘professionalism’ or the academic ‘business persona’ (Humphrey, 1999). This was also reflected on in the self-identified female academics’ experiences, and the experiences of academics’ perceived as female, with sexism as they felt their bodies were made visible because the masculine, straight, male body is constructed as the “invisible and unmarked norm” of the academy (Fotaki, 2013:16), resulting in overt sexism as discussed in Section 6.5.2.  From a queer theoretical perspective, the issue is not the ‘male’ body per se, it is rather the (re)production of the idealised embodiment of heterogender (Pringle, 2008) that constructs straight, masculine men as the ‘norm’, where people seen as ‘deviating’ are cast as the opposite of the ‘ideal academic’. However, the normative views of constructing femininity as a ‘female’ trait reproduce the idea of a stable, essentialist identity constructing masculinity as a privileged and dominant expression ‘belonging’ to the ‘male’ body. As such, George, Anthony, Adam and Barnaby constructed sexuality as a private identity in Section 6.2. Although they could disrupt heteronormativity by taking on a ‘camp’ approach to masculinity in the private sphere, this ‘doing’ 183  of gender was not possible if they wanted to navigate the academy as ‘professional’. However, as has been noted elsewhere (Benozzo et al, 2015; Ozturk and Rumens, 2014), ‘camp’ is often constructed as being disconnected from the discourse of ‘professionalism’ as ‘camp’ identifications are often conflated with ‘femininity’. Thus, adhering to professionalism means concealing private identities and conforming to a heterosexual ideal of masculinity. Hence coming out in the academy shows how knowledge/power systems (re)produces a problematic hierarchy of ‘real men’ and ‘real academics’ between groups of men and between men and women, disqualifying the feminine body (de Boise, 2015).    Additionally, Schippers (2007:94) has argued the hierarchal oppositions between femininity and masculinity mean hegemonic masculinity can be defined as “the qualities defined as manly” that construct and validate the subordination by men of women by positioning femininity in relation to masculinity. As such, participants, in particular the self-identified male respondents, undertook identity work to repress any association with femininity as discussed in Section 6.3.2. For example, George did not want to ask for help as he saw that as weakening ‘his’ masculinity, while Adam distanced himself from brands and colours, such as pink, which he constructed as ‘seen as for women’. Additionally, Eric did not talk about his lack of sex-drive as sexual activity is perceived as tied with the discourse of hegemonic masculinity. These so-called ‘manly qualities’ were found to be reinforced in discourse, social practices and interactions and were constructed as a continuous negotiation in navigating the academy (Stone and Shapiro, 2017).   Thus similar to Richardson’s (2015:5) argument that citizenship is constructed in relation to ‘hegemonic forms of heterosexuality’, this study shows how such normative underpinnings construct a sense of exclusion and inclusion within UK academic institutions where to be a ‘proper’ academic implies being heterosexual and enacting certain normative forms of masculinity. Concurring Fotaki’s (2011:47) argument that within the academic context, women cannot occupy ‘the neutral gender-less academic persona’ as ‘the body’ equates the ‘female sex’, this study found that people associated with femininity are alienated in the disembodied culture of the academy. That is not to say that gendered norms are not prevalent in the academy, however, as seen in Section 7.2, the perceived disembodied ‘nature’ of the academy seeks to silence academics that are not conforming to the straight, middle class, white, masculine ‘male’ norms of domination. As such, this research suggests that it is not only the female body that introduces the body to the workplace 184  (Acker, 1990), but rather any associations/embodiment of femininity that is made apparent in interactions with students and colleagues and in the everyday life of academia.    8.4.3 Knowledge production Not only was the feminine body constructed as abject and unintelligible (Butler, 1999) in the academic context, the voices of people associated with femininity, meaning gay, bisexual, lesbian, asexual men and women were further rendered invalid and disqualified. The current research found that increased pressure to apply for research grants presents particular disadvantages for academics whose research interest does not match the traditional, masculine ideal that are thought to generate the highest income (Deem, 2003) as sexuality research was often perceived as ‘niche’ interests. This has been supported by research conducted by Ozturk and Rumens (2014) and LaSala et al (2008) who argued that although sexuality research is a vital step towards challenging academic heteronormativity, queer theory is thought to be an uncomfortable research topic for the heterosexual ‘male’ hegemony that further might restrict career opportunities for those undertaking such research.   As such, when research oriented towards LGBTQIA matters is constructed as a risky business for career advancement, heteronormativity is (re)produced as ‘normal’ and ‘common’ knowledge and its power remains intact. In this manner, academic knowledge production cannot be considered as gender neutral but rather, as Fotaki (2011:43) suggests ‘performed through gendered power relationships’. Thus, the current findings illustrate the role heteronormativity plays in creating heterogendered roles in the academy whereby participants constructed white, heterosexual men as the ideal worker and transmitters of knowledge. Because most of the top positions in academia tend to be dominated by straight, white men, it was argued that ‘straight academic males’ had the power to (re)produce heteronormativity (Alice, self-identified bisexual woman). As such, the current research adds to the understanding of the implicit reproduction of heteronormativity in the academy as men are more likely to gain scientific prices and recognition of their publications than women (Johansson and Sliwa, 2014) and non-straight academics.   However, as discussed in Section 6.3, it was found that coming out was difficult in a heterosexual, male, masculine promoting context, like academia, as discussions around academics’ private life was restricted and embodiment was forcibly performed in relation to ‘heterogender’ (Pringle, 2008). As such, sexuality research was constructed as a way to come out, and ‘do’ queerness in the 185  academy. However, when knowledge is constructed within a new managerialist discourse to repress ‘non-normative’ voices to facilitate the one-dimensionality agenda of ‘thinking inside the box’ (Klikauer, 2015:1115) it means that certain lives remain silenced and unacknowledged as ‘liveable’ (Butler, 1999). Additionally, when ‘valid’ research is constructed around ‘male’ perceptions of ‘success’ (Knights and Richards, 2003) participants engaged in identity work to downplay difference from straight men, as for example, George argued that ‘I feel that for a career in academia, it is potentially to my advantage to not be so openly bisexual’. Again, coming out is tied within knowledge/power regime whereby straight, masculine men are seen as ‘professional’ thus resulting in women and non-straight men risking losing power and academic validity. In this manner, marginalised voices and experiences do not get transmitted as universities are found to be structured around “what sells in the marketplace” whereby minorities’ voices to the heterosexual majority are viewed as less strategic (Skelton, 1998:120). However, in order to challenge heteronormative practices embedded within academia, Ozturk and Rumens (2014) have argued that it is vital to (re)constitute sexuality research as creditable and valid research areas.   8.5 Queering queer theory: towards bisexual inclusion In order to address objective four, this section will discuss the experiences of academics identifying with non-binary sexualities, in particular self-identified bisexual academics’ experiences, through the lens of queer theory’s performativity theory (Butler, 1999). There is a paucity in the sexuality literature, as the extant workplace literature on sexuality have been criticised for neglecting to incorporate the experiences of bisexual people (Worthen, 2013; Anteby and Anderson, 2014) and their exclusion is particularly evident within a queer theoretical framework (Callis, 2009; Feldman, 2009; Erickson-Scroth and Mitchell, 2009; Namaste, 1994; Angelides, 2006). Whereas Sedgwick (1990) and Rubin (1975) proposed an analytic separation between gender and sexuality to study the experiences of LGBT people, this separation has been criticised for neglecting the experiences of bisexual and lesbian women centring the gay ‘male’ subject as universal to which queer theory applies (Chevrette, 2013; Walters, 1996). There is thus a scarcity in the extant literature on the experiences of self-identified bisexuals, and bisexual women in particular. Additionally, to date, there is no empirical research focusing on the experiences of academics identifying with non-binary sexualities (bisexual, pansexual, queer), although research on gay male academics has been conducted (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014).  186  Furthermore, as discussed in Section 6.2.2, the current study found bisexuals experience higher levels of negative stereotypes in the academy than do lesbians and gay men, which is supported by the extant literature (McCormack et al, 2014). The current research further demonstrates that self-identified bisexuals experience stigmatisation and marginalisation in lesbian and gay communities in addition to navigating the heteronormative environments of academia ‘assumed’ as straight. As such, it was evident that self-identified bisexuals experience ‘double discrimination’ as they might not be able to access privilege as ‘straight’ and simultaneously not always gain access to gay and lesbian networks in the academy due to being ‘placed’ inside/outside the homosexual/heterosexual binary (Beckett, 2012; Callis, 2009). In this manner, the findings presented in Chapter Seven illustrate how self-identified bisexual academics can either pass as “invisible” or being read as “radical” by adopting a queer, pansexual or non-binary identity, which will be discussed in sections 8.5.1 and 8.5.2.   8.5.1 The invisible bisexual body The current research found bisexual women having two choices navigating academia; to either pass as straight, or conform to a ‘butch’ look. However, rather than becoming visible ‘as bisexual’, self-identified bisexual women often become ‘invisible’ in negotiating the heterosexual/homosexual binary reproduced in the academy. Discussions in Section 7.2.3 demonstrated how bisexual women constructed certain demeanours, such as short hair and check-shirts as signifiers of gay and non-conforming identities while long hair, dressing in pink and flowers was constructed as signifying heterosexual femininity. Paradoxically, it was found that doing ‘butchness’ or ‘straightness’ does not discursively position bisexuality as ‘visible’, but rather (re)produces bisexuality as invisible within the hetero-homonormative binary discourse. This finding is supported by the research conducted by Hayfield et al (2013) on bisexuals’ experiences negotiating femininities and masculinities in constructing a ‘viable’ queer identity. However, when bisexuality ‘fails’ to legitimise itself through performativity to qualify as ‘being’, bisexuality is excluded as a ‘liveable’ signification (Butler, 1993), which was evident in Ash’s narrative of feeling alienated in the academic institution, discussed in Section 7.3.3.   Findings illustrate that the absence of stereotypes to be ‘read’ as bisexual meant self-identified bisexual women were either read as “straight” or ‘lesbian’. However, not complying with ‘butch’ looks meant bisexual women had been pushed out from LGBTQIA networks in the academy as a consequence of ‘looking too straight’ or ‘not queer enough’ as seen in Section 7.2.3. This restricts 187  bisexuals from disclosing their sexuality, as bisexuality have been argued to be a ‘non-legitimate’ sexuality where bisexual individuals are assumed to be ‘confused’ about their sexual orientation as it is regarded as “just a phase”  (Eliason, 2000; Barker and Langdridge, 2008). Self-identified bisexuals, therefore, argued they were often forced into a ‘bisexual closet’ as the power held by lesbian/gay communities often constructed ‘bisexuality’ as a transition into ‘straightness’. It is evident from the findings presented in Chapter Six and Seven there exists a hierarchy of acceptance within groups and across groups and that acceptance is further regulated by gender norms in the academy (Rumens, 2016a). For example, the current findings suggest bisexuals are less accepted than lesbian and gay men in the LGBT community (Monro et al, 2017), however, ‘queer’ women are further marginalised within the bisexual community, which is discussed in Section 8.5.2.   In this manner, self-identified bisexual participants argued that within the academy and dominant heteronormative society, they were ‘read’ as either lesbian or straight depending on the gender of the person they were dating. For example, as discussed in sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.3, Grace and Drew, argued they often had to ‘justify’ their sexuality, particularly as they both were in relationships with men hence read as “straight” by default. Whereas Pringle (2008) and Benozzo et al (2015) found that lesbian and gay men’s visibility in the workplace is facilitated by their partnerships or having children, the narratives provided by bisexual men and women academics in this study shows how the hetero-homosexual binary restricts possibilities for (bi)visibility. As such, women in “straight” passing relationships found their gender expressions were read as complying with straightness unless ‘bisexuality’ was performatively enacted through speech acts. The findings illustrate that the oppositional straight/gay binary system that renders the former the ‘master signifier’ and the latter the ‘absent’ seeks to guarantee that an intermixture of the categories remains impossible to ensure straightness remains the ‘normative’ (Nayak and Kehily, 2006:466).   Research has shown gay men and lesbian women who challenge the heterosexual matrix risk being articulated as ‘abject’ or ‘unintelligibly’ gendered (Bowring and Brewis, 2009). The current study contributes towards the limited knowledge about how bisexuals articulate the sex, gender, sexuality nexus and how these practices might be read as subverting or troubling the hetero/homo binary that heteronormative discourse seeks to (re)produce. For example, Butler’s (1999) performativity theory argues that people who reject the sex-gender-sexuality nexus risk portraying a gender that cannot be read as intelligible by the “norm”. In experiencing sexism, the current study found that self-identified bisexual women could be viewed as ‘intelligible’ in the patriarchy by being attracted 188  hence subordinated to men thus ‘read’ as women. However, being attracted to women, men, trans* and non-binary identifications ‘other’ sex-gender possibilities occurred (Nayak and Kehily, 2006). The current research adds to Callis’ (2009) call for research to incorporate bisexuality to the performativity theory. For example, the current research demonstrates how femme bisexuals’ demeanour installs them in the heterosexual matrix, however, by being attracted to women, trans* and non-binary people, femme bisexuals fail to ‘legitimate and sustain’ their desire as culturally intelligible, thus causing gender trouble (Butler, 1993:159). The current study shows how the academy constructs norms that push women to act feminine, and any diversion from heterosexual femininity, such as butch embodiment amongst lesbian and bisexual women, are seen as a threat to the heterosexual ‘male’ patriarchy or dominance.   Butler (1999) theorises femme lesbians’ desires for butch women as “erotic interplay”. However, the current research shows ‘feminine bisexuals’ who ‘resist’ the heterosexual label perceived themselves to be further stigmatised and subjected to sexism as a consequence of conforming to heterosexual ideals of femininity but paradoxically avoiding the subordination to men (as they are seen to ideally be desiring men). As discussed in Section 7.2.3, bisexuality was perceived by self-identified bisexual women as a sexualised identity who argued their bodies became sexed as men treated them as ‘women’ through sexism and oppression. For example, Charlotte, a self-identified bisexual trans woman, argued their experiences of street harassment and sexism by men could be perceived as a way of ‘validating’ her identity as ‘female passing’. However, from a queer theoretical perspective, being read as ‘intelligibly’ gendered means that femme bisexuals were ‘read’ as complying with heterosexual femininity thus foreclosing the possibility of bisexuality, as discussed in Section 7.3.2. Paradoxically, in self-identifying as non-binary, women refuse to accept “the descriptions offered in the name of women” (Butler, 1993:221) thus destabilises the norms that control “the intelligibility of bodies” (Wilcox, 2017:807). However, if there exist no bisexual ‘acts’, how can bisexuality be performatively enacted to be ‘read’ as culturally intelligible or subvert the dominant heterosexual femininity/masculinity (Butler, 1999)? This will be discussed in the next section.   8.5.2 The ‘radically’ queer In this study, several straight and lesbian identifying participants argued that they have had ‘bisexual experiences’ but due to the stigmatisation associated with ‘bisexuality’ as ‘indecisive’, bisexuality was constructed as an ‘unsayable’ and ‘non-legitimate’ identity thus a radical 189  construction. This finding adds to Ozturk and Rumens’ (2014) research on gay men working in business schools whereby participants in their study constructed ‘gay’ as ‘normal’ and ‘queer’ as ‘radical’ by associating queerness with disruption to the gender order. Although ‘queer’ was a subject position constructed to disentangle the strict heterosexual matrix, ‘queer’ was argued by participants in Section 7.3.4 to remove the political battle ‘bisexuality’ had fought hard for, by subsuming bisexuals’ experiences under the ‘queer’ umbrella while neglecting gendered aspects. Thus the historical construct of ‘queer’ as an insult to LGBT people might still be argued to be associated with the word ‘queer’ (Namaste, 1998).   Additionally, discussions in Section 7.3.2 illustrate how the LGBT community was perceived to (re)enforce binaries by constructing ‘bisexuality’ as a term that only encompasses attraction towards women and/or men, hence constructing bisexuality as transphobic. In this manner, bisexuality was stereotypically constructed as equalling two genders tied with hetero- and cisnormativity. While most self-identifying lesbian and gay participants constructing ‘straightness’ as a starting point before identifying as lesbian or gay, it usually meant constructing the gender of the ‘object choice’ as ‘stable’. However, ‘bisexuality’ was constructed by self-identifying bisexuals to encompass attraction towards all gender expressions moving away from binarism. Due to the socially conditioned stereotypes of bisexuality as transphobic, participants reflexively referred to themselves as ‘queer’ or ‘pan’ in addition to ‘bisexual’, in order to uncouple the gender/sex categories to trouble the idea of an ontologically, pre-existing subject (Butler, 1999).   Compared to self-identified male participants, only self-identified women in this study identified as ‘queer’ or ‘pan’ identities, which were subject positions taken up to deconstruct cisnormativity. Adam, Barnaby, Anthony, Jack, James and Brian’s decision to not identity as ‘queer’ or ‘pan’ could be due to the assimilation strategy imposed by heteronormativity, where to come out as ‘gay’ is normative in the sense that it is not necessarily a radical identity, while ‘queer’ signifies a disruptive identification to the heterosexual/homosexual binary (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014). While ‘bisexuality’ was constructed by participants as lacking performative opportunities to ‘count as queer’, ‘pan’ and ‘queer’ were identifications allowing for a more ‘radical’ position to subvert binaries, thus causing further gender trouble. For example, Doris and Drew constructed ‘queer’ as a political identification that seeks to deconstruct cis- and heteronormativity, by recognizing that their gender identity is not conditioned by biology, but rather an on-going and performative accomplishment (Walters, 1996; Butler, 1999).  190   Whereas Pringle’s (2008) research on lesbian managers’ negotiation of heterogender found that lesbian mothers were seen as complying with heterosexual femininity through bearing children, which is constructed as a vital factor of women’s identities, the current study’s findings on bisexual mothers shows otherwise. For example, discussions from Section 6.5.3 on Doris’ experiences becoming a mother, but not the birthmother of her daughter, caused an ontological crisis to the construction of a ‘real mother’ and ‘real woman’, by missing the vocabulary to talk about their sexuality due to its complexity (Gray, 2013). Whereas Doris strongly self-identified as a femme bisexual and queer woman before having her daughter, she was treated as a man when having to take paternity leave, thus started questioning her belonging to the ‘female’ category. This finding illustrates an opportunity for queer bisexual women to deconstruct normative ideas of the mother/feminine axis belonging to the ‘female’ body, as she was doing gender in ways that could not be read as complying with either the ‘female’ nor the ‘male ‘body (Gabb, 2005). It can therefore be argued that the construction of ‘norms’ associated with the heterosexual family is transmitted to workplaces and lays the groundwork for the construction of family-friendly policies that do not take into account the potential for sex/gender to be dismantled away from heterosexual foundations.   Additionally, taking up a queer identity allowed Drew to challenge the underlying norms associated with conventional categories such as ‘woman’ (Walters, 1996) as she stated: ‘I have sort of questioned whether that is absolutely my gender identity. I can’t say that won’t change in the future’. Drawing on wider discourses of biology and sexism, Drew argued her breasts constructed her as ‘a woman’ and the experienced sexism associated with being ‘read’ as woman made her question her gender identity, which was a practice made possible by positioning herself as ‘queer’. In this construct of ‘woman’, breasts are a gendered construct of the ‘female’ body that becomes naturalised through ‘sexism’. However, in rejecting the compulsory coherence of sex, gender and sexuality, there is a risk of portraying a gender that is not regarded as intelligible by the ‘norm’ (Butler, 1999: Callis, 2009).   Even though Ash’s identifications challenge the hetero/homo, feminine/masculine, woman/man binaries, they drew upon discourses within the academic workplace to explain how academic institutions attempts to (re)produce heteronormative practices around traditional heterosexual femininities to be performed by women, for example through wearing makeup. By being read as 191  straight, Ash was often perceived as cis woman, which demonstrate how ‘being gendered’ implies being located within the power/knowledge discourse constructing ‘appropriate’ heterosexuality (Pringle, 2008). Additionally, by constructing a workplace based on essentialist assumptions about sexuality and gender, or heterogender, people assume that trans* and non-binary people, as in Ash’s narrative, automatically become “heterosexual” upon transitioning to woman or man (Dietert and Dentice, 2009).   However, Charlotte, a self-identified bisexual trans woman, did not construct her sexuality on either side of the spectrum, rather identifying with ‘bisexuality’. However, although queer theory assumes that adapting to a ‘queer’ identity could mean that people’s gender and sexuality could no longer be read as ‘fitting in’ on either side of the binary, it does not subvert the heterosexual matrix as people read both Ash and Charlotte as ‘female’ thus “straight”. As such, in answering objective four, it is evident that by incorporating queer theory to understand bisexual and non-binary sexuality formation, this research adds to Angelides (2006) call to incorporate gender to the examination of sexuality. This is because non-binary sexualities is an “important historical regulatory of the axes of gender and sexuality” (Angelides, 2006:151).   8.6 Conclusions To conclude, this chapter has sought to answer the research objectives first set out in Section 1.3 to demonstrate how heteronormativity is constructed in the academy as ‘normal’ and to identify the discourses involved in maintaining and constructing a ‘normal’ academic ‘self’. The current research adds to academic literature by making visible the ways in which the institutional power held by academia silences queer voices by (re)producing available dominant discourses that continue to serve interests of the hegemony. For example, the findings indicate the struggle faced by academics undertaking sexuality and gender research in legitimizing their knowledge as value-adding, particularly as these areas were perceived as ‘niche’ and ‘uncomfortable’ research areas to the heterosexual majority. Thus, the current research contributes to the literature on academic ‘new managerialism’ (Steinbórsdóttir et al, 2019) with an understanding of how implementations of performance management to monitor ‘excellence’ are not only gendered but also sexualised.   Additionally, this research aimed to answer Ozturk and Rumen’s (2014) call for research that ‘queers’ knowledge in higher education while disrupting the hetero-homosexual binary to enable queer identities and voices. As such, this research challenges ontological understanding of stable 192  identities, categories and subjects by drawing on a queer theoretical perspective. For example, this research shows that masculinities and femininities are not fixed or rooted in ‘female’ or ‘male’ bodies. Whereas Fotaki’s (2011) research argues that it is ‘female’ body in the academy that makes the body visible, the current research found that any associations with ‘femininity’ position bodies as ‘transgressing academic professionalism’, as seen in gay, bisexual and asexual men’s experiences.   However, bisexual academics perceived as ‘female’ experienced further oppression and sexism in the academy due to the intersection of ‘femininity’, ‘bisexuality’ and ‘female sex’ whereby they were read as conforming to heterosexual ideals of femininity while paradoxically avoiding the subordination to men. Consequently, self-identified bisexual women, drawing on ‘queer’ and ‘pansexual’ subject positions, constructed their gender and sexualities as unstable by deconstructing femininities as only associated with the ‘female’ body. As bisexuality and non-binary sexualities tend to be neglected from queer theory (Callis, 2009), the current research sought to fill this gap by incorporating queer theory to the discussion of how non-binary sexualities performatively ‘do’ or ‘undo’ gender. Thus, this research contributes to theory by incorporating bisexuality to performativity theory in order to understand how sexuality can deconstruct gender as binary while understanding the logics of being located outside the heterosexual/homosexual dichotomy. As such, the next chapter will provide the concluding remarks as well as the research implications and areas for further research.   193  Chapter 9 Conclusions   9.1 Introduction Combining the preceding critical workplace chapters, theory chapter, research methodology and findings chapters, the final chapter seeks to provide the concluding remarks. As such, the chapter is structured accordingly: firstly, a research summary is outlined, following an attempt to answer the objectives and how they were addressed. Next, the contributions will be explicitly outlined in order to discuss the implications of discursive constructs of gender and sexuality in the academy. Finally the research limitations and the areas for future research will be explored.   9.2 The current research: A summary The context chapter and workplace chapter discussed the ways in which organizational research tend to rely on normative thus stable categories to theorise gender and sexuality. Drawing on queer theory, in particular canonical queer theorist Judith Butler’s (1999) performativity theory, the current research found a person ‘is’ not ‘gay’, “straight” or ‘queer’, but is rather a constant ‘doing’ of, for example, ‘straightness’ or ‘queerness’ that is fluid and open for re-citation (Lloyd, 1999).  Thus, following Butler’s (1999) processual ontology, the current research methodology was designed to avoid essentialising identities into categories and rather focused on how these categories were deployed by academic respondents in the interviews viewing them as multiple and unstable terms (de Souza et al, 2016). This thesis thus aimed to understand how academics navigate working life in workplaces where discourses around ‘heterosexuality’ are the implicit norm. Informing this research, underpinned by a queer theoretical lens, the following research questions were devised:  • What discursive arrangements constrain and enable the development of LGBTQIA and heterosexual identities in academia? • What happens to LGBTQIA and heterosexual people whose sexual and gender performance violate normative genders and sexual discourses in academia? • How do bisexuals, and non-binary sexualities understand their subjects in relation to the hetero/homo binary? In what way does this binary enable and constrain gendered and sexual subjectivities to be performatively enacted?  As post-structuralists argue that “language constructs that which is being investigated” (Lather, 194  1992:94), the objectives discussed below were addressed using qualitative semi-structured interviews inspired by Riach et al’s (2016) anti-narrative approach. Thus, drawing on a post-structuralist paradigm, the 30 participants recruited through snowball sampling were conducted over a four-month period with academics identifying across the gender and sexuality spectrum. The aim of the interviews was to unravel the ways in which power and knowledge is reinforced through categorizations and how the subjects are constructed through discourses by deconstructing academic normativity (Grant and Giddings, 2002). The findings were analysed inductively looking for discourses and using Willig’s (2013) Foucauldian Discourse Analysis in order to expose the implications of heteronormativity for academics working in UK higher education. The analysis found academic (hetero)masculinity, new managerialism and knowledge production are discourses allowing certain subject positions to be taken up, which further implicates academics’ workplace experiences and subjectivities (Willig, 2013), discussed in Chapters Six and Seven. Rather than there being a ‘real’ category of investigation, associated with much positivist research, the current research stressed the importance of understanding how sexual and gendered categories are discursive constructs that change over time as the institutions, such as academia, that constructs them change. This chapter will move on to discuss the objectives.   9.3 “To understand the role sexuality plays in academics’ working lives” As discussed in Section 6.2, sexuality was constructed as playing a significant role in academics’ private lives. However, although some universities have started to discuss issues around sexuality, the current research contributes to the understanding that inclusion in the academy is facilitated by (hetero)masculine norms resulting in exclusion of academics that were perceived to “flaunt their diversity” (Priola et al, 2018:747; Tierney, 1997). The current study found academics implicitly silencing or downplaying certain aspects of their private lives in workplace interactions, for example by navigating academia as ‘assumed’ straight, using gender-neutral terms such as ‘partner’, talking excessively or silencing discussions about their families (i.e. having children) to minimise difference from the ‘norm’. Section 6.3.1 discussed the ways in which academics were forced to leave ‘diversity’ at their doorsteps, as sexuality has been constructed as a private concern (Bowring and Brewis, 2009). Paradoxically, the current research contributes to the body of academic labour on how non-normative sexualities can disrupt and make visible the institutional structures and practices constructing academia as sexually-neutral. To demonstrate, Doris, a self-identified queer bisexual woman as noted in Section 6.5.3, could be read as complying with the norms set out by the heterosexual matrix (Butler, 1999) thus seen as complying with the objective 195  idea of gender, without causing gender trouble in the academy. However, in requesting parental leave, but not as the biological mother, her gender could not be read as intelligible as her sexuality questioned the feminine-mum-heterosexual axis creating appropriate norms for who count as ‘real’ mums and ‘other’, thus making visible the subjective gender.   As such, the current research contributes in problematizing the private/public or subjective/objective constructs of gender and sexuality were for example being assumed straight until the ‘other’ is made apparent contributes in making visible the subjective ‘self’ previously belonging in the private sphere (Pringle, 2008). However, dismantling the private/public binary rendered certain embodiments of gender and sexuality unintelligible (Rumens and Kerfoot 2009). The current study contributes to the body of academic literature on heteronormativity, which find heteronormativity (re)produced and maintained as ‘normative’ in the academy by promoting a separation between private lives and work lives unless private matters such as transitioning, parental leave etc. needed to be voiced to management. To answer objective one, the study found that in order to navigate academia as ‘intelligible’ academics, the participants felt they had to downplay queerness in order to construct an academic thus professional ‘self’. Thus the research addresses Pullen et al’s (2016:5) call for “an organizational sexology informed by queer theory which surfaces the tensions between individual and organizational self”.   9.4 “To uncover the ways in which academics negotiate discourses of heteronormativity and how heteronormativity constructs sexualities deemed ‘normal’” As seen in Section 6.3.2, the current study demonstrates academic ‘normality’ relies on practices seen as non-disrupting to the (hetero)masculine discourse that legitimises certain social practices as ‘normal’. For example, being positioned as ‘sexual’ within a heteronormative discourse implies that the academic body becomes a visible object read as transgressing institutional structures of what is constituted as ‘normative’. In order to avoid constructing ‘straightness’ as an implicit ‘norm’ in the academy in which non-straight academics are read as the ‘abnormal’, the current research contributes to the critique of management and organizational research, drawing on queer theory, for overlooking “both heterosexuality’s coercive aspects and its non-normative forms” (Rumens et al, 2019:593). For example, ‘normative’ heterosexual-masculinity in the academy was constructed as “not being sexual”, “not wearing pink”, “not talking about lack of sex drive”, “rating the attractiveness of female staff and students”, “not researching ‘feminine’ subjects” and “not challenging ‘male’ reading lists”. Rather than being associated with a stable “heterosexual” 196  identity, these practices contributes in illustrating how normalization processes not only constructs people read as deviating from the ‘norm’, but also how normalization affects and produces the ‘norm’, in this case a perceived fixed ‘heterosexual’ identity (Rumens et al, 2019). As such, the reiterative practices of heterosexual constructs in non-straight frames “bring into relief the utterly constructed status of the heterosexual original” (Lloyd, 1999:198) demonstrating how straightness itself is a copy, thus making lesbian, gay and bisexual constructs a copy of a copy (Butler, 1999).   This research adds to the empirical studies on how gay, asexual, bisexual and heterosexual men can claim status as ‘true’ men through performatively distancing themselves from the “inferior feminine form” (Schippers, 2007:97). This contributes in reproducing new dichotomies where ‘gay straightness’ is positioned in relation to ‘gay queerness’ whereby the latter is rendered the abject “other”. Additionally, contributing towards the understanding of how lesbian, bisexual and straight women negotiate heteronormative embodiments (Woodruffe-Burton and Bairstow, 2013), the current research found women downplayed ‘butch’ expressions in order to avoid projecting queerness in the academy. Although gender and sexuality can be studied separately, the current research demonstrates how academics navigate heteronormativity by creating a unified picture of real women or men whereby the reiterative practices illustrate how gender is falsely naturalised through the regulatory fiction of heterosexual coherence (Butler, 1999). Thus, echoing Pringle’s (2008) theorisation of gender in management as ‘heterogender’, this research shows that viewing gender as ‘heterogender’ allows for an examination of how gender is performatively enacted in the academy whereby sexuality directly influences gender. Thus, in answering objective two, the study found participants, regardless of sexuality, attempted to avoid embodiments associated with a stereotypical butch or camp identity to blend into the sexually neutral academic world as intelligibly gendered professional academics (Rumens and Kerfoot, 2009).  9.5 “To investigate the contextual factors contributing to workplace (in)equality encountered by LGBTQIA and heterosexual academics in UK Higher Education” Although heteronormativity is not always explicitly prevalent in the functioning of the academy, it was evident in the lack of research and voices given to queer academics whereby sexually-neutrality becomes the “regimes of truth” (Foucault, 1979; Stein and Plummer, 1994:183). By neglecting queer voices and constructing non-traditional research matters such as LGBTQIA peoples’ experiences as ‘niche’, heterosexuality is not only reproduced but also undisrupted as “normal” (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014) as the current study found “straight” passing knowledge to 197  legitimize academic validity. However, although discourses around sexuality change over time, the current research contributes to the understanding of how the lack of queer voices in the academy (re)produces available dominant discourses that continue to serve the interests of hegemonic social groups. In this manner, the majority of academics participating in the current research, in particular self-identified gay and bisexual men, argued that for a career in academia, it was potentially an advantage to not be openly queer. This contributes to the understanding of how academic norms, particularly constructed by the ‘academic boys club’, seek to ensure that (hetero)normative knowledge remain undisrupted (Fisher and Kinsey, 2014). As discussed in sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2, the ‘masculine’ values stressed in the academy as ‘value-adding’ included traditional, positivistic and “inside the box” thinking (Fisher, 2007) that ‘disqualifies’ the knowledge of people conducting sexuality research. As such, it is not only business management academics that are not “charmed by queer” (Rumens, 2019:598), as the findings add to the academic literature explaining how queer theory is viewed as in tension with the overall aim of the neoliberal capitalism associated with UK Higher Education.   Additionally, another contextual factor inhibiting alternative sexualities and genders to form in the academy was work-life balance. Although the discourse of the ‘family’ is changing, participants in this study found normative ideas around the ‘nuclear family’ restricting their opportunities to bring sexuality to work. For example, as seen in Section 6.5.3, academics were assumed straight until the ‘other’ was made apparent, which means academic staff neglect to understand how different sexualities and genders form alternative family ties and relationships. The current study found that rather than conforming to the underlying assumptions of normative femininity and masculinity associated with ‘the family’, LGBTQIA academics deconstructed family roles and practices, for example by having several partners, creating a family through self-insemination or referring to oneself as ‘parent’ detached from gender expectations. These practices were seen as deconstructing gender and creating ontological crisis in gender, sexuality and language (Butler, 1999). The research also found heteronormative privilege was extended to ‘normative’ gay men and lesbians who were married, cisgender and family oriented (Garwood, 2016) thus seen as assimilating to straight culture. However, heteronormative privilege was not extended to academics who were in polygamous relationships. These contextual factors stress the importance of recognizing alternative family structures and genders while supporting and constituting queer research as creditable and valid research areas (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014; Luhmann, 1998).  198  9.6 “To advance and apply queer theory’s performativity theory to understand how non-binary sexualities (bisexual, pan, queer) ‘trouble’ gender and sexuality as stable categories” Amongst the 30 participants, 11 participants self-identified as bisexual in addition to queer or pansexual, discussed in Chapter Seven. Queer theory and performativity theory has been criticised for erasing the experiences of bisexual women by centring the gay ‘male’ subject as the universal to which performativity applies (Callis, 2009; Walters, 1996). Additionally, the scarcity of bisexuals’ working experience is particularly evident in the limited research focusing on sexuality in the academy, which has been concerned with the experiences of gay men (Skelton, 1998; Ozturk and Rumens, 2014) and lesbian women (Fotaki, 2013).  The current study, drawing on Willig’s (2008) Foucauldian discourse analysis, further contributes to bisexuality literature and found that academic discourses promoting cis- and heteronormativity allowed bisexuals to performatively ‘do’ gender in two ways:   1) As ‘invisible’ thus assumed “straight”  2) As ‘radical’ by deconstructing the hetero/homosexual binary taking up ‘pan’ or ‘queer’ identities  Although queer theory have been celebrated for dismantling masculinity from ‘men’ and femininity from ‘women’ (Stone and Shapiro, 2017), the current research contributes to the understanding that gender and sexuality, within the academic context, marshals academics to ‘do’ heterogender to be read and validated as ‘academics’ as seen in Section 7.2.3. As such, ‘doing’ gender within the discourse of academic invisibility, self-identified bisexual women could either ‘do’ butchness and be read as ‘lesbian’ or ‘do’ femininity and be assumed “straight”. Rather than becoming ‘visible’ as bisexuals and the performative practices read as ‘subversive’, these regulated gendered practices are seen as reifying hegemonic norms. Instead of being read as transgressive, the current research found that bisexuals’ implicit parody of the heterosexual coherence might be viewed as part of existing hegemonic power relations (Nentwich et al, 2015). Thus, in constructing a femme-bisexual identity, the current study found that hetero- and homonormativity forced bisexuals to perceive bisexuality as a questionable, non-legitimate and transitory identity on its way towards a stable “straight” or ‘gay’ identity.   As such, this study contributes to the theory of femme bisexual academics’ struggle of navigating academia as visibly ‘queer’, as academic institutions read feminine ‘female’ bodies as unmistakably “straight”. As discussed in Section 6.5.2, femininity was constructed as a contextual 199  factor contributing to inequality in the academy whereby femininity works to disqualify the professional body. Coinciding Fotaki’s (2011:47) argument that within the academic context, women cannot occupy ‘the neutral gender-less academic persona’ as ‘the body’ equates the ‘female sex’, this study found femme bisexual women were further alienated in the disembodied culture of the academy. The disapproval of femininity in the academic context was therefore found to oppress the bisexual body, as femme bisexuals’ rejection of the heterosexual label made them subjected to sexism as a consequence of conforming to heterosexual ideals of femininity while paradoxically resisting the subordination to men.   Whereas lesbianism is associated with the desexualisation of the female body, the current study found self-identified bisexual women entering into a heterosexual form of subordination by ‘being’ gendered (Butler, 1996; 1999). The discrimination faced by bisexual women in the current study further contributes to heterogender (Pringle, 2008), where bisexuals’ experiences with sexism cannot be explained by gender alone. The oppression of femme bisexual women is supported by Butler (2004:186) who argues that the “regulation of gender has always been part of the work of heterosexist normativity”. The current research thus adds to the understanding of how bisexual subjectivity is the outcome of “a process of social organization” whereby particular performative reiterations, such as self-identifying as feminine/woman/bisexual, becomes read as unintelligible sexual subject positions (Butler, 1999; Riach et al, 2016:2074). Challenging essentialism, the current research contributes to queer theory’s aim of understanding sexuality as open, multiple and fluid whereby sexualities in academic institutions are an effect of discourse rather than a biological essence (Foucault, 1979).   On the other hand, the current research also found self-identified bisexual academics’ ‘doing’ of gender could be subversive when identifying with ‘queer’ and ‘pansexual’ identities in addition to ‘bisexual’, which created an opposition to heteronormativity by operating from a system outside the hetero/homo binary (Lloyd, 1999). Whereas ‘queer’ has been argued to denote performative strategies signifying a ‘male’ body (Jeffreys, 1994), only self-identified female academics identified as ‘queer’ in the current study thus adding to performativity theory. For example, by identifying as ‘queer’, participants called into question the stability of ‘gender’ as following from ‘sex’ and ‘sexuality’, as discussed in Section 7.3.3. Participants were therefore seen as deconstructing the heterosexual matrix as a system of “maintaining gender within its binary frame” (Butler, 1999:140).  200   Additionally, as a consequence of experiencing sexism navigating academia as perceived femme and “straight” as seen in Section 7.2.3, Drew, Ash, Doris, Alex and Abby engaged in “radical subversion” rejecting heteronormative practices by seeking to trouble the sexual order (Stein and Plummer, 1994). It was therefore found that the visibility of the ‘female’ body, in particular ‘breasts’, caused gender trouble amongst self-identified bisexual/pan/queer identifying participants whereby identifying as ‘queer’ allowed them to question the normative. The practices involved in subverting heteronormative ideologies included identifying as polyamorous, challenging gender as deriving from biology, using pronouns such as they/them and constructing non-binary identities as the sexual object choice rather than men/women. Thus in presenting a gender that was not identifiable by the ‘norm’, the current study shows that queer performances were perceived as ‘troubling’ by transgressing the gender binary (Butler, 1999) adding to performativity theory on how self-identified bisexual, queer and pan academics challenge essentialist practices of what constitutes a woman.   9.7 Contributions and implications  The discussions above sought to address objectives set out first in Section 1.3. However, to provide a coherent conclusion, the key contributions will be outlined below.   9.7.1 Methodological contributions Firstly, using queer theory to ‘queer’ normative categorisations associated with sexuality and gender identities in the research process, the current research contributes towards queering methodology by demonstrating the benefits for organizational research to avoid a priori categories. By attending to how participants deploy categories such as ‘bisexual’, ‘lesbian’, ‘woman’ etc. and the implications taking up certain identities in the academic context, the current study argues for the importance of treating the heterosexual/homosexual categorisations as performative in order to expose the hidden meanings upheld by categories. Thus, rather than reproducing damaging binaries that restrict various genders and sexualities from becoming, treating categories as unstable and never fully owned, opens up possibilities for deconstructing previously closed categories. Rather than there being a ‘real’ category of investigation this research stresses the importance of understanding how sexual and gendered categories are discursive constructs that change over time as the institutions, such as academia, that constructs them change. Thus this research avoided categorising participants with a priori categories prior to the interview, as their identities and 201  meanings were explored and discussed during the interviews when participants were asked ‘how do you identify’ and ‘what do those identities mean to you’. The current research, by drawing on post-structuralist philosophy and queer theoretical framework, recognizes that gender and sexuality are situational and plural rather than rooted in biology, which allows for destabilisation of strict and normalised categories.  9.7.2 Theoretical contributions The current research contributes to the growing research on LGBTQIA academics’ experiences in education (Renn, 2010; Pinar, 1998; Ozturk and Rumens, 2014; Phipps and Young, 2015; Rumens, 2016a) and in particular Tierney’s (1997) idea of ‘academic outlaws’. By challenging embedded and taken-for-granted ‘notions of reality’, we become academic outlaws. Although Tierney (1997:31) hoped that “a generation from now… we will no longer be seen or think of ourselves as outlaws on the periphery”, this is unfortunately not the case. The current study highlights how academic processes of assimilation seeks to portray a picture of a liberal and ‘gay-friendly’ higher education sector that provides LGBTQIA academics with similar rights to “straight” academics. However, this strategy was found to reproduce existing structures of inequality rather than dismantling the system that continue to construct certain academics as the ‘norm’.  For example, the current study destabilises normative processes of knowledge production by illustrating how the academy silence queer voices by reproducing discourses that tend to serve the interests of the hegemony. Examples include citing the male canon to construct ‘valid’ curriculum, funding traditional research topics and rewarding academics seen as ‘research active’, which results in constructing straight, white men as ideal transmitters and producers of knowledge rendering women and LGBTQIA academics as culturally intelligible. Additionally, new managerialist practices, such as performance management, pressures academics to “follow the money”, which reproduces existing epistemologies. The academy was therefore found to no longer be a place for everybody, but a certain type of academic and student.   Tierney (1997) argued that by incorporating queer theory to the analysis of knowledge production, we can displace the academic structures that construct our current understandings of queerness.  Drawing on queer theory, in particular Butler’s performativity theory, the current study demonstrate how LGBTQIA academics’ lived experiences of ‘passing for straight’ makes visible the parodic enactments associated in constructing a falsely stable “straight” identity. However, 202  queer theory has been criticised for centring the gay ‘male’ subject as universal to which queer theory applies (Chevrette, 2013; Walters, 1996) erasing the experiences of lesbian and bisexual women. Additionally, bisexuals’ experiences have often been used to deconstruct queer theory rather than their experiences being incorporated as part of queer theory as less is known about how bisexuals negotiate sex/gender/sexuality. Thus, the current research adds to the understanding of how self-identified bisexual academics challenge the ontological status of a sexual thus gendered ‘self’ by exposing the acts constituting the illusion of a ‘gendered self’. For example, this research found femme bisexuals who resist the heterosexual label were subjected to sexism as a consequence of conforming to ‘normative’ femininities while paradoxically avoiding subordination to men. They were therefore found to lack performative opportunities to count as queer in the academy. On the other hand, when sexuality was not seen as following from perceived gender identity, gender discontinuities were revealed exposing the imitative parody of straightness in producing a stable gender. Drawing on the disruptive powers associated with queer theory, this research troubles the normative functioning and knowledge production of the academy illustrating how underlying norms get rebuilt by its current constituents rather than subverted, which prevents us from creating “an academy of queers” (Parker, 2002:162).  9.7.3 Implications for management The thesis further contributes to organizational and management research, in particular accounting for the paucity on the workplace experience of LGBTQIA educators (Tierney, 1997). The current research sought to address the importance of ‘queering’ the diversity associated with organizations, as the study demonstrates implications for practice when it comes to equality and diversity policies. For example, although many organizations, including the academy, is becoming increasingly ‘gay friendly’, the current study’s findings show how inclusivity is restricted to normality (marital status, family, monogamous relationship), whether that might be gay, lesbian or straight employees. Taking the example of ‘family friendly policies’, the current study demonstrates flaws in the implementation of such policies as they might not account for- or be applicable to all employees. Examples includes, but not restricted to, queer families having children through self-insemination or mothers not being the ‘birth mother’, trans* and non-binary employees looking to find networks and communities outside the workplace, friends that are constructed as family or polyamorous families. Thus rather than policies focusing on assimilation strategies of ‘sameness’, academic policies need to reflect the diversity that exists among and across sexualities and genders ensuring they do not restrict or foreclose certain academic lives and experiences.  203   For example, this study shows how academic structures of knowledge production silence queer voices by professionalizing knowledge through “departmental structures” (Tierney, 1997). The current research thus stress the importance of funding streams that allow for queer research and voices, which needs to transcend academic departments in order to create dialogue across professional disciplines. This is vital in order to challenge and reconceptualise what is meant by academic normativity. Additionally, the research highlights the importance of introducing queer theory to the curriculum, both in order to educate students on issues relating to sexuality and gender but also for academics to be able to bring their research and identities to lectures in order to ‘queer’ heteronormative knowledge hence making academia “queerer places to work” (Rumens, 2016a:3). Although there has been a positive shift in attitudes towards sexualities and gender identities, which have been influenced by anti-discrimination rules that have encapsulated the rights of LGBTQIA employees within the legislation, non-heterosexual identities and subjects are still criminalized in several counties. This provides significant implications for the internationalisation of the academy in which several academic institutions now have branch campuses in countries such as Dubai, where LGBTQIA people are not recognized and protected by law. The current study thus argue that it is not enough to change the structure of the higher education sector, however, the academy needs to be deconstructed and rebuilt to eliminate the cultural embedded problems ensuring normativity goes unchallenged. It is thus crucial to remove new managerialism and neoliberalism and move towards new, and queerer ways of valuing epistemologies, knowledge production and resulting metrics.  9.8 Limitations and way forward 9.8.1 Limitations The study might potentially be criticised by non-poststructuralists for creating non-generalizable findings that cannot be replicated to various contexts.  However, this study did not intend to design a research methodology that sought to generalize findings or experiences, as mainstream research on sexuality and gender identity tend to assume all lesbian, bisexual, trans*, queer and straight people are the ‘same’ by generalizing categories. The study, however, sought to reject epistemological absolutes and the ontological certainty of a ‘true’ and ‘core’ self by avoiding examining sexuality as a ‘real’ category that is universally applicable. The lack of possibility to generalize the findings is also restricted by the number of participants, which might question the validity of the findings. Additionally, although it might be argued that the current research 204  methodology and the current research findings restricts the possibility of pursuing an emancipatory agenda, the research does contribute with an understanding of how academic equality and diversity policies, often undermined by the current protected characteristics associated with the Equality Act (2010), do not go far enough. For example, by drawing on a Foucauldian discourse analysis, the current study deconstructs the grand narratives in the academy showing how they are both marginalizing and oppressive systems of power-knowledge restricting certain voices by categorizing people according to normative strands, which restricts fluidity.  Further, there might be limitations associated with the researchers’ suitability of engaging with queer theory due to the “matching argument” of a shared identity in the research process. Whether or not the researcher’s ‘read’ sexuality and gender identity had an impact on the extent to which the participants felt comfortable talking about their experiences in the academy is difficult to predict, discussions around the researcher’s sexuality were welcomed during the interviews. Being aware and reflexive about the concerns raised about ‘heterosexual’ researchers drawing on queer theory to study “minority” issues (Rumens et al, 2019), ‘queer’ research and ‘queer methodologies’ stress the importance of researchers to consider their research subjectivity and reject the ontological assumptions of a ‘true’ and ‘stable’ self throughout the course of the research (McDonald, 2013). As such, I followed McDonald’s (2013) theorisation of ‘queer reflexivity’ by not defining or limiting my identity to a category, but rather being reflexive about how the acts of disclosing or concealing aspects of my identity affect the research process. This discussion can be found in Section 5.7.1.  9.8.2 Areas for future research With the exception of one participant, 29 participants identified and were read as Caucasian. As such, the whiteness associated with queer theory is not challenged or disrupted (McDonald, 2015b). An important area for future research is an incorporation of Barnard’s (1999:200) theory of ‘queer race’ in order to understand how “sexuality is always racially marked” rather than regarding them as distinct axes of subjectivity, identity or power. Although this research adds to Rumens et al (2019:593) call for queer theory to include examinations of how heterosexuality can “be experienced as non-normative” by including self-identified heterosexuals’ work experience and construction of gender and sexuality, it is important to continue to ‘queer’ heterosexual masculinities as ‘normal’. Additionally, as noted by Rumens et al (2019), the current study illustrates the importance of queering academic normativity in order to expose and disrupt cis- and 205  heteronormativity in organizational contexts. Further research on LGBTQIA educators’ experiences is needed to inspire various management and organizational researchers to undertake queer theoretical research. An area for future research could be to examine how universities, and “straight” allies in particular, can advocate LGBTQIA rights and issues in ways that can contribute with problematizing heteronormativity within academia by bringing the stability of heterosexuality into question.   206  References  Abrams, L.

Meinich Jlm15@hw.ac.uk  Heriot-Watt University, EH14 4AS, Edinburgh Phone: 07944342703 Skype: Jennylouisem  Supervisor details:  Kate Sang (k.sang@hw.ac.uk)  Pierre de Gioia-Carabellese (P.de_Gioia-Carabellese@hw.ac.uk)   Thank you very much for considering participating in this research that aims to understand how academics navigate their working lives in universities where ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ are the implicit norm. This information sheet will outline the purpose of the study, the data generation methods and your ‘role’ as a participant and the ethical considerations (particularly concerning confidentiality and anonymity). Participation is voluntarily, and you have the possibility to withdraw from the study at any point (until the writing up of the thesis) without having to provide any explanation.   Research background: There is a paucity of research conducted on sexuality in academia, and specifically ‘lesbian’, ‘gay’, ‘bisexual’ and ‘trans*’ (LGBT) academics’ but also ‘heterosexuals’’ workplace experience in addition to sexualities and gender identities that are marginalized or not easily subsume under these ‘normative’ categories. This study seeks to learn more about your experience working in academia in order to ‘queer’ the normative assumptions underpinning academia.   Data generation method: This study invites you to participate in an interview either in person, by skype or telephone where we discuss your experience working in academia (either as a PhD student, lecturer, researcher etc.). The interviews will be anonymized and you will be invited to choose your own pseudonym name for the purpose of this study, which will be used in my PhD thesis that hopefully will result in publications and communicated to policy makers.  Confidentiality:  As mentioned, pseudonyms will be used to ensure anonymity. Additionally, any information that might identify you will be removed from the full transcripts (for example employer etc.). I will ask you at the beginning of the interview if you feel comfortable that I record the interview. The recordings and transcripts will be stored on a password protected disc drive and on a password-protected computer saved as the pseudonymous name. The only people that will have access to the collected data are my supervisors and the researcher.   Ethics: This research has received full ethical approval from Heriot-Watt University.   Any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me by email or phone. Looking forward to be hearing from you.  Kindest regards, Jenny Louise Meinich  248  Appendix 2: Informed consent  Queering the academy: academics’ negotiation of heteronormativity in UK higher education   I agree to participate in this study that aims to understand the role sexuality and gender identity plays in my workplace experience as an academic in UK higher education.   I have read the information sheet and understand my rights to withdraw from the study at any point (until the writing up of the thesis).  I agree that the interview might be audio-recorded and understand that Jenny Louise Meinich will ensure confidentiality and anonymity and that any information that can potentially identify me will be removed.  I have been given the opportunity to ask questions and understand that the information deriving from the interview will be used in potential publications.    ----------------------         ------------       ----------------------   --------------  Name participant   Date    Signature      Age        ----------------------      ---------------    ----------------------   Name researcher    Date           Signature                 249  Appendix 3: Interview schedule  Research objective Research question Interview question • To understand the role sexuality plays in academics’ working lives • To uncover the ways in which academics negotiate discourses of heteronormativity and how heteronormativity constructs sexualities deemed ‘normal’ • What discursive arrangements constrain and enable the development of LGBTQIA and heterosexual identities in academia?  • Academic background - Expectations going in to academia - Typical working day - LGBTQIA integration to the academy • Personal background - Self-identifications - Meaning of self-identifications • Workplace norms   • To investigate the contextual factors contributing to workplace (in)equality encountered by LGBTQIA and heterosexual academics in UK Higher Education. • What happens to LGBTQIA and heterosexual people whose sexual and gender performance violate normative genders and sexual discourses in academia? • Workplace culture • Research interests, autonomy, publishing, career prospects • Workplace interactions • Disclosure • Work-life balance  • To advance and apply queer theory’s performativity theory to understand how non-binary sexualities (bisexual, pan, queer) ‘trouble’ gender and sexuality as stable categories • How do bisexuals, and non-binary sexualities understand their subjects in relation to the hetero/homo binary?  • In what way does this binary enable and constrain gendered and sexual subjectivities to be performatively enacted? • Deconstructing sexuality as stable - How do you identify? - What does those identifications mean to you? - Have you always identified as such? • Norms associated with the identifications (gendered/sexual) • Navigating academia • Community belonging • Normative language  ",

    "abstract": "Whilst ‘queering’ theory has been accepted in higher education institutions, queering the \r\norganization is not, and more research is needed on lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, queer, intersex \r\nand asexual (LGBTQIA) and heterosexual academics’ experiences working in Higher Education \r\n(Rumens, 2016a). In this manner, research omits to examine how LGBTQIA academics are \r\nmarginalized and the ways in which sexuality and gender are inextricably “linked within a \r\ndominant heterosexual masculinity” in which academics are judged (Fisher, 2007:512). Research \r\ndrawing on queer theory is thus needed in order to expose the oppressive systems conditioned and \r\n(re)produced by ‘compulsory heterosexuality’, also termed heteronormativity, within academic\r\ninstitutions (Ozturk and Rumens, 2014). Although queer theory recognizes multiple and \r\nintersecting identities, it often tends to “reinforce simple dichotomies between heterosexuality and \r\neverything ‘queer’” (Gamson and Moon, 2004:52) hence neglects and subsumes differences in \r\nterms of marginalized sexualities (Angelides, 2006) and how non-normative sexualities can render \r\ngender as a ‘stable’ category unstable (Butler, 1999). \r\nGiven the lack of research ‘queering’ the academy, the aim of the study was to understand how \r\nacademics navigate working life in workplaces where discourses around ‘heterosexuality’ are the \r\nimplicit norm. Using snowball sampling to facilitate recruitment of participants, this study is based \r\non 30 qualitative semi-structured interviews with academics identifying across the sexuality and \r\ngender spectrum working in UK higher education. All of the transcribed interviews were analysed \r\nfor emerging discourses relating to LGBTQIA academics’ workplace experience and \r\nheteronormativity. Additionally, to explore how sexualities negotiate the heterosexual/homosexual \r\nbinary and the possibility to deconstruct essentialism, Willig’s (2013) Foucauldian discourse \r\nanalysis was utilised. \r\nRather than challenging normative ideals of gender and sexuality, the study found academia, as an \r\nheteronormative institution, (re)produces knowledge, practices and norms that marshals academics \r\n‘with a sexuality’ into a ‘queer friendly closet’ which restricts opportunities to ‘bring sexuality to \r\nwork’. This was found to present particular challenges for self-identified bisexual academics that \r\nfurther have to negotiate the heterosexual/homosexual dichotomy and its underpinning norms \r\nrendering non-binary sexualities ‘invisible’. From a queer theoretical perspective, this poses \r\nproblems for the opportunity to deconstruct essentialism and ‘queer’ the academy away from \r\nbinary and normative thinking",
