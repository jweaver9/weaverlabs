We strengthen connections across  communities to promote collective action. We provide resources and  support to create safe spaces for girls and women to develop as leaders, learn from one another, and take action to promote social justice.  Women & Girls CAN convenes the Community Accountability Planning Group which holds quarterly citywide conversations around ending violence against women and girls.  These are our guiding principles.  Women & Girls CAN 11 E. Adams, suite 902 Chicago, IL 60603 www.womenandgirlscan.org womenandgirlscan@gmail.com (312)341-9650 • We believe it is possible to end violence against women and girls. • We believe that there are multiple approaches to ending violence.   • We believe that approaches must be appropriate to the community devel-oping them, and should evolve from specific community experiences. • We believe it is important to recognize and draw upon people’s different experiences, knowledge and organizing approaches. • We believe in the power and knowledge of survivors and resisters of       violence. • We believe in having honest conversations about working in solidarity with one another. • We believe that communities have the potential and the responsibility to be more accountable to members of their community in ending violence against women and girls. • We believe that it is important to develop alternatives to the criminal legal system. • We believe that there is a connection between interpersonal and       structural violence, and that we need to struggle on all levels. • We are interested in struggling against all forms of oppression, inside and outside of our communities, organizations and movements.  Our goals are to unite people who share these beliefs to envision new possibilities for change, & to serve as a forum for the development of new projects that share these principles.

While the women’s anti-violence movement has made many inroads in the past 35-40 years, the groups and initiatives in this  report are rejuvenating the movement, and taking the work in exciting new directions.  The goals of this report are to highlight these inspiring initiatives, to encourage exchange and coalition between groups, and to generate more community           antiviolence projects.     Since 2003, dozens of individuals and  organizations across Chicago have  engaged in a dialogue around community accountability and community organizing as alternative models to approach interper-sonal and state violence against women.  These conversations aim to reconnect anti-violence efforts with communities, to  expand community engagement, organiz-ing, and accountability as methods of  ending violence against women, and to re-center social justice in anti-violence work.   The most recent conversations (2006-2007), convened by Women & Girls CAN and developed by the Community Account-ability Planning Group – the same group that oversaw this report – have showcased concrete examples of effective strategies; generated a discussion of housing alterna-COMMUNITIES ENGAGED IN RESISTING VIOLENCE tives to the state-funded shelter system; and explored ways to combine the best of service and organizing in our work.

We use the phrase “violence against women” with the recognition that many groups of women fall under this heading and that many are invisible and/or marginalized in the mainstream antiviolence movement.  Some of these groups are highlighted in this report—women of color, Latinas, Asian and Pacific Islander women, African Ameri-can women, transgender youth, transwomen, queer women, women in the sex trade, women with disabilities.  We also recognize that men – young and adult men – are often the subjects of interpersonal and state violence and can be allies in the movement to end violence. 2  As Alice Cottingham recalls, “It went from working to end violence against women to working to help battered women, it seemed overnight.  We slipped from one into the other, and didn’t necessarily     notice it happening.”    Mimi Kim, reflecting on the consequences of this shift, writes that the individual and confidential intervention approaches “limited the amount of energy and focus paid to community-based strategies” in-cluding “concrete actions or interventions unless a particular event, often tragic or lethal” got the public’s attention. As a re-sult, she says, “many communities of color remain ravaged by violence against women and children but fall outside of awareness campaigns and accessible, ap-propriate anti-violence resources.”  In ad-dition, the work to change the system was left up to policy advocates and legal ex-perts, rather than to the communities most impacted. (Mimi Kim, 2005, p. 8)  As a result, the antiviolence movement now manages individual incidents of vio-lence, rather than transforming the sys-tems that perpetuate violence.  The large mainstream organizations now function like other social ser-vice agencies and work with local and state governments.  Like the structures of other social service agencies, they are often disconnected from direct commu-nity engagement and more involved with the state through their reliance on federal and state funding. Over time the movement has lost its con-nection and commitment to broad-based social justice and social transformation.   activists who have been involved in the antiviolence movement for many years – Mary Scott-Boria and Alice Cottingham – to help ground the report in a history of Chicago-based work to address violence against women and girls.     Why do we need new              approaches?  Much has changed over the past 35 years with regard to the issue of violence against women.  There are now many local,  regional and national social service and advocacy organizations focused on sexual and domestic violence.   These organiza-tions, many formed in the 1970s and 80s, have created support, advocacy, and  resources for survivors of violence, and helped reform the criminal legal system to more adequately address interpersonal sexual and domestic violence.  One impor-tant result of these efforts is more public awareness about the realities of sexual and domestic violence.  Yet violence remains an omni-present fact of our day-to-day lives.  Many in the antiviolence community have been frus-trated and at a loss as to how to prevent and eventually end violence, and out of this frustration has come a critical re-thinking of the movement.  Many now recognize that the movement’s fo-cus has shifted over the years from its initial goal of ending violence and oppression to a primary focus on supporting and advocating for individ-ual survivors.    Critiques of the mainstream movement  center around 6 interrelated themes:  1. One size fits all 2. Over-reliance on the criminal legal system 3. Reliance on state funding 4. Narrowing the definition of violence 5. Focus on individual interventions 6.   Professionalization of the work 3  of color, immigrant women, incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women, women with drug and alcohol addictions, women with disabilities, and young women.     As Mary Scott-Boria says, “While the work has been good and important, it has never spoken to the needs of women of color.” For example, the mainstream anti-rape movement has not adequately addressed the intersectionality of rape and racism; as Lisa Calderón writes, “women of color’s experiences of violence are often ignored or unchampioned since, historically, rape of women of color was not seen as rape, but as a natural consequence of our ‘lascivious’ nature.  However violence against White women grabs the media at-tention, ignites legislative action, inspires protests by women’s rights advocates, and creates incentives for funding programs that continue to maintain the status quo.” (Calderón, 2004)   The needs of women with disabilities, who may experience unique forms of violence by caregivers, ranging from neglect to physical acts of violence, also are rarely taken into account.  Susan Nussbaum of Access Living comments, “How can we even begin to call a hotline or consider go-ing to a shelter when the person we’re de-pendent on for life is our abuser?”  In fact, Chicago only has one bed at one domestic violence shelter to serve all women in wheelchairs in the city who are facing abuse.  As Susan Nussbaum points out, “that woman is not able to bring a per-sonal assistant with her who she very well 2. LGBTQI is an overarching acronym that stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex indi-viduals and groups.  This acronym includes many different groups of people within and across the categories.  We do not mean to imply that this is one homogeneous community who would define and approach issues in the same way.  In fact, there are often tensions because the particular issues and struggles of those who identify as transgender, intersexed, and bisexual are often marginalized in mainstream groups.  It takes intentional ef-fort for the acronym to live up to its vision of inclusiveness. “While the work has been good and important, it has never spoken to the needs of women of color.”     —  Mary Scott-Boria This current reality was not reached with-out struggle and contestation.  Many in the movement — advocates, activists, counsel-ors, survivors, community members — and many from the most disempowered communities, have been the foremost  critics of the limits as well as dangers of the way the movement has developed, and many of these people are involved in the new work taking place in Chicago.    Limitations of the  mainstream movement  These new initiatives developed, in part, in response to what we see as key limits of the mainstream antiviolence movement:  Limitation 1: One size fits all  First, agencies tend to approach sexual and domestic violence with a one-size-fits-all model, with standardized definitions,  options, and strategies that don’t account for differences between and within groups and communities.  Too often, agencies fail to recognize the particular experiences and perspectives of women from marginalized communities – for example, poor women, LGBTQI2 com-munities, women in the sex trade, women The gender-based framework used by many agencies does not deeply consider the systemic inequalities of racism, clas-sism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism and xenophobia embedded in the social service and criminal legal systems.    4  may need and depend on.  And what about women who have children with dis-abilities, who need shelter?  They have no way of getting their kids sheltered as well.”  Historically, many mainstream antivio-lence agencies have excluded groups who do not fit the one-size-fits-all framework.  For instance, queer3 and trans women are often not welcome in shelters as “clients” or “workers” because of homophobia and transphobia; women involved in the sex trade are often not wel-come because their identities and work are criminalized; women with drug and  alcohol addictions are not welcome  because they are considered too risky; women who are homeless may not be wel-come in a shelter even if their homeless-ness has been caused by domestic violence.   Limitation 2: Over-reliance on the criminal legal system  Second, there has been an over-reliance on the criminal legal system for reporting,  intervention and accountability. This is the same system that often criminalizes and subjects communities of color, poor communities, LGBTQI communities, and immigrant communities to police surveil-lance, harassment and brutality.  In fact, the push for greater police involvement and harsher sentences has “fueled the    proliferation of prisons which now lock up more people per capita in the United States than any other country.” (Incite! 2006, p. 224) The mainstream movement also has not addressed the extraordinarily high rates of incarceration for women of color, lesbians, trans women, and immigrant women in prisons, who in turn are subject to sexual and racial harassment and as-sault by prison guards and officials.     The effort to develop strong relationships with the state for law enforcement and governmental funding has restricted the movement’s ability to critically challenge the criminal legal system’s oppressive structures and actions; thus, as Incite! says, “approaches toward eradicating   violence focus on working with the state rather than working against state           violence…” (Incite! 2006, p. 1-2)  Inhe Choi of Korean American Women in Need (KAN-WIN) points out that it is im-portant to contextualize the increased reli-ance on the state in the face of a national shift to criminalization as an answer to  social problems.  “The largest portion of the funding is through the criminal justice system for legal services and general oper-ating.  It’s understandable that the domes-tic violence community turns toward this source of money because it is reliable and pays for general operating expenses, which are very hard to raise money for.  What is problematic is that government funding is growing through the criminal justice system and not in community    education or women’s self esteem develop-3. While historically the term “queer” has been a derogatory term, many in LGBTQI communities are reclaiming it as a term of empowerment, and also a term that would include anyone who see themselves as outside of norma-tive sexual identities. “The challenge women of color face in combating personal and state  violence is to develop strategies for ending violence that do assure safety for survivors of sexual/domestic violence and do not strengthen our  oppressive criminal justice apparatus.”   — Incite! 2006, p. 1-2 5  education and nurturing people where they are.”  Because these mandates come from the govern-ment, they don’t  ultimately serve the  community interests in preventing and stopping violence.    Limitation 4: Exclusive focus on interpersonal violence  Fourth, as this relationship with the state grew, the mainstream movement  narrowed its focus to interpersonal vio-lence.  In the early days, the movement defined violence broadly, and included an analysis of state-sponsored violence,  including police violence and prison  violence. Over time, activists came to privilege interpersonal violence over  systemic forms of violence.  This was a natural outgrowth of a growing partner-ship with, and reliance on, the state, which made critiques of the state difficult.    As different state funding streams devel-oped for groups addressing specific forms of violence, even interpersonal violence was siloed along these lines.  Organiza-tions narrowed their focus to deal with only one form of violence, such as domes-tic violence or sexual assault, and stopped addressing the linkages between different forms of violence.  While this “siloing” was, as Alice Cottingham points out, “in many respects an attempt to try to manage catastrophic pain, to limit it to some kind of bearable proportions,” it moved groups farther and farther away from an analysis that linked violence to multiple forms of oppression and their perpetuation by state institutions.     ment.  We are seeing an increase in arrests, detainment and incarceration, especially with the growing anti-immigrant climate.  Our high schools are swarming with cops, youth are criminalized, and having more money funneling through that route is  going to make our work much more about feeding into the whole criminalizing    process.”  Limitation 3: Reliance on state funding  Third, the mainstream movement has    become more and more reliant on local, state, and federal funding for the mainte-nance of its programs. As a result, the state has come to define the priorities and   methods of the antiviolence movement.  As Mary Scott-Boria says, “when you get involved with the police, city and federal government, they have the power to      decide how the game is going to be played.”   Mary Scott-Boria tells a story of a frontline agency worker on Chicago’s south side who had lots of creative ideas on how to involve churches and other groups in the community, but “every time she tried to do something her hands got slapped.  The focus was on, ‘How many victims did you see this month?  How many crisis calls did you take?  How many hospital interven-tions did you do?’ Which is so important, but always at the expense of some real With the passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994, there was even more narrowing of what the       government would fund.  VAWA        prioritized law enforcement intervention and direct service counseling, with very little interest in prevention and  community engagement and transforma-tion.   6  Limitation 5: Exclusive focus on individual intervention  Fifth, over time, rape crisis and domestic violence agencies began to focus almost entirely on individual intervention (whether as counseling, support, or legal advocacy) aimed at solving immediate problems rather than on broad social transformation.  As Mary Scott-Boria points out, “The more we were successful, the more we were less successful, and the narrower the scope of the work became.  Now it’s a counseling strategy, a one on one go to court advocacy strategy, go into high schools and talk about rape crisis strategy.”  And so, she feels that rape has become more of a “therapeutic issue, as opposed to institutional and community change…It’s about how do I provide  counseling to a black woman as opposed to how do I get involved with the black community and understand what’s going on there?”  The systemic issues of home-lessness, poverty, economic injustice,      racism, heterosexism, transphobia, anti-immigrant policies, and police harassment are put on the backburner or simply not addressed. Limitation 6: Professionalization of antiviolence work   Finally, the professionalization of antivio-lence work, and the development of a    social service approach has meant that   organizations create a distinct division  between professionals and community members.  This has led to a helper – helped dynamic between experts and    clients.  Alice Cottingham describes this: “Once you got swept into the helper / helped dynamic, there were paradigms in place.  The helper is dispassionate, neutral, detached, and the helped are not entirely reasonable much of the time, aren’t really competent a lot of the time, don’t have anything to add to a conversation about what might they then want to do.  These were very traditional notions too many of us bought into.”     This plays out in the standardized rules used in many programs and shelters.     Alice Cottingham comments, “We had rhetoric that survivors are strong and   powerful, but we didn’t treat them that way.  We handed them a list of 68 rules to follow while they were there, and checked up on them.  We weren’t respectful in a lot of instances.  It would have been better to have an unstaffed shelter in some ways.  It turned into a processing plant of a certain kind, a program.”   Emi Koyama writes of her own efforts as a shelter worker to challenge abusive      policies – “I questioned everything; the ‘clean and sober’ policy regarding sub-stance use; the policy against allowing women to monitor their own medications; the use of threats and intimidations to  control survivors; the labeling of ordinary disagreements or legitimate complaints as ‘disrespectful communication’; the patron-izing ‘life skills’ and ‘parenting’ classes; the seemingly random enforcement of rules that somehow always push women Emi Koyama, a survivor and activist in the domestic violence movement, writes that we must “fundamentally change the dynamic of power and control within the shelter system.”   7  of color out of the shelter first.” (in Incite! 2006, p. 210)  Giving further voice to ongoing critiques  These critiques have been raised all along, particularly from women of color and LGBTQI activists.  From the start, activists and advocates from particular ethnic/racial and queer communities developed their own organizations to address the needs of their communities, and larger  organizations formed taskforces to address the experiences of marginalized groups.  Many of these initiatives, however, also trended towards adopting social service, criminal justice, and educational aware-ness models, as they began to accept state and federal funding.    Korean American Women In Need (KAN-WIN) is one example of a group that de-veloped its work grounded in a cultural context, and has since thoughtfully worked to navigate the developments of the mainstream movement.  Formed in 1989, KAN-WIN has always been led by the community rather than by outside pro-fessionals, and so tools and methods have been ones that make sense to the Korean immigrant community where the work is centered.  In addition, KAN-WIN was initially formed as a nonhier-archical collective, a struc-ture that raised concerns among the group’s initial funders.  But as founding member Inhe Choi recalls, “We challenged them.  We said that’s who we are, that’s how we work, this is our aim.  Doing the work was about building community,   including more people into our layers.”    While KAN-WIN eventually made a      collective decision to begin accepting   government funding, and then to adopt a traditional, hierarchical structure, dialogue and questioning have remained an essen-tial part of the group’s culture.   The       organization has opted out of applying for government grants that were too closely tied to criminalization, and has questioned policies that they see as harmful to women in immigrant communities, such as      automatic arrest.  They have also spoken out against the movement toward licens-ing domestic violence workers, arguing that it works against community building by   creating a tier system as well as yet another barrier for those who are not    proficient in the English language.     Why Now?   Now is a time of great innovation in the field, both in Chicago and nationally.  New and innovative efforts are being led  primarily by women of color, youth and LGBTQI communities.  The broad range of efforts in Chicago is very exciting because it is happening within a broader context of national efforts to re-ignite, rethink and re-mobilize communi-ties to resist violence and struggle for social justice.  Organizations like Incite! Women of Color Against Vio-lence, Generation Five-Ending Child Sexual Abuse in Five Generations, the Northwest Network of Bi, Trans, Lesbian and Gay Survi-vors of Abuse, Communities Against Rape and Abuse, Creative Interventions, and The Survi-vor Project have been providing leadership at a national level to reshape the face of the antiviolence     movement, and Chicago’s work is very much part of this change.     Websites of some innovative organizations: www.incite-national.org www.generationfive.org www.nwnetwork.org www.cara-seattle.org www.creative-interventions.org www.survivorproject.org 8  A number of key reports and writings (please see Suggested Readings at the back of this report) have reoriented the movement toward community engagement and      organizing and towards efforts to build community accountability for the  perpetuation of violence.   The current movement is exciting, also, for the variety of approaches being used.  As you read about the work taking place in Chicago, you will see many different analyses, structures and strategies at play.  The groups recognize that there is no one strategy to end violence; rather, we must use multiple approaches that arise from within communities rather than being imposed from the outside.  In fact, many of the groups do not reject the need for   services for violence survivors, or anti-violence laws, but rather reject the notion that these responses will, on their own, end violence.    National Incite! and Critical Resistance have a powerful vision linked to what we see as this momentum in Chicago; they write, “We seek to build movements that not only end violence, but that create a  society based on radical freedom, mutual accountability, and passionate reciprocity.  In this society, safety and security will not be premised on violence or the threat of violence; it will be based on a collective commitment to guaranteeing the survival and care of all peoples.” (Incite! 2006, p. 226)      In order to have the greatest impact and to successfully end violence, we will need everyone’s talents, resources, and contri-butions.  The groups in this paper realize this and are acting in ways that will make this real.  Youth-driven and youth-led groups are particularly adept at partner-ing: groups such as the Rogers Park Young Women’s Action Team, Females United for Action (which is itself a coalition), the Broadway Youth Center and the Young Women’s Empowerment Project regularly attend one another’s events, partner to hold joint public events, and lead work-shops for each other.    Groups are interested in building respect-ful and intentional relationships with each other, and reject the idea that they are in competition with one another.  This may reflect many of the groups’ reliance on grassroots fundraising rather than state funding.  It also reflects groups’ explicit commitment toward movement-building and their understanding of the need for collaboration towards this goal. This    commitment provides important opportu-nities to continue to build the movement in       Chicago.                      One of the most encouraging aspects of the work in Chicago is the willingness of groups to collaborate with each other.    9  homophobia, transphobia, classism, xeno-phobia, colonialism, among others.    Communities define violence  All of the organizations develop their defi-nitions, analyses, and approaches to      violence from within their groups and communities.  Rather than telling people what violence is, how it affects them, and what they need to do about it, these groups focus on generating the definitions and approaches from the experiences and perspectives of the members of the       community.  It’s important because, as AquaMoon points out, “having defini-tions imposed has been what’s always been done to women of color.”    The Young Women’s Empowerment Pro-ject (YWEP) encourages “girls to create their own analysis around violence and to create their own support system. We’re not     saying you can’t handle this violence, you need a shelter and crisis worker.  We’re saying violence happens all the time and we need to understand how best to       support ourselves through it.”    Jen Curley from FIRE adds, “We let the women and girls define violence for them-selves here. We don’t impose our defini-tions.  If she has felt that she has been put down in some way, we aren’t the ones to say: well no, that’s not violence.”   Latinas Organizing for Reproductive Equality defines control over women’s  reproductive choices a form of institutional violence.  Mariela Alburges says, “We   believe that reproductive rights are funda-mental human rights.  When there are laws dictating our reproductive rights options or controlling our decisions over our    HOW ANTI-VIOLENCE GROUPS DEVELOP THEIR APPROACH Broadening the definition of  violence   In the 1970s, many feminist antiviolence organizations used the phrase “violence against women” or “women abuse” to cover many different forms of violence and to make visible a continuum of violence against women and girls, including inti-mate partner abuse, sexual assault, rape, sexual harassment, street harassment,    police violence, femicide, war-time rape, and other forms of mistreatment and     violence.   Over time, the organizations tended to narrow their focus to one       particular form of violence, such as rape, child sexual abuse, domestic violence,  sexual harassment, among others.    The groups we interviewed all see them-selves as antiviolence, and yet the term “violence” or “violence against women” appears in hardly any of their names.  The groups emphasize the importance of     having more fluid definitions of violence and violence against women. While most of the groups we interviewed define their focus as women and girls, a good number focus on or include queer and transgender youth, and many include men from their communities in the work.   Most groups are less interested in specify-ing one form of violence or identifying one source of oppression and reject the idea that one is more important than another.  Instead, there’s an emphasis on the inter-connectedness of issues, including inter-personal and state violence, domestic  violence and gang violence, and reproduc-tive control as a form of violence.  Most groups focus on multiple oppressions, in-cluding sexism, racism, ableism, classism, 10  development of “community-based       responses to violence that do not rely on  the criminal justice system and which have mechanisms that ensure safety and        accountability for survivors of sexual and domestic violence.” (Incite! 2006, pp. 223-226)  Linking local and global violence  The GABRIELA Network Chicago works to make visible how the violence against women of colonialism, imperialism, and global terrorism is connected to sexual and domestic violence and other forms of inter-personal violence, including homophobia, within Filipina and progressive communi-ties. They encourage anti-war and anti-imperialist activists to address interper-sonal sexual violence, domestic violence, homophobia, and sexism, and they encour-age anti-rape and domestic violence       activists to include an analysis of global and imperialist forms of violence in their      efforts.    As Kay Barrett explains, “A lot of us are against U.S. occupation and a lot of us are against rape.” GABRIELA Network wants activists to consider the questions of “How are these issues connected? How do we break down these issues of global terror-ism?  How are rape and violence against women and LGBTQI folk connected to global terrorism?”    GABRIELA Network believes these are intricately connected: “Women are raped in occupied countries and that is an act of war, that is a tool of war perpetuated by colonization, or comfort women from Ko-rea, our bodies have always been colo-nized, or women who are being sterilized in Puerto Rico, the Philippines, various bodies, we consider that a form of personal violence and also institutional violence.”    It is not just definitions, but also  approaches.  Most mainstream service       providers encourage counseling, leaving the abuser, and/or reporting to police.  And yet, the youth connected with YWEP, which works with young women impacted by the sex trade, are often subject to police surveillance, harassment, and arrest, and thus do not see the police as a place to seek assistance, safety, or accountability.  For YWEP, a commitment to transformative justice means not relying on the legal or legislative system to create accountability for individual acts of violence.  Shira Has-san explains that for the girls and young women that YWEP works with, “more laws are not going to help.”    This has been a key issue behind the orga-nizing of Incite! Women of Color Against Violence.  The national Incite! in collabora-tion with Critical Resistance circulated a statement entitled, “Gender Violence and the Prison Industrial Complex” that was directed to anti-violence advocates who have “often uncritically called for tougher prison sentences and greater police        involvement” and to anti-prison activists who “have often not seriously considered issues of safety for survivors of domestic and sexual violence .”  It calls for the  “Transformative justice recognizes that we can transform our communities with-out the help of state systems, federal    systems, social services.  There is a way you can address violence without going to a shelter or without calling the cops.” — Shira Hassan, YWEP “People tend to put violence at different levels.  Rape is at the top, sexual harassment at the bottom.  But it’s all violence, no matter what kind of violence you’ve experienced.”       — FUFA member Yunuen Rodriguez 11  places in  Africa, we have to identify that these are patriarchal forms of violence as well.”  As groups look at global forms of violence, some also look internationally for models and approaches to respond to violence.  Casa Segura, whose members are primar-ily Latin American immigrants, bring first-hand knowledge of approaches from their countries to their work in Chicago.  As Ana Romero says, “Some of us worked with marginalized communities back in our countries, in places like Oaxaca,    Mexico, where there was not much     funding, no fancy infrastructure, not many licensed professionals, and yet a clear understanding that we ALL have certain inalienable human rights...and we had to fight for them.  Needless to say how much we have learned from these compañeras.”   Similarly, in Women & Girls CAN’s Febru-ary 2007 convening, looking at alternative approaches to providing housing for women impacted by violence, planning group members brought in examples of models from India and Bolivia to inform our discussion and work.  The project from Bolivia, Mujeres Creando, for instance, runs a house, la Virgen de los Deseos, which is open to women to stay for a few days if they need a place.  They also run a variety of economic, community, artistic, and po-litical spaces/projects (for more info, www.mujerescreando.org). Rethinking Survivors &  Perpetrators  Many of the groups do not identify them-selves as survivor-specific in their mission statements.  Because they aim to end    multiple kinds of violence from a variety of sources, they don’t emphasize a distinc-tion between “survivors” and “non-survivors.” The projects engage members of the community to recognize that      multiple forms of violence and systems of oppression exist and that members may be impacted differently.   Most groups choose not to use the term “survivor” because it is not one embraced by members of the community. For        instance, the Broadway Youth Center (BYC) is very flexible and fluid in their  approach to those who participate in their programs, and the definitions come through “community and relationship-building, and change over time.”  Thus, no one who seeks BYC’s services has to iden-tify as a “survivor.”  While the staff and youth leaders at BYC understand that most youth who come to the organization have experienced violence, these youth are not required to focus on the violence or to identify themselves as survivors in order to be a part of the project.  BYC provides a space for youth to address the issues and concerns they decide to address, rather than to have these imposed upon them.  BYC recognizes that they are sometimes working with perpetrators who have also Most groups assume that all members   of the community in some ways are         survivors of violence and oppression  and all can contribute to making the          community more accountable for       stopping its perpetuation.  12  been victimized.  As Lara Brooks says, “We’re accessible to those who are         impacted by and those who have perpetu-ated violence.  Some youth may be both survivors and perpetrators. . . . It’s impor-tant that staff and youth workers develop a complex analysis of anti-violence work, responses to trauma, and multiple          oppressions. It’s important for us to       remain diligent in challenging this analysis and the different ways violence exists within our communities. We do a lot of intentional work, especially with individu-als who perpetuate violence and how that relates to their experience of multi-tiered and intersecting forms of violence.”  This approach is quite different from many agencies that explicitly would not include both survivors and perpetrators of         violence as part of their work.  BYC’s      decision to not separate out “victims” from “perpetrators” at the outset is based on their recognition that there are multiple systems of oppression and privilege at work, and that people who are part of their community come from multiple   identities and experiences.  Lara Brooks relates this, then, to the issue of safety.  While some groups hope to create “safe” space by focusing on survivors and      excluding perpetrators, or by including only a particular group in the project, groups like BYC believe that safety is more a process and must be created through community building.  Safety is negotiated rather than assumed.    Lara Brooks provides this example: “We may build a relationship with a trans woman of color who is experiencing homelessness and accessing our daily drop-in program. During the course of our   relationship, she may develop an intimate relationship with a BYC participant who is impacted by multiple oppressions, dispro-portionate state violence, trauma, and  poverty. How can we utilize our long-standing relationships to support the     individual growth, resilience, and survival of these two individuals if intimate partner violence occurs? What does safety mean within the context of this relationship? And, more importantly, how do we create safe space that is informed by the needs of our youth, larger systemic issues, and    intersecting oppressions?  In our space, we have the opportunity to use our relation-ships with young people to discuss and explore—using a pace that the young    person defines—the intersection of        personal, community, and state violence. For us, this is healing work.”  Systems of oppression as root causes of violence  In setting out to end violence, it is impor-tant to begin with an analysis of why  violence is so prevalent in the lives of women and girls.   There is no one answer to this complex question.    Some groups see societal views of men and women as the central cause of violence.  The Rogers Park Young Women’s Action Team feels that the root cause of male   violence against women and girls is “the pervasive social belief system that posits male superiority over women as natural and preferred.”  Ending violence, then, will “require changes at the most funda-mental levels of society.  These changes must eliminate policies and practices per-petuated by the male-dominated culture that sexualize women as objects, demean their value, restrict their participation in As with defining violence, it is  community members who define the root causes of violence, and so the  analysis varies from group to group. 13  decision making, control their rights over their bodies, dehumanize them with labels, restrict their ability to use public space, and marginalize and demean their pres-ence.”  Another young women’s group, Females United for Action (FUFA), similarly       believes that societal views of women, youth, people of color and other marginal-ized groups are the root cause of violence.  FUFA believes that these views are shaped by the media.  Youth organizer Stacy    Erenberg comments, “It’s deeply embed-ded in our society through language and art that women are less than men, and should have no voice, and men should  assert their power over women.  You see it in music, in news programming, who the authority is vested in… So on a personal level when you have these societal dia-logues telling men and women that one gender is supposed to be subordinate, it’s accepted.  We think: that’s what happens, men beat women up, that’s the way it is.”  Other groups identify multiple oppres-sions as the root of violence.  Mariame Kaba of Chicago Incite! captures the com-plexity of the issue when she explains,  “We believe that at its roots, violence against women is based in and relies on the maintenance of oppressions, including but not limited to colonialism, racism,   sexism, heterosexism, fundamentalism, imperialism, ableism, and classism that cannot be separated because they work in concert to reinforce each other.  Hence, we are committed to ending violence by     confronting and dismantling all of these systems of oppression.”  The Young Women’s Empowerment Project also points to the maintenance of multiple    oppressions as the root cause of violence against girls, queer youth and women in the sex trade.  These forms of oppression “work together to reinforce each other and to maintain the hierarchy of power within these system of violence – from police to pimps, from parents to prosecutors – that affect our daily struggle to survive.”    For Susan Nussbaum at Access Living, it is the capitalist political system, the power of the state, that leads to violence.  “It's a system of government that commodifies human beings.  Humans are like raw     material under capitalism.  It breeds      violence on a grand scale, such as war, and on a very personal, individual scale,       between partners, parents and children, etc.”  Here are some questions your group can discuss to develop your analysis:    ♦ What do you think the term “violence against women”      includes?  Is this a phrase that represents your concerns or  issues?  If not, how do you    define your issues? ♦ What does it mean to be a “survivor” of violence?  A “resister” of violence?   ♦ What is the role of survivors in your group? ♦ Why do you think violence   happens?  What are the root causes? ♦ What forms of violence do  members of your group and/or constituency face?   ♦ What do you think is the role of the state in promoting or       responding to violence? ♦ How is violence against women connected to other systems of     oppression? 14  HOW ANTI-VIOLENCE GROUPS STRUCTURE THEIR PROJECTS  Questions of structure, including how   decisions are made and where to seek funding, reflect groups’ analyses around issues of violence and oppression.    Groups are asking the question that Alice Cottingham articulates:  “How can we think about beginning to deconstruct     hierarchies and funding structures and  organizational structures that exist?”    Being grounded in  communities  A starting point for many groups is their concern that many mainstream anti-violence groups are disconnected from the communities they serve, and that these organizations view survivors as clients and agency staff as experts.  Ana Romero explains that in founding Casa Segura, “women saw the need of building a project that was comprised primarily by          community residents, who had a natural knowledge of the neighborhood, spoke the language, could relate to the issues….their concern was that these social service  agencies were invading the community without ever including community    members in the conversation as to what type of structure their program should have.  They hated the fact they were       defined as clients, so they were open to develop something that was more        community based, and where the commu-nity would have active participation…and they would be called compañeras.”     Rather than copy the structures they have experienced in the mainstream  service community, groups have gone back to the drawing board to question every aspect of their structure.   The language used by other organizations also reflects this goal.  Members of Latinas Organizing for Reproductive Equality (LORE), according to Mariela Alburges, refer to one another “not as colleagues, but as hermanas, sisters.”    Typical of the groups we interviewed, the Young Women’s Empowerment Project (YWEP) does not view the young women in their group in only one dimension; they see them in their full humanity.  As Shira Hassan says, YWEP understands that “people have multiple lives; they are not just the drug user or prostitute, they are also a knitter, a mother, a nurturer, etc.  When we look at the whole person, we  recognize that they do have strategies to keep themselves safe, and they are already using some of them.”   An important part of this process of com-munity-building is the creation of systems of support for members of the group.    Alice Cottingham explains that in the early days of the movement, “it was so urgent to create safe space, women were dying…  Hearing stories of how terrified women were, how much they had been hurt, how close they were to being killed, nobody was prepared to listen to those stories.  We didn’t anticipate, what do you do with that information, how can you listen to it every day?”   Based on this experience, she urges activists to have a “sense of gentleness with each other.”    Many people we interviewed want to make this potentially draining work  sustainable, by creating systems of    support and self care, and by consciously rejecting the helper-helped dynamic.   15  Jen Curley continues, “We incorporate these conversations into our analysis – when we are working on the publication, in how we frame our issues. Important to this is an analysis of how we may          perpetuate what we are working to end; so we ask ourselves—do we use/support ways of thinking about violence that allow it to continue? Does how we frame the issue of violence in our    publication prop up systems of        violence? We feel that these are         important questions for us to ask.”   The group has prioritized the balancing of work and healing, both within and outside of their meetings.  Meetings do not focus solely on action steps, but include “healing rituals, sharing food, grounding exercises, telling our stories, what we have heard, seen, read about.”  The group has decided to hold separate monthly sister circles, to provide more space for healing and sup-port outside of the regular meetings.      Grappling with the  Non-Profit Industrial Complex  Groups have also made structural          decisions based on a critique of the “non-profit industrial complex” (NPIC), the   restrictive structures in which tax exempt nonprofit organizations operate.    Non-profit, or “501(c)3” organizations, are sanctioned by the state as official charities.  Such organizations must follow state   regulations -- they must have boards of directors to govern the group, meaning that they have inherently hierarchical structures; they must approve by-laws and policies to govern their organizations; and they must file annual reports with the state.   Many groups focus on self care and    building support and solidarity among group members.  LORE insists that the work take place on a personal level, with members of the group supporting one   another.  Mariela Alburges explains, “I can speak to another woman and check in at a personal level, as opposed to solely work work work.  So we ac-knowledge that we’re all human beings and we’re doing this on a volunteer  basis and we know that we can       support each other in different ways.”  FIRE stresses that the work they do “comes from our lives.”  Members use their experiences – “as healers, organizers, nurses, as women that work in salons, as mothers, artists, as survivors” as well as what they experience on a daily basis.  Jen Curley comments, “There is space to bring this - our experiences, what we read, hear, live - into our meetings. It’s not like this is the agenda and this is all we can talk about. We don’t box ourselves in in that way. For example, there were several young women of color who were assaulted on the south side and the news portrayed them as ‘unrelated.’ We had this long   conversation about how we are pushed to see acts of violence against women of color as ‘unrelated’ if not perpetrated by the same perpetrator, rather than as part of a system of violence.“           “What we’ve done is found a way to make people feel really safe and to        promote healing and action and support.”   — Jen Curley, FIRE 16  Most organizations obtain 501(c)3 status so that donations, including foundation grants, can be tax deductible.  Others, however, are choosing not to have this status because they argue that it is counter-productive to create social justice projects within a state-sanctioned system.  For these groups, reliance on foundation     support, like reliance on state funding, is risky because funders may have too much control over the organization’s goals and strategies.  While critiques of the NPIC are not new, there has been an increased focus on the subject both within Chicago and nationally over the past five to ten years.  Much of this focus has been spurred by women of color, and in particular, national Incite!.  They held a series of conversations begin-ning in 2002, and eventually published an anthology called The Revolution Will Not Be Funded (2006).  Chicago Incite! in part-nership with several local groups, held a two-day event in April 2007.  It featured a panel discussion with several of the book’s authors, as well as a workshop with Paula Rojas from New York’s Sista II Sista to   focus on implications for groups working with, and led by, young women. One group that has moved far away from a hierarchical model is Incite!  Both        national and Chicago Incite! have held  discussions to determine whether their structure should be centralized or decen-tralized.  Leadership on the national level decided against a top-down approach in which they would be setting priorities for groups around the country.  Taking this to The groups represented in this report have negotiated the NPIC in different ways.  Some choose not to adopt the non-profit status, and others choose to adopt it with some innovation.   the next level, Chicago Incite! has agreed that any woman of color who agrees with the national Principles of Unity can label her work as part of Incite! and hold events in the name of the organization.  Some other groups that have formed in the past five years also have decided to forego the process of becoming 501(c)3 organiza-tions, and instead have developed non-hierarchical structures.  For example, Mariela Alburges explains that at Latinas Organizing for Reproductive Equality (LORE), “we don’t like thinking of our-selves as a board, we think of ourselves as a steering committee where we give      ourselves the opportunity to facilitate these discussions, bring it back to the group, and think about next steps.  It’s a reciprocal, cyclical engagement.”   The Rogers Park Young Women’s Action Team (YWAT) is committed to remaining a fiscally-sponsored project because of the flexibility that it affords the group in set-ting up its decision-making structure.  YWAT director Daphnee Rene explains: “We don’t need to become a 501c(3) and then have to deal with the paperwork and the regulations.  We don’t need that to  accomplish our goals.  Plus, we try to   operate more like a collective and want to remain youth-led.  When you have to have a board, you have to open yourself up to adults having more power in the             organization.”  FIRE members had long discussions about whether to seek larger grants to support their work, but as Jen Curley explains, “we decided that we wanted to be able to make decisions about our work that made sense Some of the groups have decided to not seek out foundation support, or to limit it significantly.    17  for us – that were in line with our values, our mission, and what is happening in our lives – not on what a funder wants. We also wanted to spend our energy on the publication [a survivors’ storytelling     project that FIRE is creating] and with each other, not on having to go to funder events, keeping track of guidelines, fitting into rules that don’t make sense for our work.”   Mariela Alburges explains that LORE would ideally find “a funding source that doesn’t have any restrictions to our work and that just really allows us to tell our stories and the stories of the women that are working with us in a way that is       respectful to their experiences and that is enacting change.”  LORE has thus far   chosen to fundraise without turning to foundations, holding events and selling    T-shirts and buttons to bring in funding. Mariela Alburges sees this as a strength for the group.   “Financial factors have been a struggle, but also rewarding because we know that we are on very limited funds, and so we want to make any organizing event we put together something that is worthwhile for the community, something that propels our work, increases the mo-mentum, and takes us to the next step.”   Wondering how to raise money from sources beyond               foundations?  Here are some things that Chicago groups have done successfully!     ♦ Ask for volunteers for expenses like childcare and cooking for meetings ♦ Hold a “Cultural Night,” where you can sell jewelry and art ♦ Pass around a donation box at every one of your events ♦ Sell T-shirts and buttons ♦ Ask supporters to contribute, and then ask them again! At the same time, it can be challenging to operate outside of the 501(c)3 system and to develop alternative models.  Inhe Choi of Korean American Women in Need (KAN-WIN) reflects on the organization’s decision to move from a collective model to a more traditional one. “As the number of workers grew, board members were placed in the role of micromanaging the organization in personnel matters such as work hours, vacations and reimbursement, as well as disagreements over case man-agement…The absence of an executive  director also limited funding opportunities from certain funders that only support  organizations with an executive director at the helm.  Thus while we succeeded in  securing grants from important founda-tions and government agencies, we also knew that we could do significantly better if we presented ourselves as an organiza-tion with accountable and traditional  leadership.”  Groups that choose to operate completely outside of the 501(c)3 structure generally have small budgets, and are often un-staffed; this decision can also present challenges.  Some of the challenges Casa Segura encounters from operating primar-ily with a volunteer base are the lack of continuity and forced interruption of     certain initiatives due to leadership turn-over.  This turnover “speaks to the multi-ple barriers faced by the compañeras we collaborate with,” Ana Romero observes.  “Many of them are first generation         immigrants, low income, single moms…with no discretionary income and whose lives can change in an instant because of a job loss, a sick child, a personal ill-ness…..In fact, we are currently exploring alternative models of women’s economic development and sustainability focusing on social purpose businesses and coopera-tives….”     18  help people understand what we are doing so they see the successes.”  Groups define success in many different ways, including: developing and deepening their analysis and understanding of violence; developing youth leadership; the ability to push the social justice community at large to        develop a gender analysis; and the indi-vidual transformation they see taking place within their communities.    Conducting anti-violence work in a social service setting  Projects operating within larger social ser-vice agencies face a unique situation.     Social service agencies addressing violence against women are almost always depend-ent on state funding, and often have exten-sive reporting requirements on the         individual women served.  While all of the people we interviewed stressed how      important the work of these social service agencies is, operating a community-driven anti-violence project within such a struc-ture – in particular, one that seeks to     challenge the state – may present conflicts.     One activist spoke of an experience she had had at a project several years ago which was situated within a mainstream  For these groups, the decision has required them to rethink the role of the board of  directors, to create more levels of decision-making.  For example, Females United for Action (FUFA), which is a project of Women & Girls CAN (a 501(c)3 organiza-tion), has its own decision-making core group that guides the project’s work; youth representatives serve on the organ-izational board of directors as well, to    infuse a youth voice into all levels of      decision-making.     Organizer Stacy Erenberg feels that “an organization like FUFA that works to end violence against women shouldn’t put   hierarchical power structures in place that could lead to oppression within the        organization.”  FUFA is able to operate within a 501(c)3 structure, in her opinion, because “the board of Women & Girls CAN is dedicated to keeping FUFA grass-roots and making sure it’s youth-driven, and the adults confront their own adultism.  The board is really willing to learn…  and it’s not just the board driving something because of a grant they may get.”   As Shira Hassan of the Young Women’s Empowerment Project explains, “it’s been a long term struggle around how we      define success instead of how funders   define it. We need to build a language to Questions to ask yourself: ♦ What type of structures do you need to accomplish your work? ♦ How will you share power within your organization? ♦ How will you ensure account-ability for the work to get done? ♦ How do you define success? ♦ How will you fundraise to    support your project? ♦ What values will guide your choices? The organizations we interviewed were uniformly committed to having their  issues, strategies, structure and            definitions of success defined by their         communities rather than by outside forces such as foundations.    With these challenges in mind, other groups have chosen to become 501(c)3 organizations.   19  agency that provided services to domestic violence survivors.  “I started to imple-ment more of what I know, which is popu-lar education, and the group was growing and became very powerful, and at some point there was a question within the     organization, because there was a contra-diction between our philosophy and the mainstream organization… They were  trying to close [our project] but after a   letter writing campaign to the board with men and women from the community, they decided to give us another chance to continue.”   FIRE began as a project of Southwest Women Working Together (an organiza-tion that closed its doors recently), but left after several struggles in trying to operate within the larger organization.  Jen Curley, who was hired as an organizer, explains that the organization “was challenged by our circle structure and the dignity and respect with which we treated each other.  They were threatened by the ways in which women started speaking up about the abuse and violence they saw at the  organization.  It was then that they started trying to control all of us in       different ways. They threatened me with changing my position at the organization or trying to impose rules on our work (i.e. deciding what our meetings looked like, and what we should work on).  There were even implied threats of taking away some people’s housing or punishing them for ‘breaking program rules.’  And they       denied us access to funds we had raised.  It created a hostile environment for members to come into the office.” FIRE member Cernora Johnson adds, “The organization that was there to provide help and guidance to women who            experienced domestic violence became a place of tension, gossip, verbal attacks, and much more.  It’s like the organization that was put forth to help survivors of abuse became the abusers.  It had got so bad that I could no longer walk in the building because of all the evilness that was going on.”    FIRE’s decision to become independent brought clear benefits, but also challenges.  Jen Curley explains, “Being outside of a nonprofit organization has freed up both space and energy to focus on our work rather than defending ourselves and our work, but it has created new challenges.  My time as the paid organizer had been devoted to keeping the group going and helping to build the group -- through agenda building, follow-up, turn-out calls, documenting our work and growth, and seeking out resources and opportunities. Not having paid staff has helped us to   create a more collective model of working in terms of leadership and responsibilities, but it has been harder to meet or keep up momentum.”     At a recent Chicago dialogue convened by Women & Girls CAN, anti-violence        activists discussed the limits of operating within the mainstream anti-violence agen-cies, with some arguing that more projects, like the ones reflected in this report, need to be developed outside of this framework.  Such experiences have led some activists to develop an inside/outside approach, in which they hold paid positions at mainstream antiviolence agencies, while they are also involved in community-based projects aimed at ending violence against women outside of their work.   20  Others saw the value of continuing to try to shift mainstream organizations to      address some of the limits and renew their commitments to social justice (see also Building Movement Project report, “Social Service and Social Change” in Suggested Readings).  How to build safe  communities within the  anti-violence movement    Given the groups’ anti-violence and anti-oppression analysis, they are committed to creating internal accountability to ensure that mistreatment, harassment and         violence are not taking place within their own groups or within partner organiza-tions.  The groups adopt a variety of      approaches and structures to create safe, accountable spaces.  Creating safe spaces  Many of the groups recognize that their organizations and their communities are not homogeneous, and are not always  safe, welcoming, and respectful for all        members.  Some have begun to reflect on their own practices, reexamining how their structures and methods might alienate or exclude certain segments of the commu-nity.   The Brighton Park Neighborhood Council (BPNC) has made a conscious decision to create programming and structure that is welcoming to queer and questioning youth and allies.  In 2006, youth leaders within the organization formed a community-based Gay Straight Alliance.  Jessie Avilez, the first youth coordinator of the GSA, ex-plains, “Its creation originated from small group discussion with other fellow queer people, who identified the need for a safe space.  People do not realize that LGBTQ people exist within their    community, and this lack of visibility leaves the younger people at a higher risk for problematic situations.”    Through the organization’s youth council and GSA, he “found comfort to be myself and express my individuality outside of the home or high school – the oppressive system that was and probably still is ho-mophobic.”     BPNC followed up on the creation of the GSA by having trainings for staff and   leaders around homophobia and hetero-sexism, and by holding board discussions, so that leadership at every level has an  understanding of the issues facing queer youth in the community.   BPNC has also recently begun to have more conversations about gender identity and expression, as many of the youth in-volved have challenged rigid gender     expressions and have talked about the   policing they experience at school and in the community. As a group, however, they realize that they need to take more active and intentional steps in being trans-inclusive.  They see themselves as              in-process; as youth organizer Jen Curley says, “for us right now it means challeng-ing transphobia and gender policing within our group and work and acting to change it.”  The youth recently attended a Trans 101 training at the Broadway Youth Center to begin this work more structur-ally.  BPNC has also brought issues of LGBTQ rights into their coalitions as they address issues such as educational equity and criminal justice.    Several organizations spoke to the need to create a safe space for queer youth and women with disabilities. 21  Susan Nussbaum of Access Living stresses that “we are allies in the struggle, but it is really important for all of us to     understand all the various conditions that are on us because of our layers and layers of identities of oppression we’re dealing with, despite how we identify primarily.”  She urges organiza-tions to think through ways to create a safe space that is welcoming and accessible to women with disabilities.  This means    taking into account the wide range of dis-abilities that women may have, as well as taking simple steps such as obtaining and learning how to use TTY equipment.  As groups expand their definition of who is included in their community, and work to build partnerships with other groups to end violence, they have had to develop ways to deal with conflict and to negotiate different ideas and approaches. Sharon Powell of All Hail acknowledges that “when you’re collaborating, tension is    going to flare up.”  Looking to coops and collectives, All Hail is in the process of  developing and embedding conflict      resolution principles and practices into their group and organizational structure.   The Young Women’s Action Team has used “healing circles” to address internal group conflicts that will inevitably arise.  The circle process involves the use of a talking piece, a focus on active listening, and a commitment of basic respect for all group members.   Responding to an act of violence within the community  When conflict arises because of an act of physical violence within the group,        additional approaches come into play.      A starting point for some groups is to         explicitly state guiding principles for     everyone involved in the organization.  For example, Incite! members, including those in the Chicago chapter, agree to   Principles of Unity, affirming their       commitment to ending violence within and outside of the organization.    Chicago GABRIELA Network created a membership pledge card, in which all Principles of Unity:  We at INCITE!: • Maintain a space by and for women of color. • Center our political analysis and community action in the struggle for liberation. • Support sovereignty for indigenous people as central to the struggle for liberation. • Oppose all forms of violence which oppress women of color and our communities. • Recognize the state as the central organizer of violence which oppresses women of color and our communities. • Recognize these expressions of violence against women of color as including colonialism, police brutality, immigration policies, reproductive control, etc. • Link liberation struggles which oppose racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, ableism, ageism and all other forms of oppression. • Support coalition building between women of color. • Recognize and honor differences across cultures. • Encourage creative models of community organizing and action. • Promote shared leadership and decision-making. • Recognize and resist the power of co-optation of our movements. • Support these principles not only in our actions, but in the practices within our own organizations. • Support the creation of organizational processes which encourage these principles and which     effectively address oppressive individual and institutional practices within our own organizations. • Discourage any solicitation of federal or state funding for Incite activities. 22   Women of color have taken a leading role in this work.  Chicago activists partici-pated in a 2-day discussion held by        national Incite! in 2004, which resulted in a report entitled Gender Oppression – Abuse – Violence: Community Accountability within the People of Color Progressive Movement.  The report begins by stating that “patriarchy continues to oppress all of us within our progressive, radical, revolution-ary people of color organizations and movement. This system of oppression has held back our movement, divided us, forced us to make false choices among forms of oppression, and created environ-ments of fear and submission rather than justice and liberation.  Patriarchal attitudes and ways of doing our work, gender-based abuse within our own intimate relation-ships, among our own constituents and among comrades too often goes on silent and unchallenged. Denial, minimizing and victim-blaming which prop up and       support continued gender-based oppres-sion and violence remains deeply rooted within our consciousness, assumptions, attitudes, and actions or lack of action.”  The report clarifies the ways in which sur-members commit that they will not        participate in acts of violence against women.  The card is accompanied by a  series of trainings on violence against women, so that members fully understand their commitment.   Initiated by the      Chicago chapter, almost 1,000 women   nationally representing 12 American GABRIELA Network chapters, have now signed onto this groundbreaking cam-paign.  In other cases, issues of violence and mis-treatment may arise as groups partner with other organizations that may not share their analysis.   This has raised ques-tions that groups continue to struggle with.  GABRIELA Network Pledge Card  I, _________, pledge to challenge sexual and domestic violence in all its forms as a member of GABRIELA Network.  I understand that sexual and domestic violence are issues of power that impact the lives of all people in-cluding women, men, youth, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, queer, two-spirit, and gender nonconforming people.  I also under-stand that sexual and domestic violence     overwhelmingly affects women.  I pledge to stand by those who are survivors of sexual and domestic violence, meaning that I will believe their words, support them, and advocate for them.  I will honor their wishes, especially if they do not wish to report        incidents to the authorities.  I pledge that I will not perpetrate acts of sex-ual or domestic violence against others and I understand that if I do, I will be discharged from the organization immediately.  I have read the materials on sexual and       domestic violence provided to me, and have or will participate in the GABRIELA Network educational about sexual and domestic        violence. What does it mean for groups with an anti-violence lens to partner with organi-zations that do not share that analysis?    What should groups do when incidents of violence and oppression occur in  partner organizations?    How can we create accountability within our own community—within our own group, with our partner organizations, and with groups in coalition?     How can we develop responses that    engage the community, and that do not rely on the state? 23  vivors are silenced, blamed and mistreated within the social justice community.  It calls on people of color social justice groups to “set conditions for safety,       respect and gender equity,” suggesting action steps including: grounding the     organization in principles and practices that promote gender equity and challenge patriarchy; sending a clear message that serious action will be taken in response to oppression, abuse and violence; providing a transparent process for community     accountability; and providing structured political education to all organizational members and allies.  In 2006, Mango Tribe spurred a series of town hall discussions in response to “reports of rape and sexual misconduct by respected adult male members/leaders in the Asian American community in-volving female youths, 15-18 years old.”   In their “Call to Action,” Mango Tribe   emphasized that, “as mentors, educators, and organizers in our community, it is our duty to maintain safe spaces for youth. . . . And so, when young APIA women now feel unsafe in the very space where they first found validity for their political    identity, then we have failed them as a community.”    Kay Barrett, a member of Mango Tribe and GABRIELA Network, talks about how infuri-ated organizers had been to learn that the decision on how to deal with one of the perpetra-tors was made by an organization's Board of Directors and Executive Director that employed him, with no community input. The perpetrator was allowed to resign  quietly from the  organization, with no  accountability to the community.     Kay Barrett, who was one of the coordina-tors of the town hall events, felt that the feedback they received pointed to the problem itself.  She explains, “A lot of the other organizations, in my opinion as GABRIELA Network coordinator, are very homophobic and internalized sexist. The feedback was:  Well, she should seek law enforcement, there should be a police    report, we don’t really know who she is, but we know who the perpetrator is and he’s our friend, so why’s she anonymous? So, again, all of these mechanisms of      coercion, of isolation.”    In response, GABRIELA Network circu-lated an “open letter stating our stance  towards organizations we believe perpetu-ate sexual and domestic violence in the APIA community and in social justice communities in Chicago.”  The letter states that GABRIELA Network will not “affiliate, work with, or formally attend organizational functions that do not have a transparent process addressing sexual   assault. We believe that working with    organizations that do not recognize sexual assault would be counterproductive in making connections towards the liberation we envision.”     The writing of the open letter was a collec-tive decision made by all GABRIELA   Network Chicago Members with the      recognition that while it might limit their coalition work, it would deepen their   militancy and political praxis.  According The town hall meetings created a space to discuss how to create mechanisms of support when violence takes place within a social justice project, how to create a safe space to prevent violence from happening, and how to hold       perpetrators accountable within the  community.  24  to Kay Barrett, one important result of their stance has been that “a lot of those Filipina young women who were in those organizations are seeking to come to GABRIELA Network because they realize that we are a supportive, empowering space.”  Last year, a group of people connected with Women and Girls CAN formed a healing circle of trusted friends and        colleagues to support a member of our community who had been sexually as-saulted by someone in the social justice community.  The healing circle created a communal space for her to tell her story and for the group to talk about its impact on us.    The healing circle process was very power-ful.  The group recognized that it wasn’t just an individual problem, but a commu-nity problem, and that the community as a whole could take action on it.  As the     survivor says, “Until we were all in the room, I kept thinking it was just my     problem and I wasn’t sure what steps to take to make sure other people would be safe.  This circle was empowering for all of us, but especially for me, in large part be-cause we took action together.”  Through our healing circle, we came up with strate-gies to create accountability for the vio-lence.  We wrote a collective letter to the perpetrator and we alerted people who might be working with him about the inci-dent and the potential for future violence.                       Are you concerned about abuse and mistreatment within your own community or partner  organizations?   Here are some ideas:  ♦ Create a pledge card for your members, affirming their    commitment not to perpetrate violence ♦ Hold trainings for your          organization and partner groups to better understand   issues of violence ♦ Hold a town hall meeting so that your community can openly discuss solutions ♦ Set clear policies on what steps will be taken if someone in your organization commits an act of violence ♦ Form a healing circle to support the survivor and work together to take action to address the violence Healing circles and the actions of united community members can also be used effectively to respond to violence within the social justice community.  25  Strategy 1:  Engage people in your community!  Latinas Organizing for Reproductive Equality believes that it is crucial for women in the community to engage with one another and learn about each others’ experiences in order to build community and open conversations about traditionally taboo topics.  The organization has held a series of “cafecitos,” in which women come together to talk about their lives.  Mariela Alburges explains, “We present the conversations as cafecitos, so we imag-ine that women are just coming, sharing coffee, sharing with the break of bread, and creating this trust and rapport for them to be able to really speak openly about their own experiences and the ex-periences of their families. . . .”  This strat-egy of cre-ating a space and opening a dialogue with women is common to many or-ganizations. This method does not have to take place in only one setting and in only one way. Ana Romero explains that Casa Segura uses many methods to “push into public consciousness the kind of violence that women endure everyday, and which has been historically denied and trivial-ized.  We prioritize good old grassroots mobilization such as flyer distribution,   rallying, and street theater.”  In response to the murder of one of the women in the neighborhood they organized a march, There is a broad variety of work taking place in Chicago to end violence against women and girls.    This section will pre-sent six examples of successful strategies you might consider in your own work.  We want to make two points at the outset.  First, this report provides a snapshot of work taking place in Chicago.  Women & Girls CAN will continue to document this evolving work and share information about it.  Please visit our website at www.womenandgirlscan.org for more in-formation, and to submit your group’s in-formation, ideas, strategies, and successes.    Second, we want to stress that most groups do not fit neatly into just one of these categories, but rather borrow from a variety of approaches, and also shift their strategies and tactics over time.  Mariela Alburges echoes the sentiments of many groups when she says that Latinas          Organizing for Reproductive Equality is “not bound to one specific model.  Every time we go out we learn a little bit of something, and then we change our       approach, little by little.”  Activists are      rejecting these “false choices” of having to opt for only one approach.  Rather than pigeonhole the groups as working only within certain models, then, we offer these as successful approaches to consider in taking on this work.    STRATEGIES YOU CAN USE TO END VIOLENCE! 26  which started at the victim’s house.  Later, they surveyed the community outside churches and supermarkets, and organ-ized town hall meetings.  “We were       talking to many people – we wanted to know what the community thought about this murder as much as we wanted to    incite them around this issue.   The conver-sation was extremely rich.  We all learned so much in the process.”  Korean American Women in Need (KAN-WIN) uses community classes and work-shops as an opening for engagement around issues of violence.  The organiza-tion holds several different kinds of work-shops – from auto repair to parenting workshops to Qigong.  Inhe Choi stresses that this is about “meeting people where they are at and really working with them.  It’s the bigger notion of women’s empow-erment.”  Jenny Choi adds, “The Qigong classes are open to everybody.  It’s not just for the women we work with, it’s more for the public to bring them out and in that process we talk about the work we do and invite them into it....  They do these    meditative breathing exercises and it’s a social safe space to talk about         personal issues and network with the community.”    Young women at the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council developed a crea-tive way to engage their community.  They researched the impact of the Virgen de Guadalupe as a reli-gious and cultural icon on Latinas in the commu-nity, look-ing at a se-ries of im-ages of the Virgen, and at the mixed     messages that young women in particular receive as to how they are expected to   behave.  The result was a multimedia  presentation aimed at promoting dialogue.  The young women found that the Virgen was associated with positive characteris-tics like love and understanding, but that these sometimes were interpreted to mean dependence and submissiveness to men.    Itzia Favela, a member of the Girls’ Group,            explained in her presentation, “In all of these mixed messages we came across, with purity, respect and the Catholic church, it seemed that there were some common messages that related to blaming the victim.  For example, we are judged if we have sex before marriage or accused of  sinning if we are raped.  Sometimes the questions being asked aren’t the right ones.  Why aren’t they accusing him of  sinning? And why are they judging us?”  By sharing their research in a creative way throughout the community, they were able to promote community         dialogue around media justice and       violence against women.  Because the engagement takes place within the community, rather than in a client/provider relationship, it can be more    healing for survivors.  Heather Flett of Take Back the Halls contrasts community engagement strategies with traditional counseling for youth.  “I’ve been thinking about what’s really a more healing         experience for the young women – a    counseling session or a group where she is out being active and being a part of    something. I’m becoming more convinced that this traditional based counseling method is not what young women need.”     27  Community engagement can also surface issues and push groups’ analysis around violence in surprising ways.  Stacy        Erenberg recalls that when Females United for Action (FUFA) held a youth spoken word event around media justice in June, “we didn’t expect such an open dialogue about transgender issues.  But a bunch of folks from the Broadway Youth Center came and talked openly and candidly and it opened up FUFA’s idea that violence is not just binary female – male, but people who don’t define as one of those experi-ence violence too.  That was a big success for us.”  The queer and trans youth from BYC had an opportunity to share their   stories and experiences, and FUFA     members had an opportunity to see the connections with their own experiences, the sources of their oppression, and the possibilities for future collaborations.    Through these powerful approaches, women and girls in the community     identify issues and develop solutions,     instead of groups imposing a top-down approach.  Because this is such a central part of all of the groups’ analysis,          community engagement in some form has also served as a starting point for nearly all of the other strategies used by groups across Chicago.  Strategy 2: Organize!  Many groups are organizing, mobilizing members of their communities to take   action together to end violence against women.   There is no one way to organize, and groups are using a variety of            approaches.   The young women of Females United for Action (FUFA), who believe that media portrayals of women are a key factor in promoting violence against women, led a successful direct action campaign in 2006 against the Spanish-language radio station La Ley 107.9.  La Ley’s advertisement for a radio contest, which appeared on buses and trains, on billboards and in newspa-pers across Chicago, showed a row of  Latinas, photographed from behind in short shorts with “25 pegaditas” (slang for 25 hits or slaps) across their backs.    FUFA members felt that the ad promoted violence against women and demeaned the Latino community.  For FUFA member Yunuen Rodriguez, this was an important campaign to take on: “I don’t like my  community getting wrong messages about young Latina girls.  I don’t like the mes-sage they put out about men, and my little brother is a young man.  And I don’t want to have to be harassed… I wanted to tell them to take them down because it gets the wrong messages out there about Latina girls having to fulfill these stereotypes and Ways you can engage your  community: ♦ Hold cafecitos ♦ Pass out flyers ♦ Perform street theater ♦ Raise issues in community classes & workshops ♦ Present a research project ♦ Hold events in partnership with other groups Whether they take direct action to  address what they see as the root causes of violence, or infuse an anti-violence analysis into other social change efforts within their neighborhood, or engage in participatory action research, these groups are committed to dismantling systems that promote violence and to having those most impacted speak for themselves. 28  being looked at as nothing more than    objects.”    Through press work, direct action, an email blitz, and several meetings, FUFA was able to get a meet-ing with both the General Manager at La Ley, and a rep-resentative of Spanish Broadcasting  System (the Miami company that owns La Ley) to make sure that they would hear firsthand from young women about their concerns.  FUFA won not only immediate removal of the billboard, but also a change in La Ley’s ongoing advertising strategies.  La Ley agreed to take into account the young women’s concerns in their future advertising.   The Brighton Park Neighborhood Council (BPNC), which developed out of a tradi-tional organizing model, has, according to former Director Alex Poeter, “undergone a process of reevaluating traditional orga-nizing practices developed many years ago by white males, that traditionally don’t take into account identity, race, or the    cultural context of community.  That make a distinction between the public arena, where organizing takes place, and the   private sphere, where domestic violence takes place.  This distinction in traditional organizing means you don’t address      domestic violence, you can’t organize around it…. But we’ve been exploring ways to develop more of a community re-sponse.”  For BPNC, this means develop-ing new outreach methods, creating safe space for women and girls, raising vio-lence against women as a community issue at public events and candidate forums, and infusing an anti-violence analysis into their work around related issues such as affordable housing and economic justice.  Access Living is currently organizing  against the nursing home system, and   includes an anti-violence analysis as part of this work.  As Susan Nussbaum ex-plains, “there’s violence and neglect in these nursing homes.  Many people        describe things that are nothing short of murder, and next to imprisonment, or   torture, it’s the most incomprehensible cruelty that human beings are capable of inflicting on other human beings.  There’s caregiver abuse, and also this whole ware-housing, very paternalistic environment.”  The organization is fighting to have money for nursing homes go to individual people with disabilities to make their own choices “rather than straight into the nursing home’s profit margin.”  The group recently partnered with ADAPT, a direct action disability rights organization (www.adapt.org), in a 200-person protest at the American Medical Association.     The Rogers Park Young Women’s Action Team (YWAT) begins their campaigns through youth-led research.  Members frame the questions, design and use meth-ods to collect data, analyze the informa-tion, make recommendations and work with others to follow through. YWAT’s For groups that are grounded in          Chicago’s traditional school of            community organizing, these efforts have required some reformulating of  traditional organizing practices.  Some direct action groups — especially those working with youth — also utilize participatory action research in their work, so that young people can research their own issues and engage their      communities in action.    29  2003 study on street harassment included surveys of 168 young women and focus groups with over 30 other girls, revealing the depth of the “anger, fear, and anxiety” that youth were feeling about harassment.    The group’s initial action steps were to or-ganize a RESPECT Campaign that in-cluded working with local businesses to hang posters against street harassment and    obtaining support from public officials.  In 2006, YWAT launched an annual “Citywide Day of Action to End Street Harassment,” urging individuals and groups to take creative action on May 4 to make a collective statement against        violence.  The first Day of Action consisted of over 140 individual and collective “actions” across the city.  These ranged from individuals who wore orange in    support of the day, to public education events, street theater and a YWAT-led community march.     As community groups engage in organiz-ing strategies, and challenge systems that promote violence, they need to develop approaches to ensure the group’s safety.  YWAT members recall the reaction they received from some men in the community as they began to address street harass-ment.  These men labeled YWAT members as “man bashers,” and one day, an angry community member carved “rat ass hoes” into their front door, leading the group to have several discussions about community reactions and safety.  YWAT member Emilya Whitis comments, “It didn’t matter because we are still in this space and we are still doing the work that we are doing, and we are not ashamed of it.” Ronnett Lockett adds, “We’re creating a commu-nity, so we can support each other and see each other as role models, and that’s a really good positive thing.”    Strategy 3: Use art & story-telling!  Many forms of artistic expression have been central to social justice movements, including the anti-violence movement.  These include visual arts, media arts,     poetry, spoken word, and performance art, among others.  A number of the groups interviewed for this project have art as their mission or as one of their strategies. Like many of the groups, All Hail suggests that art has a special role in helping groups and communities to open up “different kinds of conversations, and a chance to open up the issues in a different way.”  In 2006, they held a weekend event entitled “Saving Ourselves, Saving our Sisters,” featuring panels, performances, work-shops and a photo exhibit to encourage community building and action to end  violence against women and girls.  A    central goal of this work is to create spaces for people to express and empower them-Strategies for organizing to  end violence: ♦ Hold the media accountable for       offensive images of women ♦ Rethink your own organizing model ♦ Raise issues of violence in   candidate forums and other community events ♦ Hold institutions accountable ♦ Do participatory action          research ♦ Hold a citywide Day of Action 30  generate strategies on ending violence in our communities.  The creation of video documentaries also can be a powerful tool, both for those who create the video and for those in the audiences.  Access Living has partnered with the group Beyondmedia Education (www.beyondmedia.org) to produce three videos showing the real life dreams and struggles of young women with disabili-ties.  All three videos have touched on the issue of violence, from the “brutality of paternalism” that the young women have experienced, to bullying, to control of women’s sexuality and the eugenics move-ment.  Susan Nussbaum explains that the most recent film’s discussion of domestic violence was particularly empowering for the Empowered Fe Fes, the young women’s group at Access Living.  “We talked about how it happens and what it looks like and how girls hopefully will  begin to internalize a sense of self-worth that will help them to avoid those situa-tions or ex-tract them-selves from them before they become too deadly.”  Mango Tribe uses art “as a tool to educate, as a tool to create dialogue, as a tool to heal ourselves, and as a tool to politically en-gage within women communities, queer communities, APIA communities of color, and honestly throughout the world.”     Using a theater of the oppressed frame-work, Mango Tribe engages people to   reflect on acts of violence and to develop a social justice analysis.    selves, to tell their stories, and to contrib-ute to awareness, action, and social change.  Art can serve as a powerful vehicle for sharing women’s and girls’ stories.   AquaMoon aims to “be a voice for disen-franchised youth and women, to be a voice until they’re able to speak out, through choreo-poems, art,  everything.  To be a tool to   encourage women and youth to be pro-active in telling their own stories, and let them know there are other women and youth with the same issues.”  While AquaMoon is best known for their powerful choreopoems, they stress that there is “not a corner we’ve left untapped.”  The group has created art   exhibits, education guides, and writings, and is now developing a full length play and screenplay.  Storytelling as a form of healing and    community building is a key strategy of FIRE.  They have experienced the power of storytelling through speaking at Take Back the Night events and conferences on  domestic violence.  As FIRE member  Angee Washington says, “Our stories made connections to others.  When we reach out to each other, we can build the connections and make the community stronger. “ They are currently in the  process of creating a publication with their stories and the stories of other survivors and people who seek to end violence, to “When we tell stories, others come forward.  And this is the biggest success.”  Angee Washington, FIRE   31  Kay Barrett explains that “performances talk honestly on rape, on how sexism,   racism and queer-phobia are connected, how some of us as refugees or immigrants have survived war.  It’s making our own personal narrative accessible to the larger public, and then engaging in a community dialogue after every performance.”  Sharing your personal narrative in a public space can be challenging.  Kay Barrett,   describing a performance piece called “Infestation,” which deals with rape, sex-ual assault and sexual harassment, com-ments, “Anytime we perform that, it’s so direct, just thinking about it makes me heavy and powerful at the same time… For us to push those pieces is a really groundbreaking and fantastic thing for us but also very challenging for us spiritually. It’s about, ‘wow, I just performed this six minute piece and I feel a little shaky, I’m getting body memory, I’m getting triggers.  So as performers, it can get pretty heavy.”  At the same time, she expresses just how powerful this work can be in engaging communities and challenging preconcep-tions. “It’s really great every time to see an audience when we perform a piece that’s threatening, like, I will grab your balls and rip them off, I will write survivors’ stories in blood and hold a mirror up to your face and lock you inside this room so that you can look at all the stories of blood. To say things outwardly, not as a threat, but as reciprocity: if this violence is happening to women and queer folks, it’s happen-ing to all of us.” Strategy 4: Use popular  education!  Many groups use popular education, a method of creating critical consciousness and strategies for change based in the    experiences and knowledge of the         participants, rather than educating them with information and perspectives devel-oped by people outside of the group.  Casa Segura uses a popular education and feminist socialist framework “to ground the political in the everyday life of their participants.”  They describe their popular education work as helping “participants increase their ability to talk about and   critically analyze their personal and       collective issues in all its dimensions – that is, in relation to local realities and broader social inequalities (e.g. political work is not outside of your struggle for subsistence, is not in an office, but in your life).”  This work sometimes takes place in the streets in the form of street theater.   The Young Women’s Empowerment     Project (YWEP) leads popular education workshops in Chicago and nationwide for youth on the sex trade.  As Shira Hassan ex-plains, they lead these workshops in detention centers, group homes, shelters, drop in cen-ters, “or any place that girls ask us to come.”  They estimate that they will reach over 700 girls through 40 workshops in 2007 alone.    YWEP also holds weekly membership meetings called “Girls in Charge” that use a popular education curriculum centered around words related to social justice.  For example, when the young women looked at the word “power,” they pooled their Ideas for using arts & storytelling: ♦ Create spaces for people to tell their stories ♦ Create a photo exhibit ♦ Hold a spoken word or            performance event ♦ Create a video documentary 32  When we give them extra information, we let them struggle with the ideas as          opposed to us telling them what they should think about it.”  The All Hail Project also stresses the      importance of popular education when working with youth.   Sharon Powell      rejects “propaganda education, which says ‘this is bad,’ ‘that’s a bad idea to have’, without really listening to what youth are telling us about their experiences.”  The organization’s work “challenges that boundary of telling folks what to do as   opposed to letting them discover some-thing that’s workable for them and their experience and situation.”    As an example, she describes a situation in which workshop participants, responding to the question of what causes violence, answered “a nagging woman.” Rather than telling the youth that they were wrong, she had the group talk more about what it means to say that a “nagging woman” provokes violence.  For her, it is important to explore young people’s ideas and responses rather than telling them that they are wrong.  She believes it is impor-tant to listen because they might be telling us something very important that might help us deal with the situation in a differ-ent way.   collective knowledge about the meaning of the word, and then YWEP leaders added new information to support their analysis, exploring the differences between institu-tional and personal power.  The young women then created an art project about power, making flags representing how they reclaim power and sewing them      together to create a “giant flag of our     collective power.”  Finally, after seeing YWEP leaders speaking at a panel          discussion on Reproductive Justice, the youth debriefed about the power of voice.     YWEP also uses popular education to work through issues that arise among staff and within the community.  Shira Hassan explains, “Whenever we have an issue to work through—such as Safety/Violence Prevention—we come together and use popular education tools. Because we are a consensus-based project we generally in-corporate the idea of mining our collective resources to come up with something that tells a story we can all see ourselves in.  For instance, when our space was being targeted, we met together as a community and focused on our resilience and the ways we already protect ourselves. We also talked about the areas we wanted to know and do more about —like self-defense.  We then broke up into committees to take   action.”  Heather Flett explains what popular     education looks like at Take Back the Halls, which leads anti-violence work-shops in high schools. “We don’t use     traditional education.  The information comes from the life experience of the     students and what they already know.  Popular education methods are of       particular interest to groups working with young people, since youth are so often told by adults what they should think and believe.   POPULAR EDUCATION PRINCIPLES   1. Reflection—start with the experi-ence of the people in the room 2. Look for patterns 3. Add new theory & information 4. Practice skills, strategize & plan for action 5. Take action  Young Women’s Empowerment Project 33  the small and slow changes people make in their lives.”   Similarly, Lara Brooks at Broadway Youth Center (BYC) insists on “meeting people where they are, without requirements like other programs have.  For example, we know that youth who are homeless and living with violence may use various cop-ing strategies, including using sub-stances.  We make services available to them even if they’re under the influence, as long as their use does not compromise the safety of the space.  Young people are welcome to come, hang out, and access services.”    BYC emphasizes the importance of offer-ing “young people a fluidity of engage-ment,” making it easier for the youth to stay connected.  “In our daily drop-in     program, you don’t have to talk to a case manager to get food or take a shower. You don’t have to disclose your life story to meet some of your basic human needs.”  As a result, Lara Brooks says, “Some youth come for food only, and want quiet time, or to share space with others. Others are in 8 programs and have leadership in four programs and are here 8 hours a day. It’s significant to give young people that flexibility and choice.”  The focus of harm reduction is on      keeping people as safe as they can be and encouraging them to take whatever steps they can to make this possible.  YWEP does not mandate abstinence or complete adherence to one policy.  They not only meet the young women and girls where they are, but they see the girls, wherever they are, as potential leaders of the project.  Shira Hassan says, “No matter what, girls are  capable, they are prepared to be lead-ers.  If they are currently in the sex trade, Strategy 5: Use harm        reduction!  Some in the mainstream anti-violence movement have worked under the often unexpressed assumption that there is one “right answer” in responding to violence – for instance, the suggestion of “leaving” as the best solution to domestic violence.  Many traditional service agencies have fallen into the trap of encouraging an     either/or approach to the complex         dynamics involved in domestic violence, addiction, prostitution/sex trade.  At some of these agencies, an individual must    commit to total change to receive resources and services.  Women who “go back” to their abusers are tacitly judged as weak and “bad”; women who use drugs and/or are involved in the sex trade are judged and unwelcome.    Some groups around the country, and in Chicago, have responded to this by devel-oping projects using a harm reduction   approach.  The Young Women’s Empow-erment Project (YWEP), which works with young women impacted by the sex trade, is based in a harm reduction philosophy. Shira Hassan explains, “We don’t ask that girls promise to stop  using drugs, being sexually active or trading sex for money or survival needs to   participate in our pro-ject. We support youth who are seeking to exit too, but often exiting the sex trade is a long process. We encourage and celebrate “Harm reduction is “a practice of          respectful, free of judgment engagement with people to find ways to be healthier, safer, and more in control of their lives without having to make sudden and     immediate changes. “ — Shira Hassan, YWEP 34  Strategy 6: Partner with Men  A common strategy among the groups is to partner with men, and in particular young men, in their work.  For many groups, this developed as a natural pro-gression of their analysis, and a belief that men have a large role to play in ending violence against women.  Veronica Pre-cious Bohanan of AquaMoon explains “We were never ex-clusionary.  I feel you can’t deal with women without deal-ing with men; I feel men and women balance each other out.  AquaMoon was first focusing on what is a female perspective on this.  That perspec-tive more often than not does include men, albeit in a positive or negative way.  Our goal with the second choreopoem (Aqua Beats and Moon Verses, Vol. II) was to bring in and better incorporate the male voice.”    Lillian Matanmi, Associate Director of the Rogers Park Young Women’s Action Team (YWAT), feels that “violence against women and girls isn't our issue but a man's issue. Because if they don't realize that it is the responsibility of the perpetra-tor to stop the oppression, the violence will never end.  The fact is, men will listen to other men before they listen to us.  People often commend us for the work that we do against gender violence, but I personally am embarrassed by the minimal amount of men that help fight women's oppression.”   Alex Poeter of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council agrees, suggesting that it “takes a specific approach to get currently using drugs, they can still pro-vide leadership in our project.”    Harm reduction can be a challenging     approach, because it can be isolating in a social justice community that does not readily accept its values.  Shira Hassan  recalls that in YWEP’s early days, “we were really isolated, and in some ways it was intentional and in other ways it hap-pens when you own your experience as a drug user or as someone involved in the sex trade.  We’re saying this is who we are and that creates a lot of isolation and that creates a lot of burnout. We have to think, now, how do we sustain ourselves when we have so few people that we can really rely on that understand and don’t judge around the sex trade? And on an institu-tional level it’s hard but the lesson was that we had to start with individuals as allies.”  YWEP has found that in partner-ing with individual staff at social justice groups across Chicago, they can build at least temporary alliances to support the work.  “Other than being a moral obligation to end violence everywhere, males need to acknowledge the violence against women and educate themselves about it, so that they can educate and influence other men.”  — Lillian Matanmi, YWAT HARM REDUCTION PRACTICE  VALUES  ♦ Meet people where they are at ♦ Don’t condemn or judge! ♦ Everyone can be a leader ♦ Encourage and celebrate the small changes people make in their lives ♦ Everybody is an expert in their own lives ♦ Change is a process; every step matters 35  taken into consideration.  We also have difficulty finding adult men with expertise in the field to facilitate the young men's program.”  This latter challenge in         particular has led groups to develop their own approaches.  Take Back the Halls has made work with young men an im-portant part of their pre-vention ef-forts.  Young men partici-pate and take active roles in each of the three high schools they work in, either in co-ed groups or boys-only groups.  Last year, for example, one groups of boys created an educational video about sexual violence that was directed toward other young men their age.  Heather Flett explains the power of involving them in this work, “The young men are seen as allies in the movement.  We also help them to recog-nize the negative impact violence against women and children has had on their own lives.  Many of the boys are child witnesses of domestic violence and some are child sexual abuse survivors.”  FUFA – a group that is only open to women and girls – developed a partner-ship with young men in summer 2006, holding dialogues around media and    gender, and launching a photo documen-tation project.  FUFA distributed dispos-able cameras to young men and women, asking them to document positive images of men and women that they do not see portrayed in mainstream media.  The    resulting images were turned into a      traveling photo exhibit, with an               men to understand the issue and the need to support it, looking at systemic struc-tures that perpetuate sexism.  Women are still seen as lower beings with a lower status within society.  We need to pursue and embrace equality, including gender.  People have internalized sexist behavior and aren’t even aware.  Also, men are in power, and it requires for us to          understand that it’s important for the benefit of the community to give up that power.  It requires a process to unlearn bad behavior, to develop a new analysis on the issue, to see how this issue relates to the broader context of the  community.”  Heather Flett of Take Back the Halls      considers this work especially important in tackling the issue of teen dating violence.  “Prevention efforts often focus only on working with young women.  I believe that this sends an underlying victim     blaming message.  If we truly believe that it is men's behavior that is inappropriate and needs to change, then we should be targeting young men.  But men and boys have historically not been considered allies in the movement to end violence against women.  They have, in fact, often been   unwelcome and seen as perpetrators and supporters of violence.”  This work can raise several questions.  First, for groups that are female-led, there is the question of points of entry for men.  As Stacy Erenberg of Females United for Action (FUFA) asks, “How do we include men in a women or girl-led organization?  Do we keep it a safe space for women?  Do we open up our group to both genders?”  In addition, as Heather Flett adds, “It can be a challenge to engage young men and keep them interested in the process.  They learn and interact differently than young women, and these differences must be 36  Lillian Matanmi is hopeful about men moving forward with this work.  “YWAT is just taking a preliminary step by educating and recruiting men,” she says, “but it's up to the men to really get the ball rolling.”                          accompanying reading packet and          discussion guide, that has already been viewed by hundreds of youth in communi-ties across Chicago.  FUFA member Yunuen Rodriguez felt that this was a powerful partnership: “The guys were really enthusiastic about being male allies and actually saying ‘no, I don’t like seeing women being objectified, because I don’t like it when my girlfriend or mom gets harassed.  So they had a chance to show their life in a way that counters the media’s views on how men live their lives.”    YWAT has struggled with the questions of how to partner with young men since 2004.  After an initial project called She Say/He Say, they launched a multi-tiered partnership with young men, through their campaign, “Engaging Young Men as Allies to End Violence Against Women & Girls,” in summer 2006.  A key goal of YWAT’s work has been to identify young men’s attitudes about violence against women and girls.    The young women partnered with         Beyondmedia Education to produce a documentary called Real Talk: Engaging Young Men as Allies to End Violence against Women and Girls.  They have surveyed over 200 young men to document their   attitudes in a report and have co-facilitated workshops with young men over the past couple of years.  Most recently, YWAT held a \"train the trainer\" event for young men to learn how to develop their own workshops and events focusing on gender violence.  The young men will have an   opportunity to apply for a small grant to launch their own projects, and the group will hold a conference in February 2008, “Talking About Misogyny,” to continue this important work.    Ideas for partnering with men:  ♦ Have a discussion with young men and women about violence ♦ Build a partnership with a group of young men as allies ♦ Engage in a concrete project  together to promote dialogue ♦ Find out what young men think about violence ♦ Provide trainings for young men about gender violence ♦ Challenge men to step up to the plate 37  Don’t forget that it’s not necessary to form a 501(c)3 organization, or get a big grant, to make change.

    "abstract": "\"Communities Engaged in Resisting Violence\" documents a new movement in Chicago that seeks to end violence against women through community engagement and accountability, rather than solely social services and criminal justice. This report documents the innovative approaches, structures and strategies of sixteen community-based initiatives from across Chicago that are changing the way that we deal with violence against women in this society.Why do we need new approaches? The women's movement against violence has accomplished much over the past 35 years. There are now many local, regional and national organizations that provide support, advocacy, and educational resources. And yet, violence remains an omni-present fact of our day-to-day lives.
