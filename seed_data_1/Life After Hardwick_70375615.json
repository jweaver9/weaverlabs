Hunter*Unless or until it is narrowed or overruled, Bowers v.Hardwick' will dominate the law concerning government regula-tion of sexuality. In Hardwick the Supreme Court upheld as con-stitutional a Georgia sodomy statute that made oral or anal inter-course a felony punishable by up to twenty years in prison.2 TheCourt ended its long reluctance to assess the constitutionality oflimitations on sexuality as distinct from contraception3 by rulingthat the protected zone created by the privacy right stops short ofcovering private consensual sexual relations between adults. In soruling, the Court left in place a patchwork of prohibitory laws inwhich identical acts are immunized or criminalized as one tra-verses state borders.4Although Hardwick was litigated as a sexual privacy case,and despite the fact that the Georgia statute drew no distinctionsbased on sexual orientation, the case has been interpreted primar-ily as a ruling on homosexuality. The Court explicitly limited itsholding to the legitimacy of laws criminalizing sexual acts betweenpersons of the same sex, refusing to indicate whether the samestandard of deference to legislative determinations of moralitywould apply if pairs of the opposite sex engaged in the prohibitedbehavior.5 Since Hardwick was decided, the threshold question in* Associate Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School, and founder and former Director,American Civil Liberties Union Lesbian and Gay Rights Project and AIDS Project.

The courts must still decide whetherthe decision in Hardwick was a ruling on conduct or a ruling on aclass of people.The result is an extraordinary new judicial discourse aboutthe social meaning of homosexuality and the determinants of sex-ual behavior and sexual identity. It is driven by the needs both ofthose who seek repressive measures and of those who seek group-based civil rights. Both interests require a reliable definitionalstructure on which to ground their arguments and a coherent sys-tem for identifying homosexuality. Both camps accept the idea ofsexual identity as a central aspect of the human condition, butsharply dispute the definition, expression and regulation of suchidentity. Implicit in each adjudication is the threat of reinforcingor increasing the social penalty accruing to disfavored sexualities,yet at the same time the very debate itself creates opportunitiesto contest hegemonic categories.The context for the post-Hardwick debate is deeply paradox-ical. The law is dominated by the emergence of the RehnquistCourt, well advanced in what has become a liberty demolitionproject. At the same time, the investigation of homosexuality hasblossomed in scientific and academic circles. 6 Popular movementsseeking greater political and social freedom for lesbians and gaymen have also mushroomed. 7 These factors ensure that the issuesraised in the post-Hardwick litigation are not transitory.This Article argues that the term sodomy is a cultural cha-meleon, which has shifted in meaning from its original delineations6 See, e.g., JOHN D'EMILIO & ESTELLE B.

Despite itsideals of constancy and clarity, the law has collaborated in thatshift, as the Supreme Court did, sub silentio, in Hardwick, and asthe majority of the federal judiciary continues to do. This phenom-enon is now confusing Equal Protection doctrine, and it necessi-tates a gay-friendly deconstruction of the new sexual orientationcategories.I. The \"Utterly Confused Category\" 8The core of the debate over the ramifications of Hardwickgrows out of the disjuncture between the legal definition of sodomyand its social and cultural meanings. The crime of sodomy origi-nated in ecclesiastical regulation of a range of nonmarital, nonpro-creative sexual practices. Nonprocreation was the central offenseand the core of the crime. 9 Homosexual conduct fell within thecluster of activities that were regulated, but most early Americanstatutes defined sodomy in terms of anal intercourse, whetherbetween men or between a man and a woman.10 The \"crime againstnature\" to which that phrase refers was not, as is often assumedtoday, a crime against heterosexuality, but a crime againstprocreation.Confusion as to the meaning of sodomy is not new. It wasevident in perhaps the first debate in American law over the scopeof its definition: in the winter of 1641-1642, a sodomy case arosein the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Three men were discovered tohave had sexual contact with two female children. John Winthrop'saccount of the case described the act as \"agitation and effusion ofseed.\" Vaginal penetration was also alleged, but was denied by8 The phrase is Foucault's description of sodomy. MICHEL FOUCAULT, A HISTORY OFSEXUALITY 101 (Robert Hurley trans., 1978).9 INTIMATE MATrRs, supra note 6, at 16, 30. As one court later stated, \"[A]l unnaturalacts of carnal copulation between man with man or man with woman, where a penetrationis effected into any opening of the body other than those provided by nature for thereproduction of the species, are sufficiently contemplated and embraced within the term'infamous crime against nature ....... In Ex parte Benites, 140 P. 436, 437'(Nev. 1914)(citing WILLIAM HAWKINS, PLEAS OF THE CROWN (1787)).10 Prohibitions against oral sex were added later. Sodomy also sometimes referred tointercourse between a human and an animal. The fullest exposition of the history of sodomylaw can be found in Anne B. Goldstein, History, Homosexuality, and Political Values:Searching for the Hidden Determinants of Bowers v. Hardwick, 97 YALE L.J. 1073, 1081-87 (1988).1992]534 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review [Vol. 27the defendants.\" The Massachusetts Bay Colony at that time hadnot yet adopted a formal body of laws, and the colony's leadershipwas unsure with which violation of criminal law to charge thesemen and whether their offense merited capital punishment. 2 As aresult, the governor asked jurists and church elders in that colonyand in Plymouth whether the defendants' behavior constituted a\"sodomitical act,\" punishable by death.13As these colonists understood sodomy and rape, 14 the primarylegal question at issue was whether proof of penetration was nec-essary to sustain an offense meriting the death penalty. Bradfordand one of the Plymouth clergymen contended that proof of pen-etration was required. The two others argued that non-penetrativeacts which led to ejaculation and the \"spilling of seed\" were com-parable in infamy to penetrative crimes and should be equallypunished. As one minister put it, the spilling of seed \"is equivalentto killing the man who could have been born out of it.\"'15Apparently, none of the disputants suggested that the same-sex phrasing of the Biblical injunction that a \"man shall not liewith a man as with a woman\" precluded a sodomy charge in acase involving male-female conduct, even though that commandwas cited repeatedly as the original source of the law and as thebasis for an analogy to the case before them.' 6 As Jonathan NedKatz notes in his summary of the incident, \"[tihat this discussionof 'sodomy' was motivated by a crime of male against femaleillustrates the colonists' relative lack of preoccupation with genderin their categorizing of sexual acts and their relative emphasis onother characteristics of those acts.' 1 7 The willingness to consider\" JOHN WINTHROP, THE HISTORY OF NEW ENGLAND FROM 1630 TO 1649: VOLUMEII 54-55 (1853).12 The case is described most fully in JONATHAN NED KATZ, GAY/LESBIAN ALMANAC78-82 (1983).,3 See WILLIAM BRADFORD, OF PLYMOUTH PLANTATION 1620-1647, 318-19 (SamuelEliot Morison ed., 1966).'4 The colonists concluded that the men could not be punished with the death sentencefor rape because there was neither a statute nor \"express law in the word of God\" thatjustified such a sentence for rape of an \"unripe\" girl, and because there was not sufficientproof of penetration. See WINTHROP, supra note 11, at 56. Additionally, the colonistsbelieved there was an issue of consent, since at least one of the girls was reported to have\"grown capable of man's fellowship, and took pleasure in it.\" Id. at 55.' KATz, supra, note 12, at 79-82; BRADFORD, supra note 13, at 404-13.6 BRADFORD, supra note 13, at 404-13. Presumably because of the disagreement overwhich elements were necessary to the crime, the men were eventually charged with \"carnalknowledge . .. in a most vile & abominal manner\" and with \"abusing\" the girls in an\"unclean & wicked manner.\" KATZ, supra note 12, at 78.\" KATZ, supra note 12, at 78. At least one commentator has read the meaning of thisLife After Hardwicksodomy as meaning something more than same-sex conduct in thisinstance is all the more notable since it was only the New Englandstates-including Massachusetts-which later used a same-sex def-inition in their early statutes.\"'This seventeenth-century debate illustrates fundamental prob-lems that continue to muddle the law of sexuality. First, the Mas-sachusetts Bay Colony debate exemplifies the indeterminacy atthe very core of the concept of sodomy. Lacking a statutory def-inition, the Massachusetts Colony elites drew on their understand-ing of English law and Biblical prohibitions in an attempt to reacha jointly acceptable interpretation. Their difficulty in doing sosignified that then, as now, the term sodomy lacked a fixed culturalor social meaning. Although same-sex conduct was included aspart of the meaning of sodomy, its boundaries were drawn by therequirements of penetration and nonprocreative acts.Most colonial sodomy laws regulated sexual acts solely bymen, whether with other men or with women. Proof of phallicpenetration was needed to sustain a conviction for sodomy notbecause the crime focused on same-sex conduct, but because itsprohibitions were directed at men. Official acknowledgment ofsexual acts between women within the statutory text was rare,although enforcement of some statutes against women was initi-ated under colonial laws.19 Later codifications of or amendmentsto sodomy laws encompassed sexual acts between women.20debate differently, as \"the exception that proves the rule\" that \"the Puritans nearly alwaysmeant homosexuality when they used the term sodomy.\" Robert F. Oaks, \"Things Fearfulto Name\": Sodomy and Buggery in Seventeenth Century New England, 12 J. Soc. HIST.268, 273 (1978). However, D'Emilio and Freedman reject the Oaks interpretation of sodomyin their book which is the leading synthesis of the historical research. INTIMATE MATTERS,supra note 6, at 30. If nothing else, these different readings demonstrate the enduringcontestability of the term.18 Goldstein, supra note 10, at 1083 n.60.19 KATZ, supra note 12, at 54-60; INTIMATE MATTERS, supra note 6, at 30-31.20 The Georgia statute before the Supreme Court in Hardwick illustrates this pattern.In 1939 the state supreme court overturned the conviction of a woman charged with sodomyfor oral sex with another woman on the ground that phallic penetration was a requiredelement of the crime. Thompson v. Aldridge, 200 S.E.2d 799 (Ga. 1939). In Riley v. Garret,133 S.E.2d 367 (Ga. 1963), the same court held that heterosexual cunnilingus also was notcovered. In 1968 the legislature amended the statute to include cunnilingus. Justice Black-mun incorrectly characterized this amendment as a relatively recent decision by the legis-lature to include heterosexual conduct within the scope of the statue. Bowers v. Hardwick,478 U.S. 186, 200 n.1 (1986) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). At the time of the amendment,heterosexual conduct was already included; it was the possibility of non-phallic conductthat constituted the modem intervention.1992]536 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review [Vol. 27If the direct prohibitory effect was on men, however, theindirect and obligatory effect fell heavily on women because thelaw sought to force all sexual activities to be at least potentiallyprocreative. The repulsion expressed by the two Plymouth cler-gymen for the \"spilling of seed\" was triggered by the nonprocrea-tive nature of the defendants' acts. This same aim of the law-discouragement of nonprocreative sex-underlay the statutes pro-hibiting the use of birth control devices which were stricken asunconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the 1960s. 21 Ironically,in Hardwick, the Court concluded that a privacy claim on behalfof \"homosexual sodomy\" bore no relationship to those earlierdecisions: \"[n]o connection between . . . procreation on the onehand and homosexual activity on the other has been demonstrated.... 22 In fact, the exact opposite was the case. Michael Hard-wick, as a person engaged in sodomy, had the same relationshipto procreation as persons using birth control during heterosexualintercourse: none, which was precisely the point. The issue inHardwick should have been controlled by Griswold andEisenstadt.Illustrated by a comparison of the Massachusetts Bay Colonydebate to Hardwick, the second major shift in the law of sexualityis the role ascribed to \"identity.\" The debate 350 years ago wasclearly a dispute about acts and about which acts, in some specificdetail, constituted a particular crime. It could easily be analogizedto a debate about the elements necessary for burglary or robbery;about, for example, what the charge should be if property is stolenfrom a person or removed from a home. It is not a debate abouta type of person, any more than one discusses theft in terms oftwo distinct types of human beings-the robbers and the burglars.The law does not assume that a certain personality type will com-mit theft one way, and another personality type, another way.Anyone could be guilty of either kind of conduct, depending onthe facts of the particular incident.The difference illustrates one of the central arguments ofFrench philosopher Michel Foucault, who wrote that social regu-21 Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479(1965). In an earlier case in which the Court found lack of standing and thus never reachedthe merits, Justice Harlan in dissent noted that Connecticut asserted in defense of its banon contraceptives that \"it considers the practice of contraception immoral in itself.\" Poev. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 545 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting).22 478 U.S. at 191.Life After Hardwicklation of sexuality was transformed during the eighteenth and nine-teenth centuries in part bya new specification of individuals. As defined by the an-cient civil or canonical codes, sodomy was a category offorbidden acts; their perpetrator was nothing more thanthe juridical subject of them. The nineteenth-centuryhomosexual became a personage, a past, a case history,and a childhood, in addition to being a type of life, a lifeform, and a morphology. 23Sex between two women or between two men has been recordedfor centuries, but the understanding of what those acts signifiesabout the persons participating in them has shifted radically. \"[]tnever occurred to pre-modern cultures to ascribe a person's sexualtastes to some positive, structural, or constitutive feature of hisor her personality. 24A rich new vein of historical analysis has begun to trace theevolutionary changes in the social meaning of sexual practices,including sodomy2 One British historian has argued that the shiftin popular meaning of the term \"sodomite\"-from that of a libertinemale sexually active with both women and men to that of aneffeminate male interested only in other men-can be pinpointedto the first half of the eighteenth century.26 The word \"homosexual\"and the idea that the homosexual was a different kind of personwere developed by late-nineteenth-century sexologists proposingmedicalized causation theories for sexual behavior.2721 FOUCAULT, supra note 8, at 42-43 (emphasis in original).24 HALPERIN, supra note 6, at 27.75 In addition to the works cited in notes 6 and 12, see PASSION AND POWER: SEXUALITYIN HISTORY (Kathy Peiss & Christina Simmons eds., 1989); JOHN D'EMILIo, SEXUALPOLITICS, SEXUAL COMMUNITIES: THE MAKING OF A HOMOSEXUAL MINORITY IN THEUNITED STATES, 1940-1970 (1983); LILLIAN FADERMAN, SURPASSING THE LOVE OF MEN:ROMANTIC FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE BETWEEN WOMEN FROM THE RENAISSANCE TO THEPRESENT (1981); JONATHAN NED KATZ, GAY AMERICAN HISTORY: LESBIANS AND GAYMEN IN THE U.S.A.

Indeed, one of the first bases onwhich such laws were challenged was the very question of con-fusion. A number of statutes that prohibited the \"crime againstnature\" without defining it were challenged on grounds of vague-ness, although most were upheld with limiting constructions. 28In the last twenty years, however, the dominant legislativetrend has been specification. The first state to decriminalize so-domy was Illinois in 1961; in the next twenty years, nearly halfthe states decriminalized all sodomy, usually by adoption of ModelPenal Code recommendations that included repeal of sodomy stat-utes. 29 The last repeal of a sodomy law occurred in Wisconsin in1983. Starting in the 1970s, however, a countertrend began inwhich specification has replaced repeal. Since 1973, eight stateshave amended their laws to specify that oral or anal sex is prohib-ited only between persons of the same sex. 30 In one state, Okla-28 Some state statutes still use phrases like \"crime against nature.\" See, e.g., ARMz.REV.

A Florida statute, FLA.STAT. § 800.01 (Supp. 1973), prohibiting \"the abominable and detestable crime againstnature\" was upheld against a vagueness attack in Wainwright v. Stone, 414 U.S. 21 (1973)(per curiam). In a non-retroactive ruling that occurred after the conviction in Wainwright,the Florida Supreme Court found the same statute to be unconstitutionally vague. Franklinv. State, 257 So.2d 21 (Fla. 1971). The Florida court suggested that the application of thecrime against nature statute to oral sex \"could entrap unsuspecting citizens and subjectthem to 20-year sentences... [which] would no doubt be a shocking revelation to personswho do not have an understanding of the meaning of the statute.\" Id. at 23.

The specification trend coincided with theemergence of the contemporary versions of both the lesbian andgay rights movement and a renewed movement for religious fun-damentalism in American politics. In 1973, the year in which spec-ification amendments began, two critical events occurred: TheAmerican Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality fromits list of mental diseases 33 and the United States Civil ServiceCommission forbade federal personnel supervisers from finding aperson unsuitable for a federal government job based solely onhomosexuality. 34 By 1975, anti-discrimination laws had beenadopted by the District of Columbia, San Francisco, Los Angeles,Minneapolis, Philadelphia and several smaller cities.35 Anti-equal-ity forces mobilized during the 1970s also, however, securing re-peal of a civil rights law in Dade County, Florida, and conductingtwo electoral campaigns to enact laws mandating the firing of stateschool system employees who advocated homosexuality: one un-successfully (California), the other successfully (Oklahoma).36 Forstates revising their criminal codes, the specification of homosex-Dist.

Along with Michael Hard-wick, a husband and wife couple joined as plaintiffs. They weredismissed for lack of standing, however, in part because the districtand appellate courts concluded that because they were heterosex-ual, they had less at stake. 37John and Mary Doe asserted that they desired to engage insodomy but had been \"chilled\" and \"deterred\" by the statute.Hardwick, by contrast, asserted that he regularly engaged in so-domy. The Court of Appeals viewed each of them as claiming\"that their normal course of activity will lead them to violate thestatute, completely apart from their desire to invalidate it.\" 38 Yet,the court ruledHardwick's status as a homosexual adds special credenceto his claim .... While a plaintiff hoping only to challengea statute might overestimate his or her willingness to riskactual prosecution, a plaintiff who genuinely desires toengage in conduct regardless of its legal status presentsa court with a more plausible threat of futureprosecution. 39This contributed to what the court referred to as \"the authenticityof Hardwick's desire to engage in the proscribed activity in thefuture, '40 necessarily imputing less authenticity or desire to themarried couple.37 Hardwick v. Bowers, 760 F.2d 1202, 1204-06 (11th Cir. 1985). Standing to challengea statute on its face, absent an actual prosecution, necessitates a showing both that theplaintiff is likely to engage in conduct that runs afoul of the statute and that the governmentis likely to enforce the statute. Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n., 484 U.S. 383,392-93 (1988). In Hardwick, both aspects were found to be missing for the husband-wifecouple.3Hardwick, 760 F.2d at 1205.39 Id.40 Id. at 1206.Life After HardwickThe Court of Appeals' application of standing doctrine prefi-gured the Supreme Court's conflation of homosexuality with so-domy. The Court of Appeals could have limited its rationale forthe standing ruling only to incidents of past enforcement or toclaims of current illegal activity. Instead, however, it suggestedthat only a homosexual could be genuinely interested in engagingin oral sex, the act for which Michael Hardwick was arrested. Thelanguage of the standing ruling reflects a belief that the categories\"homosexual\" and \"heterosexual\" denote radically different ex-periences of the same behavior.The denial of standing to the husband and wife plaintiffs soundermined a general theory of sexual privacy that in some re-spects, the whole story of Hardwick is revealed in the ruling onstanding. It removed the two plaintiffs who represented the fullscope of the sodomy law from the litigation, and set up a factualcontext in which the Supreme Court could adjudicate the statute'sconstitutionality solely \"as applied to consensual homosexualsodomy. '41From there, the Court's opinion embarks on a series of slip-pery substitutions between generally prohibited conduct and thecivic status of a class of people. The Court moves back and forthfrom discussion of \"homosexual sodomy\" 42 to \"the fundamentalrights of homosexuals\" 43 to \"the claimed constitutional right ofhomosexuals to engage in acts of sodomy\"44 to \"the morality ofhomosexuality. ' 45 The Court equates a subset of acts with therights of a class.In so doing, the Court rewrote history to reflect a contempo-rary preoccupation with homosexuality. The majority ignored whatJustice Stevens in dissent accurately described as \"the traditionalview that sodomy is an immoral kind of conduct regardless of theidentity of the persons who engage in it. ' 46 Instead, having framedthe scope of the case as \"homosexual sodomy,\" the Court recap-itulated the history of sodomy law as though it, too, were limitedto homosexuality.4\" Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 188 n.2 (1986).42 Id. at 189, 190.43 Id. at 189, 190.4Id. at 190-91.45 Id. at 196.46 Id. at 216 (Stevens, J., dissenting).1992]542 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law ReviewThe difference here is important for reasons of more thanhistorical accuracy. The Court used its version of history to claima kind of moral authority as much as, or more than, to discern theviews of the framers. Although homosexual sexual conduct hadbeen the subject of legal proscription under colonial statutes, itwas no more prohibited than some consensual heterosexual sexualbehaviors often subject to the same penalties.47 The majority usedits misreading of history to justify the condemnation of homosex-uality, a condemnation that has been transformed by subsequentcourts into the holding of the case.The result is an extremely paradoxical configuration of opin-ions. Because the dissenters endorse a more liberal or tolerantinterpretation of the meaning of privacy, they may be thought alsoto represent a more progressive, more forward-looking, less his-tory-bound approach than the majority. The majority builds on ahistory of censure as the primary foundation for continuing thatcensure. Yet, it was the dissents, especially that of Justice Stevens,which got the history right, refusing to distort previous meaningsof sodomy by reading into them a contemporary obsession withhomosexuality. The irony is that the dissent, rather than the ma-jority, has history on its side.Concomitantly, however, the conservative majority couldclaim modernity in support of its focus on homosexuality. Contem-porary social norms-as distinct from the history of sodomylaws-do include a remaking of the understanding of which sexualpractices are condemned. New social understandings have con-verted sodomy into a code word for homosexuality, regardless ofthe statutory definition. 48 Thus, ironically, the world view of amajority that believed its decision to be anchored in \"millennia ofmoral teaching\"49 was actually quite contemporary in its funda-mental approach, as well as dependent on recent social trends.The source of authority that the majority claimed most fervently,47 INTIMATE MATTERS, supra note 6, at 28-30; GREENBERG, supra note 26, at 304;KATz, supra note 12, at 68, 74, 76, 85, 101.48 Judges Canby and Norris of the Ninth Circuit are on solid legal ground when theyargue that Hardwick is not \"a state license to pass 'homosexual laws.\"' Watkins v. U.S.Army, 847 F.2d 1329, 1354 (9th Cir. 1988), vacated and aff'd on other grounds, 875 F.2d699 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 384 (1990).

Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 197 (1986) (Burger, C.J., concurring).[Vol. 27Life After Hardwickhowever-a strict adherence to the world view of the framers-was an historical forgery.II. The Current DebateThe decision in Hardwick now bedevils virtually all litigationconcerning lesbian and gay rights claims. A series of federal courtdecisions have concluded that Hardwick precludes any heightenedreview under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth and Four-teenth Amendments for classifications based on sexual orientation.A minority of judges have written that the Equal Protection ques-tion is still open. In effect, American jurists are still asking, 350years after the Massachusetts Bay Colony debate, what does so-domy mean? As Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the Ninth Circuit haswritten, \"either Hardwick is about 'sodomy' . . . or it is about'homosexuality. \"50The emerging majority position, adopted by the Seventh,Ninth, D.C. and Federal Circuits, is that Hardwick is about hom-osexuality. The opinions constituting this position share in com-mon a conclusion that because homosexual sodomy can be madecriminal and because that \"conduct defines the class,\" homosex-uals as a group can be regulated by the state with no greaterjustification than is required under the traditional rational basistest.51This conduct-centered view is premised on a radical imbal-ance. The act of homosexual sodomy \"defines the class\" of gaymen and lesbians, but the same act of sodomy between oppositesex partners does not \"define the class\" of heterosexuals. Heter-osexuality discreetly disappears as a category of persons definedby sex. Homosexual sodomy, on the other hand, not only becomesthe totality of sodomy, it also becomes the totality ofhomosexuality.Only Judge Reinhardt among the proponents of the conduct-centered approach has sought fully to engage with this contradic-tion. He acknowledges that the behavior in question, oral or anal\" Watkins, 847 F.2d at 1354 (Reinhardt, J., dissenting).51 See High-Tech Gays v.

Cir. 1987).1992]544 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Reviewsex, is practiced by \"a substantial majority\" of both heterosexualand homosexual persons. Indeed, the frequency of this conduct isquite similar for the two groups .52 Reinhardt justifies the differ-ential that he reads Hardwick to establish (but which he does notendorse) as based on the difference that, for homosexuals alone,such behavior \"is fundamental to their very nature. '53The illogic of the Reinhardt view, and also of the rationale forthe standing decision in Hardwick, inheres in the effort to base afinding of intrinsic difference on precisely that which is similar.The acts at issue in Hardwick-i.e., sodomy as defined by theGeorgia statute-are the very acts that the two groups share incommon. If there are specific sexual practices that explain thedifference between the two groups, it must be those practices thatare missing from one group and present for the other. That conductis procreative sexuality.Although the distinction based on procreation has been ig-nored in the sodomy cases, where its recognition would lead to anextension of the Griswold-Eisenstadt principle to homosexualacts, it has been relied on in other contexts to defeat lesbian andgay rights claims. In Singer v. Hara, gay plaintiffs invoked a stateequal rights amendment that prohibited any differential treatmentbased on sex, arguing that the marriage law could not bar a manfrom marrying a man if he could marry a woman. The WashingtonCourt of Appeals rejected this argument, reasoning that the con-trolling difference was the \"impossibility of reproduction,\" a dis-tinction sufficient to constitute a unique physical characteristic ofthe sexes, and thus a defense to an ERA claim.54The status-centered view has the better legal argument; it istruer to the holding of Hardwick. It insists that the power of thestate to prohibit certain conduct must be applied evenhandedly. 55It is more intellectually honest. If one imagines, for example, that52 Data indicate that 96-99% of gay and lesbian persons have engaged in oral sex anda smaller proportion in anal sex. PHILIP BLUMSTEIN & PEPPER SCHWARTZ, AMERICANCOUPLES 236, 242 (1983). From 90 to 93% of heterosexual persons have engaged in oralsex and a smaller proportion in anal sex. Id.5 Watkins, 847 F.2d at 1357 (Reinhardt, J., dissenting).54 Singer v. Hara, 522 P.2d 1187, 1195 (Wash. App. 1974).55 Watkins, 847 F.2d at 1340-41.

City of Chicago, 686 F.2d 511, 522-24 (7th Cir. 1982)(even under rational basis standard of review, Chicago Fire Department could not dischargeonly one of two paramedics who were equally involved in and equally responsible for anincident involving the death of an elderly man).[Vol. 27Life After HardwickHardwick had been decided the other way, such that the privacyright covered acts including homosexual sodomy, there would notbe automatic invalidation of sexual orientation classifications un-der an Equal Protection test. If we had won Hardwick, we wouldnot automatically, ipso facto, win a challenge to the military'sexclusion of lesbian and gay service members. The governmentwould still be able to argue (I believe incorrectly) that it should beentitled to create a sexual orientation classification based on fac-tors unrelated to whether particular conduct was criminal. 56 Thesame distinction between privacy and equality holds in the oppo-site direction: Although we lost Hardwick, our claims under theEqual Protection Clause should not, ipso facto, be foreclosed. 7The weakness of the status-centered view is its erasure of allconduct and its focus solely on identity. Judges Canby and Norrisinsist that the class of persons who consider themselves homosex-ual is not \"virtually identical\" to those who engage in homosexualsodomy.5 8 They are boxed into this position by a need to distin-guish both Hardwick and Ninth Circuit precedent that held thatthere was no Equal Protection violation from the government se-lecting homosexual sodomy charges for heightened prosecution,even under a neutral sodomy law.59 Although lesbian and gaysexual expression does encompass many more acts than oral oranal sex alone, the Canby-Norris argument is unpersuasive in itsrefusal to acknowledge the substantial overlap.What the status-centered view substitutes for sexual acts asthe core meaning of homosexuality is a concept of identity that isjust as \"fundamental\" and essentializing as conduct is in the Rein-hardt approach. Under the status-centered view, sexual orientationm The government's primary argument in justification of its exclusionary policy is thatother service members and the public would react negatively to the presence of openly gaymen and lesbian women in the military and that barracks life would be made uncomfortable.See, e.g., Watkins, 847 F.2d at 1350-52. Whether this rationale amounts to more than theinvocation of prejudice may be tested in Pruitt v. Cheney, 943 F.2d 989 (9th Cir. 1991), inwhich the court reversed the dismissal of a lesbian plaintiff's Equal Protection claim againstthe policy, and directed the district court to determine whether the policy had a rationalbasis under the strict rational basis analysis of City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living CenterInc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985).57 Cass Sunstein has analyzed in detail the difference in function between the EqualProtection Clause and the Due Process Clause, and argued that Hardwick should not beread to determine the Equal Protection question in cases such as Watkins. Cass R. Sunstein,Sexual Orientation and the Constitution: A Note on the Relationship Between Due Processand Equal Protection, 55 U. CHI. L. REv. 1161 (1988).5 Watkins, 847 F.2d at 1339 n. 14.59 Hatheway v. Secretary of the Army, 641 F.2d 1376 (9th Cir. 1981).19921546 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Reviewis \"a central character of individual and group identity, '60 \"a cen-tral and defining aspect\" of every individual's personality. 6' Citingthe amicus brief filed by a gay rights advocacy group, JudgesCanby and Norris assert that \"one is a homosexual or a hetero-sexual while playing bridge just as much as while engaging insexual activity. ' '62Both the conduct-centered and the status-centered views il-lustrate the ascendancy of an identity definition in the debate overthe parameters of constitutional rights. The conduct-centered viewholds that what a person does determines what she is; the status-centered view argues that her sexuality is so central to her identitythat what she is exists independently of what she does. Bothapproaches would have the law institutionalize the category ofsexual orientation, albeit with radically different rationales andopposite outcomes. The former would permit the state to usehomosexual identity as the newest bullseye at which to aim re-pressive measures, while the latter would legitimate the same iden-tity as the basis for an egalitarian demand.III. Problems for the FutureIn lesbian and gay rights litigation that lies in the immediatefuture, correcting the misreading of Hardwick is only the firstbarrier to be overcome. Successfully distinguishing the questionof governmental power to penalize sexual acts from the indepen-dent question of whether classifications based on sexuality areimpermissibly invidious merely sets the stage for further complexquestions. Many of the thorniest challenges will come in trying tosubvert categorical modes of thinking about sexuality and sexualorientation, while still taking advantage of a civil rights heritagethat is grounded on identity politics.Breaking the gridlock of identity politics is no easy task. Thecivil rights claim remains the most powerful device for securingequality in American society, yet it is premised on recognition ofa coherent group identity. What often goes unspoken in the asser-tion of such a claim is the tension between the desire to deconstruct60 Watkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699, 726 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc).61 Jantz v. Muci, 759 F.Supp. 1543, 1548, 1551 (D. Kan. 1991) (appeal pending).2 High-Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, 909 F.2d 375, 380(9th Cir. 1990).[Vol. 27Life After Hardwickthe imprisoning category itself and the need to defend those per-sons who are disadvantaged because they bear the group label. 63This tension is particularly acute for lesbian and gay rightsadvocates, and will grow more so, for two reasons. First, theconstructionist-essentialist dispute currently dominates intellectualdebates on issues of sexuality 4 These debates have only begunto surface in the discourse of law, but they will inevitably spreadfrom the non-legal activists and academics now most engaged inthem to the courts. Second, much future litigation in this area willbe grounded on Equal Protection doctrine, which directs judicialattention to a history of group discrimination, a status of relativepolitical disempowerment and the indicia of identifiable groupstatus itself.65 Each of these criteria raises problems that are uniqueto lesbian and gay rights claims and that exemplify the strategicquestions inherent in those claims.Although a history of discrimination is perhaps the least con-tested of these criteria,6 the view among lesbian and gay historiansthat homosexuality did not exist as a concept distinct in kind fromother sexual behaviors until near the end of the last century callsinto question at least some of the more sweeping invocations ofoppression found in decisions that grant Equal Protection claims. 67The district judge in Jantz v. Muci, for example, wrote that \"stig-matization of homosexuals has 'persisted throughout history,across cultures.\"' f Hyperbole should not be necessary, however.A century of animosity has in fact created the kind of failure inthe political system that \"footnote four\" principles 69 are permittedto remedy.61 Carole S. Vance posed the dilemma as deconstruction versus defense in her exam-ination of the development of a social constructionist theory of sexuality. Carole S.

Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938).1992]548 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review [Vol. 27The second of the criteria for heightened scrutiny, powerless-ness in the legislative process, has become, surprisingly, a pointof disagreement in judicial assessments of classifications based onsexual orientation. Several courts have found that the election ofa handful of openly lesbian and gay officeholders, together withthe enactment of primarily municipal anti-discrimination laws,demonstrate that judicial intervention is unnecessary. 70 These de-cisions raise the threshold for heightened scrutiny to the point thatpast determinations could not stand if the new standard wereapplied retroactively.71A more fair-minded approach to the question of political pow-erlessness, however, will not necessarily be simple. Lesbian andgay Americans present the unique problem of a minority that isboth anonymous and diffuse and insular and discreet. As a popu-lation group, homosexually active persons live throughout the na-tion, but the combination of social penalty and lack of a visiblemarker leads to public anonymity. In many urban areas, on theother hand, self-conscious communities have formed that havegenerated a kind of ethnic politics founded on sexuality. As BruceAckerman has described, Equal Protection doctrine to date hasnot ventured beyond the surface in analyzing whether insulargroups are more or less disadvantaged in pluralist negotiationsthan diffuse groups, or whether pariah status (a minority so stig-matized that others are unwilling to work with them on any terms) 72or some lesser showing of prejudice is required for judicial inter-vention.73 Lesbian and gay rights claims may well be one of thevehicles that forces a closer, more refined examination of thesequestions.It is the last of these three criteria, however-often describedas an immutability requirement-that poses the most troublesome70 High-Tech Gays, 895 F.2d at 574; Steffan v. Cheney, 780 F. Supp. 1, 7-9 (D.D.C.1991).71 Judges Canby and Norris argue that race would never have been ruled a suspectclassification under this standard. High-Tech Gays, 909 F.2d 378 (9th Cir. 1990) (rehearingen banc denied). That is also true with regard to women, who were granted heightenedprotection at a time when Congress had already enacted both the Equal Pay Act and broadanti-discrimination laws covering employment and education, numerous states had adoptedequal rights amendments to their constitutions and a federal equal rights amendment wasunder active consideration. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976); Frontiero v. Richard-son, 411 U.S. 677 (1973) (plurality).72 Judges Canby and Norris concluded that homosexuals in fact do constitute politicalpariahs.

The immutability criterion forces into the forefront thequestion of what causes differing sexual orientations, a questionthat is by no means settled. Advocates of a rights claim for lesbiansand gay men typically have invoked an essentialist position, ar-guing that even the most literal interpretation of immutability issatisfied if the origins of sexual orientation lie in genes or geneticcodes, hormones or brain structure.74 Opponents of the rightsclaim have focused on the volitional nature of sexual conduct. 75Judges Canby and Norris have framed the issue as one of statecoercion, rather than absolute physical inability to change or dis-guise a trait.76 Janet Halley argues that it is the very mutability ofsexual identity, and its creation by the process of a social andpolitical discourse, which should entitle it to heightened protec-tion; otherwise the political process is skewed and delegitimizedby the systematic silencing of one voice in that discussion. 77 Hal-ley's approach helpfully lifts the question out of the realm ofphysiological determinism, a realm where, at least at present, it isfactually unresolvable.Eschewing an essentialist claim need not be a tactical weak-ness for equal rights advocates. Biological immutability is not anabsolute prerequisite to invalidating classifications on the basis ofthat trait.78 Aliens can and do become citizens; persons can and74 The most recent support for this position can be found in two studies, one concludingthat there may be a difference in brain structure based on sexual orientation and the secondpositing a genetic difference.

REv. 915 (1989).78 The question of whether immutability is required arises in overlapping analysesunder both Equal Protection Clause claims and claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). In someopinions in the former line of cases, the Supreme Court has seemed to require immutability.Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 6861992]550 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review [Vol. 27do alter their religious faith group 'affiliations. 79 Neither group ispenalized for the refusal to change, even though change is possible.Most courts in Equal Protection cases have simply listed im-mutability as a component of the heightened scrutiny test withoutconsidering its ramifications. Implicit and largely unexamined inthe immutability doctrine is a political choice about the social valueof the trait in question. Here too, lesbian and gay rights claimshave a potential to reshape Equal Protection jurisprudence byshifting the focus from whether a particular trait is inherited and/or impossible to alter, to whether individuals are being coercedinto conforming to a certain set of behaviors.Although Equal Protection cases may be the most frequentcontext for lesbian and gay rights litigants, the conceptual andpolitical problems that lie ahead transcend Equal Protection doc-trine. Whichever doctrinal cards advocates play, they will becountered with arguments born of deep cultural anxiety aboutsexuality. In the hope of furthering the deconstructionist projectwithout torpedoing the necessary work of defense, I offer threegeneral suggestions for framing interventions in this discourse.First, whatever the history of the meaning of homosexuality,it now cannot be divorced from social conflicts over the meaningsof masculinity and femininity. It is not acts alone, but those actsin conjunction with same-gender desire that marks homosexuality.(1973). Cf. Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 657 (1973) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Onother occasions, the Court has analyzed the criteria for heightened scrutiny without men-tioning immutability. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 n.14 (1982); Graham v. Richardson,403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971). As to § 1985(3), \"[i]t is a close question\" whether its protectionswill be extended to a group asserting g class-based animus on any ground other than race.United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners v. Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 836 (1983). Lowercourt decisions, which the Supreme Court may soon review, have extended such protectionto women. National Organization for Women v. Operation Rescue, 914 F.2d 582 (4th Cir.1990), review granted sub nom. Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 111 S. Ct. 1070(1991).Some courts have rejected the search for an immutable trait, even with regard to race.\"The notion of race is a taxonomic device and, as with all such constructs, it exists in thehuman mind, not as a division in the objective universe.\" Ortiz v. Bank of America, 547F. Supp. 550, 565 (E.D. Cal. 1982). Professor Halley argues that the Supreme Court hasrecognized, at least implicitly, that race is socially constructed rather than immutable. SeeHalley, supra note 71, at 924-26, discussing Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb, 481 U.S.615 (1987) and Saint Francis College v. A-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604 (1987).79 Alien status was granted heightened protection under the Equal Protection Clausein Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971). Religious affiliation, of course, is indepen-dently protected under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. It has also beenaccepted as a ground that is entitled to protection under § 1985(3) despite its mutability,although \"that issue is not free from doubt.\" Ravenstahl v. Thomas Jefferson Hospital, 37Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) 38,330, 38,332 (E.D.Pa. 1985).1992] Life After Hardwick 551\"Homosexuals are physically attracted to members of their ownsex. That is the source of the behavior that we notice aboutthem.\"80 Gender is central to sexual orientation, 81 and much of thepositive social value of homosexuality lies in its creation of a zoneof anti-orthodoxy for men and women, of whatever sexualorientation. 82Second, to paraphrase the issue of Hardwick's meaning asposed by Judge Reinhardt, sodomy may be about privacy, buthomosexuality is not. The primary rationales for discrimination,as well as the arenas in which it occurs and is experienced, concernpublic perceptions, not private events. The issue that has gener-ated most of the current judicial debate-the military's personnelpolicy declaring homosexuality to be incompatible with militaryservice-is about secret versus public identity rather than aboutstatus versus conduct. The military does not seek to justify its80 High-Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, 909 F.2d 375, 377(9th Cir. 1990) (Canby, Norris, JJ., dissenting from denial of hearing en banc).81 The animus directed toward lesbian and gay Americans as a result of their sexualorientation constitutes discrimination on the basis of gender in two respects. First, andmost obviously, discrimination based on sexual orientation is a differentiation based on thegender of one's partner. In Hardwick the dissenting justices argued that the Court shouldhave reached the Equal Protection claim that the sodomy statute was selectively enforcedagainst persons committing homosexual acts, and decided it on gender discriminationgrounds:I do not see why the State can defend [the statute] on the ground that individualssingled out for prosecution are of the same sex as their partners. Thus, under thecircumstances of this case, a claim under the Equal Protection Clause may wellbe available without having to reach the more controversial question of whetherhomosexuals are a suspect class.Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 203 n.2 (1986) (Blackmun, Brennan, Marshall andStevens, JJ., dissenting). This theory of sex discrimination has been rejected, however, inTitle VII cases. DeSantis v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co., 608 F.2d 327 (9th Cir. 1979); Smith v.Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 569 F.2d 325 (5th Cir. 1978); Holloway v. Arthur Andersen &Co., 566 F.2d 659 (9th Cir. 1977).Second, and more fundamentally, homosexuality has long been viewed as a deviationfrom the proper gender norms, and thus lesbian and gay persons are often held in contemptas \"queer\" specifically in relation to differing codes of behavior for males and females. SeeINTIMATE MA-rERS, supra note 6, at 226. Several commentators have articulated argumentsthat the centrality of gender norms and sex-role stereotypes to notions of homosexualityshould be the basis for the invalidation of laws that differentiate on grounds of sexualorientation.

Innumerous other cases, the asserted state interest used to justifydiscrimination was a fear that equal treatment would be perceivedby the public as an endorsement of homosexuality.8 3 It is the publicprocess of creation, assignment and use of sexual identity-notthe right to keep private conduct secret-on which future litigationwill focus.Lastly, lesbian and gay rights advocates must recast the termsof the debate as to the state's interest in morality-an interest thathas been found sufficient to justify both gender neutral14 and same-sex only85 sodomy statutes, as well as the military's anti-gay per-sonnel policy.86 In each of these opinions, the court interpreted\"morality\" to mean the suppression of homosexuality, a goal ac-cepted as a public good.8 7 So long as discouragement of homosex-uality is treated as a legitimate state interest, resolving such dis-putes as the immutability debate is likely to be pointless. Even ifa predisposition to homoeroticism is substantially inborn, the gov-ernment still can determine to seek a cure, or justify laws thatimpose a social cost on its expression as a means to diminish itspublic visibility, if not its private manifestations.Whatever the merits of the argument that the governmentshould not be permitted to enforce a public morality because ofprinciples of limited government, it is likely to be largely unavail-8 Gay Rights Coalition of Georgetown University Law Center v.

In 1963, RobertBork, then a law professor, argued against enactment of a federalcivil rights statute on the grounds that the moral view it embod-ied-that segregation was wrong-should not be enforced by thepower of the state.8 9 In the Dronenburg decision, two decadeslater, Judge Bork ridiculed the argument made by the gay plaintiffthat law was not and should not be based on morality. 90 Whateverchange of heart Judge Bork may have had as to the role of gov-ernment, it is also true that during the interval the rhetoric ofmorality adopted by those seeking change was appropriated bythose defending the status quo. Perhaps the biggest challenge les-bian and gay rights advocates face is the need to shift that rhetoriconce again.IV. ConclusionThe category \"homosexuality\" embodies the intersection ofnonprocreative sexual acts, the basis of sodomy laws, with same-gender desire. Law has contributed massively to the constructionof the idea of homosexuality as a significant marker of humanidentity, never more dramatically than in Bowers v. Hardwick,when the Supreme Court's will to distinguish and specify homo-sexual from heterosexual acts overrode the statutory text beforeit. The analysis in Hardwick and its progeny supplies both sidesin the lesbian and gay rights debate with models for a coherentgroup identity and definition. Although critics of many of theassumptions in this discourse seek to deconstruct the category ofhomosexuality as a fixed and natural marker, that effort shouldnot be misconstrued as a message that the category is insignificant,Is Indeed, a plurality of the Court has accepted morality as a sufficient state interestfor a statute banning nude dancing, despite its admitted restrictive effects on expression.Barnes v.

    "abstract": "Unless or until it is narrowed or overruled, Bowers v. Hardwick will dominate the law concerning government regulation of sexuality. In Hardwick the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional a Georgia sodomy statute that made oral or anal intercourse a felony punishable by up to twenty years in prison. The Court ended its long reluctance to assess the constitutionality of limitations on sexuality as distinct from contraception by ruling that the protected zone created by the privacy right stops short of covering private consensual sexual relations between adults. In so ruling, the Court left in place a patchwork of prohibitory laws in which identical acts are immunized or criminalized as one traverses state borders",
