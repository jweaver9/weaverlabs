LANG* INTRODUCTION Six months after his inauguration as President of the United States, in a July 2017 tweet, U.S. President Donald J. Trump announced his administration’s plan to ban openly transgender individuals from serving in the United States’ Armed Forces (hereinafter the “transgender service ban”).1 This decision reverses a 2016 Obama administration decision permitting openly transgender persons to serve in the U.S. military.2 Later, Trump formalized his order, issuing a Presidential Memorandum on August 25, 2017.3 “First, the Memorandum indefinitely extends a prohibition against transgender individuals entering the military, a process formally referred to as “accession” . . . . Second, the Memorandum requires the military to authorize, by no later than March 23, 2018, the discharge of transgender service members.”4 The memorandum singles out the costs of providing healthcare to transgender service members as a primary catalyst of the order, with a specific focus on care related to sexual transition.5 This memorandum  Copyright © 2018 by Matthew J.

This is so because of the state of domestic constitutional law in relation to transgender status,9 and the strength of presidential powers over national security and the military.10 The international human rights law framework provides advocates with an alternate body of law, and alternate forums, including—most importantly—treaty monitoring bodies [TMBs], through which  surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex.”).  6.

On December 22, 2017, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the Trump administration’s emergency request for a stay pending appeal, see Doe 1 v. Trump, No. 17—5267, 2017 WL 6553389 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 22, 2017), citing the administration’s failure to “satisf[y] the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal, as the rationale behind the denial. The Department of Defense thereafter refused to appeal the D.C. Circuit’s ruling, clearing the way for transgender recruits to enlist in the military in January 2018. See Lawrence Hurley, Idrees Ali, & REUTERS, US Military to Accept Transgender Recruits after Justice Department Decides not to Appeal Court Ruling, BUSINESS INSIDER (Dec. 29, 2017), http://www.businessinsider.com/transgender-recruits-allowed-to-serve-in-military-2017-12. Media sources report however, that the Trump administration has not entirely given up appealing the original ruling by the District Court holding the ban unconstitutional. Id. (quoting “an anonymous Justice Department Official”) (“The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime.”). Therefore, while the administration’s refusal to appeal the denial of the emergency stay pending appeal is a positive sign that domestic litigation surrounding the transgender military ban is succeeding, it remains to be seen whether the administration will later continue the appeal of the district court’s original decision. In any event, examining alternate fora for advocacy challenging the transgender service ban remains a worthwhile endeavor, if only to raise awareness about the overall status of discrimination against transgender persons in the United States. The transgender service ban serves as a prime example of the type of discrimination faced by transgender people, and using the administration’s action as demonstrative of such discrimination may force action on other fronts of discrimination as well.  9.

Lang Macro word doc (Do Not Delete) 5/8/2018  9:06 PM  INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE TRANSGENDER SERVICE BAN 251 challenges to the transgender service ban, and other forms of discrimination against the transgender community—of which the transgender service ban is highly exemplary—can be levied. This paper will examine the applicability of international human rights law to the transgender service ban, with the objective of determining the most effective means of challenging the transgender service ban through the human rights framework. First, I briefly examine United States constitutional law as it has been applied to the transgender community, and law concerning presidential power over military and national security matters. This discussion demonstrates how domestic law, alone, may not be enough to derail the Trump administration’s plan to ban transgender service. Second, I examine international human rights law, with specific focus on the conventions, treaties, and customary law most apt to provide for a successful challenge to the military service ban. Third, I examine how international human rights law may be used to challenge the transgender service ban, or other forms of state sanctioned discrimination against the transgender community. Fourth, I conclude with an examination of why advocates should,  despite the challenges presented, pursue a challenge to the transgender service ban under international human rights law. I. UNITED STATES DOMESTIC LAW A. Constitutional Challenges to Transgender Discrimination. The U.S. Constitution provides legal advocates with tools that can be used to challenge unequal treatment under the law,11 as well as any denial of liberty or property without due process of law.12 The Fifth Amendment was first used to prohibit discrimination on the basis of a protected classification in Bolling v. Sharpe, which dealt with racial discrimination in education in the District of Columbia.13 Expanding on the Brown v. Board doctrine, the Court, in Bolling held that the federal government was required to ensure equal protection under the law, just as states were required to so do under the Fourteenth Amendment.14 Later, in Reed v. Reed, the Court struck down a state statute that discriminated on the basis of sex, holding for the first time that sex-based discrimination violated the equal protection guarantees in the Fourteenth Amendment.15  While the Court has never had an opportunity to decide a case challenging a federal statute for discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of Fifth Amendment equal protection guarantees, the Court’s decision in the 2015 case United States v. Windsor, supports the general proposition that discrimination by the federal government on the basis of sex violates Fifth Amendment equal   11.  U.S. CONST. Amend. V; see also Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954).   12.  U.S. CONST. Amend. V.   13.  Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954) (holding that racial discrimination in schooling within the District of Columbia violated Equal Protection guarantees inherent in the Vth Amendment’s Due Process clause, which, as opposed to the XIV Amendment that only restricts actions taken by state governments, applies to the Federal government).  14.

However, recent Fourteenth Amendment challenges to state laws restricting access to public facilities on the basis of transgender identity have not been successful. In 2016, the Court effectively dismissed a high profile18 challenge to a Virginia state school bathroom ordinance, which required that students use school sex-segregated facilities that corresponded to their biological sex assigned at birth.19 Following a change in executive guidance involving federal anti-discrimination statute Title IX, the Court remanded the challenge to the Fourth Circuit where a preliminary injunction issued by the district court was ultimately vacated.20 In August 2017, that case, G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, was again before the Fourth Circuit, where the district court’s first decision in the case,21 which reserved decision on the equal protection challenge levied by the plaintiff against the defendant school board, was remanded once more for a determination about whether the entire challenge was rendered moot by the plaintiff’s graduation from the defendant school system.22 Several district courts have held that heightened scrutiny applies to practices challenged for discriminating against transgender status.23 But, consensus among authoritative precedent remains elusive. Several U.S. courts of appeals have held that transgender persons are protected from gender identity discrimination under a sex-equality equal protection theory.24 Evaluating claims under a sex-equality framework would lead to challenged government action being evaluated by courts   16.

This is because hearing courts evaluate not only the discriminatory acts challenged, but also the “important governmental objectives” at play, under heightened scrutiny.27 B. Executive Power Over Matters Involving National Security and the Military Military policies have historically been afforded a special degree of deference by reviewing courts—noticeably more than that afforded to other policies challenged for violating equal protection guarantees.28 In matters involving national security and the military, “the Constitution itself requires special deference” be afforded to decisions made by the legislature and the executive.29 “Aside from the Constitution itself, the need for deference also arises from the unique role that national defense plays in a democracy.”30 Ultimately, courts will defer to the political branches on matters involving national security and the military because “the imprimatur of the President, the Congress, or both imparts a degree of legitimacy to military decisions that courts cannot hope to confer.”31Although this deference does not immunize decisions concerning national security and the military from judicial review,32 “[t]he operation of a healthy deference to legislative and executive judgments in the area of military affairs is evident” in judicial hesitancy to consider challenges to decisions of the political branches in this space.33   25.  See Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982) (citations omitted) (“[T]he party seeking to uphold a statute that classifies individuals on the basis of their gender must carry the burden of showing an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for the classification. . . .  The burden is met only by showing at least that the classification serves “important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed” are “substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”).  26.

Absent Congressional action nullifying the President’s transgender service ban,35 judicial review of the ban by appellate courts under an equal protection framework has an acute risk of failure. That risk should caution against an advocacy strategy exclusively focused on litigating the ban in U.S. courts. II. INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW’S APPLICABILITY TO THE                    TRANSGENDER SERVICE BAN A. Applicability of Core Human Rights Treaties in the United States The United States has ratified several core human rights conventions that protect individual rights threatened by the transgender service ban. Among them are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [ICCPR],36 and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment [CAT].37 Additionally, the United States government’s signatures of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [ICESCR],38 and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women [CEDAW],39 impose obligations on the United States to “refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of [those] treat[ies].”40 While this signatory obligation—to refrain from conduct violative of the object and purpose of a  from draft registration).  34.  “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was ended by Congressional action and executive support in 2010. See 10 U.S.C. § 654, (repealed by Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, Pub.L. 111-321 § 2(f)(1)(A), Stat. 3516 (Dec. 22, 2010)); see also Elisabeth Bumiller, Obama Ends ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ Policy, N.Y. TIMES (July 22, 2011), http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/us/23military.html.  35.  The legislative response to the transgender service ban was swift, but failed just as swiftly. See HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN, Transgender Military Service, (accessed Dec. 10, 2017) (describing a bipartisan amendment introduced in the Senate to protect against transgender troops being discharged, and how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “ended debate before the amendment was able to receive a vote.” Also discussing bipartisan bills introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives that would achieve the same end.)  36.

The rights to be free from discrimination contained in Articles 2 and 26 of the ICCPR include the right of freedom from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,52 and the free-standing discrimination prohibition in Article 26 prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity.53 While sexual orientation and gender identity remain distinct facets of personal identity,54 the Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has noted that international law is increasingly recognizing the right of individuals to be free from discrimination based on their gender identities.55 Therefore, Article 2 would likely be interpreted to include a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of gender identity and transgender status, as well.

Additionally, given that substantive rights protected by the ICCPR are being violated by the transgender service ban, Article 2’s additional prohibition against discrimination is also applicable here.71 Among the substantive protections being violated is ICCPR Article 7’s prohibition against “torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.”72 Considering the serious impacts of transgender discrimination,73 the United States government is infringing on its duties under Article 7 to “protect . . . the dignity . . . and the mental integrity of the individual,” by actively excluding them from military service74 Additionally, the transgender service ban infringes upon individuals’ rights to “security of person” found in article 9 of the ICCPR.75 As noted above, security of person “concerns freedom from injury to the . . . the mind . . . and mental integrity,”76 and applies to all persons, with the Human Rights  contemplated by high-ranking U.N. officials, and because the U.S. government largely considers voluntary service in the armed forces in the public service, see generally supra notes 30-33, Article 25(c) of the ICCPR should not be dismissed as irrelevant to the present analysis.  66.

The additional harm that this ban imposes violates international obligations under the ICCPR. Furthermore, the rights to freedom of self-expression,80 and equal access to public service,81 are infringed upon by the discriminatory impact of the transgender service ban.82 The transgender service ban restricts a class of persons from freely expressing their own identities, so long as they want to retain equal access to the opportunity to serve their country in the armed forces. The military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which banned openly gay individuals from serving in the military, had similar ramifications for freedom of expression.83 Persons may choose to hide their gender identity in order to enlist in the armed services, but would do so at the expense of their rights to freely express themselves, particularly their right to freedom of expression concerning their own affairs.84 Further, the transgender service ban explicitly prohibits a class of individuals from performing a type of public service which is necessary to the adequate functioning of American society.85 Prohibiting transgender individuals from enlisting in the military, regardless of the rationale behind the ban, directly contravenes these legal obligations imposed on the United States by the ICCPR.     77.

Yet the moment service members “told,” or made statements that remotely suggested they might be gay or lesbian, under “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the military had grounds to investigate and discharge them for being homosexual or participating in homosexual sex.”) Similarly, the transgender service ban would—at least—conceivably allow individuals who don’t reveal their sex non-conforming gender identities prior to enlisting in the armed forces, to serve.  84.

The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading  Treatment or Punishment The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment [CAT] prohibits “any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person . . . for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official.”86 In addition, Article 2 of the covenant prohibits “a threat of war,” or any other “exceptional circumstances” from being used “as a justification of torture.”87 Nor may “[a]n order from a superior officer or a public authority . . . be invoked as a justification for torture.”88 Importantly, Article 16 of CAT proscribes “treatment or punishment which do[es] not amount to torture as defined in Article  1, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.”89 Upon ratification, the United States government filed with the United Nations, an important series of limiting reservations to CAT’s provisions. Specifically, the United States reserved consent to be bound by the CAT Article 16 prohibitions against acts that would constitute “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,” only insofar as such treatment would be prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.90 Several CAT State Parties objected to this reservation,91 with one even arguing that it is “incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention.”92 As established by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a reservation made by a State in adopting a treaty is invalid if, among other reasons, it “is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.”93 However, absent a notable concern that the reservation violates the object and purpose of the treaty, and arguably a pronouncement by the International Court of Justice [ICJ] that the reservation is incompatible,94 under the Vienna Convention, an objection to a reservation has the   86.

Recently, CAT’s treaty monitoring body, the Committee Against Torture, began to recognize laws that impose “preconditions to legal gender recognition” as concerning, considering obligations arising under CAT.96 Commentators have noted that the Committee’s recommendations on the applicability of CAT protections to laws that discriminate against and harm the transgender community, “may have wider implications for human rights litigation . . . [because] the right to be free from torture is more absolute in nature, provides more protection because there is less room for balancing against public interest, and is more universally recognised and applicable.”97 These recommendations were made in the Committee’s concluding observations on China’s fifth periodic report, adopted in 2016.98 Specifically, the recommendations call upon China to “[t]ake the necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to guarantee respect for the autonomy and physical and personal integrity of . . . transgender and intersex persons,” particularly in the context of forced conversion therapy, and other “abusive treatment.”99 The limited scope of the committee’s recommendations might caution against an advocacy strategy focused exclusively on engaging U.N. bodies concerned with the implementation of international norms around the prohibition against torture. It may be prudent, however, to call for expanding the scope of CAT protections to include prohibitions on state sanctioned discriminatory actions that have the effect of producing severe psychological harm similar to that experienced by members of the transgender community as a result of both state-sanctioned and private discrimination. Such an amendment may be timely given the pushback challenges to transgender discrimination face in domestic U.S. courts. The transgender service ban—at least—implicates CAT prohibitions on “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment” contained in Articles 1 and 16 of the Convention. As noted above in the discussion of ICCPR prohibitions on torture, discrimination has a profound effect on the mental health and social functioning  Reservations to Treaties: An Introduction, 24 EUROPEAN J.

While the reservations to CAT filed by the United States at the time of ratification no doubt complicate matters, under an inclusive advocacy strategy,103 the CAT, and recent developments around the Convention’s applicability to discrimination against members of the transgender community, has a role to play in challenging the transgender service ban. 3. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [ICESCR] imposes positive obligations104 on State Parties to fulfil the myriad rights guaranteed in the Covenant, including the right to work,105 “safe and healthy working conditions,”106 “the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,”107 and imposes on State Parties the obligation “to guarantee that the rights enunciated in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to . . . sex . . . or other status.”108 ICESCR also contains an independent clause obligating that states “undertake to ensure . . . the equal right of men and women [to] the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural [ESC] rights set forth in” ICESCR.109 The Committee on ESC Rights interprets ICESCR’s non-discrimination provision to protect against discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and notes that transgender persons “often face serious human rights violations, such as harassment in schools or in the workplace.”110 The Committee takes a strong stance on the conceptual difference between sex and gender in its General Comment number 16, concerning the Article 3 obligation to ensure equality between men and women in the enjoyment of ESC rights.111    100.

State parties . . . have an obligation to combat homophobia and transphobia, which lead to discrimination, including violation of the right to sexual and reproductive health.114  State sanctioned discrimination on the basis of transgender status, in employment and healthcare, clearly violates State Party obligations under ICESCR. However, the United States has not ratified ICESCR, and has only signed the Convention. Thus, an additional interpretive step is required to determine the object and purpose of the Convention and the resulting obligations of signatory parties. Scholars have noted that determining the object and purpose of a treaty is a complicated task, which often results in significant disagreement among States parties.115 Further complicating the analysis, determining a treaty’s object and purpose requires an understanding of the term “object and purpose” as utilized in international law.116 Despite the circularity of the framework used to determine a treaty’s object and purpose, doing so is critical, especially because holding powerful State signatories (such as the United States) accountable for human      112.

Typically, ICESCR’s object and purpose is interpreted, at a minimum, to include fulfillment of “core obligations”117 and ensuring the “progressive realization” of economic, social, and cultural rights.118 The Committee on ESC Rights’ has indicated that States parties to the Convention are bound under the treaty to ensure fulfillment of ICESCR’s core obligations.119 The text of the Convention provides, however, that States parties must ensure the progressive realization of ICESCR obligations.120 Regardless of what these competing understandings mean for States bound to not take action violative of ICESCR’s object and purpose, at a minimum, States parties bound by signatory obligations would be obligated to avoid taking affirmative action to bar equal access to ESC rights for a discrete group protected under ICESCR. The transgender service ban is a violation of the United States’ obligations as an ICESCR signatory party. Under international law, signatory State parties to ICESCR have the obligation to not take action that would “defeat”121 ICESCR’s object and purpose. The transgender service ban constitutes state action that defeats any iteration of ICESCR’s object and purpose. The ban is intended to arbitrarily prevent members of a marginalized group, who are protected by ICESCR’s non-discrimination provision, from accessing employment and healthcare—two rights unequivocally guaranteed by ICESCR—because of their membership in that group. Military service is employment.122 Additionally, active duty military personnel, and U.S. veterans are typically eligible to receive fairly comprehensive healthcare benefits.123 The transgender service ban not only restricts access to “freely chosen” employment opportunities, but more importantly, unfairly deprives transgender persons of access to an entire career path.124 Additionally, the stated rationale for the ban explicitly revolves around the cost of providing adequate healthcare to transgender persons.125 Such a rationale and rule deprive transgender persons of access to adequate healthcare, in further violation of ICESCR obligations.126 Ultimately, whether the object or purpose of   117.

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women [CEDAW] mandates States parties to the convention “condemn all forms of discrimination against women”129—defined as— any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women . . . on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.130 CEDAW obligates States parties “[t]o take all appropriate measures, including legislation,” to eliminate discrimination against women,131 and “ensure the full development and advancement of women, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men.”132 Additionally, States parties are obliged to take measures “[t]o modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotypes roles for men and women.”133 Despite CEDAW’s apparent focus on sex discrimination, CEDAW’s TMB, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, has interpreted CEDAW’s provisions to cover gender-based discrimination as well.134 The Committee, while noting that “[i]ntersectionality is a basic concept for understanding the scope of general obligations of States parties,” concluded that discrimination against women arises from a multiplicity of identity factors, including, inter alia, gender identity.135 As a result, States parties to CEDAW have the obligation to take measures to eliminate intersectional discrimination against women,136   127.

Scholars has noted that “CEDAW’s object and purpose is likely twofold: the ‘elimination of all forms of discrimination against women’ and gender equality.”139 Assuming based upon CEDAW’s language, and interpretations of the Convention’s text by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, that CEDAW’s purpose expands beyond mere protection of women against discrimination on the basis of sex, and extends to protecting women—including women who experience intersectional discrimination because of their gender identities—from gender and sex non-conforming gender identity based discrimination, the transgender service ban would clearly erode the object and purpose of CEDAW, in violation of the United States’ commitments under the Convention as a signing party. Even assuming a limited construction of CEDAW’s object and purpose—one that does not stretch the Convention to include among its recognized forms of prohibited discrimination, discrimination against members of the transgender community,140 generally—the transgender service ban still has the effect of discriminating against women who identify as transgender. In theory, application of the transgender service ban to individuals who identify as women, but were assigned male sex at birth (meaning their gender is female), and individuals who identify as men, but were assigned the female sex at birth and have not had sex reassignment surgery violates CEDAW’s object and purpose. As discussed above in relation to the United States’ commitments under ICESCR,141 any affirmative state action mandating discrimination against women because of their sexual or gender identities as women, in light of the object and purpose of the Convention, would necessarily violate a signing party’s obligation to refrain from taking action that would violate the object and purpose of the Convention.  This is true regardless of whether the object and purpose is defined comprehensively or narrowly. The transgender service ban is clearly an affirmative government act, which discriminates against a group of persons, within which women are included—namely women who identify as transgender (regardless of their biological sex). Therefore, it violates the United States’ commitments as a signatory party to CEDAW.  In addition, the transgender service ban is arguably rooted in stereotyped reasoning about the ways in which men and women should behave—or, gender stereotypes.142 “By excluding an entire category of people on this characteristic   137.

As a result, a comprehensive human rights based advocacy strategy should incorporate CEDAW principles and examine potential advocacy channels, available as a result of CEDAW. III. A COMPREHENSIVE ADVOCACY STRATEGY TARGETING THE                  TRANSGENDER SERVICE BAN Given the limitations of an advocacy strategy focused exclusively on domestic litigation146 and legislative change,147 advocacy challenging the transgender service ban, and other forms of discrimination against the transgender community, should incorporate applicable international human rights law instruments and doctrine, as well as efforts directed at international human rights fora, including relevant treaty monitoring bodies. First, utilizing an international human rights law framework renders accessible additional fora through which advocacy may be directed. Most importantly among these fora are two of the relevant treaty monitoring bodies discussed above, and specifically the Human Rights Committee. While the United States has not consented to have individual complaints brought against it in these bodies,148 the U.S. is obliged to comply with monitoring requirements, which include taking part in periodic compliance assessments.149 In part, the purpose of “the reporting process [is to] create[] a basis for constructive dialogue between States and treaty bodies . . . in fostering effective national implementation of the international human rights instruments.”150 The reporting process is also designed to provide States with opportunities to review their compliance with human rights treaties, and to “facilitate, at the national level, public scrutiny of government policies and constructive engagement with relevant actors of civil society.”151    143.

CSOs make their most significant contribution to the review process through the submission of “shadow reports,” which augment and contextualize the United States’ formal reports by detailing areas where the United States allegedly has failed to meet its Convention obligations, shedding light on “what is actually happening on a daily basis to communities of color across the U.S.” 153 The United States is due to complete its fourth periodic review under the ICCPR in 2019.154 This is particularly important given the timing of U.S. political cycles, and the anticipated Presidential election in 2020. Completed reports by civil society organizations and findings by the Human Rights Committee addressing human rights non-compliance in the United States may encourage officials to adopt policies aimed at complying with human rights obligations. In particular, given the relatively high publicity the transgender service ban received,155 explicitly linking the ban to non-compliance with international obligations may galvanize efforts challenging the Executive Order, and other forms of state sanctioned discrimination against the transgender community. Besides advocacy focused on highlighting treaty obligations and non-compliance in treaty monitoring bodies, applying the international human rights law framework to the transgender service ban has the potential to provide United Nations’ special procedures mandate holders with a framework for addressing how the transgender service ban violates international obligations, and how it relates to more wide-spread discrimination against the transgender community.156 Special procedures “are independent human rights experts with mandates to report and advise on human rights from a thematic or country-specific perspective.”157 Simply calling the transgender service ban a violation of international law, and demonstrating how the ban implicates international obligations, may attract attention to the more widespread attacks on transgender   152.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, by utilizing an international human rights framework, advocates provide victims of discrimination with additional opportunities for their voices to be heard and to participate in efforts challenging the victimization they experience.159 As a central tenant of the human rights framework, participation ensures that “[p]eople have a right to participate in how decisions are made regarding protection of their rights.”160 For groups experiencing discrimination at the hands of their governments, including the transgender community in the United States, participation guarantees that marginalized groups are provided with a platform for challenging discrimination they face, and provides members of the group with a voice to impact changes in policies effecting them.161 Therefore, utilizing the international human rights law framework to challenge transgender discrimination provides victims of human rights violations with an additional benefit, through enabling them to participate in advocacy and decision-making concerning the rights violations they experience. IV. CONCLUSION The international human rights law framework provides advocates challenging the Trump administration’s discriminatory policies with additional tools, particularly the core human rights treaties, as well as additional fora, including most importantly the Human Rights Committee, through which advocacy may be directed. These additional opportunities for challenging the ban—or challenging broader discrimination faced by the transgender community using the transgender service ban as an example of the kind of discrimination faced by members of the transgender community—are of particular importance considering the unfavorable state of U.S. law as related to transgender rights, and U.S. legislative capacity to undo executive action. Additionally, the international human rights law framework encourages participation in advocacy efforts by victims of rights violations. Therefore, by challenging transgender discrimination under the international human rights law framework, victims of gender identity discrimination will be empowered to direct advocacy against policies threatening their abilities to equally participate in society. While potential gains under the human rights framework may be modest and indirect, using human rights law as a complement to domestic U.S. advocacy strategies challenging transgender     158.
