Furthermore, those \nwithin that community who identify as non-binary and not on either side of the spectrum of \ngender, face a unique set of issues with regards to preferred pronoun usage by peers. A general \nsurvey was distributed across campus to gage familiarity with the LGBTQIAP+ community. \nInterviews were conducted both to document experiences with using preferred pronouns in \nacademic and social settings as well as gather suggestions for the details of an LGBTQIAP+ \nresource center. From the data collected in these interviews, a gender neutral pronoun training \nwas written and a proposal for an LGBTQIAP+ resource center was drafted. A focus group \nsession was held to determine the expectations and effectiveness of the aforementioned \npronoun training. Based on all of the information gathered, a recommendation was made to \nthe Safe Zone Committee to add the pronoun training to their selection of modules. Another \nrecommendation was made to the administration of WPI to review the written resource center \nproposal and use it as a guideline when constructing the space. The work done this project will \nserve not only to provide valuable data about the experience of the LGBTQIAP+ community on \nthis campus but also improve the quality of life here for those within that community.  \n iv \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nIt is imperative that we take the time to that all of the miraculous individuals who \ncontributed their efforts to making this project a success. Without their help it wouldn’t have \nbeen nearly as possible to impact our campus in such a meaningful way. We would like to \nexpress our gratitude to our sponsor, the Office of Multicultural Affairs and more specifically \nour closest OMA contact, Julia Sorcinelli. She attended nearly every single one of your progress \nupdate meetings and shared resources with us that were invaluable to the creation of the \nLGBTQIAP+ resource center and pronoun training. We would like to also acknowledge the \nsupport of the project by the members of the Safe Zone committee and their contributions.  \nThank you to WPI facilities meeting with us and discussing the issue of free space on campus as \nwell as offering suggestions in drafting the LGBTQIAP+ resource center proposal. Special thanks \nto Fred DiMauro and James Bedard for your offering all of the knowledge of    campus that you \nhad. \nWe especially appreciate the exuberance of diversity chair Michelle Jones-Johnson in \nour project and for taking the time to attend one of our meetings to learn more about what we \nwere doing. We thank her for continuing to be a champion of acceptance and understanding at \nWorcester Polytechnic Institute. \nFinally, we would like to thank our project advisor professor Adrienne Hall-Phillips. Her \nguidance throughout the duration of this project has been incredible and given us tools to take \nwith us in our future academic endeavors. She gave us the freedom to investigate the topics we \nwere passionate about and her comments were always constructive and ultimately helped \nproduce a project that we can all be proud of. \n \n  \n v \nAUTHORSHIP \nLeo Bunyea: Leo served as the lead for all research pertaining to the drafting of the resource \ncenter proposal.

In order to create a more inclusive atmosphere for these students, WPI needs \nto update some of its practices. Currently, there is no physical space at WPI where LGBTQIAP+ \nstudents can go to feel safe or to get access to vital resources. Furthermore, students who \nidentify as non-binary, falling in between the two stereotypical gender binaries, face particular \nadversity in the classroom and across campus. Some staff and faculty are ill-educated on the \nsubject of gender neutrality and identity and accidentally misgender students by referring to \nthem with some incorrect pronouns. In order to make WPI a more welcoming institution for the \naforementioned community, this project tackles two major goals: 1) develop and implement a \nPronoun Awareness Training for staff and faculty, and 2) develop a detailed proposal for an \nLGBTQIAP+ resource center for the WPI campus. A pronoun awareness training will serve the \npurpose of normalizing gender neutral language and, therefore, ease the plight of these \ntransgender students. Giving WPI as an institution a complete and thorough proposal for an \nLGBTQIAP+ resource center would incentivize the creation of such a space and ensure that its \ncontents and design are appropriate for those that would find solace there.  \n \nPronoun Awareness Training \nMethods \nFirst, a series of interviews were conducted to gage student experience with preferred \npronoun usage on campus. After this, a first draft of the training was written in an interactive \nstyle and designed to be forty-five minutes to an hour long. It consisted of a power point \npresentation lead by a trained speaker, engaging activities among the participants and a helpful \nworksheet for the participants to refer to and utilize after the training is completed. This \nversion of the training was then administered to a focus group that is active in the LGBTQIAP+ \ncommunity. A survey was given to them before and after the training to determine Its \neffectiveness and obtain feedback. Based on the combined results of those two surveys, the \n x \ntraining was revised and then deemed acceptable to be administered to the WPI community. \nThe training was administered to willing participants of WPI’s campus and then given to the \nSafe Zone Committee to maintain as a living document and selectable module. \nResults and Recommendations \n We found several interesting things during the process of our interviews and focus \ngroups. The first of which was that students who used she/her or he/him pronouns had far less \ndifficulty in asking other members of the community to use their preferred pronouns. Similarly \nthose that were interviewed and used they/them pronouns felt unwelcome on campus. To \naddress this issue and make these students feel more comfortable in this campus environment, \nwe recommend administering training to as much of the WPI community as possible. This will \nprovide these students visibility and grant their identity validity in the mind of those less \neducated in this area. Our focus groups mainly raised the concern of addressing “it” as an \nunacceptable pronoun when referring to a human being. To fix this, “the use of it as a pronoun” \nhas been added to the final version of the training. Something else that they voiced was that \nsitting through an hour of this training may not affect the trainee’s behavior. However, they did \nunderstand that this training was simply meant to be a stepping stone into the world of gender \nidentity and respect for the participants.  \nLGBTQIAP+ Resource Center \nMethods \nFor the purpose of creating the LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center, the campus was polled on \ntheir general knowledge of and affiliation with the LGBTQIAP+ community. Through getting this \ndata from students, a statistic for those who may benefit from the resource center can be \nacquired. Garnering the opinions of the student body, staff and faculty is a very important \nfactor for the creation of this Resource Center, so a series of interviews were conducted to find \nout what resources they thought this center should house, how it should be staffed what type \nof space it should inhabit, and what they already knew about resources available to the \nLGBTQIAP+ community. After taking those viewpoints into account and determining what is \nneeded, a proposal for the center was drafted, detailing the cost of the contents and upkeep, \nthe necessary furniture, and what kind of staff must be available. \n xi \nResults and Recommendations \nThe Resource Center Interviews provided a number of perspectives on the campus \nclimate around the LGBTQIAP+ community. One of the most important deductions from them \nwas that every single person who was interviewed said that this was a place that they would \nfeel comfortable visiting whether they identified within the community or not and also that the \ncenter should span at least across an entire floor. The majority of participants felt that this \ncenter was the best way for WPI to provide for its LGBTQIAP+ community. In addition to this, \nnot one participant could name the full range of resources available to WPI’s LGBTQIAP+ \npopulation. We recommend that WPI follow the proposal that was drafted with these data \npoints in mind when seeking to construct or establish this center. It would be a central location \nthat everyone has access to so everyone within this community would be able to advocate \nproperly for themselves and find a relevant support network. \n  \n xii \nKEY TERMS \n● LGBTQIAP+ - One of the many acronyms used to refer to the community of individuals \nwho are not heterosexual and/or cisgender. This one stands for “Lesbian, \nGay/Genderqueer/Genderfluid, Bisexual/Biromantic/Bigender, Transgender, \nQueer/Questioning, Intersex, Asexual/Aromantic/Agender, and \nPansexual/Panromantic/Pangender”. The acronym grows every day. \n● Lesbian - An individual who identifies as a woman who is sexually and/or \nromantically attracted to other women \n● Gay - Generally refers to individuals who are sexually and/or romantically \nattracted to individuals of the same gender. This term is often used specifically \nto mean male-identified individuals who are attracted to men, but is sometimes \nalso used to refer to the entire LGBTQIAP+ community (e.g. Gay rights) \n● Bisexual - An individual who is sexually and/or romantically attracted to \nindividuals of two or more genders \n● Bigender - An individual who identifies with two or more gender identities \n● Transgender - An individual whose gender identity does not match the one \nassigned to them at birth \n● Queer - This is used as an umbrella term to describe individuals who identify as \nnon-straight. It is also used to describe people who have nonconforming gender \nidentity. Due to its historical use as a derogatory term, it is not embraced or used \nby all members of the LGBTQ+ community. The term queer can also be used \ninterchangeably with LGBTQIAP+ \n● Questioning - An individual who is unsure about or is exploring their orientation \nor gender identity \n● Intersex - A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is \nborn with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical \ndefinitions of female or male. There are therefore many third biological sexes, \noutside the binary of male and female. \n xiii \n● Asexual - An individual who does not typically experience sexual attraction. \n● Aromantic - an individual who does not typically experience romantic attraction \n● Agender - an individual who does not identify with any gender \n● Pansexual - An individual who is sexually attracted to individuals of more than \ntwo or all genders. Sometimes, this term is used interchangeably with bisexual, \nthe correctness of which is still being disputed. Please defer to how the \nindividual chooses to identify themselves. \n● Gender - The label given to one’s internal sense of self in relation to the social \nconstructs of masculinity, femininity and androgyny \n● Cisgender - Term that refers to an individual who identifies with the gender they were \nassigned at birth \n● Sexual Orientation - The sexual attraction one feels for others, often labeled based on \nthe gender relationship between the individual and the people they are attracted to \n● Sex - The classification of people as male or female or intersex, typically assigned at \nbirth based on the appearance of external anatomy \n● Non-Binary - An individual whose gender identity does not fit within the binary of male \nand female. This can be an umbrella term for many non-binary genders, such as \nandrogyne, agender, bigender, genderfluid, and genderqueer. \n● Gender-Non-Conforming - An individual whose gender identity does not conform to any \nsocietal notions of gender. Sometimes used to mean non-binary. \n \n 1 \nINTRODUCTION \nGender is the label given to one’s internal sense of self in relation to the social \nconstructs of masculinity, femininity or the lack thereof. Contrary to popular belief, this is not \nlimited nor defined by any of the sexes to which people are assigned at birth: male, female or \nany of the forms of intersex. Sex is assigned at birth based on the appearance of genitalia on \nthe infant. Generally, an infant with a penis will be assigned male and one with a vagina will be \nassigned female. In the case of intersex, doctors will often recommend surgeries to alter \ncombined configurations of genitalia so as to fit the prescribed male-female binary. Biologically, \nsex is defined by the chromosomes which carry the genes for various sex characteristics (breast \ntissue, genitals, hormones, etc), the sex chromosomes X and Y. Generally, females have two X \nchromosomes and males have one X and one Y. Intersex people may have extra sex \nchromosome(s) or missing a sex chromosome or some other condition that results in an \nuncommon configuration of sex characteristics. \nIn many Western cultures, there exists a binary gender system: male and female. Each \ngender is associated with a set of gender roles, a prescribed set of behaviors and  societal roles \na person of a certain gender is expected to fulfill. For example, in most Western cultures, \nwomen are expected to be docile and submissive to the men who are allowed to be aggressive \nand authoritative. These roles can be best observed in the Western idealization of a nuclear \nfamily. The mother stays home to take care of the children while the father works, and the \nfather is not expected to contribute as much to child-rearing and earns money for the family. \nThis phenomenon can be linked to the fact that XX people are biologically equipped to carry \nand bear children and nurse. The assumption followed that XX people are to be child rearers \nwhile the XY people provide for them. This system evolved into what is known today as the \ngender binary system of Western society. These roles associated with the two most common \nsexes grow into Western gender roles. Thus, each sex became strongly associated with a \ncorresponding gender: XX people are women and XY people are men. \nIndividuals who do not identify with the gender to which they were assigned at birth are \nconsidered transgender or gender-non-conforming. Some of these individuals may then choose \n 2 \nto physically “transition” into this gender. They may undergo hormone replacement therapy, \ngenital reassignment surgery and other procedures. Many transgender and gender-non-\nconforming people feel this is necessary to be accepted as their chosen gender, as sex \ncharacteristics and gender roles are tied so tightly to gender. Some transgender and gender-\nnon-conforming people may choose not to undergo any sort of transition as they feel that their \ngender is not dependant upon their physical or hormonal characteristics. Gender, while \nstrongly tied to sex, is not entirely dependant upon it.  \nHowever, the concept of gender and sex being independent is not widely accepted. This \nis the result of years of creating the social constructs of femininity and masculinity, the notion \nof being able to determine someone else’s gender based only on appearance and traits that \ncoincide with these social constructs. As a result of this misgendering, many transgender or \ngender-non-conforming individuals are put into an uncomfortable environment where they are \nperceived one way, but identify differently. Due to the largely cisgender population, many \npeople feel pressured to conform to the genders that other people assign to them rather than \nwhat they identify as out of fear of discrimination. \n It is widely believed that 4-10% of the world’s population identifies as LGBTQIAP+. \nLGBTQIAP+ youth are 8.4 times more likely to have reported attempting suicide and 5.9 times \nmore likely to report severe depression in comparison to their non-LGBTQIAP+ identifying \npeers. Approximately a fifth of students are physically assaulted because of their sexual \norientation and over a tenth because of their gender expression. Two thirds of LGBTQIAP+ \nstudents reported being sexually harassed in school during the past year (Syracuse University, \n2016). In their lifetime, 42.8% of transgender individuals are diagnosed with depression (The \nAlliance, 2016). \n LGBTQIAP+ students at college are at risk of being a victim of prejudice and ignorance. \nSomeone who is prejudiced against any part of the LGBTQIAP+ community will react negatively \nto their lifestyle which may manifest itself in violent acts, whether they be verbal or physical. \nThose who are uneducated about the LGBTQIAP+ community may unintentionally say \nsomething hurtful or offensive and make LGBTQIAP+ students uncomfortable. They also may \nwant to learn more, but ask inappropriate questions that are also unwelcomed by the student \n 3 \nin question. Transgender individuals tend to be the subject of this aggression in most cases. But \non top of ignorance and prejudice, there is the constant fear that they will not “pass” as the \ngender (or lack thereof) that they identify with. Many transgender people also suffer from \ngender dysphoria which is a crippling condition that amplifies the discrepancies between the \ngender you identify with the and stereotypical biological sex that is associated with that gender. \nTransgender students are constantly conscious of their gender presentation and actions in \nsocial situations for fear of being misgendered through pronoun usage (Miller & James, 2009; \nAmherst College, 2016). \nWorcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is no longer an all white, cisgender male \nengineering college. Since its founding in 1865 it has extended its acceptance to women, all \ntypes of racial minorities, people of varying sexual orientations and individuals anywhere in the \ngender spectrum. Students identifying as a member of the LGBTQIAP+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, intersex, queer or questioning, asexual or aromantic) community are a sizeable \nportion of WPI’s population in comparison to other colleges in the United States. To position \nitself as a campus for all students, we believe, WPI needs to update some of its practices in \norder to create a more inclusive atmosphere for those students on campus. Currently, WPI’s \nmain support system for LGBTQIAP+ students on campus is the Safe Zone Committee, which is \nconnected to the WPI Office of Multicultural Affairs. However, there is no physical space at WPI \nwhere LGBTQIAP+ students can go to feel safe or to get access to helpful resources. \nFurthermore, students who identify as transgender and fall in between the two stereotypical \ngender binaries face particular adversity in the classroom and across campus. Some staff and \nfaculty are ill-educated on the subject of gender neutrality and accidentally misgender students \nby using the incorrect pronouns when referring to that individual. In order to make WPI a more \nwelcoming institution for LGBTQIAP+ people, this project will tackle two major goals: 1) develop \nand implement a Pronoun Awareness Training for staff and faculty, and 2) develop a detailed \nproposal for an LGBTQIAP+ resource center for the WPI campus. A pronoun awareness training \nwill serve the purpose of normalizing gender neutral language and, therefore, ease the plight of \nthese transgender students. Giving WPI as an institution a complete and thorough proposal for \nan LGBTQIAP+ resource center would incentivize the creation of such a space and ensure that \n 4 \nits contents and design are appropriate. After its completion there would be a designated space \nfor students, staff and faculty to get access to the resources and services that they deserve. \nWith these goals in mind, this project hopes to introduce more individuals to gender neutral \npronouns and also give WPI the tools it needs to build or convert a safe space into an \nLGBTQIAP+ resource center.  \nThis IQP report is organized in the following way. First we will review background on \nmisgendering and gender expression, pronoun history and modern usage, pronoun awareness \ntrainings and LGBTQIAP+ at WPI. Next we will layout the methodology for the pronoun \nawareness training and the LGBTQIAP+ resource center separately. After this will be the \ndepiction of the results of the results of the surveys, interviews and focus groups that we \nconducted. Following this section is the discussion which includes our data analysis and \nrecommendations going forward. The final section is the conclusion which will summarize the \nentirety of the project and speak more directly to our deliverables. The pronoun training, \nresource center proposal, focus group surveys, and interview transcriptions can all be found in \nthe appendix. \n \nBACKGROUND \nIt is important to establish a solid foundation of knowledge in the realm of gender \nidentity and pronoun usage. With this clearer understanding of the topic, one can begin to see \nthe benefits that would be offered by what this project is proposing. This section will provide an \nanalysis of gender identity, preferred pronouns and their history and usage, current pronoun \ntrainings and how they all relate at this institution. \nGender: Misgendering and Expression \nIn modern society, there are stereotypical expectations of gender expression and the \npronouns associated with either feminine or masculine expression or biological body parts. Due \nto this preconceived notion of “feminine” or “masculine” body types, preferred pronouns are \ngenerally assumed. When an individual is referred to with pronouns that don’t match their \n 5 \npreferred pronouns, it is called ‘misgendering’. Misgendering is harmful because it negates the \nability of self-expression and disrespects the identity of the target, intentional or unintentional \n(Kapusta, 2016). Misgendering is far more frequent for people that identify in between the \n“traditional” gender binary. This is because neo pronouns are unfamiliar to many older \ngenerations. In a classroom setting, students who identify on the non-binary spectrum run the \nrisk of being misgendered by a professor or a peer. This deeply hinders the capacity for learning \nof a transgender student who feels targeted and invalidated. The most effective academic \nenvironment is one which supports and embraces diversity in order to make students of any \nkind feel comfortable and safe (Wilson, 2016). \nPronouns: History and Modern Usage \nPronouns possess a great deal of emotional value for those identifying outside of the \ngender binary. However, speaking from technicality, a pronoun is a word which is used in place \nof a noun or noun phrase. Personal pronouns refer to a grammatical person: the first person \n(the speaker), the second person (the addressee) or the third person (others). Pronouns are \nused in place of a person’s name. They are used to avoid superfluous language caused by using \na proper noun multiple times in a sentence. They are also used when the name of a person is \nunknown. \nCurrently, there are four linguistically accepted English language third person singular \npronouns: he/him/his/his/himself (masculine), she/her/her/hers/herself (feminine), \nit/it/its/its/itself (neuter) and they/them/their/theirs/themself (epicene, or without gender). \nWhen we refer to someone other than us or the person we are speaking to, we generally \nchoose one of these pronouns. In the American education system, students are taught that, \nwhen the gender of the third person is unknown to the speaker, they should use “he or she” \ninstead of the epicene, singular “they”. Formal and legal writing use generic “he” in place of “he \nor she”. The use of the generic “he” has been found to be harmful and to fuel sexist tendencies \nin the male dominated society of the Western world. For example, in the Canadian Supreme \nCourt Case Edwards v Canada, the use of the generic “he” in Canadian legal documents was \ncalled into question. It was unclear whether or not women were allowed to serve on the \nCanadian Senate. The ruling stated that members of the male and female sex can serve on the \n 6 \nCanadian Senate, interpreting the “he” pronouns throughout the documents to be the generic \nuse (Edwards v. Canada, 1929). More commonplace examples include phrases such as “A \ndoctor should not harm his patient,” reinforces the idea of men being doctors and women not \nbeing skilled enough to become doctors (Miller & James, 2009). Despite these well-known \nadverse effects of generic “he”, the use of epicene, singular “they” is looked down upon by \nintellectual communities as uneducated. \nPreferred pronouns are defined as a set of third person pronouns with which an \nindividual prefers to be referred to. Pronouns do not inherently have a gender outside of their \nlinguistic gender. They are not inherently connected to particular one particular gender \nidentity. For example, an individual may identify as a woman but prefers to be referred to with \nthey/them/their/theirs/themself pronouns. However, there are pronouns commonly associated \nwith certain genders (e.g. he/him for men, they/them for agender people). \nDue to the fact that epicene, singular “they” is not yet widely accepted, individuals \nwhose genders fall outside of the binary of “man or woman” will sometimes choose a neo-\npronoun as their preferred pronoun. Neo-pronouns are often doctored versions of existing \nEnglish pronouns or borrowed from other languages. For example, the Elverson neo-pronouns \nfrom 1975, ey/em/eir/eirs/emself were formed by removing the “th-“ from they/them plural \npronouns. These are used in science fiction novels and preferred by a number of non-binary or \ngender-nonconforming individuals. Another set of neo-pronouns are borrowed from the \nGerman language and is conjugated ze/hir/hir/hirs/hirself. These pronouns were widely \npreferred by non-binary and gender-nonconforming individuals in the 1980s and 1990s \n(Bornstein & Bergman, 2010). \nPronoun Awareness Trainings \n The usage of correct preferred pronouns by others is an integral part of the comfort of a \ntransgender individual in social settings. However, it is not yet normalized to ask someone \nabout which pronouns they prefer and pronouns are often assumed based on gender \nexpression. Therefore, to introduce the uninformed to the concept of pronoun preference and \nthe LGBTQIAP+ community in general thousands of trainings have been created. \n 7 \nLGBTQIAP+ Awareness Trainings are administered by a number of companies and \neducational institutions. Typically, these trainings are delivered in a lecture format \naccompanied by a PowerPoint (Shlasko, 2016). In some instances a worksheet is provided to \ncomplete alongside the presentation. These workshops briefly include a section about \ntransgender individuals who identify as non-binary and use unfamiliar pronouns. Syracuse \nUniversity has a three hour training entitled “Safer People, Safer Spaces” that falls under this \ncategory (WPI, 2016b). There are also programs specifically geared towards preferred gender \npronouns such as the “Think Again Training” that can be performed by a knowledgeable \nspeaker hired from the organization (Shlasko, 2016). Currently, WPI has its own LGBTQIAP+ \nAwareness Training that is three hours long and educates attendees on most topics of the \nLGBTQIAP+ discussion. It is incentivized by the Safe Zone Committee placing a special “Safe \nZone” indicator on the door of a participating professor to show students who identify under \nthat spectrum that they can confide within that person. It does contain a section on preferred \ngender pronouns, however, the participants of the training are not actually required to use or \nfurther familiarize themselves with them. WPI needs a training specifically for preferred gender \npronoun education so that students, staff and faculty are comfortable with using non-binary \ninclusive terminology in an academic setting (Wilson, 2016).  \nLGBTQIAP+ at WPI \nCurrently, WPI does have several resources and social groups available for LGBTQIAP+ \nstudents to utilize or participate in. There is the student-operated organization called The \nAlliance, who provides educational, social and advocacy outlets through various event \nsurrounding the Day of Silence, World AIDS Day, National Coming Out Day and many others \n(The Alliance, 2016). WPI also has a faculty/staff-run organization called the Safe Zone \nCommittee. The Safe Zone Committee, as discussed above, acts as resources for members of \nthe campus community who have questions or concerns related to LGBTQIAP+ issues. \n(Worcester Polytechnic Institute [WPI], 2016b). Even WPI’s Career Development center has \nspecific resources for LGBTQIAP+ on how to handle their identity in the workplace (WPI, \n2016a). \n 8 \n To provide additional support to LGBTQIAP+ individuals, WPI could benefit from having \na dedicated LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center. Other campuses, such as Amherst College and Cornell \nUniversity have such facilities, and offer services such as a counseling center, free coffee, a \nlibrary containing information on queer history, Queer/Trans 101 and Advanced Training, and a \ndedicated staff willing to create a safer space on campus (Amherst College, 2016; Cornell, \n2016). Additionally, these centers also provide information and resources that assist with the \nprocedures of Legal Name Change, and Gender Marker Changes on Identity Documents. \nThrough these services, students who otherwise feel uncomfortable living on campus can be \nprovided support from staff to give them a sense of belonging. WPI could benefit from the \nexistence of such a center, to aid its increasing population of individuals on campus who \nidentify as LGBTQIAP+ in order to give them a location where no matter what, they may feel \ncomfortable. Given WPI’s history of formerly being an all white male school, adding this facility \nmay help WPI in its transformation into a more safe and inclusive place for students of all \nsexualities and genders. WPI already has groups such as The Alliance dedicated to helping out \nLGBTQIAP+ individuals who host campus events such as Trans Day of Remembrance and \nComing Out Day, and having this Resource Center as a dedicated space for these events to be \nhosted would be highly beneficial. In addition, having resources for educating individuals on \nLGBTQIAP+ information would help spread awareness to those who may be uninformed of any \nissues facing LGBTQIAP+ peoples. Through the distribution of this information via the resource \ncenter, students and staff alike can avoid misunderstandings amongst each other regarding \nLGBTQIAP+ issues, such as misgendering people. With more informed people on campus, the \nlikelihood of this information being spread and passed on to incoming students increases. This \ncenter, in conjunction with the Pronoun Training can help create a campus where everyone can \nlive in harmony. \n  \n 9 \nMETHODS \nThis project’s deliverables are based on the growing diversity of WPI’s community. The \nfirst objective is to tailor a gender neutral pronoun training to the specific needs of the \nstudents, staff and faculty on this campus. The main goal of this training is not only to raise \nawareness of the existence of non-binary students on this campus but also to generate \nfamiliarity with the concept of using respectful gender neutral pronouns in everyday speech. \nThe second mission of this project is to draft a physical proposal for an LGBTQIAP+ Resource \nCenter. This center would provide resources, specific services and a safe space for WPI’s \nLGBTQIAP+ population. \n \nPronoun Awareness Training: \nFirst a series of interviews were conducted to catalog the experiences of students attempting to \nuse preferred pronouns on campus. Using this data, a first draft of the training was written in \nan interactive style and designed to be forty-five minutes to an hour long. It consisted of a \npower point presentation lead by a knowledgeable speaker, engaging activities among the \nparticipants and a helpful worksheet for the participants to refer to and utilize after the training \nis over. Then this version of the training was administered to a focus group that is familiar with \nand active in the LGBTQIAP+ community. A survey was given to them before and after the \ntraining to determine Its effectiveness and obtain feedback. Based on the combined results of \nthose two surveys, the training was revised and then considered to be acceptable to be \nadministered to the WPI community. The training was administered to willing participants of \nWPI’s campus and then given to the Safe Zone Committee to maintain as a living document and \ncontinue to utilize it. \nLGBTQIAP+ Resource Center: \nFor the purpose of creating the LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center, a general survey was distributed \nto campus with various questions asking about familiarity with the LGBTQIAP+ community. \nExamples of such questions include: “Do you identify as LGBTQIAP+?” and “Do you know \n 10 \nsomeone on the campus who identifies as LGBTQIAP+?” Through getting this data from \nstudents, a statistic for those who may benefit from the resource center can be acquired. \nAdditionally, a series of interviews was conducted to gather suggestions that students, staff and \nfaculty had for the resource center. Ideas presented were compared with facilities made \navailable at other such resource centers such as the center at Syracuse University. After \ngathering the opinions of the WPI community and determining what was needed, a proposal \nfor the Center was drafted in two parts, one fiscally realistic and the other using less financial \nlimitation. \n \nRESULTS \nResearch efforts were split into three sections based on the nature of this project’s \ndeliverables: general campus knowledge of the LGBTQIAP+ community, gender neutral \npronoun awareness, and resource center visualization. To cover the first topic, a survey was \nsent out to the WPI community to capture information that would not only highlight the level \nof education of these issues but also help establish a need for a gender neutral pronoun \ntraining and resource center. The next section was investigated with a series of interviews \nasking the participants about their experience using their preferred pronouns on campus. This \ninformation was then used to tailor a gender neutral pronoun training to the specific needs of \ngender nonconforming students at WPI. That training was given to a focus group who filled out \na questionnaire before taking it as well as after to give feedback on the effectiveness of the \ntraining and suggestions to make it better. To gauge the community’s ideas and desires for a \npotential LGBTQIAP+ resource center, interviews were conducted asking the participants \npointed questions about how they would visualize the space. \nGeneral Campus Knowledge of the LGBTQIAP+ Community \nThe survey that captured campus’ general knowledge and awareness of the LGBTQIAP+ \ncommunity was sent out to all faculty on campus as well as several student groups and \norganizations like The Alliance and the Game Developers Club via email. The survey was open \nfor approximately two and half months. The majority of people who took the survey were \n 11 \nfaculty or staff with a total of 252 responses, followed by seniors (52), sophomores (50), first-\nyears (41), juniors (30), and lastly graduate students (12), the entire survey having a total of 437 \nresponses (Figure 1). \n \n \nFigure 1: Demographic of Survey Participants \n \nThe first question that the participants were asked was, “Do you self-identify as a \nmember of the LGBTQIAP+ Community?” This question’s purpose was to attempt to estimate \njust how much of WPI’s population would be represented by this project. Of the collected \nresponses, the majority of them do not self-identify as LGBTQIAP+. Out of the 437 responses, \n103, or 23.79%, self-identified as members of the LGBTQIAP+ community (Figure 2). \n \n 12 \n \nFigure 2: Whole Sample Self-Identification \n \nThe second question that the participants were asked was, “Do you know anyone who \nself-identifies as a member of the LGBTQIAP+ community?” The responses to this question \nhelped to infer the familiarity of the WPI community with issues that affect people who self-\nidentify. 93.67% of the people who responded to this survey claimed to know someone who \nidentifies as a member of LGBTQIAP+ community (Figure 3).  \n \nFigure 3: Figure 3: Whole Sample: Do you know someone who self identifies? \n \n 13 \nFurthermore, of those who claimed to know someone who self-identifies as a member \nof the LGBTQIAP+ community, 102 also self-identified while 293 did not. None of the individuals \nwho self-identified did not also know someone else who also self-identified. On the other hand, \n28 of those who did not self-identify also did not know someone who did (Figure 4). \n \n \nFigure 4: Sample Identification Within and Without the LGBTQIAP+ Community \n \nThe third question that the participants were asked was, “Do you know anyone who \nuses pronouns other than he/him or she/her? (For example they/them or ey/em).” This \nquestion was to test the familiarity of WPI’s population with gender neutral pronouns. \nApproximately 42 Percent of respondents knew someone who used pronouns other than \nhe/him and she/her (Figure 5).  \n \n 14 \n \nFigure 5: Whole Sample: Gender Neutral Pronoun Awareness \n \nHowever, 70.18% or 155 of faculty or staff who responded to this question did not know \nanyone who used gender neutral pronouns (Figure 6). Only 38.99% or 62 members of the \nstudent body did not know anyone who used gender neutral pronouns. The most commonly \nknown other pronoun was they/them, with a total of 146 responses.  \n \n \nFigure 6: Faculty/Staff: Gender Neutral Pronoun Awareness \n \n 15 \nThe final question presented to the participants was, “Please indicate with the following \nstatement: WPI is accepting of students who self-identify as a member of the LGBTQIAP+ \ncommunity. (on a scale of 1 - 5, with 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree).” This \nquestion’s main purpose was to see how accepting each demographic who took the survey \nthought WPI’s atmosphere was towards people who identify themselves as a member of the \nLGBTQIAP+ community. 75.46% of all participants at least somewhat agree with the statement \nthat WPI is accepting of students who self-identify as members of the LGBTQIAP+ community. \nHowever, of the individuals who indicated that they self-identified 9.09% marked that they feel \nthat WPI’s campus climate is not accepting towards the LGBTQIAP+ community (Figure 7). \n \n \nFigure 7: Campus Acceptance Towards LGBTQIAP+ Community According to Those \nWho Self-Identify \n \n Of the individuals who indicated that they know others who self-identify, 6.69% marked \nthat they feel that WPI’s campus climate is not accepting towards the LGBTQIAP+ community \n(Figure 8). Of the individuals who indicated that they neither self-identify nor know others who \nself-identify 3.70%, one person, marked that they feel that WPI’s campus climate is not \naccepting towards the LGBTQIAP+ community. No one in this category marked that they \nstrongly disagreed (Figure 9).  \n \n 16 \n \nFigure 8: Campus Acceptance Towards LGBTQIAP+ Community According to Those \nWho Know Others Who Self-Identify \n \nFigure 9: Campus Acceptance Towards LGBTQIAP+ Community According to Those Do \nNot Self Identify and Do Not Know Others Who Self Identify \n \nOf the individuals who indicated that they were either a freshman or sophomore and \nself-identified as a member of the LGBTQIAP+ community, 8.57% marked that they feel that \nWPI’s campus climate is not accepting towards the LGBTQIAP+ community (Figure 10).  \nThere are several important and relevant conclusions that can be extracted from this \ndata. The first is that almost all of the individuals that were surveyed at least know one person \n 17 \nwho is a part of the LGBTQIAP+ community. It also appears that the student body seems to be \nfar more comfortable with the concept of using gender neutral pronouns than staff or faculty. \nThe last deduction is that for the most part, the people who were surveyed feel that WPI is at \nleast somewhat accepting of the LGBTQIAP+ community. However the largest number of \npeople who disagree are members of the LGBTQIAP+ community themselves. \n \n \nFigure 10: Campus Acceptance Towards LGBTQIAP+ Community According to \nFreshmen and Sophomores Who Self-Identify \n \nPronoun Training Development \nInterviews \nIt was observed from the survey that a majority of those surveyed is someone or knows \nsomeone who identifies as members of the LGBTQIAP+ community. 70.18% of the students \nsurveyed indicated that they knew someone who used gender neutral pronouns. While the \nsurvey also asks for an opinion on the acceptance of LGBTQIAP+ community members on the \nWPI campus, it does not ask about acceptance specifically regarding pronouns. To investigate \nthis further, a series of interviews was conducted. Four community members belonging to The \nAlliance were asked questions about their pronouns and their experiences with them in an \neducational atmosphere and in a social atmosphere. \n 18 \n The first question that the participants were asked was what their preferred pronouns \nare. Two participants used she/her pronouns, one used they/them pronouns and the last \nparticipant used either they/them or he/him pronouns. They were then asked why they used \nthese pronouns. Some of these responses had to do with gender identification as well as \ncomfort. One participant remarked,  \n“I never felt connected to the pronouns that I was assigned at birth”. \n -Undergraduate Student \n \n Next the participants were asked if they had ever asked another student on this campus \nto use those pronouns. Three participants responded that they have asked people to use those \npronouns. Those participants were asked how that experience went for them. For one \nindividual, their pronouns were understood and respected. The other two participants \nexpressed that it depended on the student that they were asking. Accepting and understanding \nstudents went on to use those pronouns while students who were uneducated or unfamiliar did \nnot really respond to the request. The one participant who had never asked anyone to use \nthese pronouns said that it was because their pronouns were always correctly assumed. \n A similar question was then raised to the participants, it asked them if they had ever \nasked the same thing of a faculty or staff member. The same three participants from above had \nreplied that they did. Two of those participants explained that it went very well or “better than \nI had expected”. One of those three participants explained that they had varying success. The \nlast participant stated that they had never asked a staff or faculty member to use their \npreferred pronouns. \n The participants were then asked if they felt safe and welcome in the WPI Community. \nThree participants responded that they did in all aspects, in both social spaces and in class. One \nparticipant just felt okay as an individual in the community but less so regarding personal or \ntransgender topics. They stated, \n“Generally, I feel okay about WPI. Not, generally, about trans and nonbinary issues that \nI’ve had to deal with personally.” - Undergraduate Student  \n \nThe one participant who expressed negative feelings about being safe or welcome at WPI was \nthan asked what made them feel unsafe. They responded that,  \n 19 \n“I think a lot of what the negative responses I’ve gotten is simply due to lack of \nknowledge and lack of training. So, I feel like if more people understood things about \ntrans and nonbinary issues it would be a lot better community and more open to people \nwho identify because I know that’s a large problem. Especially with incoming students. \nSo, just more of an emphasis on it on campus as a whole would make things significantly \nimproved.” \n - Undergraduate Student \nFocus Group \nInformed by the survey and interview responses, a first draft of a pronoun training was \nprepared by the IQP team, based on individual experiences with the subject matter and \nbackground research. A focus group of eight participants was recruited from the undergraduate \ngeneral body of the WPI Alliance to whom the pronoun training draft was presented. The \nparticipants were asked to complete two questionnaires, one before and one after the focus \ngroup activity that evaluated their opinions of the training. The first questionnaire asked the \nparticipants for expectations of the pronoun training and familiarity with gender neutral \npronouns. The second questionnaire asked for feedback after the participants were given the \npronoun training in regards to efficacy and representation. The three questions asked during \nthe first questionnaire were: \n1. What do you expect out of a pronoun training? \n2. Do you consider yourself to be knowledgeable about gender neutral pronouns? \n3. How comfortable are you using gender neutral pronouns? \nThe questions asked in the second questionnaire were: \n1. What did you think of the training? \n2. How effective do you think it would be to individuals who know absolutely nothing \nabout the subject matter? \n3. Are we under- or over-representing any populations? \n4. What could be done to improve the effectiveness of the training? \nAll of the questions were free response.  \nIn the first questionnaire, it was found that most of the participants were concerned \nabout conveying to trainees the importance of respecting another person’s pronouns. Some \nparticipants expected the training to include “tools for avoiding misgendering people, \nrespecting pronouns, and not assuming pronouns”. One participant expected “more awareness \nabout what different pronouns mean”. All participants identified themselves as at least \n 20 \nsomewhat knowledgeable about gender neutral pronouns and comfortable with using gender \nneutral pronouns.  \nIn the second questionnaire, it was found that many of the participants thought the \ntraining to be “good”, “informative”, “fairly comprehensive”, and “concise”. Most participants \nthought the training to be effective for individuals who knew nothing about the subject matter \nbut many clarified that this training should be the first of many steps toward understanding \ngender neutral pronouns. One participant expressed concern with the way gender were \ncovered. They were “a little worried that people still won’t understand gender basics”. All \nparticipants felt that there was no over- or under-representation of any populations. One \nparticipant noted a “focus on non-binary people” but considered that to be “warranted”. \nAnother participant suggested adding “gender queer as a more overarching trans identity”. \nSuggest improvements to the training included “to never use “it” pronouns”, “address \nspecifically what happens when pronouns are not respected”, “looking into comments about a \nprofessor’s inclusiveness after the training”, and “more runs of the presentation”. \n \nLGBTQIAP+ Resource Center \nA series of interviews with open-ended questions was conducted to gauge WPI’s \ncampus about both their awareness of LGBTQIAP+ issues on campus and what tools an \nappropriate resource center should have available. Six individuals, ranging from student to staff \nmember and member of the LGBTQIAP+ community to not self-identifying, participated in \nthese interviews. \nThe first question asked to the participants was regarding the participant’s knowledge of \nthe campus climate around the LGBTQIAP+ community. Five out of the six participants \nexpressed that they felt WPI’s acceptance and attitude towards these issues was relatively \npositive. One participant who shared this sentiment stated,  \n“I think it’s actually - I’m - I’ve been surprised by the - I think it’s pretty good. I think that \na lot of it has to do with the last campus I was on was a year and a half ago and I think \nthings have changed. So I’m not being personally affected by it on campus but I still think \nit seems to be pretty decent”. \n 21 \n-Faculty Member \n \nHowever, the one participant who did not agree said, \n“I think that I see less negative issues because I try to surround myself with people who \naren’t close minded. But, overall I think that people aren’t educated and there’s a lot of \nmicroaggressions that go on on-campus that I’ve noticed from people in and out of the \ncommunity”.  \n-Undergraduate Student \nThe second question presented to the participants asked them what resources WPI \noffers its LGBTQIAP+ community that they were familiar with. Only one participant could not \nname a single resource. The other participants mentioned student run organizations such as \nThe Alliance and the Gender Equality Club, they also mentioned the preferred name initiative \nwith Bannerweb and the Gender Neutral Bathrooms IQP as well as the Safe Zone Committee \nand the resources at the SDCC. However, no one participant was able to mention all of these. \nThe third question raised to the participants was if they would ever go to the resource \ncenter if it did exist. Four participants said that they would definitely go and two said that they \nwere not sure. One of the unsure participants expressed after being asked to explain their \nfeelings,  \n“...mostly because, personally, I don’t feel like I need support. But, as an ally I \ndefinitely think that me going and showing my support would be a good thing. \nBut, I don’t know exactly what they would be planning to use the resource center \nfor, so, it just kind of depends”. \n-Undergraduate Student \n \n After this the participants were asked how they thought that WPI could better provide \nfor its LGBTQIAP+ community member. Four out of the six participants said that a resource \ncenter would be the best way to do this. Other suggestions were pronoun trainings, amending \nthe housing system, acknowledging the existence of the hardships of the community, and just \ngenerally making the protection of the LGBT community a larger priority. One participant \nmentioned, \n“Well, these are hard questions for me because I’m not on campus very much. So \nI don’t actually know everything that’s here. But I think a center that combines \nsocial and practical stuff would be really cool”. \n 22 \n-Faculty Member \n \nNext the participants were asked what resources, service and amenities they would like \nto see be available in a resource center such as this. Some common themes in the varied \nresponses were gender neutral or inclusive bathrooms, the availability of Alliance office hours \nor counseling, and a comfortable space to inhabit that included several couches and surfaces to \ndo school work on. \n The participants were then asked how they thought the center should be staffed. All of \nthe interviewed participants expressed that a mixture of adult and student staff all belonging to \nor supportive of the community would be the most beneficial to the center. \n The final question that the participants were asked was about what kind of space the \nresource center should inhabit. All six participants reported that WPI should grant at least an \nentire floor of a building to this space. Two participants said that is should inhabit an entire \nhouse similar to the OASIS House model. One participant responded, \n“Probably a small house just off campus. That way you’re still in the campus community \nbut far enough that it’s almost escaping the atmosphere of - like, if it’s during finals \nweek you’re escaping the atmosphere of the ‘I have to do everything right now’ \npressures and could just relax, be yourself, and study.” \n- Undergraduate Student \n \nIn gathering this data, we were able to discover several things. The data from the survey \nhelped find out that the majority of faculty or staff were not aware of gender neutral pronouns, \nand that most people somewhat agree with the statement that WPI is accepting of students \nwho self-identify as members of the LGBTQIAP+ community. The pronoun training interviews \nand focus groups provided affirmation for the need of a gender neutral pronoun training on \ncampus as well as providing good feedback on the pronoun training demonstration. The \nResource Center Interviews provided a number of perspectives on the campus climate around \nthe LGBTQIAP+ community, and also provided incentive to raise awareness of all of the \nresources that are available to the WPI LGBTQIAP+ community. All of these separate pieces can \nbe connected in support of both the pronoun training that was written and the construction of \nan LGBTQIAP+ resource center on campus. \n 23 \nDISCUSSION \nThe general purpose of this IQP was to investigate the manifestation of gender \nneutrality at WPI and develop something that would promote and support the diversity of this \ncampus. Our aim was to focus specifically on the local LGBTQIAP+ population and create tools \nand resources to not only grant them visibility but also safety and comfort. This was extremely \nimportant for us because we feel that this demographic is currently not given the full range of \nsupport and recognition that they are entitled to at an institution of this size and prestige.  \n  In order to accomplish this goal, we devised a plan for a Gender Neutral Pronoun \nTraining, as well as a proposal for an LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center. In providing such a resource \ncenter in conjunction with the training, the WPI community would be taking steps forward in \nfostering a safer environment for a diverse population. To ascertain the need for such \nresources, we not only distributed a survey to members of the WPI community, but also \nconducted various interviews and focus groups. \n \nPronoun Training \nInterviews \nIn the interviews conducted regarding pronouns, it was observed that participants who \npreferred she/her or he/him pronouns had less difficulty asking others in the campus \ncommunity to use those pronouns. Participants who preferred they/them pronouns had \nvarying difficulty, depending on the person they were asking. One participant said that “with \npeople … who aren’t cis-het, it tends to do over a lot better” and with “some people...can be a \nlittle more nonresponsive to the suggestion.” This same participant said the following: \n“Generally I feel okay about WPI. Not, generally, about trans- and non-binary issues that \nI’ve had to deal with personally. … I think a lot of what the negative responses I’ve gotten is \nsimply due to lack of knowledge and lack of training.” - Undergraduate Student \nA student not feeling safe to express themselves on the WPI campus is a point of \nconcern for the entire campus community. A school needs to foster a safe learning \nenvironment for all of its students. As discussed in the background, this can hinder a student’s \n 24 \ncapacity for learning. As a campus, we need to focus on validating the identities of transgender \nand gender-non-conforming students on our campus, making them feel safe and welcome at \nWPI. The same way we provide support system for the women and students of color, we need \nto provide for LGBTQIAP+ students. \nWe can provide this support system through an array of different ways. We can work to \nmake the campus community more competent at dealing with LGBTQIAP+ issues. This can be \naccomplished through training. The existing Safe Zone Training offered by the Safe Zone \nCommittee is an effective way to educate faculty, staff, and students in being able to better \nsupport their peers. In order to prevent misgendering and the adverse effects of it, we \nrecommend developing and adding Pronoun Training to the Safe Zone curriculum. This training \nshould be available to all students, faculty and staff. It should be required for community \nleaders such as Resident Advisors and staff members to receive this training. \n \nFocus Group \nIn the questionnaire results from the focus group, we were able to gain some insight as \nto what we might have missed in writing up the Pronoun Training. One of the participants \nnoticed and voiced that we had failed to discuss use of “it” as a pronoun in the training. The \npronoun “it” will be added to the training and it will be stressed that it is offensive to refer to \nanother person using “it” pronouns unless asked specifically by the other person.Other \nparticipants were concerned that the concept of gender was not fully covered in the training. \nWe recognized that gender is a large and daunting topic to talk about and that many, many \ntraining modules could be written and never cover gender in entirety. In future, we will \nemphasize that the training is not meant to be a crash course in gender, but in preferred \npronouns. \nMost participants expressed that the training would only be the first step for community \nmembers to learn about gender neutral pronouns and supporting transgender and gender-non-\nconforming people. It was clear there was a desire for a resource for trainees to be able to \ncontinue learning. For this reason, a participant handbook will be provided along with the \ntraining. This will be available to all trainees in physical and digital forms with a number of \n 25 \nresources including: material covered in training, books and links for further reading, \norganizations to support, and a directory of on-campus support systems. \nIt was also recognized that it is unreasonable to expect trainees to memorize all gender \nneutral pronouns. Focus group participants asked that we emphasize that trainees should take \naway an openness to learn about new and different pronoun sets, and a willingness to improve \nin pronoun awareness. \nThe complete and revised training will be provided to the Alliance and the Safe Zone \nCommittee. The Safe Zone Committee Student Chair will be responsible for coordinating and \nscheduling training schedules. We recommend that the training is updated once each year to \nensure the campus community is being provided with the most current information. \n \nResource Center \n In the survey that was distributed to campus, 93.67% of participants said they knew at \nleast one individual who identified within the LGBTQIAP+ community. However, not one \nindividual who was interviewed about an LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center could name the full \nrange of resources available to the members of this community. This could imply that either \nthere is a lack of proactivity in the student body to discover the resources available to enrich \ntheir experience at this institution or WPI isn’t properly advertising all of the materials they \nprovide. In reality, it is probably a mixture of both. There is a factor of intimidation for students \nto ask for help at any type of school but this factor is increased at a place centered around the \nSTEM field and a place of such prestige. It’s a stigma to ask for help academically or socially, \nsome students feel as though it’s an admittance of weakness or lesser intelligence. This could \nprevent students from seeking out the resources that they have a right to access. It is also \nsometimes difficult to find these resources because of WPI’s many layers of administration. \nOften when asking a pertinent personal question you are sent to the head of another \ndepartment who sends you to someone below them who might know something about your \nproblem. However, if an LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center existed, there would be no question of \n 26 \nwhat resources were available to that community (see Appendix C). They would all be housed \nin one convenient location accessible by students and allies of all backgrounds.  \n A common answer to the question of what WPI could do to better provide for its \nLGBTQIAP+ population among the resource center interviews was simply to grant them more \nvisibility and to prioritize the issues that affect their community. Although 75.46% of the \nparticipants of the general survey felt that WPI was at least somewhat accepting towards this \ncommunity, there is still almost one fourth who did not feel this way. Additionally, 23.79% of \nthe survey’s participants self-identified as LGBTQIAP+. All of this data together suggests that \nWPI’s LGTBQIAP+ population is growing and while the majority of people believe that WPI is \nnot a hostile environment for this community to exist in, it is not felt that WPI as an institution \ndoes not properly acknowledge them. This is understandable considering WPI’s history of being \nan all male, all cisgender, and mostly white engineering school for so many years. However in \nthe last few decades the institution has been heading in a new and exponentially diverse \ndirection. This includes the current position of president being filled by a wonderfully qualified \nwoman. This issue of underrepresentation is not just a problem on a local level. An examination \nof pop culture and modern, national politics reveals the same trend. Media tends to be hetero \nand cisgender normative while legislation is continually drafted to drafted to suppress the \nrights of the LGBTQIAP+ population. There is no better statement for WPI to make than to \ndedicate the time and capital to an LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center to support this growing \ndemographic of its population (see Appendix C). This would be especially powerful in the \npolitical climate of 2017 with figures in office who are infamous for hate speech towards those \nwithin the LGBTQIAP+ community.  \n Another noteworthy theme that arose during the interview process was that no one \nthought the resource center would be suitable in a space smaller than an entire floor. This \nimplies that the student and faculty of WPI believe that this is an issue worthy of WPI’s space, \nwhich is a very valuable commodity, given the size of the campus. Several individuals brought \nup the fact that a shared space wouldn’t work for this particular venture. This is because the \nwe, the IQP team and the interviewers, felt that the space should be private and secluded in \norder to respect its inhabitants and ensure that no one with ill intentions could have an excuse \n 27 \nto be in the space. This incentivises WPI to not just put this resource center in a small room in \nthe corner of the library in an unused tech suite but instead to plan an appropriate and \nrespectable home. Furthermore, a theme also prevalent in the interviews was that every single \nparticipant expressed they would visit the center, even if they didn’t find the services necessary \nfor themselves. This suggests that it would not become an exclusionary space that is \nuncomfortable for people outside of the LGBTQIAP+ community to inhabit. It also suggests that \nit would not be an underutilized space if WPI did choose to construct one (see Appendix C). \n \nProject Limitations \nThere are a few important notes to keep in mind when thinking about the \nrecommendations made in this section. The first is that of the six interviews that were \nconducted on this topic, five of them were with undergraduate students. There were no \ninterviews conducted with graduate students and only one interview conducted with a faculty \nmember. Four out of the six interviews were conducted with members of the Alliance. The \nfocus group session was conducted immediately after an Alliance general body meeting, \ncausing the focus group to be completely made up of Alliance members. Members of the \nAlliance have a greater general knowledge of the issues that affect the LGBTQIAP+ community \nthan unaffiliated students.  \nWith regards to the Gender Neutral Pronoun Training, these aspects of the interviews \nput some limitations on what feedback we could receive. Specifically, the 5 undergraduate \nstudents and one faculty member that were interviewed. Since there were no interviews \nconducted with them, we could not get any insight from the perspective of a graduate student. \nFurthermore, 4 out of the 5 undergraduate students interviewed were members of The \nAlliance, which limits the amount of responses we could get from unaffiliated students to one. \nWhen drafting questions for the survey we distributed across campus, we had to \nconsider several things, such as respect for the responders’ privacy as well as following the \nrules of conducting such a survey as stated by the IRB. Additionally, we had little to no control \nover who took the survey resulting in a much larger amount of faculty and staff responses as \n 28 \nopposed to responses from the student body. This limited control also determined how many \nresponses we got, as it was not possible for us to distribute the survey across the entire campus \npopulation. In spite of all of these limiting factors, the survey was still able to produce fruitful \nresults, and valid findings. \n \nIQP Team: Personal Growth \n The team members working on this project benefitted in their own unique ways and \ngained their own unique set of tools to carry with them in their academic pursuits. This section \nis dedicated to giving room for their personal accounts and descriptions of the knowledge \nthey’ve gained.  \nLeo Bunyea \nI heard about this project through a staff member of the OMA and couldn’t resist the \nopportunity to work on a topic that was so personal to me. This past summer I came out as a \ntransgender man and was ready to champion the cause of gender inclusivity on campus. This \nproject not only taught me about responsibility, time management, and how to work around \nthe schedules of my group mates but it also connected me to various community members, \nstudent organizations and resources that I never had the chance to explore. If it weren’t for the \nevents of this IQP I would never have been so deeply involved in the Safe Zone Committee or \nhave a position on the executive board of the Alliance or have met such wonderful people like \nJulia Sorcinelli, Professor Hall-Phillips, and Michelle Jones-Johnson. I am extremely grateful for \nhaving played a part in this whole endeavor because it has allowed me to grow academically, \nsocially, and emotionally.  \n \nPat Linzo \nPrior to joining the project team, I had been serving as the President of the Alliance. I \ncame to WPI’s campus wanting to come out and live authentically as a gender-non-conforming \nindividual. I was met immediately with resistance stemming from antiquated policies of the \nuniversity. While I was able to find a community that supported me regardless of gender status, \n 29 \nexpression or identity, the campus community at large still felt unwelcoming. Since then, I have \ntaken every opportunity to prevent my experiences to repeat themselves among all students to \nenter WPI from now forward. Working on this project, I learned the different avenues through \nwhich I can push my activism. I also gained valuable knowledge in small group work and how \nthat differs from whole club operations and larger group work. In communicating with the \nteam, our advisor, and the people who attended our presentation, I have gained invaluable \ncommunication skills to carry with me into my career. I learned how to manage my time more \neffectively, with my activism taking up the space of one class as opposed to an extracurricular \nactivity. What, to me, was most valuable was, becoming meeting with and becoming acutely \naware of the advocates and supporters transgender and gender-non-conforming WPI \ncommunity members have. \n \nChris DeJesus \nIn cooperating on this project I have learned much about what it takes to accomplish a \nproject of this scale: time, coordination, and cooperation. Additionally I have learned that the \nproper management of time is extremely important, as managing this alongside my other \ncourses proved to be amongst the most challenging things I’ve done. There were many times \nwhere I felt like I was unable to keep going, but through the support of my peers and our \nprofessor, I found myself able to proceed. Perseverance in the face of hardship proved to be a \nkey component in this project, as well as not being afraid to ask for help when needed. \n \n  \n 30 \nCONCLUSION \nWPI’s community is evolving and needs the proper programs and resources to support \nit. In order to foster the social growth of WPI’s community we set out to not only write a gender \nneutral pronoun training, but also to draft a proposal for an LGBTQIAP+ resource center on \ncampus. The gender neutral pronoun training would mainly provide students, staff and faculty \nwith the opportunity to practice using unfamiliar pronouns and to provide the nonbinary \ncommunity at WPI visibility. The existence of an LGBTQIAP+ resource center center on campus \nwould grant a physical space to that particular community to meet and connect with like-\nminded peers. However, it would also be a massive statement of acceptance and protection by \nWPI in the modern political climate.  \n When polling the campus on their general knowledge of the LGBTQIAP+ community at \nWPI, we found that our participants were not only somewhat familiar with it but also extremely \nsupportive of it. The majority of responses indicated that they felt WPI’s atmosphere was open \nand accepting. The education that was generally lacking was with regards to transgender issues \nfacing nonbinary folks. In addition to this fact, among the individuals that were interacted with \nnot one could name the full range of resources available to the LGBTQIAP+ community. When \nwe asked students and faculty about their suggestions for an LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center and \ntheir thoughts on it’s usage, every participant expressed that they would feel comfortable \nspending time there and that it should inhabit at the very least an entire floor of a building. The \nmajority of participants also said that this is the best way that WPI could provide for its \nLGBTQIAP+ community. During the focus group sessions that we held for the first draft of the \ngender neutral pronoun trainings, the question of effectiveness was raised. Focus group \nmembers discussed the fact that a simple one hour session may not alter the behavior of the \ntrainees in their practices at WPI. They also stressed the inclusion of “it” being an offensive \npronoun. In spite of this, the training was generally well received. \n The progress towards diversity and inclusion on this campus made by this IQP team is \nvital to the quality of life of WPI’s LGBTQIAP+ population. The gender neutral pronoun training \nthat was drafted specifically for this campus will grant visibility to the nonbinary students, staff, \n 31 \nand faculty on this campus and validate their identity in the minds of the less knowledgeable. \nUsing an individual's preferred pronouns is the most basic form of respect and \nacknowledgment. The concept of asking a new acquaintance what their preferred pronouns are \nshould be normalized as common courtesy and that is why this training needs to be \nadministered by organizations like the Safe Zone Committee. A similar argument can be made \nfor the importance on building an LGBTQIAP+ Resource Center. WPI’s administration should \nseriously consider this because every individual should have access to a space where they feel \nmetaphorically at home. A space where they can be connected with like minded peers and have \nall resources relevant to their identity on this campus at their fingertips. If an individual is \nuncomfortable or anxious, then they cannot operate at their maximum capacity for greatness. \nWe urge WPI as an institution to review this project and use its data and resources to further \nthe clause of inclusion with regards to all minorities and not just with this specific population. \n  \n 32 \nREFERENCES \nThe Alliance (2016).

But, I’m definitely not personally \ninvolved so I don’t know how accurately I could say what level it’s at. But, generally people \nseem to be pretty accepting. \n \nInterviewer: Alright. Our second question is; what do you know about resources on campus \ncurrently available to the LGBTQIAP+ community members? \n \nParticipant: Personally, I don’t think I could name a single resource. \n \nInterviewer: So our third question is; if there was an LGBTQIAP+ resource center on campus \nwould you go there? Um, yes, no, or you’re not sure. \n \nParticipant: Um, I don’t - I’m not sure. \n \nInterviewer: Is there any particular reason why you’re not sure, or? \n \nParticipant: Mostly because, personally, I don’t feel like I need support. But, as an ally I \ndefinitely think that me going and showing my support would be a good thing. But, I don’t know \nexactly what they would be planning to use the resource center for, so, it just kind of depends. \n \nInterviewer: Thank you. Our fourth question is; what could WPI do to better provide for its \nLGBTQIAP+ community members? \n \nParticipant: Probably a ridiculously large amount of things since I can’t even think of a single \nthing that they do that is helpful. Um, probably making it more accepting and making it a bigger \npriority that the community is actually taken care of and given rights and help *laughs*. \n \nInterviewer: So, our last question is; if there was an LGBTQIAP+ resource center on this campus \nwhat resources would you expect to be available? Is the first part of the question. \n 34 \n \nParticipant: I would hope that they would have some sort of counseling because I’m sure \nthere’s a lot of people that are unsure of themselves and they need some direction and a little \nbit of guidance. Especially because this topic It’s kind of pushed under the rug a lot. \n \nInterviewer: The second part to that questions is; what services/ amenities would you expect to \nbe available? \n \nParticipant: Well, definitely people to talk to. I hope that they would have a bunch of different \nbathrooms that people felt comfortable using - and it would be pretty awful if that was the only \nplace on campus that people felt comfortable using the bathroom but, I mean, you gotta start \nsomewhere. Um, definitely a safe space with some nice couches that make you feel good and \nyou can talk to other people that are like-minded. \n \nInterviewer: The third part; how would you expect it to be staffed? \n \nParticipant: Definitely depending on the size of the space and what resources they were \nplanning to offer, I’d probably see a staff of maybe five to ten people. I think that would be \npretty fair. \n \nInterviewer: And the last part of our last question is; what kind of space would be most \neffective for this sort of center, for example, an office, a building, an entire floor, a specific \nlocation on campus, et cetera. \n \nParticipant: I think at the very least, a whole floor. I think it’s pretty important that it’s one \nspace not just like a little piece of a room that’s kind of roped off. I think the whole point of \nfeeling comfortable in the space is important and in my head it looks very comfortable. \n \nInterviewer: Thank you! \n \nParticipant: You’re very welcome. \n \n  \n 35 \nInterview 2: \nInterviewer: So our first question is; how is the campus climate around LGBTQIAP+ community \nmembers and issues, in your opinion? \n \nParticipant: How is it? \n \nInterviewer: Yeah. \n \nParticipant: I think it’s actually - I’m - I’ve been surprised by the - I think it’s pretty good. I think \nthat a lot of it has to do with the last campus I was on was a year and a half ago and I think \nthings have changed. So I’m not being personally affected by it on campus but I still think it \nseems to be pretty decent. \n \nInterviewer: What do you know about resources on campus currently available to LGBTQIAP+ \ncommunity members? \n \nParticipant: Well, I’m doing the SafeZone training, I haven’t done it yet. There’s also a whole \nbunch of stuff on - actually I don’t know which part of the website it is - but it’s about how to \naddress people in class, how to if someone comes up with an issue because they are then how \nto direct them to somebody who can help or if it’s like harassment or just it’s getting me down, \nyou know? \n \nInterviewer: If there was an LGBTQIAP+ resource center on campus would you go there? Yes, \nno, or you’re not sure. \n \nParticipant: It depends on what its focus is since I don’t fall into any of those letters. I wouldn’t \ngo there specifically for help but I would go there to help if asked - like if I was asked by the \ndiversity department and so on. \n \nInterviewer: What could WPI do to better provide for its LGBTQIAP+ community members? \n \nParticipant: Well, these are hard questions for me because I’m not on campus very much. So I \ndon’t actually know everything that’s here. But I think a center that combines social and \npractical stuff would be really cool. \n \nInterviewer: So, this next question is a multi-parter. So, the umbrella question is if there was an \nLGBTQIAP+ resource center on this campus,first part, what resources would you expect to be \navailable? \n 36 \n \nParticipant: I would expect there to be counseling. I would expect there to be, actually a full \nrange of resources as there are to every other student. I would match it. Even though people \ncould use that as well but I would have them particularly for the community. \n \nInterviewer: So, the next part of that question falls under the same thing it’s just what services/ \namenities would you expect, so I assume it’s like similar answers. \n \nParticipant: Uh, a whole bar. \n \nInterviewer: *laughs* \n \nParticipant: Um, no *laughs*. I’ve always found I gravitated more towards places like that. Uh, \nno. I would - what’s the question? Sorry. \n \nInterviewer: What services/ amenities would you expect to be available? \n \nParticipant: Again, everything that’s available to everybody else and without trying to make a \nsubset of it. \n \nInterviewer: How would you expect it to be staffed? \n \nParticipant: I would hope it could be staffed with both LG..B..  \n \nInterviewer: T \n \nParticipant: There are a bunch of letters. LGBT people but as well as not. I think it should be a \ncross section of the community. I think everything should be diverse I think there should be \nMuslim students, you know, everything. \n \nInterviewer: So the last part of the last question is what kind of space would be most effective \nfor this center? For example an office, an entire building, an entire floor, et cetera. \n \nParticipant: I think it should have its own space. Offices I don’t think. Maybe there could be \noffices as part of it when you’re doing one on one counseling or help of some kind. But, I think \nthere should also be an activity place for people, a social area. So, I think I’m talking about at \nleast a floor. I think on a campus this size asking for an entire building might be a little difficult. \nBut I think a floor of, like, the campus center, or something like that. Or a place in the Campus \n 37 \nCenter. Like it’s own area that would have to have some sort of controlled entrance so you \ncan’t just wander in at lunch. Something like that. Is that okay? \n \nInterviewer: Yeah! Thank you for your time. \n \nInterview 3: \nInterviewer: How is campus climate around LGBTQIAP+ community members and issues? \n \nParticipant: As a whole? \n \nInterviewer: As a whole. \n \nParticipant: I think that I see less negative issues because I try to surround myself with people \nwho aren’t close minded. But, overall I think that people aren’t educated and there’s a lot of \nmicroaggressions that go on on-campus that I’ve noticed from people in and out of the \ncommunity. That’s something that I think needs to be worked on for it to become at all \nwelcoming enough for students. \n \nInterviewer: What do you know about resources on campus that are currently available to self-\nidentifying community members? \n \nParticipant: I know about the initiative for names on your - preferred names on your emails \ndifferent - Blackboard - websites. I know about the gender neutral bathroom initiative. I know \nthat… What else do I know? I don’t know. \n \nInterviewer: You know about the Alliance. \n \nParticipant: Oh! Wow! I do know about the Alliance. \n \nInterviewer: I mean, maybe you know about the Alliance. \n \nParticipant: Maybe I know about the Alliance. I mean, hypothetically as an anonymous data \npoint. I know that there’s different gender equality clubs. That’s pretty cool too. They try \nsometimes. \n \nInterviewer: If there was an LGBTQIAP+ resource center on campus would you go there? \n \nParticipant: Yes, I would because I’m tired of the cishet community here at WPI. \n 38 \n \nInterviewer: What could WPI do to better provide for its LGBTQIAP+ community members? \n \nParticipant: Acknowledging them would be - as a larger focus - would be a lot more... A lot \nmore better [sic] is what I was going to say but if you’re quoting me at all - \n \nInterviewer: We’re probably not going to quote you. \n \nParticipant: Good because words are hard. Can you repeat the question? \n \nInterviewer: How can WPI better provide. \n \nParticipant: Providing more resources. I know that there are attempts to make things better \nlike with the IQP last year and the gender neutral bathrooms. I still don’t know of the signs \nbeing put up around campus and I think just having those around would be a lot more “in your \nface” response. It shows that WPI is actually standing with the trans community at large and I \nwould love to see it but it’s been over a year since that order went out to put those signs up… \nSo. You know what. I’d like to see that. I’d like a larger emphasis with professors because I know \nstudents who have come to me about different professors responding badly about names and \npronouns and just being disrespectful of various identities. It’s really frustrating when someone \nin that position of power is dismissive to how you identify and I don’t think that’s the \ncommunity WPI should be supporting. I think we should be putting a heavier emphasis on \nacceptance overall. Also, housing sucks. Yeah.. I’m going to leave it, housing sucks. \n \nInterviewer: If was an LGBTQIAP+ resource center on campus what resources would you expect \nto be available? \n \nParticipant: I think expanding on media resources that the OASIS house has would be really \ncool. But also, like, non-depressing movies… Just resources for mental health and counseling. \nJust a fun hangout space. It’s really great to have a space you can go where people there \nunderstand at all what you’re going through and I think it’s especially beneficial for people \nbecause there’s such a high prevalence of depression and anxiety within the LGBTQIAP+ \ncommunity. I think it’s a really great way to allow that type of support to help them with self-\ncare and just being able to support these kids as we go through the term. \n \nInterviewer: What services and amenities would you expect to be available? \n \nParticipant: Five course meals 24/7. \n 39 \n \nInterviewer: *laughs* Every hour is another five course meal? \n \nParticipant: Yeah! We’re hungry people! \n \nInterviewer: We are hungry. \n \nParticipant: Amenities? I don’t think it really needs to be that fancy or anything. I think having a \nplace to sit with a couple shelves. Maybe a TV but, like, seating and books. I like reading so I \nthink a cool place to hang out maybe have a table or a couple tables to maybe sit and do work \nwould be really cool. \n \nInterviewer: I’m sorry, so do we sit on the tables? \n \nParticipant: Yeah. Sit on the tables and then do your work on the chairs. *joking* \n \nInterviewer: How would you expect it to be staffed? \n \nParticipant: Like? \n \nInterviewer: Like a faculty/ staff member like a real life adult or like a work study person or \nmaybe the Alliance would have office hours or maybe just a student worker… \n \nParticipant: I think having either a student worker or I think Alliance office hours would be \nreally cool now that you mention that. Whoever executive people are on the Alliance. I don’t \nknow who they are but whoever ends up being exec would have a lot of fun doing that, I think. \n \nInterviewer: What kind of space do you think would be most effective for this resource center? \nLike an office? Or like a whole building? Or the floor of a building? Or one of those off campus \nhouse office things? \n \nParticipant: I think the whole Foisie Innovation Studio should go to the Alliance. But honestly -  \n \nInterviewer: If we’re thinking fiscally. \n \nParticipant: Fiscally, I hesitate to say an entire house. I would love an entire house but a floor of \na building like that, an off campus building. It’s on campus technically, but one of those houses, \n 40 \noff the hill buildings that are reformatted to hold different apartments I think having maybe a \nroom or a couple rooms would be really beneficial. \n \nInterviewer: Okay, thank you so much! \nInterview 4: \nInterviewer: The first question is how is the campus climate around LGBTQIAP+ community \nmembers and issues? \n \nParticipant: I think it’s generally pretty good. Because whenever I see something pop up about \nthat, I don’t usually see like opposition jor anything and, I mean, the Alliance has a good \npresence, they table sit a lot. That kind of thing and there’s the little stickers everywhere. I think \nthe SDCC and other organizations that already exist are like inclusive, so. \n \nInterviewer: What do you know about resources that are currently available to LGBTQIAP+ \ncommunity members?  \n \nParticipant: Well, there’s the Alliance. The SDCC has something, I think. I’m not really sure. \n \nInterviewer: They have a support group. Is that what you mean? \n \nParticipant: Yeah, something like that. I don’t know that there’s anything else specific to it. \n \nInterviewer: If there was an LGBTQIAP+ resource center on this campus would you go there? \n \nParticipant: Probably if I had time. \n \nInterviewer: What could WPI do to better provide for its LGBTQ community members? \n \nParticipant: I mean, that resource center sounds like one of the best ideas I’ve heard for that in \na while. \n \nInterviewer: If there was an LGBTQ resource center on campus, what resources would you \nexpect to be available? \n \nParticipant: Um, probably a similar support group thing like at the SDCC and, I don’t know, \nprobably something to help you, like, navigate campus related things especially with, i guess \nlike pronouns and stuff. Probably there’d be like visibility resources for the many letters that \n 41 \npeople forget. I guess probably trans resources would be a big one because there are a lot of \nthings that are sometimes hard to access. \n \nInterviewer: What services or amenities would you expect to be available? I think you kind of \nanswered that with, like, support groups. But do you have any? \n \nParticipant: Amenities? I don’t know exactly how that would fit in except with just general \nbuilding things. Maybe they could push for a gender neutral bathroom type thing or at least \ninclusive gendered ones. \n \nInterviewer: How would you expect it to be staffed? So maybe like a real life faculty/ staff \nperson or like a student worker? \n \nParticipant: I mean, I guess having some staff would be ideal. I guess they wouldn’t need \nnecessarily additional therapists or whatever because the SDCC has those and they can direct \nyou to that. I mean, maybe an LGBT specific one, like, experienced in that or something. \n \nInterviewer: What kind of space to you think would be most effective for this kind of center? \nLike an office, a building, like a whole floor? And where on campus. \n \nParticipant: You know how SDCC is in like one of the houses over there? \n \nInterviewer: Yeah. \n \nParticipant: So, probably something like that would be good because, i don’t know, it feels kind \nof home-y and has a lot of space. It’s not like a, you know, clinical office kind of thing.  \n \nInterviewer: Awesome. Thank you so much!  \n 42 \nInterview 5: \nInterviewer: How is the campus climate around LGBTQIAP+ community members and issues? \n \nParticipant: It’s definitely inclusive to a point but there’s definitely a higher rate of inclusivity \ncompared to other communities I’ve been in. \n \nInterviewer: What do you know about resources on campus currently available to those \ncommunity members? \n \nParticipant: I know that we have The Alliance which is a pretty great student organization, they \ndo a good job with that. Then there’s the Safe Zone Committee which is faculty and staff based. \n \nInterviewer: If there was a queer resource center on campus would you go there? \n \nParticipant: Heck yeah. \n \nInterviewer: Why? \n \nParticipant: Because I think it would be a very valuable resource for LGBT students and also \nthose seeking to get information just in general. \n \nInterviewer: What could WPI do better to provide for its LGBTQIAP+ community members? \n \nParticipant: I would say have a pronoun training for faculty and staff and potentially RAs and \nalso a queer resource center would be incredibly valuable. \n \nInterviewer: If there were a queer resource center on campus what resources would you \nexpect to be available? \n \nParticipant: I would expect some type of support staff people there with like office hours or \nsomething like that. Maybe reading materials and informations… So, books, other resources. \nMaybe candy. Candy would be nice. \n \nInterviewer: What services or amenities would you expect to be available? \n \nParticipant: Services? I would say just like answers to questions. Maybe a counselor contact? \nThat would be cool. \n \n 43 \nInterviewer: How would you expect it to be staffed? \n \nParticipant: Probably in a similar manner to how the OASIS house is staffed. So, like, students \nworking there or people having office hours there. So potentially Alliance members or exec \nhaving office hours there. \n \nInterviewer: What kind of space do you think would be most effective for this kind of center? \n \nParticipant: Something comfortable and cozy. So, like couches… Maybe like a TV, board games, \nsimilar to the OASIS house. \n \nInterviewer: So like a house or a building or an office or an entire floor?  \n \nParticipant: An entire floor would be lovely. \n \nInterviewer: Where on campus do you think it should be placed? \n \nParticipant: Somewhere central to campus so that it’s easy to get to. It would be cool if it was \nin the Foisie Innovation studio but I don’t know how that works. But somewhere central to \ncampus. \n \nInterviewer: Alright, thanks. \n  \n 44 \nInterview 6: \nInterviewer: How is campus climate around queer community members and issues? \n \nParticipant: I think that it’s very good compared to what I’m used to. \n \nInterviewer: Do you care to explain? \n \nParticipant: Nobody’s going around saying, “you’re going to burn and die in hell”. So, that’s, \nlike, a plus. So, that’s pretty great. \n \nInterviewer: Pretty good base level. \n \nParticipant: Yeah. Generally people are very very accepting and that’s pretty nice. Pretty great. \n \nInterviewer: What do you know about resources on campus currently available to queer \ncommunity members? \n \nParticipant: So, I know that there’s the Alliance. You are the president of that. \n \nInterviewer: That’s me. \n \nParticipant: That’s you. Uhm, there’s the SDCC and the Safe Space stickers on people’s doors \nand places like that. \n \nInterviewer: If there were a queer resource center on campus, would you go there? \n \nParticipant: All the time. \n \nInterviewer: Why? \n \nParticipant: Because it would be a place where I can just be gay. \n \nInterviewer: What could WPI do to better provide for its queer community members? \n \nParticipant: Have a queer resource center on campus. \n \nInterviewer: If there was a queer resource center on campus, what resources would you expect \nto be available? \n 45 \n \nParticipant: A place where the community can go with the recent political discussions going on \nsurrounding the queer community. We would be able to just be free of all of that. Even though \nthe community at WPI is very accepting, the queer community at WPI is 100% accepting. So, we \nwould all be able to just be in our little space. \n \nInterviewer: What services or amenities would you expect to be available? \n \nParticipant: Study space. Hotline resources in case people had any mental health problems. \nDirect connections to the SDCC because statistically the queer community has a high mental \nhealth… \n \nInterviewer: Prevalence? \n \nParticipant: Yeah. \n \nInterviewer: Incident rate? \n \nParticipant: Yeah, I would say mental health rate. \n \nInterviewer: How would you expect it to be staffed? \n \nParticipant: Either with people who are already staff or faculty members on campus who are of \nthe community or strong allies of the community or bring in new staff or faculty that are of or \nstrong allies to the community. Also, people who have training in handling situations where a \nperson who - let’s take for instance myself. for example. where I come from a very strong \nbackground of a family life where not everybody loves you because of who you are. So, dealing \nwith that psychologically people would have to take that into account and be able to know that \nthat is what that student is going through and they would have to be able to handle situations \nlike that. If, say, a student like me were to ever get out of hand emotionally or mentally. \nMentally unstable. \n \nInterviewer: What kind of space do you think would be most effective for this sort of center? \nLike a small space like an office or like a whole building? \n \nParticipant: Probably a small house. Just off campus. That way you’re still in the campus \ncommunity but far enough that it’s almost escaping the atmosphere of, like, if it’s during finals \nweek, you’re escaping the atmosphere of, “I have to do everything right now!” pressures and \n 46 \nyou could just relax, be yourself, study. It would be a nice little space to, you know, play games \nand get your mind off things. Life, whatever. \n  \n 47 \nAppendix B: Pronoun Interviews \nInterview 1: \nInterviewer: First question, what pronouns do you use? \n \nParticipant: I use they/them theirs. \n \nInterviewer: Why do you prefer to use these pronouns? \n \nParticipant: Because gender is a void. No, because I have gone back and forth a lot about \ngender in the past four years of my life and so they/them/theirs is just what I’m most \ncomfortable using with people. \n \nInterviewer: Have you ever used another student on this campus to use these pronouns? \n \nParticipant: Yes. \n \nInterviewer: How did it go? \n \nParticipant: Sometimes especially with people more… Who aren’t cis-het… It tends to go over a \nlot better. Some people, specifically different clubs that I’m in, it can be a little more \nnonresponsive to the suggestion. I’ve had friends who also identify as nonbinary and we’ve, in \nsome of the clubs that we’ve been in asked people to respect our pronouns they don’t \nnecessarily understand what we’re talking about and they don’t… Very few of them actually use \nthem. That might be because some of the people are new and then they hear the shitty people \nnot use pronouns so they just assume and we aren’t are confrontational about it… I guess as we \nwant to be. We just make sassy looks at each other. \n \nInterviewer: Alright, have you ever asked a faculty or staff member to use these pronouns? \n \nParticipant: Not a professor that I’ve had. I’ve had faculty that I’ve worked with on different \ncommittees that I’ve asked to use they/them/theirs pronouns for me. But, that’s with varying \nsuccess. \n \nInterviewer: Do you generally feel safe or welcome in the WPI community? \n \nParticipant: Generally, I feel okay about WPI. Not, generally, about trans and nonbinary issues \nthat I’ve had to deal with personally. \n \n 48 \nInterviewer: What would make you feel more safe or welcomed here in the WPI community? \n \nParticipant: I think a lot of what the negative responses I’ve gotten is simply due to lack of \nknowledge and lack of training. So, I feel like if more people understood things about trans and \nnonbinary issues I think it would be a lot better community and more open to people who \nidentify because I know that’s a large problem. Especially with incoming students. So, just more \nof an emphasis on it on campus as a whole I think would make things significantly improved. \n \nInterviewer: Cool, thank you! \n \nInterview 2: \nInterviewer: This first question is; what pronouns do you use? \n \nParticipant: I use she/her. \n \nInterviewer: Why do you prefer these pronouns? \n \nParticipant: Because I guess I identify as a girl. \n \nInterviewer: Have you ever asked another student on campus to use these pronouns \nspecifically? \n \nParticipant: Yes. \n \nInterviewer: So, how did it go? \n \nParticipant: Wait, what? \n \nInterviewer: Have you ever had to make that - go, like, “Hey”? \n \nParticipant: Oh! I thought you said if I asked someone else their pronouns. Oh, okay. \n \nInterviewer: So, have you? \n \nParticipant: No. \n \nInterviewer: Okay. Why not? \n \n 49 \nParticipant: Because people assumed she/her pronouns. \n \nInterviewer: Have you ever asked a faculty/staff member on this campus to go by these \npronouns in any specific way? \n \nParticipant: No. \n \nInterviewer: Do you generally feel safe or welcome in the WPI community? \n \nParticipant: Yes. \n \nInterviewer: In class, social spaces and all spaces? \n \nParticipant: Mostly. \n \nInterviewer: Okay, thank you. \n \nInterview 3: \nInterviewer: What pronouns do you use? \n \nParticipant: She/her/hers. \n \nInterviewer: Why do you prefer those pronouns? \n \nParticipant: Because they’re what I was raised with and it would be confusing to try and use \nanything else at this point for me. \n \nInterviewer: Have you ever asked another student on this campus to use these pronouns? \n \nParticipant: Yes, I have. \n \nInterviewer: How did it go? \n \nParticipant: It was respected and kind of understood. \n \nInterviewer: Have you ever asked a faculty/staff member on this campus to use these \npronouns? \n \n 50 \nParticipant: Yes. \n \nInterviewer: How’d that go? \n \nParticipant: It went fine. It was as expected. \n \nInterviewer: Do you generally feel safe or welcome in the WPI community? \n \nParticipant: Yes. \n \nInterviewer: Class, social spaces, et cetera? \n \nParticipant: Yes. \n \nInterviewer: Oh, okay. \n \nInterview 4: \nInterviewer: What pronouns do you use? \n \nParticipant: I use they/them or he/him. \n \nInterviewer: Why do you prefer these pronouns? \n \nParticipant: Because growing up I’ve never felt connected to the pronouns that I was given at \nbirth. \n \nInterviewer: Have you ever asked another student on this campus to use those pronouns? \n \nParticipant: Yes, I have. \nInterviewer: How’d it go? \n \nParticipant: It depended on the student, but more or less most of the students have been very \naccepting. Very accepting. More so than any students from where I’m from. \n \nInterviewer: Have you ever asked a faculty or staff member to use these pronouns? \n \nParticipant: RA’s count as faculty members, right? \n \n 51 \nInterviewer: Like, staff? \n \nParticipant: Or staff members. \n \nInterviewer: I think they count as staff. \n \nParticipant: So, then yes. \n \nInterviewer: How’d that go? \n \nParticipant: It went very well. Better than I expected. \n \nInterviewer: Do you generally feel safe or welcome in the WPI community? \n \nParticipant: Yes! \n \nInterviewer: In class, social spaces and all spaces on campus? \n \nParticipant: Yes. \n \nInterviewer: Cool, that’s the end. \n  \n 52 \nAppendix C: Resource Center Proposal \n“The Safe Zone” Proposal \nBased on data and experiences of the team, this is the proposed Mission Statement of the \nResource Center: \n \nThe Safe Zone works in conjunction with the Safe Zone Committee and The Alliance to \nchampion our celebration of diversity. We exist to create a safer campus for individuals of \nmarginalized genders and sexualities. We teach the values of understanding, acceptance, and \nvisibility to enrich the social awareness of our college. We provide vital resources, physical \nmeeting spaces, and occasional events to support those that need them.   \n \nSpace Specifications \n● Minimum Dimensions: \n○ One room, 28’ X 32’ \n● Ideal Dimensions: \n○ A house with two floors of usable space, for example, the OASIS House \n○ Would ideally have access to a gender neutral single stall shower \n● Space non-negotiables \n○ Must have handicap accessible gender neutral single stall bathroom \n○ Must be wired for ethernet connections and have power outlets \n○ Must be within a ten minute walking distance from the center of WPI’s main \ncampus \n● Visual of a potential layout of minimum space: \n 53 \n \n \nContents \nBelow is a list of minimum furnishings and contents required for the resource center to be able \nto open its doors. \nNote: These are only estimated costs. There is also potential for these items to be borrowed or \nshifted from other locations across campus. \nMinimum Furnishings \nNumber Needed Item Total Cost \n1 Computer Workstation \n(desktop, monitor, keyboard, \nmouse) \n$600 \n1 Printer (with scanning and \nfaxing capabilities) \n$100 \n1 Couch (large enough to seat \nthree people) \n$400 \n1 Television (at least 32”) $300 \n- The Alliance Library $0 - Moved from the OASIS \n 54 \nHouse \n2 Medium-sized bookshelves $200 \nSubscription Based Newspapers/Periodicals/Mag\nazines \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wik\ni/List_of_LGBT_periodicals#U\nnited_States) \nSubscription Based \n50 of each Brochures (Planned \nParenthood, Fenway Health, \nAIDS Project Worcester, \nSDCC) \n$0 \n1 Computer Desk $200 \n1 Computer Chair $50 \n1 Round Wooden Table (at \nleast 4 feet in diameter) \n$150 \n4 Wooden Chairs $200 \n \nAs more funding is acquired here is a list of additional items that would be beneficial for a \nlarger space. It is also important to keep in mind that this is not a finite list. Other furnishings \nthat the employees or users of the space display a need for should be promptly added or \npurchased. \n \nAdditional Furnishings \nNumber Needed Item Total Cost \n4 Bean Bag Chairs  $150 \n1 5’X8’ Rug $75 \n1 Bulletin Board (at least 2’X3’) $50 \n1 White Board (at least 2’X3’) $50 \n1 Coffee Maker (complete with \nan assortment of K-Cups) \n$150 \n 55 \n \n \nStaffing \n● Minimum Staffing \n○ Position: Student Employee (3) \n■ Part-time \n■ Minimum wage \n■ Each student is responsible for opening the center and running it either \nMonday, Tuesday, or Friday for 3 hours, 5-8PM \n● They would also be responsible for the operation of the center \noutside of its normal hours in the case of events that are \nadvertised and run by these employees in conjunction with \nmembers of the alliance \n■ Would typically be a member of The Alliance to be able to hold office \nhours during their shift \n● Ideal Staffing \n○ Position: Director (1) \n■ Full-time \n■  $50,000 per year salary (subject to change) \n■ Responsibilities: \n● Supervises the other employees of the resource center  \n● Writing and applying to grants \n● Looking for professional conferences to send students to \n● Making various schedules for the center  \n● Brainstorming potential events \n○ Position: Associate Director (1) \n■ Part-time \n■ $25 per hour (subject to change) \n■ Resposibilities: \n● Assisting the director in their endeavors \n● Serving as the bridge between the SafeZone Committee and the \nresource center \n● Attending professional conferences to establish \nrelationships/networking \n 56 \n○ Position: Program Coordinator (1) \n■ Part-time \n■ $25 per hour (subject to change) \n■ Responsibilities: \n● Frequently posting to the center’s social media \n● All forms of advertising for the center \n● Organizing and running all planned events \n○ Position: Student Employee (5) \n■ Is a member of The Alliance \n■ Part-time (could potentially be a federal work study) \n■ Minimum wage \n■ Responsibilities: \n● Holding office hours during their shift \n● Helping run any events \n● Supervising the space itself \n \n***It is important to note that all of these staff members do not need to be hired at once. For \nexample, in the first year of the Safe Zone’s operation just three student employees would \nsuffice. In the second year the Director position can be filled. In the third year two more \nstudent employees can be hired. In the fourth year a Program Coordinator can be hired. The \nlast position that should be filled is the Associate Director. Responsibilities of the unfilled \npositions will shift to the student employees and the Director. \n  \n 57 \nMinimum Safe Zone A-Term Schedule \n Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday \n9-10AM      \n10-11AM      \n11AM-12PM      \n12-1PM      \n1-2PM      \n2-3PM      \n3-4PM      \n4-5PM      \n5-6PM Student 1  Student 2  Student 3 \n6-7PM Student 1  Student 2  Student 3 \n7-8PM Student 1  Student 2  Student 3 \n \n  \n 58 \nIdeal Safe Zone A-Term Schedule \n Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday \n9-10AM Director, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \n10-11AM Director, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \n11AM-12PM Director, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector \n12-1PM Director, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \n1-2PM Director, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \n2-3PM Director, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \n3-4PM Director, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \n4-5PM Director, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \nDirector, \nAssociate \nDirector, \nProgram \nCoordinator \n 59 \n5-6PM Program \nCoordinator, \nStudent 1 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 2 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 3 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 4 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 5 \n6-7PM Program \nCoordinator, \nStudent 1 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 2 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 3 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 4 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 5 \n7-8PM Program \nCoordinator, \nStudent 1 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 2 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 3 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 4 \nProgram \nCoordinator, \nStudent 5 \n \nBudget \nMockup budget for one fiscal year based on the OMA 2016-2017 sample budget \nAccount Title Accounted Budget \nMiscellaneous Gifts 0.00 \nStudent Wages 10,000.00 \nSupplies (Events, Participants) 4,000.00 \nPostage/ Mailing Costs 15.00 \nStationary 250.00 \nPrinting 200.00 \nProfessional Services 1,000.00 \nTravel Expense - Domestic 5,000.00 \nFood 500.00 \nSubscriptions 300.00 \nBudget total 21,265.00 \n \n \n \nVisibility and Advertisement \n 60 \n● WPI email address: thesafezone@wpi.edu \n● Social Media Handles \n○ Twitter: @TheSafeZoneWPI \n○ Instagram: TheSafeZoneWPI \n○ Snapchat: TheSafeZoneWPI \n○ Facebook Page: The Safe Zone at Worcester Polytechnic Institute \n● Social Media login credentials \n○ Username: TheSafeZoneWPI (subject to change) \n○ Password: TheAlliance (subject to change) \n \n \nLogo Mockup \nShould be used as profile picture for all social media \n \n 61 \nWebsite Mockup\n \n \n \nEvents \nMockup of A Term Events \nAug 24  Student Activities Fair, 3pm-5pm, Quadrangle \nTabling is fun.

    "abstract": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is home to a thriving LGBTQIAP+ community. However, there currently is no physical location on campus where this population can go to get access to critical resources. Furthermore, those within that community who do not identify on either side of the spectrum of gender, face a unique set of issues with regards to preferred pronoun usage by peers. A general survey was distributed across campus to gage familiarity with the LGBTQIAP+ community. Interviews were conducted both to document experiences with using preferred pronouns in social settings and gather suggestions for the details of an LGBTQIAP+ resource center. From the collected data, a gender neutral pronoun training was written and a proposal for an LGBTQIAP+ resource center was drafted",
