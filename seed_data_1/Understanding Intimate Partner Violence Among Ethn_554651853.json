Based on an intersectional approach, the study highlightsand discusses how having multiple minority positions may inform and affect the wayparticipants experience IPV. The analysis shows that participants’ experiences ofIPV are shaped by their multiple minority statuses in Norwegian society. A discussionis provided that revolves around how being a sexual as well as an ethnic minority gen-erates a significant power imbalance for the participants in their relationships.Keywordsintimate partner violence, queer women, intersectionality, minority stress, ethnicminorities1Department of Social Work, Faculty of Social Sciences, VID Specialized University, Oslo, Norway2Early Childhood Education, Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway3Department of Interdisciplinary Studies of Culture, Eastern Norway Research Institute, Inland NorwayUniversity of Applied Sciences & NTNU, Trondheim, NorwayCorresponding Author:Esra Ummak, Department of Social Work, Faculty of Social Sciences, VID Specialized University,Diakonveien 14, 0370 Oslo, Norway.Email: esra.ummak@vid.noOriginal Research ArticleViolence Against Women1–26© The Author(s) 2022Article reuse guidelines:sagepub.com/journals-permissionsDOI: 10.1177/10778012221147912journals.sagepub.com/home/vawThe World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes intimate partner violence (IPV) asa global health concern that causes severe and negative mental and physical health out-comes among both heterosexual and queer individuals (WHO, 2010). IPV has beenproposed to include “behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical,sexual or psychological harm, including acts of physical aggression, sexual coercion,psychological abuse and controlling behaviours” (Heise & Garcia-Moreno, 2002,p. 89). It may also take the form of material and economic violence, a type ofcontrol over a partner’s “ability to acquire, use and maintain economic resources,thus threatening her economic security and potential for self-sufficiency” (Adamset al., 2008, p. 564; see also Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and FamilyAffairs [Bufdir], 2021). IPV may further be understood as behavior that “instils fearor offense, and in this way makes the person to do something against her will, or todiscontinue doing something that is in accordance with her will” (Isdal, 2000,p. 36), thus reducing the autonomy of the person. While research on IPV in heterosex-ual couples reveals a large variance in prevalence across cultures (WHO, 2010), theincreasing, albeit still few, number of studies on IPV in queer relationships indicatea higher prevalence of IPV among queer women, especially compared to their hetero-sexual counterparts (e.g., Blosnich & Bossarte, 2009; Messinger, 2011).Social policies regarding IPV influenced by the still-prominent second-waveWestern feminist approach starting in 1970s have attempted to understand violencein general, reflecting and reproducing the heteronormative understandings of society.In this direction, researchers have positioned “men” as the active agents of violenceand “women” as passive receivers or sufferers (Millett, 1971). Consequently, the com-monly held assumption that IPV stems from the duality of women and men, and thatthe passive recipients of male violence are the ones who are married women/spouseswithin the family system, maintains the invisibility of the IPV between queer individ-uals. Research on IPV thus has been increasingly criticized for its dependence on con-ceptual binaries such as man/woman and agency/victimhood (see also Haaken, 2010).Eschewing such duality, we acknowledge and argue that there can be a power imbal-ance or struggle, constitutive of violence, in queer relationships. Given the increasingvisibility of queer forms of relationships, there is a need to increase our knowledge andawareness of the different forms of violence occurring in such relationships.Although IPV has been an important field of study across disciplines, there is indeed aconsiderable absence of research that focuses on IPV among queer people (Calton et al.,2016; Stubberud & Eggebø, 2020; West, 2002). As available studies indicate, varioustypes of IPV do occur among partners across gender and sexual identities, and there isan urge for further research tohighlight and analyze howsexualminority status shapes vio-lence experiences. Failing towiden the scopewhen it comes to howweperceive and studyIPVputs queer individuals at risk, especially queer individualswithmultiple forms of soci-etal marginalization (e.g., queer women from ethnic minority backgrounds) (Fountain &Skolnik, 2007). Therefore, we suggest that IPV among queer individuals should be under-stood through intersectional lenses to move beyond single-axis explanations of violenceand focus on how, for instance, “race,” sexual identity, sexual orientation, immigrantstatus, and economic status may intersect and inform experiences of IPV.2 Violence Against Women 0(0)Accordingly, in this study, we focused specifically on how queer women fromminority backgrounds in Norway understand and experience IPV. Queer women inthis study included individuals with the gender identity of cis-woman and sexual ori-entation of lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, demisexual, etc. We also discuss how the cul-tural politics of immigration in Norway can be important in these personal experiences.Understanding the unique characteristics of IPV among queer women from ethnicminority backgrounds may help identify alternate pathways for research and interven-tion for members of such marginalized groups. The results can also be beneficial forpolicy makers in adopting broader and more inclusive measures for protectionagainst IPV.IPV in NorwayExperiences of IPV may exacerbate mental health problems in the lesbian, gay, bisex-ual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) population, who have been shown in severalstudies to suffer from disproportionate rates of mental health problems compared tothe general population in multiple countries (Frisch et al., 2019; Mink et al., 2014).In Norway, several studies have documented the negative experiences LGBTQpersons encounter compared to the larger heterosexual population. Roland andAuestad (2009) reported for instance that 36% gay youth had been exposed tomobbing compared to 6% of heterosexual youth. According to Fladmoe et al.(2019), LGBTQ persons reported to a larger degree having experienced hateful com-ments (23% compared to 10% in the larger population) and concrete threats (15% com-pared to 4% in the larger population). In addition, Eggebø et al. (2018) reported thatLGTBQ persons with immigrant background may be vulnerable to discriminationand stereotyping in complex ways due to their multiple minority identities. Overall,the share of LGBTQ individuals reporting mental health challenges, such as depressionand anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts or attempts is considerably largerthan among heterosexuals. Thirty-six percentage of LGBTQ individuals report symp-toms of mental health problems, compared to 18% of the general public (Bufdir, 2021).Furthermore, LGBTQ individuals can be seen as an at-risk group in connection to IPV,in terms of both potential exposure and mental health outcomes. However, in Norway,there have been only a few studies focusing on IPV in the LGBTQ population (Fjæret al., 2013; Hesselberg, 2011). Although these studies document the fact that IPVin LGBTQ population occurs, they provide very little or no information about the prev-alence of IPV and salience within LGBTQ population in general and among those withimmigrant background in particular. While Stubberud and Eggebø (2020) reportvarious forms of violence queer immigrants in Norway experience, including hatecrime, racism, and honor-related violence by family, they acknowledge the lack ofresearch on IPV especially. This lack of knowledge is also pointed out by theNorwegian shadow report to the Istanbul Convention (2020), which states that diver-sity is poorly addressed in existing violence research in Norway, and additionalresearch on violence against and among LGBTQ individuals has not been completedas planned in the most recent national action plan against violence (NorskUmmak et al. 3Skyggerapport – Istanbulkonvensjonen, 2020). According to the report, there is a par-ticular lack of data when it comes to mapping queer women’s experiences of violence.Thus, the paucity of research on IPV among queer women in Norway is a significantobstacle to creating evidence-based policies, outreach, and programs targeting theissue.Minority StressThe theory of minority stress is a conceptual framework developed to understandstressors embedded in the social position of gender and sexual minorities, and theirrelation to mental health challenges such as depressive symptoms, suicide ideation,substance abuse, etc. (Meyer, 2003).From a minority stress theory perspective, queers can experience distress due tothe stigma and prejudice based on their gender and sexual identities. Furthermore,minority stress might be experienced differently among queers based on membershipof other social identity categories (i.e., race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.). In otherwords, the variation of experiences of stress within the queer population might beunderstood by differential stress exposures, such as racism and sexism. In additionto mental health problems, the combined stressors of heterosexism and racismcould create unique vulnerabilities for psychosocial challenges, such as IPV(Finneran & Stephenson, 2014).Intersecting Identities: Being a Queer Woman of an EthnicMinority in NorwayThe framework of intersectionality has been utilized as an analytical perspective tomake sense of the multidimensional aspects of oppression and individual experi-ences in which one simultaneously accommodates several socially constructedminority categories such as race, class, gender, and ethnicity. For instance,Crenshaw (1989), who is credited with coining the term, argued that the existinglegal system, at that particular time in the United States, failed to capture howracism and sexism simultaneously contribute to the oppression of black women.Cole (2009), arguing for the importance of understanding the relationship of race/ethnicity, gender, social class, and sexuality on outcomes such as mental healthand wellbeing, suggests that psychologists conceptualize the influences of multiplesocial categories in their research. From an intersectionality perspective, race,gender, social class, sexuality, and other social categories are construed to influencegroups’ access to social, economic, and political resources and privileges, as they“encapsulate historical and continuing relations of political, material, and socialinequality and stigma” (Cole, 2009, p. 173). In addition, Mahalingam (2007) char-acterizes intersectionality in terms of the “interplay between person and social loca-tion, with particular emphasis on power relations among various social locations”(p. 45), drawing our attention to the ways in which multiple category membershipsposition individuals and groups in asymmetrical relation to one another. This implies4 Violence Against Women 0(0)an understanding of individuals as embedded in cultural and historical contexts,which not only may affect the way they perceive and experience life but also struc-ture what outcomes are available to them.While LGBTQ status is socially stigmatized in societies that have predominantlyheteronormative cultures, other social statuses (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender) can interactwith it to create increasingly unequal mental health outcomes (Mink et al., 2014; Khanet al., 2017). Within the context of IPV in which the partner is a majority member, itmay be expected that having multiple minority identities could compound the effects ofdiscrimination, cultural bias, stigma, and intolerance with the effects of abuse in theintimate sphere. Intersectionality demands that we consider how subjective experi-ences of structural inequalities and stigma can be constitutive of mental health out-comes among multiple marginalized social groups.When studying the experiences and understandings of IPV for queer women fromethnic minority backgrounds, we seek to capture how these identities (being an ethnicand sexual minority) intersect and shape the IPV experiences of this particular groupin the particular context of Norway. In doing so, we also aim to highlight the multifac-eted power dynamics operating in IPV instances that are specific to these minorities. Forexample, legal regulations and practices regarding the rights of LGBTQ people areadvanced in Norway compared to many other nations (Bufdir, 2014). Furthermore,using the current Rainbow Index published by the European Region of theInternational Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (ILGA-Europe,2020), Norway ranks 4th (69.89% on a scale of 0–100) in terms of respect for thehuman rights of LGBTQ individuals. Nonetheless, some LGBTQ people from ethnicminorities in Norway might feel rejected by the mainstream gay community, wherethey might face racism and a lack of acceptance of their values and attitudes (Bufdir,2014). Furthermore, having at least two minority statuses—that is, as women in patriar-chal cultures and as queer women in heteronormative societies—may result in augment-ing minority stress (Szymanski & Kashubeck-West, 2008). At this point, queer women(e.g., women with a non-normative sexual orientation) are more likely than others tobecome victims of violence, and ethnic minorities are particularly vulnerable in thecontext of IPV (Bufdir, 2014).The lack of research on IPV in queer relationships in general in Norway, withlimited exception (e.g., Fjær et al., 2013; Hesselberg, 2011), and the lack of researchspecifically in queer relationships in which one partner is a minority member(Stubberud & Eggebø, 2020) provide justification to do more research to grasp the phe-nomenon of IPV in queer relations. Here, we are specifically interested in capturing thelived experiences of queer women from ethnic minority backgrounds in Norwaythrough an intersectional approach to IPV. We aim to widen our understanding andcontribute to the research field by using a qualitative approach.MethodsOur research orientation was qualitative, and we chose semi-structured interview as themain method of data collection. Kvale (1996) suggests that semi-structured interviewsUmmak et al. 5may work as a way of performing a planned yet flexible conversation, which providesthe possibility of gathering data about the life worlds of participants and interpretingmeanings attached to phenomena described by them. The first author conducted allinterviews, which lasted approximately 1.5 h each. All interviews were conducted inEnglish.Throughout the research process, we discussed how, in addition to epistemologicalreflexivity, our positionality might inform the study and provide insights to analyzingthe data, as suggested by Willig (2013). For instance, all three authors are immigrantsin Norway, coming from a Middle Eastern country. Two of the authors identify asqueer. To illustrate further, the first author who conducted the interviews experiencedto have established the necessary rapport, the comfortable safe space in an interviewsituation where participants can speak freely and openly (Willig, 2013), with theparticipants.ParticipantsWe recruited nine participants by distributing a poster with information about thestudy and the criteria for participation through email groups of established networksand NGOs working for LGBTQ rights (such as Skeiv Verden, FRI, and Salaam) inNorway. Thus, our sample is a convenience sample of only those who were inter-ested in the study got in touch with us. Criteria for selection included (a) volitionalparticipation, (b) age of 18 years or older, (c) identifying as a queer woman (i.e.,gender identity of cis-woman and sexual orientation of lesbian, bisexual, pansexual,etc.) who has engaged in relationships with women (i.e., cis, non-binary, trans, etc.),(d) having experienced a violent romantic relationship (i.e., dating, cohabiting,engaged, or married), and (e) having migration background in Norway. We willuse the following culturally appropriate pseudonyms for our participants: Esin,Eirinn, Elena, Agnes, Nadiya, Dilan, Sinem, Aru, and Yasemen. Six of participantshad immigrated to Norway as adults (length of stay ranging from two to 12 years)except Eirinn, Dilan and Aru, who were born in Norway to immigrant parents.Participants or their families had migrated from countries in Africa, Middle East,and Eastern Europe. All identified themselves as queer women, except Yasemen,who identified as non-binary. The mean age of our participants was 33 years(range: 25–42 years). All had been in at least one romantic relationship in whichthey experienced IPV (Table 1).ProcedureThematic analysis (TA) as outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006, 2019) is utilized tomake sense of the collected data. Doing TA implies looking at data at a latent level,allowing researchers to generate themes: “patterns of shared meaning, underpinnedby a central meaning-based concept” (Braun & Clarke, 2019, p. 593) in what isreported by the participants. Reflexivity underpins any methodological choice andrelates to “ways in which a researcher’s involvement with a particular study influence,6 Violence Against Women 0(0)acts upon and informs such research” (Nightingale & Cromby, 1999, p. 228). We adopta constructionist position and aim to interpret and relate data to the most salient dis-courses, social, and structural elements of a society. Within this position lies an impli-cation of an ontological acceptance of the possibility of multiple socially constructedrealities and truth claims, coupled with an epistemological dependence relating to waysin which participants and we as researchers mutually construct meanings (Head &Milton, 2014; see also Willig, 2013).We followed a stepwise process as suggested by Braun and Clarke (2006). First,interviews were transcribed verbatim and anonymized in line with the ethical stan-dards set forth by the Norwegian Center for Research Data, which approved theconduct of the current study. Second, each coauthor coded three separate inter-views on their own, creating an initial code list. Then, the codes we each suggestedfrom this initial phase were compared to those coded by the other two coauthors bygathering codes in a common code book. At this stage, each coauthor read all inter-views to become more familiar with the data. We held meetings to generate furthercodes and or refine the codes from the initial phase. After through discussionsregarding the data and our positionality (our immigrant background, sexual iden-tity and orientation, and academic and epistemological considerations), wereached a consensus about the common themes, which are reported in the nextsection.ResultsIn line with our research questions, we will first present how our participants under-stand and define IPV. We will then turn to ways in which they make sense of theirIPV experiences, also detailing from an intersectional perspective how their experi-ences are necessarily embedded within and permeated and informed by the widersocial and societal context (Table 2).Table 1.

Within this broad conceptualization, they illus-trated four forms of abuse that they had experienced related to IPV: physical, sexual,economic, and psychological. Elena, one of the participants, defines IPV as “basicallyanything that is done by a partner toward the other partner to show dominance in termsof relationship standard.”We should emphasize that although these four forms of abuseare conceptually distinct and thus are categorized in our analysis as different themes,they might, from our participants’ point of view, be experientially overlapping. AsEirinn illustrates, the line between different forms of abuse might not always be clear-cut: “during sex or whatever, she would scratch me so hard, I would start bleeding, and,like, I never consented to that.” Eirinn experienced an unwanted sexual act that resultedin bodily harm. Physical violence in our participants’ talk related to actions byex-partners that could cause the participant some form of bodily harm. Hitting,pushing against the wall, and scratching were the most mentioned forms by our par-ticipants. Sexual violence was described in different ways, from unwanted physicallyviolent sex to transmitting sexual disease to a partner or having unprotected sex withothers while hiding it from one’s partner. Although economic violence was construedas a form of abuse by several of our participants, they did not elaborate on this. Somerelated this to the fact that their partner “stole money” from them or that their partnerwould “deny them access to their own money” (Esin). Some illustrated economic vio-lence in relation to a power imbalance between themselves and their abusiveex-partners.Psychological violence, however, was the most predominant type of IPV that ourparticipants defined. This finding resonates with previous research (Badenes-Riberaet al., 2015; Head & Milton, 2014). In addition to a higher prevalence rate, psycholog-ical abuse can lead to a higher rate of retrospective reporting because of the challengingnature of the symptoms, such as diminished self-esteem (Head & Milton, 2014). Thismay explain why participants predominantly define violence in terms of psychologicalabuse.Our participants construed psychological violence in various ways, detailing howthis kind of violence both reflects and feeds into the established power imbalance inTable 2. Defining Intimate Partner Violence.Type ofviolence Example quotePhysical “Hitting and pushing against the wall.” (Agnes, 40)Sexual “Transmitting sexual disease to a partner or having unprotected sex withothers while hiding it from one’s partner.” (Eirinn, 26)Economic “Deny the partner access to their own money.” (Esin, 42)Psychological “Degrading, putting down, and making feel worthless.” (Sinem, 32)8 Violence Against Women 0(0)the relationships, with the result that our participants’ well-being was severelydamaged. One commonly mentioned form was passive aggression, understood byour participants as ignoring their partner’s needs and emotions and pullingback. Passive-aggressive treatment could involve silent treatment, “usingpassive-aggressive eyerolling,” or “other ways of … making [the] other … feelbad without directly making them feel bad,” as Agnes puts it. Manipulation, isolat-ing, and mood swings were other quite common themes in our participants’ accountsof psychological violence. Gaslighting as a form of severe psychological manipula-tion can be illustrated by the words of Eirinn, who describes how the abusive party“fucks with another party’s perception of reality … [and] degrades or questions theother person’s mental faculties.” Such manipulation may result in self-doubt anddiminished belief in one’s own judgment (Head & Milton, 2014). Gaslightingmay indeed result in sustaining violence as the victim is constrained from comingto terms with the abuse they are exposed to, limiting their power to seek institutionalprotection (Sweet, 2019).Several participants emphasized control as a sort of psychological violence. Controlis construed as monitoring and limiting the activities of one’s partner, especially socialactivities involving other people. For instance, Nadiya experienced this to the degreethat their partner would be “dictating what [they] should wear, what should [they]do, who [they] socialize with [and] don’t socialize with.” Such control may lead to aform of alienation, stripping the person of individuality and agency (Dichter et al.,2018). Aru understands such control as “a violation of trust and privacy” and relatesit to, for instance, jealousy by their partner: “They do it because they get reallyjealous…Like checking who you are with. And maybe there’s an extra anxiety forlesbian relationships because women are naturally friends with other women, and sothat complicates it.” Aru elaborates that jealousy can be particularly complicated inqueer women’s relationships, leading to a larger control issue and thus creatingmore anxiety for queer women.Several of the participants emphasized denigration as a sort of psychological vio-lence. Esin clearly states that “underestimating them, telling them ‘Oh, you becameso fat’ is violence.” Descriptions such as degrading, putting down, and making feelworthlesswere used by our participants. Such attempts might be related to a dominancestrategy by the abusive partners, who wish to gain more control over their partners. AsSinem illustrates, the abusive partner might, in their attempt at “making a personsmall,” come up with insults such as “you are not good enough, you are not smartenough … you cannot do that….”Making Sense of IPVOur analysis produced five main themes that IPV experiences of our participants can bestructured around: (a) power imbalance as a result of intersecting roles in immigration,racial/ethnic minority status, and heteronormativity; (b) difficulty acknowledging vio-lence and feeling shame; (c) heterosexism and heteronormative discourse on IPV; (d)fighting back; and (e) childhood traumas, fear, and insecurity (Table 3).Ummak et al. 9Power Imbalance: Intersecting Roles of Immigration, Racial/Ethnic MinorityStatus, and HeteronormativityAs subjectivity—the way individuals think, feel, and act—is inevitably embedded inwider social and societal contexts, the IPV experiences of our participants are implic-itly and explicitly influenced by those wider contexts. Indeed, all our participants referto a power imbalance that “gives [their abusive partners] so much control over [theirTable 3. Making Sense of Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence.Themes Example quotePower Imbalance: Intersecting Roles ofImmigration, Racial/Ethnic Minority Status,and Heteronormativity“If it comes to my options, the immigrantcommunity is very heteronormative. Andthen, the others in the LGBTQ communityare very white…. Well, the way Iexperienced it is that when you go into agroup like that, it’s very obvious that you arethe different and more exotic person, with adifferent background and then it’s kind of,like, sort of expected that you somehowexplain it. I think it’s what I, how I experiencewhiteness, it is just that it becomes apparentthat you are different.” (Dilan, 27)Difficulty Acknowledging Violence andFeeling Shame“I feel like it’s like kind of taboo to say that, orto admit kind of like accepting these thingsalso, and especially to admit in a way like, thisis hurting me and I am letting it happen, andthen, like, people will hold you responsible,and, for your own thing or whatever.”(Eirinn, 26)Heterosexism and HeteronormativeDiscourse on IPV“In most queer relationships, the reasons tobecome violent are different. It’s not aboutseeking dominance, and of making thingshow they should be according to society, butmostly because of growing up and seeing thatyou are something that is not to be accepted,something that is bad. You develop a lot ofanger and trust issues that can come out inviolent ways in a relationship.” (Elena, 25)Fighting Back “…I normally don’t shout, but if I feel likesomeone is being aggressive toward me then,then I get very aggressive.” (Aru, 29)Childhood Traumas, Fear, and Insecurity “You know, when you are in love, the problemis you don’t see it. You know that you aretired but you don’t see it, because you all thetime think “I don’t want to be alone again.”(Yasemen, 37)10 Violence Against Women 0(0)lives],” as Esin puts it, and they make the case that such imbalance may be related to, bestrengthened and reproduced by socio-structural factors. More specifically, theygrapple with the ways in which their immigrant status, given the immigration policiesin Norway; their racial and ethnic background, given societal discourses regarding raceand ethnicity; and their sexual orientation, given the heteronormativity of society, mayfeed into the overall experience of IPV. To begin with, we traced an explicit attempt byour participants at negotiating their immigrant background, illustrating how being a lin-guistic, cultural, or racial minority in a white and heteronormative society might berelevant to making sense of IPV directly and indirectly. Generally, representing aminority and thus being “different” from the norm in multiple ways is experiencedas problematic:If it comes to my options, the immigrant community is very heteronormative. And then,the others in the LGBTQ community are very white…. Well, the way I experienced it isthat when you go into a group like that, it’s very obvious that you are the different andmore exotic person, with a different background and then it’s kind of, like, sort ofexpected that you somehow explain it. I think it’s what I, how I experience whiteness,it is just that it becomes apparent that you are different. (Dilan)The intersectional perspective we use may help us illustrate the ways in which ourparticipants experience problems. Dilan is forced into either a sexual minority positionin an immigrant community that is predominantly heteronormative or a cultural/racialminority position in an LGBTQ community that is predominantly “white.” The inter-sectional problem lies in the fact that it is complicated to be gay in a heteronormativegroup, as it means risking prejudice, homophobia, and “being kicked out” by familyand significant others (Agnes), and having to explain who you are as the “exoticother” (Dilan) adds to the strain. As Frankenberg (1993) argues, being white in pre-dominantly white cultures is taken for granted to the extent that it becomes invisible,while nonwhites become visible minorities that need to be accounted for, explained,and problematized.Merely being a visible minority may thus create a situation in which our participantscannot escape but face an implicit form of derogation. They may have to deal with feel-ings of inferiority and be exposed to racist discourse. According to Nadiya, “ethnicbackground makes everything more difficult.” While Eirinn, who had been exposedto various forms of physical, sexual, and psychological violence, had to also listento “racist shit [their ex] had said and done” and “endure [their] racial abuse,” Sinemstated that their partner used their racial and immigrant background to degrade andhumiliate them:They were always telling me, “You only got this position because you’re brown.” Like, Iwas asked to talk about something in a panel, and they were like, “Cause you’re brown.”Not because I’m this intellectual being … I’m never, like, an intellectual being ever inpeople’s eyes … like I’m someone’s brown experience. And yeah, it really fucked meup. (Sinem)Ummak et al. 11Such a racist discourse, where Sinem’s subjectivity is reduced to merely a represen-tative of a category, may not only strip her of all perceived intellectual abilities but alsocreate psychological problems for her. There is indeed vast literature on how racismnegatively influences psychological well-being (Harrell, 2000). For instance, Elgvinet al. (2013) documented how some LGBTQ people from ethnic minority backgroundsin Norway felt rejected by the mainstream gay community. Given the intersectionalityregarding immigrant background, gender, and sexual orientation, some LGBTQ peoplewith an immigrant background in Norway seem to have a higher risk of being margin-alized (Bufdir, 2021), which might lead to a power imbalance among queer couples.Esin, who came to Norway through marriage migration, narrated her IPV experi-ences as:She gave me the feeling of that I was never [good] enough…Like how I can do this, and Idid grow up in a village, and my race also, you know … she said, “You’re nothing to theNorwegian government and Norwegian police because, in the end, you are a black-headedTurkish woman. Who cares about you here if you get divorced from me? They will kickyou out of the country.” That was kind of also the threats, like “I will call the police; theywill come and take you.” (Esin)Esin reported having been exposed to various forms of physical, economic, and psy-chological violence, involving instances of being pushed and hit, receiving silent treat-ment, body shaming, and humiliation, as well as different types of threats related to herimmigration status and ethnic background. Her account illustrates well the intersec-tional experience, detailing the interrelatedness of different axes or forms of oppressionand how they are mutually constitutive in creating a vulnerable subjectivity. Esin’s pre-carious immigration status in Norway arguably became a constitutive element of herIPV experience. Talking about her migration status, she said:I believe [it] effects the violence dynamics between two women also—like, power as eco-nomic right. One is owning the country, and one is not… It gives them so much controlover your life, how you behave … it’s about the power… (Esin)Esin relates to and reflects on how her status as a migrant spouse creates a depend-ency on her Norwegian wife and thus a power imbalance in the relationship. Hence,structural, cultural, and economic elements of society may function in a way thatplaces Esin in an underprivileged position while providing the abusive partner witha great deal of control over her life. This intersectional experience can be further illus-trated by taking into account what Esin had experienced when she, as the foreignspouse, had sought help by calling the police to report severe physical violence:I called the police to report domestic violence, and I asked them to come and get me andtake me somewhere else because I was literally frozen, and I didn’t know what to do….And I called them next to my ex-wife, I spoke with a police officer in English, and sud-denly this police officer said, “Can I talk to your partner?” And I gave phone to mypartner…. Then the police officer talked to my ex-wife, and they started to laugh, or12 Violence Against Women 0(0)she started to laugh, at least. And then she hung up the phone, and she said, “They don’ttake you seriously because you can’t speak Norwegian.” (Esin)Esin’s account exemplifies the similar experiences among our participants. The factthat Esin came to Norway through marriage migration seems to establish a powerimbalance between her and her Norwegian wife, given that her residential status inNorway had been dependent on her marriage. The socio-structural elements ofNorwegian society, more specifically the bureaucratic rules around marriage migrationwith regulations to prevent pro-forma marriage, not only define a normative under-standing of what a so-called real intimate relationship should look like but also gener-ate a residential and economic dependence of the foreign spouse on the partner whoalready resides in Norway (Eggebø, 2010, 2013). We suggest that such dependency,that being the cultural and linguistic other, further disempowered our participant andbecame a constitutive part of her violent experience.The ethnic minority background of our participants seemed to create certain vulner-abilities for them, as it could be used against them as a means of control by their abusivepartners. It may be used against them as a threat, as Nadiya’s case exemplifies: “I gotthreats that [I am] gonna be reported to immigration authority, if I do that and that.”Beyond serving as a direct means of control, being the migrant spouse in the relationship,as some of our participants reported, made them dependent on their partners psycholog-ically as well as economically. Their dependency would vary according to “how longthey had lived in Norway” and whether they had “personal income,” a “Norwegiansupport system” or network of friends they could rely on if needed, their “immigrationstatuses,” and a “permanent residence permit.” Previous research has emphasized thatIPV, specifically victimization, affects queer people from racial/ethnic minority back-grounds disproportionately (Reuter et al., 2017; Whitton et al., 2019).In addition to difficulties caused by ethnic minority status, heteronormativity as anoverarching ideology of the society or an axis of sexual oppression may create furthervulnerabilities for queer people, feeding into their experiences of IPV. Not being ableto leave a violent relationship due to insecurities about being queer suggests that sexualminority status in a predominantly heteronormative society can structurally contributeto a higher degree of dependency in queer relationships.I think also because there’s a fear, maybe particularly in queer communities, and maybequeer with ethnic minority communities, that you cannot find someone to date, you know.There’s a lot of fear that you’ll be alone, that you won’t have a family. It’s hard to date, it’shard to find a companion. So, once you are in a relationship, you have a tendency to reallywant to hold on to that person, and that makes it even more vulnerable. Because it’s harderfor you to let go of a relationship once you’ve found it… (Aru)Difficulty Acknowledging Violence and Feeling ShameSeveral participants stated that it takes time for them to recognize their experiences asviolence. Agnes explains:Ummak et al. 13Things get like, really, really crazy. And you’re not able to realize it, what’s going on…Even though you know something is not right, but still try to convince yourself and justifythings… (Agnes)Agnes’ process of realization, grappling with the abuse by searching for justifica-tion, may illustrate how difficult it might be to acknowledge and accept victimhood.A lack of a frame of reference related to IPV among sexual minorities may lead to dif-ficulty acknowledging violence (Head & Milton, 2014). This process is perhaps com-plicated by the feeling of shame, as several of our participants state how difficult it isfor them to be open about it and talk to others because it is experienced as “uncomfort-able” and as “an embarrassment.” For instance,I feel like it’s like kind of taboo to say that, or to admit kind of like accepting these thingsalso, and especially to admit in a way like, this is hurting me and I am letting it happen,and then, like, people will hold you responsible, and, for your own thing or whatever.(Eirinn)Shame in same-sex relationships is frequently discussed in the context of IPV(Alsaker et al., 2016; Townsend & Bailey, 2021). Similar to the sense of shamerelated to the IPV in heterosexual relationships (Alsaker et al., 2016), queer womenin our study also linked the feeling of shame to the fact that they were not able toleave their partners.[I]t is quite embarrassing to admit something like that. To say I am in an abusive relation-ship and not leave. And it takes some time to understand that you are in abusive relation-ship… (Nadiya)The feeling of shame related to IPV might lead the victims to social isolation andhelplessness (Townsend & Bailey, 2021) and make queer women of ethnic minoritiesmore vulnerable in the context of seeking help.Heterosexism and Heteronormative Discourse on IPV. Queer women in our study mostlycontend that the heavily predominant heteronormative thinking regarding violence inintimate relationships contributes to concealing queer experiences of violence.Sinem for instance makes the claim that from a heteronormative perspective:When it comes to #metoo movements, there have been some, like, sexual violence or somuch more, that is like, I have to prove my sexuality, because my sexuality doesn’t exist,and therefore, I can never be like the victim of sexual abuse, in a way. And so, then nar-ratives are really, really bad, psychological violence is real, manipulation is real, but, andmainstream feminist will see all of these nuances when it comes to a man who’s doing it toa woman, and we, we tried to create a hashtag, like, queer too, me too, you know, try to,but it didn’t catch on. (Sinem)The quotation above illustrates how pervasive heteronormativity as an ideology ordiscourse might function as an alienation mechanism that invalidates, overlooks, and14 Violence Against Women 0(0)conceals various problems of queer existence. In a heteronormative society where thepower imbalance is only normalized between men and women, the suffering of queerwomen who experience violence and forms of harassment perpetuated by other womenis rendered invisible. Sinem argues that her experiences of violence in queer relation-ships are not recognized in a heteronormative society. She further raises a critique ofthe mainstream feminist movement that is not inclusive of issues regarding the IPVexperienced in queer relationships. Reflecting on similar experiences, Aru stated thatthere is a mainstream belief that “women can’t be oppressors” and that they cannotbe violent.The argument that dominant heteronormative discourse might make violence expe-rienced by queer women invisible is in line with established research (Irwin, 2008).Coupled with the stereotypical understanding of same-sex relationships as moregender-role free or more egalitarian (e.g., Hassouneh & Glass, 2008), heteronormativ-ity, to the degree that it is appropriated/internalized, may lead queer women to under-stand violence as primarily a heterosexual issue and thus make it more difficult toacknowledge what they experience as violence and consequently stay silent about it(Irwin, 2008). Regarding this issue, Aru states:I dated men before as well, and because they were men, I was even more aware, and if Isaw any signs of a violent behavior then I would … like, leave immediately. But withwomen, it was more difficult for me to see because my view of women was muchmore positive and reassuring, and I felt safe … so it was harder to see those signs … Ithink we have this misconception, and I have this as well, where I always see myselfas extremely considerate, but when I’m fighting with my partner, I see a different sideof myself that I have. It took me a long time to accept that I have this side, that I canbe the aggressor, and I can be manipulative, I can be all these things … (Aru)Aru’s reflection above relates to how internalization of heteronormative discourseon IPV by queer people might pose a huge problem, as it may contribute to concealingsuffering by queer women (Hesselberg, 2011; Ovesen, 2020). Equally important,however, is the argument by some of our participants that IPV in queer relationsshould be contextualized and understood in terms of growing up in a heterosexistculture. Esin, for instance, contemplates:I think it is so naive to say “Why a woman should hurt another woman?We are all woman.We should understand each other” … [b]ut we all grew up with heterosexual parents andmostly men power, then women can be like that, when they start to, when they are obligedto think like a man. I don’t mean like a man in a biological term…. Women can be soeasily violent to each other, also… (Esin)Esin elaborates on a widespread misconception about queer partnerships as egalitar-ian relationships. Referring to being brought up by heterosexual parents and exempli-fying how women might be “obliged to think like a man,” she argues that a powerimbalance inevitably generates a relationship dynamic which is heteronormative.However, how our participants relate IPV to heterosexism, which is conceptualizedUmmak et al. 15as societal devaluation of LGBTQ identities (Meyer, 2003), varies. Elena proposesanother point of departure:In most queer relationships, the reasons to become violent are different. It’s not aboutseeking dominance, and of making things how they should be according to society, butmostly because of growing up and seeing that you are something that is not to be accepted,something that is bad. You develop a lot of anger and trust issues that can come out inviolent ways in a relationship. (Elena)Here, Elena construes violent behavior as a reflection or outcome of the continuousothering that queer people experience. Lack of acceptance of who they are and/or beingvalued negatively by the majority might underpin the IPV experience. Heterosexismarguably creates various distal (i.e., experiences of discrimination) and proximal(i.e., internalized heterosexism) minority stress processes for sexual minorities(Meyer, 2003). Indeed, there is support in the research literature, showing the existenceof a relationship between internalized heterosexism and a higher risk of IPV (Balsam &Szymanski, 2005; Ummak et al., 2021). Consequently, we argue that our participantsmight be at higher risk of experiencing IPV given the exposure to such stressors and thedegree to which they internalize them. Aru narrated:My partner can’t meet my family, still hasn’t met my family, and it’s like a part of yoube[ing] excluded from the relationship. And that is a stressor, that’s something thataffects relationship dynamic … I think it brings out a lot of insecurities because you’reconstantly on guard, and you’re thinking about what other people think about you. Imean, in general as well, just being, just being afraid in the streets, feeling unsafe as awoman but also as a lesbian woman. All these things, all these insecurities, it affectsyou in your day-to-day… it makes you more impatient, it makes you angrier, and itmakes you sad and, you know, it definitely has an effect. If you happen to get in a conflictwith your partner, then all of those factors contribute, even though you’re fighting about,you know, the bread, you’re actually, you’re other bringing into it a lot of other stressors.(Aru)Aru’s reflection above relates to the “personal is political” mantra widespreadwithin critical segments of the social sciences, illustrating here that the dynamics ofintimate relations are inevitably embedded within and shaped by how society func-tions. Thus, heterosexism may create LGBTQ-specific factors (connection to theLGBTQ community, lack of supportive networks, etc.) contributing to overall IPVexperience for LGBTQ groups (see, for instance, Mason et al., 2014).Fighting BackAlthough every participant in our study clearly identifies their ex-partner as the perpe-trator and thus holds them responsible for the IPV they have experienced, some makethe case that they themselves might have acted in ways that may be considered violent.For instance, Nadiya negotiates their role in IPV, acknowledging that they themselves16 Violence Against Women 0(0)were violent sometimes. This would involve manipulation or passive-aggressivebehavior. However, they would not refer to themselves as perpetrators but ratherframe their acts as fighting back. In this regard, the following account is important:I would say that the character of that person was definitely waking the worse in me … Ifthere was not so much provocation or manipulation on her side, then I wouldn’t have to,like, manipulate from my own side. But I’m definitely not a person that would do some-thing violent… [I]n relationship with a person like that, I am not sure if it is just so easy tostay as an innocent observer or you just automatically become participant. You automat-ically kind of start to participate in this…. So, I wouldn’t say I was a perpetrator, butyou’re creating some kind of toolbox for how to get out of this dramatic episode withthe people like that. (Nadiya)Similarly, Aru reflected on their own aggressivity as a reaction:She grew up that way, and she had a lot of people that shouted at her, basically, and she’skind of adopted that behavior a bit, and I normally don’t shout, but if I feel like someone isbeing aggressive toward me then, then I get very aggressive. (Aru)In the accounts above, our participants narrated their acts of violence as self-defense or a reaction to being at the receiving end of violence. On the one hand, itcould be argued that they try to justify their own acts of violence as merely self-defense. On the other hand, it should be noted that developing a certain way ofreacting—“a toolbox,” as Nadiya puts it—might be exactly what is needed tosurvive in a violent relationship.Childhood Traumas, Fear, and Insecurity. In attempting to make sense of why IPV occursin their relationships and why it may be difficult to escape it, such as by ending therelationship, our participants refer to childhood traumas, fear, and insecurities ofboth themselves and their abusive partners. Either party in the relationship havingexperienced childhood trauma, physical, or sexual abuse is construed by some partic-ipants to have a bearing on their adult relationships. What the person, either the abuseror the victim, brings into the relationship in terms of negative life experiences, such aschildhood victimization, thus seems to present a greater risk for IPV. For instance, Arutries to make sense of the violence they experienced by referring to the traumatic pastand painful experiences she and her partner had:She’s also experienced a lot of violence in her upbringing. And we both have very differ-ent triggers, and we’ve come out of our situations in a very different way…And her pasttrauma and my past trauma is really affecting us, and we both of us have not gone con-sistently to therapist previously… (Aru)In Aru’s account, we witness a bridging between past traumas and IPV.Interestingly, she refers to a process of socialization in which her partner may havelearned how to be an abuser as she herself was abused. Indeed, Lockhart et al.Ummak et al. 17(1994) found that queer women who have experienced childhood victimization (i.e.,emotionally abused) report more vulnerability to verbal and physical abuse in theirrelationships. In addition, some research indicates that abusers are more likely tohave been victimized as children (Peterman & Dixon, 2003).Several of our participants narrated that fear of losing their partner and hence beingleft alone may function to keep them in a violent relationship, especially for queerpeople, as also mentioned earlier. Fear of losing the partner might be so strong thatone avoids bringing up problems or refuses to see them:You know, when you are in love, the problem is you don’t see it. You know that you aretired but you don’t see it, because you all the time think “I don’t want to be alone again…”(Yasemen)DiscussionThe aim of this study was to increase our understanding of how queer women fromethnic minority backgrounds perceive and experience IPV at the intersection of immi-grant status, race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and sexual orientation.As our analysis shows, our participants have a broad understanding of what IPV is,and they all have experienced certain types of abuse related to IPV—namely, physical,sexual, economic, and psychological. Overall, power imbalance in the relationshipseems to be a crucial factor shaping the ways in which our participants have experi-enced IPV. An intersectional approach may fruitfully be utilized to discuss how thispower imbalance is constituted and contextualized for queer women from ethnicminority backgrounds in Norway.The findings together imply that intersecting identities relating to immigration,racial/ethnic minority status, and sexual/gender minority status create vulnerabilitiesand particular experiences of IPV. Understanding how our participants and otherswith similar backgrounds experience IPV demands addressing those intersecting iden-tities in combination (see Cole, 2009). Simultaneously being excluded or discriminatedagainst by the cultural ingroup on the basis of sexual orientation, and being excluded ordiscriminated against by the majority group on the basis of ethnicity, race, and/orsexual orientation, is the case for most of our participants. When the perpetuator ofIPV is a majority member, endowed with and reproducing majority culture’s preju-dices, and the victim is a minority member who is excluded from a potentially protec-tive environment, their cultural ingroup, then the experience of IPV is exacerbated asour analysis reveals. Hence, racism, heteronormative cultural discourses, and immigra-tion status not only render IPV in queer relationships invisible but also affect the inter-nal dynamics and power relations in queer relationships that can further increase therisk of IPV. From a minority stress perspective, we also know that paying attentionto the added stress of being a member of more than one minority group or power hier-archy within a minority group (e.g., being a queer woman from an ethnic minoritybackground) is very crucial to obtain a nuanced understanding of the IPV experiencesamong LGBTQ individuals (Finneran & Stephenson, 2014).18 Violence Against Women 0(0)From an intersectional perspective, there is a growing literature that has shown thatqueer people with minority backgrounds experience racism within the mainstreamwhite queer environment both in Norway (Eggebø et al., 2018) and other countriesin Europe (El-Tayeb, 2012). They also encounter various instances of heterosexismand heteronormativity in their ethnic communities, which force them to hide theirsexual identity. Even though Norway is a country known to be tolerant to sexual diver-sity where the rights of sexual minorities are legally recognized and protected, it is doc-umented that heteronormativity still shapes the everyday experiences of, for instance,queer youth (Svendsen et al., 2018). Furthermore, heteronormativity is reproduced andexalted through a culture of homotolerance (Røthing & Svendsen, 2010). We suggestthat this cultural context should be taken into consideration in making sense of the IPVexperiences of our participants.Our analysis illustrates how being a sexual as well as an ethnic minority may gen-erate a significant power imbalance for queer women who have a relationship with anethnic Norwegian (i.e., majority member of society). Some of our participants haveexperienced abuse connected to their precarious visa situation in Norway. Theywere, for instance, threatened by their partner, who told them that they would bedeported from Norway if they ended the relationship. Thus, dependency created byfear of deportation informs their “choice” to remain in an abusive relationship.Although it has been suggested that conflicts related to dependency and autonomyin same-sex relationships may be exacerbated by power imbalances (e.g., West,2002), studies on IPV among LGBTQ individuals racial and ethnic minorities arevery scarce. Arguably, then, keeping the intersectionality of ethnicity, race, and immi-gration in mind, our analysis provides some much-needed insight into understandinghow queer women with minority backgrounds may experience IPV due to powerimbalance in their romantic relationships.Our analysis also shows that there is a certain degree of difficulty in acknowledgingthe IPV experiences among our participants and that feelings of shame are oftenattached to IPV. We suggest that the strong assumption of equality in partners’same-sex relationships (e.g., Hassouneh & Glass, 2008) generates the idea thatpower imbalance cannot exist between, for instance, two women. Yet, the intersec-tional experiences of our participants have illustrated what role power imbalancemay play, as our participants accommodate various ethnic, migratory, economic,and family backgrounds, all of which might put them in a minority position. Wealso argue that the IPV experiences of queer women remain often invisible in a heter-onormative society, which further makes it harder for queer women to recognize andname the abuse they encounter in their relationship.Although some studies indicate that sexual minorities might have both received andperpetrated some type of IPV in their lifetime (Lewis et al., 2015; Messinger, 2017),research on IPV in LGBTQ individuals is scarce, and the idea of “mutual battering”in queer relationships is controversial (Peterman & Dixon, 2003). Without makingany truth claims here, the defense rhetoric among our participants that their ownviolent behavior should be seen as a strategy to preserve their well-being whenexposed to violence from their partners makes sense given an intersectional approach.Ummak et al. 19The concept of mutual battering might indeed end up invalidating their victimhood, asit presupposes equal power relations between the partners (see also West, 2002).However, intersectionality implies that precisely how IPV is experienced by our par-ticipants should be considered, at least in part, through their ethnic, economic, andsexual minority positions. We hope that our findings will nuance the mainstream“mutual battering” argument in queer relationships.Themes such as childhood traumas, fear, and insecurities are frequently discussed inthe literature on IPV among heterosexuals (Grych & Kinsfogel, 2010). Our analysis,regarding the queer population, provides novel findings, revealing similarities in expe-riencing IPV in both queer and heterosexual relationships.LimitationsSeveral limitations should be mentioned. First, all interviews were done in English,which means that the recruitment process targeted queer women who can speakEnglish. At the same time, the fact that the interviews were not done in the native lan-guage of the informants might have prevented them from expressing themselves ade-quately. Second, the sample size might be considered small. Reaching a specificminority section (identifying as cis-women and having a sexual orientation oflesbian, bisexual, pansexual, demisexual, etc.) within a minority group, LGBTQ pop-ulations, and with an immigrant background is indeed a difficult task. Thus, a caution iswarranted regarding transferability of the analysis presented in this paper. However,leaning on, among others, Kvale and Brinkman (2009) and Trochim (2005), an argu-ment for analytical generalization can be made that the analysis of the current studycould be transferable, depending on similarities between time, place, people, andsocial contexts. For instance, as discussed above, some of our findings resonate withHesselberg (2011) who also reported on IPV in lesbian relationships, pointing outthat women can indeed be oppressors, and with Stubberud and Eggebø (2020) whoreported about intersectional experiences of racism and heterosexism among queerimmigrants in Norway. Third, our participants have predominantly identified theirgender identity as cis women. Thus, the IPV experiences and their implicationsmight be different for nonbinary and trans individuals. Lastly, we recruited participantswith the help of announcements from LGBTQ organizations on their social mediaaccounts, which means that the recruitment process targeted queer women who weremore “out” and active in the community. Therefore, experiences and views of our par-ticipants may not reflect those of queer women who are less out or not associated withLGBTQ organizations and communities.Implications for Research and PracticeOur findings demonstrate that intersecting identities relating to immigration, racial/ethnic minority status, and sexual/gender minority status may create particular vulner-abilities related to IPV. Research is warranted with broader samples of queer individ-uals from more diverse backgrounds (e.g., varying gender identities, sexualities, age20 Violence Against Women 0(0)etc.), to expand on the findings of the current study. Given our findings, we furthersuggest that scales used to measure IPV are reviewed to ensure that they capture thespecific types of violence experienced by LGBTQ populations with several intersect-ing minority identities.Mental health professionals working with LGBTQ individuals will surely benefitfrom understanding how intersecting identities create the unique vulnerabilities ofIPV. Such intersectional understanding may help them more readily identify the multi-axiomatic contextual factors underlying IPV and their role in maintaining mental healthchallenges among LGBTQ clients, thus possibly providing them with ways to addressthe adverse consequences of IPV. Mental health professionals should also advocate forsocial justice, by demanding improved policies and services related to LGBTQ-IPV,which might reduce the health disparities across all gender and sexual identities.Social justice-based therapies, which locate the problem in the societal context andnot the individual, may be particularly helpful for this group (Myers et al., 2002).ConclusionThough equality is a widely assumed characteristic of Norwegian society, governmentreports and our findings alike suggest that heteronormativity and racism do function asenhancive stressors among queer women of ethnic minorities within the context of IPVin Norway. We suggest, therefore, that not only should more work be done to make theproblem of IPV among this group visible, but also psycho-social interventions shouldbe tailored to address the specific needs of this group.AcknowledgmentsThe first author is grateful to Dr. Bjørn Lau, Dr. Beate Seibt, and Dr. Milan Obaidi for theirsupport during their visitation in psychology department at University of Oslo.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship,and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of thisarticle.ORCID iDEsra Ummak https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3905-5626ReferencesAdams, A.

    "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2022Drawing upon in-depth, semi-structured interviews, this study explored how queer women from ethnic minority backgrounds in Norway understand and experience intimate partner violence (IPV). Based on an intersectional approach, the study highlights and discusses how having multiple minority positions may inform and affect the way participants experience IPV. The analysis shows that participants’ experiences of IPV are shaped by their multiple minority statuses in Norwegian society. A discussion is provided that revolves around how being a sexual as well as an ethnic minority generates a significant power imbalance for the participants in their relationships.publishedVersio",
