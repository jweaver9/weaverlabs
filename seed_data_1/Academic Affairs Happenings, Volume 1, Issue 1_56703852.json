Academic AffairsNewsletter. Paper 1.http://docs.rwu.edu/academic_affairs_news/1                 Message from the Provost    Dear Faculty,  I’m pleased to present the first edition of the Academic Affairs Happenings newsletter.   As you will see, our office received a large number of submissions which, taken as a whole, reflect the wide range of work in which you are engaged.   I hope that learning more about the projects of your colleagues will lay the foundation for making connections that result in more collaborative work across the institution.    The format for this newsletter will evolve over the course of future editions and we welcome suggestions on how it can be improved.  Later this semester my office will send out a call for the February newsletter which will include options for reporting on your own work and that of your colleagues.  This time around we found that some of the most interesting items came from the reports of faculty members about their more modest colleagues.  Finally I would like to give special thanks to Lori Barry and Robert Cole for their work in pulling this newsletter together.  Best,  Andy Workman Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs     Academic Affairs Happenings F r o m  t h e  O f f i c e  o f  t h e  P r o v o s t   O c t o b e r  2 0 1 2  V o lu m e  1 ,  I s s u e  1          Laura D’Amore - A course requirement of an activist project in AMST 430: LGBTQ Lives, led to a bunch of exciting happenings on campus: RWU/LGBTQ pride tee shirts, flower pins to bring attention to violence against the LGBTQ community, a showing of a film about transgender identity followed by a student-led discussion, a student-led dialogue about LGBTQ discrimination on campus, a red-ribbon campaign for AIDs awareness, a WRWU radio show about gender identity, informative pamphlets in the commons, displays in GHH and Almeida, and a student-led proposal for gender neutral housing.  For Women’s History month in March, six students presented their gender studies research in a panel for the RWU community.  Professor D’Amore accompanied three students to present their own original research at a Women’s Studies conference at Gettysburg College, “Gender, Sex, and Poverty,” in March 2012.  In addition, she accompanied three students to present their own original research at the Film & History Conference in Milwaukee, WI, “Film and Myth,” in September 2012.  In Renee Soto’s CW 350 Writers Reading Poetry class, students wrote, designed and hand-sewed their own chapbooks.  The manuscripts were forwarded to the poet Julie Funderburk who did a first read and selected three manuscripts to forward to our National Poetry Month visiting poet, Nathaniel Perry.  Mr. Perry selected the manuscript written by Chelsea Silva, sophomore at the time, to be part of the collaboration with a graphic design student that resulted in a professionally designed and printed, perfect-bound chapbook.  Chelsea and Krista Tierney, one of the other top three student poets chosen by Ms. Funderburk, read from their chapbooks sort of as “opening acts” for Mr. Perry’s reading at the Mary Tefft White Cultural Center this past April in front of a crowd of about 70 people.  A poem from Chelsea’s  chapbook was also published in the national literacy magazine Santa Clara Review.   This summer, Paula Prado and Jeremy Campbell led eight students on a new 7-credit study abroad course in the Amazon.  This new combined course, Environmental Justice in Brazil, engaged students for 20 days in two 3-credit courses (in Anthropology/Sociology and Journalism) and one-credit service learning on site in the Amazon region.  Highlights of the course are posted online at http://environmentaljusticeinbrazil.wordpress.com/.  The course will be offered again during summer 2013.    Top Row: V. Glasson, J. Wiggin, J. Campbell, P. Prado, L. Garrison, V. Mordasky Bottom Row: T. Lee Bar, R. Bukhamseen, J. Hamlin, J. Nussbaum  In spring 2012 Jeremy Wells’ HP682 students completed a “Main Street implementation plan” for the Washington Park neighborhood in Providence in partnership with the local community and the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation with assistance from the community, the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation and the RWU CPC. Through the students’ work, the neighborhood is now starting their own Main Street program to help revitalize their commercial center.  In our Classrooms  Education Professor Kelly Donnell has connected her Urban Education course with a graduate-level Architectural Studio course being taught by Visiting-Firm-In Residence DesignLAB with Needs Assessment and Space Planning with Meeting Street School (Providence).  Together the education and architecture students are collaborating to assist Meeting Street School in programming and conceptualizing possible reuse of a vacated industrial building directly across from Meeting Street School’s main campus.  Designers are informed by educational practitioners and future educators are learning about the impact of space design on educational proactive and the conceptual programs and designs prepared at the end of the course will help the school make a decision about the building.  Adams Memorial Library (Central Falls) Children’s Room Design project:  Education Professor Kerry Ullucci and her team of educators in Literacy are collaborating with the graduate-level Architectural Studio course being taught by Visiting-Firm-In-Residence DesignLAB.  Together the education and architecture students are exploring the role of the public library in the 21st Century, and how older spaces can be repurposed for teaching reading skills to a racially diverse and multi-lingual community.  Joint site visits and discussion sessions inform the work of both sections, and the results will drive the Library’s capital campaign.  Several faculty members are collaborating in their courses on Charter Square Urban Design on October 19-20 Charrette (Newport), helping Newport to hold a constructive dialogue about a significant, underutilized public space.  Professor Sara Butler’s Newport Seminar is taking the lead in research prior to the event, while Professor Ann Winfield’s course in Issues in Multicultural Education is connecting the planning effort to the Thompson Middle School, two blocks from the project site.  Adjunct Professor Hank Kniskern from the Gabelli School of Business is leading a class of student who are working with the Town of Bristol to prepare an Operational Feasibility Plan for the Bristol Marine Armory Boating Center on the waterfront.  Adjunct Professor of Historic Preservation, Nancy Austin, is focusing her Archival Research course on a collaborative project with the Barrington Preservation Society entitled “Uncovering Barrington’s Industrial Past”.  The results from the fall semester class will serve as a starting point for Professor Jennifer Stevens’ Labor History course in the spring which will carry out detailed research and oral history documentation.  Adjunct Professor Joel Cooper of the Gabelli School of Business has several teams in his fall Small Business Institute course which are engaged with the community.  One team is assisting the RI Economic Development Corporation and the City of Providence with business development planning and assistance on Broad Street in Providence, while another is creating a marketing plan for the Historic Warren Armory.  Professor Kathy Micken of the Gabelli School of Business is leading a Marketing course which is providing important assistance to the East Bay Coalition for the Homeless Services Awareness Campaign, working with East Bay Community Action Program as their community partner.  In addition, the RWU Honors Program is lending its support as well, and Professor Jeremy Campbell has students assisting in the effort.  Engineering faculty Professors Bill Palm, Tony Ruocco and Jim Brunnhoefer are leading a Senior Engineering Capstone course as they solve the design issues for a new cradle to support a massive model of the Reliance, one of the largest yachts produced in Bristol, with the Herreshoff Marine Museum.  Architecture Professor Gary Graham is working with Blithewold Museum and Arboretum in his Design Conceptualization course.  The students will work within the framework of the newly adopted Blithewold Master Plan and explore the possible location, size and design ideas for an expanded Visitor’s Center.  This will be used by Blithewold as they decide the direction of the project.  Professor Rebecca Leuchak has adopted several community projects in her graduate-level Museum Studies course, and has teams collaborating with Blithewold Museum and Arboretum, the Herreshoff Marine Museum, the Paine House and the Beavertail Lighthouse Museum.
