Colorado Civil Rights Commission, as a critical extension of\nDerrick Bell's interest-convergence thesis into the LGBTQ movement. Chiefly,\nMasterpiece reveals how the Court has been more willing to accommodate gay\nindividuals who appear more assimilated and respectable-such as those who\nparticipated in the marriage-equality decisions-than LGBTQ individuals who\nare less \"mainstream\" and whose exhibited queerness appear threatening to the\nheteronormative status quo. When assimilated same-sex couples sought\nmarriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, their respectable personas facilitated the\nalignment between their interest to marry and the Court's interest in affirming\nthe primacy of marriage. Masterpiece, however, demonstrates that when the\nlitigants' sexual identities seem less assimilated and more destabilizing to the\nstatus quo, the Court becomes much less inclined to protect them from\ndiscrimination and, in turn, reacts by reinforcing its interest to preserve the status-\nquo-one that relies on religious freedoms to fortify heteronormativity. To push\nthis observation further, this Article explores how such failure of interest\nconvergence in Masterpiece extends Derrick Bell's thesis on involuntary racial\nsacrifice and fortuity into the LGBTQ context-arguing that Masterpiece is\nessentially an example of queer sacrifice.

Colorado Civil Rights\nCommission1 illustrates that the dominant status quo is still able to pick and\nchoose ways to discriminate against sexual minorities. This Article will show\nhow this impasse from fully reaching sexual orientation antidiscrimination in\nMasterpiece is associated with the choices that the gay movement has made to\nshape the visibility of sexual minorities, particularly from the Court's prior\nmarriage cases. Marriage equality is not true equality. Marriage-equality\nlitigation purposely depicted same-sex couples as distinctively aligned and\nassimilated with the dominant status quo in order to increase the likelihood that\nthe Court would extend marriage rights.2 In writing about Obergefell v. Hodges,\nothers have noted that eventual success was premised on this carefully crafted\nimage of sameness, assimilation, and respectability because it allowed the\ninterests of same-sex couples in seeking marriage rights to converge with the\nCourt's interests in affirming the heteronormative institution of marriage. 3\nIndeed, through such an interpretation of Obergefell, some have borrowed\nDerrick Bell's well-regarded interest-convergence thesis from critical race\ntheory and applied it to explain how the Court reached its decision to extend\nmarriage rights to same-sex couples.4\nIn examining Masterpiece, this Article affirms and advances further such\napplication of Bell's thesis to the recent marriage-equality decision. It explores\nMasterpiece as an example where interests failed to converge and what that\nfailure signifies. Deviating from its high regard for assimilated same-sex couples\nin Obergefell, the Supreme Court in Masterpiece was unwilling to accommodate\nthe less assimilated, less seemingly respectable queer identities of the same-sex\ncouple involved. Instead, their queerness led the Court to reinforce interests in\npreserving the status quo-one that currently protects religious exercise over the\nrights of sexual minorities. In this way, the Article will extend further analogies\nto Derrick Bell's racial justice theorizing-not only from his interest-\nconvergence thesis but also his later theories on involuntary racial sacrifice and\nfortuity-to explain how Masterpiece speaks profoundly about the current\nprogress of LGBTQ rights in the post-marriage-equality era. Applying Bell's\ntheory of involuntary racial sacrifice, Masterpiece is ultimately a grave example\n1. 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018).\n2. See generally Cynthia Godsoe, Perfect Plaintiffs, 125 YALE L.J.

Nevertheless, the Article will also use Bell's theorizing to\ninvariably show how sexual minorities ought to forge ahead.\nPart I explores assimilationist strategies in both the gay movement and\neventually the marriage-equality sub-movement that culminated in the\nproliferation of images of sameness and respectability that helped leverage\nmarriage, but also sustained externalities that have inhibited future successes in\nthe gay movement. Part II first compares the assimilative characteristics of the\nsame-sex couples from Obergefell against the queer sexualities of the\nMasterpiece couple. Then the section examines Masterpiece to show how the\ndecision is an example of queer sacrifice and what this sacrifice implies for\nLGBTQ equality going forward. Finally, Part III uses guidance from Bell's\nforged-fortuity theory for solutions in the movement's next steps beyond\nMasterpiece.\nI. ASSIMILATIONIST STRATEGIES IN MARRIAGE EQUALITY\nA. Assimilation Versus Liberation: Historical Tensions\nQuestions of strategy have always embroiled themselves centrally in the\nsocial and political advancements of sexual minorities' rights and visibility. Even\nin earlier mid-twentieth-century efforts, various incarnations of the American\nLGBTQ movement have pondered and taken sides between embracing\nassimilationist strategies, which insist on a rights-based perspective within the\nexisting liberal democratic regime, and liberationist strategies, which assert\nchange from a more revolutionary perspective outside the dominant political\ndistourse.5 This basic tug-of-war between strategies famously ripped through the\nMattachine Society, an early gay rights group that dominated over the homophile\nmovement of the 1950s-a precursor movement of the contemporary LGBTQ\ncrusade.6 Initially, the Mattachine Society embraced liberationist values and led\nthe homophile movement by organizing a militant following, igniting participant\nself-awareness as an active minority group, and dedicating efforts toward legal\nadvancements and changes in public perceptions against sexual minorities.\n7\nDuring the McCarthy Era, liberationist strategies and ideologies, which\nembodied communist principles, eventually led to conflict within the Mattachine\nSociety, especially when \"rank and file Mattachine members grew increasingly\nconcerned with the organization's possible association with communism.\"8 In\n5.

Id.\n[Vol. 31.2:249\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nthe disagreement between founding Mattachine leaders and its membership, the\ncentral conflict between assimilation and liberation arose as \"[t]he Mattachine\nfounders envisioned a separate homosexual culture while other members worried\nthat such a strategy would only increase the hostile social climate.\" 9 Unlike their\nliberationist-entrenched leadership, the society's newer members \"called for\nintegration into mainstream society\" and that conflict led to change at the helms\nof the Mattachine in 1953.10\nSuch change ultimately resulted in the homophile movement's abandonment\nof liberationist approaches for assimilationist ones. 11 From the mid- 195 Os, this\nrevamped homophile movement focused on initiating dialogue with mainstream\nsociety by presenting sexual minorities as upright citizens in order to change\npublic perceptions of homosexuality. 12 Specifically, \"[t]heir strategy was to\npresent themselves as reasonable, well-adjusted people, hoping that these\nheterosexual arbiters of public opinion would rethink their assumptions\nregarding homosexuality.' 3 Unlike the earlier tactic, the activists' strategy now\npromoted sameness between the heterosexual mainstream and sexual minorities:\n\"This approach, rooted in dialogue, emphasized conformity and attempted to\nminimize any differences between heterosexuality and homosexuality.\" 14 That\napproach prevailed until the time of the Stonewall uprising in 1969.15\nAfter Stonewall, liberationist strategies gained more traction as gay and\nlesbian activism of the late 1960s transitioned to reflect the radical politics of the\n1970s. 16 Assimilationist strategies took a back seat as the goal of many gay\nactivists at the time was to revolutionize society and not merely change\nmainstream perceptions.' 7 During this time, the work of the Gay Liberation Front\ncame to the forefront of the gay rights movement by challenging the status quo.' 8\nOne of its noted works involved mainstream representations of sexual minorities\nthrough language and cultural imagery.

In the 1970s,\nsame-sex couples in several states across the United States also initiated lawsuits\nto obtain the right to marry.28 At that time, during the liberationist heyday, the\nunderlying purpose of these lawsuits focused more on the legal participation that\nmarriage would afford sexual minorities than on any integrationist notions of\nbecoming part of the mainstream. 29 Exclusion from marriage meant that the\nrights and incidents of marriage enjoyed by wedded opposite-sex couples, such\nas tax liability reductions, health care, and social security survivor benefits,\neluded same-sex couples. 30 Such desire for equal treatment was often the actual\ngoal of these early same-sex marriage suits, rather than folding sexual minorities\ninto the social fabric. 31 Unfortunately, none of the same-sex couples who sued\nfor the right to marry ever prevailed in these early efforts-including Baker v.\nNelson, a case involving a male same-sex couple who sued to determine whether\nthe Minnesota marriage statute authorized same-sex marriages after being denied\na marriage license. 32 The couple's case reached the Minnesota Supreme Court,\nwhich ruled against finding that the marriage statute authorized same-sex\nmarriage, in part because the purpose of traditional marriage was procreative. 33\nAt the time, that reasoning precluded same-sex couples from having a\nfundamental right in marriage, so the Minnesota Supreme Court was able to find\ntheir exclusion was not unconstitutional.3 4 For that reason, when the couple\n26.

The now-\nclassic 1989 debate between Paula Ettelbrick and Tom Stoddard published in\nOut/Look Magazine exposes the assimilationist-versus-liberationist tensions that\nactivism and ultimately obtaining the right to marry would bring.36 Ettelbrick\nand Stoddard were colleagues at the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, but expressed\nprofound differences on the idea of same-sex marriage. 37 Ettelbrick held views\nagainst same-sex marriage while Stoddard possessed favorable ones.38 Their\ndebate illustrates quite succinctly, but effectively, some of the fundamental\nassimilationist-versus-liberationist perspectives on marriage recognition for\nsame-sex couples.\nThough not completely in favor of the institution of marriage, Stoddard took\nthe position \"that every lesbian and gay man should have the right to marry the\nsame-sex partner of his or her choice, and that the gay rights movement should\naggressively seek full legal recognition for same-sex marriages.\" ' 9 He then\nunderscored his strong belief through practical, political, and philosophical\nexplanations that all more or less illustrated how marriage would uphold and\nintegrate same-sex couples within mainstream society. 40 As examples, Stoddard\nmentioned the practical tax benefits of same-sex couples in marriage, 4 1 the\npolitical implications of mainstream acceptance of gays through marriage,42 and\nthe philosophical stance of seeking the right for same-sex couples to marry as a\nposition of parity with opposite-sex couples and the transformative potential\nsame-sex couples would bring to traditional marriage as reasons for the\nmovement to pursue marriage.4\n3\n35. 409 U.S. 810 (1972).\n36.

It robs of me of the opportunity to make a difference. We\nend up mimicking all that is bad about an institution of marriage in our\neffort to appear to be the same as straight couples.50\nThat inauthenticity would accommodate the inequalities within gay culture and\nsociety as well:\nOf course, a white man who marries another white man who has a full-\ntime job with benefits will certainly be able to share in those benefits\nand overcome the only obstacle left to full societal assimilation-the\ngoal of many in his class. In other words, gay marriage will not topple\nthe system that allows only the privileged few to obtain decent health\ncare. Nor will it close the privilege gap between those who are married\nand those who are not.5\nInsightfully, Ettelbrick predicted the decline in gay political advancement once\nmarriage is obtained: \"If the laws change tomorrow and lesbians and gay men\nwere allowed to marry, where would we find the incentive to continue the\nprogressive movement we have started that is pushing for societal and legal\n44.

'52 All in all, her reasons against\npursuing marriage were predominantly pointed at how it would subordinate\nsexual minorities underneath a multidimensional, white heteronormative\nsupremacy both externally and from within the movement.\nIn pre-Obergefell 1989, the Stoddard-Ettelbrick pro-and-con debate in\nOut/Look Magazine illuminated profound complications that the idea of\nmarriage underscored between assimilationist and liberationist strategies for the\nmovement as a whole. But in light of any efforts to resist conformity and\nassimilation, marriage-equality activism began to advance shortly around the\ntime the Stoddard-Ettelbrick debate was published.53 For more than a decade,\ninterest in advancing same-sex marriage waned as the AIDS epidemic\novershadowed marriage in priority.54 Additionally, in 1986, the Bowers v.\nHardwick decision at the Supreme Court added new shifts and dimensions in\nactivist priorities as decriminalizing sodomy became a priority as well.55 Then,\nhowever, interest in marriage increased consequentially as the impact that the\nAIDS epidemic pressed upon inheritance and death benefits issues affecting\nsexual minorities.56 Prompted by this correlation, in 1989, the State Bar of\nCalifornia officially recommended legally recognizing same-sex marriages.\n57\nThen, in the early 1990s, marriage litigation reignited-this time in Hawaii-\nand eventually led to the temporary success of Baehr v.

Sameness as Respectability\nWhile Obergefell was being heard at the Supreme Court-just a little more\nthan two decades after Baehr-the effects of assimilationist strategies in the\nmarriage-equality and gay rights movements had continued to crystallize.\nEttelbrick's reasons for apprehension had, indeed, manifested. Mere months\nbefore the Obergefell decision, Alexander Nourafshan and Angela Onwuachi-\nWillig echoed what other scholars had articulated-that gay rights successes in\npursuing marriage equality had incurred some inroads toward formal equality,\nbut the progress retained, if not deepened, some substantial limits for the\nmovement as a whole:\nAlthough Windsor and the revolution of cases that have led to Obergfell\n[sic] hold significant promise for one privileged subset of gays and\nlesbians-white, economically privileged, and educated gays and\nlesbians-they do not necessarily carry the same potential for less\nprivileged subgroups within the gay and lesbian community, namely\ngays and lesbians of color.\n67\nAccording to Nourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig, in championing marriage,\nmovement proponents had, historically throughout the struggle up to Obergefell,\nembraced assimilationist tactics over liberationist ones: \"[R]ather than seek to\ndisrupt the paradigm of heteronormativity, assimilation-oriented homosexuals\nsought to fit gay rights into the existing legal and social structure, without\nthreatening to upend the social order.\" 68 Such conformity to the order would also\nmean adapting to norms that replicate the existing institutional hierarchies of the\nmainstream status quo.6 9 Others have similarly discerned that the assimilative\npush for marriage equality was done through channeling away some important\ndisparities within the gay community and movement for the sake of expressing\nsameness with the mainstream. 70 Thus, even before the 2003 success in\nMassachusetts through Goodridge v.

According to Yuvraj Joshi, \"[r]espectability is an\nindispensable concept to understand the queer politics of recognition. 8 5 In part,\nsuch indispensability is so because \"respectability ... has characterized legal\nrecognition of same-sex relationships.\" 86 In fact, in Joshi's view, legal\nrecognition of same-sex relationships has concentrated on the degree of\nsameness observed between same-sex and mainstream opposite-sex\nrelationships: \"[W]here legal recognition has been afforded . . . to same-sex\nrelationships . . . it has tended to center on their normalcy rather than their\ndiversity and inherent worth. ' 87 Under Joshi's observation, same-sex couples'\n\"normalcy\" is directed at the degree to which their normalcy matches the\nnormalcy of mainstream opposite-sex couples; invariably, it is another way of\ndescribing sameness. In this way, marriage proponents have relied on\nassimilationist strategies because, as Joshi notes, \"[m]uch of the literature on\nlesbian and gay recognition uses the language of assimilation to explain such\nrecognition.\n8 8\nOf course, what kind of normalcy and sameness also matters. Although this\nrelationship between assimilation and respectability can be close, the concepts\nof assimilation and respectability are not one and the same. Specifically,\n[a]ssimilation explains many of the pressures to integrate into the\nheterosexual mainstream, but it does not capture the various ways in\nwhich lesbians and gays constitute themselves as being worthy of\nrecognition. Respectability, as a discursive concept expressing a\nnormative ideal, provides a more comprehensive conceptual framework\nto understand such recognition.8\n9\nOne can also explain this difference between the two on utilitarian terms-that,\nin essence, assimilation can serve as a means to obtain respectability. For\ninstance, in African-American history, as \"early respectability politics sought to\nchallenge racist imagery of inferiority by cultivating the opposite image, i.e., the\neconomically successful, upright Black citizen,\" 90 some have observed that\n\"[i]ntegration and assimilation became the key vehicle through which advocates\n84.

Rather, the attainment of respectability in the marriage-equality\ncampaign existed in tandem with the push to construct a respectable image for\n91. Id.\n92. Joshi, supra note 76, at 421.\n93.

As Joshi observes, \"[i]f respectability is measured\nby proximity to middle-class heterosexuality, same-sex marriage is a clear\nmanifestation of this.\"1\"' In this way, as middle-class heterosexuality would\nrepresent the mainstream status quo, same-sex couples vying for the right to\nmarry would, in order to be respectable, also have needed to embody or heighten\nenough specific material sameness with the mainstream to be worthy of status\nquo validation. Thus the parallel push for assimilated gays to appear respectable\nin general society seemed to inform performances of respectability in the\nmarriage movement: \"[P]rior constructions of gays and lesbians as asexual,\napolitical, producing and consuming subjects have been instrumental in bringing\nabout marriage equality.\" 10 1 From there, projecting respectability has led to a\n\"moral de-sexing and middle-classing of lesbian and gays. 10 2 More specifically\nas to the idea of \"moral de-sexing,\" Joshi posits that \"[l]esbians and gays may\nproduce performances of respectability as defensive strategies of being\nsexualized. Respectability may be a means of stopping their sexuality from\nbecoming a barrier to their success and happiness or a safe space away from the\npain and suffering of homophobia.\" 10 3 Thus, sexual minorities sanitize their\nsexuality or \"tone-down\" allusions to their non-heteronormative sexual behavior\nthat could trigger negative stereotyping. \"Middle-classing\" is likely Joshi's\nshorthand for the \"[c]onspicuous consumption [that] has been crucial to the\nconstruction of gay men and, to a lesser extent, lesbians as respectable citizen-\nconsumers.\" 104 It comports to the materialism that establishment norms\nencourage.

In part, as Franke mentions, this\nunderlying aim was demonstrated by the overwhelming presence of white\nlitigants, white lawyers, and white individuals who led mainstream LGBTQ\norganizations all vying for the recognition of marriage equality up to\nObergefell.1 13 Others have noted that economic status' 14 and the embodiment of\n105.

Sameness arguments were particularized\nto demonstrate respectability of same-sex relationships and to minimize their\ndifferences from the mainstream in order to gain worth for recognition.\n2. Respectability and Interest Convergence\nRespectability, however, is not an end in itself. Utilizing respectability, the\nmovement demonstrated same-sex couples were not merely similar to\nmainstream couples, they were also exemplary enough to receive the right to\nmarry and would not threaten the status quo or the institution of traditional\nmarriage because of it. Borrowing from Derrick Bell's racial justice theorizing,\nhis interest-convergence thesis helps illuminate the correlation between\nrespectability and the success of marriage equality in this way. In theorizing\nracial inequality, Bell posited that the recognition of legal rights of subordinated\nracial groups occurs upon convincing the white decisionmakers that the interests\nof both groups converge. 117 Using Brown v. Board of Education, Bell\nhypothesized that the reason why African-American claimants successfully\noverturned segregation was because their interests and the interests of the\ndominant status quo happened to converge. In particular, at the time of the ruling,\nthe impetus to maintain foreign national allies during the Cold War prompted an\nimperative to repudiate instances of racial discrimination domestically in the\nUnited States1 18 As a result, segregation was overturned.\nIn propelling gay rights and legal protections, the strategy to align interests\nis not exclusive to race. Anthony Michael Kreis has drawn several accounts that\nreveal the impact of interest convergence in gay rights advances before marriage\nequality. 19 By reading together Romer v.

In other words, the legal protections sexual minorities were\nasking for can be granted so long as such protections would not threaten the\nheteronormative status quo. Interest convergence thus played out in the\nLawrence ruling.\nImporting Bell's interest-convergence theory from its roots within racial-\ninequality discourse into the realm of LGBTQ-rights advancement has potential\ndrawbacks, as the history and nature of discrimination and oppression for sexual\nminorities are not identical to racial minorities.' 2 6 But, as others have noted,\nBell's interest-convergence thesis does transfer quite readily into the marriage-\nequality movement. 127 Again, sameness and respectability politics play out in\naligning interests.

Windsor.134 For instance,\nNourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig noted that\n[u]nder the theory of interest convergence, Edith Windsor, a wealthy,\nwhite'woman in a long-term committed relationship in New York City,\nwas, in many ways, the perfect plaintiff to challenge DOMA [the\nDefense of Marriage Act] because she could be sold as part of a\nrespectable, assimilation-based gay image to the general public and,\nmore importantly, to those in power.\n1 35\nWindsor's image, in the case that overturned DOMA, had been cautiously\nmanaged; and assimilation and respectability figured into that management.\n1 36\nElements of race, wealth, and sexuality were at the heart of constructing\nWindsor's image. Russell Robinson and David Frost have mentioned that\n\"Windsor's case did not accidentally end up at the Supreme Court' 13 7 and that\n\"her lawyer Roberta Kaplan argued within the marriage-equality movement that\nWindsor was a superior client for a Supreme Court challenge\" because certain\nfeatures such as her widow status, her gender, and her age lent favorable\noptics. 138 Highlighting several features of respectability, Cynthia Godsoe has\nremarked that \"[tihe fact that [Windsor] is white, well-educated, and wealthy no\ndoubt also helped Supreme Court Justices relate to her,\"' 39 and that the lawyers'\ndepiction of Windsor's relationship with her deceased spouse Thea Spyer as\n\"decidedly G-rated\" was in part to minimize her sexual orientation. 140\nNourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig illustrate even further the respectability\nimplications of Windsor's image control. Beyond the \"G-rated\" connotations of\nWindsor's marriage to Spyer, particular aspects of their marriage embodied\nsameness arguments skewed toward respectability. According to Nourafshan\nand Onwuachi-Willig, Windsor's \"wedding was 'mainstream' enough to be\nfeatured in the New York Times wedding section, even though the state of New\nYork did not recognize same-sex marriage until 2012., '14' The educational levels\n133.

Windsor's estate-taxes dispute could be\n\"highly salient to white elites, both gay and non-gay alike.\" 14' Her\n\"respectability-based identity as a lesbian represented a departure from the\nstereotype of hyper-sexuality that is often affiliated with or imputed to gay\nculture' '148-even though \"[i]n truth, Windsor's relationship with Spyer was very\nsexual\"-and she agreed to avoid discussing her sexuality throughout the case. 149\nWindsor's \"racial identity as a white woman reified the primacy of whiteness in\nthe gay community and gay rights movement.' 150 Not to mention, \"her identity\nas an educated Northerner reinforced notions of sophistication and assimilation\nin the gay and lesbian community.' 151 Combined, these attributes \"helped to\nremove the stigma of otherness (to an extent) and thus enabled broad swaths of\npeople to identify with her.\"' 152\n.

He seems\nto underscore the effect that DOMA had placed on valid state same-sex\nmarriages compared to opposite-sex marriages on the federal level, noting that\nDOMA suggests \"[a couple's valid same-sex] marriage is less worthy than the\nmarriages of others,\" and as a result \"disparage[s]\" and \"injure[s]\" those same-\nsex couples who legitimately sought state protections to marry.155 Why deny\nfederal recognition and unnecessarily demean same-sex couples who seem\nrespectable enough to be considered sufficiently similar to opposite-sex couples\nand who seemingly would not threaten the institution of marriage? The\nimplication here is that same-sex marriages are like opposite-sex marriages in\nterms of worthiness. Worthiness, having been conceived in respectability, ought\nto counter perceptions that same-sex couples threatened marriage. Thus, any\nmainstream interest to protect marriage against these \"worthy,\" respectable\ncouples were ameliorated enough for Windsor and other couples to be federally\nrecognized. In essence, here in Windsor, the interests of same-sex couples and\nthe dominant status quo sufficiently converged.\nD. The Obergefell Couples\n1. The Respectability Template\nIn examining the Obergefell plaintiffs, Cynthia Godsoe has noted that\nattorneys' strategies in managing their plaintiffs' \"ordinariness\" and\n\"approachability\" also hinged on portraying a sense of normality. 156 This\nobservation is reminiscent of Joshi's reflection that \"normalcy\" appeared in the\nconstruction of respectability in assimilationist strategies. Indeed, animating\nboth the selection of the twenty-nine Obergefell plaintiffs and their performance\nof attributes, the strategy of being normal was targeted chiefly toward convincing\nthe status quo that same-sex couples were \"just like them\" in ways that\nmaximized and ensured sufficient interest convergence that would render\npositive outcomes-using the members of the Court as proxies for the status quo:\n153.

Skilled advocates\n\"play by its rules, and tell the Justices stories they like to hear about\npeople who remind them of themselves.\" In other words, plaintiffs\nshould assimilate to norms that the Justices understand and their lawyers\nshould play down differences.1 57\nThe payoff of such persuasive perception-building has some notable\ncorroboration. As former Chief Justice William Rehnquist has written, \"judges\ngo home at night and read the newspapers or watch the evening news on\ntelevision; they talk to their family and friends about current events. Somewhere\n'out there'-beyond the walls of the courthouse-run currents and tides of public\nopinion which lap at the courthouse door.' 58\nIn Obergefell, Godsoe observes that the result of such elaborate perception-\nbuilding \"reveals some deep-rooted assumptions about what a family should\nlook like and what is an appropriate path to social change.' ' 159 Assimilationist\nstrategies would likely pave that path. According to Godsoe's research, the\nObergefell plaintiffs were \"largely homogenous and non-representative of LGB\nfamilies,' 160 and their similarities and attributes can be categorized and compiled\ninto an archetypal template. Though self-identified as sexual minorities, the\nObergefell plaintiffs appear to Godsoe to share four common traits; they are (1)\ntypically all-American, (2) asexual, (3) devoted to child-rearing and/or\ncaregiving, and (4) accidentally political. 161 And despite being framed as\nassimilation-based, these four traits ultimately achieve not merely a sense of\nassimilation but one of respectability as well.\nAs a matter of fact, Godsoe's first category of \"all-Americanness\"\nstraightforwardly connotes respectability. After all, what does \"all-American\"\nsignify if not that which is situated at the pinnacle of mainstream American\nsociety and identity? Consonant with this thought, Godsoe describes \"all-\nAmerican\" as \"reflect[ing] a traditional 'Leave it to Beaver' American ideal ' 162\ntypified by their \"overwhelmingly white and middle or upper-middle class 1 63\n157.

They are respectable because of their projections of\nnormalcy.\nGodsoe also noted that the Obergefell plaintiffs were \"asexual\" or de-\nsexualized 176-meaning that their highly crafted image avoided the stereotypical\nnotions of gay promiscuity or even reminded the public or the Court of non-\nheteronormative sex: \"Not one of the many photographs and videos available\nonline depict a plaintiff kissing his or her partner. Sex is never mentioned.' 77\nInstead, their \"asexual\" images portray monogamous couples comnitted in their\nrelationships to one another a78 To borrow from Kreis's observations regarding\ninterest convergence from Lawrence,179 the desexualization of plaintiffs here\nlikely serves to signal and underscore their non-threatening nature-how the\nqualities of their same-sex relationships (which would include aspects of sex and\nsexual intimacy) would not threaten the establishment's sense of social order.\nOne might find irony in the Obergefell attorneys' need to desexualize their\nplaintiffs despite the progress already made by the Court in Lawrence to\ndecriminalize consensual same-sex intimacy-in other words, despite the Court\nhaving perhaps neutralized that threat. 180 Thus, the tactic to desexualize the\nObergefell plaintiffs here would seem overprotective, and overstates the notion\nin Lawrence that consensual same-sex sexual activity bore no harm to the\nestablishment. But that ironic view is shortsighted. First, as with Edith Windsor's\ncase, respectability required desexualization of the plaintiffs to maintain\nsameness and to avoid triggering notions of non-heterosexual sexuality. The\nspecter of gay or queer sexualities and sexual practices-or worse, the\nhypersexual stereotypes of gay men-could still prove destabilizing or\nthreatening to a heteronormative mainstream. Secondly, the truth about the sex\nin controversy in Lawrence itself was that it was unlikely to have met\ntraditionally heteronormative standards of sex and monogamy. 81 The Lawrence\n175. Id.

' 183 Thus,\nin Obergefell, the plaintiffs had to avoid triggering such perceptions by\nappearing asexual or sterile enough for sex to be categorically ignored. 84 All in\nall, the prophylactic move to desexualize the Obergefell plaintiffs seemed aimed\nat minimizing any indication of threat to the mainstream social order in exchange\nfor respectability.\nAccording to Godsoe, the Obergefell plaintiffs were also engaged in child-\nrearing at a degree much higher than statistics for the sexual minority population\nor, if they did not have children, were often engaged in caretaking\nresponsibilities for their partners or parents. 185 Godsoe observed that caregiving\n\"not only further desexualizes LGB relationships, but also entrenches the\nprivatization of dependency, exempting the state from responsibility for\nsupporting the disabled and children.\"'1 86 Not only does caregiving facilitate the\n\"reward\" for receiving legal recognition of marriage, as Godsoe describes,187 but\nthe use of child-rearing and caregiving also aligns the interests of sexual\nminorities with the establishment by again minimizing same-sex relationships as\nnon-threatening and appearing to uphold mainstream values of child-rearing and\nfamily 188-hinting at the societal worthiness attributed to respectability.

In turn, once the plaintiffs' respectable identities\nwere established, respectability facilitated sufficient interest convergence and\nultimately accessed Kennedy's dignity jurisprudence. It is through such interest\nconvergence, built up by respectability politics, that the transitive connection\nbetween assimilationist strategies in marriage and Kennedy's dignity\njurisprudence emerges.\nIn Obergefell, much of the descriptive and historical portions of Kennedy's\nmajority opinion-the sections that eventually tee up to his fundamental-rights\nrationale-demonstrates his acceptance of the assimilated and respectable vision\nof same-sex couples. First, his aim, as he reveals at the beginning of the\ndecision's second section, seems to involve countering mainstream sentiments\nthat \"it would demean a timeless institution if the concept and lawful status of\nmarriage were extended to two persons of the same sex.\" 20 0 In effect, he\nexplicitly references the establishment's interest in protecting marriage from\nthreats of institutional sullying, pointing out that some in the mainstream still\nview same-sex couples as an indecent threat in this way-perhaps a threat of ill-\nrepute that respectability could fix. Likely, in what Nan Hunter deems \"cultural\ninterest convergence,\"\"2 1 Kennedy first draws portrayals of some of the plaintiffs\nvying for the legal recognition of marriage to rebut mainstream notions that\nsame-sex couples were perceived threats to marriage. 202 He attempts to\nhumanize them, but does so on respectable terms. Plaintiff Jim Obergefell is the\ncommitted and tireless caretaker of an ailing husband.20 3 April DeBoer and Jayne\nRowse, committed in a long-term relationship, are nurses who have fostered and\nadopted abandoned infants. 204 Ijpe DeKoe, who married Thomas Kostura\noutside their home state, had served in the military in Afghanistan for a year and\nis in the Army Reserves full time.20 5 In brief but notable terms, Kennedy draws\nout features such as their careers, their military affiliations, their dutiful\ncaretaking, their devotion to children, and their commitment to and love for their\nrespective spouses-features that Godsoe later flags in her archetype-as\nproxies of who these litigants are: respectable same-sex couples who embody the\nsame characteristics of outstanding, exemplary heterosexual citizens and who\nwould not threaten or \"demean\" the institution of marriage. In fact, they are\nrespectable and normal enough that perhaps they would even fortify marriage.\nKennedy notes, \"[t]heir stories reveal that they seek not to denigrate marriage\n200.

With sincere and heart-\nwrenching flair, Kennedy describes the lengths to which Obergefell and his\nhusband John Arthur had to go in order to obtain their out-of-state marriage\nbecause their home state of Ohio would not recognize them. 207 Arthur's\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis made it difficult for the couple to wed anywhere\nelse but on a medical transport plane on a Baltimore tarmac.20 8 But after Arthur's\ndeath, Obergefell is erased from his deceased husband's death certificate-both\nmen required on paper to \"remain strangers even in death\" because Ohio had not\nrecognized same-sex marriages. 20 9 Likewise, unable to marry and thus legally\nadopt together, lesbian couple, DeBoer and Rowse, faced losing their children if\n\"tragedy [were] to befall\" one of them.210 Sergeant DeKoe's military service and\npatriotism ought to have leveraged Tennessee's recognition of his marriage to\nKostura in New York state, but instead \"their lawful [out-of-state] marriage\n[wa]s stripped from them whenever they reside[d] in Tennessee, returning and\ndisappearing as they travel[ed] across state lines. 211 Invariably, one could gleam\nfrom this section of Obergefell that Kennedy sees the interests of same-sex\ncouples in obtaining marriage rights as converging with mainstream interests to\nprotect marriage from denigration. Their respectability lessens any demeaning\nthreat to marriage, and in fact should signal to society at large their legal and\nsymbolic need to be protected by marriage. Consequently, the interests of same-\nsex couples and the mainstream over marriage seem to align.\nSecondly, to further underscore interest convergence, Kennedy finds same-\nsex couples respectable in other ways by narrating a transformative history of\ngay and lesbians post-World War II. He first notes how society \"did not deem\nhomosexuals to have dignity in their own distinct identity. 212 He mentions that\ninitially their \"just claim to dignity was in conflict with both law and widespread\nsocial conventions ' 213 and referenced laws against sodomy and policies of\nsexual orientation discrimination to illustrate.21 4 But a major transition begins,\naccording to Kennedy, when homosexuality was no longer considered a\n206.

First, his observation switches\nfrom focusing on sexual minorities as individuals to same-sex couples. Secondly,\nthe public visibility of same-sex couples (rather than of LGBTQ individuals) that\nhe characterizes does not appear as a liberationist gesture of visibility, but is\nattenuated by his curious attention to same-sex couples' \"establishing\nfamilies\"--as if during the moment same-sex couples began to live more openly,\nthey also started having families. In this way, Kennedy draws the line between\nsame-sex couples and respectability, aligning them with norms of the\nmainstream heterosexual status quo. In part, this visibility and embrace of family\nseems to suggest, in Kennedy's view, the \"shift in public attitudes toward greater\ntolerance\" of same-sex couples. 21 7 Their open lives did not threaten or transform\nmainstream society, but rather embraced it. In its exchange, an important degree\nof societal tolerance was begotten.\nThe significance of Kennedy's historical rendering here again reveals that\nrespectability is the impetus for social recognition of sexual minorities. The\nfamilies that Kennedy mentions same-sex couples were establishing could not\nbe interpreted in any likely sense other than resembling \"good\" mainstream ones.\nHe seems to suggest that same-sex couples were exemplary in this stroke to\nbecome family-oriented. But writing from his position on the Court, as\nrepresenting an elite demographic, and addressing the American public, his\ndescription of \"establishing families\" would not likely have referred to visibly\nqueer ones. In this way, he implies that same-sex couples appear respectable in\ntheir desires to embrace mainstream values and norms, and as such, their\npresence and existence in society is non-threatening-and would be non-\nthreatening in marriage as well. In fact, at the end of Kennedy's historicism, just\nbefore he reaches the opinion's most significant portion on due process and\ndignity, he emphasizes respectability with his recount of why Windsor, the prior\nsame-sex marriage case, overturned the DOMA: \"DOMA . . . impermissibly\ndisparaged those same-sex couples 'who wanted to affirm their commitment to\none another before their children, their family, their friends, and their\ncommunity.\"21 Again, as with Kennedy's individual portrayals of some of the\nObergefell plaintiffs, he draws on the respectable vision of same-sex couples to\ndemonstrate that they would not threaten or tarnish the institution of marriage.\n215.

Again, respectability prompted\ninterests to converge.\n3. Interest Convergence and Dignity Jurisprudence\nBecause respectability solicits converging interests by allowing Kennedy to\nfind same-sex couples non-threatening to marriage, he proceeds in Obergefell to\nextend to same-sex couples the right to marry. To accomplish this extension,\nKennedy insists that legal exclusion from marriage discriminates against same-\nsex couples. He does so through showing that exclusion harms same-sex couples\nby leaving them undignified; in the other words, he shows discriminatory harm\nby invoking dignity.\nThe relationship between the interest convergence that Kennedy seems to\nportray in Obergefell and his dignity analysis is significant here. Interest\nconvergence, by way of respectability, accesses his dignity jurisprudence. In\nshort, in Kennedy's opinion, the subterranean logic for extending the marriage\nright to same-sex couples in Obergefell appears like this: Same-sex couples who\nwant marriage are respectable and thus non-threatening enough to harm\nmarriage, which aligns their interests with status-quo interests in protecting\nmarriage; in this regard, embodying such similarities to opposite-sex couples\nthrough their respectability, same-sex couples deserve legal recognition of\nmarriage, or otherwise such exclusion leaves them undignified or lacking\ndignity.\nIn Lawrence and Windsor, Kennedy relied on human dignity to demonstrate\nthat dignitary harms led to discriminatory injury in the realm of criminalized\nconsensual sex acts and federal recognition of marriage through DOMA.219 As\nKreis, Nourafshan, and Onwuachi-Willig have all noted, interest convergence\nhas worked in the background of those cases to help reach legal outcomes that\nrule in favor of sexual minorities and same-sex couples. 22 ' Here, specifically in\nObergefell, interest convergence--established through the respectable and non-\nthreatening presence of same-sex couples-allows Kennedy to draw the\ninference that exclusion from marriage incites undignified results that prove\ndiscriminatory. In this way, Kennedy's version of human dignity does not\n219. Lawrence v.

Kreis, supra note 119, at 147-53; Nourafshan & Onwuachi-Willig, supra note 67, at 522.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nresemble the Kantian notion of dignity that human worth is inherent and ought\nto be respected accordingly.221 Instead, his view of dignity is tied to a view of\ndignity supplied by social and political rank and status.222 Respectability, which\nis materially preoccupied with status, would seem to be compatible for building\na case that not having the legal right to marry would be unjustifiably undignified\nand discriminatorily harmful.\nThe ascendancy of same-sex couples in respectability and social standing\ndrawn in Kennedy's short account of gay and lesbian political history in\nObergefell-in short, the realized interest convergence-sets up the dignity crux\nof his Fourteenth Amendment analysis. Speaking with the status quo \"we,\"\nKennedy begins the section with the impetus on recognition: \"The nature of\ninjustice is that we may not always see it in our own times.\"223 However, \"[w]hen\nnew insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a\nreceived legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed. ' 224 Such new\ninsight appears when he applies the four reasons why marriage is considered a\nfundamental right to same-sex couples--couples who do not have legal\nrecognition of marriage but, as he has drawn, resemble opposite-sex couples in\nother mainstream and respectable ways adequately enough that they should\nreceive that right.\nFirst, he discusses implications for personal autonomy in having the choice\nto marry. He finds that, because \"[t]here is dignity in the bond between two men\nor two women who seek to marry and in their autonomy to make such profound\nchoices,\" 25 the exclusion from this \"right to personal choice regarding\nmarriage\" 226 lessens autonomy but also lessens same-sex couples' commitment\nin relationships in comparison to opposite-sex couples.227 Marriage as an option\nfor committed couples has a dignifying premise; without this choice, same-sex\ncouples, as respectable and non-threatening as they are, appear to suffer some\nprofound but implicit sense of injustice represented by unjustified harms to\ndignity.\n221. See IMMANUEL KANT, THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS 209 (Mary J. Gregor ed. & trans., Cambridge\nUniv. Press 1996) (1797) (\"Humanity itself is a dignity; for a human being cannot be used merely\nas a means by any human being (either by others or even by himself) but must always be used at the\nsame time as an end.\").\n222.

Id.\n[Vol. 31.2:249282\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nSecondly, marriage dignifies the close bond and intimacy of monogamous\ncouples. 228 Underscoring the \"intimate associations\" that marriage provided and\nprotected for couples in Griswold v. Connecticut and Turner v. Safley, Kennedy\nasserts that \"[t]he right to marry thus dignifies couples who 'wish to define\nthemselves by their commitment to each other.' ' 229 Marriage dignifies the\ncommitment and intimate association of couples; and if Kennedy is relying on\nthe illustration that the same-sex couples possess a redeeming respectability and\ntheir relationships do not pose a threat to marriage, then same-sex couples,\nwithout the right to marry, remain undignified as far as being able to protect their\ncloseness and privacy. Same-sex couples are left undignified despite their\nrespectability. Again, interest convergence accesses Kennedy's dignity\njurisprudence.\nKennedy's noted third principle for the fundamental right to marry involves\nhow marriage protects children and families. The right to marry provides\nmaterial security to children and families.230 But marriage dignifies families as\nwell.231 This principle appears consonant with the Obergefell plaintiffs' heavy\ninvolvement with child-rearing and caretaking, which is in line with their\nrespectability branding. What is interesting about Kennedy's connection\nbetween the exclusion of marriage and how it leaves same-sex couples\nundignified here in terms of family is that, despite their commitments to raising\nchildren, despite interest convergence, Kennedy articulates that the lack of\ndignity transfers to the children raised by same-sex couples: \"Without the\nrecognition, stability, and predictability marriage offers, [children of same-sex\ncouples] suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser.\"232\nEven their children would suffer \"harm and humiliat[ion].,, 233 This argument\nworks well to dramatize the stigma of children--that indignity, indeed-if we\ncan accept the inference that same-sex couples' respectability in raising families\nwith conscious deference to mainstream family values comports with the status\nquo's interest to protect marriage. 34 Consequently, interest convergence brings\n228.

Id.\n233. Id. at 2601.\n234. Kennedy accepts this premise. Indeed, he writes, \"As all parties agree, many same-sex couples\nprovide loving and nurturing homes to their children, whether biological or adopted. And hundreds\nof thousands of children are presently being raised by such couples.\" Id. at 2600. Moreover, adoption\nrights for gays and lesbians in certain states \"provide[] powerful confirmation from the law itself\nthat gays and lesbians can create loving, supportive families.\" Id.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nabout another rhetorical effect that raises dignity concerns in same-sex couples'\nexclusion from marriage.\nFinally, in the last principle discussed, interest convergence again proves\nhelpful for illustrating same-sex couple's dignitary harms. \"[M]arriage is a\nkeystone of our social order, ' 23 Kennedy writes to depict the status and social\nstanding marriage afforded couples: \"[Wlust as a couple vows to support each\nother, so does society pledge to support the couple, offering symbolic recognition\nand material benefits to protect and nourish the union.\"236 Because of its high\nregard and its social and material potency, marriage dignifies couples with a\nsocial and legal standing in the most premier fashion. Kennedy recites a litany\nof benefits that states attach to marital status to justify his point.237 Through\ninterest convergence, however, Kennedy observes that same-sex couples are\nharmed by the exclusion from this social and legal standing of marriage. He\nwrites:\nThere is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with\nrespect to this principle. Yet by virtue of their exclusion from that\ninstitution, same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that\nthe States have linked to marriage. This harm results in more than just\nmaterial burdens. Same-sex couples are consigned to an instability\nmany opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives..\n[This exclusion] demeans gays and lesbians for the State to lock them\nout of a central institution of the Nation's society.238\nInterest convergence, established by respectability, lurks in the background of\nKennedy's observations. Having found same-sex couples non-threatening to\nmarriage, having found them respectable in the prior sections of his opinion, he\ndirectly notes how similar same-sex couples are to opposite-sex couples in\nrespect to their relationships and desire to obtain marriage. In this way, interest\nconvergence, through respectability, draws out that inequality by showing how\nexclusion \"demeans\" same-sex couples-in other words, offends their dignity.\nUpon establishing all of this, Kennedy is able to proclaim that \"[s]ame-sex\ncouples, too, may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage and seek\nfulfillment in its highest meaning.\"239\nEven more so than Windsor, Obergefell demonstrates the line from mere\nassimilationist strategies in marriage to respectability branding and finally\ninterest convergence in the movement's successful achievement of marriage\nequality. As Kennedy adopts the respectable vision of same-sex couples in\nObergefell, he also realizes the convergence of interests to allow access to his\n235. Id. at 2601.\n236. Id.\n237. Id.\n238.

Thus, the discussion above theorizes the extent to which assimilationist\nstrategies eventually operated to actualize the doctrinal and constitutional\nunderpinnings of extending marriage to same-sex couples.\nOf course, marriage equality was momentous for same-sex couples because\nof the rights and benefits that same-sex couples and their families can receive\nthrough marriage. But because marriage rights were achieved through\nassimilationist strategies that eventually aligned interests between respectable\nsexual minorities and the establishment, such achievements seem to have more\nlikely folded same-sex couples into the heteronormative institution of marriage\nrather than give same-sex couples more opportunity to transform the institution\nin a dynamic way.\nLooking at this issue from another angle, then, assimilationist strategies\nseem to have produced a limiting effect on successes for sexual minorities on the\nwhole. What happens when sexual minorities who do not fit the mold of\nrespectability, who did not possess assimilated characteristics, appear before the\nstatus quo to seek redress of rights? What about qualities of sexual minorities\nthat show differences that matter in cases of sexual orientation discrimination?\nWhat happens when interests between sexual minorities and the establishment\ndo not converge? Considered this way, the contours of formal equality from\nrecent advancement in gay rights seem problematic. 240 The reliance on\nrespectability within such advances for formal equality for sexual minorities\nnormatively makes formal equality less than ideal-somewhat pernicious\neven-as a form of equality.\nThis could be seen in the doctrinal limits that sameness arguments and\ninterest convergence have produced in recent advances at the Supreme Court.\nFor instance, in Windsor, Kennedy essentially replicated and extended his use of\nrationality with bite from Romer.241 While in Obergefell, he extended the right\nto marry primarily based on Fourteenth Amendment due process\nconsiderations-reflective of a similar stroke he used in Lawrence-and left a\nvery thin equality jurisprudence hinged again on due process considerations, not\non any scrutiny analysis. 242 As Kreis remarked about lower district and appellate\n240. See, e.g., Nourafshan & Onwuachi-Willig, supra note 67, at 523 (\"[l]f associating whiteness and\nwealth with homosexuality has in fact helped gays and lesbians make strides toward equality, then\nthe inverse implication is that the public will not be particularly responsive to concerns that exist for\ngays and lesbians of color, especially those who are poor or working class.\").\n241.

None of these cases propelled sexual\norientation into suspect or quasi-suspect terrain. That prospect remained elusive\neven after Obergefell' s significant win for marriage proponents.\nIn that way, assimilation and sameness have a plateauing limit as Bell's\ninterest-convergence thesis demonstrated: \"So long as the interests ofjudges and\nWhite elites remain converged with the interest of the LGBT community due to\na perceived common intersection of identity, and so long as remedies for LGBT\ndiscrimination do not undermine heteronormative interests, LGBT rights will\nultimately prevail. 244 Post-Obergefell, assimilationist strategies have proved to\nbe an obstacle in future advances for true equality. According to Kreis's take on\ninterest convergence, gay rights will only prevail so long as interests are aligned\nand reparations for discrimination do not disturb the status quo.245 In similar\nfashion, Joshi has noted that advances for sexual minorities will stall or regress\nif sexual minorities are no longer presented as respectable.2 46 Such a result could\nsignify that the progress for advancing sexual minorities has stalled since\nObergefell and will likely taper unless a transformative strategy intervenes. As\nPart II will show, that stagnancy is apparent in aspects of the Masterpiece\ndecision.\nII. UNALIGNED INTERESTS IN MASTERPIECE\nThe Masterpiece dispute originated in 2012 when Charlie Craig and David\nMullins, a same-sex couple in Colorado, tried to order a custom-made wedding\ncake from Masterpiece Cakeshop and its owner-baker, Jack Phillips. 247 Because\nColorado did not recognize same-sex marriages at the time, Craig and Mullins\nhad planned to marry lawfully in Massachusetts and then return to Colorado to\ncelebrate their out-of-state marriage. 248 A custom-ordered wedding cake from\n243.

In essence, they affirmatively challenged the assimilated image of\nnormalcy the Obergefell plaintiffs had embodied and curtailed any sameness\narguments to be made for successfully increasing the levels of respectability and\ninterest convergence. One way to perceive them is that they are \"more queer\"\nthan \"gay.\" The notion of \"queerness\" itself evades a concrete and stabledefinition,257 and it is indeed theoretically less stable than the terms \"gay and\nlesbian\"--which, in recent decades, have taken on more mainstream\nassociations.258 Unlike \"gay and lesbian,\" the terminology \"queer\" does not\nmerely describe sexual practices or demarcate certain traits, features, or\nconventions of same-sex lifestyles or practices; instead, whatever features that\nembody \"queerness\" defy such identity-oriented classifications and exist as a\nmeans for \"a destabilization of heterosexual hegemony. '259 Applying queerness\nto Craig and Mullins's public personas, this observation could affirm and explain\nhow their sexualities appeared more destabilizing to members of the Supreme\nCourt than the Obergefell plaintiffs did previously.\nOne might find Craig and Mullins \"more queer\" by using Godsoe's\ncategories for assimilation and respectability to differentiate them from the\nObergefell plaintiffs. Substantially missing from Craig and Mullins' public\npersonas were characteristics that would have easily fallen within any of\nGodsoe's four assimilative archetypal traits of respectability in Obergefell: (1)\nprojections of all-Americanness; (2) asexuality; (3) child-rearing or caretaking\n257.

Consequently, as discussed below,\nmajor aspects of their public personas-their lifestyle, images, dress,\npersonalities, political motivations, perceived dissociation from family values,\noccupations, and the like--destabilized both heteronormative associations of\nsexuality and connotations from mainstream gay assimilated culture as well.\nFrom there, the dissonance-generated from their queerness--could quite\npossibly be taken as a threat to the status quo's norms regarding sexuality and\nrespectable minorities. In addition, because Craig and Mullins's CADA\ncomplaint claimed discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation in the\ncontext of marriage, their respectability could be judged against both respectable\ndifferent-sex couples and respectable sexual minorities, as others have noted that\nrespectability images of gay and lesbians had been constructed both within\nrelationships and marriage, and beyond.2 61 In both cases, a profound sense of\nthreat could have provoked the Court's much less sympathetic reaction in\nMasterpiece, ultimately deeming the couple unworthy of social and legal\nrecognition.\n1. Not Mainstream All-American\nFirst, the couple here appears less mainstream or \"all-American\" than the\nObergefell plaintiffs. Neither of them have jobs or careers that would survive a\njudgmental, status-driven scrutiny; neither of them have careers comparable to\nthose held by the Obergefell plaintiffs that Godsoe had termed \"eminently\nrespectable. 262 During the case, only one of the two, Mullins, had professional\nemployment, and that was as an office manager at a real estate firm rather than\na job that would connote to the status quo membership in a respectable\nprofessional class.26 3 Craig, meanwhile, was not employed despite his interior\ndesign training; during the years of the Masterpiece litigation he had stalled in\nlaunching his career.264 Also, to deviate further from perceived respectability,\nMullins, aside from his day-job as an office manager, admitted to harboring\n260.

On the surface, however, their professional and class identities vastly\ndeviated from the upper-middle-class, \"all-American\" image of prior marriage-\nequality plaintiffs.\nCulturally, Craig and Mullins also did not embody \"all-American\" identities,\nnor did they project themselves as \"Leave It to Beaver\"-types-borrowing from\nGodsoe's phraseology. Neither seemed to have served in the military and thus\nwould lack the easy connotation that service could offer for creating a\nconventional sense of patriotism. 267 In their physical appearances, Craig and\nMullins did not exhibit the \"gendered\" norms of hetero-masculinity typical of a\n\"Leave It to Beaver,\" traditionally all-American world. Various media\nphotographs of the couple during their litigation depicted them adhering less to\na \"straightacting,\" hetero-masculine script.

Often the couple was photographed wearing flashy, ostentatious\nclothing and alternative jewelry.272 Instead of keeping a stable sense of physical\nappearance, they varied their hair and grooming-especially Mullins who\nappeared from one photographical moment to the next altering his hair color and\nlength, maintaining what some might deem a more \"androgynous\" look.273\nMeanwhile, Craig often sported a sharply-trimmed beard and would seem to be\nthe less androgynous of the two, but he also changed his hair color from time to\ntime.274 Compared to traditional, unwavering notions of all-American maleness,\nfrequent variations in appearances would connote destabilizing \"gendered\"\ncharacteristics and even personality traits of instability, or a lack of sense of self.\nIn contrast with the Obergefell plaintiffs, Craig and Mullins projected an image\nthat suggested they were not doing \"exactly the same things as everyone else\ndoes.

Not Asexual\nSecondly, unlike the Obergefell plaintiffs, Craig and Mullins did not obscure\nor hide their sexuality. Many of the couple's public photos offered examples of\nthem not shying away from affectionate gestures that could remind the public of\ntheir same-sex sexual desires or attractions. Often they were photographed in\nloving poses-ranging from holding hands 277 and slight, suggestive\nembracing 278 all the way to mouth-to-mouth kissing 279-- even kissing on the\nsteps of the Supreme Court.280 Their photograph in an NBC News feature in\nDecember 2017 depicted them casually but affectionately huddled together in a\npublic setting-Mullins with his body and legs curled in a loose but upright fetal\nposition against Craig, who was closely flanked and attentive to cradling\nMullins. 281 Noticeably, Craig's right hand was reaching over the bottom of\nMullins' thighs while his left hand was draped over the space between his own\nopen legs, covering his genitals.282 Another photograph with Politico showing\nthe couple kissing seemed to have been done with a bit of provocative intent.283\nIn addition to their visual displays of same-sex affection, the couple also\ndiscussed their physical affections publicly. In one interview, Mullins even\nrecounted a personal experience of gay public affection with a previous lover as\nboth a liberating life event and a moment of personal bravery and pride,\nand that the stigma attached to this kind of person should be removed.

'285 In their NBC news interview, the\ncouple revealed that their decision to marry came during an intimate moment\nwhile \"[t]hey were cuddling on their couch. 286 From that statement, one could\nfacetiously interpret that the entire case of Masterpiece might not have resulted,\nbut for this one moment of intimacy.\nAlthough public displays of affection between opposite-sex couples are so\nfrequent as to render them commonplace, if one situated Craig and Mullins's\naffectionate gestures back into the hands (and bodies) of a male same-sex couple,\ntheir gestures could have appeared unfamiliar, unnatural, or jarring enough to\nsome in the mainstream that such displays seemed threatening on several levels.\nFirst, Craig and Mullins's public displays of affection could seem antithetical to\nthe image of the respectable gay couple that has been built up, for instance, by\nthe desexualized, assimilated impressions left by the Obergefell plaintiffs. 287\nCraig and Mullins's public gestures risked reminding the world of their sexuality\nand hinted at consensual intimacy behind closed doors. In that way, their public\ndisplays of affection would have violated the tenets of gay respectability.\nAccording to Joshi, \"[l]esbians and gays may produce performances of\nrespectability as defensive strategies against being sexualized. Respectability\nmay be a means of stopping their sexuality from becoming a barrier to their\nsuccess and happiness or a safe space away from the pain and suffering of\nhomophobia. 288 In comparison to any notions of assimilation; Craig and\nMullins's public displays of affection could have been interpreted as flaunting-\na heightened reaction of threat even though Lawrence had legally sanctioned\neven the most intimate forms of such acts between same-sex couples.\nOn another level, their affection also had the potential to risk distinguishing\ntheir sex acts from those of opposite-sex couples. The image of two men being\naffectionate with each other rather than the image of a man and a woman doing\nthe same could have triggered responses that distinguished consensual same-sex\nintimacy from consensual acts of opposite-sex intimacy: one way to do so would\nbe by focusing on the latter's procreative agency.289 Such images could also\ndistinguish consensual same-sex intimacy by triggering stereotypical\n284.

Such imagery and affectionate public displays reinforced\ntheir sexuality, enhanced the danger for social distinction, and perhaps even\nprovoked homophobic reactions. This effect would undo the sameness\narguments within gay assimilationist tactics and engender heteronormative\nshaming or disapproval.\n3. Not Family-Oriented Caretakers\nAccording to Godsoe, involvement in child-rearing or family caretaking was\nthe third archetypal characteristic of respectability the Obergefell plaintiffs\ndisplayed.291 By contrast, in the public revelations about their lives, the\nMasterpiece plaintiffs made no mention of child-rearing or caretaking of a loved\none-neither Craig or Mullins seemed to have any adopted or biological\nchildren, nor did they seem involved in caretaking of a family member; instead\nCraig and Mullins projected the image of a young, mobile couple who traveled,\nattended media parties, and were essentially carefree from familial\nresponsibilities than the same-sex couples in Obergefell.292 Thus, they did not\nconform to the image of domestic and family values that the Obergefell plaintiffs\nprojected.293 In Craig and Mullins's case, their lack of attachment to a domestic,\nfamily-oriented lifestyle left their lives up for alternative interpretations. In\ncontrast to the effect that caregiving had on further \"desexualizing\" the\nObergefell plaintiffs and their relationships, the lack of caregiving or child-\nrearing here could have had the opposite effect. It suggested that Craig and\nMullins had less domesticated lives and were more easily differentiated from\n\"respectable\" or responsible gay couples who do have children or take care of\nsick dependents. They seemed more hedonistic than the Obergefell plaintiffs-\nless selfless with their time and resources than gay couples helping to rear\n290.

Not Accidental Activists\nLastly, although Craig and Mullins have claimed that they were-as the\nObergefell plaintiffs had been-\"accidental activists,\" 295 they seemed\ninconsistent during interviews about just how \"accidental\" they were. First, they\ncontradicted their own claims that they had no prior interest in LGBTQ activism.\nDuring interviews, they mentioned that they both \"actually tried to avoid politics\nwhen they decided to get married ' 296 and they \"were never activists in the gay\nrights movement. 297 That seemed more true for Mullins, who claimed he\n\"considered himself apolitical until the day he and Craig were turned away at\nMasterpiece Cakeshop.\" 298 But in another interview with Craig, it was revealed\nthat he did harbor some prior activist experiences: \"Craig, an alumnus of\nUniversity of Wyoming in Laramie, said 15 years ago he was a board member\nof a student LGBT group that sought to raise awareness for the Matthew Shepard\nFoundation and HIV testing.\"299 In fact, whether true or not, Craig seemed to\nharbor latent motives for activism; early experiences of being ostracized for his\nsexuality were \"hardships\" that eventually \"pushed him to fight for himself on\nthe cake case.\" 300 Secondly, the act of pursuing a case of sexual orientation\ndiscrimination against Phillips and the bakery intrinsically seemed like a\ndeliberate gesture of activism. Of course, the slippery slope emerges to interpret\nany act of litigation, small or large, as an act of premeditated activism. But the\nfocus of this category is less on the truth of whether the couple was purposeful\nor not in their CADA complaint. The focus, rather, is how militant they could be\nseen in the mainstream's eye-given the kind of unconscious bias that exists\nagainst queer individuals, and the negative stereotypes that conflate queer\nidentities with radical activism.30' Thus, from an establishment perspective, one\ncould, with some implicit bias, project militancy from the series of events\n294.

Taking their story to social media instead could have been read\nas attention-seeking. The Facebook post led Mullins and Craig to the discovery\nthat Colorado public accommodations law afforded them recourse.30 3 They got\ntheir wedding cake from another bakery.304 Then the Lambda Legal Defense\nFund and the ACLU became involved in their case.305 According to Mullins,\n\"[e]ventually, someone at the ACLU found us and we spoke to them, and we\ndecided to move forward to the complaint .... They sort of helped us file the\npaperwork a little bit, and then after that and much discussion on their part, they\ndecided to take up the case.\"\n30 6\nDuring their Supreme Court litigation, the couple participated very publicly.\nUntil the decision was rendered, they had given over three hundreds interviews,\nincluding interviews with major news outlets. 30 7 They were honored with the\nVH- 1 Trailblazer Award for their \"public fight against LGBTQ\ndiscrimination. ' 30 8 Unlike some plaintiffs in prior gay rights cases, such as\nLawrence v. Texas, both Craig and Mullins noticeably attended the oral\narguments at the Supreme Court. 309 While in Washington, D.C. for the\narguments, they made speeches at several rallies 310 and said they felt that \"it's\nimportant for people to see us just for the fact of we're standing up for\nourselves.\" 311 It was by chance that Craig and Mullins experienced\ndiscrimination at the Masterpiece Cakeshop; they had not expected Phillips to\nrefuse them based on his religious beliefs.312 Some of the facts of the case had\naccidental elements.

Id.\n[Vol. 31.2:249\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nof the LGBTQ community beyond their own lawsuit, Mullins remarked with a\nkeen sense of political acumen, saying:\nThe three changes I see happening that most inspire me are the\naggressive dismantling of the gender binary, the embrace of\nintersectionality, and the push to make sure that marginalized voices,\nthe voices of transgender individuals, of non-white people, of women,\nare not silenced or filtered through the experiences of their cisgender,\nwhite male counterparts.3 13\nWith less detail, but sharing a similar political tone, Craig responded to the same\nquestion with his analysis about gay visibility, stating:\nFor a long time the concept of fitting in was really important and for\ngood reason. Now, that we are becoming more accepted by the public\nin general, I see more people embracing their individuality, and showing\nthat our differences are what make our culture unique. Pride month\ngives the necessary visibility to our shared humanity. 314\nThese seemingly liberationist remarks reflected their admission after the\nSupreme Court decision was rendered that \"they are lifetime activists now.\"315\nAt that point, one could, with an implicitly biased viewpoint, think that the\ncouple was less \"accidental\" or reluctant in their activism-or find them\ndisingenuous if they were to claim to be reluctant or \"accidental.\" They\ninadvertently lent an image of willingness in their challenge of sexual orientation\ndiscrimination against them personally and pursued it as part of a comprehensive\npolitical impetus for change. From this, one could surmise that for them the\npersonal had become political.\nB. Preserving the Status Quo\nFailing to satisfy each of Godsoe's underscored characteristics of\nassimilation likely prevented Craig and Mullins from manifesting the version of\ngay assimilation and respectability propagated in the marriage cases.\nConsequently, the couple could not avail themselves as readily to the sameness\narguments nor respectability branding that the Obergefell plaintiffs used in\nmaking their collective case for marriage equality. They would have failed to\nappear \"normal\" enough to be recognized or protected within establishment\nstandards and values. In fact, they would have threatened the idea of what\n\"normal\" entails. Their inability to seem respectable because of their perceived\nqueerness affected the chances that their interests would substantively align with\n313. Shorey & Reddish, supra note 284.\n314. Id.\n315. Sherry, supra note 263.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nthe Court's interests in affirming or protecting the status quo.316 Their queerness\nchallenged and threatened the status quo precisely through that inability as\nminorities to seem respectable under establishment norms. First, their queerness\ndid not fit the norms of respectability governing gender and sexuality,\nsocioeconomics, family choices, and minority political participation, and to seek\nlegal protection under CADA is essentially seeking recognition of their\nqueerness. Secondly, because Phillips's religious views were involved in the\nclaim, the couple's request for recognition also directly challenged religious\nfreedoms and values that the status quo embraces-freedoms and values that\nsubstantively reinforce norms of sexuality and respectability. Thus, on both\nlevels, Craig and Mullins's lack of respectability weakened any interests within\nthe mainstream because, rather than seeming respectable and worthy of\nrecognition, they challenged and threatened the status quo. Accordingly, the\nfocus of the opinion was heavily on Phillips's religious freedom-and by\nextension reinforcing the discriminatory status quo-even when Phillips did not\nfit within any religious protections under CADA. Reactions to Craig and Mullins\nas threats to the status quo are discussed below, showing that the Court\neventually reinforced its interest in preserving the status quo against any interest\nin protecting the couple's queerness.\n1. Distancing from Dignity Jurisprudence\nWithout appearing assimilated, Craig and Mullins were unable to avail\nthemselves to Kennedy's dignity jurisprudence to the extent that marriage-\nequality plaintiffs in Obergefell and Windsor previously had. In Masterpiece,\nCraig and Mullins's lack of comparable respectable traits offered fewer\nopportunities for the couple to align their interests with those of the status quo.\nThere was little incentive for the mainstream to recognize and protect the couple.\nIn this way, this failure of interest convergence led to their exclusion from\nKennedy's dignity paradigm. Unlike Obergefell, where interest convergence\naccessed Kennedy's dignity jurisprudence, here the lack of interest convergence\nand the perceived threats the couple posed permitted Kennedy to portray them\nas rightfully undignified.\nFirst, Kennedy accomplishes this portrayal by virtually committing the\nopposite of what he had done in his Obergefell opinion, where he specifically\ntried to humanize Jim Obergefell and the other couples. Compared to the way he\nhad acknowledged sympathetically some of the personal details of select\n316. In his study of interest convergence in Lawrence, Kreis argues that the interest convergence that\ntook place in Lawrence involved a perception that a sequence of threats to heteronormative and\nestablishment values had been overcome. Kreis, supra note 119, at 147-52. This observation\nsuggests that challenges involving recognition of sexual minorities would likely involve appeasing\nthose who wish to defend the status quo.\n[Vol. 31.2:249298\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nObergefell plaintiffs, here Kennedy avoids mentioning Craig and Mullins's\npersonal characteristics in any specific and meaningful way. He only mentions\nCraig and Mullins minimally, and when he does, it is transactional, to recite\neither procedure 317 or relevant facts.318 Such brief passages of acknowledgment\nare devoid of any significant, personalizing descriptions. Kennedy refuses to\nexplore just how being denied a wedding cake as a same-sex couple demeaned\nthe couple's human dignities. There are no extrapolations of unjustified\nindignity-no dramatizations akin to those in Obergefell involving medical\ntransport planes or missing names on death certificates. 319 Instead, the only\npassages that bring up the possibility that sexual orientation discrimination can\nresult in violating human dignity or stigma are in two brief sections when\nKennedy postulates about gay couples and individuals in the abstract. 320 To\nKennedy, it seems quite possible that gay people can be unjustifiably demeaned\nin the marketplace if denied goods and services. 321 But he never applies such\nabstractions to Craig and Mullins's sexual orientation discrimination claim.\nThus, Craig and Mullins stand outside of those circumstances. Motivating this\nsilent denial might be the lack of sameness and respectability in Craig and\nMullins' identities, compared to litigants in the prior gay rights cases-\nparticularly in the marriage context, even though Craig and Mullins were asking\nfor an item (a wedding cake) that resides typically and symbolically as the apex\nof \"respectable\" or assimilating purchases for wedded couples. There is nothing\nas redeeming or worthy enough about this couple to consider them otherwise.\nThere is nothing worth mentioning to show that they were unjustifiably\ndemeaned.\nSecondly, not only does Kennedy demonstrate that are they not worthy of\nrecognition, but even before presenting the issues, Kennedy attempts to insinuate\nthat what Craig and Mullins had requested from Phillips was somewhat\nillegitimate and, as a result, portrayed the couple in a justifiably undignified light.\nBeyond reciting that Phillips had denied Craig and Mullins's request for a\ncustom wedding cake because of his religious views against same-sex marriages,\nKennedy noted separately that Colorado had not recognized same-sex marriages\nat the time. 32 2 This observation directs attention off Craig and Mullins' sexual\nidentities, which CADA protects, and suggests illicit conduct that would\n317.

Id. at 1723 (\"The shop's owner told the couple that he would not create a cake for their wedding\nbecause of his religious opposition to same-sex marriages-marriages the State of Colorado itself\ndid not recognize at that time.\").\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\ninvariably bolster or support Phillips's discriminatory refusal; after all, Craig and\nMullins had been legally married in Massachusetts and were not officially\nseeking to be recognized as a married couple in Colorado at the time. 323 The cake\nwas merely desired for celebrating that occasion.3 24 This slight reference that\nColorado was not a marriage-equality state at the time the couple ordered the\ncake from Phillips does not reflect their true intentions; instead it misconstrues\nthe facts and poses the dubious effect of insinuating that Craig and Mullins were\nasking for something from Phillips that they were not legally entitled to and,\nunder that logic, that Phillips would have been complicit had he agreed to their\ncake request. In reality, all they wanted was cake; Craig and Mullins were only\nasking Phillips to create a wedding cake to celebrate their legally obtained, out-\nof-state marriage. They were not seeking Colorado's recognition of their out-of-\nstate marriage. Kennedy's factual mischaracterization is one step in denying\nCraig and Mullins' dignifying potential. After all, it would seem hard to\ndignify--or even sympathize with-individuals who were refused for seeking\nsomething that was illegal. Melissa Murray has theorized that in wedding-vendor\ncases, including prior adjudications of Masterpiece, this blurring between\nmarital and nonmarital statuses has strategic purpose:\nFor example, a claim for a religious exemption from the operation of\nantidiscrimination law may seem more plausible if the believer's\nobjections concern an institution like marriage, which has religious\nunderpinnings, rather than objections to homosexuality in general.325\nIn other words, the blurring takes the emphasis off the illegality and\nblameworthiness of Phillips's acts under CADA and shifts the focus to\nmischaracterized illegality in the couple's request for a wedding cake to celebrate\ntheir valid out-of-state Massachusetts marriage in Colorado, a state that had not\nyet recognized same-sex marriage. Seen in this way, Craig and Mullins, who\nwould seem to be seeking something illegal in Colorado under Kennedy's\nimplication here, would not deserve sympathy for harms to their dignity. In fact,\nin Kennedy's wrongful portrayal, they would seem rightfully undignified for\nappearing to ask Phillips to help recognize them for something that was illegal\nat the time.\n323. Id. at 1724. In this part of the opinion, Kennedy restates the facts more clearly and accurately than\nhe did at the beginning of Masterpiece: \"Phillips met Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins when they\nentered his shop in the summer of 2012. Craig and Mullins were planning to marry. At that time,\nColorado did not recognize same-sex marriages, so the couple planned to wed legally in\nMassachusetts and afterwards to host a reception for their family and friends in Denver.\" Id.\n324. Id.\n325. Melissa Murray, Accommodating Nonmarriage, 88 S. CAL. L. REv. 661, 662-64 (2015) (emphasis\nadded). Similarly, Kyle Velte has flagged another literary technique Kennedy deploys in\nMasterpiece, which involves his use of the word \"difficult\" or \"difficulties\" in describing the baker's\nclaims. Velte notes that such uses of these adjectives \"signals a tacit acceptance that the baker's\nargument has met a baseline standard of acceptability and legitimacy.\" Kyle C. Velte, Postponement\nas Precedent 26 (Sept. 5, 2019) (unpublished manuscript) (on file with author).\n[Vol. 31.2:249\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nConsequently, Kennedy's rhetorical techniques for dignifying individuals-\nand, with that, his entire dignity jurisprudence-evade Craig and Mullins. This\nresult stands even when their CADA claim for sexual orientation discrimination\nhad substantive merit, as attested in the lower state forums. If dignity was the\nway in which Kennedy illustrated discriminatory harm in prior gay rights cases,\nsuch as Obergefell and Windsor, then Kennedy's refusal to dignify the couple\nhere is significant. It is possibly intended to lessen any discriminatory levels of\nharm the couple suffered when Phillips denied them their custom cake order.\nRather than being just \"gay enough\" to succeed, Craig and Mullins's queerness\nseemed to have broken the boundaries that lie at the core of what assimilationist\nstrategies have done to essentialize the gay identity. The destabilizing effect of\ntheir queer sexualities undoubtedly clashed with the assimilationist images of\nlitigants in the marriage-equality cases and probably exceeded the Court's\ntolerance of gay identities as well. They just did not garner the type of\nrespectability for the Court to sympathize fully with their pursuit of formal\nequality. Instead, the couple likely threatened the status quo in a way that\nprompted Kennedy to ignore their humanity and mischaracterize the facts in\norder to portray them in an undignified light.\n2. Refraning the Issues\nTo add to Kennedy's refusal to dignify Craig and Mullins's queerness in the\nway he had dignified the gay, assimilated plaintiffs in the marriage cases, to\ndemonstrate another reaction to the perceived threat that Craig and Mullins\nrepresent, Kennedy also reframes the legal issues from how the claims had been\ndiscussed in prior forums below. The Colorado Court of Appeals had observed\nthat the dispute involved both Craig and Mullins's rights under CADA and\nPhillips's claim that his rights to speech and religious expression were violated,\nbut then very quickly dismissed Phillips's claim.326 Kennedy, on the other hand,\nbegins his majority opinion by questioning the weight of Colorado's public\naccommodations law and its respect for sexual minorities against a status quo\nthat finds religious intolerance compelling.327 Then he articulates the issues as a\nstruggle between of the level of protection for the \"rights and dignity of gay\npersons who are or wish to be, married but who face discrimination when they\nseek goods or services\" 328 and \"the right of all persons to exercise fundamental\n326. See, e.g., Craig v. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc., 370 P.3d 272,276 (Colo. Ct. App. 2015). (\"This case\njuxtaposes the rights of complainants, Charlie Craig and David Mullins, under Colorado's public\naccommodations law to obtain a wedding cake to celebrate their same-sex marriage against the rights\nof respondents, Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc., and its owner, Jack C. Phillips, who contend that\nrequiring them to provide such a wedding cake violates their constitutional rights to freedom of\nspeech and the free exercise of religion.\").\n327. Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1723.\n328. Id.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nfreedoms under the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the\nFourteenth Amendment.\" 329 As articulated above, Craig and Mullins are outside\nhis dignity jurisprudence. From here, it becomes even clearer that the decision\nwill weigh these competing interests, framed similarly. In recapitulating the\nissues thusly, Kennedy also legitimizes and raises the interest in protecting\nPhillips's free speech and religious exercise. Indeed, he is focusing on the\ninterest in preserving the status quo. First, he observes sympathetically that\nPhillips's free speech claim is \"an instructive example, however, of the\nproposition that the application of constitutional freedoms in new contexts can\ndeepen our understanding of their meaning. '\"330 Similarly, Kennedy finds that\n\"[t]he same difficulties arise in determining whether a baker has a valid free\nexercise claim.\" 331 He alludes to potentially validating Phillips's actions. In\nessence, Kennedy's effort to explain why Phillips's claims regarding free speech\nand religious exercise might pose a difficulty in this case begins to establish what\nwill be a plausible deniability that perhaps Phillips's refusal could be\nconstitutionally protected in light of Craig and Mullins's CADA discrimination\nclaim, or suggest that he regards Phillips's claims with more urgency than\nprevious venues had.33 2\nBy juxtaposing the issues and amplifying Phillips's free speech and religious\nexercise claims, Kennedy hints at his potential deference to the status quo--one\nthat is discriminatory. It seems likely that religious freedoms represent the status\nquo's interest in two ways. First, religion is a means or tactic for Kennedy to rely\nupon for defending Phillips's actions against challenges of discrimination\nbecause religion is constitutionally protected. Secondly, religion is itself an end\nbecause here Phillips's anti-gay Christian views would affirm certain hegemonic\n329. Id.\n330. Id. (\"One of the difficulties in this case is that the parties disagree as to the extent of the baker's\nrefusal to provide service. If a baker refused to design a special cake with words or images\ncelebrating the marriage-for instance, a cake showing words with religious meaning-that might\nbe different from a refusal to sell any cake at all. In defining whether a baker's creation can be\nprotected, these details might make a difference.\").\n331. Id. (\"A baker's refusal to attend the wedding to ensure that the cake is cut the right way, or a refusal\nto put certain religious words or decorations on the cake, or even a refusal to sell a cake that has\nbeen baked for the public generally but includes certain religious words or symbols on it are just\nthree examples of possibilities that seem all but endless.\").\n332. Some social science commentators have identified such plausible deniability from the vantage points\nof the status quo as a product of relative positioning and bias in the social hierarchy; in other words,\nthe dominant power will articulate what it perceives to be an objective approach on an social issue\nfrom its own position atop the hierarchy, and thus more easily consider its own conduct and part in\nthe issue with the benefit of the doubt and continue to preserve its interests. See JIM SIDANIUS &\nFELICIA PRATTO, SOCIAL DOMINANCE: AN INTERGROUP THEORY OF SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND\nOPPRESSION 43 (1999) (labeling this phenomenon explicitly as \"plausible deniability, or the ability\nto practice discrimination, while at the same time denying that any discrimination is actually taking\nplace\"); see also David Simson, Whiteness as Innocence, 96 DENV. L. REv. 635 (2019) (recognizing\nthis plausible deniability as \"whiteness as innocence\" in the context of race-conscious remediation).\nIf such plausible deniability exists within the status quo, then it is probable that this a psychological\nvantage point would supplement Bell's theory of interest convergence.\n[Vol. 31.2:249302\n2020] Queer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nideas, norms, and values about sexual orientation that the status quo is willing to\naccept and embody. After all, despite marriage equality victories and the\nincreasing positive image of sexual minorities in mainstream culture in the\nhandful of years since Lawrence, the status quo has continued to recognize\ndominant religious views and sentiments-some that invariably have led to\nsevere inequalities and legal detriments for sexual minorities and other\nmarginalized people. 333 Nevertheless, such views have received constitutional\nprotection. For instance, in the face of legal and political advances for sexual\nminorities, many states have enacted religious freedom acts.334 In the same vein,\nafter Obergefell, some states have relied on religion to motivate and legitimize\nbills that restrict restroom use for transgender people.335 And even the Supreme\nCourt has recently prioritized religion over some aspects of women's\nreproductive rights.33 6 Each of these examples shows religion as a means to\nchallenging political progress for sexual minorities and as a substantive\nreflection of status quo norms. In essence, a discriminatory status quo that is\npartly validated and perpetuated by religious freedom has received heightened\nlegal protection, and, from the beginning of Masterpiece, Kennedy raises a\nstrong interest in preserving that status quo by reframing the issues.\n333. The Supreme Court's Dunn v. Ray ruling in the 2018-2019 Term following Masterpiece exemplifies\nthe status quo's hierarchical priority for Judeo-Christian faiths over other religious faiths. See 139\nS. Ct. 661 (2019). In Dunn, officials at an Alabama prison who had previously allowed Christian\nchaplains to be present at executions on the request of the death row inmates denied one death row\ninmate's request for a Muslim imam to be present at his execution. Id. (Kagan, Ginsburg, Breyer,\nand Sotomayor, JJ., dissenting). On final appeal, the Court's majority sided with the prison on a\ntechnicality: the inmate had waited too close to his execution date to file for a stay of execution\npending the merits of a possible discrimination case. Id. (Thomas, J., majority); see also id. (Kagan,\nGinsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., dissenting). The Court denied even when the Eleventh Circuit\nCourt of Appeals had found that the denial violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\nId. Justice Kagan's dissent criticized the majority's ruling as affirming a preference in religious\ndenominations. Id. at 661-62. Commentators have found the Court's ruling in Dunn, which relies on\ntimely procedures, to be questionable in light of the substantive merits of the case.

Weighing the Preservation Interest of the Status Quo\nIn the second section of his Masterpiece opinion, Kennedy underscores the\nprimacy of protecting anti-gay religious sentiments, despite a lack of a CADA\nexemption for Phillips, and, simultaneously, he marginalizes any incentive to\nprotect Craig and Mullins's sexual identities from discriminatory harm. Kennedy\naccomplishes this in part by articulating how Craig and Mullins came up short\nin their dignified respectability. As he states, \"[o]ur society has come to the\nrecognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts\nor as inferior in dignity and worth.\" '337 At first, Kennedy seems consonant with\nhis recognition of same-sex couples in Obergefell.338 By itself, the statement\nseems absolute in terms of protecting sexual minorities. However, Kennedy\nimmediately qualifies his declaration by writing, \"For that reason the laws and\nthe Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of\ntheir civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be\ngiven great weight and respect by the courts.\" 33 9 By inserting how the\nConstitution \"can, and in some instances must\" provide sexual minorities with\ncivil rights protections, he suggests that negotiation exists at setting the level of\ninterest in which protections of civil rights based on sexual orientation are\ngiven-that there must be situations in which the Constitution has less interest\nin affording civil rights protections of sexual minorities even if their freedoms\n\"on terms equal to others\" are subject to \"great weight and respect by the\ncourts. 34° Other commentators have read this passage in the second section of\nMasterpiece Cakeshop with greater optimism because, just on these three\nsentences alone, one could read a friendly ambiguity in favor of sexual minorities\ninto Kennedy's statement.341 Such a reading, however, would ignore the series\nof further qualifications that follow in which Kennedy raises the importance of\npreserving religious views against same-sex marriages: \"At the same time, the\nreligious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and\nin some instances protected forms of expression.\" 342 Here is where Kennedy\nrepeats the disparity of interest levels. Like the protection of the civil rights of\n337. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civil Rights Comm'n, 138 S. Ct. 1719, 1727 (2018).\n338. This opening passage in Masterpiece embodies a sentiment and tone similar to Kennedy's final\nsection in Obergefell: \"As some of the petitioners in these [marriage] cases demonstrate, marriage\nembodies a love that may endure even past death .... Their hope is not to be condemned to live in\nloneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the\neyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\" Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584,\n2608 (2015).\n339. Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1727.\n340. Id.\n341.

In the commercial context, these views are subject to public\naccommodation laws and would not survive so long as such laws are general and\nneutrally applicable.343 But he does not critique how CADA itself is not general\nand neutrally applicable. There is no direct attack premised on the opinion that\nPhillips's bakery ought to have been exempted. He is just weighing the interests.\nConstitutionally, despite public accommodations legislation, Kennedy notes\nthat the law could not compel members of a religious clergy to perform same-\nsex wedding ceremonies if doing so clashes with the free exercise of religion.344\nIn fact, such protections of a clergy member's refusal, based on freedom of\nreligious exercise, to officiate a same-sex wedding ceremony is so \"well\nunderstood in our constitutional order as an exercise of religion\" that Kennedy\nsupposes sexual minorities could subordinate their rights in the face of such\nrefusal-as \"an exercise that gay persons could recognize and accept without\nserious diminishment to their own dignity and worth. 34 5 Such an overly\npresumptuous observation patronizes and ignores the indignities that sexual\nminorities have suffered at the hands of religious exclusion.3 46 Yet again, the\ndisparity of interest levels exists and is demonstrated by how Kennedy\nsubordinates the interest of protecting sexual minorities beneath the interest in\nreligious protections. The passage potentially condones certain acts of religious\nanimus against sexual minorities, placing exercise of religion over the protection\nof non-heteronormative sexual identities. This priority exists despite Kennedy's\nobservation that protection for free exercise of religion must be \"confined\"; 347\notherwise, a mass commercial refusal to provide goods and services to sexual\nminorities might lead to \"a community-wide stigma inconsistent with the history\nand dynamics of civil rights laws that ensure equal access to goods, services, and\n343.

In terms of dignity, this\ndiscussion injects a hierarchical limitation: sexual minorities deserve some\nconstitutional protection based on their dignity, but not enough to surpass some\ninstances of free religious exercise. This hierarchy resembles the Court's prior\nreluctance to raise the lower-level scrutiny analysis of sexual minorities--even\nin cases featuring assimilated and socioeconomically privileged plaintiffs, such\nas in Windsor-and reveals how the Court actually views sexual orientation as a\nprotectable trait below other protectable identity traits.34 9 Kennedy seems to\nsignal that the Masterpiece couple could not confidently use their CADA sexual\norientation discrimination claim to break through to a fuller or higher treatment\nof formal equality for civil rights protections of sexual minorities in this federal\nforum. Even when Phillips and his bakery clearly did not fall within CADA's\nreligion exemption, his religious exercise rights conflict and ought to be noted\nsubstantially enough as if he deserved exemption.\nWe see how Kennedy regards Phillips's rights when he directly examines\nPhillips's claim. In examining Phillips's account, Kennedy sides with Phillips on\nhis distinction that creating a custom-ordered cake for Craig and Mullins would\nhave used \"his artistic skill to make an expressive statement, a wedding\nendorsement in [Phillips's] own voice and of his own creation.\" 35 0 Here,\nKennedy entwines both Phillips's free speech and religious justifications for\nrefusing Craig and Mullins and finds that \"Phillips' dilemma was particularly\nunderstandable given the background and legal principles and administration of\nthe law in Colorado at that time,\" since Colorado had not yet recognized same-\nsex marriages when Phillips's refusal occurred.351 In fact, Kennedy finds that\nthere is some force to the argument that the baker was not unreasonable\nin deeming it lawful to decline to take an action that he understood to be\nan expression of support for their validity when that expression was\ncontrary to his sincerely held religious beliefs, at least insofar as his\nrefusal was limited to refusing to create and express a message in\n348.

According to Kreis, \"[t]he false perceptions of the sexual minority community as privileged are not,\nat first blush, universally beneficial in the constitutional domain.\" Kreis, supra note 119, at 160. At\nfirst, this observation seems counterintuitive, given the historical marginalization of sexual\nminorities. E.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.

However, \"[f]rom ajudge's perspective, it might very well\nbe considerably difficult to apply a more exacting level of judicial review to a class of people that\nappear privileged.

He notes the three William Jack cake cases in which the Colorado\nCivil Rights Division found it was lawful for three bakers to have separately\nrefused creating cakes that bore messages demeaning to sexual minorities or\nsame-sex marriages 353 and noted that \"[a]t the time, state law also afforded\nstorekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages the storekeeper\nconsidered offensive.\"354 All of his ruminations about the protections of sexual\nminorities and exercise of religious freedom culminates in qualifications that\nappear as if Kennedy is heavily posturing to preserve what results in the bottom\nline regarding Phillips's actions-that ultimately, despite the dignity and worth\nthe Court has previously given to sexual minorities in the marriage equality cases\nand despite how Phillips is not exempted from CADA here, formal equality for\nsexual minorities must give way to religious freedom. Essentially, the interest to\nprotect sexual orientation from discrimination is not on equal footing with the\ninterest in protecting free exercise of religion. Of course, categorical denial of\nservices and goods to sexual minorities based on a provider's religious beliefs\nwould not be condoned; however, as Kennedy recognizes, \"Phillips was entitled\nto the neutral and respectful consideration of his claims in all the circumstances\nof the case.\" 355 On Phillips's behalf, Kennedy reaches extensively to\ncomprehend Phillips's moral and religious dilemma, reading the case narrowly\nat the expense of diminishing the dignity and worth of Craig and Mullins.\nOverall, Kennedy essentially embeds a plausible deniability favoring Phillips's\nactions over the dignity of Craig and Mullins's sexual identities. Thus, he heavily\nprioritizes the interest in preserving the discriminatory status quo in order to curb\nthe threat against it.\n4. Religious Hostility\nIn truth, the tension between sexual orientation antidiscrimination and\nreligious freedom that Kennedy raises, explores, and then seemingly resolves in\nfavor of Phillips never comes to an actual determination on the merits. Kennedy\nnever proclaims the doctrinal dividing line between Phillips's religious\nobjections to same-sex marriage and the protections of Craig and Mullins's\n352. Id.\n353. Id.\n354. Id.\n355. Id. at 1729.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nsexual identities from discrimination. Masterpiece never overrules CADA. So,\nKennedy's prioritization of the interest in preserving the status quo is never given\nbinding effect. Within the factual contours of Masterpiece, Kennedy merely\nsuggests that the interest in preserving the status quo outweighs the interest in\nprotecting Craig and Mullins's sexual orientation from discrimination. On the\nsubstantive legal merits of Craig and Mullins's discrimination claim, the formal\nequality aspects would reach a favorable outcome for the couple. CADA had\nstood on the couple's side. Even Kennedy admits that CADA expressly forbids\nsexual orientation discrimination in the reaim of public accommodations.\n356\nDespite this, Kennedy effectuates preservation interest by examining the case\nprocedurally to reverse the Court of Appeals. He reviews the public hearings on\nthe matter by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and reads into the record\nreligious hostility displayed by members of the Commission sufficient for him\nto violate religious neutrality.357 Specifically, Kennedy focuses on remarks that\ndisparage personal religious beliefs:\nAt several points during its meeting, commissioners endorsed the view\nthat religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public\nsphere or commercial domain, implying that religious beliefs and\npersons are less than fully welcome in Colorado's business community.\nOne commissioner suggested that Phillips can believe \"what he wants\nto believe,\" but cannot act on his religious beliefs \"if he decides to do\nbusiness in the state.\" . . . A few moments later, the commissioner\nrestated the position: \"[I]f a businessman wants to do business in the\nstate and he's got an issue with the-the law's impacting his personal\nbelief system, he needs to look at being able to compromise. \"358\nAlthough Kennedy admits that such statements could be construed differently,\nhe finds such comments are \"more likely\" hostile toward Phillips. 359 He is\nconvinced of having observed more religious hostility made at a later public\nhearing at the Commission that furthered the animosity toward Phillips's\nreligious views. 360 Kennedy heavy-handedly compounds the Commission's\nprevious statements he excerpted with a Commission member's quote criticizing\nsocietal uses of religion for advancing discriminatory ends throughout human\nhistory-for instance, justifying slavery or the Holocaust.361 That Commission\nmember's quote had ended with a personal tone, which Kennedy expressly\n356.

Kennedy's repeated characterizations of Phillips's religious\nmotivations as \"sincere\" imply that Phillips was being genuine and truthful about\nhis religious beliefs.365 It also suggests that Phillips's actions against Craig and\nMullins were somehow blameless-that his refusal was somehow naturally\njustified because they were backed by \"sincere\" religious beliefs against same-\nsex marriages and that Phillips could not help himself from acting inconsistently\nwith his beliefs. As such, Kennedy again views Phillips's religiously motivated\nactions of sexual orientation discrimination with plausible deniability in favor of\nPhillips. Because Phillips's religiously motivated actions are backed by\n\"sincere\" religious beliefs, the Commission's public remarks on record about\nPhillips's exercise of religion-and the lack of objections to these remarks at the\nhearings and in later appellate review 66-would always be taken as hostile,\n362.

And the\nlater state-court ruling reviewing the Commission's decision did not mention those comments, much\nless express concern with their content. Nor were the comments by the commissioners disavowed\nin the briefs filed in this Court. For these reasons, the Court cannot avoid the conclusion that these\nstatements cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission's adjudication of Phillips'\ncase. Members of the Court have disagreed on the question whether statements made by lawmakers\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\ninappropriate, and disparaging to Phillips's personal character. In this way, he\nmoralizes and nearly essentializes Phillips's religious identity. He dignifies\nPhillips. This reasoning pantomimes the kind of dignity rhetoric he had used in\nLawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell to show respectively how anti-sodomy laws,\nDOMA, and exclusion from marriage all demeaned the identities of same-sex\ncouples.367 He ushers in such indication because the type of religious freedom\nPhillips subscribes to, after all, is within the dominant status quo. The dignity in\nPhillips's religious identity unquestionably exists and so it must be that his\nbeliefs are \"sincere.\"\nThis sense that Kennedy is not merely defending Phillips's religious views,\nbut also Phillips's dignity is furthered by his comparisons between the\nCommission's prior decisions in three other Colorado cases where bakers had\nrefused customers who had requested cakes that would have conveyed\nderogatory and hateful messages about same-sex marriages.368 Those bakers had\nwon their cases and lawfully legitimized their refusals before the Commission\non the basis of conscience. 369 Comparing those cake cases to the present one\nbefore the Court, Kennedy finds that \"the Commission's consideration of\nPhillips' religious objection did not accord with its treatment of these other\nobjections., 370 To perpetuate another example that the Commission had shown\nreligious hostility toward Phillips, Kennedy sides with Phillips's view that \"this\ndisparity in treatment reflected hostility on the part of the Commission toward\nhis beliefs. 37 1 In doing so, Kennedy implies that the Commission had treated\nthe conscience-based objections in the other cake cases as legitimate because the\nCommission had equated designing a custom cake with derogatory messages as\nmay properly be taken into account in determining whether a law intentionally discriminates on the\nbasis of religion.\").\n367.

In essence, by making that\ncake for Craig and Mullins, he would be endorsing something that he did not\nbelieve in-so much so that he could not even go along with it without it\nbecoming personal. Again, therein lies the hostility, according to Kennedy.3 73\nOne could argue that Kennedy does not merely defend Phillips's sincerely held\nreligious beliefs here but also defends Phillips's religious identity.\n5. Speciousness and Questions of Motives\nKennedy's religious hostility findings in the Commission's treatment of\nPhillips's case become specious and thin when his version of religious hostility\ncompetes with the versions expounded in his colleagues' concurrences and\ndissents. Whether the other Justices found lesser, deeper, or no violations of\nreligious neutrality, disagreement exists over both the Commission's remarks\ntoward Phillips's religiously motivated refusal and the handling of the William\nJack cake cases on below. Such disagreement calls into question the substance\nof Kennedy's findings of religious hostility and illustrates the desperate attempt\nto preserve the status quo.\nAlthough in agreement with the majority's overall ruling in Masterpiece that\nreligious hostility existed in lower proceedings, Justice Kagan, with Justice\nBreyer joining, offers a lesser degree of religious hostility in her concurrence.\nShe suggests that the Commission and the appellate court's regard for the\ndifferent results between the Masterpiece case here and the three other Colorado\ncake cases was legally justified and not a sign of religious hostility.3 74 In her\nview, the different regard between those cake refusals and Phillips's hinged on\nfactual interpretation: \"[I]n refusing that request, the bakers did not single out\nJack because of his religion, but instead treated him the same way they would\nhave treated anyone else-just as CADA requires. By contrast, the same-sex\ncouple in this case requested a wedding cake that Phillips would have made for\n372. Id. at 1730-31.\n373. Id. at 1731.\n374. Id. at 1733-34 (Kagan & Breyer, JJ., concurring).\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nan opposite-sex couple.\" 31 Such refusal violated CADA's public\naccommodations protections against sexual orientation discrimination.37 6 In that\nway, \"[t]he different outcomes in the Jack cases and the Phillips case could thus\nhave been justified by a plain reading and neutral application of Colorado law-\nuntainted by any bias against a religious belief., 377 Kagan only agrees with\nKennedy's majority that the views and sentiments of the Commission members\nat the public hearings were religiously hostile, and thus, her version of religious\nhostility-though it exists sufficiently in this case for her to join in the Court's\nreversal-seems less severe.\nJustice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Alito, concurs by re-examining on his\nown terms the Commission's treatment of the other Colorado bakers' refusals in\nthose three cake cases and Phillips's case. Gorsuch disagrees with Kagan's\ninterpretation of the cakes. While Kagan had accepted that the cake that Craig\nand Mullins had requested from Phillips was a wedding cake, 378 Gorsuch\ninterprets that what Craig and Mullins had asked for was \"a cake celebrating a\nsame-sex wedding.\"379 This interpretation allows Gorsuch to read the William\nJack cake cases and Masterpiece similarly and question the Commission's and\nappellate court's distinguishing of those cases from Phillips's. If the bakers were\nlegally allowed to refuse Mr. Jack's requests for cakes that denigrated same-sex\nweddings because the messages were morally offensive to the bakers, then\nPhillips should have been able to refuse Craig and Mullins's request for a cake\ncelebrating a same-sex wedding because same-sex marriages were religiously\nrepugnant to Phillips.380 As Gorsuch sees it, \"[i]n both cases, it was the kind of\ncake, not the kind of customer, that mattered to the bakers ' 381 and that \"[t]he\nproblem here is that the Commission failed to act neutrally by applying a\nconsistent legal rule.\"382 Gorsuch's concurrence heightens that disparity with a\ndeeper analysis than Kennedy's opinion. But to see the cake as one that\nparticularly celebrates a same-sex wedding or marriage is problematic and\nresembles the \"special rights\" rhetoric that conservative opponents had lodged\nagainst gay rights movement initiatives in the past.383 In this way, Gorsuch's\ndeeper analysis engenders more animosity toward the couple than Kennedy's.\n375.

Unlike Gorsuch or Kagan, his\nconcurrence focused exclusively on the free speech claim that Kennedy had left\nunexplored in the majority opinion. 384 Because Phillips refused Craig and\nMullins on the grounds that he was religiously opposed to same-sex marriage,\nhis act of refusal, which Thomas analyzes as speech, is invariably entwined with\nreligion. First, Thomas finds that for Phillips the design and creation of custom\nwedding cakes is expressive enough to qualify as speech.385 In addition, Thomas\nfinds that wedding cakes themselves are highly symbolic, which further\nheightens the expressiveness of creating them. 3 86 Thus, the act of creating\nwedding cakes for Phillips is an expressive one for speech protection.387 As such,\nThomas regards Craig and Mullins's request as one that asked Phillips to create\na cake for a same-sex wedding and sought endorsement with the couple's\nspeech-not his.388 Essentially, \"[b]y forcing Phillips to create custom wedding\ncakes for same-sex weddings, Colorado's public-accommodations law 'alter[s]\nthe expressive content' of his message.\" 389 Thomas's rationale here amplifies\nPhillips's personal endorsement when he creates a wedding cake---\"Colorado is\nrequiring Phillips to be 'intimately connected' with the couple's speech\"-and\nthus his First Amendment speech protections arise.39 ° Such speech would be\nantithetical to Phillips's religious identity, and Thomas demonstrates this by\ndrawing out Phillips's religious nature. 39 1 To add this free speech violation to\nequal access and treatment within the law, and thus states ought to include sexual minorities in\nantidiscrimination laws, protect sexual minorities from hate crimes, and provide legal recognition\nof same-sex relationships.

In contrast, opponents will often reframe what proponents\nof equal rights for sexual minorities as asking for as \"special rights\" that \"tap into fundamental\ncultural values concerning individualism and prejudicial views of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transfer\npeople\" and find that the legal changes in which pro-LGBTQ proponents are seeking are \"for more\nrights than the average American receives.\" Id. at 836. In Gorsuch's concurrence here, one could\nfind the analogy to special rights rhetoric if one views the cake as a cake \"for a same-sex wedding,\"\nrather than as a wedding cake--especially if that view is juxtaposed with the fact that at the time\nCraig and Mullins tried to order their cake, Colorado did not recognize same-sex couples in\nmarriage. Under this problematic logic, the couple would seem to be asking for something more\nthan what they could get.\n384. Masterpiece, 138 S.

In Ginsburg's opinion, she argues against Gorsuch's\nview that the case is about the kind of cake and not the identity of the parties.\nRather, \"[w]hat matters is that Phillips would not provide a good or service to a\nsame-sex couple that he would provide to a heterosexual couple.\"396 This reading\nreveals her perspective that the cake was a wedding cake and not a cake with a\npro-marriage-equality message: \"When a couple contacts a bakery for a wedding\ncake, the product they are seeking is a cake celebrating their wedding-not a\ncake celebrating heterosexual weddings or same-sex weddings-and that is the\nservice Craig and Mullins were denied. 39 7 The reason for that denial, as\nGinsburg surmises, is Craig and Mullins's sexual orientation.\n398\nGinsburg also firmly contradicts Kennedy's other reason for finding\nreligious hostility, which regarded certain Commission members' remarks as\nintolerant of Phillips's religious views. Just as the treatment of the other\nColorado cake cases with Phillips's refusal should not have prompted a reversal\nbased on religious hostility, \"nor do the comments by one or two members of\none of the four decisionmaking entities considering this case justify reversing the\njudgment below.\" 399 In Ginsburg's perspective, \"[w]hatever one may think of\nthe statements in historical context, I see no reason why the comments of one or\ntwo Commissioners should be taken to overcome Phillips' refusal to sell a\n392.

Hialeah,4 °3 \"implicated a sole\ndecisionmaking body\" and not the kind of proceedings on below in\nMasterpiece.40 4 Had she penned the majority ruling, she would have rendered a\ncompletely opposite opinion.\nTaken altogether, the differences amongst Masterpiece's majority,\nconcurring, and dissenting opinions over the existence, intensity, and\nnonexistence of religious hostility against Phillips seem to suggest that the\nreligious hostility issue was a tenuous one to consider. Did religious hostility\nexist in both the Commission members' remarks against Phillips's religious\nviews and how the Commission distinguished Phillips's refusal in Masterpiece\nfrom the bakers' refusals in the William Jack cases, as Kennedy argues in the\nmajority? Or did religious hostility only exist in the remarks and not in the way\nKennedy or Gorsuch read the Commission's distinguishing of the other cake\ncases, as Kagan writes in her concurrence? Did it arise within the free speech\nviolation as well, as Thomas seems to suggest? Was the religious hostility more\nintense and more pernicious than Kennedy's majority suggest, as Gorsuch tries\nto demonstrate in his reconciliation of the William Jack cake cases and\nMasterpiece? Or did neither the remarks nor the Commission's distinguishing of\nthe William Jack cake cases from Masterpiece amount to any religious hostility\nin the lower proceedings, as Ginsburg tries to assert? There is no consensus here,\nrevealing that the Court's review of general applicability in Masterpiece is\npotentially plausible but could also be misleading. Because of the way in which\ndiffering viewpoints of the concurrences and dissents would recalibrate or\ndisagree with Kennedy's religious hostility finding, the Court's review of general\napplicability could be specious. Of course, when members of the Court disagree,\nthe specter of speciousness is not always warranted. But in Masterpiece, this\nnon-consensus does suggest the possibility that the Court majority's rendering\nwas not quite accurate. Instead it was Kennedy's best argument to make in light\nof stronger, more definite facts that sexual orientation discrimination did occur\nunder CADA when Phillips refused to fulfill Craig and Mullins's request. And\n400. Id. at 1751.\n401. Id.\n402. Id. (\"What prejudice infected the determinations of the adjudicators in the case before and after the\nCommission?

Ct. at 1751-52.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nthat best argument--religious hostility that violates general applicability-is a\ncontentious and debatable one, at best. That emphatic urgency in Masterpiece to\nstick with such a questionable argument as the crux to overturning the prior state\ncourt ruling of sexual orientation discrimination possibly reveals a tension-\neven with some of the non-conservative justices-for finding sexual orientation\nas a trait worthy of fuller protections, even after Obergefell. Or it could\nexemplify the Justices' tension with the kind of sexual minority litigants this time\nbefore the Court. In essence, the Court seems to articulate a higher interest in\npreserving a discriminatory status quo over affirming an instance of sexual\norientation antidiscrimination. Sexual orientation as a protectable trait against\ndiscrimination reached some progress in Obergefell but has never achieved the\nkind of heightened scrutiny protections that race and gender have received. And\nthat limited progress is definitely underscored by the interests the Court\nanxiously engenders around religious freedom in this sexual orientation\ndiscrimination case.\nThe instability of the religious hostility argument amongst Justices of the\nMasterpiece Court, hence, raises questions of motives. The case's resolution\nthrough Kennedy's majority opinion depends on the Justices' review of the\nprocedural aspects of the lower proceedings in order to dispense with the task of\ndetermining the couple's sexual orientation discrimination claim under CADA.\nThat strategic reliance on procedure forecloses any substantive review between\nCraig and Mullins's antidiscrimination interests and Phillips's religious freedom\ninterests-a substantive review that could have sided in favor of the couple as\nthe Commission and the Court of Appeals exhibited strong findings of\ndiscrimination in their CADA reviews. Not to mention, the Court's review of the\nprocedures on below is directly related to Phillips's religion--directly attached\nto interests in preserving a discriminatory status quo though affirming religious\nfreedom. Consequently, the Court highlights the interests of status-quo\npreservation over protecting sexual minorities-here, sexual minorities who\nshowed little resemblance to the assimilated, respectable sexual minorities in\nObergefell. Of course, it will be unknown, given the way the Court handled its\ndecision in Masterpiece, whether Craig and Mullins would have prevailed here\nhad they exhibited more of the same traits that the plaintiffs from the marriage-\nequality cases had exhibited. However, in terms of sexual orientation, one view\nremains evident from Masterpiece. When confronted with religion--even in the\ncontext of marriage--queer sexual identities, rather than assimilated ones,\nengender much less deference with the Court. In Masterpiece, the Court's\nconception of sexual orientation antidiscrimination very likely does not include\nprotection of less assimilated, less mainstream sexual minorities.\nIndeed, the primacy that Kennedy gives to protecting Phillips's exercise of\nreligion is so paramount that it makes deference to religion seem circuitous and\ndifficult to critique. After all, acts of discrimination often stem from some form\n[Vol. 31.2:249316\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nof harbored animus.4 05 In pinpointing discrimination, drawing such motives help\nestablish that an act of discrimination occurred. However, because Kennedy\nfinds that even the Commission's remark about the historical use of religion for\nadvancing discrimination is one that had tarnished Phillips's religious identity\nrather than having served constructively to demonstrate religiously motivated\ndiscrimination, future adjudicating bodies must tread carefully when their fair\nand neutral application of laws is prompted in religion cases. Such perspective\non the Court's finding of religious hostility has scholarly support. According to\nLeslie Kendrick and Micah Swartzman,\n[i]n Masterpiece, the Court mistook the neutral application of civil\nrights law for what Justice Scalia once called a \"fit of spite.\" The\nCommission's decision to deny Phillips a religious exemption was not\nthe product of religious hostility, but rather a good faith effort to\ninterpret and apply CADA, which forbids discrimination on the basis of\nsexual orientation in public accommodations. In holding that the\nCommission failed to treat Phillips's claims with neutrality and respect,\nthe Court improperly applied free exercise doctrine to the facts of the\ncase, finding unconstitutional hostility and intolerance where there were\nnone.\n406\nCorrespondingly, the effect of Masterpiece, in regard to future application of\nneutrality, seems unclear according to John Inazu: \"The [Masterpiece Court's]\njurisprudence means that we're going to have state-by-state norms that vary quite\na bit . . about what counts as protections for religious freedom. 4 °7 These\ncomments and the different versions (or in Ginsburg's case, non-version) of\nreligious hostility renders Kennedy's finding and use of religious hostility in the\nmajority opinion shaky. Indirectly, it could exhibit the Court's hasty anxiety to\nprioritize the interest in protecting religious freedom within a discriminatory\nstatus quo over the interest in promoting sexual orientation antidiscrimination. It\nserves as another possible sign of failure to satisfy the requisite interest\nconvergence needed for Craig and Mullins's success.\nAll of this demonstrates the heightened interest the Court has in preserving\na discriminatory status quo in Masterpiece as a reaction to the threats Craig and\nMullins represented. Not only does Kennedy prioritize the interest in protecting\nreligious freedom over the interest in protecting against sexual orientation\ndiscrimination, but he also demonstrates how paramount the former interest is-\nin fact, he reinforces it-when he reverses the sexual orientation discrimination\n405.

But in\nreaching that towering height, Kennedy and the concurring Justices seem to have\noffered an unsatisfying fimding of religious hostility. It belies a deep, pernicious\nsense of queer anxiety against Craig and Mullins fueled by a perception that the\nstatus quo was being threatened.\nC. Queer Sacrifice\nSpeciousness and anxiety in the Court's religious hostility finding leaves a\nfrustrating regard for Kennedy's opinion. Can such dubious reasoning undo what\nhad been a strong showing of sexual orientation discrimination under CADA?\nCraig and Mullins were refused service and goods because of their sexual\norientation. Phillips was not exempt under CADA's religious exception.\nNevertheless, looking at the case through Derrick Bell's interest-convergence\ntheory, the ruling makes more sense because, although the law stands thinly, the\nmotives are clear. Under the Court's perception, Craig and Mullins likely\nthreatened the status quo.\nBut if the only conclusion drawn from observing the lack of interest\nconvergence in Masterpiece is that dominant authorities-i.e., the Supreme\nCourt-are reluctant to protect unassimilated sexual minorities, then merely\nnoticing the absence of converging interests would be a limiting feat. The utility\nof seeing Bell's interest-convergence theory demonstrated in the context of gay\nrights would be constrained as well-and, like the Court's majority decision,\nonly half-baked. What Masterpiece actually demonstrates is not merely that\nBell's interest-convergence thesis exists in gay movement progression, but also\nwhat Kreis had identified when he applied Bell's interest-convergence thesis as\na predictive model for future gay rights advancements. Kreis had reiterated\nBell's thesis of involuntary sacrifice in the sexual minority context-a theory\nBell called \"racial sacrifice\" that compliments interest-convergence thesis to\nform what Bell referred to as \"racial fortuity. ' ' 409 In writing several years before\nObergefell and Masterpiece, Kreis was right to import Bell's racial sacrifice\nthesis into the progress of LGBTQ movements then because Masterpiece's\nmisalignment of interests here-its lack of interest convergence-is an example\n408.

Indeed, Masterpiece is an instance of queer\nsacrifice.\n1. Bell's Theory\nFor Bell, interest convergence helped clarify why the Court in Brown v.\nBoard of Education had the opportunity to overturn its previous segregation\nholding in Plessy v. Ferguson.410 The theory offered a predictive mechanism for\nexploring when dominant powers might accommodate marginalized groups. Yet,\ninterest convergence is merely one piece of Bell's later theory of racial fortuity.\nIn the context of that racial fortuity theory, interest convergence is merely one\nvariable that is complimented by another theory: racial sacrifice. Within the\nstruggles to overcome racial inequality, Bell defined racial sacrifice as the way\nin which \"society is always willing to sacrifice the rights of black people in order\nto protect important economic or political interests of whites.\" ' 4 1  Bell later\nreiterated racial sacrifice as a predictive moniker-in the inverse logic of interest\nconvergence-to anticipate when the white dominant power will decide not to\nwield their authority for legal and political change that would help advance\ninterests of marginalized racial groups, such as African-Americans: \"Even when\ninterest-convergence results in an effective racial remedy, that remedy will be\nabrogated at the point that policymakers fear the remedial policy is threatening\nthe superior societal status of whites, particularly those in the middle and upper\nclasses., 41 2 Both interest convergence and racial sacrifice are \"two sides of the\nsame coin. The two-sided coin, with involuntary racial sacrifice on the one side\nand interest-convergent remedies on the other, can be referred to as racial\nfortuity. 413 Consequently, Bell conceptualizes the underpinnings of racial\nprogress through \"racial fortuity,\" which are animated by instances of interest\nconvergence and racial sacrifice.414 And if one views racial fortuity as the way\nAmerican society has achieved racial justice, then one would assume very\npessimistically that racial justice occurs not through \"hard-earned entitlement\"\nbut is \"pre-ordained\" through this mechanism of racial fortuity plotted by\nconverging interests and racial sacrifice, altemating side-by-side. 415\n410. 163 U.S. 537 (1896).\n411.

BELL, supra note 409, at 9.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nBell noticed examples of involuntary racial sacrifice in several American\nhistorical moments. For example, he saw racial sacrifice during the original\ndrafting of the Constitution when slavery was protected to bolster slave-owner\nsupport for the document.4 16 Bell also considered the Compromise of 1877,\nwhich staved off resurgence of the Civil War, as racial sacrifice at the expense\nof the rights of southern blacks.41 7 As a third example, he saw racial sacrifice in\nthe way that the Court in Plessy constitutionally permitted segregation as a way\nto engender white support for existing economic policies that were not favoring\nwhite people.\n418\nWithin the school desegregation era after Brown, Bell adopted the view that\nwhite resistance to desegregation lingered long after the landmark decision,\nwhich affected implementation of desegregation, but that decision itself had left\nroom for white resistance through its subtle deference to Southern whites.\n4 19\nKathleen Bergin, in her study of Bell's racial fortuity theory, concentrates on this\nobservation as a way that Brown eventually led to racial sacrifice, arguing that\n[t]he seeds of racial sacrifice were planted even prior to the\nannouncement of Brown, when a number of Justices voiced concern\nduring the Court's judicial conferences for the impact desegregation\nwould have on Whites. No matter how irrational \"prosegregation\nemotion,\" Justice Jackson wrote, \"we can hardly deny the existence of\nsincerity and passion of those who think that their blood, birth and\nlineage are something worthy of protection by separatism.\" Justice Reed\nwas even more solicitous, urging the Court to \"start with the idea that\nthere is a large and reasonable body of opinion in various states that\nseparation of the races is for the benefit of both.\" The record suggests\nthat several Justices agreed to strike down segregation on the condition\nthat Chief Justice Warren draft an opinion that did not require immediate\nimplementation from the South.420\nThe passages of the Justices Robert Jackson and Stanley Reed by the Brown\nCourt bear sharp resemblance to the deference that Kennedy gave in Obergefell\nto those who opposed same-sex marriages, whom he characterized as acting \"in\ngood faith\" in their religious belief and \"reasonable and sincere.\"' 42 1 In\n416.

Between\nBell and Bergin, these post-Brown observations of racial sacrifice resemble the\nhomophobic reactions after Obergefell and eventually the ruling in Masterpiece.\n2. Queering Bell's Theory in Masterpiece\nIf one can conclude that interest convergence did occur in Obergefell and in\nother gay rights decisions 428-then it is also possible to apply the rest of Bell's\nthesis toward interpreting the mechanism of advancements in justice for sexual\nminorities. If Obergefell signified interest convergence, then Masterpiece, with\nits lack of converging interests, could stand as an example of the kind of\ninvoluntary sacrifice akin to what Bell and Bergin pegged as racial sacrifice post-\nBrown-only here perhaps what the Court's decision represents is a moment of\n''queer sacrifice.\"\nTo reiterate the definition of racial sacrifice, Bell states that \"[e]ven when\ninterest-convergence results in an effective racial remedy, that remedy will be\nabrogated at the point that policymakers fear the remedial policy is threatening\nthe superior societal status of whites, particularly those in the middle and upper\nclasses. '429 Bell's theory is applicable to Masterpiece. At the start of the case,\nthe effective remedy available to sexual minorities against sexual orientation\ndiscrimination was Colorado's public accommodations law.4 30 As Kennedy\nnotes in Masterpiece, CADA's protection of sexual minorities against\ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation was an addition made in 2007\nand 2008.431 Prior to this amendment, sexual orientation had lacked CADA\nprotection. The Colorado state legislature's addition of sexual orientation as a\nprotected class within its state antidiscrimination law could have been an\ninstance of interest convergence that resulted in a remedy for protecting sexual\nminorities.432 This possible instance of interest convergence could have been\n427.

A source that narrates the legislative history of CADA's amendment inclusion of \"sexual\norientation\" in 2008 suggests purposes and reasons beyond merely protecting the civil rights of\nsexual minorities for the specific inclusion of \"sexual orientation\" as a category of protection. At\nthe forefront of the legislative debate was a concern that not adding \"sexual orientation\" continued\nthe perception that Colorado was not a friendly state to sexual minorities. Brief of Colo. Orgs. &\nIndividuals in Supp. of Respondents 11-14, Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. Civil Rights\nComm'n, 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018) (No. 16-111). In addition, the legislative negotiations that led up\nto the 2008 amendment appeared very mindful of accommodating religious interests while\n[Vol. 31.2:249322\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nfacilitated also by the Court's decision in Romer v. Evans in 1996, striking down\nColorado's Amendment 2, which specifically denied protections for sexual\norientation discrimination.433 In addition, since Masterpiece was following the\nCourt's marriage equality decision in Obergefell, an interpretation could also be\nmade that interest convergence could have contributed to another effective\nremedy for sexual minorities here, even though the facts of Masterpiece predated\nthe Obergefell decision. The references to Obergefell in the respondents' briefs\ncould reasonably allow such an inference; Craig and Mullins were trying to use\nObergefell to leverage the outcome of their case.434 Thus, the Court's own\ninterest convergence in Romer and Obergefell likely influenced the available\nrelief at this judicial level of review. In other words, the couple had CADA on\ntheir side--especially after the lower proceedings.\nFrom here, it is possible to read into Masterpiece the effect that Craig and\nMullins' less assimilated, less respectable sexual identities had toward producing\nthe Court's reversal of their successful CADA discrimination claim against the\nreligious baker, Phillips. Borrowing Bell's description of racial fortuity,\nconditions that had been fortuitous for marriage equality and same-sex couples\nin the Obergefell case were now changed in Masterpiece.435 As discussed above,\nthe Masterpiece couple did not embody the assimilated and respectable traits of\nthe Obergefell plaintiffs and they did not share perceived mainstream American\ncharacteristics or demographics, nor did they seem similar to the justices\nthemselves. Instead, their queer identities made them more like outsiders to the\nAmerican mainstream or elite, as well as to assimilated and respectable gay\npopulations. Instead of fitting in with perceived heteronormative ideals of family\nand gender roles, Craig and Mullins played with androgyny and repeatedly\ndisplayed their sexuality in public for the media to harness. They did not have\nfamily-oriented obligations such as caretaking of children or relatives. When\nthey ought to have been more politically quiet, they did not relent. They did not\npresent themselves as having sufficiently respectable jobs or careers. Outside of\ntraditional dominant ideas about gender, family, and respectability, they\nappeared threatening to the heteronormative status quo in ways that the\nObergefell plaintiffs had not. Their perceived nonconformity cost them more\nthan just cake.\nMoreover, their discrimination claim involved religious beliefs that\nreaffirmed the dominant, heteronormative status quo-specifically Christian\nprotecting sexual minorities. Id. at 13-14. These additional reasons suggest that the addition of\n\"sexual orientation\" was not a categorical decision to protect sexual minorities but a compromise\nbetween various converging interests.\n433. 517 U.S. 620, 635-36 (1996).\n434.

BELL, supra note 409, at 9.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nbeliefs against same-sex marriages held by a deeply religious merchant. In\nfollowing Bell's theory of racial sacrifice, it might be possible for queer sacrifice\nto take place when the facts present a sexual orientation discrimination suit filed\nby a same-sex couple whose destabilizing sexual identities threaten the status\nquo more than other assimilated and respectable same-sex couples would.\nHowever, what could seem even more threatening to the Court was how that\nsexual orientation discrimination suit by this nonconforming queer couple\ndirectly confronted religion through a moment of Christian antipathy toward\nsame-sex marriages. This direct confrontation with religion offered the tipping\npoint to which the Court responded by reversing the appellate court decision\nfavoring the couple, not by finding fault with the CADA claim itself but through\na questionable finding of religious hostility in the lower proceedings. It could be\nthat the Court's protection of religion--reflecting its interest in protecting the\nheteronormative status quo-was provoked by anxiety over having to protect\nqueerness under CADA, even if marriage equality legally existed. The reversal\nin Masterpiece was likely an abrogation of effective remedies under CADA\nbecause otherwise the use of remedies under CADA would somehow threaten\nthe dominant group. It would have led to an acknowledgement of queerness.\nAccordingly, Masterpiece extends Bell's racial sacrifice theory-but as an\ninstance of queer sacrifice. If interest convergence has already been observed in\nother moments within the LGBTQ movement, then one could plausibly read\ninstances in which sexual minorities did not prevail, such as Masterpiece, as\nmoments of queer sacrifice within a similar-perhaps, identical-mechanism of\nsexual minority justice akin to Bell's theory of racial fortuity. Here, we have\n\"queer fortuity\" instead of racial fortuity. Precisely in this comparison, examples\nof interest convergence and queer sacrifice could also animate advances for\nsexual minorities consonant with how Bell's thesis offers specific strategies\nagainst mechanisms of subordination and injustice in the racial justice context.\nAs much as Part II has shown that Bell's thesis has been appropriate for\nexplaining Masterpiece, it also serves to guide us forward. Part III will explore\nsuch possibilities.\nHI. FORTUITY BEYOND MARRIAGE\nAt first glance, the Masterpiece decision ought to engender various levels of\npessimism for sexual minorities in the post-marriage-equality era. From Part i's\ndiscussion, the decision reveals significant limits with the level of formal legal\nequality that assimilated same-sex couples had received in Obergefell.\nMasterpiece illustrates the constraints of both marriage rights and sameness\narguments, and exhibits the lengths to which the Court will go to preserve a\ndiscriminatory status quo in the face of protecting sexual minorities who appear\nless mainstream. This was the result even when Craig and Mullins had an\n[Vol. 31.2:249\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\neffective and probable legal remedy under CADA. Commentators have drawn\nmultiple conclusions about the case depending on each commentator's level of\npessimism. Some regard the decision as narrow; others disagree. 436 But by\napplying Bell's theory, this Article has argued that Masterpiece is a setback for\nthe gay movement-a movement that has, in considerable parts, shifted away\nfrom employing grassroots liberationist tactics pinned on transforming existing\nhegemony to more assimilative strategies rooted in identity politics and single-\nissue causes that are often more salient to what matters to the elite-tier\ndemographic of the sexual minority population.\nA. Changed Conditions\nAs the Court's reversal of Craig and Mullins's CADA discrimination claim\nhas perhaps shown, so long as the kind of sexual minorities seeking remedial\nprotection under antidiscrimination laws seem to pose a threat to the status quo,\nthe interest in protecting them is less likely to align with dominant interests than\nwhen the litigants seemed more assimilated and respectable. As a result, the\nstatus quo will be preserved if a solution to do so exists. In Masterpiece, that\nsolution involved prioritizing an already-existing aspect of the dominant status\nquo: anti-gay religious belief. As an instance of queer sacrifice, the Court used\nreligious freedom to undo the substance of Craig and Mullins's public\naccommodations claim of sexual orientation discrimination, while affirming\nPhillips's right to refuse because of his religious beliefs.\nMasterpiece's legal contours, of course, beg the question of how sexual\norientation antidiscrimination claims at the Court might succeed in the future. A\nfew weeks after releasing the decision, Justice Kennedy, the swing vote and\nauthor of previous gay rights decisions, as well as the author of Masterpiece's\nmajority opinion here, retired from the Court's membership. 411 With his\nretirement, the new composition of the Court tips ever more socially and\npolitically conservative, thus becoming a more challenging forum for sexual\nminorities.4 38 Even if antidiscrimination legislation that protects sexual identity\n436.

As Boso observes,\n[g]ender is relational and culturally informed, and no two individuals will express\nmasculinity or femininity in precisely the same ways. Nor will two individuals\npossess identical ideas about how others should perform their gender (to the extent\nthat one is concerned about policing others' gender conformity). This reality\npotentially confounds sex stereotyping analysis: what does it mean to conform to\nmale or female sex stereotypes when there is no uniform masculinity or femininity to\nwhich one must conform? The answer lies in identifying and understanding the\ndominant, emblematic versions of gender in any given social context. These\ndominant versions of masculinity or femininity serve as the tool for evaluating men\nand women in a particular setting.\nId. (footnote omitted). Under this logic, Boso further prescribes that\n[iun male sex stereotyping cases, then, it matters little whether a plaintiff deviates\nfrom masculine norms in ways that the presiding judge would characterize as\nfeminine, or even whether a plaintiff thinks of himself as masculine or feminine. For\na boy or an adult man, simply being different from the most dominant form of\nmasculinity in a schoolroom, workplace, or small town can mark him as not a real\nman. Differences can render seemingly sex-neutral traits and behaviors proxies for\nfemininity, and it is reasonable to infer that people who treat boys and men\ndisparately based on these differences are discriminating on the basis of sex. Plaintiffs\nare entitled to make this showing in court, and they should not have their claims\nthrown out by judges who are unwilling to think critically about gender.\nId. at 149.\n326\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nchallenge based on sex-stereotyping again could provoke or threaten the\nestablishment-minded.\nWhether the Zarda and Bostock litigants have captured enough interest\nconvergence to prevail at the Court remains to be seen at the time of this writing.\nConditions have changed since Obergefell. The Court is now a less gracious and\npromising an avenue for sexual minorities than when it decided the marriage\ncases. But the problem of strategy for true equality should not have been\nexclusively hinged on the legal forum.4 44 Assimilationist strategies based on\nchanging organizational practices in the gay movement that survived since AIDS\nepidemic campaigns have professionalized the face of gay rights lobbying and\npolitical organization.445 Some of the blame for the limitations in Masterpiece\nlies also within the narrower, single-issue approaches-such as marriage\nequality-that funneled gay rights into identity politics and a politics of\nrespectability. Unfortunately, respectability politics played into the dominance\nand power of the mainstream culture, rather than gaining equal footing with the\nmainstream. Perhaps engaging with a politics of respect for all types of sexual\nidentities, instead, would have avoided a more accommodating position against\nthe mainstream.\nEven worse, if Bell was correct in interpreting his own racial fortuity theory,\nthen his observation stands that racial progress and likely advancements for other\nmarginalized groups are \"pre-ordained\" by the back-and-forth process of interest\nconvergence and involuntary sacrifice at the hands of the dominant power rather\nthan solidifying as \"hard-earned entitlement[s].' 4 6 Placing this notion within the\ncontext of sexual orientation antidiscrimination, Bell's remark here about the\nillusion of hard-earned entitlements in successes driven by interest convergence\nwould even pierce or debunk the respectability politics that the Obergefell\nplaintiffs courted during that litigation in order to obtain marriage equality. One\nprevious strand of conceptualizing Obergefell has focused on how same-sex\ncouples there had earned their entitlement to marriage through their appearances\nof respectability-by how much their sameness dignified themselves enough for\nthe Court to extend to them fundamental rights to marry, rather than by their\nshowing of any intrinsic human worth or dignity. However, if applying racial\nfortuity to explain gay rights advancements, then Bell would perhaps offer an\neven more cynical view than respectability politics. His theory would deny\nObergefell's success as any hard-earned entitlement. Rather, his theory of\nfortuity grafted here would conclude that equality for sexual minorities in\n444. See BELL, supra note 409, at 185-86 (discussing over-reliance on the court system in racial equality).\n445.

REv. 503, 535 (2018) (describing how queer activism that came about\nduring the AIDs crisis \"was short-lived\" and that \"most of these groups disbanded by the mid- 1990s,\nleaving only professionalized rights organizations that pursued assimilationist strategies\").\n446. BELL, supra note 409, at 9.\n2020]\nYale Journal of Law and Feminism\nObergefell was driven by conditions beyond the control of sexual minority\nlitigants themselves and that \"[i]ts departure, when conditions change, [was]\npreordained, '\" 4 7 as it is in Masterpiece. In this view, Obergefell's success was,\nindeed, pre-ordained by changing conditions that provided sufficient interest\nconvergence; it was not necessarily earned through a mere showing of\nrespectability. Other considerations were at play.\nB. Masterpiece's Missed Fortuity\nEven if Bell's racial fortuity theory could be extended to comprehend the\nlegal and political advancements for sexual minorities, this thesis ought not to\nstifle the movement, nor the aspirations for true equality. Indeed, to combat the\ndilemma of racial fortuity, Bell responded with a strategy he called \"forged\nfortuity.\" 448 Drawing on the view here that Masterpiece represents queer\nsacrifice and that the movement for advancing true'equality for sexual minorities\ncould be similarly understood within Bell's racial fortuity thesis-albeit, \"queer\nfortuity\" here-sexual minorities might benefit from Bell's call to persist with\nforged fortuity, which he described as focusing less on the judiciary for results\nand \"more on tactics, actions, and even attitudes that challenge the continuing\nassumptions of white dominance.\" 449 In particular, Bell had insisted that\nAfrican-Americans \"initiate and support actions that seemingly fly in the face of\ninterest-convergence principles when those actions make life more bearable for\nblacks in a society where blacks are a permanent, subordinate class.\"45 In such\na way, \"[r]ecognition of our true state will serve as a gateway to an era where we\nforge fortuity, that is defy the workings of the involuntary sacrifices and interest-\nconvergence determinants of racial policies and practices.',451 Bell's examples of\nforged fortuity included the lunch counter sit-in protests by African-Americans\nthat allowed them to \"overcome traditional laws of trespass and breach of the\npeace\" and prompted leaders of such protests \"to think and plan within a context\nof 'what is' (the existing problem) rather than simply rely on the abstract concept\nof equality. ',452 For Bell, the crux of these sit-in protests for explaining forged\nfortuity strategies was \"that a great many whites would not maintain\ndiscriminatory policies if the cost was too high.\"453 Likewise, Bell's example of\nthe strategies employed by William Robert Ming, a lawyer defending Dr. Martin\n447.

Id.\n[Vol. 31.2:249\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nLuther King, Jr. in a state income tax fraud claim, also displayed forged fortuity\ntactics that \"articulate[d] racially realistic positions that touch[ed] some whites\nin the pocketbook, [and expected] that their sense of justice [would] follow.\" 45 4\nIn the suit that charged King with evading taxes by not reporting the funds\nretained by his Southern Christian Leadership Conference as his own taxable\nincome, Ming defended Dr. King by boosting the number of businessmen in his\nall-white jury so that he could effectively win the case by convincing them that\nto find against Dr. King, they would be establishing a new precedent that would\npermit Alabama to \"calculate[] your income taxes based on the total monies you\nhave in your checking accounts. 4 55 Thus, Ming changed the conditions and\nforged fortuity by showing how costly it would be for whites to discriminate\nagainst Dr. King. In some ways, one could recapitulate that forged fortuity\nrepresents action by a marginalized group to maximize self-interest in a way that\nharnesses the group's power (rather than playing into the dominant authority) to\ndrive forth common interests between the marginalized and dominant groups for\nproducing meaningful, even transformative, change.\nBy interpreting major gay rights cases, such as Obergefell and Masterpiece,\nthrough an extension of Bell's theories, we receive insight about how such\nsuccesses and defeats gained and suffered by sexual minorities are actually still\npredicated within the status quo, rather than actual victories that transform the\nstatus quo. Thus, in hindsight, perhaps Craig and Mullins might have benefitted\nfrom legal arguments that had a larger focus on forging fortuity, rather than\nrelying predominately on persuasions based within constitutional doctrine. Like\nthe lunch counter sit-ins or William Robert Ming's defense of Dr. King, Craig\nand Mullins might have raised reasons why sustaining discrimination against\nsexual minorities might not be economically viable for those controlling the\nstatus quo. This is not to say that this line of reasoning would have categorically\naltered Masterpiece's course, but perhaps it would have played into the\nneoliberal sensibilities of the Supreme Court Justices without affecting\nrespectability politics. 45 6 Below, the Colorado Court of Appeals had raised the\neconomics issue, by noting that sexual orientation discrimination in public places\nincurs \"measurable adverse economic effects. 45 7 The Court of Appeals had\nreferenced a Michigan study that discussed how discriminatory business\n454.

Forging Fortuity Through Coalition Building\nFollowing Bell's theory, others, in the context of race, have articulated\nmultiracial coalition building as an important general strategy for forging\nfortuity.463 \"Interest,\" as Sheryll Cashin writes in her study of Bell's thesis, \"is\nthe recognized tactical or strategic advantage that one racial group can gain by\nforming a coalition with another group. 464 In this sense, she remarks that\n\"[t]here is a hopeful upside to Bell's interest-convergence thesis: broad\ncoalitions for progressive social change are theoretically possible when common\ninterests, or a convergence of enlightened self-interest, can be established. 465\nCashin's examples of such coalition building that transcends interest-\nconvergence principles include \"coalitions among Asians, Latinos, and blacks\n[that] tend to be quite strong when formed around issues that all three groups\nbenefit from, such as eliminating poverty or unemployment or\n458.

Given the complexities\nof racial and queer subordinations, some differences in forging fortuities in the\ncontext of race versus sexuality might occur. However, some commentators\nwithin the sexual minority movement have also noted the need for better\ncoalition building that shifts the movement away from the professionalized,\nsingle-issue, identity politics organizing of recent decades. Through coalitions,\nBell's theory might bring the movement back to liberationist roots and view\nchange not just in terms of formal equality but in terms of transforming the\ncurrent world-i.e., that discriminatory status quo. In line with views about\ncoalition building for the sexual minority movement, some prominent LGBTQ\nvoices have posited similarly. Political science scholar Craig Rimmerman notes\nthat \"[a] central goal of radical democratic politics is to build permanent\ncoalitions around political strategies and concrete public policies that cut across\nrace, class, and gender divides, coalitions that will be ready to respond to the\nChristian Right's distortions in all political arenas.\" ' Historian Martin\nDuberman writes that in the advancement of sexual minorities the imperative for\ncoalition building exists. Especially in the post-Obergefell, post-Obama era,\nthere might be a current spirit for \"resistance\" but \"the parts do not cohere, and\nmay never-not without a seismic effort to overcome our penchant for single-\nissue politics that caters solely to our own primary concerns.' t47 6 He urges further\nthat \"we must combine with allies who we don't love but who share with us a\ncommon enemy-the country's oligarchic structure, its patriarchal author, and\nits primitively fundamentalist moral values.\"\n477\nIn the short years before Obergefell, queer activist Urvashi Vaid wrote that\nmainstream gay rights organizations' assimilative approaches have reduced the\nmovement's goals. 478 In part, this result is so because of the narrow vision of\nequality that resonates only with powerful factions of the mainstream gay\nmovement and causes the movement to conceptualize changes within the\nframework of equality that is set ultimately by the dominant status quo.4 79 This\nnotion might add to the reasons for explaining why the Obergefell and\n475.

Id. at 8-20.\n[Vol. 31.2:249\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nMasterpiece cases resulted in the way they did, and how they extend Bell's\ninterest-convergence and sacrifice theses into gay rights, showing that progress\nis always \"pre-ordained\" by the dominant powers at play. Recognition of sexual\nidentity is not the same as allowing sexual minorities the ability to live full\nlives.48° The goal is not just true equality, but human flourishing. Change must\naffect the status quo in a way that transforms current hegemonic ideas about\nsexual minorities and result in a redistribution of justice.481 To that end, Vaid\nwrites:\nWithout a more substantive definition of equality, without a\ncommitment to its extension to all LGBT people, without deeper and\nmore honest appraisals of the limits of the traditions to which LGBT\npeople seek admission, without a willingness to risk gains made for the\nopportunity to create a world that truly affirms the intrinsic moral and\nhuman worth of people's sexual, racial, and gender difference, the\nLGBT politics currently pursued will yield only conditional equality, a\nsimulation of freedom contingent upon \"good behavior.'4 82\nTo displace this continuing phenomenon, she proposes a \"justice-based\nmovement\" as a type of \"re-formed LGBT movement focused upon social\njustice. ' 483 It would be committed to recognizing the different racial and\neconomic demographics of sexual minorities4 84 and expanding a definition of\nequality that is more comprehensive. 485 Such a movement would broaden the\nmissions of major LGBT organizations, make them more inclusive and\ndemocratic in participation and representation, and force restructure of their\ndonor schemes that promote assimilationist strategies.486 To echo Bell about the\nover-reliance on the judiciary,4 87 Vaid suggests\n[s]hifting the arenas where we concentrate-from courts to executive\nand administration agencies, for example-and then also shifting how\nwe consider the goal of our work there, from mere recognition or\nnaming in a regulatory scheme to a consideration of how it does or does\nnot help the lives and life chances of our communities, offers a practical\npath forward.4 88\n480.

' 4 89 Here, Vaid\narrives at her concept of coalition building for sexual minorities. Specifically,\nshe mentions that \"[flor many decades, progressives have talked about the need\nto link up with each other beyond identity, around shared values and goals.\n490\nThus, instead of working in political silos, \"[w]e who have been working for\nLGBT liberation certainly do not see our goal as building a gay silo or living in\none.\" 491 Those moves would be assimilative. Rather \"[w]e see our work instead\nas building common ground., 492 Vaid's conception of coalition building is\nbroad, philosophical, and liberationist, compared to the assimilative methods of\nlobbying by current mainstream gay rights organizations. It also approaches\nCashin, Crowder, and Smith's extensions of Bell's forged fortuity.\nReaching back to Bell's iterations of forged fortuity, like white dominance,\nsexual minorities must presume heterosupremacy at play in everyday life.493\nBecause of that supremacy, queer people are often undermined or\nsubordinated-whether they are getting married, applying for a job, renting an\napartment, or shopping for a cake. Understanding this perspective, sexual\nminorities ought to be subversive and work actively to protect their self-interest\nbut also not eager to sell out just to gain access to the dominant status quo.494\nThrough inter- and intra-interest convergence, coalitions must be formed with\nother marginalized groups; and they must exist and protest collectively in ways\nthat resemble in spirit the lunch counter sit-ins that Bell mentioned-against the\ndominant status quo, increasing the cost of discriminatory beliefs and practices.\nThe larger and more robust the coalitions are, the less it will be in the dominant\ngroup's interest to sustain discrimination. Together with other groups, sexual\nminorities ought to able to create change that is lasting, transformative, and\nindeed liberationist.\nScholarly calls for coalition building echo each other.

See id.\n[Vol. 31.2:249334\nQueer Sacrifice in Masterpiece Cakeshop\nthe racial context, the scholarly observations for coalition building with common\ninterests externalize Bell's forged fortuity. Brought into the sexual minority\ncontext, the call for broad coalition building-particularly one that appears more\ntransformative-echoes the need not only to combat a continuing inequality\nimposed against sexual minorities by those operating within a discriminatory\nstatus quo, but also the need to resolve the intra-group marginalization between\nassimilated, elite gays and lesbians and sexual minorities living outside that sub-\ncategory.495 These overlapping calls and suggestions for coalition building are\nmore liberationist than assimilative. Because such coalition building would\nhopefully seek to challenge the hegemony and not play into it, in that sense, a\nreformed movement that forges its own fortuity by coalescing around values and\nissues beyond identity politics should be broad and should be investigated\nearnestly as the next step forward.4 96 Invariably, it ought to dial up the LGBTQ\nmovement's approaches and tactics a few degrees more liberationist and some\nsignificant degrees more queer.\nCONCLUSION\nSexual minorities still live at the mercy of the dominant status quo. By\nconceptualizing Masterpiece as an example of queer sacrifice and seeing how\nBell's theory of fortuity fits appropriately over the progressive ebb and flow of\nthe sexual minority movement, it is possible to perceive that the movement needs\nto forge its own fortuity in order to further antidiscrimination efforts and\neffectively reach toward the state of true equality and human flourishing. To that\nend, coalition building that focuses on common values and interests rather than\nidentity politics might be the solution to press upon upending the dominant status\nquo. Whether individual marginalized groups can lift their focus off identity\npolitics and then merge with other groups into multilateral coalitions striving.\nupon democratic values is the difficult challenge that remains to be seen. But\nonce there, the potential might make such coalitions worth the effort. Particularly\nfor sexual minorities within such coalitions, liberationist approaches might need\nto guide the movement to advance more collectively and transformatively. That\nnotion is the possibility that propels us beyond queer sacrifice and toward\nfortuity.\n495.

    "abstract": "This Article interprets the Supreme Court\\u27s decision, Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, as a critical extension of Derrick Bell\\u27s interest-convergence thesis into the LGBTQ movement.
