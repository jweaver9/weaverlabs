PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S WAR ON FEDERAL JUDICIAL DIVERSITY Carl Tobias• In Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the candidate promised to nominate and confirm federal judges who would possess ideologically conservative perspectives. Across President Trump's first twenty-seven months, the chief executive implemented numerous actions to effectuate his campaign pledge. Indeed, federal judicial selection may be the area in which President Trump has achieved the most substantial success throughout his first twenty-seven months in office, as many of Trump's supporters within and outside the government recognize. Nevertheless, the chief executive's achievements, principally when nominating and confirming stalwart conservatives to the appellate court bench, have imposed numerous critical detrimental effects. Most important for the purposes of this Article, a disturbing pattern that implicates a stunning paucity of minority nominees materialized rather quickly. Moreover, in the apparent rush to install staunch conservative ideologues in the maximum possible number of appeals court vacancies, the Republican White House and Senate majority have eviscerated numerous invaluable, longstanding federal judicial selection conventions. Although it is comparatively early in the service of those judges whom the Trump Administration has confirmed, some jurists have already issued opinions that undermine the rights of ethnic minorities, women, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer individuals or that make the judiciary seem equally partisan and politicized as the political branches. These developments have undercut public respect for the selection process, the presidency, the Senate, and the * Williams Chair in Law, University of Richmond School of Law.

The White House nominated and confirmed myriad individuals who possessed these attributes and who have displayed those qualities once the United States Senate confirmed the individuals to the federal bench.6 The President has incessantly reminded the American people about his enormous success in nominating and appointing jurists who exhibit these characteristics. 7 He even campaigned on this issue during the 2018 midterm Senate elections, admonishing the electorate to vote for Republican upper chamber candidates because retaining a Grand Old Party (\"GOP\") Senate majority was critical to continuing Trump's outsized success in nominating and confirming the particular types of circuit and district court members whom he had promised to appoint.s Indeed, federal judicial selection may be the area in which President Trump has realized the most impressive success throughout his first 27 months in office, as many Trump supporters within and outside the government recognize.9 However, 5.

Most significant for the purposes of this Article, a troubling pattern that involved a striking dearth of minority nominees materialized comparatively rapidly.12 The White House has established a confirmation record through its appointment of 37 court of appeals jurists in President Trump's first 27 months and its considerable success in nominating candidates for empty circuit and district court positions. Despite these achievements, merely 9 out of 95 appellate court and district court appointees are ethnic minority judges, only 23 in 174 nominees are persons of color,13 and only 2 nominees constitute lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (\"LGBTQ\") individuals.14 Moreover, in the seeming hurry to place stalwart conservative ideologues in the greatest number of appeals court vacancies, the Republican Executive Branch and Senate majority have undermined or deemphasized a number of critical, longstanding federal judicial selection rules and customs. Most significantly, the White House has failed to undertake assiduous, comprehensive consultation with home state senators before tendering nominations and throughout the confirmation process.15 More specifically, President Trump selected 10.

These strictures and customs govern the confirmation process and senatorial courtesy, particularly as manifested in the lack of respect accorded to the blue slips that protect home state senators' prerogatives in the nomination and confirmation processes for judges who will serve in their jurisdictions. The Republican White House and senators have essentially ignored ABA examinations and ratings throughout the nomination and confirmation processes. The practices identified might well have substantially reduced the number of accomplished, mainstream, and diverse candidates who received nomination and confirmation. Even though it remains somewhat early in the tenure of President Trump's Administration, this evaluation ascertains that the rampant partisanship, systematic divisiveness, and nonstop paybacks, which have long attended the judicial nomination and confirmation processes, have continued their counterproductive downward spiral. Although it is comparatively early in the service of those judges whom the Trump Administration has confirmed, some jurists have already issued opinions that undercut the rights of ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ individuals or which make the judiciary seem equally partisan and politicized as the political branches.17 The striking lack of ethnic minorities, LGBTQ individuals, and women may correspondingly forfeit or restrict the benefits of a diverse judiciary, such as improved federal court decision making, more equitable decision making, and greater public confidence in the court system. These phenomena have undermined citizen regard for the judicial selection process, the presidency, the Senate, and the judiciary. It is essential to remember that when Donald Trump campaigned for the presidency and captured the White House, he vowed to serve as President for all of the American people. Trump's failure to honor this pledge means that increased judicial diversity assumes even greater significance. Because the 133 circuit and district court vacancies as of April 29, 2019, present an unusual opportunity, the compelling dearth of minority representation among Trump's judicial 16.

This Article undertakes that effort. Part II of the Article explores the historical background of the appointments process, which implicates expanded diversification respecting the federal bench and why that enhancement is crucial. This Part highlights that increased minority representation improves the quality of judicial determinations, reduces biases that undermine the delivery of justice, and expands public confidence in the federal judiciary by making the courts reflect the populace. Part III reviews how modern Presidents and contemporary Senates have treated diversity when they nominate and confirm jurists. This Part ascertains that Democratic Presidents and senators generally favor increasing diversity on the federal bench for the reasons denominated in the first segment, while Republican chief executives and Senate members typically evince less concern about emphasizing diversity and greater interest in nominating and appointing ideological conservatives and stressing the concept of \"merit.\" GOP politicians emphasize these phenomena, principally because upper echelon executive branch officials who have responsibility for selection and Senate members apparently believe that conservative nominees will become superior judges, that the \"pool\" of highly-qualified ethnic minority, female, and LG BTQ candidates is not substantial enough, and that too many of those individuals who are well qualified are insufficiently conservative. Part IV examines the selection record that Trump has assembled, finding that this White House confirmed the fewest persons of color, women, and LGBTQ jurists since Ronald Reagan's presidency, when dramatically fewer ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ individuals were practicing lawyers. Part V assesses the consequences of the nomination and confirmation processes detailed, especially since the current presidency's advent. The Trump Administration commenced during 2017, which provides this White House considerable time for remedying its deficient nomination and appointment of highly-qualified, diverse individuals, whose nomination and confirmation would furnish numerous advantages. Part VI of this Article supplies recommendations that might help confirm substantially greater numbers of ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ nominees to the federal bench. 18.

THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF FEDERAL COURT DIVERSITY A. The Appointments Process The Office of White House Counsel (\"White House Counsel\") assumes chief responsibility for nominations and some responsibility for confirmations. 19 The Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") provides assistance with critical selection and important confirmation duties, primarily analyzing candidates whom home state politicians suggest and helping to prepare nominees for hearings.20 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") undertakes background checks of these aspirants.21 Moreover, the ABA evaluates and rates candidates, an invaluable service that the ABA has provided since Dwight Eisenhower's Administration.22 However, the Trump Administration officers' discharge of their selection responsibilities and the Republican Senate majority's fulfillment of its advice and consent duties have both sharply confined the ABA's responsibilities and frequently denigrated the organization as a \"political group.\"23 President Trump and GOP senators have essentially ignored the ABA's examinations and rankings, and certain lawmakers have even attacked some evaluations and ratings as politically motivated.24 The Senate Judiciary Committee discharges multiple obligations across the confirmation process, specifically investigating designees as well as staging hearings, committee discussions, and votes on nominees.25 Particular senators from jurisdictions that experience openings play central roles in the nomination and confirmation processes, mostly identifying strong prospects for White House consideration and selection, and familiarizing colleagues with the individuals whom the President nominates.26 B.

The Early History Before the Carter Administration, nearly all chief executives devoted relatively minimal attention to nominating and confirming ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ individuals.33 This disinterest, and even opposition, resulted partly because white males dominated the legal profession, comparatively small numbers of minorities were practicing attorneys, and there was considerable discomfort with, and even racism, sexism, and homophobia directed toward, ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ individuals practicing law, much less potentially serving as federal judges.34 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt nominated and confirmed Florence Allen as the initial female appellate court jurist in 1934, but his administration confirmed no ethnic minorities to Article III judgeships.35 President Harry Truman appointed African American William Hastie to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Burnita Shelton Matthews to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.36 President Eisenhower appointed African American Scovel Richardson and Mary Donlon to the United States Customs Court.37 President John Kennedy appointed Sarah Hughes to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, while he appointed African Americans Thurgood Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, James Parsons to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Wade McCree to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, and Spottswood Robinson to the United States District 32.

Ill. MODERN HISTORY OF DIVERSIFYING THE FEDERAL COURTS A. The Carter Administration Only with the advent of the Carter Administration did chief executives devote comparatively serious attention to diversity on the federal bench. Contemporary Presidents and senates have comprehensively deployed rather analogous practices when nominating and confirming jurists.42 The chief executives and chambers have also carefully evaluated the issue of enhancing minority representation across the courts, although individual Democratic and Republican Presidents and senators have accorded differing emphases to the idea.43 All Democratic chief executives and most Democratic senate members have generally stressed diversity, even as numerous Republican Presidents and many GOP senators have deemphasized or even ignored the concept.44 38.

Id. 2019] WAR ON FEDERAL JUDICIAL DIVERSITY 541 The records for nominating and confirming talented, conservative and mainstream ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ individuals, which modern chief executives assembled, illuminate the complications entailed in realizing enhanced diversity, which implicates ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. The federal appellate and district courts encompassed minuscule numbers of ethnic minority and female judges and no LGBTQ jurists before Jimmy Carter won his presidential election, as recounted earlier.45 The Carter Administration deployed effective procedures to nominate and confirm highly qualified people of color and women for the circuit and district courts. 46 A critical instrument that Carter employed was United States Circuit Judge Nominating Commissions, which the President explicitly instructed to enhance the nomination and confirmation of ethnic minority and female jurists.47 When Carter determined that his Administration and the Senate were achieving insufficient progress regarding diversity, the President issued a revised executive order, elaborating on a previous order, that enunciated additional guidance on judicial selection, increased representation for people of color and women, and expressly required \"special efforts to identify qualified minority and female candidates.\"48 In a May 1978 speech to the Los Angeles County Bar Association, Carter decided to reinforce his initiative by criticizing the \"abominable record\" of minority and female judicial appointments, which the United States had compiled, emphasizing that a new judgeship statute would provide a \"unique opportunity to make our judiciary more fully representative of our population.\"49 In October of that same year, Congress passed the Omnibus Judgeships legislation, which authorized the federal judiciary's greatest expansion in United States history by creating thirty-five new appellate court positions and 11 7 new district court positions on which the Carter Administration capitalized to diversify the bench.50 The President concomitantly asked that senators implement 45.

Republican Administrations Republican chief executives who served after Carter achieved comparatively limited progress in enhancing diversity on the federal judiciary. This was principally because the Presidents refused to emphasize diversity, but also because the chief executives adopted very few, if any, comprehensive efforts that would improve minority representation on the federal bench.53 President Reagan's Administration helpfully demonstrates most of these phenomena. For example, the chief executive pledged to nominate and confirm well qualified, ideological conservatives, asserting that the individuals would exercise judicial restraint once appointed.54 President Reagan specifically opposed Carter's diversity initiative and even disbanded his predecessor's United States Circuit Judge Nominating Commission and reinstated the pre-Carter selection methods whereby senators and other entities and individuals proffered recommendations for candidates to DOJ.55 Reagan concomitantly instituted virtually no special endeavors to recruit, identify, nominate, and confirm women and even fewer actions to pinpoint, tap, and appoint ethnic minorities. Therefore, it should not have been surprising that the President compiled the worst record for confirming African Americans since the Eisenhower Administration, even though Reagan did appoint relatively many Latinos.56 During his presidential tenure, Reagan seated thirty-one women, seven African Americans, fourteen Latinos, and two Asian 51.

Bush remarked that he would institute judicial selection procedures that mirrored the practices that Reagan had implemented, and the Bush Administration conducted very few distinctive actions that would search for, discover, nominate, and confirm highly qualified minorities.58 President H.W. Bush appointed thirty-six women, eleven African Americans, and eight Latinos; however, the President failed to confirm a single Asian American, Native American, or LG BTQ jurist. 59 President George W. Bush enjoyed somewhat greater success than his father because he apparently dedicated considerable resources to increasing particular dimensions of representation, although he clearly enjoyed a considerably larger pool of individuals to draw upon than his father.60 For instance, President W. Bush appointed seventy-one women, twenty-four African Americans, thirty Latinos, and four Asian Americans, yet the Bush Administration did not confirm any Native American or LGBTQ judges, similarly to his father's presidency.61 The lack of interest in promoting enhanced diversity throughout the GOP Administrations of Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush seemingly can be attributed to multiple factors, which enjoyed varying importance and emphases in the three administrations. Perhaps most significant of these factors was the substantial explicit significance that all three Presidents attached to (1) nominating and confirming the maximum number of ideologically conservative, highly qualified candidates; (2) the concomitant perception that relatively small numbers of female prospects held that political viewpoint; and (3) the perception that even fewer ethnic 57.

Democratic Administrations Contemporary Democratic Presidents have achieved considerably greater success in expanding diversity on the federal bench. This is principally because the chief executives initiated special endeavors to recruit, denominate, propose, and confirm substantial numbers of extremely competent persons of color, women, and LGBTQ individuals. For example, President Bill Clinton expressly requested that a multitude of home state elected politicians search for, designate, and suggest numerous, mainstream, exceptional ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ candidates, while the chief executive instructed White House and DOJ officials to institute efforts that would promote increased federal court diversity.64 President Clinton created records for appointing people of color, women, and LGBTQ judges, confirming 106 women, sixty-one African Americans, twenty-four Latinos, five Asian Americans, 62.

Perhaps most critical, he arranged ten hearings during 2017-18 in which two circuit court and four district court nominees appeared without the minority party's permission; this number acutely contrasts to Democrats' employment of three hearings in Obama's entire presidency which the GOP had clearly allowed.102 Many sessions for circuit nominees can appear rushed with a lack of sufficient care for designees who might become life-tenured appointees on courts of last resort in their regions of the country. 103 Most debates before committee votes analogously lack content and context. For example, members rarely engage on issues related to crucial judicial qualifications.104 One peculiar departure from \"regular order\" is Grassley's determination to set panel hearings, and even votes, before the ABA assembles candidate ratings, notwithstanding incessant pleas from California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Ranking Member, to have ballots after the ABA concludes ratings.105 He vociferously argues that this external political organization cannot dictate panel scheduling.106 It was https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/10/10/2018/nominations; Hearing to Consider Pending Nominations Before the S.

First, the White House commits minuscule numbers of minority and LGBTQ employees to appointments.129 Trump also has not insisted, or even requested, that home state politicians tender many excellent, conservative and moderate, people of color, women, and LGBTQ aspirants.130 Further, the White House has rarely sought proposals of candidates from sources-namely plentiful minority, female, and LGBTQ politicians, as well as numerous minority, women's, and LGBTQ interest, political, and bar 125. Candidate, nominee, Senate, and White House privacy needs may justify less than comprehensive transparency.

This is manifested by their participation in litigation of, or developing federal or state legislative or executive branch policy on, issues that demonstrate opposition, and even hostility, to diversity.

His negligible attention to diversity's expansion constitutes a lost opportunity for increasing the quality of justice that litigants deserve and courts must supply. Improved diversity furnishes the crucial benefits reviewed previously: this enhances decision-making with constructive, different views, eliminates or reduces prejudices, which can deprive litigants of fairness, and increases confidence that federal jurists will equitably treat parties.151 Appointing plentiful talented, conservative and moderate persons of color, women, and LGBTQ people would help fill the 133 vacancies and constrict the rampant politicization, divisiveness, and nonstop paybacks that plague the modern federal branches of government and the appointments process. Seating these candidates in the empty posts might show that Republicans and Democrats can meaningfully collaborate to fill the myriad vacancies for the good of the courts, the presidency, the Senate, and the nation. The country has substantial numbers of excellent, conservative and moderate, ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ people from whom to choose, so these candidates would rather easily secure appointment.152 Certain justifications for not promoting diversity, which could have enjoyed a modicum of plausibility much earlier, lack any persuasiveness now. For instance, the superb, conservative persons of color, women, and LGBTQ aspirants-namely Trump's nine confirmees and his fourteen other nominees, including Bumatay, Smith, Ruiz, and Rowland-dramatically repudiate the condescending suppositions that confirming capable minority, female, and LGBTQ nominees will erode merit in the judiciary because the pool of qualified candidates is small or lacks enough conservatives.153 151. See sources cited supra notes 27-30. 152. Circuit Judges Elizabeth Branch and St. Eve and District Judges Gren Scholer, Rodriguez, Claria Horn Boom and Annemarie Carney Axon easily won confirmation on strong roll call votes and District Judges Otake and Moorer as well as nine white female District Judges easily won approval on voice votes. Circuit Judges Ho, Nalbandian, Amy Barrett, Joan Larsen, Allison Eid, and Britt Grant experienced greater difficulty, and the Senate confirmed Thapar, Allison Jones Rushing, and Neomi Rao with no Democratic senators' votes.

Trump need only capitalize on that potential. In 2016, Trump campaigned and won partly because the candidate pledged to confirm ideologically conservative judges who shared his or Republican positions on social policy and culture war issues, especially diversity. Trump honored this promise by appointing two Supreme Court Justices, thirty-seven circuit jurists, and many district judges who satisfied this description.154 Trump incessantly touts his record-breaking circuit approvals and even urged that 2018 voters elect Republican senators, so that he might continue appointing even more analogous jurists,155 a strategy that arguably proved effective because the GOP slightly enhanced its majority. He enjoyed considerable success. For example, the Gorsuch and Kavanaugh appointments have made the Supreme Court more ideologically conservative while apparently solidifying a five-Justice conservative majority on certain issues essential to diversity, such as affirmative action, voting rights, reproductive freedom, and LGBTQ individuals' rights.156 The Trump appointees to the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have also seemingly made those appeals courts more conservative, but he has only modified the Third Circuit's composition from a majority of judges whom Democratic Presidents confirmed to a majority whom Republican chief executives appointed.157 Nevertheless, some 154.

For example, Fifth Circuit Judge Ho lamented the \"moral tragedy\" of abortion in the \"fetal remains\" case and Seventh Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett allowed corporations to racially segregate employees in their workplaces.158 Trump also vilified many federal jurists, especially those who serve in the Ninth Circuit, and criticized their opinions ruling that his initiatives that touch diversity are legally deficient. For example, Trump denigrated Western District of Washington Judge James Robart, who resolved the initial travel ban case, as a \"so-called judge\"l59 and Northern District of California Judge Jon Tigar, who decided the first challenge to Trump's modified rules for asylum seekers, as an Obama judge, while then-candidate Trump argued that Southern District of California Judge Gonsalvo Curiel would not rule Circuit is 6-6, but the court has no current vacancies.

[We do have extraordinary] dedicated judges doing equal right to [litigants]. That independent judiciary is something for which we should all be thankful.\"163 Trump retorted that Chief Justice Roberts was mistaken because the federal courts have many Obama judges who rule against the executive, particularly on national security issues about which the jurists know little and that this jeopardizes Americans' safety, while he described the Ninth Circuit as a \"total disaster [,which] is out of control [and] is reversed more than any circuit,'' intimating that Congress must seriously consider dividing the appellate court.164 Many of these efforts have deleterious impacts. The actions can make federal judges and courts appear more partisan and politicized and, thus, resemble the legislative and executive branches. The initiatives may also undermine judicial independence, separation of powers, checks and balances, the rule of law and democracy, make the judiciary appear beholden to, or captured by, one party or another government branch, as well as continue, and even accelerate, the selection process' counterproductive decline. The dynamics identified could undercut public respect for the judiciary, the President, the Senate, and the selection process. In sum, despite the multiple, clear advantages of increasing minority representation, the rather nascent Trump presidency has devoted minuscule resources to expanding diversity. However, 160.

Thus, Part VI of this Article provides recommendations for significantly enhancing the number of ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ court members. VI. SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE Trump now must implement multifarious special constructs that have functioned well previously and promise to increase judicial diversity. One valuable, dependable procedure would be elevating to the appeals courts numerous accomplished, conservative and moderate, ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ district court appointees whom Presidents George W. Bush and Obama nominated and confirmed.165 That measure is time honored and efficacious, as the candidates have assembled accessible, comprehensive records and can proffer much relevant experience derived from years of trial court service, and importantly the Senate has already thoroughly evaluated and confirmed them once.166 Examples include the following: Judges Thapar, Diane Humetewa, who could become the first Native American court of appeals jurist; Pamela Chen and Alison Nathan, either one, if appointed, would be the initial lesbian appointed to any court of appeals; and Paul Oetken, who might become the first gay judge to serve on the Second Circuit.167 A related and helpful source for circuit nominees is the pool of Justices who are serving on state supreme courts. This measure is venerable and effective, as the prospects have compiled similarly available, full records and may furnish expertise because much of their work resembles that of federal appellate jurists. Presidents George W. Bush and Obama carefully applied this mechanism,168 165. Unfortunately President Bush appointed no LGBTQ judges. See supra note 61 and accompanying text. 166.

Senator Grassley continued the venerable tradition of not requiring another hearing for many nominees who had a hearing in the previous Congress. Because any of the 15 Obama nominees whom Trump renamed, who was not confirmed in 2018, required and received renomination and did not have a hearing in the 115th Congress and the panel will have several new members, Senator Graham may deem it advisable to convene additional hearings in 2019. 172.

Most crucial is enhancing diversity on the federal bench, which contemporary Democratic Presidents have stressed but modern Republican chief executives have ignored or downplayed. Trump must assign increasing ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ judicial representation much greater priority as well as communicate to all involved with selection and the American citizenry that he believes that improving diversity has substantial importance. The White House Counsel should systematically convey the message that diversity's rigorous supplementation has compelling priority that resembles appointing conservative jurists. This should also be communicated through the actions of White House Counsel Office employees; the DOJ, which investigates candidates and prepares nominees for hearings; the Judiciary Committee, which evaluates nominees and stages hearings, discussions and votes; and home state politicians, who propose multiple outstanding candidates for each vacancy and introduce· nominees to Senate colleagues. The White House Counsel should broadly prescribe suggestions to accentuate ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ diversity on the federal bench. For instance, Counsel Office employees and others working on selection ought to encompass minorities while committing sufficient resources to efficaciously discharge responsibility for improving diverse representation. All participating in the nomination process must avidly recruit, examine, and suggest numerous able, conservative and mainstream, people of color, women, and LGBTQ candidates, particularly by contacting individuals, lawmakers, as well as ethnic minority, women's, and LGBTQ political, interest and bar entities, especially the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, which are familiar with designees. The Counsel should convince every home state lawmaker to seek out, pursue, and suggest excellent, conservative and moderate persons of color, women, and LGBTQ aspirants. One constructive technique that many officials deploy is bipartisan selection panels because they are familiar with numerous prospects who could be exceptional judges.173 Counsel then must evaluate, interview, and propose these submissions, asking the President to seriously evaluate nominating them. Trump might lead by example with the aspirants' consequent nomination.

A helpful illustration was the nomination of two well qualified, conservative or centrist ethnic minority Texas district court nominees, Asian American Karen Gren Scholer and Latino Fernando Rodriguez, whom the bipartisan Texas Judicial Evaluation Commission strongly recommended, Texas Republican Senators Cornyn and Cruz powerfully supported, and the Senate smoothly confirmed.175 Equally compelling was the nomination of two accomplished, conservative Illinois Seventh Circuit choices, Amy St. Eve and Michael Scudder, whom an Illinois bipartisan panel avidly proposed, Democratic Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth strenuously favored, and the chamber easily approved as witnessed by the nominees' swiftly-arranged uncontroversial committee hearing, discussion and report, and expeditious, smooth chamber debate and ballot.176 In short, much 174.

Bush and Trump, relied on the ABA's deep experience, mammoth network of expert assessors, and full, informative reports.178 Dependence on ABA analyses and rankings in candidates' pre-nomination analyses might reduce the embarrassment that can be imposed on Trump designees whom the ABA rates not qualified.179 Ultimate confirmation of most nominees with this ranking indicates that ABA input can helpfully alert selection participants to putative concerns about nominees.180 Trump as well should reconsider the decision to emphasize filling appellate vacancies with conservative nominees in states that GOP senators represent to the nearly complete exclusion of related important factors, especially diversity. For instance, the Administration should institute a system that focuses on all circuit and district courts. A constructive approach could be prioritizing nominations by first selecting nominees who decrease the eighty-four emergency vacancies.181 The White House should emphasize the 125 district openings and the numerous tribunals with large judicial complements and vacancy percentages, which encompass districts in business-meeting; 164 CONG. REC. 84858 (daily ed. July 10, 2018) (Bennett confirmation). 177. See supra notes 88, 101, 109-110 and accompanying text. Similar disputes arose in Ohio, Washington, and New Jersey.

This recommendation also treats districts' compelling need to fill many openings and the lack of nominees from states that Democrats represent. 572 WAKE FOREST LAW REVIEW [Vol. 54 California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York.182 Those states' magnitude ensures a substantial pool of well qualified, conservative and moderate, ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ candidates. 183 Trump should institute this measure by according home state politicians more responsibility for recruiting, discovering, and proffering strong candidates whom he names.184 After Trump taps strong ethnic minority, female, and LGBTQ picks, the White House, the DOJ, and each party's senators should promptly collaborate by providing thorough, fair confirmation processes. For example, Trump might ask that every senator powerfully support nominees, that DOJ carefully prepare selections for the confirmation regime, and that the panel schedule prompt, rigorous, and equitable hearings, discussions, and ballots. Once nominees capture approval, the Senate must swiftly, robustly, and fairly debate and vote. The evaluation above shows that the confirmation wars that preceded Trump's inauguration have persisted during his presidency. However, certain phenomena suggest that Republicans and Democrats must seriously assess ideas that can permanently improve the dismal process because the few appointments that the GOP permitted throughout Obama's last half term partially explain the dramatically reduced interparty collaboration so early in Trump's presidency.185 This Administration's deletion, modification, or deemphasis of many procedures that had operated rather efficaciously accelerates the measures' steady decline, while the factors scrutinized exacerbate the apparently dwindling prospects for remedying the concerns.186 However, there is one promising approach that could at once improve the present selection regime and enhance bench diversity. Trump and senators can adopt a bipartisan judiciary that would enable the party not possessing White House control to recommend a 182. See Archive of Judicial Vacancies (2019), supra note 93 (showing 125 district openings). 183. See supra notes 92-94. Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania have many vacancies, but only the latter has a Democratic senator. See supra note 42 (sending five Florida district nominees). States, like Nebraska and Idaho, with few active judges, deserve emphasis, as one vacancy can be crippling. 28 U.S.C. § 133 (2012). 184. Trump has apparently deferred significantly to many home state politicians, especially on district vacancies. See supra notes 7 4-76 and accompanying text. 185. Tobias, supra note 125, at 1107; see John Gramlich, Federal Judicial Picks Have Become More Contentious, and Trump's Are No Exception, PEW RES. CTR.

New York apparently instituted the first system that permitted the senator whose party lacked the executive to recommend one in a few district aspirants.188 The two New York nominee packages, comprising three Second Circuit, and nine district picks, suggest that Trump and the senators used a similar process whereby he and the senators chose some nominees.189 Congress should combine the bipartisan judiciary with a law authorizing sixty-five seats. This would operationalize 2019 Judicial Conference suggestions for Congress, which the courts' policymaking arm bases on conservative projections of case and workloads that will afford courts necessary resources.190 Conjoining a bipartisan judiciary and sixty-five posts could enhance judicial diversity and supply other benefits. These concepts would give both parties incentives to cooperate, create a relatively diverse judiciary, and provide courts with critical resources. The constructs would increase diversity by enabling Democrats to propose some nominees and might halt or slow the process' downward slide. Effectuation will require care, although bipartisan courts may be fashioned to satisfy the Constitution.191 187. Michael Gerhardt, Judicial Selection as War, 36 U.C. DAVIS L.

The packages included two Obama district nominees, Gary Brown and Diane Gujarati, whom Trump renamed and two Bush district appointees, Richard Sullivan and Joseph Bianco, as Second Circuit nominees. See supra note 120; Eighteenth Wave, supra note 93. However, few senators apply a bipartisan judiciary to circuits, as the vacancies are rare, the courts include several states, and perceptions that appointing these judges is political, complex and critical suggest that the idea may be ineffective. Differing rules, such as districts that have bipartisan courts, would apply within states and would be issues for negotiation among the senators and Trump.

    "abstract": "In Donald Trump\\u27s 2016 presidential campaign, the candidate promised to nominate and confirm federal judges who would possess ideologically conservative perspectives. Across President Trump\\u27s first twenty-seven months, the chief executive implemented numerous actions to effectuate his campaign pledge. Indeed, federal judicial selection may be the area in which President Trump has achieved the most substantial success throughout his first twenty-seven months in office, as many of Trump\\u27s supporters within and outside the government recognize. Nevertheless, the chief executive\\u27s achievements, principally when nominating and confirming stalwart conservatives to the appellate court bench, have imposed numerous critical detrimental effects. Most important for the purposes of this Article, a disturbing pattern that implicates a stunning paucity of minority nominees materialized rather quickly. Moreover, in the apparent rush to install staunch conservative ideologues in the maximum possible number of appeals court vacancies, the Republican White House and Senate majority have eviscerated numerous invaluable, longstanding federal judicial selection conventions. Although it is comparatively early in the service of those judges whom the Trump Administration has confirmed, some jurists have already issued opinions that undermine the rights of ethnic minorities, women, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer individuals or that make the judiciary seem equally partisan and politicized as the political branches. These developments have undercut public respect for the selection process, the presidency, the Senate, and the judiciary. Because the 133 current vacancies present an unusual opportunity, the compelling dearth of minority representation among Trump\\u27s judicial nominees and confirmees as one critical front in his administration\\u27s  war on diversity  deserves evaluation",
