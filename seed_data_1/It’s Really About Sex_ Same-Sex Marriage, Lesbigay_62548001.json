As many as nine million children living in the United States have a gay or lesbian parent,1 and twenty-five percent of all lesbigay couples are raising children.2  Indeed, marriage and parenting are aspirations of most Americans, yet these rights have often been denied to gays and lesbians.3  For many years, states maintained legal presumptions against awarding custody to a lesbigay parent,4 assuming that doing so would not serve the child’s best interests. However, much has changed over the last quarter-century and most courts now consider a parent’s homosexuality to be irrelevant in child-custody decisions.5  All but eight states (i.e. Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin) permit adoption by gay and lesbian couples.6  All but two states – Nebraska and Utah – allow them to serve as foster parents.7  Yet, only four states allow same-sex couples to legally marry or enter into civil unions.8 The national debate surrounding same-sex marriage has galvanized renewed interest in the issue of lesbigay parenting,9 and in the last several years ballot measures have been proposed in sixteen states to prohibit gays and   1.

According to the U.S. Census, there were 594,691 same-sex households in 2000, but research suggests that the census likely undercounted the number of lesbigay households by 16–19%.  See James G.

Since courts must take into account any factor that might have a bearing on the best interests of the child, they will consider a parent’s sexual orientation if it can be shown to have a present adverse impact on a particular child.

(stating that “effective immediately, it is the policy of the Department of Social Services that children will not be placed in the homes of persons who identify themselves as homosexual”).  8. Only Massachusetts extends marriage rights to same-sex couples.  See Goodridge v. Dep’t. of Pub. Health, 789 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003).  California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Vermont have civil union or domestic partnership laws, and Hawaii has a reciprocal beneficiaries law.  See CAL. FAM. CODE § 297 (West 2007); CONN. GEN. STAT.

As of 2006, only five (Belgium, Canada, The Netherlands, South Africa, and Spain) of the 191 countries in the world allow same-sex marriage, and the constitutions of at least thirty-two countries explicitly define marriage as the union of a man and woman.  See Lynn D. Wardle, What is Marriage? 6 WHITTIER J. OF CHILD & FAMILY ADVOCACY 53, 67 (2006).  9. The issue has also been central in international debates over gay marriage.  See e.g., Larry Rohter, Lesbian Judge Fights Chilean Court for Taking Her Children, N.Y. TIMES, July 20, 2006, at A3 (reporting case of lesbian mother in Chile who was denied custody of her children due to her homosexuality, and noting that the issue of lesbigay parenting has been central in the emerging Chilean debates over gay marriage). 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM  IT’S REALLY ABOUT SEX 129 lesbians from adopting children.10  Asserting that the central purposes of marriage are procreation and childrearing, opponents of lesbigay marriage argue that children are harmed or disadvantaged when reared in homosexual households:11 Man–woman marriage is the irreplaceable foundation of the child-rearing mode . . . that correlates . . . with the optimal outcomes deemed crucial for a child’s – and hence society’s – well being.  These outcomes include physical, mental, and emotional health and development; academic performance and levels of attainment; and avoidance of crime and other forms of self- and other-destructive behavior such as drug abuse and high-risk sexual conduct.12 They further argue that since marriage is a social institution that helps determine sexual and procreative norms by “guid[ing] individuals’ identities, perceptions, aspirations, and conduct,” same-sex marriage will serve to change social norms by legitimizing lesbigay parenting,13 resulting in greater numbers of children being raised by non-biological parents: [A]ccepting same-sex marriage necessarily means accepting that the  societal institution of marriage is intended primarily for the benefit of the partners to the marriage, and only secondarily for the children born into it. And it means abolishing the norm that children . . . have a prima facie right to know and be reared within their own biological family by their mother and father.14 The effects of lesbigay parenting on children was a key issue in recent litigation in Hawaii,15 Vermont,16 Massachusetts,17 Washington18, and New York19   10.

In the 1993 case of Baehr v. Lewin, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was potentially discriminatory and an Equal Protection violation of Hawaii’s constitution.20 On remand to trial court,21 the parties centered their arguments “almost entirely around the issue of the possible effects on children of allowing same-sex marriages.  All of the witnesses called for both sides of the case either were social scientists or commented on the social scientific research, in order to persuade the court which family structure would ultimately be in the best interest of the child.”22 Lesbigay parenting also was the touchstone issue in the 2003 case Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health, in which the Massachusetts Supreme Court held 4-3 that denying of marriage rights to lesbigay couples violated the Massachusetts constitution.23  Two of the three rationales proffered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts involved parenting.24  Massachusetts argued that the primary purpose of marriage was to provide a “favorable setting for procreation” and to “ensure[] the optimal setting for child rearing,” which it defined it “a two-parent family with one parent of each sex.”25  But the Court held that denying marriage benefits to same-sex couples “cannot plausibly further” the State’s policy of protecting the welfare of children.26  Utilizing “rational basis” review, it struck down the Massachusetts marriage law as a violation of the state constitution’s equal protection guarantee.27  According to the Court, the State had not proffered persuasive evidence that lesbigay parenting was harmful to children.  The Court noted that lesbigay parenting was a reality, and that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples deprived them of the financial and other benefits that positively impacted the parenting of children in married   18.

(holding that “[o]n remand, in accordance with the ‘strict scrutiny’ standard, the burden will rest on Lewin to overcome the presumption that [the statute disallowing same-sex marriage] is unconstitutional.”)  In 1998, Hawaii voters approved a ballot referendum amending the Hawaii Constitution to grant the legislature the authority to restrict marriage to male-female couples.  See Baehr v. Miike, 994 P.2d 566 (Haw. 1999).  21. See Baehr v. Miike, 1996 WL 694235 (Haw. Cir. Ct. 1996).  22. Richard N.

In fact, it undermines it.  Civil marriage provides tangible legal protections and economic benefits to married couples and their children, and tens of thousands of children are currently being raised by same-sex couples in New York.  Depriving these children of the benefits and protections available to the children of opposite-sex couples isn antithetical to their welfare, as defendants do not dispute . . . .  [I]f anything, the exclusion of same-sex couples from the legal protections incident to marriage exposes their children to the precise risk that the State argues the marriage laws are designed to secure against. . . .  [T]o rule otherwise would mean that the thousands of New York children actually being raised in homes headed by two unmarried persons could have only one legal parent, not the two who want them”) (internal citations omitted); See also Lewis v. Harris, 908 A.2d 196, 216–17 (N.J. 2006) (noting that “the economic and financial inequities that are borne by same-sex domestic partners are borne by their children too.  With fewer financial benefits and protections available, those children are disadvantaged in a way that children in married households are not.  Children have the same universal needs and wants, whether they are raised in a same-sex or opposite-sex family, yet under the current system they are treated differently”). “In 2004, the United States Government Accountability Office identified a total of 1138 federal statutory provisions classified to the United States Code in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving rights, benefits, and protections.”  Pawelski et al., supra note 1, at 352; see also id. at 357–58 (listing the many legal and financial benefits of marriage).

[G]iven the rational relationship standard and that the legislature was provided with testimony that children thrive in opposite-sex marriage environments, the legislature acted within its power to limit the status of marriage.

Our belief that children raised by same-sex couples should fare the same as children raised in traditional families is just that: a passionately held but utterly untested belief.31 In an equally vigorous dissent, Justice Cordy opined that the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples satisfied the deferential rational basis test: We must assume that the Legislature . . . would be familiar with many recent studies that variously support the proposition that children raised in intact families headed by same-sex couples fare as well on many measures as children raised in similar families headed by opposite-sex couples; support the proposition that children of same-sex couples fare worse on some measures; or reveal notable differences between the two groups of children that warrant further study. . . . . . . . [Thus], the Legislature could rationally conclude that a family environment with married opposite-sex parents remains the optimal social structure in which to bear children, and that the raising of children by same-sex couples, who by definition cannot be the two sole biological parents of a child and cannot provide children with a parental authority figure of each gender, presents an alternative structure for child rearing that has not yet proved itself beyond reasonable scientific dispute to be as optimal as the biologically based marriage norm.32 Thus, courts are looking to the extant social science research on lesbigay parenting.  This research addresses the five sets of concerns that courts, policymakers, and commentators frequently express about the possible negative effects of lesbigay parenting on children.33  First, there is a concern that lesbigay  thrive.  We reiterate that the rational basis standard is a highly deferential standard. . . . . We emphasize that it is not the province of this court to pass on the merits of the arguments and studies presented to the legislature . . . . And at risk of sounding monotonous, we repeat that the rational basis standard is extremely deferential.  There are many examples of laws upheld on rational basis grounds where strong policy arguments opposing such laws have been advanced.  But legislative bodies, not courts, hold the power to make public policy determinations, and where no suspect classification or fundamental right is at stake, that power is nearly limitless.”) (internal citations omitted).  31.

[that] is harmful to the individual and society (which is why children need to be protected from it)”, and proposing, based on folk psychology, that lesbigay parenting has five types of negative effects on children). 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM  IT’S REALLY ABOUT SEX 133 parenting may produce psychological or adjustment problems in children such as anxiety, depression, lowered self esteem, or behavior problems, and that homosexual parents themselves are more likely to have serious mental health problems that may adversely impact their children.34  Second, there is the concern that children of lesbigay parents will be teased or rejected by peers, and thus experience difficulties in their social relationships.35  Third, there is the concern that children of lesbigay parents will have gender identity problems and are more likely to become homosexual.36  Fourth, some argue that children do best when raised by a mother and a father because men and women each contribute something unique and important to childrearing.  Finally, some argue that gays and lesbians are inherently unfit to be parents because they are more likely to sexually abuse children, to engage in promiscuous sexual conduct that puts their children at risk for premature and inappropriate sexual behavior, and to have unstable families due to relationship infidelity.37 To assess the validity of the claim that the denial of marriage or parenting rights to same-sex couples serves the goal of promoting the welfare of children, I will review and critique social science research relevant to these five concerns.  In particular, I will focus on research relevant to whether growing up in a lesbigay household is as positive an experience for children as growing up in a heterosexual household, since most of the commentary to date has addressed the issue of whether lesbigay parenting is psychological harmful to children.  Indeed, the extant research permits the conclusion that lesbigay parenting is not psychologically harmful to children. Yet, the research on lesbigay parenting has methodological limitations, and some research suggests that dual-gender parenting may be modestly advantageous for children. Given this state of affairs, laws prohibiting same-sex marriage on the theory that lesbigay parenting disadvantages children can (and probably should) pass constitutional muster under the highly deferential rational basis test for judicial review of legislative action. But as a matter of public policy, the research fails to support the theory that denying marriage or parenting rights to same-sex couples serves the welfare of children.  First, research suggests that children raised by lesbigay parents may be more likely to develop a homosexual orientation, but this should not and cannot be viewed as a negative outcome.  Second, children raised by lesbigay parents frequently report concerns about peer rejection if friends find out that their parents are gay or lesbian, and many times they go to considerable lengths to keep this a secret.  Yet, this stressor is likely not so different in magnitude from the many other peer-related stressors commonly experienced by adolescents, and research shows that the children of lesbigay parents have normal peer relationships.  Third, gays and lesbians have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse than the general population, perhaps in part due to the effects of stigma and prejudice.  But most gays and lesbians do not have mental health or substance abuse problems.  Gays and lesbians also   34. See Patterson & Redding, supra note 3, at 36–38.  35. Id.  36. See id. at 37–38.  37. See id. at 36, 38; Wardle, supra note 6, at 518, 520–28. 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM 134 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 15:127 2008 have higher rates of promiscuity and infidelity.  Yet, the legalization of same-sex marriage, and particularly childrearing in the context of these committed relationships, would promote fidelity in lesbigay relationships.  Fourth, the extant research suggests that mothers and fathers each make a unique contribution to children’s social, emotional, and intellectual development, though the relative advantages of dual-gender parenting appear to be modest.  Thus, a two-parent mother and father family may be the best family structure for childrearing, but the law has never required that parents conform to a perfect model of family life.  If this were the case, the state would deny marriage licenses to a substantial minority of heterosexual couples, a substantial number of whom have unplanned or unwanted children. After proposing new directions for future research on lesbigay parenting, I will conclude by suggesting that public opposition to gay marriage, particularly in the context of lesbigay parenting, is animated in large part by a deeper concern – the proverbial “elephant in the room” on gay rights issues.  That elephant is the visceral disgust reaction that many Americans feel toward homosexual sex, particularly gay anal sex, and the accompanying moral intuition that homosexuality and homosexual relationships are immoral.  Thus, regardless of what the research may otherwise show about the effects of lesbigay parenting on children, many people will conclude that it is better for children to be raised in heterosexual households because they do not want children exposed to the lesbigay “lifestyle,” nor do they want to increase the “risk” that children will develop a homosexual orientation if they are raised by lesbigay parents.  The article concludes with a discussion of emerging psychological research on moral decision making, which suggests that the emotion of disgust (an emotion that evolved to protect the body from contamination and disease) that many feel towards homosexual behavior is at the root of anti-gay attitudes on policy questions surrounding gay parenting and marriage. Recent research demonstrates the powerful role that disgust plays in the moral judgments people make about sexual behavior and the fact that such judgments are often based more on emotion than rational analysis. I argue that the disgust reaction is likely a byproduct of human evolution that fails to inform rational judgments about the moral rightness or wrongness of homosexuality, much less the public policy questions surrounding lesbigay parenting and marriage rights. I. THE STATE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH ON LESBIGAY PARENTING Because the existing psychological literature uniformly agrees that children raised by lesbians are as psychologically healthy as children raised by heterosexual parents, courts influenced solely by this literature would have to agree that raising a child in a lesbian-mother family is not against a child’s best interests.38   38.

Early Research Returns: “No Differences” Between Children Raised by Lesbigay Versus Heterosexual Parents Social scientists and mental health professionals have conducted over fifty studies, of varying quality, to examine the effects of lesbigay parenting on children.  In many cases, the investigators undertook the research to inform, if not directly influence, legal policy.  They have concluded that the findings “are exceptionally clear,”39 and demonstrate that there are no relevant differences in outcomes between children raised by heterosexual versus homosexual parents and that lesbigay parenting has no negative effects on children.40  Children raised by lesbigay parents do not have disturbances in gender identity, they have normal peer relationships, their mental health and psychosocial   39.

Advocates have used these research conclusions to bolster support for lesbigay parenting and marriage rights, and the research is now frequently cited in public policy debates and judicial opinions.44 B. Critics Take a Fresh Look at the Research: Fatally Flawed or Flawed But Informative? We must . . . assume that the Legislature would be aware of the many critiques of the methodologies used in virtually all of the comparative studies of children raised in these different environments, cautioning that the sampling populations are not representative, that the observation periods are too limited in time, that the empirical data are unreliable, and that the hypotheses are too infused with political or agenda driven bias.45 [A]lmost everyone agrees that the research has substantial limitations, whether the critics are pro-gay or anti-gay.  Nevertheless, the research continues to be trusted to provide serious answers.  It is quite remarkable how many authors note the limitations quite fairly and then ignore those weaknesses in order to draw relatively firm conclusions . . . the researchers tend to see what they want to see and once they have found it, they quit, rather than trying to test their results from an oppositional perspective.46 As Professors Stacey and Biblarz observe, “contemporary scholarship on the effects of parental sexual orientation on children’s development is rarely critical of lesbigay parenthood.  Few respectable scholars today oppose such parenting.”47  Challenging the social science conclusion that there are no   41. See AM. PSYCHOL. supra note 40, at 12.  42.

Increasingly, it seems that the courts, while once presuming that gays and lesbians were unfit parents, now concur with the social scientists.  In recent cases, judges have characterized arguments against lesbigay adoption as “the purest form of irrationality,” “ridiculous,” reflective of “virulent homophobia,” “nothing less than appalling,” 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM  IT’S REALLY ABOUT SEX 137 differences between children raised in lesbigay versus heterosexual households “has been a bit of a David and Goliath situation, and the Davids have not fared so well in the published scholarly analysis.”48 Perhaps this is partly because the psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers conducting the research are members of professional disciplines where the majority is politically liberal.49  Most of the researchers favor lesbigay parenting and marriage rights.  Many are also gay or lesbian50 and likely have a personal stake in the outcome of the research.51 This raises the concern in some quarters that unconscious biases may have affected their research, or at least, how they interpreted the results of their research studies.52 Recently, a few (mostly) conservative social scientists and legal scholars have questioned the validity and reliability of this research and the “no difference” conclusion.53  As Professor Wardle concludes, “the social science evidence is very important, [but] thus far that evidence has been immature, biased, and unreliable.

With one exception, the five more recent critiques have appeared in low-prestige psychology journals, in the law reviews of conservative, religiously-affiliated law schools, or in a book sponsored and published by a conservative organization.  Therefore, they may not receive the attention they deserve from policymakers much less social scientists. Indeed, the critiques have received scant attention in the scholarly literature,57  though they have been cited in several recent court opinions.58 As discussed in Section II (infra), this research suggests possible differences in outcomes between children raised in homosexual as compared to heterosexual households. The most detailed and persuasive methodological critique was provided by the quantitative sociologists Robert Lerner and Althea Nagai in their 2001 book, No Basis: What the Studies Don’t Tell Us About Same-Sex Parenting,59 which reviews the methodology and statistical analysis used in the forty-nine empirical studies of lesbigay parenting.  They concluded that the studies are deeply flawed, and “offer no basis for that conclusion.”60  Although researchers have made the case that “it is not the results obtained from any one specific sample but the accumulation of findings from many different samples that will be most meaningful,” Lerner and Nagai retort that even when taken as a whole, the research is too unreliable to meaningfully inform public policy.61  None of the forty-eight studies fully satisfied the key methodological criteria required for strong validity and reliability: a heterosexual control group, adequate control for extraneous variables, reliable measures, use of a random or probability sample, appropriate statistical analyses, and adequate sample size and statistical power.62 The most significant and widely acknowledged limitation is the small size of the samples used in the studies. Most studies typically include only fifteen to fifty participants per comparison group, which results in insufficient statistical “power” to detect small or moderate differences in outcomes between children raised by heterosexual versus lesbigay parents.63 Lerner and Nagai estimate that the probability of finding a false negative (i.e., failing to find true existing  children than would likely have been provided by heterosexual households”).

Several of the more recent studies had sample sizes large enough to detect large differences, and some were powerful enough to detect even moderate differences.66  But many of the important discoveries found in psychological research involve relatively modest effects.67 The second major limitation concerns the use of non-representative, self-selected samples of convenience rather than random samples, making it difficult to generalize the findings to the larger lesbigay or heterosexual populations.  According to Cameron, “[i]t is always difficult to judge the relevance of findings from studies utilizing volunteer samples. . . .  They look ‘real’ in that they have methods, statistical treatments, and report results, but unlike studies based on random samples, their findings can not be used to generalize to any population . . . .”68  Most of the lesbigay participants in these studies were white, middle- and upper-middle class, professional parents living in politically liberal urban areas (e.g., the San Francisco Bay area),69 while most of the single-parent heterosexual participants were “draw[n] heavily from [populations] that seem extremely unrepresentative of single parents.”70  The lesbigay participants in many of the studies had family incomes and educational levels higher than the   64. Statisticians call this a “type II error” – i.e., failing to reject the null hypothesis when true differences exist. For more information on type II errors, see ARTHUR ARON, ELAINE N. ARON, & ELLIOT COUPS, STATISTICS FOR PSYCHOLOGY  (4th ed. 2008).  65. See LERNER & NAGAI, supra note 28, at 103.  On the other hand, enough studies have been conducted that, from a statistical standpoint, at least several should have detected even small differences, if such differences truly exist.  With an alpha value set at the conventional .05 level for statistical significance, one would expect five percent of the studies to have found statistically significant differences just by chance.  66. The “effect size” refers to the degree of effect or difference detected, and the ability to detect effects increases with the sample size, which increases the statistical “power” of the study.  “Consider the relation of power to a nonsignificant result.  Suppose you did not get a significant result and the power of the study was low.  In this situation, the study is entirely inconclusive.  Not getting a significant result may have been because the research hypothesis was false.  Or, it may have been because the study had too little power (for example, having too few participants).”  ARTHUR ARON, ELAINE N. ARON, & ELLIOT COUPS, supra note 64 at 241. In social science research, effects sizes of less than .50 (accounting for less than 25% of the variance) are considered small, effect sizes between about .50 and .80 are considered to be moderate, and effects sizes of .80 (accounting for 64% of the variance) or greater are considered to be large.

These factors have been shown to be advantageous in childrearing.71  In addition, most participants were volunteers recruited through lesbigay organizations, advertisements in lesbigay publications, and/or through other study participants (“snowball sampling”),72 rather than through a random sampling of the lesbigay community.  Participants “are usually relatively open about their homosexuality and, therefore, may bias the research towards a particular group of gay and lesbian parents.”73  Moreover, participants usually knew what the studies were designed to investigate, leading to the possibility of conscious or unconscious biases that produce results favoring lesbigay parenting.74 Professors Rekers and Kilgus similarly argue that the confluent problems of small sample size and non-representative samples make the “no-difference” finding of most studies wholly unreliable: [W]hen a small sample is drawn in a non-representative fashion and no statistically significant difference is found between two groups . . . the persistent problem is that the findings from an unrepresentative sample have no demonstrated generalization to the larger population of homosexual parents and their children.  Additionally, there is the added possibility that even if the sample had been representative of the population, the study’s small sample size rendered it methodologically limited in being able to detect any actual differences that may exist in the large population studied.  Therefore, a finding of no difference between small, unrepresentative samples provides insufficient evidence to determine whether a group difference is present or not in the larger population of homosexual parents and their children compared to others.75 Furthermore, the studies variously suffer from a number of other methodological problems including: failure to control for important variables (parents’ educational level or socioeconomic status, parents’ living arrangements, amount of childrens’ contact with biological parents, single- versus dual-parent homosexual families, ex cetera); a lack of heterosexual control or matched groups; over-reliance on self-report; lack of longitudinal data; improper formulation and statistical testing of the “no difference” hypotheses;76 and measures that fail to distinguish adequately between sexual identity, behavior, and desire.77  Importantly, “visible lesbigay parenthood is such a recent phenomenon that most studies are necessarily of the children of a transitional generation of self-identified lesbians and gay men who became parents in the context of heterosexual relationships that dissolved before or after they assumed a gay identity.  These unique historical conditions make it impossible to fully distinguish the impact of a parent’s sexual orientation on a   71. Id.  72. Stacey & Biblarz, supra note 1, at 166.  73.

Consequently, it is difficult to disentangle the possible effects of parents’ sexual orientation from those relating to living in single-parent versus two-parent households.  “Because two parents have more resources (time, money, energy, etc.) than a single parent, finding no difference in child outcomes in such studies does not provide legitimate or valid data on the comparability of parenting by homosexuals to heterosexuals.”79 In addition, current research has not yet examined several important groups of lesbigay parents and their children.  Most studies include lesbian parents but few have included gay parents, and there are no studies specifically of adoptive parents.  Given the small sample sizes, the studies do not permit a statistically reliable examination of whether lesbigay parenting may affect boys and girls differently.  Most importantly, very few studies have included the adult children of lesbigay parents.  Most studies are of pre-adolescent or young adolescent children, although some outcomes of interest (such as sexual orientation) may not occur until late adolescence or adulthood.  Finally, no study has examined the custody preferences of the children of divorced lesbigay parents. C. The Importance of “Getting It Right” Many of the methodological limitations in the existing studies are not due to the negligence of the researchers, but rather, to the difficulty in recruiting participants for these kinds of studies.  “[I]t is still not safe for lesbians and gay men to be publicly ‘out’ about their sexuality, so a representative sample of lesbian and gay parents and their children probably constitutes an unattainable goal at present.”80  One common criticism is that the studies set out to prove a scientific impossibility – the “null hypothesis.”81  As Professor Williams explains, “[i]t is impossible for science to prove a negative . . . . It is, in principle, inadvisable to base important decisions on a body of nonaffects.  Absent findings do not aggregate.”82  It is a fundamental principle of statistical inference that unless one samples the entire population of interest (e.g., all children of lesbigay parents versus all children of heterosexual parents), a study cannot affirm the null hypothesis.  Scientific studies are designed to detect differences.  Yet, adherence to this principle would mean that research could never be used to support policies favoring lesbigay parenting because any “no difference” findings would be disregarded.  Although one can never prove the null hypothesis, an adequate number of methodologically sound studies finding no   78. Stacey & Biblarz, supra note 1, at 165.  79.

For a discussion of this statistical principle in the context of lesbigay parenting research, see LERNER & NAGAI, supra note 28, at 15–21; Rekers & Kilgus, supra note 55, at 368–70.  82. Williams, supra note 55, at 353. 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM  IT’S REALLY ABOUT SEX 143 differences should be sufficient to permit an inference – if only tentatively – that the null hypothesis is likely correct. But when considering fundamental changes in family law policies that may affect the welfare of children for generations to come, the importance of “getting it right” argues for setting a fairly demanding standard when relying on lesbigay parenting research in guiding public policy.  Studies should be designed so as to maximize the chances of detecting possible differences in outcomes between children raised by lesbigay versus heterosexual parents.83  “How sure we need to be before we accept a hypothesis will depend on how serious a mistake it would be” if we are wrong.84  In this regard, researchers as well as those making policy decisions must consider the ethical consequences of making a “type II error” (i.e., accepting the null hypothesis when it is false). At a minimum, researchers must be fully candid about the differences they do find.  Commentators note that some studies appear to report findings inaccurately or incompletely,85 leading some to question the biases or political motivations of the researchers.86  Seemingly some researchers, “disregard[ed] their own results”87 when they claimed that parents’ sexual orientation does not influence children’s sexual orientation.  For example, Professors Rekers and Kilgus notes that Green and colleagues “stated in the abstract of their article, [that] no significant differences were found between the two types of households for boys’ . . . but this contradicts the [many differences] reported in the body of the article.”88  Similarly, Tasker and Golombok concluded that lesbigay parents are no more likely to have gay sons or lesbian daughters than   83.

In the report of the research, little is made of this finding, and it does not dissuade the authors from concluding that there is no evidence of an effect of parents’ sexual orientation.  This oversight is difficult to explain, but is found in other studies as well.  Huggins, for example, found a difference in the variability of self-esteem (i.e., how spread out the children were along the self-esteem scale) between children of homosexual versus children of heterosexual parents.  However, she did not bother to test it for significance – although my analysis found the difference to be significant.  She chose not to comment on it further.  Patterson found, but left unreported, a similar difference; and Lewis, in a qualitative study, found evidence of emotional and social difficulties in the lives of children of homosexual parents, but the findings did not affect her conclusion that there were no effects”).  86.

[concluded]: ‘The commonly held assumption that lesbian mothers will have lesbian daughters and gay sons was not supported by the findings.’  But this is an illegitimate conclusion from their study . . . . The finding of 12% active homosexual adult children among daughters of homosexuals in this methodologically flawed exploratory study is at least three times the base rate of homosexuality in the adult female population . . .91 In another example, Tasker and Golombok concluded from their comparative study of twenty-five children of lesbian mothers and twenty-one children of heterosexual mothers that the children of lesbian mothers “were no more likely than their counterparts from heterosexual single-parent families to experience peer stigma [and teasing] during adolescence.”92  Although a technically accurate description of the study findings, the data show that thirty-six percent of the children of lesbian mothers experienced teasing as compared to only fourteen percent of the children of single heterosexual mothers.93  It is likely the difference is not statistically significant merely because of the small sample size. Had the same findings been obtained with a larger sample, they likely would have been statistically significant, requiring the conclusion that children of lesbian mothers are indeed more likely to be teased.  Moreover, even with the small sample size, the study did find a statistical trend indicating that the children of lesbian mothers were more likely to have been teased about their own sexuality.94 At the same time, allegations that researchers are biased in interpreting the literature to favor lesbigay parenting are overstated.  For example, Professor Schumm points out that “most reviewers . . . frequently overlooked an interesting article by Sotirios Sarantakos which, in contrast to most other research, used a relatively large sample of families.  However, that article, though a methodological improvement over much of the other research, happened to find several adverse outcomes associated with gay parenting.  It seems too convenient for such an important article to have been completely overlooked by virtually all of those who have reviewed the literature so thoroughly.”95  The Sarantakos   89.

Although the largely qualitative study is a methodological improvement in having a larger sample size (116 homosexual couples and 58 heterosexual couples), it is methodologically weaker insofar as the findings are based primarily on interviews with teachers who were not blind as to whether children came from heterosexual or homosexual households. D. Three Recent Studies Three recent studies rest on a much sounder methodological foundation than previous research and therefore merit a detailed discussion.  The sample sizes in these studies, while somewhat larger than those of previous studies, are also relatively small.  However, they drew their samples from large community studies in which participants were recruited randomly and not on the basis of sexual orientation, or from sperm-bank clients, which eliminated any confounding effects of a parent’s sexual orientation status with those of divorce.  These three studies also found that lesbigay parenting has no negative psychological effects on children A 2004 study by Wainright and colleagues compared the psychosocial adjustment and school outcomes among twelve- to eighteen-year-old children of forty-four same-sex couples and an equal number of heterosexual couples.96  Their data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (a large random sample of adolescents).  The study included adolescents (rather than young children) who were drawn from a randomly selected national sample, and the lesbigay and heterosexual parents were matched on relevant characteristics (e.g., child’s age and gender; parent’s age, income, ethnicity, and educational level).97  The study found no differences in children’s levels of depression, anxiety, or self-esteem as a function of family type.  There also were no differences in parental warmth, care from adults and peers, children’s autonomy, or children’s integration into their neighborhoods, nor were there any differences in the children’s GPA or difficulties experienced at school.  Adolescents in lesbigay households, however, were more connected to their school than those living in heterosexual households.98 A 2003 study by Professor Golombok and colleagues, which used mostly random sampling techniques to draw from a large community study of 14,000 mothers and children in the United Kingdom, compared thirty-nine single-parent lesbian families, sixty single-parent heterosexual mother-families, and seventy-four two-parent hetero-sexual families.99  The average age of the children was seven.  The study used a number of standard and reliable measures of parenting quality (warmth, conflict, supervision, and play with   96. Jennifer L. Wainright, Stephen T. Russell, & Charlotte J.

These measures were variously assessed via interviews with children, parents, and teachers.100  Although a number of differences were found between single-parent and two-parent families that generally favored the two-parent families, only several were found as a function of maternal sexual orientation and these differences favored the lesbian families.101 Finally in a 1998 study, Chan and colleagues generally found no differences in the family relations and psychosocial adjustment of the children of fifty-five families headed by lesbians as compared to twenty-five families headed by heterosexual parents.102  The average age of the children was seven and all had been conceived through the same California sperm bank.  No demographic differences between those who agreed to participate in the study and the larger population of families who used the sperm bank were found.103  The study utilized parent and teacher ratings of children’s behavioral adjustment and sampled systematically from a known larger population (sperm bank clients).104  There were, however, “differences between lesbian and heterosexual families in the study that favored the lesbian families,”105 since the lesbians tended to be older and to have higher income levels.106 II. DOES SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH ON LESBIGAY PARENTING  PROVIDE A BASIS FOR PROHIBITING LESBIGAY MARRIAGE OR ADOPTION? The extant research currently permits the conclusion that lesbigay parenting does not psychologically harm children.  A number of studies, including the three recent studies discussed above, have examined whether children raised by lesbigay parents are more likely to have mental health or psychosocial adjustment problems.  Despite the methodological limitations inherent in many of these studies (see supra), their findings are remarkably consistent given the vaying samples and research designs, thereby providing a degree of convergent validity. Of course, the finding that lesbigay parenting is not harmful psychologically to children does not resolve the policy debate over lesbigay parenting.  Most extant research on lesbigay parenting has focused on whether it harms children, not on whether growing up in a lesbigay household is as positive an experience for children as growing up in a heterosexual household.  Some argue that children do best when raised by a mother and a father, and arguments that children raised by lesbigay parents are more likely to be   100.

Such concerns reflect the view that lesbigay parenting is disadvantageous to children when compared to heterosexual parenting.  The next sections evaluate this claim against the relevant extant research and offer implications for public policy. A. Are Children Raised by Lesbigay Parents More Likely to Be Homosexual? Despite the claim that studies show no differences between children raised in lesbigay versus heterosexual households, as discussed supra, the studies have methodological limitations.  More importantly, they suggest differences in the sexual identity and sexual orientation of children raised in lesbigay versus heterosexual households.  The eminent parenting researcher Diana Baumrind noted that “[i]t would be surprising indeed if . . . children’s own sexual identities were unaffected by the sexual identities of their parents.”107  Professors Stacey and Biblarz similarly explain, “[o]nly a crude theory of cultural indoctrination that posited the absolute impotence of parents might predict [no differences] . . . . The burden of proof in the domain of gender and sexuality should rest with those who embrace the null hypothesis.”108 Especially informative is an analysis by Professors Stacey and Biblarz recently published in the prestigious journal, American Sociological Review.109  They reviewed twenty-one studies, selecting those studies that satisfied basic standards of sound methodology and included findings directly relevant to developmental outcomes in children.  They found that the limited extant research simply “does not support the ‘no differences’ claim” when it comes to sexual orientation and gender–role behavior:110 [T]he authors of all 21 studies almost uniformly claim to find no differences in measures of parenting or child outcomes.  In contrast, our careful scrutiny of the findings they report suggests that on some dimensions – particularly those related to gender and sexuality – the sexual orientation of parents matters somewhat more for their children than the researchers claimed . . .  Children with lesbigay parents appear less traditionally gender-typed and more likely to be open to homoerotic relationships . . . . [C]onsider, for example, the study by R. Green et al. (1986) that, by our count, finds at least 15 intriguing, statistically significant differences in gender behavior and preferences among children (4 among boys and 11 among girls) in lesbian and heterosexual single-mother homes. 111 Stacey and Biblarz’s analysis is consistent with the critique of Professors Rekers and Kilgus, who agree that the studies suggest differences between children   107.

Moreover, of those children reporting a same-sex attraction, none of the children of heterosexual mothers had experienced a homosexual relationship whereas sixty-seven percent of the children of lesbian mothers had experienced such a relationship – a sizeable, statistically significant difference.116  Sixty-four percent of the children of lesbian mothers had also considered the possibility of having a homosexual relationship compared to only seventeen percent of the children of heterosexual mothers.  Eight percent of the children (33% of the daughters and 0% of the sons) of lesbian mothers identified themselves as homosexual.117  Yet, Golombok and Tasker concluded that: [T]he commonly held assumption that children brought up by lesbian mothers will themselves grow up to be lesbian or gay is not supported by the findings of the study; the majority of children who grew up in lesbian families identified as heterosexual in adulthood, and there was no statistically significant difference between young adults from lesbian and heterosexual family backgrounds with respect to sexual orientation.118   112.

However, only two of the cited sources reported statistically significant differences in this regard . . . and both of those reports appear to have been derived from the same ongoing study.  Moreover, many of the differences reported in that study . . . can be considered healthy in a world in which gender-based discrimination persists”).  115.

First, the sample sizes were too small to yield statistically significant differences given the low base rates for homosexuality in the general population.  Second, although most of the children of lesbian mothers may not have self-identified as homosexual, many of them had experienced homoerotic attraction or homosexual relationships. Bailey et al’s. 1995 study is also unique because it examined the sexual orientation of the adult sons of gay fathers.119  The results indicated that nine percent of the sons were gay or bisexual, somewhat higher than the two- to five-percent rate of male homosexuality thought to exist in the general population.120  In addition, a 1996 study by Professor Sarantakos, which compared the school behavior (as reported by teachers) of 116 primary school children of homosexual couples (47 lesbian and 11 gay) with 58 children of married couples, found that “children of homosexual couples were described by teachers as more expressive, more effeminate (irrespective of their gender) and ‘more confused about their gender’ than children of heterosexual couples.”121  These results must be viewed with caution, however, as they are based on a qualitative study involving the reports of teachers who were not blind as to whether children came from heterosexual or homosexual households.122 Thus, the few available studies provide evidence that children (particularly girls) raised by lesbigay parents are more likely to experience homoerotic attraction, to engage in homosexual relationships, and to show gender non-conforming behaviors.  “Lesbian mothers tend to have a feminizing effect on their sons and a masculinizing effect on their daughters,”123 and such gender non-conforming behavior in childhood strongly predicts homosexuality in adulthood.124  Whether the parents’ attitudes and parenting behavior is responsible for the greater gender nonconformity among the children of lesbigay parents is unclear, but several studies indicate that lesbian mothers are less likely to care whether their children engage in gender-typical activities.125  Moreover, parents who do not conform to gender stereotypes would be likely to model such behavior to their children.   119.

Most young boys of lesbian mothers were reported to be more effeminate in their behavior and mannerisms than boys of heterosexual parents.  Compared to boys of heterosexual parents, they were reported to be more interested in toys, sport activities and games usually chosen by girls; they cried more often when under the same type of stressful situations; and they more often sought the advice of female teachers”).  122.

But recall the findings of the Tasker and Golombok study that of those children reporting a same-sex attraction, none of the children of heterosexual mothers had experienced a homosexual relationship whereas sixty-seven percent of the children of lesbian mothers had experienced such a relationship.129  The study also found reasonably strong correlations between children’s sexual orientation and their lesbian mothers’ openness in showing physical affection to their partner when their children were school age, the mother’s number of lesbian partners, and the mother’s openness to her children having homosexual relationships.130  (A recent study of lesbian mothers found that only twenty-one percent hoped that their child would be heterosexual while sixty-five percent did not care whether their child was heterosexual or homosexual.)131  Together, these findings suggest that children’s sexual orientation may be affected by a home environment that models and is accepting of homosexuality. Interestingly, an interview study of children whose mother had “come out” as a lesbian during their early adolescence, revealed that the children worried that they might become homosexual.132 Yet, as Sigmund Freud said years ago, “[h]omosexuality is assuredly no advantage but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation.  It cannot be classified as an illness.”133  Indeed, mental health professionals do not consider homosexuality to be a mental disorder or psychosocial problem of any kind.  Although the limited available research suggests that children raised in lesbigay households may be somewhat more likely to experience homoerotic attraction and homosexual relationships, this outcome should not be viewed as   126.

There is a strong scientific consensus that homosexuality is not a mental illness nor is it per se harmful.134  To be sure, many Americans morally disapprove of homosexuality.135 Yet, gay and lesbian Americans should not be deprived of parenting rights based merely on majoritarian moral views, absent any showing of demonstrable harm, particularly when those moral views may largely be an evolutionary byproduct of a psychology of disgust (an emotion that evolved to protect the body from contamination and disease) that fails to rationally inform modern-day policy judgments (see Section IV, infra).  Indeed, in Lawrence v. Texas,136 which struck down criminal sodomy statutes, the U.S. Supreme Court made clear that moral values alone, absent any showing of harm, cannot properly be the basis for legal prohibitions against homosexual conduct: [T]he Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral.  The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family.  For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives.  These considerations do not answer the question before us, however.  The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.  Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.137 B. Are Children Raised by Lesbigay Parents Likely to Have Difficulty with Peers? Studies have found that children (particularly boys) raised in homosexual households are more likely to be teased by peers – either about their parent’s sexual orientation or their own sexuality –  than children raised in heterosexual households.138  This is not surprising, given the strength and pervasiveness of   134. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its official list of mental disorders in 1973, and since that time, neither the American Psychiatric Association nor the American Psychological Association has considered it to be a mental disorder or psychological problem of any kind. See John J. Conger, Proceedings of the American Psychological Association, Incorporated, for the Year 1974, AM. PSYCHOLOGIST 620, 633 (1975) (stating that “[t]he American Psychological Association supports the action taken on December 15, 1973, by the American Psychiatric Association, removing homosexuality from that Association’s official list of mental disorders. The American Psychological Association therefore adopts the following resolution: Homosexuality, per se, implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities: Further, the American Psychological Association urges all mental health professionals to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientations”).  135.

For example, recent survey findings indicate that ninety percent of students had heard anti-gay epithets at school.139  The stigma of membership in a marginalized group often extends to family members, including one’s children: “[h]aving a relationship with a stigmatized individual may lead society to treat both individuals as members of the stigmatized group.”140  Even college students, presumably more open-minded and more mature than adolescents, reported that they would be less willing to be friends with the sons or daughters of lesbian.141  Surveying undergraduates at a midwestern university, Professor King found that they rated the children of lesbians as being stigmatized in society to the same degree as the children of an ex- convict parent, though most expressed a willingness to be friends with the children of lesbian mothers.142 A 1996 Australian study that asked teachers about the peer relations of fifty-eight primary school children of lesbigay parents reported: [T]hese children usually find it difficult to be fully accepted by their peers as boys or girls.  In many cases these children had been harassed or ridiculed by their peers for having a homosexual parent, for ‘being queer’ and even labeled as homosexuals themselves.  In certain cases, heterosexual parents advised their children not to associate with children of homosexuals, or gave instructions to teachers to keep their children as much as possible away from children of homosexual couples . . . . Teachers have reported that children who went through such experiences have suffered significantly in social and emotional terms.143 Yet despite the teasing commonly experienced by the children of lesbigay parents, these children also have normal peer relations and friendships.  Moreover, the degree of typical teasing does not appear to be extreme, and studies consistently find that children have not felt harassed or unduly stigmatized.144  Without question, however, the degree of prejudice and teasing children experience depends on the age of the child and the community environment in which he lives.  Thus, the finding that children have normal peer relationships may reflect the fact that many of the lesbigay parenting studies were conducted in socially liberal urban and suburban communities (e.g., the San Francisco Bay area).  The findings might be very different if such  (reviewing qualitative studies and narratives of the children of lesbigay parents that report the teasing, embarrassment, and discrimination experienced by the children of lesbigay parents).  139.

We don’t tell anybody, but people know.  And people tease, and people taunt.  No other teen I know has gay parents, and it causes a lot of hurt not being able to share some of my feelings.148 As one teenage boy explained: Growing up with lesbian moms wasn’t easy.  Some kids teased me and tried to beat me up.  They thought that I was gay just because my parents are . . . . Still, sometimes, I don’t tell people about my family.  It’s hard to bring girlfriends home because I don’t know how they will react.149 And as a lesbian mother said in an unsent letter to her daughter: I talked to you that night.  I explained that all gay meant was that I loved Suzie the way I used to love your dad.  It was a lie.  To you – and to me.  I really thought that was all it meant.  As it turned out, it also meant that the neighbors would throw trash in our yard, people would stare at us when we took walks in the evenings during the summer, the neighbor’s children would call us homos,   145. The South has the highest percentage of lesbigay couples raising children. See Pawelski et al., supra note 1, at 351.  146. National public opinion polls have consistently shown that opposition to gay rights and same-sex marriage is strongest among African-Americans and in the American South.  See Patrick Egan, Nathaniel Persily, & Kevin Wallsten, Gay Rights, Public Opinion and the Courts (unpublished manuscript, on file with author). For example, as the daughter of a lesbian mother recently wrote: “I can say with certainty that growing up in Mississippi influenced my ability to process the disclosure of my mother’s lesbianism.  For instance, there was not a large gay and lesbian community and there were only one or two lesbian households with children in my age group.  Thus, shared experience or discussion with others was scarce.  As a result, it took some before I felt comfortable within myself.”  Kirsten Lea Doolittle, Don’t Ask, You May Not Want to Know: Custody Preferences of Children of Gay and Lesbian Parents, 73 S. CAL.

Even so, a 1999 study of seventy-six adolescent children of gay mothers living in the San Francisco Bay area found that many perceived that they were stigmatized, and the study found a significant relationship between feeling stigmatized and lower self-esteem.151  A 1993 national study of children and adolescents of forty-eight gay couples, most of whom were openly gay, found that the children were much more closeted about their gay parents than the parents themselves.  Many kept their parents’ sexual orientation a secret (even from relatives), many felt that they lacked support from families and relatives in dealing with the issue, and one third said that they often felt isolated.152 A 1993 case study of eleven young men and women who learned that their mother was a lesbian when she came out after their parent’s divorce, reported that all felt a strong need to keep their mother’s lesbianism a secret from peers: The theme of losing friends and of being judged was expressed by each subject with a moderate to high degree of intensity . . . . One daughter said, ‘In high school, constantly, as soon as the subject changed to moms, you were on your toes about everything . . . . Secrecy, remaining silent, and overt lying were perceived to be an important aspect of relationship maintenance and were presented as problems . . . . Keeping secrets led to loneliness, particularly for the boys, although the intense need to talk to others was reported by everyone in this study.  While fear of disclosure was strong, the desire to be known was also profound.  Isolation was less problematic for those subjects who had contact with other children of lesbians, suggesting this is an important aspect of breaking the pattern of isolation . . . ‘closeting’ and ‘passing’ proved to be complicated both intrapsychically as well as socially.  Several subjects spoke about the conflict between feeling intensely loyal to their mothers versus the need for self-protection; a conflict that often resulted in feelings of shame.153 Being closeted about one’s family situation can be quite stressful, often producing feelings of shame, disloyalty, and anxiety.154  Continually keeping one’s identity closeted or “passing” (i.e., pretending that one’s parents are heterosexual) to conform to the dominant group identity can be psychologically harmful or stressful.155  As Professor Tasker explains, “One aspect that is common to lesbian and gay parents and their children is coping with the constant possibility of experiencing the effects of prejudice . . . . Fear of possible homophobia is [] a stressful experience . . . . The child, like his or her parents,   150.

Although this stressor is unique to children of lesbigay parents, it is probably not very different in magnitude from the many other peer-related stressors commonly experienced by adolescents, and research shows that the children of lesbigay parents have normal peer relationships.  Nonetheless, as the narratives of the children of lesbigay parents make clear,157 it would be a mistake to underestimate the significance of the psychological toll taken on these children as a result of teasing or bullying158 as well as the disruption in their lives caused by attempting to hide their parents’ sexual orientation.  For example, a recent study of the ten-year-old children of lesbian parents found that, despite the fact that many of the children attended schools providing “LGBT-affirmative educational environments,”159 forty-three percent of the children were teased about their mothers’ sexual orientation.  This made them feel “angry, upset, or sad,” and such experiences were correlated with symptoms of overall psychological distress.160 But  as the U. S. Supreme Court made clear in Palmore v. Sidoti161 (striking down laws prohibiting interracial marriage), societal prejudice cannot be a relevant consideration when deciding public policy, even when that prejudice extends to the children of parents who are members of stigmatized groups.  Accordingly, the reactions of others to a child’s lesbigay parent should not and cannot be grounds for the denial of parenting rights to gays and lesbians.162  “[G]ranting equal rights to nonheterosexual parents should not require . . .   156.

The question, however, is whether the reality of private biases and the possible injury they might inflict are permissible considerations for removal of an infant child from the custody of the natural mother.  We have little difficulty concluding that they are not.  The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them.

C. Does the Mental Health Status or Sexual Behavior of Lesbigay Parents Put Children At Risk? Some courts and commentators express the concern that gay and lesbian parents are more likely to have mental health problems164 that negatively affect their children’s well being.165  This concern likely reflects residues of the time when homosexuality was considered to be a mental illness.166  In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality as a diagnostic category for mental disorder from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the standard reference for psychiatric diagnosis.167  Although homosexuality is not a mental illness, research indicates that homosexual populations suffer from a higher prevalence rate of certain psychiatric disorders   163. Stacey & Biblarz, supra note 1, at 178.  164. See, e.g., Byrd, supra note 55, at 220–22 (discussing higher prevalence rate of mental health problems among lesbigay populations); Rekers, supra note 55, at 331–41 (stating that studies “generally find that the majority of homosexually-behaving adults have a psychiatric disorder while a majority of exclusively heterosexually-behaving adults do not have a psychiatric disorder”).  165. Parental mental illness can affect children in a variety of ways.  For example, research shows that maternal depression hinders cognitive and psychosocial development, and possibly even brain development in infancy and childhood, and that depressed mothers tend to have ineffective parenting skills and children who exhibit behavioral, emotional, and academic problems.  There also is a higher prevalence rate of psychopathology among children of depressed mothers.  See also Geraldine Dawson et al., Frontal Brain Electrical Activity in Infants of Depressed and Nondepressed Mothers: Relation to Variations in Infant Behavior, 11 DEV. & PSYCHOPATHOLOGY 589 (1999) (finding that infants of depressed mothers have diminished electrical activity in the left frontal lobe of the brain); Constance Hammen & Patricia A.

See Cameron, supra note 33, at 289 (stating that “[o]f the major sexual deviations, e.g., adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, folk psychology considers homosexuality unusually dangerous . . . . In common parlance, homosexual practitioners are considered and called ‘weird’ or ‘sick’ – the same concept has appeared in psychiatry in more sophisticated terms, e.g., ‘mentally ill,’ ‘emotionally troubled,’ or ‘diseased’”).  167.

This epidemiological finding has been replicated in several recent rigorous studies that used methodologies (e.g., study of twins with divergent sexual orientations; study of eighty percent of a birth cohort in New Zealand) designed to achieve more representative samples and to better control for extraneous variables.169  In 1985, a nationwide health survey of 1,925 lesbian women (most between the ages of 25-44), found “a distressingly high prevalence of life events and behaviors related to mental health problems . . . .  Twenty-one percent of the sample had thoughts about suicide sometimes or often, and 18% actually had tried to kill themselves . . . .  More than 68% of lesbians reported having had a range of mental health problems in the past, including long-term depression and sadness, constant anxiety and fear, and other mental health concerns.”170 Like other studies (see infra), the nationwide survey also found high rates of substance abuse among lesbians.171  The largest study to date is a 2001 national epidemiological study conducted in the Netherlands (probably the most accepting country in the world of gays and lesbians), which found that gays and lesbians had more mental and physical health problems than the general population.172 Three recent large-scale national studies in the United States are particularly informative.  They used large national data sets collected by U.S. federal agencies, and thereby avoided some of the sample selection biases of much previous research while allowing a comparison between demographically equivalent heterosexual and homosexual populations.173  In sum, these studies   168.

A 2003–2005 nationwide epidemiological study of 10,000 gay and bisexual men conducted by the Centers for Disease Control found that 42% had recently used drugs (77% had used marijuana, 37% cocaine, 29% ecstasy, 28% poppers (amyl nitrate), and 27% stimulants).177 A large Australian study conducted in the 1990’s found that twenty-five percent of lesbian and bisexual women had a history of injecting drug use,178 and a study of homosexual and bisexual men in the San Francisco/Berkeley area found that twelve percent had reported injecting drug use in the last six months.179  These data are roughly consistent with the findings of other recent smaller-scale studies180 finding “remarkably high rates” of lifetime drug use among homosexuals.181 But many of the studies used sampling methods that did not closely match the homosexual and heterosexual comparison groups on relevant demographic variables, and studies using better matching procedures, while still finding higher substance abuse rates in the homosexual population, find less significant disparities.182  For example, a 1980’s survey of 3,400 gays and  men experience greater than expected rates of depression, alcohol and drug use and psychiatric help-seeking”).  174.

Because such views are likely to be seen as politically incorrect, they are less commonly expressed than those discussed above.  However, they have been given new voice in several recent articles,190 including one by Professor Lynn Wardle,191 the best-known and most prolific legal scholar opposing lesbigay marriage and parenting rights.  Professor Wardle writes: [O]ne of the very serious flaws of the existing research is that it ignores and evades the “hard questions” about the effect of homosexual activity by residential parents (and/or their partners) upon children . . . . [T]he critical questions concern how the sexual practices of adults affect the children whom they are raising.  Researchers might look to the areas of child behavior that are most likely to be influenced by parental sexual behaviors – beginning with the sexual behaviors, interests, and identification of children – including premature or delayed sexual behavior, types of sexual behaviors, risky sexual behavior, sexual self-identification, fidelity in sexual relations, and promiscuity in sexual relations, to name a few.192 Professor Wardle emphasizes a recent Netherlands study showing that even gays with “steady partners” frequently have casual sex with other partners, engage in risky sexual behaviors, have high rates of HIV/AIDS infections, and that the “steady partnerships” do not last long and have very high rates of dissolution.  Wardle interprets the extant research as indicating that “[h]omosexual behavior among [gay male] youth is associated with suicidal behavior, prostitution, running away from home, substance abuse, HIV infection, highly promiscuous behavior with multiple sex partners, and premature sexual activity.”193  For Wardle, “[t]his data raises serious concerns about the welfare of children placed for adoption in homes of lesbians and gays.”194  In addition, Professor Wardle collects narrative accounts provided by children of lesbigay parents.  He selects narratives and custody cases that illustrate the instability of the parent’s homosexual relationships;195 the premature sexualization of children;196 the prevalence of child molestation by the parents’ lover;197 the high incidence of domestic violence and drug and alcohol abuse among lesbigay couples;198 the stress of living in the closet;199 “the risk of disease and death in the household . . . hastened by sexually-transmitted diseases common to gays and lesbians;”200 and, “the irresponsible neglect of the   190.

But does the empirical evidence support Professor Wardle’s claims?  First, the empirical evidence does not support the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.  Studies have found that homosexuals are no more likely to sexually abuse children than are heterosexuals.203  Second, there is a dearth of reliable comparative data on domestic violence rates in lesbigay and heterosexual relationships.  Studies have produced widely discrepant findings, in large part due to varying sample characteristics, time frames, and definitions and measures of perpetration and victimization.204  For example, studies have reported prevalence rates for physical violence between seventeen and fifty-two percent in lesbian relationships.205  However, the evidence tends to suggest that the prevalence of violence in lesbian relationships is equivalent, if not lower, than that found in heterosexual relationships.206  It is unclear whether there is a higher prevalence rate of violence in gay relationships.

Conversely, the finding that there are no differences in the psychological adjustment of children raised by lesbigay and heterosexual parents209 tends to undercut this claim, since parental neglect is linked to psychological maladjustment in children.210 The research does bear out several of Wardle’s concerns.

Professor Herek notes: [I]mportant differences have been observed between those who choose to marry and those who do not, with the former generally manifesting greater commitment [and] higher levels of relationship satisfaction . . . .  [The] research on different-sex couples routinely controls for self-selection into marriage by differentiating those who are married from, for example, unmarried cohabiting couples.  Because the vast majority of U.S. same-sex couples lack legal marriage as an option, a comparable distinction cannot be made when studying them.  As a result, many research samples of same-sex couples have been more heterogeneous than samples of heterosexual couples . . . This greater heterogeneity might be expected to produce findings that overstate the extent of dissimilarities between same-sex and different-sex couples because observed differences might be attributed to sexual orientation when in fact they are due to other factors, such as marital status.214 Moreover, about half of adult gays and lesbians report being in a committed relationship, many of which have lasted for at least ten years.215 But there seems to be little dispute in the research literature that the rates of nonmonogamy in gay and lesbian partnerships are higher than in heterosexual unmarried partnerships,216 and that gay men have on average a substantially greater number of sexual partners over their lifetime than do heterosexuals.  Commenting on their landmark 1980’s longitudinal study of 156 long-term gay couples, which found that “[o]nly seven couples have a totally exclusive sexual relationship,” McWhirter and Mattison observed that “sexual exclusivity among these couples is infrequent, yet their expectations of fidelity are high.  Fidelity is not defined in terms of sexual behavior but rather by their emotional commitment to each other . . . . Many of the couples have started their relationship with either explicit agreements or implicit assumptions about sexual exclusivity, which they have modified over time, finding emotional   213.

Thus, gays and lesbians have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse than the general population, perhaps in part due to the effects of stigma and prejudice.  In any case, epidemiological studies identify a number of population groups that have increased prevalence rates of particular mental and physical disorders220 or relationship infidelity;221 yet, we do not deny parenting or marriage rights to these groups on this basis. But as one commentator notes, “[t]he basic issue . . . is not whether some or many homosexuals can be found to be neurotically disturbed.  In a society like ours where homosexuals are uniformly treated with disparagement or contempt—to say nothing of outright hostility—it would be surprising indeed if substantial numbers of them did not suffer from an impaired self-image and some degree of unhappiness with their stigmatized status.”222  Most gays and lesbians, however, do not have mental health or substance abuse problems.223  And while gays have higher rates of promiscuity and relationship infidelity than do heterosexuals, it is unlikely that this would be equally true for homosexual couples who were parenting in the context of marriage or civil unions.  Recent data, for instance, indicates that forty-one percent of lesbigay parents raising children have been together for five years or longer as compared to only twenty percent of heterosexual unmarried couples.224  The normalization of lesbigay relationships through the legalization of same-sex marriage, and particularly childrearing in the context of these committed relationships would likely promote fidelity in   217.

Do Children Need a Mother and a Father (and Two Biological Parents)? One of the most difficult questions to answer is whether dual-gender parenting (parenting by a father and a mother) is more optimal for child development than same-gender parenting.  As Hernandez notes, The Legislature could rationally believe that it is better, other things being equal, for children to grow up with both a mother and a father.  Intuition and experience suggest that a child benefits from having before his or her eyes, every day, living models of what both a man and a woman are like.  It is obvious that there are exceptions to this general rule—some children who never know their fathers, or their mothers, do far better than some who grow up with parents of both sexes—but the legislature could find that the general rule will usually hold.229 Similarly, as Goodridge notes: [It is] rational to posit that the child himself might invoke gender as a justification for the view that neither of his parents “understands” him, or that they “don’t know what he is going through,” particularly if his disagreement or dissatisfaction involves some issue pertaining to sex.  Given that same-sex couples raising children are a very recent phenomenon, the ramifications of an adolescent child’s having two parents but not one of his or her own gender have yet to be fully realized.230 Although the issue is not often addressed by advocates of lesbigay parenting, the opponents of lesbigay parenting frequently express arguments in support of dual-gender parenting.  Specifically, opponents claim that dual gender parents provide the ideal family structure for children because mothers and fathers   225. But cf. Timothy J.

The research on this question is unclear and difficult to interpret, particularly when considering whether there is something unique and important about paternal nurturance.  This question also broaches the issue of whether a two-parent lesbian family or two-parent heterosexual family is better for a child.234 On the other side of the debate sit the self-described “deconstructionists” of traditional family structure.  In their celebrated article, “Deconstructing the Essential Father,” Professors Silverstein and Auerbach claim that fathers do not contribute anything importantly unique or essential to childrearing.235  They argue that mothers and fathers socialize children in much the same way.236  To them, there is nothing essential about the presence of a male role model in the home of a boy.237  Studies purporting to show that father-absence produces negative outcomes are often confounded with other factors (such as low socioeconomic status) that correlate with father-absence.238  In sum, the deconstructionists argue that it is not family structure that matters, but rather, parenting skills and nurturance.239 Clearly, research shows that children do best when raised in two-parent families as opposed to single-parent families.240  The research on this point is so   231.

It may be, however, that what matters is having two parents, not necessarily a mother and a father.  Noting that “[c]laims that children need both a mother and a father . . . rely on studies that conflate the gender of parents with other family structure variables,”241 Professors Stacey and Biblarz reviewed eighty studies that compared child outcomes in single-mother versus single-father families or two-parent families with same-sex parent families.  They found no differences between a child’s psychosocial adjustment and social success in two-lesbian parent families and mother-father parent families, and that any differences in parenting skills tended to favor women over men.242  A recent study that directly compared two-parent lesbian families, two-parent heterosexual families, and heterosexual single-mother families243 found a number of differences between the two-parent versus single-parent families in relation to children’s socio-emotional development, parenting stress levels, and the degree of mothers’ warmth with the child.  Most of the differences favored the two-parent families.244  There were, however, virtually no differences between two-parent lesbian and two-parent heterosexual families.245  Similarly, other research has found that children raised by a mother and father and children raised by a mother and grandmother have equivalent outcomes in terms of their psychosocial adjustment.246 Nonetheless, the parenting styles of mothers and fathers may be complementary in ways important for child development: A growing body of research indicates that fathers may supplement what the mother offers . . . by teaching, modeling, or mentoring in ways that may not necessarily be part of the mother’s repertoire of skills.  Thus, it seems that parents can complement one another, modeling different sorts of behaviors.247 The differences in how mothers and fathers parent appear to matter;248 positive father-child interactions contribute uniquely to children’s social, emotional, and intellectual development.249  bodies of data in which the weight of the evidence is so decisively on one side of the issue: on the whole, for children, two-parent families are preferable to single-parent and stepfamilies”).  241.

When playing with the child, “mothers function as distress regulators and fathers as challenging but reassuring play partners.”251  Moreover, father’s play with children is more physical, unpredictable, and challenging252 a kind of apprenticeship for the child (“come on, let me show you how”).253 “Because these types of play elicit more positive responses from infants, young children prefer to play with their fathers when they have a choice.”254  Father involvement is also related to children’s early cognitive-motivational and linguistic development.255  Due to the fact that fathers use more complex sentences, imperatives, and attention-getting utterances than mothers do, they may make a unique contribution to children’s early language development.256 Second, father-child interaction also promotes children’s social competence and later popularity with peers.257 Conversely, children raised without fathers are more likely to have deficiencies in peer relationships.258  Research suggests that the father’s role in promoting positive peer relationships is multifaceted.  Fathers teach children how to manage their emotions, the father-child bond leads to the child’s development of appropriate cognitive-representational models of relationships, fathers play a unique role as “advisors, social guides, and rule providers,” and, fathers help provide social opportunities for the child.259  As the National Academy of Sciences concluded, “[y]oung children who play regularly with their fathers seem to get along better with peers and display greater social confidence.  Attempts to understand the ‘active ingredient’ in fathers’ play that promotes peer competence have revealed that children learn critical lessons about how to recognize and deal with highly charged emotions in the context of playing with their fathers.”260  Positive father-child relationships also enhance children’s self-esteem.261 Third, social-learning and social-cognitive theories of child development suggest that the presence of a same-gender, as well as opposite-gender, parent is important to children’s conception of appropriate gender-role behavior and   250.

Studies have found a correlation between the level of fathers’ involvement and children’s later emotional well-being, happiness, life satisfaction, educational achievement, and psychosocial adjustment in young- and mid-adulthood.267  One of the most comprehensive and methodologically sophisticated studies to date is a twelve-year longitudinal study involving interviews of two thousand married heterosexual couples and their children (when the children were between the ages of 7 and 19, and again at ages 19 to 31).268  The study controlled for paternal and maternal characteristics and involvement in order to assess the independent effects of maternal and paternal involvement on different aspects of children’s well-being (educational attainment, kinship ties, friendships, life satisfaction, psychological distress, and self-esteem).269  Although considerable overlap was found between maternal and paternal effects, small, unique effects were found for mothers and fathers.  Mothers contributed somewhat more to children’s kinship ties and friendships, whereas fathers contributed somewhat more to children’s educational attainment, self-esteem, and psychological health.  Both seemed to contribute equally to children’s life satisfaction.270  Overall, “the results suggest that fathers are about as important as mothers in predicting children’s long-term   262.

Men typically emphasize play more than caretaking, and their play is more likely to involve a rough-and-tumble approach.  In attitude and behavior, mothers tend to be responsive and fathers firm; mothers stress emotional security and relationships, and fathers stress competition and risk taking; mothers typically express more concern for the child’s immediate well-being, while fathers express more concern for the child’s long-run autonomy and independence . . . The importance of these different approaches for the growing child should not be underestimated.  All children have the need for affiliation with others but also the drive to go off on their own, to be independent . . .They need a parent who says ‘strive, do better, challenge yourself,” along with one who comforts them when they fall short. . . .  [F]or both sexes the resolution and balancing of these forces is one of the key components of maturation and personal achievement.275 Notwithstanding the findings that paternal involvement produces beneficial effects, the magnitude of the positive effects is often modest. Moreover, a substantially smaller number of studies have failed to find any independent effects of paternal involvement on children’s well-being.276  In addition, studies of maternal and paternal involvement suffer from a number of methodological limitations277 (though some of the limitations actually may serve to underestimate the positive effects of fathers on children’s development).278  Many studies examine the effects of single-mother parenting, making it   271.

The clearest and strongest finding on the effects of fathers is that children (particularly boys) raised in father-absent homes are at greater risk for delinquency and other adolescent problem behaviors.281  Research suggests that this trend is particularly true amongst African-American boys.282  A recent study of 433 African-American boys between the ages of thirteen and seventeen found that the children raised in father-absent homes were substantially more likely to have been retained a grade in school, to have been suspended or truant from school, to have run away from home, and to have had contacts with the police.283  Studies have shown that children who exhibit aggressive behavior in school are eleven times more likely to live in father-absent homes,284  that paternal involvement in childhood and adolescence predicts boys’ police contacts and criminal records in young adulthood,285 and that the quality and quantity of paternal involvement indirectly affects adolescent substance abuse.286  Professor David Lykken summarizes the research findings well:   279.

More than two thirds of incarcerated delinquents, of high school dropouts, of teenage runaways, of abused or murdered babies, and of juvenile murderers were raised without their biological fathers . . . Nationally, about 70% of teenage girls who have out-of-wedlock babies were raised without fathers . . . [T]he risk for social pathologies ranging from delinquency to death is about seven times higher for youngsters raised without fathers.”287 A recent large-scale longitudinal study found that whether boys were raised in a single-parent versus two-parent home was the strongest predictor of incarceration in young adulthood, even after controlling for socioeconomic status, race, or place of residence.288  Forty-three percent of incarcerated adults were raised in single-parent homes, mostly without fathers.289 Yet, even with respect to the preventive effect of fathers in relation to delinquency and antisocial behavior, the “empirical evidence for the link between father absence and criminal behavior has been weak.”290  Most studies have been conducted with father-absent families, so it is difficult to know whether increased delinquency among children of single-mother families is due to the lack of an involved father or the lack of two parents (of whatever gender) in the home.  Moreover, research consistently shows that discipline, supervision and emotional availability are among the most critical factors in determining whether children will become involved in delinquency.291  When it comes to providing supervision and discipline, two parents are better than one.292  A single parent has less time to spend on such activities and lacks the support and mutual reinforcement that comes with having a second parent in the home.293 At least one study designed to disentangle the effects of having fathers versus two-parents in the household found that competent single mothers who used effective discipline practices “insulate[d] a child against criminogentic influences even in deteriorated neighborhoods.”294  Another study that   287.

In his book, Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them,299 Professor Garbarino underscores the importance of family, particularly fathers, in the emotional lives of violent boys, noting that many come from single-mother homes with no strong authority figure for the boy. As Professor Popenoe explains, “[t]hrough identification and imitation, sons learn from their fathers, as they cannot from their mothers, how to be a man.  Making the shift from boyhood to constructive manhood is one of life’s most difficult transitions . . . [boys] typically do this through identifying and bonding with their fathers.”300 Munroe and Munroe’s study of the impact of father absence in four different cultures found that boys raised in father-absent homes paid much greater attention to males in their immediate social environment than did boys in father-present homes, suggesting that the boys in father-absent homes were seeking attention from other males to compensate for the lack of father attention at home.301  Drawing on other empirical and theoretical work, they speculate about the impact of father absence on boys’ development: [B]oys without fathers in the home experience a form of “deprivation” that evokes female-like responses at earlier ages and hypermasculine behavior in the adolescent years . . . . [T]he father-present boy . . . forms a representation of the concept male on the basis of exposure to the multifaceted, sometimes contradictory characteristics displayed in the behavior of an actual father.  The father-absent boy, as a “novice” without this exposure, forms a representation of   295. See MCLANAHAN & SANDEFUR, supra note 28, at 109—11.    296. Joseph H.

Thus, for father-absent boys over a long period, a disproportionate attention to males—as found in the present sample—would promote construction of a prototypical image of the male role. According to Munroe and Munroe, this research shows that the father is a “critical element” in a boy’s appropriate sex-role development. 302 In addition, fathers model self-control and empathy for their sons, two key factors in preventing antisocial behavior.  Father involvement appears to be uniquely important in the development of empathy, at least according to one study which found that the level of father involvement was the single most important parenting factor determining empathy in adulthood, even when controlling for maternal factors (e.g., maternal inhibition of child’s aggression).303  These findings “fit with previous findings indicating that prosocial behaviors such as altruism and generosity in children were related to active involvement in child care by fathers.”304 Thus, it may be particularly important that lesbian parents provide male influences and role models for their boys.  Perhaps judges should consider, as just one of many factors, the possible impact of father absence when deciding whether to award custody of male children to two-parent lesbian versus heterosexual couples. However, these conclusions do not suggest that lesbian couples are less qualified to raise boys. Several studies have found that divorced lesbian mothers appear to take steps, more so than divorced heterosexual mothers, to ensure that their son has regular contact with their father and an adult male presence in their lives.305 Father figures also have positive effects on girls’ psychosocial development, particularly in reducing internalizing behaviors (e.g., depression, negative affect, and self-destructive behaviors).306  Girls with involved fathers have lower rates of promiscuity and teen pregnancy and a stronger sense of self-efficacy.307  As one commentator explains, fathers provide girls with a sense of security which may ultimately lead to healthier heterosexual relationships, more independence and self-determination. 308 In sum, although being raised by homosexual parents may not lead to negative outcomes in children (see Sections I-D & II, supra), the complementarily theory argues that children miss something of value by not having a mother and   302.

They provide male role models, accustoming their daughters to male-female relationships. . . . [and] [t]hey protect them, providing them with a sense of physical and emotional security.  Girls with adequate fathering are more able, as they grow older, to develop constructive heterosexual relationships based on trust and intimacy . . . they are more independent and self-possessed, more likely to assume responsibility for the consequences of their actions, and more likely to perceive themselves as masters of their own fate.  Id. 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM  IT’S REALLY ABOUT SEX 175 a father. Although it is difficult to draw strong conclusions in light of the methodological limitations of the studies,309  research suggests that mothers and fathers each make a unique contribution to children’s (particularly boys’) social, emotional, and intellectual development (though the relative advantages of dual-gender parenting appear to be modest).  Thus, everything else being equal, a two-parent mother and father family may well be the best family structure for childrearing. But rarely is everything else equal.  In any case, the law has never required that parents conform to a perfect model of family life—if this were the case, the state would deny marriage licenses to a substantial number of heterosexual couples.310  Moreover, [a] question at the core of fatherhood research is the criticality of fathers for children’s social development in light of the recent research evidence that children of lesbian families are socially well adjusted . . .  [and] there may be opportunities to experience both maternal and paternal interactive styles in same-gender households.311 In light of these realities, a lesbian household may not be any less adequate of a household than a household with a male presence. Furthermore, one partner in a same-sex couple may incorporate the opposite-sex behaviors into their parenting repertoire. Thus, existing studies on the effects of mothers and fathers, which have been conducted with single parents or heterosexual couples, may not shed light on what may be a fundamentally different dynamic with respect to same-sex parents. Importantly, research shows that among lesbigay couples, each partner tends to adopt both masculine and feminine roles,312 in part because gays and lesbians tend to be more androgynous than heterosexuals.313 Perhaps in same-sex relationships, one or both of the partners incorporates both maternal and paternal styles into their parenting repertoire. Yet, as Professor Baumrind’s study of the effects of parental androgyny on parenting behavior and children’s development suggests, such androgyny may not be beneficial in childrearing.314  First, androgynous men were more similar to androgynous women than to men in their childrearing style, which was a less effective style than that of non-androgynous men and women.  The androgynous parents were “loving and responsive, but not firm with their children,” and somewhat permissive in their exercise of parental authority.315  Thus, they exhibited what parenting researchers call the “permissive” parenting style rather than the “authoritative”   309.

Finally, related to the argument that children do best when raised by a mother and a father, opponents of lesbigay parenting and marriage claim that children do best when raised by two biological parents. Accordingly, lesbigay marriage “diminishes the social importance of children being raised by their own biological parents.”320  One commentator, for example, characterizes lesbigay parenting as “planned parentlessness” that “intentionally depriv[es] [the child] of one biological parent.”321  These opponents further emphasize the evolutionary importance of biology in childrearing.322  They point to research   316.

Most importantly, these arguments falsely assume that children raised by same sex couples would necessarily otherwise be raised by two biological parents. E. Are There Advantages to Lesbigay Parenting? Here, we consider whether lesbigay parenting may provide some uniquely positive experiences for children relative to heterosexual parenting.  Can gays and lesbians, in some ways, make better parents on average than heterosexual parents? One issue rarely discussed in the debate over lesbigay parenting is that far fewer, if any, births to lesbigay couples involve unplanned or unwanted children.  In the United States, fourteen percent of births to women fifteen to forty-four years of age in 2002 were unwanted, and twenty-one percent were unplanned.325  Research has consistently found that unplanned children are at higher risk for delinquency and criminality, at significantly greater risk for child abuse and neglect,326 so much so that researchers suggest that “programs which help families to improve their family planning skills may well be the very best strategy for preventing child abuse and neglect.”327  Mothers of unwanted children also have poorer relationships with their children.328   323.

Furthermore, children report feeling closer to their nonbiological lesbian mothers than they do to their biological fathers.331Thus, while some studies highlight the unique contributions of fathers in parenting, other studies suggest possible benefits in having two parents more skilled in typical caregiving activities. Finally, children raised by lesbigay parents are likely to better appreciate the value of human diversity.  A study involving eleven young adult children of lesbian mothers found the following: Sons and daughters repeatedly expressed concern at the lack of understanding about the substantial benefits of growing up with a mother who is lesbian.  Having experienced real or threatened stigmatization, these subjects reported an increased sensitivity to prejudice and a heightened ability to think critically about the impact of discrimination.  Their mothers were said to be role models of “bravery” and “risk taking,” which gave these children permission to think about their own differences in a flexible, positive way.  Like many children of oppressed groups, strength was developed out of adversity.332 The planned parenting of the child, the nurturing environment into which the child is received and the worldly perspective such difference can offer are only a few ways that children may benefit from lesbigay parenting.  The next section will discuss how these possible benefits should be examined in the future. III. DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH Future research on lesbigay parenting should shift the focus from the question of deficits—i.e., whether gay and lesbian parenting produces negative outcomes in children—to the question of positive outcomes.  This would be similar to the paradigm shift that has recently occurred in psychology toward a “positive psychology” that examines people’s strengths, not just their deficits.333  In addition to standard measures of psychopathology (e.g., of anxiety, depression), we need to use measures of life satisfaction and positive psychological adjustment, particularly since the standard measures of   329.

From this perspective, we can ask whether children are happier or more satisfied living in heterosexual or homosexual households.  Moreover, does living with homosexual parents —a stigmatized group in society—produce positive qualities in children such as tolerance and acceptance of diversity? Future research should also include qualitative longitudinal studies that obtain the childrens’ own perspective about their positive and negative experiences over time.  To date, only several such studies have been conducted involving a small number of children.334  We must listen to what the children say about their experiences living with lesbian parents, gay parents, and heterosexual parents.  By doing so, we will likely learn much that was not revealed through our standard measures of psychological adjustment.  Consider, for example, the findings of a recent study that examined the impact of father absence on the children of divorced parents: “In the eyes of young-adult children, their relationships with their nonresidential fathers are important in ways that seem obvious to them if not others . . . [This] underscores the importance of recognizing the limited coverage of many of the most commonly used measures of psychological adjustment.”335 The article by Kirsten Doolittle, Don’t Ask, You May Not Want to Know: Custody Preferences of Children of Gay and Lesbian Parents,336 serves as one such study into the effects of lesbigay parenting on children.  The author, the daughter of a lesbian mother, pulls together narrative accounts from a number of sources to paint a rich portrait of the common experiences and feelings of children who learn of a parent’s homosexuality following divorce.  Observing that “[i]t took some time before I felt comfortable within myself,”337 Doolittle says that the emotional toll taken on such children is “profound.”338 Although many children are outwardly supportive and protective of their gay or lesbian parent, they often simultaneously fear ridicule, feel ashamed, and question their own sexuality . . . . [The child] now will have to introduce the parent’s partner to friends, respond to taunts and jeers by peers, and negotiate her own homophobia with her love for her parent . . . Coming to terms with the revelation of a parent’s same sex orientation and the loss of privileges associated with having a heterosexual parent may take years . . . . Many children and adolescents react angrily because they fear that their parent’s gay or lesbian orientation will affect their own lives.  A common concern expressed by children in the interviews was that their parent’s same sex orientation would influence their own orientation . . . . they often attempt to limit the gay or lesbian parent’s behavior and to minimize the ways in which the parent’s gay or lesbian identity   334.

One wonders whether such feelings are exacerbated if the child resides with the homosexual parent, particularly if the parent is living with his or her partner. 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM 180 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 15:127 2008 will be disclosed . . . . One child, explaining his reasons for secrecy, said ‘Mom, it embarrasses me.  I’ve lost friends.  I don’t want to bring them home’ . . . . Once a parent discloses same sex orientation, the child’s reality is altered and the child suffers a significant loss.339 Doolittle posits that, in the context of divorce, a child’s acceptance of a parent’s homosexuality ultimately is achieved through a series of stages similar to the grieving process: “If children are given time and help in resolving the issues associated with [the stages of Denial, Anger, Bargaining for Secrecy, Sadness and Depression, and Acceptance], most will come to accept the parent’s gay or lesbian orientation.”340  If these stages exist, then perhaps we would find varying results depending upon when we assess children’s functioning  following a divorce.  This is another reason why we need longitudinal studies. IV. (IT’S REALLY ABOUT SEX): ATTITUDES TOWARD  LESBIGAY PARENTING AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DISGUST We talk about the weather. We talk about work. We talk about everything else. Except the elephant in the room.341 In response to the concerns expressed by the opponents of lesbigay marriage and parenting, this article has provided a comprehensive review and critique of the extant social science research on the effects of lesbigay parenting on children’s emotional, intellectual, psychosocial, and sexual development.  But these stated concerns may obscure a deeper source of the opposition to lesbigay marriage and parenting: moral and religious views of homosexuality as disgusting, immoral, and sinful.342  Social Science research, which demonstrates that lesbigay parenting does not negatively affect children, may be “outing” the opponents of same-sex marriage to reveal the underlying reasons for their opposition—reasons that the U.S. Supreme Court’s decisions in Lawrence v. Texas,343 Romer v. Evans,344 and Palmore v. Sidoti345 would suggest to be legally irrelevant. Public opposition to same-sex marriage, particularly in the context of lesbigay parenting, is often animated by a deeper concern—the proverbial   339. Id. at 690—94.  340. Id. at 695.  341.

That elephant is the visceral disgust reaction that many feel toward the sexual practices of gays and lesbians, particularly gay anal sex, and the resulting intuition that homosexuality is immoral.346  Thus, much of the concern revolves around sex and sexuality.  For example, Paul Cameron, a prominent anti-gay rights researcher and advocate, has argued that: Homosexual parents, as they raise their children, should have ample opportunity to socialize them into the parental image.  Further, such parents should fill their children’s environment with homosexuals and homosexual activities . . . . Because the homosexual parents’ life-style is disproportionately sex-oriented, the child’s lifespace may be hypersexualized through exposure to sexually oriented entertainment as well as exposure to the sexually tinged interaction of the parent and his associates.347 And, according to Professor Wardle, the leading legal scholar opposed to lesbigay parenting: One of the very serious flaws of the existing research is that it ignores and evades the ‘hard questions’ about the effect of homosexual activity by residential parents (and/or their partners) upon children . . . the critical questions concern how the sexual practices of adults affect the children whom they are raising.  Researchers might look to the areas of child behavior that are most likely to be influenced by parental sexual behaviors – beginning with the sexual behaviors, interests, and identification of children – including premature or delayed sexual behavior, types of sexual behaviors, risky sexual behaviors, sexual self-identification, fidelity in sexual relations, and promiscuity in sexual relations.348 Therefore, regardless of what the research may show about the effects of lesbigay parenting on children, many people will feel that it is better for children to be raised in heterosexual households because they do not want children exposed to homosexuality and “the gay lifestyle.” 349  Nor do they want to increase the “risk” that children will develop a homosexual orientation if they are raised by lesbigay parents. Clearly, many critics of lesbigay parenting view the development of a homosexual orientation as an undesirable outcome.350 Indeed, issues surrounding homosexuality stir strong emotion, so much so that they are frequently used as “wedge” issues in American political campaigns.351 Although public opinion polls over the last several decades show   346.

Republicans successfully used concerns about gay marriage to motivate voters in the 2004 presidential and congressional 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM 182 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 15:127 2008 favorable shifts in public attitudes toward gay rights,352 it remains the case that a large segment of the public has negative attitudes about homosexuality.  Professor Herek, a leading scholar on sexual orientation prejudice, notes that “Respondents to the ongoing American National Election Studies [“ANES”] have typically rated lesbians and gay men among the lowest of all groups on a 101-point feeling thermometer.”353  As Egan further emphasizes, “ANES respondents have consistently ranked gays and lesbians either last or next-to-last among all demographic groups in every administration of the survey since gays were first included in the battery of feeling thermometer questions in 1984.”354  According to the most recent polling data, sixty-three percent of Americans think that homosexual sex is “almost always or always wrong” (even thirty-eight percent of self-described liberals and fifty-two percent of Democrats think so),355 forty-five percent consider it to be an “unacceptable alternative lifestyle,” forty-three percent think that homosexual relations should be illegal, and forty-three percent would not allow a gay person to babysit their child.356  Between fifty-nine and sixty-six percent of the public does not consider a cohabiting gay or lesbian couple raising children to be “a family.”  About half  campaigns.  Some analysts believe that opposition to gay marriage was a part of the moral values vote that elected George W. Bush. See Debra Rosenberg & Karen Breslau, Winning the ‘Values’ Vote, NEWSWEEK, Nov. 15, 2004, at 23.  Sixteen percent of voters polled said that they would not vote for a candidate who did not share their views on gay marriage, and forty-nine percent said they would be less likely to support a presidential candidate who favored gay marriage. See AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, AEI STUDIES IN PUBLIC OPINION: ATTITUDES ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY AND GAY MARRIAGE 46 (1996), http://www.aei.org (summarizing national poll results) (last visited July 1, 2006).  Also in 2004 and 2006, the voters of eighteen states passed, usually with very substantial majorities (ranging from 52% to 81%), ballot measures prohibiting same-sex marriage. See Debra Rosenberg, Politics of the Altar: GOP Leaders are Putting Gay Marriage Back on the Agenda.  Will Voters Respond?, NEWSWEEK, June 12, 2006, at 34.  Same-sex marriage is now explicitly banned, either by statute or constitutional provision, in forty-four states.  See David Tuller, A Knottier Knot for Gay Couples, N.Y. TIMES, Nov. 12, 2006, at 2. On the federal level, Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) in 2006.  The Act prohibits the federal recognition of same-sex marriage and allows states to deny legal recognition to same-sex marriages granted in other states.  Moreover, in the last several years, though never passed, resolutions were introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives to amend the U.S. Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage in the United States by defining marriage as a male-female union. See Pawelski et al., supra note 1, at 356 (summarizing Congressional action on same-sex marriage).  352. See Herek, supra note 40, at 609 (discussing opinion poll results over the years).  353.

It is true, however, that a greater percentage of conservatives view homosexuality as being immoral than do liberals.  See AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, supra note 351, at 2–7 (summarizing the results of national polling data from, inter alia, the Gallup, ABC/Washington Post, CBS/NYT, L.A. Times, and Yankelovich/CNN polls.)  This is probably because conservative morality is more closely linked to the moral emotion of disgust than is liberal morality.  See Jonathan Haidt & Craig Joseph, Intuitive Ethics: How Innately Prepared Intuitions Generate Culturally Variable Virtues, DAEDALUS 55, 65 (Fall, 2004) (stating that conservatives have a “more finely honed and valued sense of disgust”); Jonathan Haidt & Matthew A.

During this time, boys regularly perform oral sex on older males . . . homosexual acts are considered a natural progression toward heterosexual behavior.”  Casual sex between heterosexual men is relatively common in certain countries (namely Brazil, Greece, Mexico, and Morocco).360  Homosexual sex between men and pubescent boys was common and accepted practice during certain periods in ancient Greece (though sex between adult men was usually frowned upon).361  But these are noteworthy exceptions—historical and cultural exceptions that prove the rule that homosexual behavior has generally been condemned across time and cultures:362  “[V]irtually all societies . . . discourage as predominant adult sex behavior anything but heterosexual intercourse.  Some societies permit homosexuality . . . and other nonmarital, nonreproductive behaviors for certain people at certain times of life, but nowhere for most adults most of the time.”363 Even today, many nations criminalize sodomy, an offense punishable by death in some countries;364 and gays and lesbians around the world are often subjected to private and state-sponsored harassment, torture, and degrading   357.

Evans).368  It included the stark claims that gays eat feces and drink blood.369 Disgust continues to play a prominent role in debates over gay rights. Disgust arises from the sense of bodily contamination, particularly when the body comes in contact with human or animal waste products (e.g., feces, urine, vomit, rotting flesh).  It evolved to prevent contact with biological vectors of disease transmission and to maintain the boundaries between our human and animal natures.370  “Disgust appears to function as a guardian of the body in all cultures, responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission (feces, vomit, rotting corpses, and animals whose habits associate them with such vectors) . . .

Noting “the profound moralization of the body and bodily activities such as . . . sex,”373  Professor Haidt explains that: [C]ulturally widespread concerns with purity and pollution can be traced to a purity module [in the human brain] evolved to deal with the adaptive challenges of life in a world full of dangerous microbes and parasites.  The proper domain of the purity module is the set of things that were associated with these dangers in our evolutionary history, things like rotting corpses, excrement, and scavenger animals.  Such things, and people who come into contact with them, trigger a fast, automatic feeling of disgust.  Over time, this purity module and its affective output have been elaborated by many cultures into sets of rules, sometimes quite elaborate, regulating a great many bodily functions and practices . . . Once norms were in place for such practices, violations of those norms produced negative affective flashes, that is, moral intuitions.374 In addition to religious beliefs (which themselves may have evolved from the “moral emotion” of disgust),375 the “moral emotion” of disgust may explain why public sentiments about homosexuality are so strong, negative, and pervasive.  Philosophers, psychologists, and evolutionary biologists theorize that the aversion to homosexuality is rooted in the human emotion of disgust, an emotion so basic that even twelve-month-old infants respond to the facial cues   371.

In addition to disgust, conservatives’ respect for authority and established gender roles (especially masculinity) and social hierarchies, see Haidt & Graham, supra note 371, at 105-08, 111—12 (2007), is likely another important component of conservative opposition to lesbigay marriage.  As Professor Haidt explains, “an important part of the opposition to homosexuality is grounded in the fact that most basic roles in society are organized around the dichotomies of male and female, father and mother, provider and nurturer.  Many cultural conservatives simply feel uneasy about alterations that go to the core of the existing social structure.  It gives rise to a certain kind of social angst, which gives them a sense of impending doom – that it is the beginning of the crumbling of the social order.”  E-mail from Jonathan Haidt to author (Jan. 29, 2007). 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM 186 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 15:127 2008 of disgust reactions in others more than they do almost any other emotion.376  “[F]ew [words] elicit such an innate, visceral response as disgust,”377 a strong human emotion having psychological as well as physiological components.378 Disgust has variously been defined to include “revulsion, repugnance, abhorrence, repulsion, antipathy, aversion, loathing, sicken, appall, and nauseate.”379 Research shows that feelings of disgust are frequently linked to sexual behavior,380 and that homosexuality is often perceived to be disgusting.381  Feelings of disgust result in a rejection of that which we find disgusting,382 as well as feelings of contempt and anger.  (Researchers refer to disgust, contempt, and anger as the “hostility triad,” since these emotions often co-occur.)383  Moreover, those who engage in what are perceived to be disgusting behaviors will themselves be seen as objects of disgust, warranting approbation.  In this way, contact with “those designated as interpersonally offensive . . . carr[ies] a degree of contamination threat.  Contamination in this case is not related to disease acquisition, but rather in acquiring the characteristics, behaviors, or qualities of the undesirable individual.”384 Thus, because they find it disgusting, many people will reject homosexuality and will not want children to be “contaminated” by lesbigay parents.385 Indeed, recent psychological research has   376.

Homosexual individuals may therefore be negatively evaluated due to heightened concerns over HIV contamination [most associated with gay anal sex] . . . ‘Homophobic disgust’ may then involve concerns about bodily products, such as blood and semen, and their potential for disease consequence.”388  Indeed, studies show that public attitudes are more negative toward gay men than toward lesbians, the difference being more pronounced among heterosexual men than women.389  As Professor Nussbaum observes: [T]he central locus of disgust in today’s United States [is] male loathing of the male homosexual.  Female homosexuals may be objects of fear, or moral indignation, or generalized anxiety, but they are less often objects of disgust.  Similarly, heterosexual females may feel negative emotions toward the male homosexual—fear, moral indignation, anxiety—but again, they rarely feel emotions of disgust.  What inspires disgust is typically the male thought of the male homosexual, imagined as anally penetrable.  The idea of semen and feces mixing together inside the body of a male is one of the most disgusting ideas imaginable—to males, for whom the idea of non-penetrability is a sacred boundary against stickiness, ooze, and death.  The presence of a homosexual male in the neighborhood inspires the thought that one might oneself lose one’s clean safeness, one might become the receptacle for those animal products.  Thus disgust is ultimately disgust at one’s own imagined penetrability and ooziness, and this is why the male homosexual is both regarded with disgust and viewed with fear as a predator who might make everyone else disgusting. The very look of such a male is itself contaminating—as we see in the extraordinary debates about showers in the military.  The gaze of a homosexual male is seen as contaminating because it says. “You can be penetrated.”  And this means that you can be made of feces and semen and blood, not clean plastic flesh.  (And this means: you will soon be dead.)390 Whether disgust properly forms the basis for making moral and public policy judgments in the modern world, however, has long been debated by philosophers, ethicists, and jurists.391  Some argue that there is moral wisdom in disgust.392  For example, Professor Leon Kass, Chairman of President Bush’s   386.

Id. 04__REDDING.DOC 5/27/2008  2:06:20 PM 188 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 15:127 2008 Commission on Bioethics, argues for “the wisdom of repugnance” in guiding public policy:393  “Revulsion is not an argument; and some of yesterday’s repugnances are today calmly accepted—though, one must add, not always for the better.  In crucial cases, however, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason’s power to fully articulate it.”394 But as Professor Nussbaum, the leading scholar on disgust and the law, observes: Although some disgust-reactions may have an evolutionary basis and thus may be broadly shared across societies, and although the more mediated types of disgust may be broadly shared within a society, that does not mean that disgust provides a disgusted person with a set of reasons that can be used for purposes of public persuasion . . . Disgust concerns thoughts of contamination as opposed to real harm; it is usually grounded on “magical thinking” rather than on real danger; and its root cause is our ambivalence to our mortality and animalistic qualities, namely to what we are (mortal animals).395 Recent experimental and theoretical work in social psychology and neuroscience (including brain imaging studies) makes a very compelling case that many moral judgments, including those relating to sexuality, are not the product of a deliberate, rational thought process that involves weighing and evaluating competing arguments.  Rather, such judgments are made intuitively, emotionally, rapidly, and largely outside of conscious awareness.396 These intuitive reactions, which arise from conditioned emotional responses to situations and stimuli, are provided with post-hoc rationalizations.397 Moral reasoning is “employed only to seek confirmation of preordained conclusions.”398 In an ingenious series of studies, Professor Haidt, the leading scholar on moral emotions, demonstrated the powerful role disgust plays in the moral judgments people make about sexual behavior as well as the fact that such judgments are often based far more on emotion than they are on rationality.  In one study, college undergraduates were presented with brief scenarios describing conduct that violates sexual norms, including homosexuality.  After reading each scenario, participants were asked a series of questions about, inter alia, how they felt about the conduct described, whether anyone was harmed by   393. See Leon R.

Our moral intuitions develop during childhood and adolescence as the result of external influences interacting with innate mental structures designed for moral perception; these global moral intuitions eventually become “hardwired” in the brain and guide subsequent judgments on particular moral issues. See HAIDT & JOSEPH, supra note 355, at 59–64 (explaining how moral intuitions develop).  397. Haidt, supra note 396, at 822–23.  398.

People frequently offered their emotional reactions (“affective condemnation”) as a justification for their condemnation of the conduct, but had “a confused inability to explain [their] position” (“moral dumbfounding”): This finding fits well with the qualitative finding that participants often condemned the scenarios instantly, and then seemed to search and stumble through sentences laces with pauses, “ums” and “I don’t knows,” before producing a statement about harm.  This general pattern of quick affective judgment and slow, awkward justification fits well with an intuitionist model of moral judgment, while it does not fit well with models in which moral reasoning drives moral judgment.400 For example, one participant gave the following explanation when asked about her condemnation of the gay anal sex scenario: “I don’t know, um [long pause], I guess, I don’t know, I just don’t really believe in premarital sex anyway, but, and obviously they’re not married so . . . .”401  Dumbfounding along with affective condemnation “are clear signs of emotion-driven judgment.”402  Many found the scenarios depicting gay male anal sex and lesbian oral sex to be “disgusting.”403  In fact, participants (conservatives as well as liberals) expressed on average more negative feelings toward these scenarios depicting homosexual conduct than they did toward those depicting consensual incest or a man masturbating “while his dog willingly licks his owner’s genitals.”404 In another experiment, participants were hypnotized and given hypnotic suggestions to feel disgust towards an arbitrary word (the word “take” or “often”).  After the hypnotic session, they read scenarios depicting various acts, and were asked to judge the moral wrongfulness of the act depicted.  Some of the scenarios included the arbitrary disgust word while others did not.405  Presence of the hypnotic disgust word in a scenario “caused participants to rate transgressions as more morally wrong . . . participants used their feelings of disgust (attached only to a word, not to the act in question) as information about the wrongness of the act.”406  But not only did it cause them to rate moral transgressions more harshly, it also caused them to feel disgust towards neutral conduct, including the following scenario: “Dan is a student council representative at his school.  This semester he is in charge of scheduling discussions about academic issues.  He [tried to take] [often picks] topics that   399. Haidt & Hersh, supra note 355, at 196–98.  400.

Rather than overrule their feelings about Dan, some participants launched an even more desperate search for external justification.  One participant wrote: “It just seems like he’s up to something” . . . Even when such tenuous justifications could not be found, several participants clung to their repugnance, choosing to abandon explanation altogether.408 Findings such as these “indicate that gut feelings can indeed influence moral judgments.  It also indicates that if there is ‘wisdom’ in disgust, this wisdom can be manipulated by extraneous factors such as hypnosis.”409 Indeed, although disgust is an innate human emotion that evolved to protect the body from contamination and disease, it is also a malleable emotion.410  “What is deemed to be disgusting and to be avoided varies considerably by culture, is perpetuated by societal norms, and is taught and modeled by individuals.  Growing evidence suggests that the social influences of disgust are more important in our development of avoidance and rejection tendencies than its evolutionary preparedness.”411  Disgust “[p]lays a special role among the major emotions in that it is . . . a major means of socialization,”412  and “[m]ost forms of disgust . . . involve learning that has associated the object with danger and contamination.”413  Such associations can be unlearned.  We tend not to be disgusted with practices and people with which we are familiar.414  Indeed, research shows that knowing gay and lesbian individuals substantially reduces anti-gay prejudice,415 which polls show to have been declining in recent years.416 In sum, the disgust reaction that many have towards homosexuality and homosexuals is likely a byproduct of human evolution that fails to inform   407.

As the smell of ammonia wafted into my nostrils, signalling [sic] to me a cleaning job well done, it suddenly occurred to me that the cleanser’s odor was every bit as pungent as that of urine, and that in fact the two odors were quite similar.  Different associations, however, had produced in me quite different initial reactions.  I then remembered how horrified I had been when, during my very first dog-walking outing, Biko stopped several times to sniff remembrances deposited in our path by others of his ilk.

Our moral disgust/indignation brain network is the source of prejudice, stereotyping, and sometimes outward aggression . . . History seems to bear this out. Women (especially menstruating ones), the mentally and physically disabled, and inter-racial sex have all been viewed with disgust, and are still viewed as such by some. But few people in liberal societies today would defend such attitudes and many have genuinely ceased to feel them. If disgust wasn’t a good moral indicator then, why should it be now?”421 Today, the emotion of disgust is being used to exclude gays and lesbians from enjoying the rights to marry and raise children – rights central to the imagination of virtually all Americans. CONCLUSION We now have a sufficient body of research to permit the conclusion that growing up in a lesbigay household does not cause psychological harm to children.  But that is different from concluding that growing up in a homosexual household is as positive an experience for children as is growing up in a heterosexual household.  Probably the most controversial issue is whether children benefit from having a mother and a father as opposed to same-sex parents.  A plausible reading of the research is that fathers and mothers each make a unique—though not essential—contribution to children’s social, emotional and intellectual development.  In particular, boys raised in father-  417. Although disgust is an evolutionary adaptation to protect us from harmful contamination, we no longer need to prohibit conduct that many find disgusting, because we know how otherwise to protect ourselves from disease.  For example, gay men can use condoms during anal sex to protect against disease transmission.  418. Dan Jones, The Depths of Disgust, 447 NATURE 768, 771 (2007).  419.

Given the methodological limitations of the existing research on lesbigay parenting, as well as research suggesting that dual-gender parenting may be modestly advantageous for children, laws prohibiting same-sex marriage or adoption on the theory that lesbigay parenting disadvantages children can (and probably should) pass constitutional muster under the highly deferential rational basis test for judicial review of legislative action: [T]he studies on their face do not establish beyond doubt that children fare equally well in same-sex and opposite-sex households . . .  More definitive results could hardly be expected, for until recently few children have been raised in same-sex households, and there has not been enough time to study the long-term results of such childrearing . . . In the absence of conclusive scientific evidence, the Legislature could rationally proceed on the common-sense premise that children will do best with a mother and father in the home.422 As a matter of sound public policy, however, the extant research fails to support the theory that denying marriage or parenting rights to same-sex couples serves the welfare of children.  Although children raised by lesbigay couples may be somewhat more likely to develop a homosexual orientation, such an outcome cannot be viewed as negative if, as a society, we respect pluralism and diversity.  Children’s concerns about peer rejection probably are not so different in magnitude from the many other peer-related stressors commonly experienced by adolescents, and research shows that the children of lesbigay parents have normal peer relationships.  In any event, the courts have made clear that prejudice against children whose parents are members of a stigmatized group is not a permissible consideration.  Most gays and lesbians do not have mental health or substance abuse problems, and although rates of infidelity are higher among gays and lesbians, the legalization of same-sex marriage and particularly childrearing in the context of these relationships is likely to promote fidelity in lesbigay relationships.  But dual-gender parenting may be modestly advantageous for children’s development, and one can well imagine why it is plausible to assume that most children would prefer to have a mother and a father.  Thus, a two-parent mother and father family may be the best family structure for childrearing, everything else being equal.  Yet rarely is everything else equal.  In any case, the law has never required that parents conform to a perfect model of family life, and there may be some unique advantages to lesbigay parenting. Why, then, do legislators persist so strongly in their efforts to limit lesbigay marriage and parenting rights in the face of research data demonstrating that children are not harmed when raised by lesbigay parents?  Research findings on outcomes will not override the moral emotion of many that homosexual behavior   422. Hernandez, 855 N.E. 2d at 8.  See also Anderson v. King County, supra note 30.

Thus, they do not want children exposed to a lesbigay “lifestyle.”  Nor do they want to increase the “risk” that they will develop a homosexual orientation if raised by lesbigay parents.  Opponents of gay marriage will continue to use these arguments as the bete noire in their brief against marriage and parenting rights for gay and lesbian Americans.
