Introduction“You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.”1 The mission of a public-school library is to “provid[e] services and resources to meet the diverse interests and informational needs of the communities they serve.”2 Unfortunately, this mission was interrupted in America’s schools during 2022 by a pre-cipitous increase in book bans in large part because of political advo-cacy groups’ heavy focus on banning books dealing with LGBTQ and race issues.3Part II of this Note will discuss the history of book banning, the vari-ous motivations behind the practice, and the recent data concerning the unprecedented rise in book bans. Next, Part II will explore the core values of First Amendment free speech and when restrictions on free speech may be permissible. Part II will then provide an over-view of the cases that laid the groundwork for the decision in Board of Education v. Pico. Finally, Part II will examine the Court’s reasons and rationales that led to its decision in Pico. Part III of this Note will analyze how circuit courts have used and interpreted Pico in their decisions. Next, Part III will argue that Pico is ineffective because it allows unconstitutional discrimination for book removals driven by the political whims of parents and advocacy groups. Finally, Part III will compare public-school libraries to social media plat-forms and propose a new framework governing book banning, which should be constructed by looking at the framework governing content moderation for social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook.1.

Finally, this Note will con-clude that a change in the legal landscape surrounding public school book bans is needed to control the rampant book banning stretching across the United States.II. BackgroundThis Part will explore the history of book banning in the United States. In addition, this Part will discuss general First Amendment free speech principles and examine the relevant precedent in conducting the First Amendment analysis for book banning. Next, this Part will exam-ine the key cases laying the foundation for book banning. Finally, this Part will recount Pico, the seminal case that provides the current legal framework for book banning in public-school libraries. A. The History of Book Banning“[A] student can literally explore the unknown and discover areas of interest and thought not covered by the prescribed curriculum . . . That student learns that a library is a place to test or expand upon ideas presented to him, in or out of the classroom.”4The destruction of (i.e., the functional equivalent of banning) books to protect against various ideas contained in them has been happen-ing since 212 B.C.5 The Chinese emperor, Shih Huang Ti, destroyed every book and record in his kingdom in an attempt to control his-tory and “thought history could be said to begin with him.”6 In 1650, a Massachusetts Bay colonist, William Pynchon’s The Meritorious Price of Redemption pamphlet was banned for containing ideas that contrasted with Puritan religious ideas.7 In the buildup to the American Civil War in the 1850s, states banned anti-slavery materials, including Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “a novel that aimed to expose the evils of slavery.”8 In the 1950’s, there were proposed bans of books that 4.

First Amendment Free Speech Principles1. Core PhilosophiesThe First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law .  .  . abridging the freedom of speech.”18 Central to understanding how the First Amendment applies to everyday life is recognizing the Supreme Court’s consistently held belief that the terms “abridging” and “the freedom of speech” are subject to interpretation, and that restric-tions on one’s freedom of speech may be permitted only for permissible reasons.19 When assessing the scope of the freedom of speech, the Court typically focuses on at least one of three rationales for the protection of free speech: (1) the marketplace of ideas; (2) self-governance; or (3) autonomy or individual self-fulfillment.20 The marketplace of ideas philosophy first entered into the Court’s jurisprudence in Abrams v. United States when Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated “that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.”21 Essentially, the marketplace of ideas protects the First Amendment freedom because it encourages all types of ideas and “creates a competitive environment in which good ideas flourish and bad ideas fail.”22 This philosophy still 16.

Joseph Blocher, Institutions in the Marketplace of Ideas, 57 Duke L.J. 821, 824 (2008).2023] POLITICAL ADVOCACY GROUPS 133plays an integral role in the Court’s decisions on First Amendment issues.23The self-governance rationale is most closely tied to Alexander Meiklejohn, who took the view “that self-government depends for its survival on a free and robust democratic dialogue.”24 Meiklejohn found that “[the] Constitution [ordains] that all authority [to] determine com-mon action, belong to ‘We, the People.’ [Under this system, free men are governed] by themselves.”25 Ultimately, the idea behind this theory is that no citizen should be denied the opportunity to espouse their views regarding public policy so that citizens may be as informed as possible to effectively participate in the political process.26 The self-fulfillment rationale is much broader than the previous ratio-nales and essentially finds that the communication of ideas between different people and listening to different ideas allows people to con-tinually learn, evolve, grow, and achieve self-fulfillment by becoming who and what they want to be.27 2. Restrictions on Free SpeechThere are three major restrictions to the First Amendment’s free speech principles; each restriction has a distinct standard of scrutiny that controls the analysis of constitutionality.28 First, are content-neutral restrictions, government restrictions on speech that can be “justified without reference to the content of . . . [such] speech.”29 In analyzing the constitutionality of a content-neutral restriction, the restriction must be “narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest,” and “leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.”30 For example, in McCullen v. Coakley, the Supreme Court analyzed the constitutionality of a Massachusetts statute that made “it a crime to knowingly stand on 23. See Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. Levy ex rel. B.L., 141 S.

[such] speech’” or were implemented in response to disagreement with the speech at issue.34 In analyzing the constitutionality of such a restriction, the government must satisfy strict scrutiny by proving that the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.35 For example, in Reed v. Town of Gilbert, the Supreme Court analyzed the constitutionality of a comprehensive signage law impos-ing different restrictions on signs between temporary directional signs and other types of signs for the purpose of aesthetic appeal and traffic safety.36 The Court held that the law was content-based because it could not be justified without reference to the content of the sign, and it did not pass strict scrutiny because the town failed to show that a restriction on temporary directional signs was necessary for aesthetic appeal and traffic safety.37Third, there are various categories of unprotected speech, partly because they are of so little value to society’s search for truth, demo-cratic self-governance, and self-expression that the benefit of protecting such speech cannot outweigh its cost to society.38In the book banning context, obscenity is the most relevant category of unprotected speech.39 The Supreme Court first decided that obscenity 31.

Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 765 (1982) (holding child pornography unprotected speech).39. “[T]here is a growing tendency to label material in schools as ‘obscene,’ ‘pornographic,’ and a corresponding push by politicians, parents, and administrators alike to use these labels as justification for the swift removals of books as well as circumvention of normal reconsideration processes.” Friedman & Johnson, Rising School Book Bans, supra note 11.2023] POLITICAL ADVOCACY GROUPS 135was unprotected by looking at the history of First Amendment jurispru-dence and finding “obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance.”40 Sixteen years later, in Miller v. California, the Court analyzed whether a mass mailing advertisement campaign consisting of brochures that showed people engaging in sexual activities and display-ing their genitals was obscene.41 In its holding, the Court developed the current test for whether speech can be prohibited as obscene:(a) whether ‘the average person, applying contemporary commu-nity standards’ would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.42 C. The Path to Book BanningIn 1967, the Supreme Court first recognized the classroom as a key forum of free expression.43 In Keyishian v. Board of Regents of University of New York, the Court considered a state plan that required teachers, like Keyishian, and faculty members to sign a certificate stating that they were not communists, and if they were, they had discussed that with the president of the university.44 Ultimately, the Court held the plan uncon-stitutionally vague and a violation of the First Amendment.45 While this case does not deal with book banning, the reasoning helped lay the path for the Court’s special treatment and view of schools.46 The Court found that, when the government seeks to restrict freedom of expression in the classroom, it may do so “only with narrow specificity.”47 In restricting 40.

Specifically, the Court noted:Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguard academic freedom, which is of transcen-dent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned. That freedom is there-fore a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom. ‘The vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.’ The classroom is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of ideas.’ The Nation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth ‘out a mul-titude of tongues (rather) than through any kind of authoritative selection.’Id. (internal citations omitted).47. Id. at 604. The court further stated, “Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. Teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise, our civilization will stagnate and die.” Id. at 603 (quoting Sweezy v. State of New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957)). 136 DEPAUL LAW REVIEW [Vol. 73:129a school’s ability to restrict free speech, the Supreme Court recognized that the exchange of diverse ideas is of the utmost importance, because “[t]he classroom is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of ideas.’”48 In recogniz-ing the value of exchanging ideas through academic freedom, the Court held that the First Amendment “does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.”49In Tinker v. Des Moines, the Supreme Court continued its path toward increasing protection of students’ constitutional rights to free-dom of speech while in public school.50 In Tinker, a group of students planned to protest the Vietnam War by wearing black armbands to their schools.51 The schools’ principals heard of the plan and subsequently adopted a policy prohibiting any student from wearing an armband to school, and if a student wore an armband to school, and refused to take it off, they would be suspended.52 Subsequently, the students wore the armbands to school, refused to take them off, and were suspended.53 At the outset of analyzing the constitutionality of the schools’ con-duct, Justice Abe Fortas famously said, “[i]t can hardly be argued that . . . students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”54 But Justice Fortas recognized the need “of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.”55 The Court ultimately held that, because there was no evidence “which might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities, and no disturbances or disorders on the school premises in fact occurred,” the schools’ conduct violated the students’ First Amendment right of expression of opinion.56 In reaching the holding, Justice Fortas explored and explained the student and school relationship: In our system, state-operated schools may not be enclaves of totali-tarianism. School officials do not possess absolute authority over their students. Students in school as well as out of school are “per-sons” under our Constitution. They are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect, just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the State. In our system, students may not 48.

They may not be confined to the expression of those sentiments that are officially approved. In the absence of a spe-cific showing of constitutionally valid reasons to regulate their speech, students are entitled to freedom of expression of their views.57Justice Fortas further explained that past precedent governing a stu-dent’s right to freedom of expression at school explains that this right extends to the accommodations that schools provide “students during prescribed hours for the purpose of certain types of activities,” like students talking to one another at recess or in the cafeteria.58 Thirteen years later, the Supreme Court wrestled with the extent of students’ First Amendment protections while students are in school.59D. Board of Education v. Pico – The Unclear Guide to Book BanningPico is the seminal case in the book-banning realm because it was the first, and so far the last, time the Supreme Court addressed the power of local public-school boards in utilizing their discretion to remove library books from public school libraries under the First Amendment.60 The Supreme Court was unable to achieve a majority to sign on to Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Court.61 Instead, the Court issued a plurality decision, the guidance of which remains unclear over forty years later.62In 1975, three members, including the President of the Board of Education of the Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 in Long Island, New York, took part in a conference sponsored by a politically conservative organization.63 At the conference, the board members 57.

AnalysisFirst, this Part analyzes how different circuit courts have interpreted the precedential value of Pico. Second, this Part argues and explains why Pico’s holding is insufficient. Third, this Part proposes a modern model for analyzing book bans that recognizes that the public-school libraries of today are similar to social media platforms. Thus, public school librar-ies should be afforded a similar level of immunity and insulation, for the 82. Id. at 869–70 (quoting W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943)). 83.

Finally, this Part discusses the vast impact Pico’s decision has had, and may con-tinue to have, on students, librarians, and the United States as a whole.A. The “Value” of Pico (To Some)“An initial problem raised by the Pico decision concerns the weight it is to be given as a precedent. Because a majority of justices did not concur in any one opinion, the authority of Pico is limited.”88 Both the Ninth and Eighth Circuits have found Justice Brennan’s plurality opinion to be of some precedential value in dealing with public school libraries and book banning.89 1. The Ninth CircuitIn the Ninth Circuit case Monteiro v. Tempe Union High School, a high school student was required to read two novels—The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and A Rose for Emily.90 Her parent sought the removal of the books from the student’s class curriculum, and all future classes, because of racially insensitive language.91 Although the court found Pico distinguishable, because this action was brought upon by a parent seeking to alter the curriculum, the court reasoned that Pico was “helpful in identifying the First Amendment interests that are involved in this case.”92 Additionally, the court identified Pico’s holding as stat-ing that “students’ First Amendment right of access to information is violated when schools remove books from library in content-based manner,”93 specifically, “in a narrowly partisan or political manner.”94 Here, the Ninth Circuit expressed the views of the plurality in Pico, and even though the Court in Pico was careful to forewarn that it was not deciding any issues pertaining to curriculum, this circuit still used Pico to identify the First Amendment issues.95 88.

The Eighth CircuitThe Eighth Circuit case Turkish Coalition of America, Inc. v. Bruininks involved a college student that wanted to use the plaintiff’s, the Turkish Coalition of America (TCA) website, which was part of a list on the college’s cultural center website called “Unreliable Websites” for a project.96 Afterwards, the plaintiff sent a demand to the college alleging the “Unreliable Websites” list containing plaintiff’s website and warn-ings to students against using it was a violation of the First Amendment.97 The professor, who was in charge of the college’s website, subsequently removed the “Unreliable Websites.”98 The plaintiff relied on Pico and argued “that the Center’s intent in warning students about the TCA website was to deny access to ideas with which the Center disagreed.”99 According to the court, Pico ruled that the First Amendment right to receive ideas “was violated if the school board members intended by their removal decision to deny [students] access to ideas with which [the school board] disagreed, and if this intent was the decisive fac-tor in [the] decision.”100 The Eighth Circuit quickly distinguished the plaintiff’s claim from Pico, reasoning that the students’ right to access the ideas in the books was only impaired when “the books actually were removed from the libraries.”101 Here, the court pointed to the absence of any facts in the record indicating the students were unable to access the plaintiffs’ website via a website, other than the college’s.1023. ConclusionThese Ninth and Eighth Circuit cases showcase the difference between what each court pulled from Pico as having precedential value.103 In Monteiro, the court’s invocation of Pico was very brief and was only used in part to inform the Ninth Circuit’s analysis in iden-tifying an issue that was not presented and that Justice Brennan spe-cifically disclaimed was not affected by his holding.104 Thus, Pico played a very minor role in the Ninth Circuit’s analysis, on a subject Justice Brennan specifically disclaimed was not affected by his holding without 96.

B. Pico Who?On the other hand, the Fifth, First, and Eleventh Circuits disagree with the above circuits about even minor and inconsequential uses of Pico, the precedential force or even clarity of Justice Brennan’s plural-ity holding in Pico, “and have recognized .  .  . that Pico didn’t resolve the issue.”107 These circuits are clear: Pico lacks precedential effect.108 Further, these cases, and those discussed above, illustrate the applica-tion, guidance, and precedential force of Pico are not clear to lower courts. As a result, many political advocacy groups have taken, and currently are still taking, advantage.1. The Fifth CircuitThe Fifth Circuit case Muir v. Alabama Educational Televi-sion Commission109 attempted to decipher Pico, but “conclude[d] that the Supreme Court decided neither the extent nor, indeed the existence . . . of First Amendment implications in a school book removal case.”110 Further, because there was no majority, and because the court found Justice White’s concurrence to be the narrowest for judgment, the court concluded “Pico is of no precedential value as to the applica-tion of the First Amendment to these issues.”111 105.

The First CircuitSimilarly, the First Circuit in Griswold v. Driscoll gave little prec-edential value to Justice Brennan’s plurality opinion from Pico.112 In Griswold, the First Circuit addressed whether the “removal of contra-genocide references from subtopic of Armenian genocide in board’s advisory curriculum guide” by the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education of Massachusetts violated the First Amendment rights of school members, parents, and the Assembly of Turkish American Associations.113 But, the First Circuit was unable to tell what issues pertaining to library censorship warranted special consideration and further stated: Pico’s rule of decision, however, remains unclear; three members of the plurality recognized and emphasized a student’s right to free enquiry in the library, but Justice Blackmun disclaimed any reliance on location and resorted to a more basic principle that a state may not discriminate among ideas for partisan or political reasons, and Justice White concurred in the judgment without announcing any position on the substantive First Amendment claim.114 The First Circuit held the curriculum guide was a part of the school curriculum, and thus, the Commissioner’s discretion was not violative of the First Amendment.115 In a footnote, the court expressed its hesi-tancy in applying Pico to the decision due to its imprecision.116 3. The Eleventh CircuitIn the Eleventh Circuit case ACLU of Florida, Inc. v. Miami-Dade School Board, the court stated that “[t]he question of what standard applies to school library book removal decisions is unresolved.”117 The court concluded:the standard that failed to attract a majority in the Pico case [is]: school officials may not remove books from library shelves simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by their removal to prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nation-alism, religion, or other matters of opinion.”118Yet, even after identifying what it believed to be the standard Justice Brennan proposed, the Eleventh Circuit signaled the limited 112.

Unconstitutional Discrimination against LGBTQ and Race Discussions under the Guise of “Educational Unsuitability”It is no secret that America has been embroiled in partisan politics and the country is facing a stark divide among party lines.121 But, as the Supreme Court recently noted, “America’s public schools are the nurseries of democracy. Our representative democracy only works if we protect the ‘marketplace of ideas.’”122 Yet, the marketplace of ideas in the nurseries of our democracy has been, and is currently, plagued by a mass movement to purge public school libraries’ shelves of LGBTQ and racially sensitive content.123 Pico opened the door for school boards to remove books based on impermissible motives by constrain-ing courts to only finding a violation of the school boards’ discretion if the “decisive factor” in the school board’s decision was political.124 This has allowed individuals and groups motivated by restricting mate-rials related to race and LGBTQ content to successfully challenge such materials by sneaking in unconstitutional, politically driven bans under the guise of “educational unsuitability.”125 119.

For a brief list of these types of groups, see also Nat’l Coal. Against Censorship & Gay & Lesbian All. Against Defamation, supra note 13.146 DEPAUL LAW REVIEW [Vol. 73:129This is clear from the court’s decision in C.K.-W. by and through T.K. v. Wentzville R-IV School District, in which the school board found the removal of a book involving racism was allowed because it was educationally unsuitable.126 The “plaintiffs alleged that the removal of book from the district’s libraries is ‘part of a targeted campaign’ by two private groups ‘to remove particular ideas and viewpoints about race .  .  . from school libraries.”127 Further, plaintiffs asserted that the book was removed because of the dislike of the ideas or opinions in the book.128 Yet, the court had to do little work to decline plaintiffs’ argu-ment because of Pico’s “decisive factor” language.129 The court found that plaintiffs’ evidence was only based on “‘information and belief,’ that the ‘ordinary course and procedures for consideration of weeding’ were not followed.”130 Thus, prior to analyzing whether the book in question was vulgar or educationally unsuitable, the court signaled plaintiffs’ argument did not have much merit due to the lack of support that the decisive factor in banning the book was a narrowly political one.131 Indeed, the court signaled that only an extreme example of a pretextual reason for the removal of a book would work in plaintiffs’ favor.132 Further, the case of Case v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 223, although favor-able to the plaintiffs of the case, exhibited the vast amount of evidence needed to qualify as a “decisive factor” displaying an intent to deny access to books based on disapproval of the messages expressed within.133 The book at issue was Annie on My Mind, a novel concerning a roman-tic relationship between teenage girls.134 In its discussion of the board’s motivation for removal, the court noted that numerous board members expressed views not having to do with educational suitability, but rather with their own personal beliefs and preferences about their ideas of orthodoxy.135 Although the board members tried to state their reasons for removing the book was because it was educationally unsuitable, the court used Pico to “assess the credibility of [school officials’] justifications for 126.

The prec-edential value is unclear, and even when there may be an impermissible motive at play, in order to overcome the pretexts of educational unsuit-ability or vulgarity and find the motivation is really to restrict ideas which one disagrees with, the evidence must be obvious. Based on the foregoing reasons, if the issue of public-school book bans comes before the Supreme Court again, the Court should instead modernize the test by looking to the similarities between social media sites and modern public-school libraries, affording these libraries similar protections as social media websites.D. A Stronger and Modern FrameworkAs Justice Burger stated in his Pico dissent, “[t]he First Amendment, as with other parts of the Constitution, must deal with new problems in a changing world.”139 One such new problem is social media websites.140 Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) grants social media platforms near immunity from liability for the content posted to their sites.141 Additionally, by virtue of the CDA, and social media com-panies’ status as private actors, decisions to keep or remove content are strongly insulated from pressure by political advocacy groups and gov-ernment officials.142 The CDA states that “[n]o provider or user of an 136.

Attorney General, Florida,144 the plaintiff represented various Internet and social media platforms in an action challenging Florida’s statutes regulating social media pro-viders.145 The State of Florida argued that social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, do not “engage[] in constitutionally protected expressive activity when they moderate and curate the content that they disseminate on their platforms.”146  The Eleventh Circuit held “that it is substantially likely that social-media companies—even the biggest ones—are ‘private actors’ whose rights the First Amendment protects,” that their content-moderation decisions are protected exercises of edi-torial judgment, and that parts of Florida’s statute unconstitutionally burden ‘large platforms’ ability to engage in content moderation . . . .”147 The court highlighted: (1) a social media platform “doesn’t create most of the original content on its site,” most of that content is created by the site’s users while a platform “might publish terms of service or commu-nity standards;” and (2) the information provided to users when they visit a site like Facebook or Twitter is curated and edited.148 Addition-ally, the court found that the platforms exercised editorial judgment by removing posts that violate its term of service or community stan-dards (e.g., hate speech, pornography, or violent content).149 Notably, the court concluded that “a social-media platform serves as an inter-mediary between users who have chosen to partake of the service the platform provides and thereby participate in the community it has cre-ated” and that a platform’s decision to remove content communicates a message of disapproval.150 The Eleventh Circuit ultimately struck down the part of the statute that limited the power of social media platforms to moderate and curate content.151 143. 47 U.S.C. § 230 (c)(1).144.

Id. at 1209–10.2023] POLITICAL ADVOCACY GROUPS 149The role of modern public school libraries is similar to that of social media platforms—they act as intermediaries that provide curated and edited content for students who choose to use the library, and typi-cally provide curated and edited internet services as well.152 As Justice Brennan pointed out, nothing in Pico affects the discretion a local school board has in adding books to their libraries.153 Similarly, social media platforms have discretion in deciding what content they will add, such as community standards, and allow to be added to their sites.154 Given these similarities between social media platforms and public school libraries and the need for a new book banning frame-work, the Supreme Court should look to NetChoice, LLC v. Attorney General, Florida to derive this model.155 The model should look to the “special characteristics of the school library that make that environ-ment especially appropriate for the recognition of the First Amendment right of students”156 by: (1) extending the First Amendment’s protection of editorial judgments to cover a public school library’s curation and filtering judgments; (2) treating public school libraries as private actors that engage in First-Amendment protected activity through their cura-tion and filtering of books; and (3) applying First Amendment scrutiny to any new law concerning school board book bans. This model would replace the permissive Pico standard with a stronger standard that would no longer allow political advocacy groups to put forth pretextual arguments under the guise of “educational unsuitability” or “vulgar-ity” to successfully pressure local school board members into banning books. This is not a perfect model, but it follows the idea expressed in Pico that school boards should play a role in determining the content of their libraries, because Pico’s book banning standard did not “affect[] in any way the discretion of a local school board to choose books to add to the libraries of their schools.”157 A standard such as this accounts for the technological advancements of today, where kids find more objection-able content on their phones than from reading books in the library.158 As a result of Pico’s lackluster guidance and weak precedential value, 152.

ImpactA. Impact on StudentsMaoria Kirker, the lead of the Teaching and Learning Team at George Mason University Libraries, points out the students who are subject to these book removals/bans are those grades K-12.161 Many of them may not have the luxury of turning anywhere but their school libraries, and thus, those children do not have the opportunity to explore the diver-sity of ideas, characters, etc., from those books that are unavailable.162 Maoria points out that those diverse ideas and concepts are what “help children think through history, ideas, and concepts from differ-ent angles.”163 This is an essential skill for critical thinking, which serves students throughout their lifetime, and when students miss out on that opportunity, it has the potential to “create significant gaps in knowledge for young learners.”164 Many teenagers have conveyed the negative effects of book bans.165 Students have expressed numerous different opinions about how they view book bans including, generally that: (1) it is wrong to shield kids from reality; (2) books are meant to chal-lenge and educate; (3) book bans are not effective and there are other ways to handle sensitive subjects; (4) parents and lawmakers deciding what students should read is a slippery slope; (5) book banning limits thinking; and (6) book banning is a form of discrimination.166Additionally, the banning of books does not protect students from certain ideas or ideologies, but rather it “only fosters ignorance and 159.

No matter how hor-rible our history is, it is more important than ever that students are well informed to prevent repeating history.”169 Additionally, the impact of banning books and ideas concerning marginalized LGBTQ students is incredibly serious.170 In 2022, “45% of LGBTQ youth seriously con-sidered suicide in the past year.”171 The notion that LGBTQ students are less because they are different or do not belong has contributed to serious damage to the LGBTQ community, and the ease in which schools can ban such content representing acceptance of the LGBTQ community may increase the risk of that damage in a population.172 It is clear that the LGBTQ community benefits from seeing themselves rep-resented and accepted,173 but that such continued discrimination, like book bans, will contribute to poor mental health.174B.

See id. 152 DEPAUL LAW REVIEW [Vol. 73:129Carolyn Foote, a retired Texas school librarian to “establish Freedom [sic] Fighters, a kind of support group for librarians in distress.”175 These librarians are in need of such support because of the increase from conservative parent groups calling for book bans “often by and about queer and Black people and lobbying for their removal from library shelves,” which has led to unbearable stress for many librarians.176 School librarians are also experiencing more one-on-one meetings with parents, which can be emotionally taxing.177 Additionally, school librar-ians are not only dealing with school board meetings and investigations, but they also have to deal with books being silently pulled without any notice.178 On top of all this, school librarians have been compared to pedophiles and cockroaches, and worry about ending up on the news.179 Public school librarians also have to keep up with different bills that threaten monetary penalties and prison.180 A possible portent of things to come is a recently enacted law in the conservative majority state of Florida, known as HB 1467, which provides that some school librarians are now being tasked with acting as arbiters on whether books violate the law, and play a factor in whether a teacher faces felony charges.181 C.

ConclusionUnder the current framework of Pico, the test for determining whether a public school’s banning of a book is permissible easily allows parents and politically driven advocacy groups to pressure school boards into justifying a book ban because the content is “educationally unsuitable” or “vulgar.” If the issue of public school book bans come before the Supreme Court again, the Court should consider the simi-larities of modern public libraries to social media platforms and use 182.
