BAUMLE,** SHAWN KRAVICH,***ADAM P. RoMERO,**** R. BRADLEY SEARS*****INTRODUCTIONMarylanders are currently discussing the extension of marriagerights to same-sex couples. Over the last fifteen years, the publicdebate has evolved to include considerations of the social andeconomic consequences of marriage.1 Economic consequences, inparticular, have assumed a growing role in the public discourse aboutmarriage. As the debate continues, policymakers have increasinglyquestioned the potential impact of same-sex marriages on economicdevelopment and on state budgets. Concerns about the impact of same-sex couples' marriages on the state budget have focused on thepresumed costs of granting gay couples equal access to the benefits ofmarriage, including health insurance, pensions, and property transfers.In this report, we undertake an analysis to assess the budgetaryimpact of civil marriage for same-sex couples in Maryland. Ouranalysis of the fiscal impact of marriage for same-sex couples inMaryland is based on the same methods we used in previous studies onCalifornia,2  Colorado, 3  Connecticut, 4  Massachusetts, 5  New* M.V.

On the one hand,more marriages would likely mean higher expenditures for the State onemployee benefits. On the other hand, the State would likely see lowerexpenditures on means-tested public benefit programs. Similarly, statetax revenues would be expected to change.Section I of this report outlines the estimated number of same-sex couples in Maryland and estimates the number of couples who willlikely marry if allowed. In Section II, we present our predictions of thetax-based budgetary impact on the State, separating our analysis intoeach category of taxation that marriage could affect. In Section III, weestimate the state-wide savings additional marriages will likely bringto Maryland's public benefits programs. Section IV outlines the costsof expanding benefits to the same-sex spouses of state employees.Section V estimates other associated costs that could arise fromexpanding the right to marriage. In Section VI, we broaden ouranalysis to look at the economic impact of marriages by same-sexcouples on Maryland's businesses. In section VII, we summarize theexpected policy impact for each expenditure or revenue categoryaddressed.Throughout this report, we estimate the costs and benefits ofmarriage conservatively. Our estimates are based on the most cautiousassumptions - ones that tend to predict higher costs for the State andfewer benefits for couples. Even so, the annual net fiscal benefit ofallowing same-sex marriage is $3.2 million; the overall economicbenefit during the first three years is as much as $94 million.Moreover, evidence suggests significantly more same-sex couplesreside in Maryland than reported by the Census.' 5 If so, net gains tothe State will be even greater.15. For evidence that the 2000 Census undercounted the number of cohabitating same-sex couples in the United States, see M.V. LEE BADGETr & MARC A. ROGERS, LEFT OUT OFTHE COUNT: MISSING SAME-SEX COUPLES IN CENSUS 2000 (2003), available athttp://www.iglss.org/media/files/c2k_leftout.pdf (noting that two surveys estimated theundercount at 16 percent to 19 percent); DAVID M.

MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSI. THE NUMBER OF COUPLES AFFECTEDOne of the most important factors in determining the economicimpact of new marriages in Maryland is the number of same-sexcouples who will likely marry if given the option. A couple's choice toenter into a legally binding relationship such as marriage involvesmany considerations. For this reason, not all couples will necessarilychoose to marry. At the very least, the decision is likely to include aweighing of the symbolic value of public and legal recognition of therelationship with the particular rights and responsibilities implied bythe legal status of marriage. Here we make projections based on theexperience of other states that have allowed same-sex couples to marryor achieve a related legal status.Massachusetts was the first state to allow same-sex marriage,and gives us the best basis for predicting the proportion of same-sexcouples that would likely marry. In Massachusetts, at least 9,695same-sex couples have married, constituting 57 percent of the state'ssame-sex couples in Census 2000.16A few other states have had experience with civil unions anddomestic partnerships. While these statutes differ from civil marriage,they provide a significant package of rights and responsibilities thatstates offer to opposite-sex couples. For this reason, states that offercivil unions or domestic partnerships provide additional data on howmany same-sex couples would marry if given the opportunity. InVermont, 71 percent of same-sex couples have entered into a civilunion since 2000.17 In California, the number of domestic partnershipsincreased with the addition of significant new rights andresponsibilities. From January 1, 2000 through May 31, 2007, 43,756scouples registered their partnerships, constituting almost forty-eight16.

As of April 2007, there have been 1,367 civil unions in Vermont between in-statesame-sex partners. See Cindy Chooley, Vermont Department of Health, Monthly Report onCounts for Civil Unions (2007) (on file with authors). Dividing 1,367 by the number of same-sex couples in Vermont (1,933) means 71 percent of Vermont's same-sex couples haveentered into a civil union.

E-mail from Special Filings/Domestic Partnership Unit, Secretary of State,California, to Shawn Kravich, Williams Institute (June 12, 2007) (on file with authors).298 [VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYpercent of California's same-sex couples as calculated according toCensus 2000 data.'9Based on the experience of these states, we conservativelyassume that half of Maryland's same-sex couples would marry if theyhad the legal right to do so. Using 2005 American Community Surveydata, we counted 15,607 cohabitating same-sex couples living inMaryland, up from 11,243 counted in Census 2000.20 Based on otherstates' experiences, we predict that half of these, or about 7,800 same-sex couples, would marry if allowed to do so.A more precise estimate of the percentage of same-sex couplesthat would choose to marry is unnecessary to conclude that the policywill have a positive net effect on Maryland's budget. Our majorfindings are not sensitive to the exact number of couples marrying orregistering since the costs and benefits of a larger number arerespectively and reciprocally offsetting. In other words, our estimatesare conservative because if more couples marry than originallypredicted, savings in state benefits and added tax revenue will offsetadditional losses in tax revenues. Conversely, if fewer couples marrythan estimated, both the savings and any costs of same-sex marriagewill decrease respectively.II. IMPACT ON TAX REVENUESExtending marriage to same-sex couples in Maryland willaffect the state taxes on income, property transfer, and inheritance.Because same-sex marriage will also trigger an increase in taxablewedding spending by same-sex couples, the impact on Maryland'ssales tax revenue has been included in the analysis in this section.A. Impact on Income TaxExtending marriage to same-sex couples will impact theincome tax revenues collected by the State. Same-sex couples thatmarry will have the right to file their income tax returns jointly, just asdifferent-sex married couples do. With this change in status, two19. Though California's domestic partnerships are available to different-sex couplesunder specific circumstances, we conservatively assume that 95 percent of domestic partnersin California are same-sex couples.20.

MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSindividuals who previously filed as \"single\" now combine theirincomes. Some of these couples will end up paying more or less inincome tax when they file as married. Most couples will pay anaverage of about $50 less in annual income taxes. Overall, simulationssuggest that an extension of marriage to same-sex couples in Marylandwill have a small negative impact on state income tax revenues.To estimate the net tax impact of allowing same-sex couples tofile jointly, we use the income and household characteristics of same-sex \"unmarried partner\" couples living in Maryland gathered by theCensus Bureau's five percent Public Use Microdata Sample(PUMS). 21 Using the Census data on total income and number ofchildren in a household, it is possible to estimate each couple's taxesbefore and after marriage. First, calculate what couples pay now whenthey file as a \"single\" individual or \"head of household.\" Then,estimate the tax payments for the couple if they were married andfiling jointly. Using these estimates, determine the difference betweentheir pre- and post-joint filing taxes, calculating the net effect of same-sex marriage on the State's income tax revenue.In this analysis, assume that tax consequences of marriage willnot impact the choice of whether to marry. Overall, research suggeststhat the possibility for increased taxation has a minimal impact on thelikelihood of a couple's decision to marry.22 Several other assumptionssimplify the tax calculations. First, if the householder reported livingwith one or more of his or her children under eighteen in Census 2000,we assumed that the householder filed as head of household and thatthe partner filed as single. Second, when the householder has nochildren living with them, we assume that both partners currently fileas single and will file jointly if allowed to marry.We calculate taxes twice, with and without the joint filingstatus. Given the available data, use a simplified tax simulation forestimates. To calculate Maryland gross income, add together all formsof income. Then, assume each partner claimed one exemption apiece ifsingle, another if over age sixty-five, and one dependent exemption perchild. Apply the 2006 Maryland state tax schedule to calculate thetaxes owed by each individual and couple: (1) first, when each partner21.

The Impact of incomeTaxes on Marriage, 66 ECONOMICA 297, 309-10 (1999) (finding that the \"marriage penalty\"--the situation in which some couples pay more taxes when they marry than if they remainsingle-has a relatively small effect on an individual woman's decision to marry, whereasthere is statistically no negative effect on men).[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYfiles as single or as head of household (if children are present), and (2)second, when the couple files jointly.Our model shows that state income taxes would decrease forapproximately seventy-five percent of same-sex couples in Marylandif they could file jointly as married couples. The average decrease intheir taxes would be fifty-four dollars. For three percent of couples,filing jointly would have no impact on their taxes; twenty-two percentwould see their taxes increase, with an average increase in taxes ofeighty-eight dollars.Table 1 presents the average and total changes in income taxespaid by couples in the three categories. Assuming that fifty-percent ofthese individuals will marry, as per our discussion in Section I, theprojected decrease in income tax revenue is slightly over $132,000.Table 1: Summary of income tax revenue calculationsPercent of Average Changein Taxes per Total ChangeCouplesCoupleIncrease in Taxes 22 percent $88 $248,831Same Amount of 3 percent 0 0TaxesDecrease in Taxes 75 percent ($54) ($514,210)Net Change in - - ($265,380)Income Tax Revenueif All Marry50 percent TOTAL ($132,690)B. Impact on Inheritance TaxAllowing same-sex couples to marry would minimally impactthe amount of revenue that Maryland collects from its inheritance tax.The inheritance tax is levied on property that passes under a will orunder the intestate laws of succession, and on property that passesfrom a decedent to beneficiaries.23 Property passing to a spouse isexempt from taxation in Maryland. Additionally, property passing tolineal descendants or their spouses, as well as a parent, grandparent,stepchild, stepparent, siblings, or charities, is exempt from taxation.23. See Comptroller of Maryland, Inheritance Tax, http://individuals.marylandtaxes.com/estatetax/inherit.asp (last visited Mar. 10, 2008).2007]302 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSFor all other individuals, the rate of taxation is ten percent of the valueof property passed.Currently, the state taxes same-sex couples at the same rate asother unmarried individuals, even if a same-sex couple would chooseto marry if permitted. Calculating the impact of extending marriage tosame-sex couples on inheritance tax revenue is complicated. Same-sexcouples' estates will inevitably vary in terms of size and value, theextent to which they choose to leave all or part of their estates to theirpartners, the number of other beneficiaries to their estates, and themeasures they may take to mitigate the taxation of estates that will beinherited by their partners. Accordingly, we estimate the followingimpact of same-sex marriage on inheritance tax revenue using the mostrecent and'reliable data available on Maryland same-sex couples andU.S. households. Moreover, our assumptions about these couples areintentionally as conservative as possible, producing estimates on thehigh end of the likely range of costs to the State.1. Mortality of domestic partnersTo calculate the impact that extending marriage to same-sexcouples would have on inheritance tax revenue, first we mustdetermine the number of individuals in a same-sex relationship whodie annually. To do so, we first determine the number of individuals insame-sex couples, which is double the number of Maryland's same-24sex couples noted earlier, to get 31,214. We then use Maryland'sannual age-adjusted death rate (.0091)25 to estimate the mortality ofindividuals in these couples. Multiplying these numbers, we calculatethat 284 individuals in same-sex couples die each year.As explained in Section I, 50 percent of same-sex coupleswould marry if allowed. Based on that assumption, we estimate that142 same-sex spouses would die each year. With an average of 142deaths per year we can approximate the impact of same-sex marriageon Maryland's inheritance tax revenue.2. Median transfer inheritance tax for surviving unmarriedsame-sex partnersNext, we estimate the median tax that-in the absence ofmarriage rights-would be paid by a decedent's same-sex survivor.24. 15,607 (2) = 31,214.25. The Joint Center, Table 29: Age-adjusted death rates, according to race, Hispanicorigin, geographic division, and State: United States, average annual 1979-81, 1989-91, and1997-99 (2001), http://www.jointcenter.orgIDB/table/census_2000/Alcoa/health/ageadjusted_deathrate_99.pdf.[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYHere, we use the median net worth of households in the United Statesfrom the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, adjusted for inflation.26We do not use the median net worth of all couples, but instead themedian net worth of couples falling into five percentile groups interms of net worth. This allows us to capture the fact that, dependingon the size of the decedent's estate, some surviving partners may payno inheritance tax while others may pay a substantial amount. We thendivide the median household net worth for each percentile group bytwo, assuming that unmarried couples roughly share the assets andliabilities in their households.Next we take into account the probate and funeral expenses,which will reduce the taxable value of these estates. In Maryland, aprobate fee is charged for the estate's administrative processing. Thesefees range from $2 to over $2,500, depending on the size of theestate. 27 In addition to administrative charges, fees for personalrepresentatives and/or attorneys of the estate may be deducted. Forestates over $20,000, the maximum cost for these fees is set at $1,800plus 3.6 percent for amounts over $20,000; for estates under $20,000,the maximum fee is 9 percent.28 To estimate funeral expenses we usethe current average cost of an adult funeral in the United States, whichis $7,323.29In order to determine the size of the decedent's estate thatwould be inherited by his or her unmarried partner, we take intoaccount two common bequests that do not generate inheritance taxesunder Maryland law: gifts to charities and children. Many individuals,particularly those with larger estates, will make charitable bequests,which constitute the largest bequests with the exception of those tosurviving spouses.30 Both Maryland and the federal IRS exempt such26.

If the property subject to administration is $20,000 or less, the commissionmay not exceed 9 percent of the gross estate. If the property subject to administration is over$20,000, the commission may not exceed $1,800 plus 3.6 percent applied to the excess over$20,000. Because probate is a specialized service, with limited competition, we assume thatthe average costs will be very close to the maximum of 3.6 percent applied to larger estates.29.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSbequests from taxation. 31 While a recent study revealed that 8% of thepopulation has included charitable bequests in estate plans, 32 the bestinformation about charitable bequests comes from federal estate taxreturns, which in 2005 were required for estates worth more than $1.5million; the data about such returns indicates that the frequency andsize of charitable bequests usually increase with the value of theestate.33Accordingly, we only calculate a charitable deduction for ourtop quartile of individuals. We assume these individuals will havecharitable bequest patterns similar to decedents filing federal estate taxreturns: on average nineteen percent will make charitable bequests,which will represent fourteen percent of their net estate.34 We usethese statistics to create a weighted average charitable deduction ofthree percent for all decedents falling in our top quartile. Again, theseestimates are conservative because members of same-sex couples inMaryland might currently make larger charitable bequests thanmarried persons, in order to avoid the tax consequences of bequeathingto unmarried partners.In addition to charitable bequests, twenty-one percent of same-sex couples in Maryland have children under eighteen years old intheir households. Some of these individuals will leave all or a portionof their estates to their children. Accordingly, we next estimatedeductions resulting from gifts to children. It is difficult to determinehow many individuals will bequeath all or a share of their estate totheir children. Studies of married couples reveal a majority of marriedtestators-fifty to eighty-five percent-leave everything to theirsurviving spouse, even when they have surviving children. 35Therefore, we make the conservative assumption that only fifteenpercent of individuals in a same-sex partnership with children willleave a portion of their estate to their children; this is equivalent to thelowest estimate of married couples leaving a gift to their children.

However, it is quite likely that in orderto avoid inheritance taxes, decedents with unmarried partners,especially wealthy ones, already employ other lawful measures toreduce the tax burden.Finally, to estimate the median tax burden for estates ofdecedents in each percentile group, we compute the Marylandinheritance tax for our estimated median taxable estates that wouldpass to unmarried same-sex partners. We begin with 2007, although itis likely that it would take some time before same-sex couples' right tomarry would take effect. Table 2 summarizes the steps describedabove to determine the taxable estate for decedents in same-sexcouples, in each net worth group.36. Obviously, some individuals might leave all of their estates to their children whileothers may only leave a fraction. We choose 50 percent, in part, based on our conservativeassumption about the percentage of unmarried individuals who are leaving a portion of theirestate to their children.37. Thus, we assume 79 percent of individuals in same-sex relationships in Maryland donot have children and will leave no bequests to children. Of the 21 percent who do havechildren, we assume that 85 percent will leave nothing to their children and the remaining 15percent will leave 50 percent of their estates to their children. Thus, the weighted average forthe size of the bequest to children is [(79*0) + (17.85*0) + (3.15*0.5)] / 100.2007]306 U. MD. L.J.

Aggregate impact on inheritance tax revenueTo determine the aggregate impact of same-sex marriage oninheritance tax revenue, we multiply the estimated number of same-sex partners likely to die annually by the estimated median tax burdenfor surviving partners in each percentile group. We do this by dividingthe estimated number of such decedents into our net worth percentilegroups and then multiplying by the median tax burden for each group.We then add the aggregate tax burdens for each group together toestimate the overall impact on inheritance tax revenue.In 2007, we find no projected inheritance tax burden due to thehigh filing threshold set for the inheritance tax of $1,000,000. Thesame is true for subsequent years, when the filing threshold is raisedeven higher. Thus, we conclude that the tax liability for unmarriedsame-sex partners-after the relevant expenses and bequests have beendeducted from the estate value-is negligible. Eliminating that taxliability through marriage would have little or no effect on stateinheritance tax revenue.An alternative way to consider the Maryland's potential lossfrom changes in inheritance tax revenue is to use federal data onspousal bequests. The IRS reports that the average taxable estate in38. Probate expense calculations in Table 2 include both administrative and personalrepresentative/attorneys' fees and costs.[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRY2003 included a spousal bequest of $5.3 million. If we assume that asame-sex unmarried partner leaving an estate of similar size, wouldbequeath the same amount to their partner, opting not to incorporate acharitable bequest in order to reduce the tax burden, the partner wouldnow be liable for $530,000 in Maryland inheritance tax. In order toaccount for the fact that only a small percentage of the population issubject to the inheritance tax, we divide the total number of spousalbequests over one million dollars (2,718) by the number of marriedpeople who died that year (945,795)39 and then multiply the result bythe number of same-sex spouses estimated to die annually.4° Weconclude that less than one (0.40)41 same-sex spouse would have beenliable for the state inheritance tax in a given year if unmarried, orrather that a same-sex unmarried partner's estate would have generatedtax revenue approximately twice every five years. The loss to the Stateof Maryland of $1,060,000 every five years is minimal and supportsthe conclusion that marriage for same-sex couples is unlikely to haveany significant impact on Maryland's inheritance tax revenue. Weconservatively include in our estimate that the State will lose anaverage of $217,30042 in inheritance tax revenues each year if it wereto make marriage available to same-sex couples.C. Impact on Transfer Tax RevenueIn general, real estate sales are subject to a state transfer taxequal to 0.5 percent of the selling price.43 Certain kinds of transfers areexempt from taxation, however, including transfers of propertybetween spouses or former spouses.44 Under current law, transfers ofproperty between members of an unmarried same-sex couple aretaxable. Therefore, if same-sex couples are allowed to marry, sometransfers that were once taxable will no longer be. Thus the State'stransfer tax revenue might be affected by same-sex marriage.We expect the potential impact of such transfers on taxrevenues to be relatively insignificant.. The key question involves the39. Kenneth D.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSnumber of taxable transfers that currently occur between same-sexpartners and former partners, which would go untaxed if the couplewere married. We believe such transfers are rare for several reasons.1. Dissolution-related transfersFirst, transfers between partners ending their relationship occurinfrequently due to the low rate of dissolution of same-sexrelationships in each given year. In Vermont, about one percent ofcivil unions dissolve annually.45 Assuming the same percentage existsin Maryland, roughly 150 relationships out of the estimated 15,60046unmarried same-sex couples in Maryland dissolve each year. Second,sixty-six percent of Maryland's same-sex couples live in a homeowned by one or both of the partners. As a result, only an estimatedone hundred dissolutions per year have the potential to generate ataxable real estate transaction. However, as some homes may not bejointly owned, some of those couples will not transfer real estate. Inaddition, the tax currently creates an incentive to seek ways of dividingproperty that do not involve taxable transfers of real estate. To takethis factor into account, we assume that only half, or fifty, of suchcouples will jointly own real estate. Finally, some non-maritaldissolution-related taxable events are likely to continue once same-sexcouples are allowed to marry since only half of such couples are likelydo so. Thus, up to 25 taxable events per year under current law couldpotentially be avoided if same-sex couples can marry. Overall, weexpect a negligible fiscal impact for transfers related to dissolutions.2. Other transfersTransfers between unmarried same-sex partners seem mostlikely to occur when one partner brings property to the relationshipand wants to share ownership with the other partner. But it is unlikelythat such transfers currently generate significant transfer tax revenues.First, two-thirds of Maryland's same-sex couples live in a houseowned by one partner, meaning that one-third of same-sex couples do45. Vermont recorded 7,800 civil unions from 2000 through 2005. 1,234 of the civilunions involved Vermont residents. In this same time period, Vermont's family courts haveentered 92 dissolutions of civil unions, or an average of 15 per year. Only Vermont residentsmay dissolve civil unions.

The numberswere rounded down to make calculations easier and ensure more conservative figures.47. ADAm P. ROMERO ET AL., CENSUS SNAPSHOT: MARYLAND (November, 2007),available at http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/MarylandCensusSnapshot.pdf.[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYnot own a home. Second, both partners might have purchased thehome together, so no transfer between partners would be needed.Third, in other cases, the owning partner might not have transferredownership simply because of the existence of the tax.Statewide, in fiscal year 2007, the median sales price of aMaryland home was $315,000.48 A transfer of half the value of thathome to an unmarried partner would have generated $793 in transfertax revenue for the Sate. Next we make the highly conservative-although highly implausible-assumption that two-thirds of marryingcouples, or 5,200 existing homeowners, would have transferred half ofthe ownership in the home in the absence of marriage. Thus, same-sexmarriage would render these events non-taxable. However, as notedabove, the true number is likely to be much less than 5,200, since weare assuming that no couple had undertaken such a change in title upto this point. Still, using this very conservative figure, over severalyears the State could lose a maximum of $4,123,600.Finally, it is likely that the right to marry could generateadditional sales of homes to same-sex couples, thus increasing transfertax revenue, as argued in a recent study by the New YorkComptroller's Office.4 9 The emotional stability and financial securityassociated with marriage may encourage same-sex couples to purchasea house, and those sales to couples will generate new tax revenue.Indeed, Census data suggest that there is room for home sales to rise.The rate of home ownership among married different-sex couples inMaryland is 83 percent, significantly higher than the 66 percent rateamong same-sex couples.5 °Such an increase in revenue from new sales would help tooffset any loss in taxes from untaxed transfers. Therefore, we concludethat the net transfer tax revenue impact of marriages by same-sexcouples is likely to be quite small in any given year, whether positiveor negative.D. Inpact on Sales TaxExtending the right to marry to same-sex couples would verylikely increase spending on wedding-related goods and services by in-state and out-of-state same-sex couples. Presently, Massachusetts is48.

Based on our analysis presented in Section VI, 53 we estimatethat a decision by Maryland to allow same-sex couples to wed couldresult in approximately $282 million in additional spending onweddings and tourism in the State. Because Maryland imposes a tax offive percent on the sale of most services, this spending could generateabout fourteen million dollars in tax revenue, with $3.19 million fromin-state couples and $10.9 million from out-of-state couples. Taxrevenue could be higher, depending on the amount spent for speciallytaxed, tourism services like car rentals (taxed at a rate of 11.5%). 54E. Summary of Tax EffectsTable 3 summarizes the tax effects of allowing same-sexcouples to marry. We spread the property transfer tax and sales taxeffects over three years to make them comparable with the income andinheritance tax estimates. The decrease in tax revenue for income,inheritance, and property transfer taxes are significantly smaller thanthe predicted increase in sales tax, even with the extremelyconservative assumption about property transfer tax revenue. The neteffect would be a gain to the State of almost three million dollars peryear.51. MASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 207, § 11 (1998).

PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SAVINGSMarriage implies a mutual obligation of support that isreflected in public assistance eligibility calculations. This section looksat the potential savings to the State if extending marriage means thatsame-sex couples are less likely to need public assistance or are lesslikely to qualify for it.A. Public Benefits ProgramsMaryland funds an array of public benefits programs with stateand federal sources, which provide subsidies and assistance to low-income individuals and families. Maryland's main TemporaryAssistance to Needy Families (TANE) program is the FamilyInvestment Program (FIP), the core components of which areTemporary Cash Assistance (TCA), Welfare Avoidance Grants(WAG), Emergency Assistance to Families with Children (EAFC),Disaster Assistance, and local Alternative Programs. 55 Maryland alsooffers separate state-funded TCA programs for certain individuals andfamilies who do not qualify for FIP programs. 56 Other forms ofassistance available to low income people in Maryland includeSupplemental Security Income (SSI), Medical Assistance (Medicaid),Public Assistance to Adults (PAA), Temporary Disability AssistanceProgram (TDAP), Medical Assistance Long Term Care (LTC),Maryland Children's Health Program (MCHP), Child Care Assistance,Maryland Energy Assistance Program (MEAP), Electric UniversalService Program (EUSP), Tel-life (Lifeline), Food Stamps, EmergencyFood Program (EFP), and Burial Assistance. 5755.

L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSB. Savings with Same-Sex MarriageEligibility for public assistance is means-tested and thereforedependent on the individual applicant's income and assets, as well as,for many programs, those of the applicant's family. For the manyprograms that consider a spouse's income and assets, a marriedapplicant is generally less likely to qualify for assistance than singleapplicants. Because same-sex couples are not permitted to marry inMaryland, people with same-sex partners are likely to be considered\"single\" when eligibility for these programs is assessed, for neither theState nor the federal government currently requires applicants toinclude an unmarried same-sex partner's income and assets. This\"single\" classification results in same-sex partners being more likely toqualify for public assistance. If same-sex couples were able to marry,however, both partners' income and assets could be counted indetermining eligibility, thus increasing the likelihood that applicantswould exceed income or asset thresholds. With fewer same-sexcouples participating in public benefits programs, state expenditureswould be significantly reduced.In Maryland, the main assistance programs that take maritalstatus into account in eligibility determinations are the FamilyInvestment Program (FIP), Medical Assistance (Medicaid), MarylandChildren's Health Program (MCHP), and Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI). Our calculations below, therefore, focus on theseprograms. Yet, because extending marriage to same-sex couples islikely to trim state spending on many public assistance programs notincluded in our calculations,58 the estimates below are conservative.For FIP (and for individuals qualifying for other benefits suchas Medical Assistance because they receive FIP) and for MCHP, theState generally determines applicant eligibility standards. 59 Withrespect to these programs, then, the State would be able to count asame-sex spouse's income and assets in determining the eligibility ofan individual or family. For SSI and Medicaid, however, the federalgovernment determines the generally applicable eligibility standards,58. Some same-sex couples' families may become eligible for some family-relatedbenefits if the couple is allowed to marry. However, the relative amount of money expendedon such programs is very small, and these types of family-related benefits are not in the formof direct financial assistance; rather, they take the form of assistance via educational andsimilar programs. Consequently, we do not offset our calculations to account for thispossibility.59. See Reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, 71Fed. Reg. 37,454, (June 29, 2006) (to be codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 261, 262, 263, 265) andCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 42 C.F.R. §457.1 (2001).[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYrestricting the State's discretion in developing its own applicationstandards and procedures. Because the federal Defense of MarriageAct (DOMA) purports to limit the definition of the word \"spouse\" todifferent-sex marriages, Maryland may be prohibited from including asame-sex spouse in eligibility determinations for those programs.6 °Nonetheless, in assessing eligibility for Medicaid and SSI, Marylandmay still be able to take into account the resources of same-sexspouses under state and federal regulations that require Maryland toconsider the resources of third parties who are legally liable for healthcare costs. 6 1 Medicaid is a provider of last resort, and federal and statelaw require the State to assure that Medicaid recipients utilize all otheravailable resources, i.e., third parties, to pay for all or part of theirmedical care needs before turning to Medicaid.62 Third parties areentities or individuals who are legally responsible for paying themedical claims of Medicaid recipients. They include any \"individualwho has either voluntarily accepted or been assigned legalresponsibility for the health care\" of a Medicaid applicant orrecipient. 64 The income and assets of a same-sex spouse might beconsidered under this \"third party\" category, resulting in essentiallythe same eligibility determinations as if a \"spouse\" category wasapplied.60. DOMA is a federal law that limits the definition of \"spouse\" in all federal laws andregulations to refer \"only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.\" Defenseof Marriage Act, Pub. L. 104-199, § 3(a), 100 Stat. 2419, 2419 (2006) (codified at I U.S.C. §7). \"Spouse\" is the term used to specify individuals whose assets and income may be takeninto account for SSI and Medicaid eligibility purposes. Thus, arguably, DOMA would preventthe state from interpreting the term \"spouse\" in the regulations to include a same-sex spouse.A related issue has arisen in Vermont with respect to that state's treatment of couples in a civilunion within the Medicaid program. See David Mace, Critics Say Rule Change Violates CivilUnions, THE TIMES ARGUS, Apr. 17, 2003. Recent correspondence from the Centers forMedicare and Medicaid Services to state agencies in Vermont and Massachusetts suggests thatthe states cannot treat same-sex spouses in the same way that different-sex spouses are treatedin the Medicaid program.61. Federal law mandates that states must \"take all reasonable measures to ascertain thelegal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available\" under Medicaid and toseek reimbursement in cases \"where such legal liability is found to exist.\" 42 U.S.C. 1396a(2007). In contrast, Maryland law dictates that \"[a]s a condition of eligibility for medicalassistance, a recipient is deemed to have assigned to the Secretary of Health and MentalHygiene or the Secretary's designee any rights to payment for medical care services from anythird party who has the legal liability to make payments for those services, to the extent of anypayments made by the Department on behalf of the recipient.\" MD.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSC. Calculations of SavingsTo estimate the impact of permitting same-sex marriage, weagain draw on Maryland data from Census 2000. The Census askedrespondents to report the amount of income from various sources,including the amount received from Supplemental Security Income(SSI) and from \"public assistance or welfare payments from the stateor local welfare office\" in 1999.65 According to census data, in 1999same-sex couples in Maryland received $2,339,100 in SSI and$254,166 in public assistance. These totals represent, respectively,0.55 percent of all SSI income and 0.2 percent of all public assistancereceived in Maryland in 1999.66 If we assume that the proportions ofSSI and public assistance to same-sex couples remain the same in2006, we can estimate current spending by multiplying thosepercentages by the total amount of money Maryland currently spends67on those programs. Because the Census does not define with anyprecision \"public assistance,\" we utilize the 0.2 percent for every typeof public assistance, with the exception of SSI, which is reportedseparately on the Census.To calculate Maryland's savings from same-sex marriage, weagain assume that half of the same-sex couples will marry. Thisassumption takes into account the fact that the possible loss of benefitswill deter some same-sex couples from entering marriages. 68 However,an adjustment must be made to account for the fact that some same-sexspouses, though married, will continue to qualify for benefits,69 just assome currently married couples do. 70 We assume that half of same-sex65.

For each category (SSI and public assistance), percentages were calculated bydividing the amount that same-sex couples in that category received by the total amountreceived in that category in Maryland.67. We use the most recent data available on expenditures because they are more likelyto reflect current and future expenditures than 1999 levels. Therefore, we do not merely inflatethe 1999 expenditures to 2007 levels because expenditures in 1999 differ from recent years.68. Research on welfare benefits finds at most a very small disincentive effect. SeeRobert Moffitt, Incentive Effects of the U.S. Welfare System: A Review, 30 J. OF ECON. LIT. 27(1992).69. For example, when a couple marries, the applicant's partner may have few assetsand low income, allowing the program recipient to remain in the public assistance program.70. According to the Census, in Maryland in 1999, 1.57 percent of same-sex couplesreceived SSI and 1.04 percent of same-sex couples received public assistance; 0.76 percent ofmarried couples received SSI and 0.48 percent of married couples received public assistance.For each category (SSI and public assistance), percentages were calculated by dividing the[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYcouples marry and that same-sex spouses will receive SSI and publicassistance at the same rate as different-sex spouses, i.e. 0.76 percentand 0.48 percent, respectively. Further, we assume that unmarriedsame-sex couples will continue to receive SSI and public assistance atthe currently observed rates, i.e. 1.57 percent and 1.04 percent,respectively. We estimate, then, that current expenditures on same-sexcouples would be reduced by about 26 percent for SSI and 27 percentfor public assistance.71With same-sex marriage, we anticipate the total savings to theState in public assistance expenditures to exceed $1.5 million per year,as summarized in Table 4. This estimate includes savings not only instate funds,72 but also in federal FIP/TANF funds because the TANFblock grant Maryland receives from the federal government is notlikely to be reduced if fewer people in same-sex relationships qualify.That is, if marriage for same-sex couples means fewer FIP recipients,but not less federal funding, savings will accrue to the State in theform of freed federal monies. These calculations also assume thatDOMA will not bar the State from including a same-sex spouse'sincome and assets to calculate eligibility for Medicaid and SSI. IfDOMA does prevent the State from including same-sex spouses ineligibility determinations for Medicaid and SSI, then the savings frompublic benefit programs where the State determines eligibility wouldbe approximately $172,000. As noted above, however, even if DOMAprevents the State from directly counting same-sex marriages, the Statemay still be able to count both spouses' incomes and assets viaregulations concerning the financial obligations of legally responsiblethird-parties.number of married same-sex couples that receive benefits by the total number of married orsame-sex couples in Maryland. The numbers were derived from the 2000 Census.71. The reduction rate for public assistance was calculated as follows: .5[1-(.48/1.04)]=.269, or 26.9 percent. The reduction rate for SSI was calculated as follows: .511-(.76/1.57)]=.258, or 25.8 percent.72. Our calculations do not include the over $100 million in state monies used to fundthe state Earned Income Tax Credit, since eligibility is assessed through the income taxsystem, whereas other public assistance and non-assistance programs are funded by the TANFblock grant.2007] 315316 U.

EXPANSION OF EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TO MARYLAND'SSAME-SEX COUPLESA. Healthcare Benefit PlansMaryland provides certain fringe benefits to state employees,employees' spouses, and their dependent children. 73 The State offers achoice of eight healthcare plans to its employees: two of these plansare PPO, three are POS, and three are HMO.74 An employee has theoption to provide healthcare coverage to a spouse under all eight ofthese plans.75 Maryland also provides certain retirement and death-related benefits to the spouses of employees and retirees. 76 BecauseMaryland does not offer health care benefits to employees' same-sexpartners, extending marriage to same-sex couples will likely result in arise in the State's contribution to health insurance benefits.An increase in state expenditures could result via twoscenarios. Some employees previously insured as a single, may chooseto cover their same-sex spouse; the State's contribution for healthbenefits would thereby increase. More, an employee may choose tocover their same-sex spouse's children. We estimate the change in theState's contributions, bearing both of these possibilities in mind.73.

Thus, weestimate that approximately 10.5 percent of Maryland's gay or lesbianpublic employees would add both a spouse and one or more children totheir health insurance, given the ability to marry. This is likely aconsiderable overestimation, as some of the children in the householdsof same-sex couples have likely been legally adopted by the non-biological parent. Consequently, even if the child was not theemployee's biological child, the employee could already be obtaininghealth insurance coverage for an adopted child. Nonetheless, we makethese assumptions in order to take into account the impact of movingfrom single coverage to coverage for an employee and two or moreadditional individuals, as the State's contribution in this case is largerthan if the employee adds only a spouse.To calculate the increase in the State's contributions, we havedetermined (1) the average annual state contribution for an employeeand one additional person and (2) the average annual state contributionfor an employee and two or more family members.78 We subtractedthese numbers from the average annual state contribution paid solelyon behalf of an employee. 79 The resulting figures indicate the increasein the annual state contribution resulting from either adding only aspouse to a medical plan, or from adding a spouse and one or morechildren.

By simply multiplying the total number ofemployees (69,113) and retirees (33,953) 83 receiving benefits by theupper and lower bounds of these rates (0.1 percent and 0.3 percent),we are able to determine the approximate number of employees whowould sign up a partner. The figure for active employees is thenmultiplied by 89.5 percent to determine the number of employees whowould add only a partner, and by 10.5 percent to determine the numberof employees estimated to add both a partner and one or morechildren; we do not repeat this process for retirees, given that theseindividuals are far less likely to have dependent children in the home.We then assume that the employees with benefits conferred to same-sex spouses would be spread across plans in the same way that currentemployees and retirees are distributed.Applying these principles, we multiply the number of spousesadded under each plan as a result of same-sex marriage by the increasein the average annual state contribution. If 0.3 percent of employeesand retirees with a health plan sign up a same-sex spouse or a same-sex spouse and child, we find that the total state contributions for alleight healthcare plans would increase by approximately $657,000 foractive employees and $284,800 for retirees. This would be the upperbound of the state contribution increase. If 0.1 percent of allemployees and retirees sign a same-sex partner up for a health plan,then the total state contributions for the eight healthcare plans wouldincrease by approximately $219,000 for active employees and $95,100for retirees. State contributions to healthcare costs could, therefore,increase by a total of about $313,800 to $941,900.that the spouse is also entitled to receive Medicare. Thus, we averaged the cost of the two statecontributions to obtain the state contribution for retirees.82. Michael Ash & M. V.

These proportions are lower than thepercentage of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people for several reasons: (1) not all LGB people arein couples; (2) some couples would not need coverage for a partner or spouse; and (3) somecouples will be discouraged from signing up a same-sex spouse or partner because of fear ofdisclosure or because of the taxation of those benefits.83.

Prescription CoverageMaryland offers employees a single choice in prescriptioncoverage. 84 We applied the same approach in determining the increasein state contributions to prescription plans as a consequence ofextending marriage to same-sex couples. The increase in the annualstate contribution resulting from adding a spouse to prescriptioncoverage is approximately $1,080, and is $1,646 for adding a spouseand children. A total of 65,162 active employees and 33,511 retireeswere enrolled in prescription plans in mid-2006. 85 Assuming that 0.3percent of all employees and retirees with a prescription plan makeadditions to their prescription plans (for active employees, throughadding either only a spouse or spouse and child), the annual statecontribution will increase by approximately $223,300 for activeemployees and $109,700 for retirees. If only 0.1 percent of employeesand retirees with a prescription plan sign up a same-sex partner orsame-sex partner and child, the cost for the State would increase byapproximately $74,400 for employees and $36,900 for retirees.Consequently, the total increase in state contributions to prescriptionplans would be between $111,400 and $333,000.C. Dental BenefitsTurning to dental benefits, Maryland offers three dental planchoices: two HMOs and one PPO. 86 The annual increase in stateexpenses resulting from adding a spouse to the dental plan ranges from$93 to $137, and from $181 to $377 for adding a spouse and children.Once again, we assume that all employees and retirees who choose tochange their coverage will be distributed among the plans in the sameway that current employees and retirees are distributed. A total of59,560 active employees and 18,358 retirees were enrolled in dentalplans in 2006.87 If 0.3 percent of employees with a dental plan sign upa same-sex spouse or spouse and children, the State's contributions todental plans would increase by $15,700 for employees and $11,100 forretirees.

As calculated by the average expenditure peremployee,88 Maryland spends approximately $520 million annually onthese three programs. Thus, at the upper end, adding same-sex partnercoverage would result in approximately a 0.25 percent increase toMaryland's total expenditures.

Survivor Benefits Under Maryland's Employee Retirement SystemsMaryland offers its employees four state-funded pension funds:the Retirement System for Employees and Teachers of the State ofMaryland (ERS/TRS), the Law Enforcement Officers Pension(LEOP), the State Police Retirement System (SPRS), and the Judges'Retirement System (JRS). 89 Active employees who are members ofany of the retirement systems receive a death benefit that is payable toa named beneficiary. This benefit consists of a single lump paymentthat is equal to the annual salary at death and all contributions made tothe plan. In the case of retired employees, electing a dual life annuity88.

Benefits paid for deaths outside the line of duty are included inthe following calculations, which estimate the effects of same-sexmarriage on state expenditures for spousal benefit plans.In 2006, Maryland paid $8,655,000 in pre-retirement deathbenefits. 98 Some of these payments are lump-sum payments made tosurvivors, including both spouses and non-spouses. These lump-sumpayments are currently available to same-sex partners. A portion ofthese expenditures, however, consists of payments made only tospouses under the monthly payment plans and/or the additional deathbenefits paid under LEOP and SPRS. We were unable to obtainseparate figures for these benefits from the State of Maryland;99 as aresult, we conservatively rely on the entire pre-retirement death benefitfigure to calculate the potential additional cost of permitting same-sexcouples to marry.By using the entire pre-retirement death benefit amount, wehave significantly overestimated the increase in state costs. This figureencompasses payments made under the lump-sum provisions, as wellas under the spousal death benefits. These lump-sum payments wouldnot increase as a result of same-sex marriage since same-sex partnersare already entitled to receive this benefit. Further, this figure is anoverestimation given that, with the exception of LEOP and SPRS, allof the spousal benefits merely dictate the method of payment to thespouse.10° As a result, the monthly payment plans only increase theamount of the State's expenditures by the difference in providing thispayment plan, as opposed to the lump sum. Further, under LEOP andSPRS, when there is no spouse to receive the special death benefits,then they are awarded to any children under the age of eighteen. Forsame-sex partners with children, therefore, the State already incurs thecost of paying the benefit. The State's additional costs resulting from97.

Applyingthe prior assumptions (as in the health benefits analysis) that anywherefrom 0.1 to 0.3 percent of employees would elect benefits for a same-sex partner, then Maryland's expenses for pre-retirement deathbenefits could increase by approximately $8,655 to $26,000. Giventhat this is an overestimation, the State's expenditures for all additionalspousal benefits would actually fall well below these amounts. Thisestimation, however, is quite small, suggesting that permitting same-sex partners to marry would have little impact on the State's retirementplan expenditures.A review of the survivor benefits under Maryland's pensionplans, therefore, indicates a minimal effect on the State's employeebenefit expenditures. Under all plans, employees can currently electtheir same-sex partner as a beneficiary. Further, under those plans thatoffer an additional spousal benefit, the additional cost of adding same-sex spouses would be so small as to render the effect unnoticeable.F. Offsetting the Costs of Same-Sex Spousal BenefitsOffering same-sex spousal benefits to public employees willlikely reduce the number of people who are uninsured or currentlyenrolled in Medicaid and other government-sponsored health careprograms. A recent study shows that people with unmarried partners-either same- or different-sex-are much more likely than marriedpeople to be uninsured or on Medicaid. 10 1 People in same-sexrelationships were twice as likely as married people to be uninsured;one in five such people are without health insurance. 10 2 The study alsofinds that if employers offer benefits to same-sex couples, some peoplewho are currently uninsured will become insured. Therefore, is theState is probably already responsible for at least some of the costsassociated with uncompensated care for the uninsured. 10 3 Similarly,some members of same-sex couples who receive Medicaid mightbecome eligible for a partner's state health insurance and will shift to101.

Both effects will tend to offset the cost of providingcoverage to the same-sex spouse of state employees.The State may also see lower costs associated with workerturnover from allowing state employees to marry their same-sexpartners and to enroll them in health benefit plans. A recent studyshows that the extension of domestic partner benefits has the effect ofreducing gay, lesbian, and bisexual employee turnover and increasingtheir commitment to employers.' °4 Same-sex marriage will logicallyhave the same effect on gay, lesbian and bisexual state employees.The State will be strengthened as an employer-and itsposition in the labor market bolstered-through the alignment of itscompensation policies with current practices of other Marylandemployers. As of March 1, 2006, 49 percent of the Fortune 500 and 78percent of the Fortune 100 largest corporations offered health benefitsto employees' same-sex partners, compared to just 25 percent of theFortune 500 in 2000.105This evidence suggests that giving same-sex couples the rightto marry will help the State compete for talented and committedemployees of all sexual orientations. As a result, some of the State'srecruitment and training costs may be reduced. Recruitment andturnover cost employers a lot, although the cost varies from job tojob. 106 These potential savings are likely to help offset some of theState's higher employee benefit costs, although it is not possible toestimate the savings precisely.104.

Access to Courts for Dissolution of Marriages Between Same-SexIndividualsDivorces of married same-sex couples would follow the samebasic procedures as those for different-sex couples. 10 7 As the numberof marriages increase in Maryland, the number of divorce filingsadded to the dockets of the Maryland Circuit Courts will slightlyincrease. In predicting the number of marriages between same-sexcouples that would dissolve each year, we have very little experienceto draw on. However, as noted earlier approximately one percent ofVermont's civil unions dissolved each year since 2000. If 7,800same-sex couples marry in Maryland and then dissolve at the samerate as those in Vermont, approximately seventy-eight married same-sex couples will divorce each year.Between 2001 and 2006, Maryland courts handled an averageof 36,960 divorce cases annually, 0 9 making the addition of seventy-eight same-sex marriage dissolutions insignificant. Not only wouldseventy-eight new divorce filings constitute a mere 0.2 percent of all107. Maryland offers two types of divorce-limited and absolute. See MD FAMILY LAWCODE § 7-102 (2007); MD FAMILY LAW CODE § 7-103 (2007). However, the only proceduresthat legally dissolve marriage are absolute divorce and annulment. Our analysis excludeslimited divorce because it does not legally sever the marital bonds. Granting a limited divorceauthorizes a spouse to live separate and apart from the other party and to obtain orders relatingto certain financial and custody issues but there is no severance of the marital bonds. Mostpeople who seek divorce in Maryland petition for absolute divorce, which officially ends themarriage.108. See Cummings, supra note 45.109.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSmore than 166,000 cohabitating same-sex couples. 128 As discussedearlier, we predict that half of the same-sex unmarried partners inthose states would wish to marry over the first three years afterissuance of marriage licenses starts in Maryland. 129 That means thateighty-three thousand same-sex couples from the District of Columbiaand these eight states, excluding New Jersey, would wish to marry.Because they cannot marry in their home states, these couples wouldhave to travel to Maryland in order to wed.Of course, the need to travel out of state and the fact that theirhome state may not honor a Maryland marriage would likely detersome same-sex couples from coming to Maryland to marry. We takethese deterrents into account in three ways. First, we focus on thestates where the travel deterrent would be the least-states that alreadysend a large number of tourists to Maryland and are within areasonable driving distance to the state. Second, we assume that onlyhalf of the couples in those states that wish to marry, or twenty-fivepercent of the total identified in the Census 2000, will actually travelto Maryland to get married. Third, we assume that only five percent ofcouples from the other forty states (excluding Massachusetts andRhode Island) would travel to Maryland to marry. We excludeMassachusetts because it is the only state that allows same-sex couplesto marry, as well as Rhode Island, since it is the closest state whosesame-sex couples are allowed to marry in Massachusetts.' 30  Wesee also Laura Mansnerus, Legislators Vote for Gay Unions in N.J., N.Y.

On July 18, 2007, the state'sregistrar of Vital Records and Statistics issued a notice indicating that a Supreme JudicialCourt ruling did not prohibit same-sex couples from New Mexico from marrying inMassachusetts. Nonetheless, we do not exclude New Mexico from our calculations of couples[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYinclude California, Washington, Oregon, Maine, Hawaii, NewHampshire, New Jersey, Vermont, and Connecticut in the five percentestimate because some same-sex couples in those states would likelychoose to marry for the additional practical value or symbolic meaningthat a domestic partnership or civil union lacks. Table 7 below showsthe breakdown of visitors by state.Table 7: Out-of-state same-sex couples who would travel to Maryland to marryNumber of Same-SexCouples Traveling toState Number of Same-Sex Maryland to Marry (25Couples percent for named states,5 percent for other 39states)Virginia 13,802 3,450Pennsylvania 21,166 5,291New York 46,490 11,622West Virginia 2,916 729North Carolina 16,198 4,049Delaware 1,868 467Florida 41,048 10,262Ohio 18,937 4,734District of Columbia 3,678 919Other 39 states (excluding 397,475 19,874MD, RI, and MA)TOTAL 563,578 61,397To arrive at the average tourist spending per out-of-statecouple, we use tourism data on Maryland that estimates averagespending per person at around $104 per day, including all expenses(lodging, meals, retail shopping, entertainment, and any other spendingrelated to their visit).' 3' Because Maryland requires a forty-eight-hourwaiting period between applying for and receiving a marriagelicense, 32we expect visiting couples from distant locations to stay atthat might choose to marry in Iowa, as we do Rhode Island. Couples in Rhode Island areunlikely to travel to Maryland to marry, given the proximity to Massachusetts. Those in NewMexico, however, are geographically closer to Maryland than to Massachusetts, and would notbe similarly deterred from traveling to Iowa to marry.131. See MARYLAND STATE TouRisM DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND THE OFFICE OF TOURISM,supra note 125, at 16 (the average tourist couple spent $353 on 1.7 days in Maryland(353/1.7=208; 208/2=$104 per day).132. See, e.g., supra note 115.2007]U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSleast two days. Therefore, we estimate that those more distant out-of-state couples will spend an several hundred dollars on basic expenses.Because of the proximity and size of Delaware, West Virginia, and theDistrict of Columbia, we assume that couples from those states willreturn home during the waiting period and will not spend money onthese additional tourist expenses.The second source of spending comes from weddingexpenditures, including spending on ceremonies, meals, parties,transportation, flowers, photographers, and other expenses. Accordingto The Wedding Report, a wedding industry research group, theaverage cost of a wedding in 2006 in the State of Maryland was$32,710.133 Because of the need to travel, we assume that out-of-statesame-sex couples would spend less than is spent on an in-statedifferent-sex couple's wedding, but that they would spend more thantypical tourists on special accommodations, meals, clothing, flowers,and gifts. We also expect additional spending by friends or familymembers who might accompany the couple, which is spending notincluded in the average wedding cost. Therefore, we conservativelyassume that the additional wedding spending by out-of-state coupleswill be one-tenth of the typical wedding expense, or $3,271.Accordingly, for couples from Delaware, West Virginia, andthe District of Columbia, we estimate wedding spending at $3,271; forcouples from farther or larger states we estimate total weddingspending and tourism spending at $3,687 per couple.' 34 The first fewlines of Table 8 show those figures multiplied by the number ofcouples from Table 7. The total spending by these 61,397 out-of-statecouples would be over $218 million. The increase in spending by out-of-state couples spread over three years is an increase of almostseventy-three million dollars per year.C. Wedding Spending by In-State CouplesAs noted earlier, Maryland has 15,607 resident same-sexcouples. 135 Again, we assume that fifty percent of these couples wouldchoose to marry. These 7,800 in-state couples are likely to have largercelebrations and spend more than out-of-state couples because their133. M.V. LEE BADGETr & GARY J.

See Gates, supra note 20.332 [VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYfriends and family are more likely to be local. However, due to societaldiscrimination, same-sex couples may receive less financial supportfrom their parents and other family members to cover wedding costs.Additionally, only spending that comes from couples' savings wouldtruly be \"new spending\" for the state's businesses, rather than moneydiverted from some other expenditure. Accordingly, we assume thatsame-sex couples will spend only twenty-five percent of the averageamount, or just under $8,200. The total for 7,800 couples would cometo over sixty-three million dollars in additional wedding spending inthree years, or a little over twenty-one million dollars per year.Table 8 adds the spending by in-state and out-of-state same-sexcouples to estimate a grand total of $282 million in wedding spendingover the first three years, or ninety-four million dollars per year.Table 8: Expenditures on Maryland weddings by same-sex couples in first threeyearsCouples Spending per Total Spending perMarrying in MD Couple State GroupWV, DE, and D.C. 2,115 $3,271 $6,918,000VA, NY, NC, OH, 39,408 $3,687 $145,297,000and PAOther States 19,874 $3,687 $73,275,000SUBTOTAL 61,397 - $218,573,000Maryland 7,800 $8,177.50 $63,785,000D. Other Economic Benefits of Same-Sex MarriageThe number of Maryland employers that offer healthcarebenefits for employees' same-sex partners is rising; however, there isno statewide registry for same-sex couples and no Maryland lawaffords same-sex couples rights based on their relationship at thistime. 136 Maryland employers could gain from same-sex marriage inother ways that could reduce labor costs, although it is not possible toprecisely calculate these effects. Given the general nature of some ofthese outcomes, it is possible that businesses will see the same positiveeffects of extending marriage to same-sex couples through equal136. See infra, app. A (contains a list of Maryland businesses that provide domesticpartner benefits).20071U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSprovisioning of benefits to same-sex and different-sex spouses. Onerecent report on this literature drew on the following conclusions: 137A supportive workplace climate and supportive policies,including domestic partner benefits, would increase disclosure (or\"coming out\") of lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees.' 3 8Disclosure has potentially positive benefits to workeremotional and mental health. Several studies find that people who aremore \"out\" report lower levels of anxiety and fewer conflicts betweenwork and personal life. 139Lesbian, gay, and bisexual workers who are out will be betterworkers. Several studies show that out workers report greater jobsatisfaction. 40 One study shows that participants who are more outreport sharing their employer's values and goals more than workerswho are more closeted. r41 Another study shows that more out workersreport higher levels of satisfaction with their co-workers. 142 Researchalso demonstrates that partner benefits reduce gay, lesbian, andbisexual workers' turnover and increase their commitment to firms.143Partly because of employer healthcare practices, people insame-sex relationships are almost twice as likely to be uninsured thanare married different-sex people, which could reduce the health care137.

OF COUNSELING PSYCHOL. 218 (1999).[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYand health of employees with same-sex partners. 144 Extendingmarriage to same-sex couples might improve worker health because anew social climate of equality, including greater access to health carebenefits, will promote employee openness and job satisfaction.Improved worker health may benefit employers through reducedabsenteeism and health care costs. Employers might also find it easierto retain and recruit lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees, sinceMaryland will be more attractive to such employees when comparedwith employers of other states that do not allow marriage for same-sexcouples. This competitive advantage could reduce training and hiringcosts. In addition, some heterosexual employees might also prefer towork in a state that demonstrates valuing family diversity bypermitting same-sex couples to marry, further benefitting Marylandemployers. 14 5E. Costs to BusinessesOnly two kinds of economic effects on Maryland employerscan be quantified: the added health care benefit costs and the addedbusiness revenue from weddings. Added health care costs are likely tobe quite manageable for Maryland businesses. A 2005 study predictsthat if all of Maryland's same-sex couples married, only 3,769 wouldend up signing up a new spouse for employer-provided health carebenefits. 14r If half marry, as we would expect, only 1,885 peoplewould sign up a new spouse. We can estimate the cost to employers ofeach of those new spouses from the 2005 Medical Expenditure PanelSurvey. 147 That government survey found that the average premiumfor individual coverage was $3,991 in 2005. 148 The addition of aspouse added $3,680 to the premium, with employers paying $2,644 ofthe higher amount. Inflating that figure to 2007 dollars results in anemployer cost of $3,027. Multiplying the added cost by the number ofnew spouses results in an estimated total increase of $5.7 million forall of Maryland's employers.144. See Ash & Badgett, supra note 82, at 588.145.

Id.2007] 335336 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASSWhile the gains from the less direct effects of extendingmarriage to same-sex couples are not explicitly quantifiable, the costsof recruiting, training, and hiring new employees are likely to be realconsiderations for most employers. Even without a good estimate ofthose financial effects, however, the net gain to Maryland employers isclear. The total health care costs estimated above were at most $5.7million per year, easily outweighed by the direct effect of over ninety-four million dollars in yearly wedding-related spending by out-of-stateand in-state couples during the first three years that marriage isextended to same-sex couples.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSUsing U.S. Census Bureau data on Maryland residents anddrawing on the experience of Massachusetts and other states, thisreport estimates the fiscal and economic effects of extending marriageto same-sex couples in Maryland.While the State will experience a significant increase in salestax revenue, Maryland will experience a loss in inheritance tax,income tax, and property transfer tax revenues, for a net gain of threemillion dollars in total tax revenue. The State will likely save over $1.5million in avoided public assistance expenditures by extendingmarriage to same-sex couples. Covering the health insurance of same-sex spouses of state employees and retirees will add between $435,000and $1.3 million to state expenditures. However, extending marriage tosame-sex couples will not generate administrative costs beyond thosealready covered by license fees. If same-sex couples are allowed tomarry, Maryland's wedding and tourism-related business sectors willsee a little over ninety-four million dollars per year in spending by in-state and out-of-state same-sex couples. Taking added health insurancecosts for businesses into account, the net gain to Maryland'sbusinesses is eighty-eight million dollars per year.Our analysis projects that giving equal marriage rights to same-sex couples will have a positive impact on the state budget of $3.2million per year and a net gain to state businesses of over eighty-eightmillion dollars per year during the first three years that marriage isextended to same-sex couples. The analysis shows that same-sexmarriage is not just good for same-sex couples but for the state budgetand economy too.[VOL. 7:2ALLOWING SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRYTable 9: Summary of fiscal im pact on state budgetTotal Fiscal EffectSales Tax $4,706,000Income Tax Revenue ($133,000)Inheritance Tax ($212,000)Transfer Tax ($1,375,000)Public Assistance $1,501,400Employment Benefits ($1,301,700)Administrative Costs $0TOTAL $3,185,700Appendix A 149Maryland Companies that Offer Domestic Partner ctyHealth BenefitsA A I Engineering Support Inc.
