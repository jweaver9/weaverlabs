BosUniversity of AmsterdamTheo G. M. SandfortNew York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia UniversityEddy H. de Bruyn and Esther M. HakvoortUniversity of AmsterdamThe authors examined whether 13- to 15-year-old adolescents who experience feelings of same-sexattraction (SSA) differ from those without such feelings in the quality of relationships with parents, peers,and class mentors and in psychosocial functioning (health status and school performance). The authorsalso assessed whether differences in psychosocial functioning resulted from differences in the quality ofsocial relationships. Data were collected from 866 Dutch high school students (mean age 13.61 years) bymeans of a computer-based questionnaire. Of the participants, 74 (8.5%) reported having feelings ofSSA. The participants with SSA rated the quality of their relationships with their fathers and their peerslower than did those without SSA. Participants with SSA also had poorer mental health (higher levels ofdepression and lower levels of self-esteem) and lower school performance. A mediation analysis revealedthat differences in psychosocial functioning resulted from differences in the quality of the same-sexattracted youths’ social relationships, especially with fathers and peers.Keywords: same-sex attraction, adolescents, psychosocial functioning, school performance, social rela-tionshipsThis study, carried out in the Netherlands, is one of the first toexplore the quality of the social networks of young adolescentswith same-sex attraction (SSA) and the associations between thatquality and psychosocial functioning. Various studies on socialnetworks and psychosocial functioning have been carried outamong older adolescents with SSA (e.g., Russell & Joyner, 2001;Russell, Seif, & Truong, 2001; Ueno, 2005), and among adoles-cents who self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) (e.g.,Fergusson, Horwood, & Beautrais, 1999; Garofalo, Wolf, Kessel,Palfrey, & Durant, 1998; Grossman & Kerner, 1998; Rosario,Rotherman-Borus, & Reid, 1996). These studies show that com-pared to their heterosexual counterparts, LGB adolescents are atrisk of impaired mental health and also do less well at school.These studies assessed a wide range of health problems, includinglow self-esteem, depression, substance use and abuse, suicideattempts or completed suicides, and engagement in sexual behav-iors that increase the risk of HIV infection (for an overview, seeAnhalt & Morris, 1998; Grossman, 2001; Rotheram-Borus &Langabeer, 2001). Similar findings were also found in the NationalLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (the “Add Health study;”Russell & Joyner, 2001; Russell et al., 2001). The Add Healthstudy is exceptional because it was based on a probability sample.Furthermore, instead of concentrating on sexual identity (self-identification as gay, lesbian, or bisexual), the study focused onSSA. Most other studies used convenience samples and focused onadolescents who had already identified themselves as gay or les-bian (Savin-Williams, 2005). Although we, too, focused on ado-lescents with SSA, our participants were younger than the AddHealth participants, who were aged between 12 and 19 years,increasing the likelihood that self-identification has not yet oc-curred.The higher prevalence of psychological adjustment problemsamong LGB youth is usually attributed to stigmatizing behaviorsby parents and peers to whom they have come out (for an over-view, see D’Augelli & Patterson, 2001). However, younger ado-lescents with SSA who have not yet come out and do not yetidentify as LGB are less likely to experience such stigmatizingbehavior. It is not known whether such young adolescents withSSA also have an elevated risk of developing psychosocial prob-lems. Furthermore, little is known about the processes underlyingthe relation between SSA and psychosocial problems. In contrastto the Add Health study, we also focused on the associationsbetween social networks and psychosocial functioning.

Several models have beenbuilt to describe this development (e.g., Cass, 1979; Troiden,1984). These models assume that sexual minority adolescents firstrecognize that they are different from their peers and then realizethat these feelings might be linked to their sexuality. In subsequentstages, adolescents give a name to their feelings, make their sexualstatus public, and finally are supposed to integrate their same-sexsexuality into their sense of self. It is frequently shown thathomosexual adults recall that during their adolescence they indeedfelt different from their same-sex peers, partly for the same reasonsas other adolescents (e.g., physical appearance, abilities, person-ality characteristics), but also because of their sex-atypical behav-ior and interests, including SSA (for an overview, see Savin-Williams & Cohen, 2007).In the present study, we examined social relationships andpsychosocial functioning (mental health and school performance)among high school students with and without SSA. The aim wasto focus on young adolescents who were in the phase of life inwhich SSA is first discovered. The average age at which LGByouth come out is 17 years (de Graaf, Meyer, Poelman, Vanwesen-beeck, 2005; Savin-Williams & Diamond, 2000). We surveyedstudents between the ages of 12 and 15 years.We hypothesized that young adolescents’ discovery of SSA andthe related sense of being different have a negative effect on thequality of their social networks. This is suggested by findings fromthe Add Health study. Russell and colleagues (Russell & Joyner,2001; Russell et al., 2001) showed that for adolescent girls withSSA, the quality of relationships with parents, peers, and teacherswas significantly lower than that of their peers who had hetero-sexual attraction. These girls with SSA also reported more nega-tive school outcomes. In boys, differences were less pronounced.If adolescents with SSA knew other sexual minority students, thesefriendships seemed to promote mental health and operate as abuffer against psychological distress (Ueno, 2005). Because themean age of the SSA adolescents in the Add Health study was15.81 years, it is likely that several of them had already come outand that the observed differences are a result of stigmatizingexperiences.It should be mentioned that the Netherlands, where the presentstudy was carried out, has a relatively open and tolerant socialclimate regarding homosexuality compared to other Western coun-tries, such as the United States (Sandfort, 2005; Waaldijk, 1993;Widmer, Treas, & Newcomb, 1998). We nevertheless expected tofind differences in mental health outcomes between youth with andwithout SSA, because children in the Netherlands do grow up withthe normative expectation of heterosexuality as the outcome ofone’s sexual development. Furthermore, recent large-scalepopulation-based studies among adults showed that compared toheterosexual people, homosexual men and women in the Nether-lands are at higher risk of psychiatric problems (Sandfort, deGraaf, Bijl, & Schnabel, 2001).Based on Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model (1979, 2005),which states that the quality of the adolescents’ social network(including relationships with parents, peers, and other adults, suchas class mentors at school) affects their psychosocial functioning,we hypothesized that the mental health and school performance ofyoung adolescents with SSA is impaired. Studies have found thatthe quality of the parent-child relationship is negatively related toproblem behavior (Anderson & Henry, 1994), depression (Green-berger, Chen, Tally, & Dong, 2000), academic achievement(Marchant, Paulson, & Rothlisberg, 2001), and grade point aver-age (GPA; de Bruyn, Deković, & Meijnen, 2003). According toStattin and Kerr (2000), the quality of parent-child communica-tion—such as the extent to which children spontaneously tell theirparents about what they find important and about the activitiesthey engage in with their friends, that is, disclosure—is a goodindicator of the quality of the parent-child relationship. Disclosureis a process that is jointly coconstructed by child and parent and islinked to higher academic skills, lower rates of delinquency, andexternalizing behavior (Sandstrom & Coie 1999). Although thequality of parent-child communication (disclosure) is a character-istic that is associated with a healthy development of children andadolescents, when children enter adolescence, it is often assumedthat parental influence decreases because of the rising influence ofpeers (Brown, Mounts, Lamborn, & Steinberg, 1993; Meeus &Deković, 995; Mounts & Steinberg, 1995). Some scholars arguethat the role of parents in the development of adolescents isoveremphasized (e.g., Harris, 1995, 1998): A growing body of datasuggests that peers, rather than the home environment, have lastingeffects on the psychological characteristics of adolescents (Allen,Donohue, Griffin, Ryan, & Mitchell-Turner, 2003).The relationship with class mentors might also affect adoles-cents’ functioning and well-being. In the Dutch secondary educa-tional system, all students have a class mentor. These mentors aremembers of the teaching staff and are responsible for individualstudents’ academic progress and socio-emotional well-beingthroughout the academic year. In the United Kingdom and theUnited States, in general, mentors are assigned only to childrenwho are in dire need of extra assistance or counseling (BaldwinGrossman, 1998; Sipe, 1996). In contrast, in the Netherlands allchildren are assigned a class mentor, regardless of individualpupils’ socio-emotional well-being or academic performance(Gieles, 1998; Verheul & Fiddelaers-Jaspers, 1996). A class men-tor is the first person to whom pupils (and parents) can turn ifproblems arise.In the present study, we assessed the quality of relationships ofyoung adolescents with SSA with their parents, peers, and classmentors and compared it with the quality of the relationships ofyoung adolescents without SSA. We expected that these twogroups would also differ in psychosocial functioning; in particular,we looked at mental health (depression and self-esteem) andschool performance (GPA and school identification). We expectedthe association between sexual attraction and psychosocial func-tioning to be mediated by the quality of the adolescents’ relation-ships with parents, peers, and class mentors.MethodsParticipantsThe sample comprised 479 boys (55.3%) and 387 girls; mostwere from middle-class families. The average age was 13.61 years(SD \u0001 .92 years). The ethnic composition of the sample was60 BOS, SANDFORT, DE BRUYN, AND HAKVOORT77.6% Dutch, 4.8% Surinamese, 4.4% Moroccan, 1.8% Turkish,and 9.9% other.ProcedureThe data used for this study originate from an ongoing projectcarried out by the University of Amsterdam to assess the determi-nants of school outcomes in young adolescents. Data for this studywere collected in early spring 2004 at four high schools in differentcities in the Netherlands. Before data collection started, the boardof each school had sent a letter to all parents containing informa-tion about the date, purpose, and nature of the study. Parents wereinformed that students would be asked about their feelings (e.g.,relationships with parents and romantic and sexual feelings) andthat class mentors would be asked to furnish the researchers withthe students’ GPAs. The letter made it clear to parents that studentparticipation in the study was voluntary. Parents could return theletter, indicating that they did not wish their child to participate inthe study. According to Dutch legislation, intuitional review boardapproval was not needed for conducting the study due to itsnonexperimental nature. The Netherlands Department of Educa-tion, Culture, and Sciences, which funded the study, approved theproposed study procedures. None of the parents refused to allowtheir child to participate.Research assistants administered the computer-based question-naire to individual students during quiet study periods in separateschool classes. Only students from Year 1 to Year 3 of high schoolhad been invited to participate. Students had been told that theirparticipation would be voluntary and that their answers would bekept confidential. In addition, each student’s assent was obtainedon the actual day of data collection. Prior to testing in the class-room, the students were reminded of the goals of the study and thevoluntary nature of their participation. All students present at thetime of data collection agreed to participate and subsequently filledout the questionnaire. If a student was ill or absent, the question-naire was administered at the next opportune moment.MeasuresSexual AttractionSexual attraction was assessed with the question “Do you feelsexually attracted to someone of your own sex?” (1 \u0001 very often,2 \u0001 often, 3 \u0001 frequently, 4 \u0001 sometimes, 5 \u0001 never), which hadbeen used in previous research on homosexual youth in the Neth-erlands (Kersten & Sandfort, 1994). Participants who reported thatthey never experience sexual attraction to someone of the same sexwere categorized as adolescents without SSA. Those who felt“very often,” “often,” “frequently,” or “sometimes” sexually at-tracted to someone of the same sex were categorized as adoles-cents with SSA (SA: 1 \u0001 no SSA, 2 \u0001 SSA).Social relationshipsParent-adolescent relationship. Disclosure to the parents wasassessed with the Adolescent Disclosure Measure (Stattin & Kerr,2000) separately for relationships with the father and the mother.This instrument includes five items for disclosure to the father andfive for disclosure to the mother (e.g., “Do you keep a lot of secretsfrom your father/mother about what you do during your freetime?”). The items have response categories ranging from 1 (\u0001never) to 4 (\u0001 always). Cronbach’s alphas for the father and forthe mother version of this scale were .83 and .84, respectively.Relationships with peers. We assessed two aspects that char-acterize the social position of adolescents among their peers,namely social acceptance among peers and peer role strain.Adolescents’ social acceptance among peers was assessed withthe Social Acceptance subscale of the Self-Perception Profile forAdolescents (Harter, 1982), which consists of five items. For eachitem, the respondent is first asked to decide what kind of personhe/she is most like: the person described on the left (e.g., “Somechildren are popular among their classmates”) or on the right (e.g.,“Some children are not popular among their classmates”). Therespondent is then asked whether the description is “sort of true”or “really true” for him/her. The answers are re-sorted on a scaleof 1 to 4, with a higher score indicating a higher level of socialacceptance. Cronbach’s alpha was just sufficient (\u0002 \u0001 .61). Tomeasure peer role strain, students completed a subscale of theEarly Adolescent Role Strain Inventory (Fenzel, 1989a, 1989b,2000), which is a 27-item scale that measures type and magnitudeof school-related role strains. It consists of four subscales, eachpertaining to a potential source of strain, that is, peers, school,teacher relations, and parent control. For the present study, onlythe peer role strain subscale (6 items) was used (de Bruyn, 2005).Students were asked to indicate for each item how frequently theirpeers expressed specific negative behaviors toward them (e.g.,“Classmates ignore me”: 1 \u0001 not at all, 5 \u0001 a lot). Cronbach’salpha was .74.Class mentor-adolescent relationship. The Respect subscaleof the Mentor Behavior Rating Scale (de Bruyn, 2004) was used toassess the adolescents’ perspective on the level of respect theyreceive from their class mentors. This subscale consists of 14items, each of which describes a specific class mentor behavior(e.g., “My class mentor treats me with respect” or “My classmentor is trustworthy”). The participants rated the frequency withwhich a class mentor showed each of the behaviors on a scaleranging from 1 (\u0001 seldom) to 6 (\u0001 almost always). Cronbach’salpha was .97.Mental Health StatusDepression. Adolescents’ feelings of depression were as-sessed using the depression scale of the General Health Question-naire (Goldberg, 1972). This scale consists of 14 symptoms ofdepression (e.g., “I feel sad, blue, and unhappy”). Participantswere asked to indicate on a 3-point scale the prevalence of thesesymptoms during the previous 6 months (1 \u0001 absent, 2 \u0001 some-times, 3 \u0001 frequently). Cronbach’s alpha was .86.Self-Esteem. To measure self-esteem, we administered theRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1979). This scale com-prises 10 items (e.g., “I take a positive attitude toward myself:”1 \u0001 strongly disagree, 4 \u0001 strongly agree). Cronbach’s alphawas .76.School PerformanceGPA. To measure the GPA, the average grade for the subjectsDutch, English, Biology, and Mathematics was computed. Theseaverage grades were provided by the class mentors.61SPECIAL SECTION: SAME-SEX ATTRACTION IN EARLY ADOLESCENCESchool identification. The Identification with School Ques-tionnaire (Voelkl, 1996a, 1996b) was used to measure the respon-dent’s feeling of belongingness in school. The scale consists of 16items (e.g., “School is one of my favorite places to be”). Partici-pants were asked to indicate their agreement with each statementon a 4-point scale (1 \u0001 strongly agree, 4 \u0001 strongly disagree).Cronbach’s alpha was good (\u0002 \u0001 .75).ResultsDescriptive AnalysesOf the 866 participants, 8.5% (N \u0001 74) were classified asexperiencing SSA. SSA was more prevalent among girls thanamong boys, 12.9% (n \u0001 50) and 5.0% (n \u0001 24), respectively(\u00032 \u0001 17.14, p \u0004 .001). The participants who reported SSA weresignificantly older than those who did not report SSA (M \u0001 14.05years, SD \u0001 1.01 years and M \u0001 13.57 years, SD \u0001 .91 years,respectively). No significant differences were found in the propor-tions of youth with SSA in relation to ethnic background. Giventhe diversity of the non-Dutch participants and the low percentagesof any single non-Dutch group, it was not possible to test fordifferences between these groups.Means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations between socialdemographic variables, social relationships variables, mentalhealth, and school performance are presented in Table 1.Sexual Attraction, Social Relationships, Mental Health,and School PerformanceA set of hierarchical regression analyses was conducted toexamine the relation between sexual attraction and social relation-ship variables (i.e., disclosure to mother and father, acceptanceamong peers, peer role strain, respect from class mentor). Age andgender (1 \u0001 boys, 2 \u0001 girls) were entered in Step 1, sexualattraction (1 \u0001 no SSA, 2 \u0001 SSA) was entered in Step 2, and theinteraction of Gender \u0005 Sexual Attraction and Age \u0005 SexualAttraction were entered in Step 3. Subsequent hierarchical regres-sion analyses were conducted to examine the relation betweensexual attraction and mental health (depression and self-esteem)and school performance (GPA and school identification).Social RelationshipsTable 2 presents the results of the hierarchical regression anal-yses with the independent variables age, gender (Step 1), sexualattraction (Step 2), and the interaction of Gender \u0005 Sexual Attrac-tion and Age \u0005 Sexual Attraction (Step 3) regressed on disclosureto mother and father, acceptance among peers, peer role strain, andrespect from class mentor. Inclusion of sexual attraction in Step 2produced a significant change in the coefficient of determination(\u0006R2) for disclosure to father, social acceptance, and peer rolestrain. The interaction terms (Gender \u0005 Sexual Attraction, andAge \u0005 Sexual Attraction) in Step 3 did not produce a significant\u0006R2 for any of the social relationship variables.Age, gender, and sexual attraction were independently related todisclosure to father, and accounted for 3% of the variance. Com-pared to older students, younger students scored higher on disclo-sure to their fathers. Boys disclosed less to their fathers than girlsdid. Adolescents with SSA also reported significantly less disclo-sure to their fathers. Social acceptance of peers was only signifi-cantly related to sexual attraction, with SSA adolescents havinglower levels of social acceptance. Sexual attraction accounted for 1%of the variance. Age, gender, and sexual attraction were significantlyrelated to peer role strain and accounted for 3% of the variance.Younger students showed less peer role strain than older students, andboys reported more peer role strain than girls did. Adolescents withSSA also reported more peer role strain (see Table 2).For disclosure to mother and respect from the class mentor,inclusion of sexual attraction in Step 2 did not produce a signifi-cant \u0006R2. Age and gender were significantly related to disclosureto the mother in Step 1 and accounted for 4% of the variance.Younger students disclosed more to their mothers than did olderstudents. Compared to girls, boys reported that they disclose less totheir mothers. Age accounted for 17% of the variance in respectfrom the mentors: Younger students had higher levels of respectfrom their class mentors (see Table 2).Table 1Intercorrelations, Means, and Standard Deviations Between Social Demographic Variables, Social Relationships Variables, MentalHealth, and School Performance1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.

Inclusion of sexual attrac-tion in Step 2 produced a significant \u0006R2 for depression, self-esteem, and school identification. However, inclusion of theinteraction terms (Gender \u0005 Sexual Attraction and Age \u0005 SexualAttraction) in Step 3 did not produce a significant \u0006R2 in any ofthe dependent variables (see Table 3).Age, gender, and sexual attraction were significantly related todepression, self-esteem, and school identification and accountedfor 15%, 11%, and 10% of the variance, respectively. Youngerstudents reported less depression and higher self-esteem than didthe older students, and their level of identification with school washigher compared to older students. Girls had significantly higherlevels of depression than boys did, and girls’ self-esteem wassignificantly lower than that of boys. School identification wassignificantly higher for girls than for boys. The adolescents withSSA reported significantly more depression and less self-esteem.These adolescents also scored significantly lower on school iden-tification.For GPA, inclusion of sexual attraction in Step 2 did notproduce a significant \u0006R2. Gender was significantly related toGPA in Step 1, and accounted for 1% of the variance. Figuresindicate that the GPA for boys was significant lower than it was forgirls.Mediation ModelIn order to test the hypothesis that differences in mental healthand school performance between young adolescents with andwithout SSA result from differences in the quality of their socialrelationships, we followed the guidelines for mediation analysissuggested by Baron and Kenny (1986). For the presence of asignificant mediating pathway, several conditions must be met.There must be significant relations between: (a) the independentvariable (sexual attraction) and the dependent variable (mentalhealth and school performance); (b) the independent variable (sex-ual attraction) and the potential mediators (social relationships);and (c) the potential mediators and the dependent variables. Sup-port for our hypothesis would be found if the role of sexualattraction (the independent variable) in the explanation of mentalhealth and school performance (the dependent variables) were todisappear or be significantly reduced by introducing the socialrelationship variables (see Baron & Kenny, 1986).We have already demonstrated that conditions (a) and (b) aremet: sexual attraction (independent variable) was related to (a)depression, self-esteem, and school identification (dependent vari-ables) and (b) disclosure to father, peer role strain, and socialacceptance. We conducted three multiple regression analyses, onefor each outcome variable that was significantly related to sexualattraction, to examine the independent contribution of the socialrelationships variables in the explanation of mental health andschool performance (see Table 4). In these analyses, we controlledfor age and gender.Social acceptance among peers and peer role strain were foundto make significant independent contributions to the explanation ofvariance in depression.

Acceptance among peers and peer role strain werestrong predictors of depression, self-esteem, and school identifi-cation. For self-esteem and school identification, disclosure tofather was also a strong predictor (see Table 5). These resultsestablish social acceptance and peer role strain as mediators of therelation between sexual attraction and depression.The bootstrapping method test for multiple mediations recom-mended by Preacher and Hayes (2004) provided further supportfor this mediation (social acceptance: z \u0001 2.29, p \u0004 .05, confi-dence interval (CI) 95%: low: .00, high: .05; peer role strain: z \u00012.68, p \u0004 .05, CI 95%: low: .01, high: .05). Subsequently, disclo-sure to father, social acceptance, and peer role strain were signif-icant mediators of the effect of sexual attraction on self-esteem andschool identification. The outcome of the bootstrapping methodtest for multiple mediations supported the finding for this media-tion on self-esteem (disclosure to father: z \u0001 –2.18, p \u0004 .05, CI95%: low: –.03, high: –.01; social acceptance: z \u0001 –2.82, p \u0004 .05,CI 95%: low: –.04, high: –.01; peer role strain: z \u0001 –1.82, p \u0004 .05,CI 95%: low: –.04, high: –.01) and school identification (disclo-sure to father: z \u0001 –2.30, p \u0004 .05, CI 95%: low: –.07, high: .00;social acceptance: z \u0001 1.81, p \u0004 .05, CI 95%: low: –.05, high: .00;peer role strain: z \u0001 –1.99, p \u0004 .05, CI 95%: low: –.05, high: .00).DiscussionOur study among a sample of students (mean age 13.61) at fourhigh schools in different cities in the Netherlands revealed differ-ences in the quality of social relationships (disclosure to father,social acceptance among peers, peer role strain), mental health(depression, self-esteem) and school performance (school identi-fication) between young adolescents with SSA and those withoutsuch feelings. Although we expected the effects of the interactionbetween Gender \u0005 Sexual Attraction and Age \u0005 Sexual Attractionon mental health and school performance to be significant, this wasnot supported by our findings.Our findings further indicate that differences in depression,self-esteem, and school identification between young adolescentswith and without SSA are an outcome of the expected lowerquality of the social relationships of same-sex attracted adolescentswith their fathers and peers. Compared to adolescents withoutSSA, adolescents with SSA had more mental health problems aswell as more school problems, suggesting that disparities in mentalhealth and school performance are related to sexual orientation.The relation between sexual attraction and mental health has beendocumented in adults (see for instance, Cochran, Sullivan, &Mays, 2003; Sandfort et al., 2001). Our study suggests that differ-ences might already be present at a much earlier age.The pattern of our findings is in line with studies that focused onmore dire psychological differences (such as suicidal behavior)between adolescents who identified as LGB and adolescents whoidentified as heterosexual (D’Augelli, Hershberger, & Pilkington,2001). Diamond and Lucas (2004) also found higher levels ofdepression in gay-identified and lesbian-identified adolescents.Adolescents with SSA might be more depressed or show lowerlevels of self-esteem because they worry about whether they willever find a romantic partner (Diamond & Lucas, 2004). It mightalso be that they have doubts about ever having a normal family oftheir own, or that they expect that they will always feel differentfrom their peers.These factors may cause some depression and low self-esteemeven if the children’s relationship with family, peers, and mentorare not adversely affected by feeling of same-attraction. Our find-ings regarding less strong feelings of school identification mightbe an indicator of more general school problems. In this sense, ourresults are in line with what Russell and colleagues (Russell &Joyner, 2001; Russell et al., 2001) found regarding SSA adoles-cents. However, these authors also found differences in GPA: Girlswith a homosexual attraction and boys with a bisexual orientationhad lower GPAs. We did not find this in our study.Adolescents with SSA also differed from adolescents withoutSSA on three of the six potential determinants of mental health andschool performance: Two were related to the adolescents’ relation-ships with peers (social acceptance among peers and peer rolestrain), the third to the relationship with their fathers (disclosure tofather).We found differences between adolescents with and withoutSSA only in the relationship with fathers and not with mothers. Itcould be that, in general, it is more difficult for adolescents to talkto their fathers about their feelings and personal life than it is todiscuss these issues with their mothers. It might even be moredifficult for adolescents who feel sexually attracted to someone ofTable 5Multiple Regression Analyses for Social Relationships and Same Sex Attraction (SSA) Predicting Mental Health and SchoolPerformanceDepression Self-Esteem School identificationB SE \b B SE \b B SE \bAge in years .03 .02 .05 \u0007.04 .02 \u0007.06 \u0007.19 .03 \u0007.23***Gender .20 .02 .30*** \u0007.21 .02 \u0007.31*** .10 .03 .13***Disclosure to father — — — .11 .02 .19*** .19 .02 .30***Social acceptance \u0007.14 .02 \u0007.24*** .18 .02 .29*** .07 .03 .09*Peer role strain .12 .02 .24*** \u0007.05 .02 \u0007.10*** \u0007.06 .02 \u0007.09*Sexual attraction \u0007.20 .04 .16*** .01 .04 \u0007.01 .06 .05 \u0007.05R2 .30 .29 24F 75.06*** 45.34*** 35.15***Note.

It should be mentionedthat in terms of the parent–child relationship, we assessed theextent to which children spontaneously disclose to their parentswhat they find important. It might be interesting for future researchto also include other aspects of the parent–child relationship.Parental warmth and support, for instance, might be importantaspects with respect to highly sensitive and secretive issues, suchas feelings of SSA.Although we did not find differences between adolescents withSSA and without SSA in the quality of the relationships with classmentors, there were differences regarding their relationships withpeers. Adolescents with SSA rated their relationships with peersless positively than did adolescents without SSA. The fact that anadolescent feels less socially accepted by peers and experiencesmore peer role strain, might be related to his/her feeling differentfrom peers or being less accepted by peers because of his/her SSA.Several studies have shown that LGB people often recall havingstrong feelings of SSA and same-sex fantasies during their earlyadolescence, accompanied by uneasiness about feeling differentfrom their peers (Savin-Williams & Cohen, 2007; Schneider,2001). However, these studies were based mainly on retrospectivereports after people had come out. The present study suggests thatsuch feelings are present in the precoming-out phase. SSA ado-lescents’ negative relationships with peers could also result fromhomophobic responses. We do not know, though, whether peerswere aware of the feelings of SSA that some of the participantshad. Gender nonconformity could also be an explanation for ourfinding that more negative experiences with peers were reportedby adolescents with SSA. If gender nonconformity is visible topeers, adolescents with SSA may be shunned by them. Higherlevels of gender atypicality among adolescents with SSA mightlead to loss of protection by the group, and therefore to negativeconsequences for psychological adjustment (Yunger, Carver, &Perry, 2004). It could also be that fathers are less accepting ofgender nonconformity and that, as a result, SSA adolescentsshowed less disclosure to their fathers. Some prudence is requiredregarding these interpretations, however, because we did not as-sess gender nonconformity.As expected, the association between sexual attraction and psy-chosocial functioning and school performance was partly mediatedby the quality of the adolescents’ social relationships with peers.This is in line with the finding of Safren and Heinberg (1999),namely that the low satisfaction of LGB people with social supportfrom their peers mainly accounted for high depression and hope-lessness. In addition, Diamond and Lucas (2004) show that worriesabout friendships and about never finding a romantic friend me-diated differences in health outcomes between LGB and hetero-sexual youths. These are important findings, particularly becauseprevious research has paid little attention to the role of peerrelationships and the potential causes of poorer health and schoolperformance among LGB youths.This study has a few limitations. First, we focused on SSA as anindicator of sexual orientation, and other dimensions of sexualorientation (such as self-labeling or behavior) were not assessed. Itis not clear, however, whether all the participants with SSA willlater engage in same-sex sexuality and develop a gay or lesbianidentity. We also do not know to what extent the SSA students hadalready come out to parents, peers, or class mentors. As a conse-quence, we could not assess whether differences in social relation-ships and psychosocial functioning were related to whether or notstudents had made their sexual status public. Second, all thesimilarities and differences described in this paper are based onadolescents’ self-reports (with the exception of the GPAs). Third,Cronbach’s alpha for the peer acceptance scale was quite low. Itcould be that information from other sources (e.g., peers, teachers,parents) and other instruments (e.g., observations) would haveresulted in a different assessment of their social relationships.Using peer ratings of a youth’s popularity would be anotheralternative (cf. de Bruyn & Cillessen, 2006). Fourth, the study didnot have a longitudinal design. With a longitudinal design, itwould be possible to assess whether students with an SSA alsodevelop an LGB identity and whether SSA in early adolescence isrelated to the quality of the social networks and psychosocialfunctioning in later adolescence. Longitudinal designs might alsorule out the possibility that the direction of the relationship withpeers and parents on the one hand and mental health and schoolperformance in the other hand is in the opposite direction of whatwe posited here.Finally, the generalizability of the findings is limited becausethe study was carried out in the Netherlands, where the socialacceptance of homosexuality is higher than it is in the UnitedStates. However, even in this more tolerant climate there aredifferences between young adolescents with and without SSA.Our findings underscore the importance of studying the men-tal health and school performance of adolescents with SSAfrom the perspective of their multiple social relationships, es-pecially their relationships with peers and parents. Longitudinalstudies would make it possible to assess how the observeddisparities develop over time, in relation to adolescents’ furthersexual development.ReferencesAllen, M., Donohue, W.

Developmental Psychol-ogy, 40, 572–582.Received September 28, 2006Revision received July 24, 2007Accepted September 26, 2007 \u0001Call for Papers:Special Section on Three-Generation Research on Parentingand Its ConsequencesDevelopmental Psychology invites manuscripts for a special section on three-generation researchon parenting and its consequences to be compiled by guest editors Rand Conger, Jay Belsky, andDeborah Capaldi working together with Associate Editor Richard Lerner.The goal of the special section is to highlight recent high quality, prospective, longitudinalresearch on intergenerational continuities and discontinuities in parenting behavior and theirconsequences for child and adolescent development. Topics might include, but are not limited to,examination of the following:• Mediating mechanisms that link quality of parenting in one generation to quality of parentingin the next,• Social or personal events or conditions that either reduce or increase (i.e., moderate) the degreeof intergenerational continuity in the quality of parenting behavior,• Factors that disrupt intergenerational continuity in abusive parenting,• The role of continuity in parenting as a nexus for similar developmental trajectories of childrenor adolescents in one generation and their children in the next generation, and• Methodological issues related to the study of intergenerational continuity in parenting and itsconsequences.Especially welcomed are papers that report the results of research on understudied populations suchas ethnic minorities or rural as well as urban parents and children. The submission of recentlycompleted doctoral dissertations is also encouraged.The submission deadline is February 1, 2008. Initial inquiries regarding the special section maybe sent to Rand Conger at rdconger@ucdavis.edu, Jay Belsky at j.belsky@bbk.ac.uk, or DeborahCapaldi at deborahc@oslc.org. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically through the Manu-script Submission Portal of Developmental Psychology at http://www.apa.org/journals/dev.html.Please be sure to specify in the cover letter that your submission is intended for the special section.For instructions to authors and other detailed submission information, see the journal website athttp://www.apa.org/journals/dev.html.68 BOS, SANDFORT, DE BRUYN, AND HAKVOORT",

    "abstract": "The study assessed the extent to which children between eight and 12 years old in planned lesbian families in the Netherlands experience stigmatization, as well as the influence of protective factors (relationship with parents, social acceptance by peers, contact with children from other families headed by lesbian mothers or gay fathers) on their psychological adjustment (conduct problems, emotional symptoms, hyperactivity, self-esteem). Data were collected by questionnaires filled out by the mothers and by the children themselves. The children in the sample generally reported low levels of stigmatization. However, boys more often reported that, in their view, they were excluded by peers because of their non-traditional family situation. Girls more often reported that other children gossiped about the fact that they had two lesbian mothers. Higher levels of stigmatization were associated with more hyperactivity for boys and lower self-esteem for girls. Having frequent contact with other children who have a lesbian mother or gay father protects against the negative influence of stigmatization on self-esteem. Findings support the idea that children in planned lesbian families benefit from the experience of meeting other children from similar families",
