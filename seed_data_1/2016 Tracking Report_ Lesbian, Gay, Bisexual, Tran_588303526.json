For LGBTQ philanthropy, the year 2016 was one of change, hardship, and inspiration.It was the first year after the freedom to marry became the law of the land in the United States and saw a sharp rise of anti-LGBTQ bills across the country. 2016 also saw the most violent attack on the LGBTQ community in our history—the massacre at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida. This massacre was followed by an outpouring of support from corporations, foundations, and individuals, which ultimately raised more than $30 million to support the victims, their families, and the healing and empowerment of all the communities affected. This inspiring giving—much of it channeled through the OneOrlando Fund for direct support of victims and families—was, to our knowledge, the largest single fundraising campaign and philanthropic effort in the history of LGBTQ philanthropy. 2This report provides a detailed summary of the scope and character of foundation funding for LGBTQ issues in calendar year 2016. This 15th annual edition of the tracking report captures data on 6,032 grants awarded by 348 foundations, making it the most comprehensive assessment of LGBTQ funding available. Largely buoyed by the massive outpouring of support in the wake of the Pulse tragedy, LGBTQ funding soared to a record high of $202.3 million in 2016—a growth of more than $41 million or more than 25 percent from 2015, the largest raw year-over-year increase in the history of LBGTQ funding. When the somewhat exceptional case of giving through the OneOrlando Fund is excluded, LGBTQ funding for the year totaled $172.8 million—a more modest 6 percent increase over 2015, which is also more consistent with recent year-to-year growth in LGBTQ funding.In several sections of this year’s report, we provide two sets of figures: one that includes funding from the OneOrlando Fund and one that does not. In gathering and analyzing data for this year’s report, we recognized that it was crucial to capture and understand the scope of giving in response to the Pulse tragedy, a crucial moment in the history of the LGBTQ movement and LGBTQ philanthropy. At the same time, like much disaster giving, the vast majority of giving related to the Pulse massacre was tightly limited in both scope and time. In particular, all of the OneOrlando’s $29.5 million in 2016 grantmaking was used to provide much-needed direct financial assistance to survivors and family members of those taken from us by the massacre. Much of this funding also came from individuals inspired to give by the tragedy--giving that is unlikely to repeat in the same way or at the same level in future years. Total funding from OneOrlando in 2016 was also so large (15 percent of all LGBTQ giving for the year) that it easily skews any overall data analysis in a number of categories, such as giving for LGBTQ Latinx communities or addressing violence in LGBTQ communites. Given that, we felt that regularly providing data both with and without OneOrlando Fund was the most accurate and complete way to tell the story of LGBTQ philanthropy in 2016.The historic rise in LGBTQ funding in 2016 is an inspiring one, and my heart stirs even now as I reflect on the foundation funders and individual donors from around the world who came together to support our community in a moment of tremendous loss and need. In the past year, as we have continued to work with funders and community partners in Orlando, even as dollars have already begun to taper off, it is clear that there is still much to be done to complete the journey of healing and empowerment for our communities in Orlando and around the world. The inspiring story of how the world came together in a moment of great need for LGBTQ communities is also a reminder of the vast needs and challenges that still face our communities daily, albeit quietly and with less media attention. As a caveat, remember that this report only includes funding from foundations and corporations—not from individual donors or government agencies—and as such only captures a portion of all giving to LGBTQ issues. Note that the global section of this year’s report once again only provides a brief summary, since we will provide more detailed information on funding for LGBTQ issues internationally and outside the U.S. in the Global Resources Report, our biennial report series produced in collaboration with the Global Philanthropy Project. The next edition of that report will cover calendar years 2015-2016 and, as I write this, is in the final phases of production.It is my hope that this report continues to prove useful to funders, nonprofit leaders, and other stakeholders in identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities for LGBTQ grantmaking. As with all of our research, our goal is to provide accurate and user-friendly data on LGBTQ funding, so as to advance our mission of increasing the scale and impact of LGBTQ philanthropy.Sincerely,Ben Francisco Maulbeck President, Funders for LGBTQ IssuesIntroduction4CONTENTSOVERVIEW 5Top Grantmakers 9Top Grant Recipients 10Sources of LGBTQ Funding 11Geographic Focus 12Type of Support 13Population Focus 14Strategies Funded 15Issues Addressed 16THE PHILANTHROPIC RESPONSE TO THE PULSE TRAGEDY 6DOMESTIC FUNDING OF LGBTQ ISSUES 17Local, State, and Regional Funding of LGBTQ Issues 19Funding Per LGBT Adult 23Issues Addressed in Domestic Funding 26Domestic Population Focus 27DOMESTIC FUNDING BY TYPE OF ORGANIZATION 31LGBTQ Organizations vs. Non-LGBTQ Organizations 31Breakdown of Domestic Funding for LGBTQ Organizations 32Breakdown of Domestic Funding for Non-LGBTQ Organizations 34GLOBAL FUNDING FOR LGBTQ ISSUES 36Global LGBTQ Funding By Region and Issues Addressed 37Global Funding by Location of Grantee 39COMMUNITY FOUNDATION GRANTMAKING FOR LGBTQ ISSUES  41CORPORATE GRANTMAKING FOR LGBTQ ISSUES 42PRIVATE FOUNDATION GRANTMAKING FOR LGBTQ ISSUES 43PUBLIC FUNDER GRANTMAKING FOR LGBTQ ISSUES 44Appendix: 2016 List of LGBTQ Grantmakers in the U.S. 45Methodology & Acknowledgments 55IntroductionFoundation funding for LGBTQ issues reached a record high of $202.3 million in 2016, at a significantly increased rate of growth of 25 percent.Total Annual LGBTQ Grant Dollars, 2006-2015*Inflation numbers are based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index.$50,000,000$100,000,000$150,000,000$200,000,000$250,000,00020162015201420132012201120102009200820072006Nominal dollars (not adjusted)2016 dollars (adjusted for inflation)200720082009201020112012201320142015$80,295,279$116,181,019$96,533,298$96,829,756$123,012,423$121,412,490$129,112,119$153,248,693$160,702,984$92,945,129$129,511,701$107,993,806$106,577,298$131,252,662$126,919,029$133,019,451$155,366,142$162,730,27320162016 (without One-Orlando grantmaking)$202,312,772 $202,312,772$172,802,772OVERVIEWIn 2016, United States-based foundations and corporations awarded 6,032 grants totaling $202.3 million to support organizations and programs addressing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer issues. Both the total dollar amount and the total number of grants are new historic highs for LGBTQ grantmaking. Compared to 2015, LGBTQ funding grew by $41.6 million, or an increase of nearly 25 percent—the sharpest rise in LGBTQ funding in the past decade.Much of the $41.6 million increase is related to funds raised and disbursed in response to the Pulse massacre. Specifically, the OneOrlando Fund raised and distributed nearly $30 million in 2016 to provide direct financial support for approximately 300 survivors and family members of victims of the shooting. The philanthropic response to the shooting accounts for approximately three-quarters of the year’s increase. Much of this funding was time-limited and came from individual donors inspired to give by the tragedy, and is therefore unlikely to be sustained in future years. However, the response to Pulse also engaged a number of corporations and foundations in giving to LGBTQ communities for the first time, some of whom may remain involved in LGBTQ philanthropy in future years. A more detailed review and analysis of grantmaking related to the Pulse shooting is provided in the special spotlight section on page 6.Without the new funding related to the Orlando relief effort, LGBTQ grantmaking grew by about $12.1 million, or 7.5 percent—a more modest increase that is similar to the growth of the prior year. This increase was largely due to a number of long-standing, leading LGBTQ funders increasing their total annual LGBTQ grantmaking. Specifically, the Arcus Foundation, Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund, and anonymous funders each increased their LGBTQ funding by $1 million to $5 million. Several funders that had previously decreased their LGBTQ funding saw a resurged increase in their total LGBTQ funding in 2016: the Ford Foundation, Gilead, and Open Society Foundations each increased their LGBTQ funding by amounts ranging from $1.5 million to $5.4 million.These increases were offset by a handful of notable declines. In particular, amfAR decreased its LGBTQ funding by more than $1.6 million, a result of the closure of its grantmaking portfolio focused on gay men and transgender people.t l al L T  rant Dollars, 2006 –2016On June 12, 2016, a gunman attacked Pulse Nightclub, a gay club in Orlando, Florida, taking 49 lives, wounding 68 others, and forever changing the lives of countless more. It was Latin night, and the majority of victims and survivors were LGBTQ and Latinx.In the days and months that followed, a variety of institutions mobilized in response to the tragedy. Governments, individuals, foundations, and corporations all raised funds and moved resources to address several immediate and long-term needs: direct assistance for survivors and victims’ families; mental health services and other social services; and the long-term healing and empowerment of the LGBTQ and Latinx communities most affected by the tragedy. By the end of the year, more than $30 million had been raised in response to the tragedy—the largest fundraising campaign in history for a cause related to LGBTQ communities. The scale of resources mobilized was so large that it helped fuel a record-breaking 25 percent increase in the year’s total overall LGBTQ grantmaking. This special section is intended to provide a brief overview of the resources raised, the philanthropic vehicles used, the funders that contributed, and the ongoing challenges and gaps that the tragedy brought to light.THE PHILANTHROPIC RESPONSE TO THE  PULSE TRAGEDYDirect Support for Survivors and Victims’ FamiliesWithin hours of the news of the Pulse shooting, people around the world were moved to generously give in response. Over the course of the following weeks and months, several vehicles were established to channel financial assistance directly to the survivors and the families of the victims, with various nonprofits, agencies, and funders playing key roles in facilitating the flow  of resources.• Several fundraising campaigns were launched on GoFundMe and other online crowdsourcing platforms. Most notable, Equality Florida Education Fund, the LGBTQ advocacy organization for the state of Florida, established a GoFundMe campaign that ultimately raised more than $11 million. Pulse of Orlando, the GLBT Center of Central Florida, and other organizations and individuals established similar campaigns.• The City of Orlando established the OneOrlando Fund, which was housed at the 501(c)(3) organization known as Strengthen Orlando and became the primary vehicle for raising funds for direct support of the survivors and the victims’ families. Nearly all dollars raised in the immediate aftermath of the Pulse massacre were devoted to direct assistance, made possible by generous donations from thousands of donors from around the world. In an effort to streamline the distribution process, the funds raised by Equality Florida and other GoFundMe campaigns were ultimately coordinated through the OneOrlando Fund and administered by the National Center for Victims of Crime’s National Compassion Fund (more details below). The Fund distributed more than $29 million by the end of 2016, followed by additional smaller disbursements in 2017, all of it devoted to supporting nearly 300 individuals who were physically present at the nightclub at the time of the shooting or who lost a loved one to the massacre.• A number of corporations, including several based in Central Florida, made large contributions to the OneOrlando Fund. Notably among them, Comcast NBCUniversal, Darden Restaurants, the Walt Disney Company, Orlando City Soccer Club Foundation, and Publix Super Markets Charities each gave $500,000 or more to the Fund.• The National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC) a national nonprofit organization with experience managing funds in response to September 11 and other tragic attacks, was contracted to manage the distribution of the funds raised through OneOrlando and other vehicles. Several leading national LGBTQ funders provided funding to cover NCVC’s administrative costs, allowing all other funds raised to be fully devoted to direct financial assistance for survivors and victims’ families.• Orlando Health and Florida Hospital, located a few hundred meters from the Pulse Nightclub, was the hospital that provided emergency medical care for all those injured in the shooting. The hospital waived all medical bills for those wounded that night—including a number of extensive follow-up surgeries—a value of more than $5.5 million in healthcare.Mental Health and Other Social ServicesThe Pulse shooting created trauma that took an emotional and physical toll on thousands in the metro-Orlando and surrounding communities. This led to a regional mental health crisis and the urgent need for a variety of culturally and linguistically competent mental health services and other social services—both for the survivors and for the wider community affected by the tragedy. Several funders and agencies worked in tandem to address these needs:• The Heart of Florida United Way, in partnership with the City of Orlando and Orange County Government, created the Orlando United Assistance Center, which became the primary hub for coordinating services and providing case management to help people access a range of services and resources. • The Central Florida Foundation established the Better Together Fund, which leveraged resources from a number of individual donors, corporations, and foundations. The Fund has played a key role in addressing gaps in social services related to Pulse. For example, the Foundation convened and funded mental health providers, with a focus on improving the area’s linguistic and cultural competence. The Fund also provided early gap funding through the United Way, providing direct financial relief for survivors and families in the interim period before OneOrlando Fund funding was disbursed.• Several local nonprofit organizations and grassroots efforts addressed key needs, including the GLBT Center of Central Florida, Proyecto Somos Orlando, QLatinx, and Two-Spirit Health Services. • Government dollars and resources were also brought to bear, with the Department of Justice providing $8.4 million and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) providing $500,000 in federal grants to support social services to Pulse-affected communities. The Department of 2016 Tracking Report7Justice grant is being coordinated the Florida Attorney General’s office, and the SAMHSA grant is being coordinated by the Florida Department of Children and Families and Central Florida Cares, Inc., with the Orlando United Assistance Center serving as lead service provider for both. The City of Orlando fronted the initial funding for delivery of crucial social services while the federal grants were in process. Orange County also contributed in several ways, including the donation of the space for the Orlando United Assistance Center.Community Healing, Education, and EmpowermentBeyond immediate social service needs, the Pulse tragedy also created a need for longer-term community healing. Moreover, the tragedy brought to light the long-standing inequities faced by the region’s LGBTQ and Latinx communities and other communities of color. Several local and national funders contributed to efforts to address these challenges through community healing, education, and empowerment:• In the weeks following the tragedy, Funders for LGBTQ Issues led a philanthropic assessment to elucidate the unique needs and assets of the region’s LGBTQ and Latinx communities in the wake of the tragedy. The assessment found that there were a number of strong LGBTQ and Latinx community leaders and burgeoning grassroots efforts, but a lack of formalized nonprofit infrastructure, as well as gaps in culturally competent services and spaces for community-building and empowerment.• The Arcus Foundation and several other national funders contributed dollars for the establishment of the Contigo Fund, which focused on the unique needs of the region’s LGBTQ and Latinx communities in the aftermath of the shooting. Housed at Our Fund Foundation, the Fund built on the Funders for LGBTQ Issues assessment and developed a grantmaking model driven by a panel of leaders representing the communities most affected by the shooting. The Fund’s community-driven and rapid response grantmaking quickly helped seed and grow new organizations such as QLatinx, which works to empower young LGBTQ Latinx communities. Contigo also provided support for various projects working to strengthen movements led by and for LGBTQ Black and immigrant communities, Muslims, those affected by HIV/AIDS, transgender women of color, and other vulnerable populations, so as to build on the transformative work taking root across Central Florida.• The Better Together Fund, in addition to its support for social services, has provided grants to help foster increased awareness and understanding across differences, particularly in faith communities.  In partnership with Contigo, the Fund also supported the OneOrlando Alliance, a new coalition of LGBTQ organizations providing a collective voice for Central Florida’s LGBTQ communities.• The One Pulse Foundation, founded by Pulse owner Barbara Poma, is leading several projects, including the establishment of a permanent memorial at the site of the Pulse Nightclub.The array of resources deployed in immediate response to the Pulse massacre was staggering, and there was and continues to be an exceptional degree of coordination and collaboration across institutions and sectors. Orlando has demonstrated a number of promising practices for philanthropic responses to violent attacks, such as designating liaisons for communication across key funding institutions and including leaders from most affected communities in decision-making bodies for grants allocation. Unfortunately, these promising practices are likely to be needed again in the months and years to come. As shootings and natural disasters continue to plague the nation, LGBTQ communities and other vulnerable communities are likely to be explicitly targeted and uniquely affected. The conditions in Central Florida – an under-resourced infrastructure for LGBTQ communities, especially LGBTQ communities of color – are similar to the conditions in many regions across the country. The inspiring philanthropic response to Pulse offers a model both for how to respond to a crisis, and for how funders can help other communities prevent, address, and prepare for the violence and challenges that LGBTQ communities continue to face every day. As public attention moves on from the epicenter of the site of these tragedies and disasters, philanthropy can play a unique and crucial role in sustaining and building systems for healing, transformation, and empowerment. NOTE: This tracking report focuses only on funding by institutional funders, not individual donors. Much of the giving in response to the Pulse shooting came from individuals, but flowed through institutional vehicles, particularly the Better Together Fund and the OneOrlando Fund, and as a result are tracked in this report. Some foundations and corporations also gave through vehicles such as Better Together, Contigo Fund, and OneOrlando. These grants are also captured in this report, but since these funds were ultimately re-granted, the grant amounts are deducted from totals so as to avoid double-counting, as is done with all re-granting throughout the report.8In Focus: The Philanthropic Response to the Pulse Tragedy2016 Tracking Report91 Strengthen Orlando - OneOrlando Fund $29,510,000 Orlando, FL2 Arcus Foundation $17,555,936 New York, NY 3 Ford Foundation $11,815,800 New York, NY4 Gill Foundation $9,827,940 Denver, CO5 Equality Florida Institute $9,445,045 St. Petersburg, FL6 Open Society Foundations $8,818,097 New York, NY7 Gilead Sciences $7,541,165 Foster City, CA8 Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund $6,989,750 San Francisco, CA9 Elton John AIDS Foundation $5,958,445 New York, NY10 M.A.C.

If the anonymous funders appeared in the top twenty list as as a single funder, they would rank as the number two funder of LGBTQ issues. Collectively, they accounted for 13.5 percent of all LGBTQ grantmaking in 2016. This marks the first time anonymous funders surpassed $25 million in LGBTQ grantmaking.TOP 20 FUNDERS OF LGBTQ ISSUES, BY TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT1,21 Astraea Lesbian Foundation  322 for Justice  New York, NY2 Horizons Foundation  305 San Francisco, CA2 Strengthen Orlando -  305 OneOrlando Fund  Orlando, FL4 Pride Foundation  279 Seattle, WA5 Our Fund Foundation  217 Fort Lauderdale, FL6 Tides Foundation  200 San Francisco, CA7 Arcus Foundation  191 New York, NY8 M.A.C.

Giving by the top ten funders accounted for 57 percent of all LGBTQ funding in 2016.The top twenty funders awarded $146.6 million, accounting for 74 percent of the year’s total. Nine of the top twenty were LGBTQ-specific funders, up from eight in 2015. In 2016, the top twenty list was comprised of nine public foundations, eight private foundations, and three corporate funders.Absent the giving from Strengthen Orlando and Equality Florida Institute, the top ten would have collectively awarded $85 million, up $13.8 million from 2015 and accounting for 43 percent of all LGBTQ funding in 2016. Absent giving from Strengthen Orlando and Equality Florida Institute, the top twenty would include Horizons Foundation and New York Women’s Foundation.WORTH NOTING...10TOP GRANT RECIPIENTSIn 2016, the top 20 recipients of LGBTQ funding received a total of $40.2 million, accounting for 20 percent of all LGBTQ dollars granted in 2016. Eighteen of the top 20 grantees are nonprofit organizations focused specifically on LGBTQ issues.3 Seventeen of the 20 grant receipts are headquartered in the United States, with seven in California, five in New York City, and three in Washington, DC. For the first time, three top grantees are based outside the United States—CREA in India, ILGA-Europe in Belgium, and UHAI in Kenya.1 National LGBTQ Task Force $6,243,261 Washington, DC2 Los Angeles LGBT Center $3,270,791 Los Angeles, CA3 National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) $2,602,500 San Francisco, CA4 Transgender Law Center $2,330,625 Oakland, CA5 Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund $2,124,660 New York, NY6 OutRight Action International $2,113,092 New York, NY 7 San Francisco AIDS Foundation $2,060,558 San Francisco, CA8 The East Africa Sexual Health and Rights Initiative (UHAI) $1,940,827 Nairobi, Kenya9 Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network $1,932,800 Oakland, CA10 SAGE $1,868,263 New York, NY 11 Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) $1,682,300 Boston, MA12 Horizons Foundation $1,539,712 San Francisco, CA13 ILGA - Europe   $1,534,859 Brussels, Belgium 14 Equality Federation Institute   $1,389,400 Portland, OR15 Freedom for All Americans $1,361,000 Washington, DC16 Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice $1,352,100 New York, NY17 New York LGBT Center $1,256,733 New York, NY18 Creating Resources for Empowerment and Action (CREA) $1,216,132 New Delhi, India19 Movement Advancement Project (MAP) $1,215,000 Denver, CO20 Center for the Study  of Social Policy $1,200,000 Washington, DCTOP 20 GRANTEES OF FOUNDATION FUNDING FOR LGBTQ ISSUES  (EXCLUDES GRANT DOLLARS INTENDED FOR RE-GRANTING)43 The two grantees not specifically focused on LGBTQ issues were the Center for the Study of Social Policy and CREA. The Center for the Study of Social Policy, a research institute that promotes ideas and public policies aimed at improving the wellbeing of marginalized children and families, was funded for work that supports LGBTQ youth in the child welfare system. CREA, a feminist human rights organization based in New Delhi, India, was funded for cross-movement building work.4 In 2016, multiple anonymous grantees received a total of $37,160,594. This includes the individuals who received direct financial support in the aftermath of the Pulse Nightclub Massacre in Orlando. If the multiple anonymous grantees appeared in the top twenty list as a single grantee, they would rank as the number one grant recipient of LGBTQ funding.Overview2016 Tracking Report11In 2016, nearly all funder categories increased their support of LGBTQ issues. In particular, funding from public foundations (both LGBTQ-focused and non-LGBTQ-focused) and corporations all saw sharp increases ranging from 40 percent to more than 100 percent. Large portions of these sharp increases were the result of giving related to the Orlando tragedy. The increase in giving by non-LGBTQ public funders was driven largely by the OneOrlando Fund, which was housed at Strengthen Orlando, a nonprofit that raises funds and support projects related to the City of Orlando. The increase from LGBTQ public funders is driven largely by Equality Florida, the state’s LGBTQ advocacy organization, which helped raise more than $9 million that was ultimately channelled through the OneOrlando Fund. Similarly, the rise in corporate giving is a reflection of the large gifts made by several corporations to recovery efforts such as the OneOrlando Fund or the Central Florida Foundation’s Better Together Fund. When giving from and through the OneOrlando Fund is excluded, giving by corporations and non-LGBTQ public funders still experienced growth, but at much more modest levels. Giving by non-LGBTQ public funders other than OneOrlando Fund decreased slightly.Giving by private foundations—both LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ focused—rose significantly, largely unrelated to the philanthropic response to Pulse. Community foundations were the only funder type that experienced an overall decrease in 2016, dropping by about $1.2 million or 14 percent.Due to the large amount of giving for Pulse through public funding vehicles, public foundation funding nearly equalled private foundation funding for LGBTQ issues for the first time in years. When giving related to the OneOrlando Fund is excluded, private foundations again accounted for the largest portion of dollars—about $88.4 million or 45 percent of the total.As in prior years, a large share of funding was driven by private and community foundations founded and driven by LGBTQ donors and leaders. Excluding giving related to OneOrlando, about $65 million, or approximately one-third of the year’s LGBTQ grantmaking, was provided by these types of LGBTQ foundations.SOURCES OF LGBTQ FUNDING14%24%20%11%11%18%12%14%24%11%14%22%14%23%9%13%14%22%Anonymous FundersCorporate FundersNon-LGBTQ Private FoundationsLGBTQ Private FoundationsLGBTQ Public FoundationsCommunity Foundations11%20%18%$46,582,150$25,905,95811%3%$41,817,405$46,582,150$20,449,31011%24%22%14%12%$27,013,70614%$24,146,411$6,853,988$41,817,405$27,013,706$33,591,456$6,863,9884%2016 (includingOneOrlando Fund)2016 (excludingOneOrlando Fund)2015 2016 (includingOneOrlando Fund)20152016 (excludingOneOrlando Fund)$38,633,538$40,326,317$16,546,8199%23%22%14%$21,920,97913%$23,678,677$8,356,0795%Non-LGBTQ Public Foundations$56,920,04424%14%$27,410,044Total$238,694,706$194,273,01314%$25,284,931$174,343,489Sources of LGBTQ Grant Dollars by Funder Type55 In contrast to other sections of this report, this chart includes dollars awarded for re-granting, so as to capture the full amount of funding flowing from (or through) each type of funder. 12GEOGRAPHIC FOCUSNOTE: “International” funding denotes support that is global in focus for activities that addressed LGBTQ issues at the international level, such as advocacy for greater inclusion of LGBTI communities in international law and in the policies of major international bodies, such as the United Nations. Funding “Outside the U.S.” represents support for services and advocacy in countries around the world, generally focused on a specific locality, country, or region of multiple countries.

All other categories of geographic focus saw notable increases. Funding for work at the local level increased dramatically, from $43.6 million to $77.0 million—a 77-percent increase. Much of this rise was due to OneOrlando Fund giving, which was focused on direct relief to victims and families in Orlando in the wake of the Pulse tragedy. When that giving is not included, locally focused funding rose by a more modest $3.9 million, or nine percent. Funding for state-level work rose by eight percent and for regional work rose by 20 percent.Overview2016 Tracking Report13TYPE OF SUPPORTFunding for program or project specific support was the most common type of support in 2016, accounting for 43 percent of all funding.In 2016, direct victim support totaled $29.5 million, or 15 percent of funding. This category of funding was added to the 2016 report taxonomy to account for the unique nature of the funds distributed to the survivors and families of victims of the Orlando tragedy.Funding for capacity building increased from 2 percent of funding in 2015 to 5 percent in 2016.The “other” category captured capital support, corporate matching gifts, emergency funding, endowment support, matching grants, prizes or awards, seed funding, and sponsorships.Consistent with the 2015 report, a greater number of grants were awarded as general operating support. In 2016, 2,250 grants (33 percent) were awarded as general operating support compared to 2,083 grants (43 percent) awarded as program support.Distribution of LGBTQ Grant Dollars by Type of Support (With Strengthen Orlando included)2016 201533%15%43%38%55%20152016Program/Project SupportDirect Victim SupportCapacity-Building SupportScholarships and FellowshipsGeneral Operating Support-2%2%$3,259,624$3,707,243-55%$89,152,51838%$61,743,190$4,018,412$9,628,993$29,510,00015%5%2%$88,073,56943%$67,003,51833%OtherTotal2%$2,840,410$160,702,984$4,078,2792%$202,312,772POPULATION FOCUSThe vast majority of LGBTQ grants in 2016, over $169 million or 83% of funding, targeted the LGBTQ community broadly.

Excluding the grants for individuals provided through the OneOrlando Fund, funding for local, statewide, and regional LGBTQ work in the United States still reached $73.4 million.With the OneOrlando Fund giving, the South is by far the most funded region at $47.4 million. Without the OneOrlando Fund giving, the South was the third most funded region, posting a modest 4 percent increase to $17.9 million.Excluding the OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, the Pacific region received the largest share of grant dollars at $21.3 million, benefiting from a 15 percent increase. The Northeast region, which had long received the largest share of grant dollars, saw a modest 1 percent decrease in funding and dropped to $18.6 million. The Midwest experienced a 6 percent decrease to $8.5 million, and the Mountain region experienced a 12 percent decrease to $3.3 million.In 2016, funding for Puerto Rico increased by 77 percent to $195,000.With OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, Florida is the most funded state ever—receiving $34.3 million. Without the OneOrlando Fund giving, Florida drops down to the third most funded state at $4.8 million, exceeded only by California and New York. Funding in California increased to $16.9 million from $15.3 million in 2015. This $1.6-million increase means that California experienced the largest growth in funding of any state that year. Funding in New York decreased to $10.9 million from $12 million in 2015. The state witnessed the biggest decrease in 2016, a $1.2 million decrease. Nevertheless, excluding OneOrlando Fund giving, these two were the only states to receive more than $5 million in funding for local, statewide, or regional LGBTQ work.In 2016, 28 states and the District of Columbia experienced a decrease in funding for local, statewide, and regional work. Only 13 states and the District of Columbia each received more than $1 million in LGBTQ funding—with Colorado and Ohio dropping below $1 million since 2015. No new states joined the “million dollar club.”There were three states where we could not identify any LGBTQ funding in 2016: Delaware, Kansas, and Wyoming.Region 2016 2015 Percent ChangeMidwest $8,483,928 $9,022,987        6%Mountain $3,321,748 $3,739,348      12%Northeast $18,630,833 $18,806,607        1%Pacific $21,341,571 $18,517,475      15%South (Including OneOrlando Fund) $47,392,284 $17,165,964    176%South (Not Including OneOrlando Fund) $17,882,284 $17,165,964        4%U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico) $195,000 $110,000      77%Multi-Region/Unspecified $3,548,000 $69,500  4971%Total (Including OneOrlando Fund) $102,914,863 $67,431,880     53%Total (Not Including OneOrlando Fund) $73,404,863 $67,431,880     9%Local, State, and Regional LGBTQ Funding, By RegionDomestic Funding of LGBTQ Issues2016 Tracking Report19$3,000,000 - $9,999,999$10,000,000 - $19,999,999$1,000,000 - $2,999,999$500,000 - $999,999$100,000 - $499,999$15,000 - $99,999$1 - $14,999$0$20,000,000+DCPuerto RicoHawaiiAlaskaFlorida (IncludingOneOrlando Fund)Florida (Not IncludingOneOrlando Fund)Midwest $8,483,928Illinois $3,490,607Indiana $289,855Iowa $7,500Kansas 0Michigan $1,194,705Minnesota $1,383,328Missouri $159,513Nebraska $4,500North Dakota $5,000Ohio $623,695South Dakota $6,000Wisconsin $412,975Midwest Region (General) $906,250Mountain $3,321,748Arizona $992,318Colorado $852,123Idaho $59,500Montana $200,436Nevada $231,521New Mexico $675,250Utah $300,600Wyoming 0Mountain Region (General) $10,000Pacific $21,341,571Alaska $50,200California $16,930,992Hawaii $39,643Oregon $1,553,936Washington $1,774,468Pacific Region (General) $992,331U.S. Territories $195,000Puerto Rico $195,000Multi-Regional / Unspecified $3,549,500Total (Including OneOrlando Fund)$102,899,463Total (Not Including OneOrlando Fund)$73,404,863 Northeast $18,630,833Connecticut $206,270Delaware 0District of Columbia $1,755,661Maine $11,500Maryland $556,932Massachusetts $1,583,724New Hampshire $1,300New Jersey $385,139New York $10,929,572Pennsylvania $1,309,185Rhode Island $267,000Vermont $166,250Northeast Region (General) $1,458,300South (Including OneOrlando Fund)$47,392,284South (Not Including OneOrlando Fund)$17,882,284Alabama $357,550Arkansas $118,250Florida (Including OneOrlando Fund)$34,211,819Florida (Not Including OneOrlando Fund)$4,701,819Georgia $2,216,240Kentucky $194,250Louisiana $1,127,405Mississippi $857,000North Carolina $2,016,112Oklahoma $208,750South Carolina $167,500Tennessee $332,600Texas $2,161,906Virginia $414,226West Virginia $43,312South Region (General) $2,965,364Local, State, and Regional Funding of LGBTQ Issues, by State (Density Map)20Our metric of GDQ, or “Grant Dollars per Queer,” analyzes the total local and statewide LGBTQ grant dollars awarded per state or region divided by the estimated number of adults in said state or region who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. The goal of the GDQ is to assess the level of funding for each state relative to its population. In 2016, the overall GDQ increased to $10.42 if you include OneOrlando Fund grantmaking or $7.43 if you exclude OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, up from $6.78 in 2015.While the average GDQ increased, the median GDQ decreased. In 2016, the median GDQ for the 50 states and the District of Columbia was $2.92, down from $3.28 in 2015. It is the lowest median GDQ since 2012, when the median was $2.06.In 2016, 21 states saw their GDQ increase, while the other 29 states and the District of Columbia witnessed a decrease in GDQ.When including OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, Florida experienced the largest GDQ increase, with a $43.39 increase bringing it to a record high GDQ of $49.47. If you exclude OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, Florida had a much more modest $0.72 increase in GDQ to $6.80. Excluding OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, North Carolina had the biggest increase in GDQ, with a $3.45 increase bringing it to a GDQ of $7.34.If you exclude OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, the District of Columbia led the pack once again. Despite experiencing a $3.46 decrease in GDQ, the District of Columbia still had a GDQ of $36.44. New York followed with a GDQ of $15.60, despite a $1.59 decrease in its GDQ. If you exclude OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, New York has the highest GDQ of any state. If you exclude OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, it is also the only state with a GDQ over $15—just as it was in 2015.Excluding OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, 4 states had GDQs over $10—down from the high of 7 states in 2013. Beyond New York, the states were California ($11.46), Mississippi ($11.81), and New Mexico ($10.11).Including OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, the South achieved the highest GDQ of any region at $14.96. Excluding OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, the Pacific had the highest GDQ at $10.92.FUNDING PER LGBT ADULTLGBTQ Funding per LGBT Adult, by State$15.01 – $20.00$10.01 – $15.00$20.01 – $50.00$5.01 – $10.00$2.51 – $5.00$1.01 – $2.50$0.51 – $1.00$0.01 – $0.50$0Florida (IncludingOneOrlando Fund)Florida (Not IncludingOneOrlando Fund)DCDomestic Funding of LGBTQ Issues2016 Tracking Report21Region 2016 2015 Percent ChangeMidwest  $4.38  $4.66       6%Mountain  $4.64  $5.13    10%Northeast  $8.86  $8.94      1%Pacific  $10.92  $9.30    17%South (Including OneOrlando Fund)  $14.96  $5.42  176%South (Not Including OneOrlando Fund)  $5.64  $5.42      4%National Average (Including OneOrlando Fund) $10.42 $6.78    54%National Average (Not Including OneOrlando Fund) $7.43 $6.78    10%LGBTQ Funding, by RegionMidwest  $4.38Illinois  $9.06Indiana  $1.40Iowa  $0.10Kansas $0Michigan  $4.06Minnesota  $8.17Missouri  $1.00Nebraska  $0.09North Dakota  $0.32Ohio  $1.82South Dakota  $0.46Wisconsin  $2.70Mountain  $4.64Arizona  $4.68Colorado  $4.63Idaho  $1.71Montana  $8.20Nevada  $2.13New Mexico  $10.11Utah  $4.28Wyoming $0Pacific  $10.92Alaska  $3.02California  $11.46Hawaii  $0.93Oregon  $9.71Washington  $6.82Northeast  $8.86Connecticut  $2.09Delaware $0District of Columbia  $36.44Maine  $0.24Maryland  $3.06Massachusetts  $5.95New Hampshire  $0.03New Jersey  $1.54New York  $15.60Pennsylvania  $3.60Rhode Island  $7.87Vermont  $6.20South (Including OneOrlando Fund) $14.96South (Not Including OneOrlando Fund) $5.64Alabama  $3.16Arkansas  $1.73Florida (Including OneOrlando Fund)  $49.47Florida (Not Including OneOrlando Fund)  $6.80Georgia  $7.10Kentucky  $1.72Louisiana  $8.54Mississippi  $11.81North Carolina  $7.34Oklahoma  $2.01South Carolina  $1.45Tennessee  $2.08Texas  $2.92Virginia  $1.86West Virginia  $0.87LGBTQ Funding per LGBT Adult, by State 22ISSUES ADDRESSED IN DOMESTIC FUNDINGIssue 2016 % 2015 %Civil Rights $55,254,503 35%  $55,885,884 43%Civil Rights (General) $32,709,734 21% $31,625,177 24%Criminalization and Criminal Justice Reform $3,686,398 2%  $5,107,729 4%Gender Identity Rights $6,310,272 4%  $3,595,965 3%Immigration and Refugee Issues $2,844,901 2%  $1,874,879 1%Marriage and Civil Unions $4,100 <1%  $4,029,050 3%Military Inclusion $821,053 1%  $845,523 1%Nondiscrimination Protections $7,422,833 5%  $4,104,330 3%Religious Exemptions $460,200 <1%  $2,894,300 2%Sexual and Reproductive Rights/Justice $992,012 1%  $1,808,930 1%Violence, Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia $31,564,421 20% $1,692,549 1%Anti-Violence $30,610,939 19%  $799,829 1%Gun Control $26,500 <1%  $140,000 <1%Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia $926,982 1%  $752,720 1%Health and Wellbeing $25,612,314 16% $28,317,586 22%Cancer $602,497 <1%  $413,195 <1%Cultural Competence and Data Collection $1,245,916 1%  $1,604,178 1%General Health Services and Health Promotion $5,908,916 4%  $6,340,213 5%HIV/AIDS $15,912,711 10%  $15,764,517 12%Insurance Coverage $95,000 <1%  $1,840,472 1%Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention $1,512,605 1%  $1,491,928 1%Primary Care $130,478 <1%  $449,330 <1%Sexual and Reproductive Health $204,191 <1%  $413,752 <1%Community, Families, and Visibility $24,996,864 16% $23,565,219 18%Community Building and Empowerment $12,080,027 8%  $9,695,970 8%Religion $1,882,940 1%  $3,396,694 3%Strengthening Families $2,502,577 2% $1,947,477 2%Visibility $8,481,320 5%  $8,525,077 7%The Pulse Nightclub Massacre in Orlando and subsequent philanthropic giving resulted in a massive increase in grantmaking addressing violence, homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia.

If you exclude funding awarded by the OneOrlando Fund, funding to address violence, homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia would only total $2,054,421—making it the least funded issue area.While civil rights remained the most funded issue area, it saw a modest $370,000 decrease. Funding for health and wellbeing became the third most funded issue area, experiencing a more significant $2.7 million decrease.Detailed Breakdown of Issues Addressed in Domestic FundingDomestic Funding of LGBTQ Issues2016 Tracking Report23Education and Safe Schools $6,105,406 4% $7,644,482 6%Education $2,879,025 2% $2,855,157 2%Safe Schools $3,226,381 2%  $4,789,325 4%Economic Issues $6,028,559 4% $5,635,532 4%Food Security $531,800 <1%  $146,052 <1%Housing and Homelessness $4,105,736 3%  $3,723,530 3%Labor and Employment $1,391,023 1%  $1,765,950 1%Other Issues $7,237,623 5% $6,379,385 5%Multi-Issue $2,938,478 2%  $3,420,867 3%Philanthropy $4,299,145 3%  $2,957,018 2%Unspecified $0 0% $1,500 <1%Total $156,799,690 $129,120,635Detailed Breakdown of Issues Addressed in Domestic Funding (cont.)DOMESTIC POPULATION FOCUSAs in previous years, the vast majority of domestic grant dollars were awarded to organizations and programs that serve LGBTQ people generally. Only 18 percent of grant dollars singled out a specific segment of the LGBTQ population. Funding for trans communities in the United States reached a record high of $16.9 million—an increase of nearly 22 percent.Domestic funding for bisexuals dropped to $300. This is largely due to grantmaking by the American Institute of Bisexuality, the largest funder of bisexual issues, not being available for this year’s report. The dramatic drop reveals how few funders explicitly support bisexual issues.2016 2015 20152016Lesbians/Queer WomenBisexual PeopleTransgender PeopleIntersex PeopleGay Men/Queer Men/MSM$244,500$16,976,892$300<1%11%<1%$3,002,1532%$5,984,0824%$307,000$13,246,083$483,415<1%10%<1%$2,512,1112%$4,348,1823%= $250,000Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars by Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Sex Characteristics24Domestic Funding of LGBTQ IssuesIn 2016 there was a major increase in funding for communities for color. Specifically, 2016 saw a dramatic increase in funding for Latinx communities, driven by the philanthropic response to the Pulse shooting. If you include funding from the OneOrlando Fund, funding for communities of color reached a record high of $49.5 million.If you exclude funding from the OneOrlando Fund, funding for communities of color totaled $20 million, up from $18.6 million in 2015. All communities saw modest increases.Excluding funding from the OneOrlando Fund, the top ten funders of communities of color were: Gilead Sciences, Arcus Foundation, Elton John AIDS Foundation, Borealis Philanthropy, ViiV Healthcare, Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Anonymous Donors, the New York Women’s Foundation, H. van Ameringen Foundation, and the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr, Fund. Together they awarded $11.5 million, or 57 percent of all funding for LGBTQ communities of color excluding OneOrlando Fund grantmaking.Excluding funding from the OneOrlando Fund, HIV/AIDS was the most funded issue. Twenty-five percent of all funding for LGBTQ communities of color focused on HIV/AIDS.2016 2015 20152016People of Color (General)Asian American/Pacific IslanderLatinx (Including OneOrlando Fund Grantmaking)Middle EasternAfrican American/Black$11,000$31,973,603$1,153,5821%20%<1%Native American$311,750<1%$10,656,7807%$5,376,9263%$5,000$2,418,783$1,092,2291%2%Latinx (Excluding OneOrlando Fund Grantmaking)$2,463,6032%$2,418,7832%<1%$87,500<1%$10,039,2968%$4,947,6944%= $250,000Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars Among People of Color2016 Tracking Report25Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars Among Other PopulationsWhen including the OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, survivors of violence become the most funded other population at $30.9 million, up from $600,000 in 2015. If you exclude the OneOrlando Fund grantmaking, funding for survivors of violence still more than doubled to $1.3 million.Funding for children and youth, which is historically the most funded subpopulation, continued to decline in 2016 to $20.1 million. That is down from $21.6 million in 2015 and is the lowest level of funding for children and youth since 2011.While most populations experienced decreases in funding, homeless and marginally housed people experienced a $600,000 or 19 percent increase, immigrants and refugees experienced a $1.4 million increase, people living with HIV/AIDS experienced a $1.5 million or 8 percent increase, and people with disabilities experienced a $38,500 or 83 percent increase. (Note that funding for people living with HIV/AIDS exceeds the amount of funding for HIV/AIDS as an issue area. This is because grants focused on direct HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention are coded as the issue of HIV/AIDS, while grants related to food security, housing, or HIV decriminalization are coded specifically for those respective issues.) 2016 2015 20152016Children and YouthHomeless and Marginally Housed PeopleImmigrants and RefugeesIncarcerated/Formerly Incarcerated PeopleEconomically Disadvantaged People$1,857,686$3,505,247$4,032,8733%2%1%Military Service Members and Veterans$848,5531%Older Adults$2,839,5322%People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)$21,357,67914%$20,108,72713%$1,914,2961%People with DisabilitiesSurvivors of Violence (Excluding OneOrlando Fund Grantmaking)Sex Workers$1,362,9511%$85,000<1%$953,5801%Survivors of Violence (Including OneOrlando Fund Grantmaking)$30,872,95120%$2,430,500$2,043,758$3,394,3443%2%2%$863,3731%$3,525,6303%$19,822,05215%$21,615,73017%$1,980,1352%$632,260<1%$632,260<1%$46,500<1%$1,575,1201%= $250,00026In 2016, funding for people of faith increased by nearly 40 percent to $5.4 million, up from $3.9 million in 2015.

NON-LGBTQ ORGANIZATIONSOf the $156.8 million in domestic funding for LGBTQ communities, $124.8 million was awarded to organizations and $32 million supported individuals. (The individuals sum is particularly large in 2016 on account of the direct financial support for the individuals affected by the Pulse Nightclub Massacre.) LGBTQ organizations, those whose mission explicitly focus on LGBTQ issues, were awarded $81.7 million or 65 percent of funding for domestic organizations. Non-LGBTQ organizations that received funding for an LGBTQ-specific program, campaign, or outreach effort were awarded $42.8 million or 34 percent of funding for domestic organizations. Examples of non-LGBTQ organizations receiving significant funding for LGBTQ work in 2016 include the Advertising Council, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for the Study of Social Policy, and the New York Public Library—all of which received more than $1 million in funding.Funding for LGBTQ organizations decreased by $30,000, while funding for non-LGBTQ organizations decreased by more than $2.2 million. As such, the distribution of funding between LGBTQ organizations and non-LGBTQ organizations shifted slightly. In 2015, 64 percent of the funding benefited LGBTQ organizations and 36 support non-LGBTQ organizations. However, this remains only the second year since we started tracking funding by organization type that the percentage of funding for LGBTQ organizations dipped below 70 percent.NOTE: All figures in this section do not include the $32 million awarded to individuals.

National advocacy organizations received the largest share of funding in this category, totaling awards over $16 million in 2016, an increase of nearly $2 million from the $14.4 million national advocacy organizations received in 2015. In contrast to this increase, funding for state-based advocacy organizations decreased 32 percent in 2016, capturing $7.2 million in funding for domestic LGBTQ organizations, down from nearly $11 million in 2015. Funding for legal service organizations saw a notable increase in this report, accounting for 12 percent of funding, or over $10 million in 2016.In keeping with established trends, service providers took the second highest share of funding for domestic LGBTQ organizations, accounting for $25.6 million, or 31 percent of the total. Funding for community centers remained a significant portion of funding for LGBTQ service providers, and even saw an increase in 2016, receiving over $8.4 million. Funding for HIV/AIDS related service providers, the next most funded type of LGBTQ service provider, also saw a slight increase in funding. LGBTQ infrastructure organizations received 11 percent of funding for domestic LGBTQ organizations, consistent with previously reported funding in this category though the category did see a slight increase in raw dollars. This increase was attributed in part to an increase of nearly $2 million for LGBTQ public foundations. Funding remained consistent for the remaining categories of LGBTQ domestic organizations, with only minor fluctuations. Grassroots community groups—including faith-based groups, GSA networks, and pride organizations—captured 8 percent of funding for domestic LGBTQ organizations, followed by arts and culture organizations, which accounted for $3.3 million, a slight decrease from the $3.9 million reported in 2015.

Contrary to the overall decline in the category, domestic funding for some types of non-LGBTQ organizations did see an increase in 2016. Non-LGBTQ service providers, again the second most funded type in this category, accounted for 25 percent of domestic funding for non-LGBTQ organizations, or $10.6 million, up modestly from the $9.5 million reported in 2015. This increase is attributed in part to an increase in funding for non-LGBTQ HIV/AIDS service providers, accounting for 12 percent of funding in the category.  The next highest category, infrastructure organizations, again the third most funded type in this category, accounted for 22 percent of domestic funding for non-LGBTQ organizations, or $9.4 million. This was a modest increase from the $8.2 million reported in 2015 and was driven by increased funding to research institutes and technical assistance providers and networks. Non-LGBTQ community groups as well as non-LGBTQ arts and culture organizations saw modest increases in funding in 2016.Domestic Grant Dollars for  Non-LGBTQ Organizations,  by Recipient Organization TypeAdvocacy Organizations30%Government/Intergovernmental Agencies<1%University/Schools7%30%9%7%22%25%7%Arts and Culture Organizations9%Service Providers25%Grassroots Community Groups7%Infrastructure Organizations22%Domestic Funding by Type of Organization2016 Tracking Report31Organization Type / Sub-Type 2016 % 2015 % Advocacy Organizations $12,892,866 30% $16,657,191 37%Litigation & Legal Services Organizations $2,358,307 6% $5,482,648 12%Local Advocacy Organizations  $1,684,532 4% $2,643,748 6%Regional Advocacy Organizations $520,081 1% $295,000 1%State Advocacy Organizations $1,222,939 3% $708,381 2%National Advocacy Organizations $7,101,007 17%  $7,527,414 17%Arts and Culture Organizations $3,698,477 9%  $3,037,120 7%Government Agencies (Including Public School Systems) $62,850 <1%  $253,157 1%Grassroots Community Groups $2,987,081 7%  $2,179,318 5%Athletic Organizations $1,000 <1% $0 N/ABusiness/Professional Network $916,700 2% $773,300 2%Community Organization $1,329,686 3% $90,000Faith-based Group $738,695 2% $1,316,018 3%Infrastructure Organizations $9,404,028 22% $8,265,585 18%Philanthropic Infrastructure $966,991 2% $156,500 <1%Public Foundations and Intermediaries $3,869,872 9% $4,788,434 11%Research Institutes $3,290,200 8% $2,555,000 6%Technical Assistance Provider and Networks $1,276,965 3% $765,651 2%Service Providers $10,680,212 25% $9,510,443 21%Aging Service Providers $20,100 <1% $68,575 <1%Community Centers $144,537 <1% $206,966 <1%Health Centers $1,815,087 4% $2,128,399 5%HIV/AIDS Service Providers $5,166,619 12% $3,937,189 9%Other Service Providers $2,221,276 5% $1,883,352 4%Support Groups $35,000 <1% $5,000 <1%Youth Service Providers $1,277,593 3% $1,280,961 3%Universities and Post-Secondary Schools $3,148,968 7% $5,274,647 12%Campus Groups $6,250 <1% -High Schools $4,800 <1% $20,007 <1%Universities $3,148,968 7% $5,254,640 12%Grand Total $42,874,483 $45,156,303Breakdown of Domestic Grant Dollars for Non-LGBTQ Organizations, By Recipient Organization Type  and Sub-TypeGLOBAL FUNDING FOR LGBTQ ISSUESIn 2016, U.S.-based foundations awarded 949 grants totaling more than $45.5 million to support international LGBTQ issues and LGBTQ communities outside the U.S. This figure does not include an additional 27 grants totaling $5.6 million that were awarded to intermediaries for international re-granting.

All types of foundations were surveyed—private, public, community and corporate—as well as nonprofit organizations with grantmaking programs. Information was obtained predominantly through self-reporting by grantmakers, as well as through a review of 990s and annual reports. This report includes all information received as of December 20, 2017. Our overarching research goal was to ensure that the data we collected focused specifically on LGBTQ issues and organizations. Therefore, the data set does not include grants to organizations or projects that are generally inclusive of LGBTQ people unless they explicitly address an LGBTQ issue or population. For example, a women’s organization that awarded a grant to develop a sex education curriculum for girls, open and welcoming to all girls, including LBTQ girls, would not have been included in the data. If that same organization was funded to provide sex education specifically to LBTQ girls, it would have been included. We have included all re-granting dollars in charts that rank individual grantmakers and in the appendix to accurately show the overall level of LGBTQ funding provided by each grantmaker, regardless of whether those dollars are provided in the form of direct grants or through an intermediary that then re-grants those dollars to other organizations and individuals. As a result, the charts that rank grantmakers and the appendix ”double-count” re-granting when aggregated. However, for all other tabulations and charts, we have not included dollars awarded for the purpose of re-granting, so as to avoid double counting.We are forever grateful to our members and the other philanthropic entities who generously shared data on their grantmaking for LGBTQ communities. We are especially appreciative to our friends at Funders Concerned About AIDS (FCAA)—John Barnes, Sarah Hamilton, Erika Baehr, and Caterina Gironda—for sharing their LGBTQ-specific HIV/AIDS grantmaking data and for consistently being outstanding collaborative partners in our research efforts. A huge “thank you” is also due to Cindy Rizzo, who graciously proofread the 2016 Tracking Report.METHODOLOGY & ACKNOWLEDGMENTSMETHODOLOGYACKNOWLEDGMENTS52Funders for LGBTQ Issues works to increase the scale and impact of philanthropic resources aimed at enhancing the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities, promoting equity and advancing racial, economic and gender justice.

    "abstract": "This report explores the scope and character of foundation funding for LGBTQ issues in the calendar year 2016. The report analyzes 6,032 grants from 348 foundations, making it the most comprehensive assessment of LGBTQ funding available.The year 2016 brought with it a historic milestone: LGBTQ grantmaking surpassed $200 million for the first time ever. At $202.3 million, we exceeded our strategic goal of $200 million in foundation funding for LGBTQ issues by 2017.However, given the story behind this milestone, it is cause for neither celebration nor declaration of victory. The sharp rise in LGBTQ funding in 2016 was driven in large part by approximately $30 million in funding in response to the Pulse Nightclub Massacre in Orlando, the most violent attack on the LGBTQ community in our history. Without OneOrlando grantmaking, LGBTQ funding reached a record high of $172.8 million, short of the strategic goal of $200 million",
