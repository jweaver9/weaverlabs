We conducted a large-scale field experiment based on the correspondence study methodology to examine interactions between property managers and fictitious couples engaged in searches on a major online rental housing platform. We find no evidence of discrimination against gay male couples but we do find evidence of discrimination against heterosexual couples with a transgender woman partner (trans couples). The latter receive 19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positive responses, and 23% fewer invitations to showings than heterosexual couples. We also assess whether the evidence is consistent with taste-based discrimination or statistical discrimination models by comparing response rates when couples signal being professionals with stable jobs (high SES). While we find no significant effect of the signal for high-SES heterosexual or gay male couples, trans couples benefit from this. Their call-back, positive-response, and invitation rates increase by 25%, 36% and 29%, respectively. These results suggest that discrimination against trans couples is consistent with statistical discrimination. Moreover, we find no evidence of heterosexual couples being favored over gay male couples, nor evidence of statistical discrimination for gay male or heterosexual couples.Keywords: LGBTQ+, discrimination, correspondence study, rental housing market, Latin America.JEL classification: C93, J15, R23, R3.ResumenEn este proyecto evaluamos si hay discriminación contra las personas homosexuales y transgénero en el mercado de alquiler inmobiliario en cuatro países latinoamericanos. Realizamos un experimento a gran escala en el que parejas ficticias consultan por alquileres en una plataforma online. No encontramos evidencia de discriminación contra las parejas de hombres homosexuales y sí encontramos discriminación contra las parejas heterosexuales con una mujer transgénero (parejas trans).  Reciben un 19 % menos de respuestas, un 27 % menos de respuestas positivas y un 23 % menos de invitaciones a visitar la propiedad que parejas cisgénero heterosexuales. También evaluamos si la evidencia se ajusta a la discriminación basada en gustos o discriminación estadística comparando tasas de respuesta cuando las parejas señalan ser profesionales con trabajos estables (alto SES). Mientras que no encontramos efecto significativo de la señal para parejas heterosexuales u homosexuales de alto SES, las parejas trans se benefician. Sus tasas de devolución de llamada, respuesta positiva e invitación aumentan en un 25 %, un 36 % y un 29 %, respectivamente. Estos resultados sugieren que la discriminación contra las parejas trans se ajusta a la discriminación estadística.

Latin America is no exception (Urban et al., 2020). For instance,according to the World Values Survey, a large share of the population of Latin Americancountries would not like to have homosexuals as neighbors. Figure 1 shows that thepercentage varies from almost 10% in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil to more than 30%in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Peru. Anecdotal evidence also suggests thattransgender people are discriminated against in Latin American rental housing markets.1Figure 1: Percentage of Individuals Who Would Not Like to Have Homosexual NeighborsNotes: Data from the World Values Surveys between 2011 and 2020. Individuals were asked the followingquestion: \"On this list are various groups of people. Could you identify any that you would not like tohave as neighbors?\". The figure shows the percentage of respondents choosing the option \"homosexuals.\"Assessing the extent of discrimination in the housing market is of particular inter-est not only because discrimination can be inherently unjust, but also because hous-ing and neighborhoods are key determinants of individuals’ opportunities (Chetty et al.,2016; Chetty and Hendren, 2018; Bergman et al., 2019; Chyn, 2018). Despite its rele-vance, causal evidence on discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in the housing marketis restricted to a few countries in Europe and North America-—e.g., Sweden (Ahmedand Hammarstedt, 2008; Ahmed et al., 2008), Germany (Mazziotta et al., 2015), Serbia1For example, newspapers report discrimination against transgender people in therental housing market in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during the COVID-19 pandemic(https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2021/09/03/le-negaron-el-alquiler-porque-su-novia-es-trans-no-se-hace-por-el-tema-de-tu-pareja/).21 IntroductionDespite increasing efforts to provide equal rights and opportunities to members of theLGBTQ+ community—-i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other diversesexual orientations and gender identities—-discrimination based on gender and sexualorientation still persists and plays an important role in the lives of LGBTQ+ people allaround the world.

To thatend, we conducted a correspondence study (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Jowelland Prescott-Clarke, 1970; Riach and Rich, 1991) that allows us to examine interactionsbetween property managers—-mostly real estate agents—-and fictitious couples engagedin rental searches in a major online rental housing platform.In our experiment, fictitious couples send inquiries to property managers expressinginterest in renting an advertised property and requesting a visit. To identify discrim-inatory behavior based on the renter’s perceived gender identity or sexual orientation,we randomly vary the type of couple between heterosexual, gay male, and heterosexualcouple where the female partner is a trans woman. In addition, we explore whether dis-criminatory behavior is consistent with models of statistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973;Phelps 1972) or taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957). To this end, we randomly varythe amount of information observed to property managers on the renter’s socioeconomicstatus (SES), from providing no information to signaling high SES. Under a statisticaldiscrimination framework, property managers would rely on the type of couple to infertheir (unobserved) SES and vary their responses accordingly. If minorities are less likelyto have high SES, then the gaps in response rates should decrease or disappear after ahigh-SES signal is revealed. In this way, our experiment makes it possible not only tomeasure the extent of discrimination but also to study the underlying mechanisms.The experiment was carried out in April 2022 in the metropolitan areas of the twolargest cities of each country and targeted all property managers who had a property listedon the online platform. As a result, we contacted 3,624 property managers through theonline forms available on the platform. We estimate the causal effects of perceived genderidentity and sexual orientation on three outcomes: call-back rates, positive responsesand invitations to visit the property—based on linear probability models that exploit thevariation across property managers.We find no evidence of discrimination against gay male couples and find strong evi-dence of discrimination against trans couples. Specifically, when no additional informationis revealed (which we refer to as neutral SES), the average call-back and positive responserate for heterosexual couples is close to 35% and 30%, respectively. Similarly, neutral gay-male couples receive slightly fewer responses, but this gap is not statistically significant.In contrast, trans couples receive 19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positive responses, and23% fewer invitations relative to heterosexual couples. Importantly, we find no statisti-cally significant effect of disclosing the high-SES signal on any outcome for heterosexualor gay male couples. However, we do find large and positive effects of the high-SES sig-nal for trans couples. Their response rate increases by 25%, the positive-response rate3increases by 36% and the invitation rate increases by 29% with respect to the neutraltrans couple observed rates. This increase eliminates the gap relative to heterosexual orgay male couples with high SES.Our results do not suggest heterosexual couples are being favored over gay male cou-ples, nor evidence of discriminatory constraints consistent with statistical discriminationfor gay male or heterosexual couples. However, we find evidence of discrimination againsttrans couples in the Latin American online rental housing market, which, at least in part,is due to statistical discrimination.This paper contributes to the growing body of evidence on the economic effects ofLGBTQ+ discrimination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providingcausal evidence from a large-scale field experiment on discrimination based on genderidentity or sexual orientation in Latin American countries. While correspondence studieshave been widely used in the last decades to measure gender- and race-based discrimi-nation in the labor and housing markets in the United States, Canada, and Europe (forinstance, Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2008; Bosch et al.,2010; Hanson and Hawley, 2011; Machelett, 2018), only a few studies have used this ap-proach to measure discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Evidence from the Europeanand Canadian housing markets shows that gay male couples receive fewer call-backs andinvitations to further contacts and to showings than heterosexual couples (Ahmed andHammarstedt, 2009; Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2009; Ahuja and Lyons, 2019; Lausterand Easterbrook, 2011). In U.S. housing markets, results are somewhat mixed. WhileFriedman et al. (2013), Levy et al. (2017), and Schwegman (2018) find that gay malecouples experience less favorable treatment relative to heterosexual couples, Murchie andPang (2018) finds the opposite, i.e., that gay male couples receive the most favorable treat-ment. Our paper contributes to this literature by providing the first piece of evidence toassess discrimination against gay couples in Latin American housing markets.Moreover, this paper joins the very few causal studies that measure discriminationagainst transgender people based on audit or correspondence studies. To the best of ourknowledge, no studies of this kind have been conducted in developing countries. The onlyprecedents that we are aware of are Levy et al. (2017), Langowski et al. (2018) and Fritzson(2021), which analyze discrimination against transgender people in the United States’ andSweden’s housing markets. Granberg et al. (2020) studies discrimination against transpeople in the Swedish labor market, and Button et al. (2020) in the US health market. Forthe case of the U.S. housing market, Levy et al. (2017) finds that housing providers offeredtransgender individuals fewer units than cisgender ones. From 33 in-person paired tests,Langowski et al. (2018) finds that transgender and gender non-conforming people receiveddiscriminatory treatment in the Metropolitan Boston rental housing market. Interestingly,based on a correspondence study contacting 800 landlords by email, Fritzson (2021) findsno significant discrimination against transgender individuals in Sweden but suggests thatthis may be due to the weakness of the transgender signal used in the experiment.2 There2The author signals gender identity with a name change by including the individual’s former name in4BANCO DE ESPAÑA 9 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2315increases by 36% and the invitation rate increases by 29% with respect to the neutraltrans couple observed rates.

Thisinformation allows us to contrast different hypotheses about the type of discrimination.To the best of our knowledge, no other correspondence study assessing discrimination inthe housing market based on gender identity or sexual orientation evaluates statisticalversus taste-based discrimination. Murchie and Pang (2018) is the only exception. Theirexperimental design provides an indirect signal of SES: an email written formally andwithout grammatical errors is taken as a signal for high SES, whereas an email withgrammar mistakes and casually worded is used to proxy low SES.Finally, our results contribute to a better understanding of the type of barriers thatLGBTQ+ people face in accessing housing services in the region to help design moreinclusive programs and policies.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of theexperimental design, implementation, and data collection. Section 3 describes the dataand assesses the validity of the design. Section 4 presents and discusses the main results,while Section 5 explores heterogeneities. Section 6 concludes.2 Experimental DesignWe implemented a large-scale correspondence study in the online rental housing marketin Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to test whether there exists discriminationagainst LGBTQ+ people. We also test how discrimination varies with additional infor-mation about the prospective renter.3One of the main advantages of the correspondence study methodology is that it di-rectly measures discrimination in specific markets and overcomes the lack of representativeand unbiased data, which is prevalent in LGBTQ+ populations (Badgett et al., 2021).Correspondence studies also ensure more robust comparability across treatment groupsthan in prior studies-—e.g., audit studies—guaranteeing that any observed differencesare caused solely by the trait variation. Another advantage of the correspondence studyapproach is its low marginal cost, which allows for a larger sample size and scale.4 In ourparentheses between the first and last name.3The experiment was registered on the AEA RCT Registry as trial AEARCTR-0009012, and thehuman subjects protocol for this research design was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)from Universidad del Rosario.

Such a large sample not only provides more precise estimates but alsoallows us to measure discrimination from more angles and, therefore, to test specific dis-crimination theories (Bertrand and Duflo, 2017). In addition, the use of correspondenceand audit studies to detect discrimination has been scarce or inexistent in these countries.Therefore, we consider this minimizes the probability that audited units might suspect ordetect t e goal of our inquiries and thus modify their behavior. We also reduce the riskof detection by analyzing our first inquiry (Balfe et al., 2021).In our experiment, fictitious couples send inquir es in response to online rental adver-tisements using customized scripts. In the scripts, we randomize the sexual orientationof couples or the gender identity of one of the partners while perfectly controlling allinformation about prospective renters observed by each property manager. We randomlyvary the type of couple among the following three options: heterosexual, gay male, orheterosexual couple where the female partner is a transgender woman, which we refer toas a trans couple for simplicity.5 We also vary the information on the couple’s SES, fromnot signaling SES to providing positive information-—i.e., we inform that both partnersare professionals with stable jobs and have rental collateral. This second variation helpsdistinguish the type of discrimination. Discrimination is mainly estimated by comparingthe response rates for different types of couples and SES information disclosure.The sample comes from a comprehensive database of listings and property managersthat we constructed by scraping one of the largest online rental housing platforms basedon the four countries under analysis. The experiment was carried out in April 2022,and the experimental design involved sending inquiries to property managers using thefillable forms available online. Each property manager received a single inquiry froma randomly assigned fictitious couple with a certain SES signal. We contacted 3,624property managers and received 1,195 responses—-i.e., an overall response rate of 33%.In the remainder of this section, we describe the salient aspects of the experiment.2.1 Property ManagersWe collected information on all available listings and property managers from a majoronline rental housing platform in the four countries under analysis. We focused on apart-ments for rent in downtown and suburban areas in the four capital cities and the country’ssecond-largest city. The cities included are Buenos Aires and Rosario in Argentina, Bo-gota and Medellin in Colombia, Quito and Guayaquil in Ecuador, and Lima and Arequipain Peru.6to corrections for biases.5Given the expected sample size, and randomized components (different couples and signals) we de-cided to keep constant the specific gender for the fictitious individual contacting the agency and onlyfocus on comparisons across these dimensions.

We were notable to record the information corresponding to downtown Medellin. However, we collected information6For each listing, we gathered detailed information on its characteristics: the headingof the advertisement and its publication date, the ame of the property manager, thegeographical location of the apartment, the number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, andgarages, the size in square meters, and the rental cost per month. All this informationwas collected the night before the messages were sent.We imposed several restrictions on the collected sample. First, we dropped propertiesintended for professional or commercial use only, larger than 200 square meters, withmore than four rooms, or published before July 1, 2021. Also, we kept only one listingper property manager (the most recent one) to ensure that the same property manageris not contacted more than once by each applicant.Our final sample includes the 3,624 property managers that sati fy the above re-strictions. Table A.3 reports the distribution of property managers in the final sampleacross countries. The sample size is among he largest in correspondence studies assessingdiscrimination against homosexual or transgender people in the housing market.72.2 Message DesignThe inquiries were sent using standard means used by any prospective renter. In our case,we sent customized scripts through a fillable form available for each listing on the onlineplatform. The fillable forms ask interested parties to add their name, email address, anda message with the inquiry. We built a baseline script to send as a message and varied italong two dimensions: the perceived type of couple and the SES signal disclosure. Thebaseline script expressed interest in renting the apartment and asked to arrange a visit.In the high-SES script, we additionally informed that the two partners are professionalswith stable jobs and that they have collateral.The property managers would infer the type of couple from the names of the twopartners. The names appear in the message body and in the closing signature line. Weused the most popular male and female names in each country, which are not likely to beidentified with other groups potentially discriminated against in Latin America. TableA.4 lists these first and last names. Partner 1 is the partner filling out the online formand sending the message. Partner 1 always uses a male name. His name is also observedin two additional fields submitted through the online form: the prospective renter’s nameand email address.on its suburban districts, which include most property managers from metropolitan Medellin publishingon the online platform.7Related papers for European countries are based on samples between 400 and 800 listings (Ahmedand Hammarstedt (2008) and Ahmed et al.

For a more general review of fieldexperiments to identify discrimination in the housing market, see Table 2 in Bertrand and Duflo (2017).72.2.1 Sc ipt TemplateThe message was written i L tin American Spanish (see Table A.5). Below we s ow theEnglish version of the script template.\"Hello, my name is ${FILL_PARTNER_1}, together with my partner${FILL_PARTNER_2} we are looking for a place to rent, and we are veryinterested in this property. ${FILL_SES_SIGNAL}. We would like to pay avisit soon, what day could we go? We look forward to your response, thankyou very much.${FILL_PARTNER_1} and ${FILL_PARTNER_2}\"W fill the text between \"${}\" in the template with specific rando ized components.I FILL_PARTNER_1 and FILL_PARTNER_2 w use male or female nam s to suggestdifferent gender identities or sexual orientations of couples. In FILL_SES_SIGNAL weinclude a sentence with additional information to signal a high SES. Also, we created asecond script version that provides the same information but worded slightly differently.The second panel of T ble A.5 shows the sec nd script in Spanish.82.2.2 Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity VariationA key element of this study is signaling sexual orientation and identity. For heterosexualand gay couples, introducing a couple´s name identified with a specific gender is animplicit yet straightforward way to convey information, which is standard in the literature.In our setting, the landlord can infer the sexual preferences of the potential tenantswithout the need for clarification about these. Specifically to our experimental design,in the baseline script, FILL_PARTNER_1 is a male name and FILL_PARTNER_2 isa female name. Thus the couple signing the baseline script is likely to be perceived asheterosexual by the property manager. To build our second fictitious type of couple,we vary the couple’s sexual orientation by using a male name for both partners, thussuggesting that it is a gay male couple.For trans-couples, conveying information reasonably and naturally represents a chal-lenge for two reasons. First, there is no implicit way to introduce a trans-partner, such asusing names associated with a gender. Second, rental applicants might only sometimesreveal this information explicitly, in particular, for couples where this would be revealedonce an in-person visit takes place. If discrimination is suspected against a group, re-vealing this information before an in-person visit can avoid undesirable interactions. Inline with this, the signal would help detect discrimination that trans couples would ex-perience later in the application process. Unfortunately, testing discrimination againsttrans-people has been scarcely studied in correspondence studies, so there is no consensus8The scripts are responsive to cultural and language differences across countries. For instance, theverb rentar stands for the English to rent in Colombia, while the other countries use the verb alquilar.See Table A.6 with the list of words that differ across countries. The scripts were tested in two pilotscarried out in February and March 2022.8BANCO DE ESPAÑA 13 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 23152.2.1 Script TemplateThe message was written in Latin American Spanish (see Table A.5).

Unfortunately, testing discrimination againsttrans-people has been scarcely studied in correspondence studies, so there is no consensus8The scripts are responsive to cultural and language differences across countries. For instance, theverb rentar stands for the English to rent in Colombia, while the other countries use the verb alquilar.See Table A.6 with the list of words that differ across countries. The scripts were tested in two pilotscarried out in February and March 2022.82.2.1 Script TemplateThe message was written in Latin American Spanish (see Table A.5). Below we show theEnglish version of the script template.\"Hello, my name s ${FILL_PARTNER_1}, together with my partner${FILL_PARTNER_2} we are looking for a place to ren , and we are veryint rested in this pr perty. ${FILL_SES_SIGNAL}. We would like to p y avisit soon, what day ould we go? W look forward to your esponse, thankyou very much.${FILL_PARTNER_1} and ${FILL_PARTNER_2}\"We fill the text between \"${}\" in the template with specific randomized components.In FILL_PARTNER_1 and FILL_PARTNER_2 we use male or female names to suggestdifferent gender identities or sexual orientations of couples. In FILL_SES_SIGNAL weinclude a sentence with additional information to signal a high SES. Also, we created asecond script version that provides the same information but worded slightly differently.The second panel of Table A.5 shows the second script in Spanish.82.2.2 Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity VariationA key element of this study is signaling s xual o ientation and identity. For heterosexualand gay couples, introducing a couple´s name iden ified with a specific gender is animplicit yet str ightforw rd way to convey information, which is tandard in the literature.In our setting, the landlord can infer the sexual preferences of the potential tenantswithou the eed for clarification about these. Specifically to our xperim ntal design,in the baseline script, FILL_PARTNER_1 is a male name and FILL_PARTNER_2 isa female name. Thus the couple signing the baseline script is likely to be perceived asheterosexual by the property manager. To build our second fictitious type of couple,we vary the couple’s sexual orientation by using a male name for both partners, thussuggesting that it is a gay male couple.For trans-couples, conveying information reasonably and naturally represents a chal-lenge for two reasons. First, there is no implicit way to introduce a trans-partner, such asusing names associated with a gender. Second, rental applicants might only sometimesreveal this information explicitly, in particular, for couples where this would be revealedonce an in-person visit takes place. If discrimination is suspected against a group, re-vealing this information before an in-person visit can avoid undesirable interactions. Inline with this, the signal would help detect discrimination that trans couples would ex-perience later in the application process. Unfortunately, testing discrimination againsttrans-people has been scarcely studied in correspondence studies, so there is no consensus8The scripts are responsive to cultural and language differences across countries. For instance, theverb rentar stands for the English to rent in Colombia, while the other countries use the verb alquilar.See Table A.6 with the list of words that differ across countries. The scripts were tested in two pilotscarried out in February and March 2022.8on how to rovide this signal. Among the few papers that analyze discrimination againstthis group, Fritzson (2021), in Sweden signals gender identity with a name change, justby including the indivi ual’s former name in parentheses between the first and last name.The author finds no discrimination against the group and interprets it as possibly due tothe weakness of the signal. A recent study by Button et al. (2020) uses an online platformhere trans-people explicitly mention being a transgender women or man while seekinga health appointment. This is common practice in this market. In our study, we imple-mented a similar approach and used two scripts with slight variations in how we informthat there is trans woman partner.9 Specifically, to build our fictitious trans couple, wevary the gender identity of the second partner. We do so by filling FILL_PARTNER_2with a female name followed with the clarification \"(she is trans),\" so the property man-ager would perceive this couple heterosexual with a trans woman.Notice that in the first version of the script the names appear in the message bodyand in the closing signature line, but in the second version of the script the names appearonly in the closing signature line. For trans couples, we specify that the partner is trans inthe message body for one script, while the name with the trans information appear in theclosing ignatu line in the other script. Although this differen e could imply a w akersignal of the sexual orientation or gender identity in the latter, we show that our resultsare rob st to the script ve sion in the robustness analysis (see Table A.5). Particularlyfor trans couples, this suggests that landlords consider both signals alike. Additionally,once additional information on labor is provided for trans couples, the responses for trans-people vary, suggesting that, to some extent, this signal is credible.2.2.3 Socioeconomic Status VariationThe second key element of the experimental design, is that we also vary the informa-tion provided to signal better prospective tenants. In the baseline script, we leave theFILL_SES_SIGNAL component empty. Since no explicit information on the job marketor potential collateral is provided in the baseline script, the baseline couple would likelybe perceived as heterosexual with an average socioeconomic level, which we refer to asneutral. To signal a high SES, we inform that both renters are professionals with stablejobs and have rental collateral.2.3 RandomizationThe randomization assignment of treatments to property managers was done within coun-try and unconditionally on any characteristic. For each country, we assigned 1/3 of theproperty managers to be contacted by each type of couple-—i.e., heterosexual, gay male,and trans couple. Next, within each type of couple, we randomly assigned the neutral orhigh-SES signal to 2/3 and 1/3 of the property managers, respectively.9From anecdotal conversations with rental businesses and members of the LGBTQ+ community, oursignals seemed a reasonable way used to transmit this information.9on how to provide this signal.

Our inquiries were sent between April 19 and 20, from 10:30 AM to 5:30 PMUTC-3.As specified in the pre-analysis plan, the time window for attaining a valid responsewas limited to seven days. Past this limit, the observations were classified as non-responses. Automatic responses were also classified as non-responses.10 Overall, weobtained 1,195 responses—-i.e., an average response rate of 33%. Once the interactionwith the property managers was completed, we matched the responses to the listing data,which identifies the treatment as well as characteristics of the apartment and propertymanager as described in Subsection 2.1.11We focus on three outcomes of interest: i) the probability of receiving a response orcall-back rate, ii) the probability of receiving a positive response or positive-response rate,and iii) the probability of receiving an invitation to visit the property or invitation rate.Responses are classified as positive if property managers respond that the property is stillavailable. If, in addition, they mention the possibility of visiting the property or ask thecouple to continue the conversation by phone and provide a contact number, the positiveresponse is in turn classified as an invitation.123 Final Sample and Design ValidationOf the 3,624 observations in our sample, 2,410 (67%) correspond to neutral couples—-i.e.,couples not disclosing the high-SES signal—-and 1,214 (33%) to high-SES couples. TableA.2 shows the distribution across couples and SES signals. Of the total inquiries, 2,000correspond to Argentina, 801 to Colombia, 348 to Ecuador, and 475 to Peru.

Exploration of the table confirms that the randomized components are effectivelybalanced across treatment groups within each country. For instance, about half of theinquiries we sent use script version 1 for each country and treatment group. More impor-tantly, the table also verifies that property managers and rental unit characteristics arebalanced across treatment groups within each country, thus validating the experiment.For instance, all types of couples inquired about apartments of the same average price perroom.

The 2,410 inquiries that correspond to neutral couples aretaken as a base to compute the percentages. Panel (b) shows the gap in the previous rates relative toheterosexual couples.12For neutral heterosexual couples, the average call-back rate is 34.4%, and the positive-response rate is 30.3%. Neutral gay-male couples receive a fewer responses and positiveresponses: 33.6% and 29.2%, respectively, although the gap relative to heterosexual cou-ples is not statistically significant. In contrast, neutral trans couples receive significantlyfewer responses than heterosexual or gay couples. The call-back rate for trans coupleswith no high-SES signal is 27.7%, and the positive-response rate is only 22.2%. Theseresults imply a call-back rate differential of 19% and a positive-response rate differentialof 27% lower for neutral trans couples relative to neutral heterosexual couples. The gapsbetween couples are similar when comparing invitation rates: there is no statistically sig-nificant difference between gay male and heterosexual couples, but trans couples receivesignificantly fewer invitations. The invitation rate for neutral trans couples is 23% lowerrelative to heterosexual couples. These results suggest the presence of large and statisti-cally significant discriminatory behavior against trans couples but not against gay malecouples.4.2 The Role of Additional Information: Signaling High SESNext, we explore whether our results are consistent with taste-based or statistical discrim-ination models. For example, differences in response rates or the response type acrossgroups might be evidence of prejudice against LGBTQ+ people, corresponding to taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957). But differences in responses may also arise fromstatistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973; Phelps, 1972). For instance, high-SES candi-dates might receive favorable treatment if property managers consider them more likelyto timely afford rental costs than candidates with lower SES. Under statistical discrimi-nation, if the share of high-SES candidates is perceived to be lower among couples in theminority group, then—-absent additional information-—property managers would replyless frequently or less positively to inquiries from minority couples. If a high-SES signalis provided, however, property managers should rely on this signal, potentially reducingreply gaps. To test whether the evidence is consistent with taste-based or statistical dis-crimination, we compare call-back rates, positive response rates, and invitation rates forthe same type of couple with different SES signals-—i.e., neutral couples versus high-SEScouples. If statistical discrimination is prevalent, then the disclosure of the high-SESsignal should reduce the gaps observed for neutral couples in Figure 2.Figures 3 and 4 show how response rates change when couples signal a high SES.Heterosexual couples receive more responses, positive responses and invitations after dis-closing a high-SES signal-—the outcomes increase by 3.2, 3.0 and 2.4 percentage points,respectively—-but the changes are not statistically significant. For gay male couples, wefind that the effect of disclosing a high-SES signal is virtually null for the three outcomes.In contrast, for trans couples, we find large and statistically significant differences whenSES information is revealed. When trans couples signal high SES, their call-back rates,positive-response rates and invitation rates increase respectively by 7, 8 and 5 percent-13BANCO DE ESPAÑA 18 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2315For neutral heterosexual couples, the average call-back rate is 34.4%, and the positive-response rate is 30.3%.

Reassuringly, the additional controls do not affect key estimates given therandomized nature of the experiment, but help increase precision. The main results areas follows. First, we find no statistically significant differences in call-back rates or thetype of responses between neutral gay male and neutral heterosexual couples. Neutral gaymale couples receive about one percentage point fewer responses and positive responsesand 1.3 percentage points more invitations than heterosexual couples. However, thesedifferences are small and never statistically significant. On the contrary, neutral transcouples receive much fewer responses, positive responses and invitations than the othercouples. The gaps relative to neutral heterosexual couples are between 6 and 8 percentagepoints, which are highly statistically significant across specifications. When assessing theeffect of a high-SES signal, we never find statistically significant effects for heterosexualor gay male couples. For instance, the call-back rate for heterosexual couples increaseswith the high-SES signal by between 3.2 and 1.3 percentage points depending on thespecification, but this change is never statistically significant. The negative coefficientsassociated with the high-SES signal for gay couples is surprising, although these are gen-erally close to zero and never statistically significant.

Themodel represents a situation where individuals belonging to different groups seek to renta property, and the property manager has to decide whether or not to respond to theirinquiries. There is a minority group A, gay male and trans couples in our experiment,and a majority group B, heterosexual couples.In our experiment, couples reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity, thusthe model assumes that the property manager knows the group to which each candi-date belongs. The property manager might have a distaste for minorities, represented in17the model as a disutility (d > 0). This disutility reflects taste-based discrimination. Inaddition, there is an average cost (k > 0) associated with no high-SES couples. The prob-ability of h ving a high SES might vary across types of couples, giving rise to statisticaldiscrimination.Although simple, this model has some testable implications to shed light on the mech-anisms und rlying our results. When couples do not disclose their socioeconomic status-—the neutral couples in our experiment—-the difference in the call-back rate across typesof couples captures the existence of discrimination. However, we cannot identify whetherit is taste-based or statistical discrimination from this unique variation. But, if the gapsin call-back rates between different couple types vary when information about SES isreve led, that would be consist n with the xistence of statistical discrimination sug-gesting that property managers’ beliefs about the distribution of SES differ across typesof couples. For instance, property managers could expect that gay couples are on aver-age poorer than heterosexual couples, given the existence of labor market discriminationagainst gay men, and therefore would be l ss inclined to reply to their inquiries.14 Onthe contrary, it could be that property managers believe that gay male couples are onaverage richer h n heter sexual couples due to the well-known gender earnings gap infavor of men.In our exp iment, we find no significant differences in esponse rates, positive-respo serates or invitation rates b ween neutral gay couples and neutral heterosexual couples,consistent with absence f discrimin tion against gay men, at least at this stage of thehousing search. We also do not find evidenc of statistical discrimination against gaymale couples since ther are no significant changes in response rates after the high-SESsignal is revealed.Regarding trans couples, we find evidence of discrimination compared to heterosexualand gay male couples in the absence of information on socioeconomic status. As dis-cussed previously, neutral trans couples receive 19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positiveresponses, and 23% fewer invitations than neutral heterosexual couples. Absent any otherinformation, this gap could be due to taste-based or statistical discrimination. In the firstcase, the gap would arise from a distaste of the property manager for trans couples. Inthe second case, however, the gap would be the result of property managers’ beliefs abouttrans couples’ SES. For instance, as trans people are less likely to be employed and havehigher poverty rates than otherwise similar cisgender individuals (Carpenter et al., 2022),absent socioeconomic information, property managers might assume that trans couplesare less likely to be from a high SES. Even more, it may be that property managers fearthat the apartment is used for some illegal activity if the renter is trans.15 Therefore,14See for instance Neumark (2018), which surveys evidence on discrimination in the labor marketagainst gays and lesbians coming from experimental research.15Stereotypes usually link trans people to sex work. In Argentina, for instance, the public debate duringthe 1990s gave rise to the construction of a political-social identity of the transvestite-trans collectiveclosely related to sex work (Guerrero and Miranda, 2018). Usually the lack of access to formal employmenttends to expose trans persons to dangerous working conditions, often forcing them to turn to sex workas a survival strategy (OEA, 2020).

According to a survey on the trans population carried out in 2019 in18signaling high SES might be particularly beneficial for this group.The fact that the differential treatment against trans couples disappears when thehigh-SES signal is provided suggests that part-—if not most—-of the observed discrimi-nation against trans couples is statistical.5 Heterogeneity AnalysisIn this section, we study whether discrimination levels and their patterns vary acrosscountries, with property manager characteristics or the rental unit. This analysis wouldallow us to assess which variables predict higher degrees of discrimination while providinga deeper understanding of the behaviors leading to the observed discrimination patterns.This section presents results on our main outcome: call-back rates. Results are similarfor positive-response rates and invitation rates.5.1 Does Discrimination Vary across Countries?Average call-back rates vary across countries: from 38% in Argentina, 31% in Ecuadorand Peru, and only 22% in Colombia (Table A.3 reports these figures).16Figure 5 shows the average call-back rates in each country for the different types ofcouples. These are unconditional call-back rates, similar to those in column 1 of Table2. Table A.7 in the Appendix reports all estimated coefficients and the correspondingstandard errors and shows in Panel B that the results are robust to the inclusion ofcontrols as in column 4 of Table 2.First, we find the same pattern regarding discrimination against trans couples in allcountries. Trans couples receive fewer responses than heterosexual couples, but the levelsof discrimination differ. For instance, in Ecuador and Pe u, rans couples receive 38%and 33% fewer responses, respectively, than heterosexual couples. In Argentina, the gapis only 14% and the gap is 17% in Colombia, but it i no precisely estimated.Another pattern common to the four countries is that discrimination against transcouples decreases or disappears with the high-SES signal. In other words, the sign of theTrans×HighSES coefficient is positive for all countries, though there are differences interms of magnitude and statistical significance. For instance, the effect is not statisticallysignificant in Argentina or Peru.17On the contrary, for gay couples, we find marked differences across countries. Whilewe find no evidence of discrimination against neutral gay couples in none of the countries,as the Gay coefficients are very close to zero and not statistically significant, we findthe Buenos Aires Province (PBA, 2019), 41.7% of LGBTQ+ people engaged in sex work as their mainsource of income.16The share of each country in our sample is unbalanced, so some results are more reliable than others.Of the 3,624 inquiries in our sample, 2,000 (55%) correspond to Argentina, 801 (22%) to Colombia, 475(13%) to Peru and 348 (less than 10%) to Ecuador. Also, the response rates are quite different acrosscountries.17However, the high-SES signal for trans couples does have a significant effect in Buenos Aires, whichrepresents 95% of the sample for Argentina.19signaling high SES might be particularly beneficial for this group.The fact that the differential treatment against trans couples disappears when thehigh-SES signal is provided suggests that part-—if not most—-of the observed discrimi-nation against trans couples is statistical.5 Heterogeneity AnalysisIn this section, we study whether discrimination levels and their patterns vary acrosscountries, wi h property manager c aracteristics or the rental unit.

Also, the motivation to rent the property, how theyweigh different characteristics of potential tenants and even the emotional attachment tothe property can be very different across different property managers.To characterize property managers, we rely on proxies of their size that could also beassociated with different organizational structures. The dimensions we consider are the20following: i) whether the number of ads of the property manager in the online platformis below or above the sample median, ii) whether the property manager has a single ad inthe online platform, and iii) whether the property manager has the same name as otherproperty managers in different districts. We interpret that property managers with asingle listing on the online platform are more likely to be private owners as opposed toreal state agents or firms.18 When different property managers share a common name weinterpret it is a franchise or a multi-branch firm.Smaller property managers—-i.e., size below the median, private owner or not franchise—-exhibit higher call-back rates but also higher discrimination (see columns 1 to 9 in TableA.8). Figure 6 shows the gaps in call-back rates between neutral trans (gay) couplesand neutral heterosexual couples. The call-back rate differential for trans couples relativeto heterosexual couples is somewhat wider for smaller property managers. For instance,private owners respond 25% less to trans couples than to heterosexual couples, while thegap is only 17% for real estate agencies. Despite these differences, we find evidence of dis-crimination against trans couples for all types of property managers, and the differencesbetween property managers are not statistically significant. We also find for all typesof property managers that the high-SES signal reduces or eliminates discrimination fortrans couples (see Figure 7). The coefficients are always positive and in most cases highlystatistically significant.For gay couples, and regardless of the type of property manager, we again find noevidence of discrimination. Also, we again find a negative effect on call-back rates whengay couples signal a high SES to property managers below the median size or privateowners. Although the coefficients are not statistically significant, this counterintuitiveresult deserves further analysis.5.3 The Higher the Demand, the Greater the DiscriminationWe also look at how discrimination changes with the time elapsed since the propertywas first listed. The fact that a property remains in the platform after a certain periodof time may mean that other properties were preferred or that the demand for thatparticular property is lower than expected. On the other hand, demand could be higher fornewer properties. Given everything else, profit-maximizing behavior would lead propertymanagers to discriminate less the longer the property remains on the platform. That is,when there is fewer demand fo a unit, discrimination might be more costly. But causalitymay go in the opposite direction: when property managers are more demanding-—andperhaps more discriminating—-it may take longer to rent the property. In this case weshould find greater discrimination the longer the property remains on the platform.18We would like to compare the results between real estate companies and private owners, but thisinformation is not available on the online platform. Based on similar listings on another online platformwith extensive coverage in Argentina and Peru, we know that about 17% and 14%, respectively, correspondto private owners.21following: i) whether the number of ads of the property manager in the online platformis below or above the sample median, ii) whether the property manager has a single ad int e online platform, and iii) whether the property manager h s the same name as otherproperty m nagers in different districts.

We defineold listings as those that have been published on the platform for at least 24 days-—thesample median—-while new listings appeared on the platform within the last 23 days.19We find that inquiries about new properties receive more responses than inquiriesabout the old ones-—38% and 31%, respectively. However, discrimination is also higherfor the new properties, at least discrimination against trans couples. The call-back rate fortrans couples inquiring about new properties is significantly lower than for heterosexualcouples. The gap disappears when trans couples signal a high SES (see Figures 6 and 7,and columns 10 to 12 in Table A.8). In other words, the Trans and Trans×HighSEScoefficients have a similar magnitude, almost 8 percentage points, but opposite signs-—negative and positive, respectively; both are highly statistically significant. In contrast,we find no evidence of discrimination against trans couples for inquiries regarding oldproperties. This suggests that property managers discriminate more when it comes tonewer listings, which might be associated with expecting higher demand. If the cheapestproperties are the first to be rented, this behavior would imply restrictions on the accessof trans couples to the cheapest properties.5.4 Heterogeneity by Rental PriceWe next analyze how discrimination varies with the rental price per room. We split thesample into two groups: the high- and low-price groups depending on whether the priceper room is above or below the average price per room in the corresponding district. Wefind large and statistically significant discrimination against trans couples asking aboutlow-price properties but no statistically significant evidence of discrimination when theyinquire about high-price properties (see Figure 6 and columns 13 to 15 in Table A.8). Thisresult is linked to that discussed in the previous point and suggests that trans couplescould suffer restrictions in accessing the best price opportunities.5.5 Does Competition Affect Discrimination?To explore how discrimination varies with the supply of apartments, we split the samplebetween property managers who were exposed to more or less offers within their districts.We take the number of listings published on the platform within district as a proxy forcompetition. We thus define the high- and low-competition groups depending on whetherthey belong to districts above or below the median number of listings.We find no evidence that discrimination against neutral trans couples is affected bybeing in a district with above median listings—the coefficients associated with the Transdummy are of similar magnitude and statistically significant for both groups (see Figure6 and columns 16 to 18 in Table A.8). Moreover, only property managers in the high-competition group reduce discrimination when trans couples signal a high SES (see Figure7).19We find similar results when taking other thresholds, such as one month.24To explore this issue, we split the sample between “old” and “new” listings. We defineold listings as those that have been published on the platform for at least 24 days-—thesample median—-while new listings appeared on the platform within the last 23 days.19We find that inquiries about new properties receive more responses than inquiriesabout the old ones-—38% and 31%, respectively.

To that end, we conducted a large-scale correspondencestudy where fictitious couples send inquiries to property managers expressing interest inrenting a property listed on an online platform.To identify discriminatory behavior based on the renter’s perceived gender identityor sexual orientation, we randomly vary the type of couple between heterosexual, gaymale, and heterosexual couple where the female partner is a trans woman. In addition,we randomly assign a high-SES signal across couples to explore whether the evidence isconsistent with taste-based or statistical discrimination.Overall, we do not find discrimination against gay couples relative to heterosexualcouples. In contrast, we find strong discrimination against trans couples compared togay male and heterosexual couples. Specifically, when information about SES is notrevealed (which we refer to as neutral SES), the call-back rates, positive-response rates andinvitation rates for heterosexual and gay male couples are similar. However, trans couplesreceive 19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positive responses, and 23% fewer invitationsrelative to heterosexual couples. Importantly, we find no statistically significant effectof disclosing the high-SES signal on any outcome for heterosexual or gay male couples.However, we do find large and positive effects of the high-SES signal for trans couples.Their response rate increases by 25%, the positive-response rate increases by 36% andthe invitation rate increases by 29%, closing the gap relative to heterosexual or gay malecouples with high SES.These results suggest the presence of discrimination against trans couples in the LatinAmerican online rental housing market, which-—at least in part-—is due to statisticaldiscrimination. Moreover, we find no evidence of heterosexual couples being favored overgay male couples, nor evidence of discriminatory constraints consistent with statisticaldiscrimination for gay male or heterosexual couples. There is an important considerationto these findings, as with all correspondence studies. We observe a first interaction withproperty managers and not the final rental outcome.We also find that discrimination against trans couples intensifies in certain contexts.We find that property managers discriminate more when it comes to newer listings or tolow-price properties, suggesting that trans couples could suffer restrictions in accessingthe best price opportunities.25BANCO DE ESPAÑA 30 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2315References #Ahmed, Ali M., Lina Andersson and Mats Hammarstedt.

We follow the intuitionof discrimination models applied to labor markets (Neumark, 2018) or housing markets(Ewens et al., 2014). In particular, we are interested in understanding what drives theproperty manager to continue or not with the interaction with a certain candidate uponreceiving an inquiry.If she continues with the interaction, she obtains an expected return v > 0. Thisvalue v captures the rent and additional cost not explicitly modeled. However, she alsohas a reservation value s of not answering the message. This reservation value s followsa distribution F : [0,+∞) → [0, 1] and captures alternative scenarios at the time ofreceiving the inquiry that are not linked with the potential candidate characteristics.The value of s is higher if the property manager has already received many inquiries forthe same property, she is dealing with multiple properties to rent, or the property is “hot”in the market. It is lower if the property owner is in a hurry to find a tenant or if theproperty has been listed for a while.Consequently the property manager observes the expected return to continue withthe potential candidate v, and chooses to continue with the interaction if s ≤ v; i.e., thereservation value is lower than the expected return to continue. Ex ante, a potential tenantanticipates that the property manager replies to the inquiry with probability Pr(s ≤ v) =F (v).With this decision making process in mind, we incorporate two sources of discrimina-tion for candidates belonging to a minority group A. The first is taste-based discrimina-tion. Suppose that the property manager assigns a valuation v to a candidate belongingto a majority group B and a valuation v−d to a candidate belonging to a minority groupA, then d > 0 stands for a dislike cost that generates the taste-based discrimination.The probability of replying is F (v) for candidates belonging to group B and F (v− d) forcandidates belonging to group A. The implication of this taste-based discrimination isthat the probability of replying an inquiry is lower for a candidate in the minority groupA, as F (v − d) < F (v).Second, we introduce statistical discrimination (we focus only on this source of dis-crimination in this paragraph). We assume that there are some tenants with low socioe-conomic status who may generate some unexpected cost when renting a property. Forinstance, this cost may involve financial issues or problems with neighbors requiring anintervention from the owner. We assume there is an ex ante expected cost k > 0 anda proportion q of tenants associated with these cases. Consequently a candidate gener-ates expected profits of (v − k, v) with probability (q, 1 − q) depending on the unknowncharacteristic of the tenant. Then the property manager anticipates an expected returnv− q k. The statistical discrimination is generated when the proportion q differs betweencandidates in groups A and B, where we assume qA > qB. If qA > qB, v−qA k < v−qB k34and, then, the probability of replying to an inquiry is lower for a candidate belonging toa minority group A than for a candidate belonging to a majority group B.Mixing both the taste-based and the statistical discrimination is simple. A candidatefrom group A generates an expected return of v − qA k − d to the property manager,where a candidate from group B generates an expected return v − qB k. The probabilityof answering an inquiry from a candidate in group A is lower than from a candidatein group B because of the taste-based discrimination d and the higher proportion ofcandidates with expected cost k (qA > qB). For simplicity we assume that v > k + d.In this environment we assume that majority-minority condition is revealed. Addition-ally, a signal about the socioeconomic status may be disclosed, implying that a candidatedisclosing a signal will not incur in the cost k regardless of whether she belongs to groupA or B. Instead, if the socioeconomic status is concealed, the cost k may or may notexist (with probability (q, 1− q)). Then, four cases are identified:1. Minority group A with signal: expected return v − d, receiving a reply with proba-bility F (v − d).2. Minority group A with no signal: expected return v − qA k − d, receiving a replywith probability F (v − qA k − d).3. Majority group B with signal: expected return v, receiving a reply with probabilityF (v).4. Majority group B with no signal: expected return v − qB k, receiving a reply withprobability F (v − qB k).Under some assumptions, we can derive some conclusions comparing these scenarios:• Corollary i: the difference in the probability of replying between cases 4 and 2captures the existence of taste-based and/or statistical discrimination.• Corollary ii: the difference in the probability of replying between cases 3 and 1mainly captures the existence of taste-based discrimination.Expanding this analysis to more than two groups is straightforward. For instance,this paper discusses three groups: a majority group of heterosexual couples with twominority groups: gay-male and transgender couples. However, there are some caveats tobe considered in the extension. First, the effects of discrimination may not be the sameamong all minority groups; one group may be subject to statistical discrimination, andthe other may not experience any type of discrimination (at least at the stage considered).Second, the signal may also have different impact or may convey different informationdepending on the group. That is, the high-SES signal may be stronger when disclosed bytrans couples than gay male couples because, for instance, the stronger barriers faced bythe former in the educational system and labor market.35BANCO DE ESPAÑA 39 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2315and, then, the probability of replying to an inquiry is lower for a candidate belonging toa minority group A than for a candidate belonging to a majority group B.Mixing both the taste-based and the statistical discrimination is simple.

Tables C.2 and C.3 show similar exercises for the positive-response andinvitation rates.Changing the geographic coverage of the sample. In the first exercise, we explore whetherour main results hold after changing the geographic coverage of the estimation sample.Therefore, we impose different restrictions on the estimation sample: i) we keep only thecapital city of each country with its suburban areas (column 2), ii) we keep only thecapital city without its suburban areas (column 3), and iii) we keep only districts with atleast one response (column 4). In all cases, our main results hold. The largest differencesappear in column 3—-only capital cities without suburban areas-—where we are left withless than half of the original sample, although the general conclusions do not change. Forexample, the coefficient of the Gay dummy remains negative but becomes much largerin absolute value and statistically significant. This is the only specification for which wefind evidence of discrimination against gay male couples.Changing definition of automatic responses. Determining whether a response was auto-matic required an analysis of both the content and style of the response that was carriedout by a team of research assistants. To rule out that our results depend on such a clas-sification, we complement this classification and use the time elapsed between sendingthe message and receiving a response. When the response arrives in a time less than acertain threshold, it is also classified as automatic and, therefore, as an invalid response.Column 5 of the table shows the results for a 2-minute threshold. Our results are robustto this change, as well as to other alternative thresholds.Changing the time window for attaining valid responses. The pre-analysis plan limits thetime window for a valid response to seven days. In this exercise, we modify this limit.Columns 6 and 7 of the table show the results when the time window is set to two days ortwo weeks, respectively. In both cases our main results are not sensitive to these changes.Changing the script. In columns 8 and 9, we evaluate the robustness of our results tothe script version. The result of discrimination against trans couples holds under bothscripts. This is very important since in script 1 could be perceived as having a strongertrans signal than in script 2.20 For script 1 we also find a positive and significant effect ofthe high-SES signal not only for trans couples but also for heterosexual couples. Instead,20Remember that script 1 begins with \"Hello, my name is $ {FILL_PARTNER_1}, together withmy partner ${FILL_PARTNER_2} (she is trans)\", while script 2 signalled the trans signal only in theclosing signature.36BANCO DE ESPAÑA 40 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2315C Robustness AnalysisIn this appendix, we perform several exercises to assess the robustness of our main results.Table C.1 shows the robustness results regarding the probability of receiving a response.As a basis for comparison the first column replicates the specification in column 4 of Table2–i.e., the model including all controls but the rental unit characteristics to avoid losing128 observations.

Our experiment randomizes treatmentsacross property managers in each country. As a result, our sample is balanced in theobservable characteristics of these property managers as shown in Table 1. Given ran-domization, we should not worry about the possibility that the unobservables are unbal-anced. To have an additional control for these unobservables, we repeated the experimentby sending a second round of messages to the sa e property managers varying t e typeof couple or the SES signal. Although we also varied the script version between rounds,a caveat arises because receiving two similar inquires may seem suspicious to propertymanagers, thus affecting their responses. Despite this, we think there is value in showingthese results as a robustness exercise.21Based on the responses to the two rounds of messages, we estimate equation 1 addingproperty manager fixed effects and report the results in column 10 of Table C.1. Again,our main results still hold, although the statistical significance of the effect of the high-SESsignal for trans couples is reduced.21The second round of messages took place in May 2022, two weeks after the first round. The random-ization was conditional on the treatment received in the first round. For instance, we randomly assignedone of the remaining five treatments to property managers who received a first inquiry from a neutral-SESheterosexual couple. The property managers who received the first inquiry from gay male or transgendercouples, received messages from heterosexual couples in the second round, half with a high-SES signal.This is particularly relevant for the trans-couples, as being exposed to more than one possibly infrequentsignal increases the likelihood of detecting the correspondence (Balfe et al., 2021). Figure C.1 in AppendixA illustrates the randomization procedure and the resulting distribution of inquiries across treatments.37BANCO DE ESPAÑA 41 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2315the high-SES signal from script 2 is weaker: the coefficients associated to the interactionterms are not statistically significant with script 2.Controlling for property managers fixed effects.

For instance, we randomly assignedone of the remaining five treatments to property managers who received a first inquiry from a neutral-SESheterosexual couple. The property managers who received the first inquiry from gay male or transgendercouples, received messages from heterosexual couples in the second round, half with a high-SES signal.This is particularly relevant for the trans-couples, as being exposed to more than one possibly infrequentsignal increases the likelihood of detecting the correspondence (Balfe et al., 2021). Figure C.1 in AppendixA illustrates the randomization procedure and the resulting distribution of inquiries across treatments.37the high-SES signal from script 2 is weaker: the coefficients associated to the interactionterms are not statistically significant with script 2.Controlling for property managers fixed effects. Our experiment randomizes treatmentsacross property managers in each country. As a result, our sample is balanced in theobservable characteristics of these property managers as shown in Table 1. Given ran-domization, we should not worry about the possibility that the unobservables are unbal-anced. To have an additional control for these unobservables, we repeated the experimentby sending a second round of messages to the same property managers varying the typeof couple or the SES signal. Although we also varied the script version between rounds,a caveat arises because receiving two similar inquires may seem suspicious to propertymanagers, thus affecting their responses. Despite this, we think there is value in showingthese results as a robustness exercise.21Based on the responses to the two rounds of messages, we estimate equation 1 addingproperty manager fixed effects and report the results in column 10 of Table C.1. Again,our main results still hold, although the statistical significance of the effect of the high-SESsignal for trans couples is reduced.21The second round of messages took place in May 2022, two weeks after the first round.

    "abstract": "En este proyecto evaluamos si hay discriminación contra las personas homosexuales y transgénero en el mercado de alquiler inmobiliario en cuatro países latinoamericanos. Realizamos un experimento a gran escala en el que parejas ficticias consultan por alquileres en una plataforma online. No encontramos evidencia de discriminación contra las parejas de hombres homosexuales y sí encontramos discriminación contra las parejas heterosexuales con una mujer transgénero (parejas trans). Reciben un 19 % menos de respuestas, un 27 % menos de respuestas positivas y un 23 % menos de invitaciones a visitar la propiedad que parejas cisgénero heterosexuales. También evaluamos si la evidencia se ajusta a la discriminación basada en gustos o discriminación estadística comparando tasas de respuesta cuando las parejas señalan ser profesionales con trabajos estables (alto SES). Mientras que no encontramos efecto significativo de la señal para parejas heterosexuales u homosexuales de alto SES, las parejas trans se benefician. Sus tasas de devolución de llamada, respuesta positiva e invitación aumentan en un 25 %, un 36 % y un 29 %, respectivamente. Estos resultados sugieren que la discriminación contra las parejas trans se ajusta a la discriminación estadística.We assess the extent of discrimination against gay and transgender individuals in the rental housing markets of four Latin American countries. We conducted a large-scale field experiment based on the correspondence study methodology to examine interactions between property managers and fictitious couples engaged in searches on a major online rental housing platform. We find no evidence of discrimination against gay male couples but we do find evidence of discrimination against heterosexual couples with a transgender woman partner (trans couples). The latter receive 19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positive responses, and 23% fewer invitations to showings than heterosexual couples. We also assess whether the evidence is consistent with taste-based discrimination or statistical discrimination models by comparing response rates when couples signal being professionals with stable jobs (high SES). While we find no significant effect of the signal for high-SES heterosexual or gay male couples, trans couples benefit from this. Their call-back, positive-response, and invitation rates increase by 25%, 36% and 29%, respectively. These results suggest that discrimination against trans couples is consistent with statistical discrimination. Moreover, we find no evidence of heterosexual couples being favored over gay male couples, nor evidence of statistical discrimination for gay male or heterosexual couples",
