These technologies have caused numerous harms to queerpeople, including privacy violations, censoring and downrankingqueer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassmentby making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer peo-ple. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness byclassifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, thequeer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, de-centralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employsintersectional and community-led participatory design to build aninclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer inAI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. Weexamine how participatory design and intersectional tenets startedand shaped this community’s programs over the years.

In 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Ac-countability, and Transparency (FAccT ’23), June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA.ACM,NewYork, NY, USA, 14 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3593013.35941341 INTRODUCTIONArtificial intelligence (AI) has seen enormous developments in re-cent years, such as substantial advances in protein modeling, drugdiscovery, weather prediction, and personalized medicine [67, 102,128]. The ubiquity of unregulated AI within socio-technical sys-tems, however, often produces discriminatory outcomes and harmsmarginalized communities globally [8, 10, 66]. For queer people inparticular, machine learning models learn brittle, toxic represen-tations that cause representational and allocational harms, frommisgendering to healthcare discrimination [32, 37, 70, 124]. Identi-fying and mitigating harmful outcomes has led to the developmentof computational and socio-technical methods for achieving fair-ness [13, 29, 86], including automatic evaluation and unfairnessmitigation techniques [16, 41, 86]. While such approaches havethe potential to mitigate harms for queer people in domains likefighting online abuse, health, and employment [124], computa-tional techniques generally encode narrow conceptualizations offairness where queer identities are assumed to be known, observ-able, measurable, discrete, and static [81]. By locating the source ofunfairness in individuals or in specific design decisions [129], com-putational approaches to fairness can reinforce existing power rela-tions [35, 68], including marginalized communities only in preda-tory ways [53] or as “ethics washing” [112] (cf. Appendix §A foran extended critique of computational approaches to fairness).Participatory methods address some of these limitations. Involv-ing users as co-designers holds great potential for dismantlingpower relations and empowering marginalized communities thatare disproportionately impacted by AI [9, 74, 119]. Reflexivity inparticipatory methods encourages transparency during the designprocess itself, as opposed to a detrimental “innovate first, fix later”approach to building trustworthy AI [48]. By establishing the value-laden nature of technologies, it can prevent personal biases, beliefsand values from seeping into AI systems unexamined.Unfortunately, there are many challenges to incorporating par-ticipatory approaches across top-down structures, such as corpora-tions that operate within capitalism. Popular modes of participationwithin AI suffer from extractive and exploitative forms of commu-nity involvement or “participation washing” [112]. For example,a recent report [95] sheds light on how OpenAI used exploitativelabor practices to make ChatGPT less toxic, subjecting Kenyanworkers to psychologically distressing content1 without sufficientprovision for mental health support. Gray and Suri [56] also uncov-ers many exploitative labor practices performed by minorities topower AI systems.More fundamentally, we question whether marginalized com-munities should engage in designing with the creators of harmfulAI systems that prioritize profit over their safety. Even in projectswhere communities are involved, engagement is too often limited1This content included examples of sexual abuse, hate speech, violence, murder, childabuse, rape, animal abuse, torture and self-harm.in scope and time. Contrary to participation being controlled bythe corporations and states the design and own AI, we argue in thefavor of shifting power towards marginalized groups and centeringtheir experiences. We call for a culture of participation in AI toaddress this, one that enables deep and long-term participation inAI research, institutions, and practices.Over the years, the AI community has witnessed severalcommunity-led efforts from marginalized communities, eachtackling issues of inequality that arise along various axes ofmarginalization; these include Black in AI [12], LatinX in AI [77],Women in Machine Learning [133], Masakhane [84], WideningNLP [130], Diversity in AI [36], Indigenous in AI [64], Queer inHCI [34], the Indigenous Protocol and AI Working Group [79], theDeep Learning Indaba [31], Khipu [73], North Africans in ML [91],{Dis}Ability in AI [63], Te Hiku Media [47], and Muslims in ML [88].These organizations have worked in AI ethics, advocated againstAI harms, provided longstanding venues and visibility for AIethics research within major ML and NLP conferences, resolvedinclusion issues with those venues, and developed community-leddatasets, models, and other technology. Most importantly, theyhave advanced participation by marginalized communities in AIresearch and development at large, nurturing countless researchersand practitioners with community, mentorship, financial aid,and innumerable other forms of help with the many barriersmarginalized people face in AI. These groups have made AI muchmore diverse, and strengthened the voices of marginalized peoplewithin AI.In this work, we argue that AI ethicists who value participatorymethods as a means for making ethical AI should engage with par-ticipatory and community-lead AI ethics organizations, and studytheir organizational, strategic, and administrative work throughwhich they are advancing participation and building cultures ofparticipation. This often difficult process involves navigating thecomplexities of combining inquiry with praxis, and sheds light ondifferences between participatory approaches.To this end, we offer a case study analyzing Queer in AI, a grass-roots organization that aims to raise awareness of queer issues inAI/ML, foster a community of queer researchers and celebrate thework of queer scientists. Operating primarily as an online com-munity over Slack, the organization runs various programs andinitiatives towards fulfilling its mission. We analyze and critiqueits principles, methodology, initiatives, and impact over the yearsas a case study of community-led participatory methods in AI.Our key contributions are:• We document salient forms of marginalization and oppres-sion that particularly affect queer people (§2).• We present the organizing principles and programs of Queerin AI (§3), including how they started, major changes, andqualitative and quantitative analyses of impacts (§4).• We analyze challenges and shortcomings of Queer in AI (§5).• We present an argument for conducting more and valuingAI ethics research that combines inquiry and praxis (§6).Positionality Statement Most authors of this paper are formallytrained as computer scientists, with some also having training ingender theory or related fields.

The framing and use ofcommon AI systems that interact with gender are thus often prob-lematic, and inherently cisnormative and heteronormative, so thateven well-meaning, purportedly inclusive AI projects are proneto “designing out” certain queer lives [59]. Documented harmsacross various AI applications are numerous, and sometimes life-threatening. These include physiognomic and phrenologic appli-cations such as computer vision to (falsely) infer gender and sexu-ality [4, 70, 72, 80, 107, 108, 118]. AI-enabled surveillance systems,in conjunction with surveillance of online spaces such as datingapps by states, corporations, and even individuals have outed queerpeople, compromising their privacy and safety [22, 61, 92, 94]. On-line spaces, especially social media platforms, have insufficientand poorly explained privacy and security tools, requiring com-munity education and adaptation to meet the needs of queer peo-ple [33, 54, 96]. Their moderation enables widespread censorshipof queer words and identities [30, 43, 111, 113], while also sub-jecting queer communities to disproportionate online harassmentand hate speech [97, 125]. Some of these harms can be traced tolarge language models (LLMs) trained on datasets containing hatespeech and censored queer words, leading search systems to avoidqueer content and content moderation systems to more often tag itas suspect [37, 55]. LLMs also overwhelmingly fail to account fornon-binary genders and pronouns, contributing to erasure of theseidentities [17, 32].In the US, queer people are (at least) 20% less represented inSTEM than in the national population, and experience higher lev-els of “career limitations, harassment, and professional devalua-tion” [19]. Consequently, queer scientists often face “systematicallymore negative workplace experiences than their non-LGBT col-leagues” [20], and “leave STEM at an alarming rate” [51]. Theexclusion of queer people from science comes with significantconsequences, both for queer scientists and queer people furthermarginalized by fields that do not understand or care about them.The medical profession’s response to the HIV/AIDS crisis was fa-tally slow until pressured by heroic activism [110]; a medical fieldthat had included and empowered queer people may have savedmany queer lives. Similarly, the American Psychiatric Associationclassified homosexuality as a mental illness until 1973, greatly con-tributing to the stigmatization of queer people around the world,until queer activists pressured the group for change [38]. Recent ini-tiatives have inverted this dynamics, centering queer communitiesin descisions about mental healthcare [74].One hurdle in understanding the marginalization of LGBTQIA+people in STEM is a lack of demographic data on sexual orientationand gender identity [51]. The US’s National Science Foundation hasdelayed the collection of such data for years, despite the urging ofqueer scientists [76]. Taking matters into its own hands, Queer in AIadministers an annual survey of its global community to uncoverthe demographics and challenges faced by queer researchers inAI (discussed in detail in Appendix §B). In Queer in AI’s 2021-22community survey (𝑁 = 252), 74% of members reported a lack ofrole models and 77% reported a lack of community as obstacles intheir journey of becoming an AI practitioner.There is a dire lack of studies and data on queer scientists’ ex-periences in the Global South, where colonial histories have ledto the criminalization of queerness [1–3]. Queer in AI organizersfrom Turkey, Colombia, and India have shared that much queeractivism in these countries focuses on survival and gaining basichuman rights, recognition and respect in society, amid high levelsof discrimination, violence, and psychological distress [23]. Theyperceive being out and working towards queer visibility in STEMfields to be beyond luxuries, especially given the dominant (cisnor-mative, heteronormative) view that identity and profession shouldbe “kept separate.” Barriers to acceptance are only amplified forqueer individuals also marginalized on intersecting axes like classor caste.3 CORE PRINCIPLES OF QUEER IN AIThree governing principles drive Queer in AI’s mission to raiseawareness of queer issues in AI and foster a community of queerresearchers: (i) decentralized organizing, (ii) intersectionality, and(iii) community-led initiatives. Overall, Queer in AI’s decentralizedoperations allow for swift community-led initiatives towards itsmission (§3.1), which center on intersectionality as critical inquiryand praxis (§3.2). In doing so, it acknowledges and continuouslyworks to account for “the complexities of multiple, competing, fluid,and intersecting identities” [58]. Queer in AI’s primary approach1885Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USAconsists of including people with diverse lived experiences in par-ticipatory schemes (§3.3).3.1 Participation and DecentralizationFor its first two years, Queer in AI had a hierarchical structure,with a president and officers. However, organizing and governanceof grassroots communities, and especially queer communities,presents unique challenges. Queer people are incredibly diverse,and choosing one or even a group of queer people to representthe community as a whole is reductive and impossible. This is alsodifficult for the organizers, with high-profile queer activists andorganizers frequently facing targeted harassment campaigns, andQueer in AI organizers frequently reporting lack of time, externalsupport, or recognition for volunteering (cf. Figure A16). Queer inAI thus adopted a decentralized organizing structure, to encouragebroad participation. Queer in AI minimizes distinctions betweenorganizers and members to encourage the entire community toparticipate in organizing. Most volunteer coordination occursin the same Slack channel as is used for community discussion,calls for help or feedback on programs mixed with memes,introductions, personal news, and discussions of travel or pets. Ofthe 49 active Slack channels only 4, where personally identifiableinformation is discussed, are not public. Openness and embeddingin the community increase transparency and accountability: anycommunity member can view organizing discussions and joinin, with no more barrier to entry than joining a Slack channel.It also helps provide the connection and joy for which 75%of its organizers joined Queer in AI (cf. Figure A15). Fluiditybetween member and organizer also makes it easier for communitymembers’ areas and levels of engagement to ebb and flow overtime without losing their connection to the community.3.2 Participation and IntersectionalityOver five years, Queer in AI’s community has grown to about 870members, geographically distributed across more than 47 coun-tries (cf. Figure 2). The community members have diverse identitiesacross axes such as ethnicity, gender, class, disability, and caste.About 20.3% of respondents identified as transgender, and 34.4%identified as non-cisgender; 34.9% identified as Black, Latinx, in-digenous or a person of color; less than 2% identified as intersex.Membership spans academia and industry, with about 16% of mem-bers pursuing an undergraduate degree, 21% in an industry role,and 64% in academia, all with varying degrees of seniority (cf. Ap-pendix §B.6 for additional details of community demographics). Asa result, Queer in AI helps naturally bridge otherwise insular aislesof power and social contexts.As the queer community consistently experiences discrimina-tion, stigmatization, and inequity [18, 87], Queer in AI uses thelens of intersectionality as a means of critical inquiry to identifyhow interlocking forms of oppression, such as racism and sexism,co-construct and exacerbate social and structural disparities [26].To proactively dismantle injustices, Queer in AI centers the experi-ences of its members so that active participation in the Queer in AIcommunity results in the co-creation of initiatives, which reflectof tackling such barriers, including economic (§5.3), educational(§4.1), and social (§4.2) ones. By prioritizing fighting intersectionaloppression, Queer in AI attempts to empower its most marginalizedmembers to shape and control its programming, addressing keychallenges of participatory design such as the exclusion of marginal-ized people from participation [69], community power-sharing [27]and the co-formation of knowledge [45]. In doing so, Queer in AIworks towards a system of resistant knowledge firmly grounded inintersectionality’s critical praxis [25, Chs. 3 & 4].3.3 Participation and Community Leadership3.3.1 Research. Various forms of community-engaged researchguide the dissemination of knowledge both within and outsideof Queer in AI and exist across a continuum, from community-informed to community-involved to community-led. Community-informed research consists of researchers inviting the communityto incorporate lived experience to guide research questions, datacollection, or data interpretation [60]. Towards more community-involved research, community members may be more involvedin decision-making processes and research planning [60, 105]. Atthe highest level of engagement, community-driven approachessuch as community-based participatory action research (PAR) cen-ters shared collaborative decision-making between researchers andcommunity members across research design, knowledge creation,intervention development, and policy-making [28, 82, 126]. In prac-tice, entities outside of the organization may partner with Queerin AI community members to form relationships designed to helpobjectives oriented towards investigating and supporting “the pur-suit of answers to the questions of their daily struggle and survival”[121]. Individuals are often members of both other entities as wellas of Queer in AI so that members may operate from the role ofan external entity (e.g. researcher from a company) and at vari-ous depths of community engagement. The resulting knowledgeproduction is such that is “by the people, for the people” in whichresearch is not only seen as a process to create knowledge butto also educate and mobilize for action [28, 57]. By “putting com-munity first”, the distinction between participant and researcheris removed. Community-based participatory action research thusalso serves as a decolonizing epistemological framework whichinherently interrogates power and privilege [46].3.3.2 Response & resilience. Within Queer in AI, community re-silience operates across dimensions including but not limited to thesocial, political, and economic. Advocacy efforts operate across do-mains, tasks, resources, and activities within the organization [75].Resources and activities are structural means towards tasks anddomains that reflect the Queer in AI mission. Specifically, resourcesand activities are dedicated to raising awareness of queer issues inAI/ML. Financial, educational, and social avenues are created withinthe organization as a form of creating resilience and advocacy inthe face of oppressive sociotechnical barriers. Operating across 47countries, Queer in AI primarily organizes through Slack, Zoom, adedicated mailing list, and social media platforms. Doing so makesroom for rapid and adaptive situational awareness within the onlinecommunity [117]. Besides the “internal” milieu of an organization,Queer in AI is responsive to events in both reactive and proactiveforms. Digital volunteer efforts emerge as self-organizing responsesto external factors [24, 42]. This work further details examples of1886FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA Organizers of Queer in AI, et al.Figure 2: Country of origin of the respondents to the Queer in AI’s 2021–2022 demographic survey.Table 1: Self-reported ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation of the respondents to the Queer in AI’s 2021–2022 demographicsurvey.

Mostof Queer in AI’s communication is mediated by its Slack workspace.A key aspect of Queer in AI’s organizing lies in the transparencyof its operations and associated information exchanges, which pre-dominantly take place over public Slack channels. There are onlyfour private channels on the workspace, which exist to preserveprivacy while facilitating discussions around personally identifi-able information. The workspace has included the exchange ofover 133,000 messages (including individuals’ one-to-one privatemessages), of which over 25,000 have been sent in public channels,accounting for the majority (57%) of total views. This transparency,in conjunction with regular updates and outreach on Slack, keepscommunity members involved in ongoing events and initiatives.Many of Queer in AI’s initiatives have emerged from conversa-tions and threads on public channels about discriminatory experi-ences with different institutions. For example, discussion aroundexclusionary gender collection practices on conference registrationforms led to the creation of an inclusive conference guide (coveredin more detail in §4.3) and substantial improvements to relevantconferences’ practices. Similarly, significant advocacy against dead-naming in citations and conference proceedings (§4.4) began fromdiscourse on public channels. Thus, as a space, Queer in AI’s Slack iseffective at mobilizing community-led initiatives through decentral-ized organizing. Moreover, the emergence of these initiatives fromdiverse yet intersecting shared queer experiences grounds themin global contexts of social inequality and injustice. For instance,Queer in AI’s graduate school application financial aid program(§4.1) and workshops and socials (§4.2) target several particularchallenges rooted in non-Western contexts, centering otherwise-marginalized experiences. The organizational and volunteer workthat constitutes the administration of all these initiatives is thusdeeply intersectional.1887Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USAWe now examine four major initiatives in detail; Appendix §Cfurther describes efforts in policy advocacy.4.1 Graduate School Application Financial AidProgramQueer folks report a lack of community and queer role models dueto the underrepresentation of senior queer folks in academia. Thus,supporting queer and low-income scholars financially helps bringmore marginalized voices into STEM academia, creating more op-portunities for participatory research and technology design. Toaddress this, Queer in AI launched the Graduate School Applica-tion Fee Aid Program to improve queer representation and makegraduate programs accessible.4.1.1 Financial challenges. The costs for graduate school applica-tions prevent many low-income and international scientists fromaccessing graduate programs, well before they can benefit frommany of the fellowships and need-based scholarships intended toaddress exclusion. This process is costly: between the applicationfees (∼$50–$150 USD per program in North America and parts ofEurope), costs of required tests (e.g. GRE), test results and tran-script delivery fees, and test preparation expenses, one round ofapplications can easily amount to over $1,000 USD. Internationalapplicants may be further required to pay for language proficiencytests (e.g. TOEFL), translation services, and third-party credentialvetting. Although some schools offer fee waivers, they vary widelyfrom school to school, are often very limited in applicability, andcan require onerous documentation.The majority of applicants apply to North American schools.This is likely caused by the cultural dominance of Anglo-Americanschools in the AI/ML space and the common practice of requiringextensive standardized tests and application fees at these schools.2Standardized tests like the GRE claim to level the playing field forapplicants, they institute barriers to individuals from the GlobalSouth and reify colonialism under a veneer of fairness. Addition-ally, fees make these exams wholly inaccessible to many in theGlobal South: the GRE costs three times the average monthly salaryin Ethiopia [11]. Data collected from Queer in AI’s surveys havebeen used to argue that departments should eliminate the GRE andapplication fees.These financial challenges are particularly likely to be insur-mountable for queer scientists, who may be cut off from familialfinancial support, might pay out of pocket for gender-affirminghealthcare, and often incur additional expenses managing oppres-sion and trauma. Queer people thus suffer from increased studentloan debt [83] and high rates of housing insecurity [131]. A com-plete critique of the graduate application process and its socio-economical context is out of the scope of this paper. Queer in AIbelieves it is nonetheless important to provide concrete aid rightnow to applicants faced with the current system.4.1.2 Mutual aid design. The design of the aid program is decentral-ized, community-led constituting volunteers with a diverse range2While fees and standardized tests are the norms at many prominent institutions,there are examples of alternative paths, such as the ELLIS PhD Program, a Europeaninitiative for AI/ML PhD programs, which requires neither [44].of experiences with graduate school admissions [114]. This initia-tive keeps minimum barriers to receiving the aid by not seekingto decide who is “deserving” of aid, avoiding imposing excessiverequirements for documenting eligibility and providing timely men-torship and help to the applicants for their submissions. Although,the payment pipeline often disadvantages applicants from coun-tries and territories where PayPal is not available or restrictionsare imposed on receiving transfers from the US.4.1.3 Participatory learnings. Each aid applicant is treated as amember of the community with a valuable perspective of theirown – the initiative actively seeks feedback from aid recipientsand encourages them to volunteer in the future, which would bothhelp improve the program and keep it sustainable. This feedbackindicated that aid recipients’ demographics were more diverse thanQueer in AI’s organizing team (Table 3), which helps Queer in AIrecruit more diverse volunteers and community members by firstdirectly, meaningfully helping them. Also, the feedback survey il-lustrates widespread deficiencies in existing admissions fee waivers:such as lack of fee waivers (67%), unable to produce adequate docu-mentation (14%) and the fear of outing themselves (10%). This aidprogram allowed recipients to take admissions tests (56%), avoidskipping essential expenses (54%) and avoid skipping groceries orbills (40%). The vast majority of recipients reported the scholar-ship enabled them to apply to additional programs (around 6 onaverage).4.1.4 Critical Reflections. The program operates with a tensionbetween opening opportunities to marginalized people from allover the world and reinforcing the exclusionary practices of thesepowerful institutions. In addition to funding influential and richacademic institutions, the program also indirectly supports thestandardized testing industry. The limited amount of funds andbarriers to sending the money internationally often pose challengesbetween the organizers and the aid recipients. In spite of that, Queerin AI believes that it is crucial to provide timely aid regardless ofthese barriers, even if doing so reinforces undesirable structures.4.2 Workshops and SocialsIn STEM disciplines, conferences can be a hostile setting for minori-tized groups [85, 104, 134]. Queer in AI members in 2022 rated howwelcome they felt attending AI conferences at 3.38 on average (`1/2= 3) on a five-point Likert scale (cf. Appendix § B). Recognizingthis need, Queer in AI has organized workshops and networkingevents since its very first informal meetup at NeurIPS 2017: as ofsubmission, 13 workshops and 35 social events in total (Table 4),with a cumulative attendance of hundreds of participants.3 Theseevents provide an opportunity to connect and network with otherqueer scientists, spotlight work by members of Queer in AI, hosttalks on topics relevant to its members, and arrange panels whereexperts discuss topics at the intersection of AI, fairness, ethics, andthe queer community. The following subsections cover how Queerin AI’s principles influence event planning and enable them toovercome challenges in the process.3An exact count could not be obtained: to maintain attendees’ privacy, Queer in AIdoes not require signups for most events, and deletes names immediately after eventswhen they are required.1888FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA Organizers of Queer in AI, et al.Table 2: The Queer in AI Graduate School Application Fee Aid Program budget and impact per academic year, in USD.Academic year Aid per applicant No. aid recipients Total aid Budget2020/2021 up to $750 31 $16,689 $20,0002021/2022 up to $1,250 81 $70,607 $73,7682022/2023 (at time of writing) up to $1,250 48 $40,476 $41,711Table 3: Gender, sexual orientation, romantic orientation and continent of scholarship recipients who filled the optionalfeedback survey (𝑛 = 46 out of 𝑁 = 160 total recipients).

Queer in AI workshops and socialsare typically organized by members of the community planningto attend the conference; no prior academic or organizing expe-rience is required. Junior or new members of the community areoften encouraged to lead these initiatives while being mentored bymore experienced organizers throughout the process. Organizers,DEIAs, and Queer in AI’s financial stewards coordinate to securelogistical, monetary and other miscellaneous needs of the event.These include renting equipment to support accessibility, honorariafor speakers, scholarships for attendees, refreshments for socials,online outreach and promotion of the event, and so on. All of thiscommunication takes place asynchronously over Slack, or in Zoommeetings scheduled across organizers’ time zones. This decentral-ized approach also helps enable Queer in AI members spanningdifferent sub-fields in AI to tailor events to represent and servethe needs of their sub-community. When prompted to rate howwelcome they felt at these workshops, the response was overwhelm-ingly positive, with about 47% of queer attendees rating it five outof five on a Likert scale (`=4.16, `1/2=4) (cf. Appendix § B6).4.2.2 Panels and Talks at Workshops. Panels and talks at Queer inAI are crucial as they help in amplifying queer voices and concernsin our field. Many topics presented in the panels and keynotes havelater served a bigger impact in the AI field, such as talks on confer-ence inclusivity and name change policies. Queer in AI encouragesa participatory approach to workshop design: by soliciting topicsand speaker ideas from community workspace. This approach hasallowed Queer in AI to host panels and talks on intersectional topicsthat often do not have a presence at major AI/ML venues (for justone example, a discussion on the intersection of queerness, casteand AI at NeurIPS 2021 [99]). Queer in AI organizers spend tremen-dous effort by making the workshops as inclusive as possible byproviding fair honoraria to the speakers and organizing the eventsin online, hybrid, and in-person settings.4.2.3 Barriers and Challenges in Participation. AI conferences areoften not accessible for a sizable portion of queer researchers, espe-cially those belonging to other marginalized backgrounds or fromcountries with lower purchasing power or higher rates of discrimi-nation towards queer people [127]. Primary reasons includes highregistration and travel costs. Out of all Queer in AI members whoreported being unable to attend conferences owing to lack of fund-ing, 88% identified as one of black, indigenous, person of color,transgender, neurodivergent, or disabled (cf. Appendix § B6). WhileQueer in AI tries to work with conference organizers to use DEIfunds for increasing the attendance of queer scientists, in manycases conference organizers refuse to engage with Queer in AI’srequests. Queer in AI thus often provides a combination of travelgrants, registration waivers, and reimbursement for conference-related expenses to queer AI researchers. In other cases, unofficial1889Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USAsocial events4 near the conference venue and online virtual so-cials on gather.town are organized to accommodate excluded timezones and overcome both financial and geographical access barriers.Other barriers specific to the conference location, such as unsafelegal and social climates 5 for queer people or exclusionary visaprocesses, continue to significantly limit queer participation withinAI spaces. Finally, for conferences which are poorly equipped intheir support for disabled people, Queer in AI provides live captionsfor all in-person and virtual events, and secures equipment to createaccessible spaces.4.3 Advocacy for Improving Queer Inclusivityin ConferencesAs conferences moved online in response to the COVID-19 pan-demic, Queer in AI organizers noted a series of operational failuresthat could cause queer attendees to feel unsafe or unwelcome. Regis-tration platforms demanded attendees to provide their legal names,thus potentially deadnaming them; the use of pronoun badges forspeakers and attendees was rarely encouraged, or platforms didnot support displaying pronouns; virtual chat software blockedcommon queer terms such as “queer” or “lesbian”, thus preventingqueer attendees from communicating freely. Queer in AI organizersworked closely with many conferences to resolve these issues, asthey had in prior settings (§4.2), and ultimately decided to collectrecommendations aimed at highlighting best practices to ensuresafety, privacy, and accessibility for queer attendees at academicconferences in AI in a collected guidance document.6These recommendations began based on existing best practicesand experience with conference organizers, but were refinedthrough extensive iterative feedback from members of Queer inAI and other affinity groups, incorporating many opinions andultimately achieving consensus among a broad group of contribu-tors. The guide has recently been expanded to also cover in-personevents as conferences move to hybrid or in-person formats.This queer advocacy to improve inclusivity covers two aspects:improving queer safety and increasing queer representation.4.3.1 Improving Queer Safety: As in any public space, queerconference-goers might face discrimination based on their genderand sexual orientation. Therefore, it is paramount for attendeesto be able to control what information they wish to discloseto the organizers and attendees of a conference. Queer in AIadvocates mechanisms to (i) respect attendees’ identities bycollecting gender and pronoun information in a manner that doesnot misrepresent or erase queer identities, by creating forms withinclusive gender categories and disclosing the data usage [106] (ii)minimize the amount of personal information queer individualshave to disclose [7] (for example, only collecting legal nameswhen absolutely necessary, and using responses about the gender4These events are not officially included within the conference program but promotedover Queer in AI’s Slack and mailing list as well as social media. A recent example isAAAI 2023 where the conference fees was exorbitantly high and negligible effort wasput into provision for registration waivers.5EMNLP 2022 (in Abu Dhabi) predatorily included Queer in AI to obtain their approvalfor conference safety measures; Queer in AI rejected this, due to the conferenceoperating at a different domain of power for trans people and the power inherent inspeaking for the entire queer community.6The guide, originally published as [101], is a living document available atqueerinai.com/how-to-make-virtual-conferences-queer-friendly.and sexuality of attendees only for statistical purposes and inanonymized form); and (iii) ensure that mechanisms to reportdisruptive or harmful behaviours are swift and effective. Queer inAI recommends adopting a code of conduct (e.g., [100, 132]) to notonly establish communication norms, but also describe how policyviolations are handled [39].4.3.2 Increasing Queer Representation and Participation: Queer re-searchers’ needs are regularly ignored in many aspects of the re-search community: challenges include lack of academic support,hostility from colleagues and advisors, inflexible name change poli-cies, lack of representation in the research itself, and more [21].Stronger inclusion efforts, both for representation and participa-tion, can work towards addressing a lack of queer community androle models [109]. To increase representation, Queer in AI stronglyencourages conference organizers to invite queer keynote speakersand panelists, prioritizing those from marginalized backgrounds(e.g., BIPOC or non-cisgender) [40]. Queer in AI recommends fairand equal compensation based on effort rather than seniority forall speakers [52, 103]. As noted in previous sections, financial acces-sibility and a lack of community were the main barriers for queerfolks to feel included at conferences. Queer in AI strongly advocatessetting up spaces for queer folks to network and socialize with pri-vacy measures and also providing subsidies for queer researchersto attend virtual or in-person events.4.3.3 Critical Reflection. This guide and advocacy are not withouttheir limitations. Most recommendations are still focused on vir-tual spaces and currently written guide lacks in-depth accessibilityrecommendations. Queer in AI needs to collaborate with disabledfolks with a wider range of disabilities to document best practicesregarding accessibility accommodations. Most significantly, despiteorganizers’ efforts the guide has seen relatively modest adoption.4.4 Trans-inclusive Publishing AdvocacyFor many transgender, non-binary, and gender-diverse scholars(as well as others), the continued circulation of a previous namein publishing is a significant source of trauma [122]. Referring toan author by a previous name without consent (deadnaming) mayeffectively out their identity against their will. Queer in AI hasworked along with the Name Change Policy Working Group [89]to advocate name change policies in AI venues, helping to establishthe name-change policies and procedures now adopted by mostAI-related venues [5, 6, 14, 15, 62, 78, 90, 123] (cf. Appendix § C formore about Queer in AI’s advocacy and impact).Even publishers with functional name change policies are oftenwoefully slow to implement them, and search engines can indexoutdated information long after its correction [115, 116]; moreover,authors often use outdated bibliographic entries long after relevantpublications and search tools have been updated [120]. It is thusvital to check the correctness of citations in submitted papers toavoid propagating incorrect information. QueerInAI has thus devel-oped a tool to check paper PDFs for mistaken citations. It searchesthe ACL Anthology, DBLP, and arXiv for a close paper title match,and prompts a correction if the paper’s author list disagrees withthat source, detecting both deadnaming and incomplete or outdated1890FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA Organizers of Queer in AI, et al.author lists. DBLP in particular provides better name change sup-port than many other platforms, via ORCID [93]. This toolkit hasbeen integrated into ACL publication camera-ready systems [98],and Queer in AI hopes to expand it to other conferences. A demois available at qinai-name-check.streamlit.app.Additionally, Queer in AI advocates publishers to promptly grantname correction requests in any format, without unnecessary bar-riers or documentation requirements. Such changes should removeall instances of authors’ previous names from all records, or (atthe author’s discretion) add disclaimers for media that cannot beupdated (e.g., audio or video recordings). As the result of this ad-vocacy, Queer in AI has helped institute effective name-changeprocesses at NAACL and EMNLP; and has worked with the Asso-ciation for Computational Linguistics [49] to implement a namechange process, proactive measures to prevent the deadnaming oftrans authors, and protocols to handle authors’ requests to keeptheir videos private.5 TENSIONS AND CHALLENGESAs reflexivity is a core tenet of intersectionality [25], this sectioncritically examines the tensions and challenges that emerge in theoperationalization of Queer in AI’s principles within its initiatives.From the issues with Queer in AI initiaitves discussed in the pre-vious section, we find three common, root themes of hierarchy,accessibility, and funding. We argue that these are not only criti-cal challenges for Queer in AI, but deep challengesany participatoryor community-lead AI organization must address to be successful.5.1 HierarchyDecentralized organizing plays a vital role in minimizing powerdistance and distinctions between members of Queer in AI. Even so,there are notable distinctions between members who participatein organizing, core organizers, and the DEIAs as paid contractors.Queer in AI’s core organizers and DEIAs help sustain the growth ofthe organization through mentorship of new volunteers and institu-tional memory. In addition, they form a relatively large and diversegroup for deliberating on rare decisons that cannot be discussedopenly, such as those involving PII. Their existence does, however,pose challenges in accessibility for people unfamiliar with navi-gating unstructured social networks, and can be non-transparentto newer or less involved members. The core organizers also as-sume a more active role, sharing considerable power in steeringthe direction of its initiatives. Queer in AI helps address these ten-sions by setting a fixed one-year tenure for DEIAs, and inductingorganizers who have been active throughout the preceding yearas core organizers. Resolving tensions between decentralizationand hierarchies created by knowledge and experience, or forcedby privacy concerns, nonetheless remains an open problem withinQueer in AI.5.2 AccessibilityDespite global participation, Queer in AI’s structure and opera-tional design can discourage participation for many queer scien-tists. First, participation in a volunteer-run community not onlyrequires organizers to have income that allows them to performfree labor but also have access to computers, internet, and otherresources required to even connect with Queer in AI. Second, whileQueer in AI strives to be intersectional, it severely lacks access toqueer networks in countries from the Global South. It originatedand primarily operated within a Western context during its initialyears, which led to the inadvertent creation of barriers that limitits outreach. For example, because Queer in AI organizers are bestconnected with US and European institutions, its events are oftenco-located at conferences attended mainly by scientists residing inthe Global North. Further, its meetings often occur at times bestaligned with European and American time zones, at the expenseof much of Asia. Finally, all Queer in AI activities require Englishproficiency.While recent community and focused outreach efforts have re-duced some of these barriers, significant work lies ahead in estab-lishing truly global ways of participation, especially for countrieswhere queerness is criminalized. Third, participation in Queer inAI exerts a toll on mental health and exhaustion of its organizers(cf. Figure A16). This is partly due to Queer in AI’s lack of formalstructure, instead relying on individuals self-coordinating on initia-tives of their choice. While efficient, this approach can make joiningand keeping track of ongoing efforts challenging for newcomersand neurodivergent members of the community. Past organizershave also shared anecdotes of experiencing exhaustion, fatigue, andanxiety due to a lack of accommodation of different working stylesand falling behind on personal schedules while undertaking opera-tional work for Queer in AI (cf. Figure A16). This disproportionatelyimpacts disabled and neurodivergent members and is compoundedfor intersecting marginalized identities.Even after years of critical reflection and significant investmentof volunteer time, money, and other resources, Queer in AI is stillinaccessible to many. While accessibility to everyone should alwaysbe the goal, in practice, no single community or participatory initia-tive will be able to include everyone in that community. Therefore,participatory researchers aspiring to broad inclusion should con-sider the pluralities of communities and participatory initiativeswith radically different structures.5.3 FundingFunding and payments are where Queer in AI struggles most tomeet its commitments to decentralization, intersectionality, andcommunity leadership. Queer in AI relies on sponsorships, dona-tions, and contributions from its parent organization oSTEM to fundits activities. In 2022, Queer in AI expenses (rounded to the closestinteger) totaled US$100,658: the graduate application fee scholar-ship program (§4.1) spent $40,435; two DEIA contractors were paida total of $33,220; speaker honoraria totaled $14,500; $6,941 wentto travel grants, room and board, and conference registration fees;emergency microgrants for queer people totaled $5,000. Incomecomprised $78,000 in corporate sponsorship, $13,711 in donations,and $5,000 in grant revenue (cf. Appendix §B.9 provides incomeand expenses for previous years.).Queer in AI’s reliance on corporate sponsorship may call intoquestion its independence and community-lead ideal. Corporatesponsors receive access to opt-in resume books, short speakingopportunities, and event recruiting booths. A large part of Queer1891Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI FAccT ’23, June 12–15, 2023, Chicago, IL, USAin AI’s funding still comes from big tech corporations that are com-plicit in oppression and genocide globally, such as the policing ofPalestinians. Queer in AI has nonetheless dropped and turned downmany sponsors for ethics concerns, including a mutual decisionwith Black in AI in 2021 to drop Google [65], costing $20,000 inlost sponsorship per year. While Queer in AI has been growingdonations, many in the Queer in AI community are students orearly in their careers with very limited capacity to give. Oppor-tunities for grants are limited, as many scientific funding bodiessuch as the US’s NSF exclude queer people from many of their D&Iinitiatives [50].Queer in AI sends honoraria, scholarships, and travel grants topeople in many different countries, primarily through PayPal andwires. Payment disbursal in Queer in AI is highly centralized; forreasons of security oSTEM only allows one Queer in AI organizerto send PayPal payments. All wires and credit card payments mustbe sent by the oSTEM CEO. Additionally, payments strain Queer inAI’s intersectional values. PayPal does not work well in China, In-dia, many countries in Africa, and some countries in South America,forcing reliance on slower and more administratively difficult wiretransfers. Moreover, U.S. law requires people receiving honorariaand other types of payments to pay US taxes above a certain thresh-old, which requires a lengthy registration process or significant feesand overhead from Queer in AI. Payments also frequently triggerspurious fraud alerts and investigations, which require even moretime from and stress on organizers.In summary, marginalization prefigures Queer in AI’s fundingoptions, legal and security concerns exert a strong centralizing pres-sure on financial administration, and the financial system regardsmany payments, especially to non-Western countries and thosemaking them, with suspicion by default.6 CONCLUSIONParticipatory methods have the potential to address issues of powerand inclusion in AI, but their benefits and challenges in practiceare still unclear because few organizations have deeply engagedwith them. In this paper we studied Queer in AI as a case studyof a grassroots participatory AI organization. We explored howthey designed their organization to enable participation, and howinitiatives addressing intersectional marginalization arose from andwere continuously refined by this participation. We theorized howQueer in AI’s numerous socials, workshops, and other events havecontributed to a culture of participation in AI by bringing queerpeople into AI conferences and research and industry settings andresisting predatory inclusion. We hope this case study will informtheoretical study and practical design of participatory initiatives. Inparticular, we encourage consideration of Queer in AI’s reinforcingprinciples of decentralization, community leadership, and focus onintersectionality, and urge care for mitigating the ways hierarchy,inaccessability, and funding can subvert participatory methods.6.1 Future DirectionsQueer in AI will continue to grapple with the tensions and alleviatethe challenges addressed in §5. To dismantle hierarchies amongorganizers created by knowledge, experienced Queer in AI orga-nizers will host structured trainings to onboard new organizersonto finance & sponsorships and workshops. Queer in AI addition-ally plans to supplement its 2023 community survey with commu-nity interviews about accessibility, towards gleaning actionableinsights about mitigating barriers to participation. Furthermore,Queer in AI’s organizers will work with its community to refine itssponsorship policies and identify less precarious mechanisms fortransferring funds. All of these activities are motivated and will beguided by our core principles of decentralization, intersectionality,and centering community. Queer in AI will further communicateits activities and their implications for equity and inclusivity viaaccessible media, e.g., blog posts, zines.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work would not have been possible without the activism andorganizing efforts of the Queer in AI community. We would alsolike to thank Katta Spiel and Os Keyes for their insightful feedbackon the earlier versions of the paper.REFERENCES[1] 2015.

    "abstract": "Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI.We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community’s programs over the years",
