    "abstract": "This discussion will explore the politics and ethics of citation. As academics, how, why, when, and whom do we cite, and what is at stake in these practices? Areas for discussion will include representation in disciplinary canons and the undercitation of scholars who are Black, Indigenous, People of Color, LGBTQ+, women, and members of multiply marginalized groups. By considering citation in the context of power and privilege, this panel will unpack what it means to adopt a critical approach to citation in our research, teaching, and scholarship.\nWatch the video to see the discussion.
