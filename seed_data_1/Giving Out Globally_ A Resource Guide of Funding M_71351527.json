These examples show how even modestly sized grants can have enormous impact in countries both large and small. Most of these organizations are less than 10 years old and have few or no paid staff members. Yet these groups are changing the conditions for LGBT people in significant ways.For the purposes of this report, the abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT, is intended to refer to the full spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities as they exist across cultures, regions of the world, and languages.We use the term “Global South” to refer to the countries located in Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, and the Middle East. We use the term “Global East” to refer to the countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The term “Global North” refers to the countries in North America and Western Europe.The Arcus Operating Foundation would like to thank the authors and participants for their thoughtful contributions to this report.1Whether you are an individual who wants to donate or staff of a funding institution, Giving Out Globally is intended to help you under-stand more about the variety of funding mechanisms available to support the growing LGBT rights sector in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and East-ern Europe. The first section explores the different types of funding mechanisms available to donors. The second section lists and describes international LGBT grant-making intermediaries. This guide is primarily directed at a U.S.-based audience, but we hope it will also be useful to interested funders around the world. Throughout this report, you will see examples of small and mid-sized organizations that are working to make the world a safer place for sexual minorities. These and hundreds of other similar groups represent a sector that deserves and is ripe for philanthropic investment. Giving Out Globally is intended to be a source of information and guidance about the mechanisms for giving to those wishing to provide this much-needed support.BackgroundIt has been widely noted that after Sept. 11, 2001, a dramatic shift in U.S. philanthropy occurred: international grantmaking began to grow almost twice as rapidly as the growth of total philanthropic dollars. Simultaneously during the last decade, organizations working on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues across the globe have proliferated dramatically — the average age of LGBT organizations in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe (Global South and East) is only seven years.Funding for this expanding movement is spectacularly scarce. The organizations working on the rights of sexual minorities in these regions of the world receive relatively little funding, yet are the engines of social change — working every day to eliminate abuse and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and working for legal and social equality.According to A Global Gaze, a report issued by Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, approximately US $10 million was spent in total on LGBT issues in the Global South and East in 2005,1 compared to US $336 million to support 48 LGBT rights organizations based only in the United States in the same year.2 Clearly, there is greater capacity and an opportunity to boost the level of LGBT funding to the Global South and East. Strategic support for groups working for LGBT rights in the Global South and East would increase possibilities to change anti-LGBT laws, create measures that protect against violence and discrimination, hold governments accountable for violence and hate crimes perpetrated because of sexual orientation and gender identity, educate the public about who LGBT people really are, and many other effective forms of organizing for basic human rights, that LGBT citizens deserve. A Quick Glance on the Statusof Global LGBT Rightsn Scores of countries regularly deny basic human rights on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity such as freedom of assembly, speech, and association, as well as the rights to be free from torture, arbitrary arrest, and violence. More than 80 countries in the world have anti-LGBT laws.n Only Belgium, Canada, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and South Africa allow same-sex couples full marriage rights. Only Ecuador, Fiji, Portugal, South Africa, Sweden, and Switzerland have embedded LGBT protections in their national constitutions. n Fifty-three percent of local LGBT organizations in the Global South and East work with annual budgets under US $10,000; one out of three organizations have no staff at all. Introduction1) Also note that of the $10M, less than half came from U.S. fund-ing sources, compared to $336M from the U.S. for the U.S. Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, A Global Gaze: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Grantmaking in the Global South and East, 2007.

Some philanthropists are inspired by a personal connection to a place or to an issue — whether due to travel experiences, business relations, friendships, involvement with a diasporic community (people who identify with a particular country or region, while living elsewhere), or other experiences. n Global HIV Epidemic. Many donors have contributed to fighting the global HIV epidemic and have seen the connection between the spread of disease and issues of stigma, powerlessness, and lack of rights. Support for LGBT communities in countries fighting HIV may seem a logical extension of their funding.n Opportunity. Some people are compelled by seeing a funding void and wanting to fill it. There is tremendous opportunity to make a very significant difference in the lives of large numbers of people by giving internationally. n “Bang for the Buck.” The dollar still goes a long way in many parts of the world. Even small grants can do amazing things in the Global South and East. Why Fund LGBT Rights Internationally?Some of the common reasons people feel compelled to give internationally:n Severity of Human Rights Abuses. News reports are often painful to read; photographs devastating to look at. Many people respond to horrific stories of human rights abuses by wanting to “do something,” including donating money. For LGBT people, there may be an additional sense that no one else will address these problems. n Global Inequity. Sometimes the relative financial privileges and opportunities that exist for those living in the Global North compel us to want to share with those in poorer countries — especially those who have access to few resources. n Global Interdependence. People increasingly realize that what happens in one part of the world affects other parts — whether due to globalization, climate issues, or social change crossing borders. The same is true for the LGBT rights movement. Religious extremist organizations of all sorts have international agendas that export homophobia, and LGBT organizations and activists have important lessons and models for change to share with one another. 3Each of the giving vehicles described in this guide is already a crucial engine to a growing LGBT rights movement worldwide — and each adds a slightly different dimension to this relatively new sector of philanthropy and to the global movement for LGBT equality. The range of options for donors wishing to channel support to LGBT issues internationally falls into the following categories:1. Supporting Northern-based LGBT organizations working in the Global South and East2. Using a funding intermediary to channel support to a local group3. Making cross-border grants directly or through a private foundation4. Opening a donor-advised fund that allows for cross-border giving5. Joining or creating a donor circle, study trip, or other collaborative giving vehicle 1. Supporting Northern-based LGBT organizations working in the Global South and EastSimplicity of Giving to LGBT Groups in theGlobal NorthFor readers based in the United States, giving to organizations based in the U.S. with 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status is a simple way to give. Because such organizations are granted tax-exempt status by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, donors usually need not do anything more than receive a letter from the organization acknowledging the gift, in order to receive the full tax benefits of supporting these organizations. Other due diligence or information gathering on the part of the donor — whether as an individual or institution — is less cumbersome when giving to an organization based in one’s own country, compared to giving across borders, which requires additional steps as described in detail in the next section. Similarly, for donors based in other countries, there can be utility to funding groups based in your own country for tax or other reasons. Funding MechanismsPembe Hayat LGBTT Solidarity Association (Ankara, Turkey)Year Formed: 2006Paid Staff: 0Annual Budget: very smallFunders: Mama Cash. Pembe was formed by a small group of transgender sex workers in Ankara, and is an all-volunteer organization working to educate Turkish society about homosexuality, transgender issues and sex worker rights. Pembe has begun to offer legal services to individuals whose rights are violated, and it is documenting and writing a report on the human rights abuses based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex worker status, to use for lobbying the government for protections. In a country that is hoping to become part of the European Union, and with a large Muslim population, an association supporting gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender organizing and educating is groundbreaking.GRANTEE PROFILEGifts with RestrictionsFor a Northern-based donor, funding an international LGBT organization in one’s own country does not normally facilitate direct information sharing or relationships with a grantee or partner organization located in the Global South or East. Nor does it easily facilitate a more defined philanthropic goal such as a focus on activities like decriminalization advocacy, or a defined geographic reach. Some of these organizations may take gifts that are restricted to a particular region or country in the world, and may be willing to take restricted purpose gifts for a particular strategy or program, depending on the intersection of donor interest with the goals and structure of the organization. But most of these organizations have small staffs attempting to accomplish a lot of work, and are not structured to be able to work that closely with a donor. Instead, they facilitate a broad range of advocacy activities in support of LGBT populations around the world: research and reporting, direct advocacy, grass-roots mobilization, education, and training. Some of these groups have multiple offices in different countries, while some have a single headquarters. They range from having a single staff member dedicated to LGBT issues, to having a complement of nearly 20 people. These groups usually keep donors engaged through newsletters, e-mail, action alerts, and face-to-face meetings. A few LGBT organizations in the Global South and East have established a “friends-of” organization in the United States or a similar entity in Europe. A “friends-of” organization is a nonprofit organization formed in the United States that is tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, receives charitable contributions, and makes grants directly to an organization outside of the United States for charitable purposes. Similarly, the leaders of a few LGBT organizations in the Global South and East have traveled on “fundraising tours” to either the U.S. or Europe, and organizations in the U.S. or Europe have functioned as temporary “fiscal sponsors” for donations collected during those trips. Both friends-of organizations and fiscal sponsors must exercise discretion and control over the funds they raise for organizations outside the United States and must not be mere conduits for the flow of funds to those organizations. Fortunately, there are now a number of excellent organizations based in the United States that work on a global level or with particular countries in the Global South and East — many of which operate their own LGBT rights programs overseas and work in partnership with local groups. They include the International Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC); Human Rights Watch’s LGBT Rights Program; Amnesty International-USA’s OutFront Program; Heartland Alliance’s Global Equality Network; and Global Rights’ LGBTI Initiative. In Canada, there is ARC International; in Europe there is the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA), and its European branch, the International Lesbian and Gay Association-Europe (ILGA-Europe). For the most part, these human rights organizations do not function as grantmakers, but rather work in partnership with organizations to support and amplify the work of the LGBT organizations in the Global South and East. The exceptions are Heartland Alliance, ILGA-Europe, and the COC-Netherlands (the Dutch national LGBT organization), which run specific small grantmaking programs as part of their overall efforts. This type of direct funding is most useful for a donor seeking simplicity, and for whom information filtered through the lens and strategy of a (relatively speaking) larger organization is welcome. What Is “Due Diligence”? For cross-border grants, due diligence goes beyond normal grantmaking best practices, such as a thorough review of the organization’s finances, goals and programs, governance, leadership, and proper use of grant funds. Cross-border grantmaking necessitates an even more thorough understanding and review of the legal options for charitable-purpose organizations in the country where the group is located, and obtaining English-language copies of organizational documents. It often involves seeking the advice of someone well versed in the particularities of the country (e.g., language, culture, politics), and ensuring that the legal requirements for tax-deductible giving of the U.S. are fulfilled before making a grant. 4“I like to support small grass-roots groups in poor regions because I know how difficult it is for them to get donations. I think it’s important to look for ways to give ongoing support and not just when there is a crisis. But I’ve found it difficult to fund groups in this way directly. So relying on a U.S. organization like IGLHRC to build relations with these groups is an excellent way to do this work. Also, if a group has a U.S. fiscal sponsor, this provides an opportunity for support, though many of the smaller groups would not be reachable in this way.”Paul Albert, individual donor supportingLGBT international issues and groups formore than 20 years  2. Using a funding intermediary to channel support to local groupsExamples of LGBT-Focused Intermediaries: Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, ILGA-EuropeExamples of Human Rights-Focused Intermediaries that Fund LGBT Groups: American Jewish World Service, Front Line Defenders, Global Fund for Women, Heart-land Alliance, Hivos, Mama Cash, Oxfam, and Urgent Action Fund. (See Resource Section for more information.)What Is an Intermediary?A “philanthropic intermediary” is a nonprofit organization or community foundation that provides specialized grantmaking services, in combination with particular expertise and knowledge about the issues, populations, or geography in question. These services are sometimes referred to as “re-granting” or as a “pass-through.” Sometimes the intermediary has offices or staff located in the countries or regions being funded. At minimum they have staff or advisers knowledgeable about the local situations to inform their grantmaking. Intermediaries can handle all of the legal complexities of making cross-border grants, which can include 5Labrys (Belgrade, Serbia)Year Formed: 1995Paid Staff: 6Annual Budget: $110,000Funders: Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Heart and Hand Fund, Hivos, Fund for an Open Society, Mama Cash, Swedish Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, Global Fund for Women, and Filia die Frauenstiftung. Labrys is the first lesbian group in the former Yugoslavia. It actively works as an anti-defamation organization for the LGBT community in Serbia. In addition to documenting anti-LGBT hate speech in the media, Labrys also creates media, including a newspaper, Web site, and library. Labrys attempted to stage a public pride march, but due to the extremely violent response by Serbian nationalists, it has ceased holding this event. Among Labrys’s many activities to reduce homophobia, it has petitioned the Serbian Medical Association to declassify homosexuality as a disease, along with working on legislation to recognize and protect LGBT rights.GRANTEE PROFILEwith other funds and directed to areas of need. By bringing together resources, these funds enable small foundations to have a greater impact without having to make the administrative investment themselves.”One of the most important benefits of using an intermediary for funding LGBT issues in the Global South and East is accessing a depth of expertise about LGBT issues and organizations in the particular countries and regions where funding is intended. An intermediary will have staff or adviser expertise necessary to identify appropriate grantees; navigate cultural, linguistic, religious, economic, and other differences; understand potential local conflicts, laws, and risks; and access networks and important local events. Some larger intermediaries, such as Hivos or Oxfam Novib in the Netherlands, are largely sustained though government funding, but nonetheless work with both public and private funding. They are able to have offices in different parts of the world with significant local and regional expertise. Other intermediaries that receive little to no government funding, such as Global Fund for Women, Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, and Mama Cash, have program staff who specialize in different parts of the world, as well as advisers (both paid and voluntary) who significantly inform the grantmaking process. With cross-border grantmaking, monitoring the grant and activities of the grantee can be complicated and costly. Such monitoring and assessment is important to ensure the grantees are getting the support they need and that the money is being used as planned, particularly in countries where there is a lot of desperation for economic resources. Such monitoring from the outside can actually help an organization build its own infrastructure. Intermediaries often have greater capacity, through their staff and advisers, to collect information, and evaluate and support their grantmaking success. Larger intermediaries may be able to provide a deeper level of reporting to a donor. Smaller intermediaries may be able to offer more flexibility about terms of the partnership. For some funders, it is simply too costly to make international grants or to make many small grants. For them, using an intermediary can be more efficient. Larger philanthropic institutions tend to make larger-sized grants in the issue areas that they fund, but many of the significant due diligence activities on each grant. For a U.S. donor, using a U.S.-based intermediary allows for the grants to be tax-deductible. Where intermediaries differ most is in the level of services they can provide both to the grantee and to the donor. For example, some intermediaries provide a significant amount of capacity-building support for the groups receiving the funds. This support can include regional convenings and trainings; flexibility in partnering with less-experienced or even “underground” organizations; and various types of staff advice and support on grantwriting and financial management. For the donors, intermediaries offer a variety of ways to keep them informed, educated, and engaged with the issues. This can be as simple as comprehensive reporting, or as involved as offering educational travel opportunities to learn firsthand about the concerns of LGBT people living in the Global South and East. Bob Buchanan, the director of international programs for the Council on Foundations, sums up the variety of services an intermediary can provide: “An intermediary can be an adviser, an administrator, and a grantmaker on your behalf. Some intermediaries are also program builders and network builders. They don’t just process grants. Topically focused intermediaries have their own strategies and objectives, and they fit your grant into that larger strategy. Other intermediaries are simply there to help you get your grant where you want it to go; they don’t have a particular strategy of their own, other than doing it in a professional and legal manner.”3Advantages of Using an IntermediaryRegardless of the type of services provided, there are many advantages to working with and through an intermediary. Since intermediaries are part of the philanthropic sector, they can collaborate with the few large, private funders making grants to this sector, such as the Ford Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, Arcus Foundation, and the U.K.’s Sigrid Rausing Trust. Similarly, they can help leverage a smaller funder’s money by pooling it with larger sources. Regan Ralph, executive director of the Fund for Global Human Rights, commented, “There are organizations whose work makes it possible for smaller donations to be pooled 63) Working with Intermediaries: Global Grant Making throughPartner Organizations, GrantCraft, 2007.Downloadable at www.grantcraft.org.LGBT rights groups in the Global South and East are unable to absorb such influxes of support. The depth of due diligence and partnership required with each grantee makes it difficult for large philanthropic institutions to give multiple small-sized grants. On the other hand, smaller philanthropic institutions often cannot take on the extra due-diligence work that international grantmaking requires, because they don’t have adequate staffing resources. To support LGBT organizations in the Global South and East in particular, providing smaller grants to relatively small organizations is an effective funding strategy. Research by Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues strongly suggested that what is needed are more small, multiyear grants for these relatively young grass-roots organizations: “Small grants and increased multiyear support could nourish the LGBTI infrastructure of organizations in the Global South and East, which tend to operate on small incomes and few to no staff members. Grantmakers whose funding parameters dissuade them from supporting smaller organizations by offering small grants (or not offering larger multiyear grants) should strengthen their relationships with groups that regrant to adequately support the infrastructure of LGBTI groups in the Global South and East.”4 Not all LGBT organizations in the Global South and East, however, are new and small. There are some with the absorptive capacity for larger grants. Hivos and Heartland Alliance’s Global Equality Network make longer-term commitments and larger grants to the groups they fund. On the other hand, helping a small group scale up significantly is likely to take a multiyear commitment on the part of the funder, along with close attention to the capacity-building needs of the group. A funder can inadvertently harm the organization by giving too much money too quickly. For example, in a country with significant economic desperation, a startup organization without sufficient financial safeguards and accountability standards may easily become a target of theft or inappropriate expenditures. Some groups will be able to absorb larger funding and make greater impact in their country or region. Funding these LGBT organizations with larger, multiyear grants is also part of an effective funding strategy to this sector. 74) Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, A Global Gaze: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Grantmaking in the Global South and East, 2007.

LaLa is a leadership development camp that began in 2007 for Mandarin-speaking lesbian activists. It was so successful in bringing together Chinese lesbians from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the U.S. to Zhuhai, China, for a four-day retreat and training that this year the camp will go on a five-city tour throughout Mainland China. Thirty percent of the activists from the first LaLa camp went on to start up groups in their hometowns. This program is part of Common Language, an organization for lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women in China. Small grants have helped this organization reach thousands of lesbians, bisexual, and transgender women in the most-populous country in the world.GRANTEE PROFILE“I chose Astraea because I trusted the individuals involved, and because they have their institutional values in place. I had no interest in pushing a Western-style LGBTI agenda upon the rest of the world, so I was looking for an organization that acknowledges — even seeks — difference, and is self-reflective when it comes to ideology, like keeping open the question of who or what a lesbian is and how she defines herself. I also saw the advantages to have a lesbian organization fund LGBTI causes, because this way the world’s greatest lesbian problem — invisibility — is inherently countered. And I appreciate the fact Astraea is a public charity — private foundations often are too donor-driven, they act too fast. Astraea is dependent on many donors, they have to listen to many sources of input and set their agenda in a responsible and long-term fashion.” Ise Bosch, German philanthropist, initiator of the International Fund of the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for JusticeQuestions to ask when choosing an intermediary:n How much control over grantmaking decisions do I want/need?n How much am I willing to pay for an intermediary’s services?n How much information do I need to feel comfortable about the funding decision?n Do I want direct contact with the grantees? Can I get it through this intermediary?n Do I have the expertise and knowledge to make grantmaking decisions myself or in collaboration with staff and advisors?n Do I have the legal protections I need through this arrangement?n Do I like working with and feel comfortable with the staff and leadership of the intermediary?Fees and ContractsAny significant relationship with an intermediary requires a thorough grant agreement that clarifies the purpose and restrictions of the gift, as desired. With most intermediaries, the terms of the gift are negotiable — and range widely. There are usually fees applied to such gifts, which can range from a simple administrative fee of 1 percent to 15 percent to cover the actual costs of making grants, to a more significant fee if the intermediary is building or enhancing a grantmaking program. Most often, the fees associated with these arrangements are less than the cost of doing such a program within a foundation. Disadvantages of Using an IntermediaryThe obvious downside to working with an intermediary is that one gives up control of philanthropic resources. Even with a solid agreement in place, the control over the funds legally belongs to the intermediary organization. The intermediary also controls the relationship with the grantees. Some intermediaries may be capable of providing the donor with sufficient opportunities to relate directly with the grantees. But for a donor who wishes to engage with the grantee and develop a close working and learning relationship, an intermediary may not be the best funding mechanism for those purposes. “Public foundations and NGOs that have a regranting function are critical actors in the grantmaking process for LGBTI communities around the world … These types of funders were responsible for a sizable percentage of grants that were distributed to LGBTI communities around the world, often because they have the capacity to allocate smaller grants as well as a thorough, nuanced knowledge of local politics. Funders without the mechanics or the knowledge to fund effectively are well-advised to rely on intermediaries.”A Global Gaze, Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues83. Making cross-border grants directly or through a private foundationSome donors do not wish to relinquish their decision-making power to others and have the time, resources, and passion to create their own international LGBT grantmaking program. Some may wish to create a long-lasting legacy or a family tradition through a private foundation or similar philanthropic structure. There are a few different ways that individuals can make grants directly to organizations located in other countries. Although the legal and administrative requirements are more onerous when functioning as a stand-alone entity, it is possible — with the right resources and advisers — for private foundations and private individuals to support the international LGBT rights movement with direct grantmaking. Choosing a direct overseas grantmaking mechanism allows the donor to have total control over their program — and to experience the corresponding satisfaction. There are a few different ways that individuals can make grants directly to organizations located in other countries. Write a Check or Wire MoneyIndividuals may simply write a check or wire money to a group. But for a U.S.-based individual, it is important to know these gifts are not tax-deductible. Furthermore, individuals are responsible for complying with the same U.S. legal restrictions that institutional funders face. These requirements are described below. Use an Intermediary Funder for Single GiftsOne relatively simple solution for an individual wishing to make a small number of overseas contributions is to pay a fee to organizations such as Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice or Charitable America Foundation (both listed in the second part of this guide) to make single gifts. The New Israel Fund will also facilitate single gifts to LGBT organizations in Israel. Create a Private Foundation For a donor wishing to maintain a substantial level of control, make a larger number of grants, and receive tax benefits from these charitable gifts, a private foundation or other charitable planned giving instrument may be appropriate. However, certain restrictive federal tax law provisions apply to private foundations in the United States 9Blue Diamond Society (Katmandu, Nepal)Year Formed: 2001Paid Staff: 35Annual Budget: HIV $250,000; Human Rights $300,000; Constitutional Campaign $200,000Funders (past and present): Hivos, Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Sigrid Rausing Trust, CCOs, Sidaction, Elton John AIDS Foundation, Family Health International, Population Services International, Global Fund for Women, Mama Cash, and Urgent Action Fund. Blue Diamond Society is Nepal’s largest LGBT rights organization. Last year, the organization achieved its greatest success to date, with the Nepali Supreme Court issuing a directive to the government to end discrimination on the basisof sexual orientation and gender identity. Blue Diamond went further with a study of same-sex marriage rights in other countries and will soon make a recommendation to the Nepalese government. Blue Diamond Society’s director, Sunil Pant, was recently elected as the first openly LGBT person to the Constituent Assembly, which will draft the country’s next constitution.GRANTEE PROFILEphilanthropic goals. It may even be possible to set up a foundation in another country with fewer restrictions than in the United States. It is very important to seek the consultation of an experienced philanthropic adviser to help choose a philanthropic vehicle that best fits one’s tax, legal, and financial situation. Such support may be obtained through an attorney, tax planner, trust officer at a bank, philanthropic consultant, or a community foundation — or a combination of them. U.S. Legal Considerations and ComplexitiesFor U.S.-based donors — both individual and institutional — it is crucial to have legal counsel experienced with the U.S. Patriot Act and Executive Order 13224, which are the laws implemented after the tragedy of Sept. 11, and which create significant restrictions on international grantmaking. Even before September 2001, it was not legal to make grants to groups listed on the U.S. Treasury’s List of Embargoed Nations, such as Burma, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and Sudan. Additionally, there are now lists of organizations in other countries maintained by various federal government departments to whom gifts are prohibited, such as the U.S. Department of State’s Terrorist Exclusion list and the Specially Designated Nationals list of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence created Anti-Terrorist Financing Guidelines: Voluntary Best Practices for U.S.-Based Charities, with recommended practices for international grantmaking intended to help donors comply with these federal regulations. Donors need to make both procedural and policy decisions about how to comply with these requirements. 4. Opening a donor-advised fund that allows for cross-border givingDonor-advised fund programs exist in connection with many financial institutions, with large nonprofit organizations, and with community foundations of all types. A donor-advised fund is created by making a gift to such an institution, receiving a full tax deduction, and then retaining the right to advise the institution about the grants made from that fund. Donor-advised funds are often popular because they are usually able to receive a full charitable deduction for the gift into the fund and may receive additional favorable tax treatment of appreciated assets. There has been a huge that do not apply to other types of tax-exempt charitable organizations (which are referred to as “public charities”) and often make operating a private foundation more complex. For example, a private foundation generally must make annual “qualifying distributions,” which generally take the form of grants to charitable organizations, in an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the value of the foundation’s assets.  International grants must be made in a specific prescribed manner to avoid penalty excise taxes and may count toward the minimum payout rules, as long as proper due diligence and documentation for the international grants occur. These types of grants must be made in accordance with IRS procedures for making an “equivalency determination” or exercising “expenditure responsibility.” The goal of an equivalency determination is to establish that the grantee is the equivalent of a public charity in the United States. The purpose of exercising expenditure responsibility is to ensure that reasonable efforts have been exerted to see that funds will be spent by the grantee on activities that further a charitable purpose. Both of these processes may involve a significant amount of administration and ongoing reporting both by the grantee to the private foundation, as well as by the private foundation to the IRS.5When considering creating a private foundation for foreign grantmaking, there are many factors to weigh. The Council on Foundations does not have a recommended monetary threshold for forming a private foundation, but most philanthropic advisers suggest a minimum of US $5–10 million in assets to justify the setup and ongoing administrative expenses. Since the administrative and legal expenses of international grantmaking are even larger than for U.S.-based grants, a careful review of the real costs is recommended in making such a decision.6 Other Charitable Planned-Giving VehiclesThere are other philanthropic structures that can be established for individual giving — such as a supporting organization, a private operating foundation, a charitable remainder trust, charitable lead trust, or other planned gifts — that may accomplish one’s 105) For further information, see Equivalency Determination or Expenditure Responsibility: A Guide in Plain English, by Betsy Adler and Stephanie Petit for United States International Grantmaking, a resource of the Council on Foundations.

They continue to be the fastest-growing philanthropic vehicle because they are simple for the donor to open and administer, as well as being extremely flexible and inexpensive for the donor to operate. Donor-advised funds differ in terms of the investment options, fees, minimum grant size, minimum fund size, ease and level of service, and amount of philanthropic advice or donor services available. The fund may have the donor’s name in it, or the donor may wish to remain anonymous. While the legal authority over the fund is in the hands of the institution and governed by their board of directors, the donor’s funds are accounted for separately. It is rare that a donor’s grant recommendation is refused by the organization. In exchange for legal control, the donor does not have any administrative or legal issues to handle, such as accounting, tax preparation, or legal compliances. Instead, the donor can focus entirely on choosing the groups and grants she/he wants to support.Over the past few years, the United States Congress has shown an increased interest in regulating donor-advised funds, as demonstrated by the enactment of certain provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.7 The Act amended the Internal Revenue Code to add, for the first time, a definition of the term “donor-advised fund” and to add rules that govern contributions to and distributions from donor-advised funds. Under the Act, donor-advised funds are now subject to the excess business holdings rules, which previously applied only to private foundations, and the Treasury Department has been directed to conduct a study and consider whether donor-advised funds also should be subject to the annual payout requirements applicable to private foundations. At the moment, the law does not impose a minimum annual payout on donor-advised funds, but some organizations that sponsor donor-advised funds have imposed their own payout requirements. One important change that the Act made regarding international grantmaking from donor-advised funds is that cross-border grants from donor-advised funds now require the same documentation procedures as cross-border grants by private foundations (determination of expenditure responsibility or equivalency, as explained above).117) Pension Protection Act of 2006 can be found in full on the Web site of the Department of Labor (www.dol.gov) or the Internal Revenue Service (www.irs.gov).Coalition of African Lesbians (Windhoek, Namibia)Year Formed: 2003Paid Staff: 2Funders: Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Hivos, the Sigrid Rausing Trust, and the Heinrich Böell Foundation. Coalition of African Lesbians (CAL) is a network of 19 member organizations from 11 African countries. The coalition advocates equality for lesbians throughout Africa by lobbying the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights, campaigning to decriminalize homosexuality, offering leadership training for activists, and conducting research. CAL recently collaborated with ARC-International to organize the International Dialogue on Gender, Sexuality, and HIV/AIDS in South Africa. This is one of very few LGBT organizations with a regional scope that is beginning to effectively harness the power of regional collaboration for both training and advocacy. GRANTEE PROFILE5. Joining or creating a donor circle, study trip, affinity group, or other collaborative giving vehicle Finding ways to connect to other donors — for individuals and institutions — can provide a powerful opportunity to learn, share, and clarify one’s grantmaking vision. There are two new regional collaborative funding mechanisms for institutional donors that are in formation — one for Latin America and the Caribbean, and one for East Africa (contact information is in the second part of this report). Funders collaborating to support LGBT rights issues outside of the United States is very new, but it is likely to grow to include mechanisms for smaller donors, as well as encompassing other regions and strategies. Similarly, there is a new trend of “diaspora donor groups” developing in conjunction with various community foundations, which spur the support of organizations in their home countries or regions. The Jewish community has a long-standing tradition of collectively supporting Jewish organizations in Israel and in Eastern Europe through Jewish Community Federations across the United States. In recent years, some of the Jewish Community Federations have begun to support LGBT groups in Israel. In LGBT diaspora communities, such support occurs more infrequently but is likely to become more formalized in the future, as immigrant LGBT groups seek to organize their financial support for LGBT movements in their countries of origin. The first such diaspora donor fund recently opened at the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice: The Nutongzhi Fund has collected funds from Chinese LGBT people in the United States, and has distributed grants to Chinese-speaking LGBT organizations in Asia. Similarly, the Central American Women’s Foundation, which funds some lesbian groups in Central America, is beginning to raise money directly in North America among Latinas for this work. This trend of formalizing the financial connection between immigrants in the diaspora and their home countries will likely continue to grow within the LGBT movement. 12All donor-advised funds can make grants to U.S.-based international nonprofit organizations, but relatively few donor-advised fund programs allow a donor to request that a grant be made to an organization located outside of the United States. Even the largest donor-advised fund programs — representing billions of philanthropic dollars and connected to major financial institutions such as the Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving, Vanguard Charitable Endowment Fund, and Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund — do not allow direct cross-border grants to be made.There are, however, a variety of donor-advised funding programs that can facilitate international grantmaking, such as Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, Tides Foundation, Charities Aid Foundation, Give2Asia, and the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice. These organizations are described in the second section of this report. Establishing a fund at such an institution could serve an individual wishing to support LGBT groups in the Global South and East. They each have staff with expertise in global grantmaking and human rights issues.  “In 1997, I met three women activists from Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia and was amazed by their work. In 1999, when the Serbian aggression escalated, I was on the phone with one of them who asked me to let people know that they were being carted off in boxcars and she feared she would be gone the next day. My e-mail to friends — which was not a fund-raising letter — went around the world, touched women emotionally, and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. I set up a fund at the Agape Foundation and began making grants to women, peace, and LGBTI organizations. To date, we’ve given approximately $300,000 to LGBTI groups in the Balkans.”Marta Drury, donor and founder of the Heart and Hand Fund of Agape FoundationFor an individual donor, opportunities exist to join a donor circle or to take a study trip. For example, the American Jewish World Service and the Global Fund for Women periodically offer donors the opportunity to travel as a group to a region or country, accompanied by staff, to meet local organizations, attend conferences, and learn about the issues and groups in those parts of the world. Such partnerships between foundation staff, grantees, and donors can be powerful and inspiring events for all involved. While none currently exists, a donor circle to collaboratively study and fund international LGBT rights issues could be a useful addition to the variety of mechanisms available to donors interested in funding this sector. Many of the entities in the second section of this report are capable of housing a donor circle or initiating study trips for groups of donors. “Our ‘Donor and Activism’ retreat that Astraea holds every two years has given space and support to activists from around the world to meet and connect with donor-activists from the U.S. We bring together our advisers, grants panelists, donors, and grantees for a content-rich weekend of sharing and learning together.”Katherine Acey, Executive Director of Astraea Lesbian Foundation for JusticeLastly, there are a number of donor affinity groups —or groups of funders who come together around a particular grantmaking interest — that may provide opportunities for networking and learning, depending on the donor’s interest areas. Relevantly themed groups might include Africa Grantmakers Group; Funders Concerned About AIDS; Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues; Funders Network on Population, Reproductive Health and Rights; Gill Foundation’s OutGiving; Global Grantmakers Forum; Grantmakers Without Borders; Hispanics in Philanthropy; the International Human Rights Funders Group; and others. 13Colombia Diversa (Bogota, Colombia)Year Formed: 2004Paid Staff: 7Annual Budget: $257,000Funders: Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Diakonia (Swiss), Norwegian Fund for Human Rights, Canadian International Development Agency, American Airlines, UBS, Absolut, Levi’s, and a variety of Colombian municipal, national, and private funders. Established in 2004, Colombia Diversa is a national LGBT organization that recently won an important legal victory for same-sex survivors’ pensions. Colombia Diversa subsequently filed a judicial appeal challenging the constitutionality of a number of laws related to the unequal treatment of same-sex partners.GRANTEE PROFILEFiguring out the best way to support international LGBT rights issues and groups starts with understanding the wish to give in the first place and determining what level of engagement is desired. Hiring the services of a philanthropic consultant may be a useful way to get the advice and information you need to begin, refine, or even improve an international LGBT giving portfolio. Working with and learning from other philanthropists is also a great way to figure out what makes the most sense for you or your institution. “Because there is so much to be done and so few people doing work in the field of international LGBT rights, entry into the field is easier than it seems. When dealing with basic issues like people getting beaten, killed, and raped, the advocacy choices are pretty obvious. After forming a relationship and listening to a few trusted advisers and activists, the opportunities that make sense for a particular donor will become apparent very quickly. Not only is international LGBT rights an area where the need is desperate, but also the opportunities for accomplishment and satisfaction are immediate.This is an area where a donor can directly witness the impact of a gift.”Andrew Park, Senior Philanthropic Advisor, Wellspring AdvisorsThese groups usually offer an annual conference or meeting, an e-mail list, a Web site, and other ways of communicating information about their funding areas. Conferences are usually attended by staff members of large and small institutional funders and can be very informative gatherings. Sometimes ideas for formal funding collaboratives evolve from such meetings, where institutional donors pool money for a particular funding initiative. Often such collaborative funds end up being housed by funding intermediaries.

Doing international grantmaking to groups that are advancing LGBT rights fulfills our goal of putting the margins right bang at the center. Our money and solidarity can be an effective tool to support courageous activists to transform oppression and discrimination, and in turn, transform entire societies.”Nicky McIntyre, Executive Director of Mama Cash The international LGBT rights grantees highlighted in this report are intended to give a glimpse of the breadth of organizations located in the Global South and East working to defend against human rights violations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and proactively creating a more just world. The funding examples in Giving Out Globally show how even modestly sized grants can have enormous impact in a relatively short period of time. You can help make this happen. 15CreditsWritten by Julie DorfResearch support by Lindasusan UlrichEdited by Sue SimonDesign support by The Brakeman GroupAdditional thanks to Katherine Acey, Mai Kiang, Nicky McIntyre, Shalini Nataraj, Jenni Olson, Andrew Park, and Esther Vonk.16ResourcesFunding IntermediariesAgape Foundation/Heart and Hand FundWeb site: http://kerrylobel.typepad.com/heart_and_hand_fund/Based in What Country: United StatesContact Person: Marta DruryE-mail: deadcow@igc.orgAddress: P.O.
