Firstly, this \nreport would not have been possible if it were not for beyondblue recognising the need for this \nresearch and providing the funding to undertake it. We are greatly indebted to the members of \nthe Community Advisory Group (CAG): Sally Goldner (Transgender Victoria), Zoe Birkinshaw (Zoe \nBelle Gender Centre), Canon O’Saurus and Sim Kennedy (Ygender), and Dani Wright Toussaint \n(The Freedom Centre). They were instrumental in making this research as useful, appropriate, \nand respectful as possible. Gina Wilson, then President of Organisation Intersex International \n(OII) in Australia, provided guidance in relation to the inclusion of intersex young people at the \nbeginning of the project. Also, thank you to the current President of OII, Morgan Carpenter, for \nhis feedback on the final report. Many organisations and individuals helped to spread the word \nabout the survey. We were humbled and excited by the number of times the survey link was \nshared and promoted online through social media sites such as Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook, as \nwell as through online news outlets.\nA special thank you to the following groups and organisations: Transgender Victoria, Ygender, \nZoe Belle Gender Centre, The Freedom Centre, Trans Health Australia, Australian Aboriginal \nand Torres Strait Islander GLBT Community, Out in Perth, Darwin LGBT, UNSW Queer Collective, \nGenderqueer Australia, Open Doors Youth Service Inc., Gender Centre, FTM Australia, LGBTQ \nDown Under, LOTL online magazine, Australian Clearing House for Youth Studies, Safe Schools \nCoalition Victoria, GLHV, Western Rainbow Families, WayOut Victoria, Gippsland Rainbow \nCollective, MSA Queer, Headspace Darwin, Diversity Project Greater Shepparton, GOWEST, \nSisters and Brothers NT, YGLAM Performing Arts Program, PFLAG Sydney, Equal Marriage Rights \nAustralia, and Western Rainbow Families. While we have tried to mention all who helped to \npromote the survey, other organisations have undoubtedly been involved, and we also extend \nour thanks to them. We would also like to thank Sally Goldner and Out of the Pan at 3CR \nCommunity Radio for devoting a show segment to the opening of the survey and the importance \nof participation, and Nastasia Campanella from Triple J news for her promotional work. \nWe would like to thank Robyn Crawford from Robyn Red Breast Designs who, through her \nvolunteer work at Ygender, supplied us with the image of the kite seen throughout this report. \nAlso thank you to Micah Scott for the design and graphical work on this report and to Marco \nFink, Liam Wright and the many young people from Minus18 for conducting the photoshoots \nand modelling for the beautiful images in this report.  \nFinally, and most importantly, we acknowledge the young people who shared with us such \nintimate parts of their lives. We understand that the survey asked some very difficult questions \nand we hope to have not only done justice to their words, but to have contributed to much- \nneeded change. There was courage and joy in the young people’s responses, and collectively \nthey have helped to tell a story about the kinds of structural discrimination and societal attitudes \nthat need such change. They shared the challenges of looking after themselves and showed us \nthe importance of supportive friends, family, teachers and communities, as well as the positive \nrole of activism in their lives.\n6We would like to acknowledge that language in the \ngender diverse and transgender communities is \nconstantly changing.  All terms mean something unique \nand specific to the person using them. There are also a \nlarge number of culturally distinct terms that are used \nwhich we have not listed but which should be respected \nand recognised.  The following terms are not exhaustive \nof the many terms and definitions used by, and about, \ngender diverse, transgender, and intersex people. We \nhave chosen the terms that are most pertinent to this \nreport and are defined in such a way as to signal our use \nof them in the following pages.\nAsexual\nAsexuality is an absence of sexual attraction to anyone \nor anything, although this does not preclude romantic \nattraction. Approximately 1% of the population identifies \nas asexual (Bogaert, 2004).\nBinary \nA term that describes when two things oppose each \nother. For example man/woman or heterosexual/\nhomosexual. The use of binaries often forecloses other \nways of thinking about such categories.\nCisgender \nA term used to describe when a person’s gender identity \nmatches social expectations given their sex assigned at \nbirth.\nErasure \nDescribes an experience whereby transgender and \ngender diverse people’s preferred gender is ignored or \nerased in interpersonal and/or institutional contexts. For \nexample through constant misgendering or inappropriate \nhealth care.\nGender diversity \nGender diversity includes people who identify as agender \n(having no gender), as bigender (both a woman and a \nman) or as non-binary (neither woman nor man). Some \nnon-binary people identify as genderqueer or as having \nshifting or fluid genders. Gender diversity also refers to \nindividuals whose gender expressions differ from what \nis socially expected and so a gender diverse person may \nbe assigned female and identify as a woman but present \ntheir gender in ways that subvert normative notions of \nfemininity. (www.lgbtihealth.org.au)\nHeteronormative \nRelates to the systemic privileging of the social models \nof binary sex, binary gender and binary sexuality that \nnormalise heterosexuality.\nHomophobia \nRefers to the discrimination, marginalisation, abuse, \nand harassment experienced by people in the LGBTIQ \ncommunities. Intersex people also experience \nhomophobia.  \n(http://oii.org.au/21336/intersex-for-allies/)\nIntersex \nIntersex is a term that relates to a range of physical traits \nor variations that lie between ideals of male and female. \nIntersex people are born with physical, hormonal or \ngenetic features that are neither wholly female nor wholly \nmale; or a combination of female and male; or neither \nfemale nor male.\nMany forms of intersex exist; it is a spectrum or umbrella \nGlossary\n7term, rather than a single category. Intersex differences \nmay be apparent at birth. Some common intersex \nvariations are diagnosed prenatally. Some intersex traits \nbecome apparent at puberty, or when trying to conceive, \nor through random chance. \n(http://oii.org.au/21336/intersex-for-allies/)\nMisgendering \nMisgendering is a term for describing or addressing \nsomeone using language that does not match how \nthat person identifies their own gender or body. Using \ninclusive language means not misgendering people. \n(www.lgbtihealth.org.au)\nPansexual \nRefers to sexual or romantic attraction that is not based \non a person’s gender identity or sex.\nPolyamory \nIs a term used to describe the practice of honest, open, \nethical multiple relationships. For example multiple \nrelationships where all parties are aware of and agree \nwith the situation. (www.polyvic.org.au)\nQueer \nA sexual or gender identity that is non-conforming to \nheterosexual or gender binaries. Is also an historically \nlocated political term used to resist homophobia. Further, \nthis term also refers to academic theory and method that \nresists normative ways of exploring and understanding \nsocial phenomena (i.e. queer theory).\nTransgender \nAn umbrella term including transsexual and transgender, \nused to describe a broad range of non-conforming \ngender identities and/or expressions. Usually includes all \ntransgender people, but some transsexual people and \nmembers of the gender diverse community prefer not to \nuse this term.\nTranssexual\nA person who identifies as the sex ‘opposite’ to the one \nassigned at birth and who may choose to undergo sex \naffirmation/reassignment surgery.\nTrans*\nThe * is used to denote the umbrella nature of this \nterm however it is important to note that for some \norganisations this is redundant given that trans (and \ntransgender) is already an umbrella term.  \n(www.freedom.org.au)\nSistergirls and Brotherboys\nSome Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples use \nthe term Sistergirl (sometimes Yimpininni in the Tiwi \nIslands) to describe male-assigned people who live partly \nor fully as women and Brotherboy to describe female-\nassigned people who live partly or fully as men. In some \nregions, Sistergirls have unique societal roles. \n(www.lgbtihealth.org.au)\nTransphobia \nRefers to the discrimination, marginalisation, harassment, \nand abuse experienced by or perpetrated against, \ntransgender and gender diverse people.\n8Contents\nAcknowledgements 5\nGlossary 6\nExecutive Summary 11\nChapter 1: Introduction 15\nCulture and Media 15\nLaw and Policy  15\nTheory and Terms 16\nResearch 17\nChapter 2: Research design 21\nCommunity Advisory Group 21\nPartnership with GLHV 21\nRecruitment 22\nSurvey 22\nInterviews 23\nAnalysis 24\nEthical considerations and approval 24\nLimitations of this research 24\nChapter 3: Demographics 27\nBackground and location 28\nMain occupation and schooling 29\nSex Assigned at Birth 30\nRelationship Status  30\nChapter 4: Gender  33\nGender in Relation to Sex Assigned at Birth 34\nGender Identity and Age 35\nPronouns 36\nChapter 5: Transition 39\nDefinitions of Transition 39\nChapter 6: Sexuality 45\nAsexuality 46\nRomantic and/or sexual attraction 47\nChapter 7: School 49\nLegal Rights at School 49\nTeachers, Leadership and School Culture 53\nSupportive Classmates 56\nInclusive Environments 56\nChapter 8: Abuse and Harassment 59\nVerbal Abuse 59\n9Physical Abuse 60\nImpacts of Abuse 62\nAddressing Abuse 62\nChapter 9: Mental health 65\nStress 66\nAnxiety and depression 66\nGender Dysphoria and Gender Identity Disorder 66\nSubstance use 67\nChapter 1O: Mental health professionals 71\nSatisfaction and engagement with  \nmental health professionals 71\nIdeal Interactions 71\nEducating the Professional 72\nAvoiding mental health professionals 73\nNegative Experiences 74\nChapter 11: Protective factors, activism,  \nand knowledge 77\nFeeling Better 77\nParents and Families 81\nActivism 82\nInformation sources 84\nChapter 12: Conclusions and recommendations 88\nState and federal governments 88\nMental health professionals and services 88\nSupport services 89\nCommunity health organisations and local councils  89\nSchools and education professionals 89\nFurther research 90\nGeneral 90\nReferences 92\n10\n11\nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction\nThis report, From Blues to Rainbows: The mental health and well-being of gender diverse and transgender \nyoung people in Australia, is the culmination of many months of engagement with gender diverse and \ntransgender young people across Australia. Historically, transgender and gender diverse people face social and \nlegal barriers that restrict their freedoms and dignity. United Nations international human rights principles and \nnew Australian national legislation now provide protection for people on the basis of sexual orientation, gender \nidentity and intersex status. Much past research on gender diverse and transgender young people has privileged \npsycho-medical frames or focussed on victimisation. Conversely, in this report we privilege self-definition and \nactively look for alternative, positive stories. \nResearch design\nThis study aimed to redress the absence of positive, resilience-focussed research for gender diverse, and \ntransgender young people. It relied heavily on community consultation and inter-organisational collaboration to \naccess participants in a sensitive and appropriate manner. The study combined an online survey and interviews.\nDemographics\nOne hundred and eighty-nine young people participated in the online survey, and sixteen of the same young \npeople attended real-time online interviews. They were aged between 14 and 25 years with an average age of \n19. Overall, 55% were either studying, or studying and working, and 16.5% were unemployed. \nIntersex young people\nWhile this research attempted to explore the mental health risks and protections of intersex young people \nit failed to ask appropriate questions while inadvertently conflating issues pertinent to gender diverse and \ntransgender young people with intersex status. Therefore, this research does not report on data related to the \nfew intersex young people who completed the survey.\nGender \nOver one in three young people identified with genders that do not conform to the binary notion of gender \n(man/woman). Half of the young people identified with genders under the ‘transgender’ umbrella and 11% \nwere gender questioning. Almost a third of the participants “always knew” about their gender identity. Many of \nthe young people understood their gender identities in personal and self-reflective ways.\nTransition\nThe young people described the term ‘transition’ in diverse and individual ways. In the survey, we located \nsocial transition as related to social presentation (clothes, name, pronouns and documents) and social roles/ \ntreatment; 77% of participants had already, or were currently, socially transitioning and a further 7% aspired \nto do so. We defined medical transition as relating to medical changes through hormonal treatments and \nsurgeries, for example. Those who identified under the ‘transgender’ umbrella were more likely to want to \nmedically transition than those who identified as gender diverse.\n12\nSexuality\nSixty-one per cent of the young people identified with sexuality identities that were not defined by gender \nidentities. Participants were most likely to identify as queer (27%) followed by pansexual (23%). They were \nleast likely to identify with the terms which relied on concepts of sex and gender: homosexual (2%), gay (5%) or \nheterosexual (5%).\nSchool\nGender diverse and transgender students attended all types of Australian schools. They were more likely \nto attend alternative schools than the general population. Participants who did not feel supported by their \nteachers were over four times more likely to leave school if they experienced discrimination than those with \nteacher support. Inclusive schools were those where leadership and teachers tried to address students with \ntheir preferred pronouns, were flexible about uniform and toilet arrangements, took a stand against bullying, \nand aimed to be accommodating to the individual’s needs. Improvements to sexuality and puberty education, \nwhich are inclusive of these students, are needed.\nAbuse, harassment, and discrimination\nAlmost two thirds of the young people had experienced verbal abuse in response to their gender presentation \nor non-conformity, and one fifth had experienced physical abuse. This abuse occurred in all types of places, but \nespecially at school and in public sites such as the street and on public transport. Over 90% of young people \nwho experienced physical abuse had thought about suicide in response to their experience.\nMental health\nAlmost half of the young people had been diagnosed with depression by a health professional; 38% had had \nthoughts about suicide; and one in four had spoken to a health professional about this. Participants who had \nexperienced verbal or physical abuse were more likely to have an eating disorder, suffer from post-traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD), and have depression. They were also more likely to think about suicide.\nMental health professionals\nOverall, 66% of the young people had seen a health professional for their mental health in the last twelve \nmonths; of these, over 60% were satisfied with their experiences. The young people valued health professionals \nwho were knowledgeable in gender diversity and transgender health care, although the need to educate their \nprofessionals about their own conditions was common. Over half of the participants had experienced at least \none negative experience with a health care professional, and one quarter of the participants avoided medical \nservices due to their gender presentation.\nProtective factors, activism, and knowledge\nOne in three participants did not feel supported by their family. Those with supportive parents fared better \non a range of indicators, including their mental health and access to mental health professionals. Regardless \nof parental support, the study found that the young people engaged in a range of other activities to help \nthemselves feel better, which was very encouraging. This included listening to music (90%) and talking to friends \nand peers (77%). Support services and organisations were valuable for the young people who accessed a wide \nrange. Further, 62% became involved in activism to feel better.\n13\nConclusions and recommendations\nThe findings from this research strongly suggest that both broad-level and targeted changes need to be \nimplemented in order to support young gender diverse and transgender people to increase their mental and \ngeneral wellbeing. Broad-level changes recommended include Federal and State governments unifying their \npolicies and legislation affecting gender diverse and transgender young people (i.e. Birth Certificate legislation) \nto foster consistency of rights across Australia. The planning for these recommendations should, where \nappropriate, include renumerated consultation with gender diverse and transgender community members. Key \nrecommendations from this research are outlined below, while more detailed recommendations are available at \nthe end of this report:\nSupport services\n ↗ Be well funded in order to provide easily accessible education and peer-led support on multiple \nplatforms, including face-to-face and online.\n ↗ Provide education and peer-led support for parents of gender diverse and transgender young \npeople. \nCommunity health organisations and local councils \n ↗ Include gender diversity into new and existing violence against women and other initiatives \n(i.e. gender equity) that aim to redress rigid gender stereotypes, and contribute to community \nresilience and engagement by playing a part in information sharing about local support services \nand appropriate referrals. \nSchools and education professionals\n ↗ Train teachers and school leadership, through adequately funded programs, in appropriate and \nsupportive behaviour and language towards gender diverse and transgender young people. \nSchools to sensitively respond to students’ need for toilets that are appropriate, private, and safe.   \n ↗ Develop and promote uniform policies that recognise the needs of transgender and gender diverse \nyoung people to appropriately express their gender identity(ies). \n ↗ Support gender diverse and transgender young people by providing access to wellbeing personnel \nwhile also recognising that in some cases school chaplains may not be readily trusted by gender \ndiverse and transgender young people.  \nMental health professionals and services\n ↗ Train pre-service and in-service mental health professionals in gender diversity and transgender \nhealth care, including appropriate use of language and behaviour.\n ↗ Make appropriate referrals to specialist services for gender diverse and transgender mental health \ncare when issues beyond their expertise arise. \nFurther research\n ↗ Intersex status is a matter of biology rather than gender identity. While often conflated with \nnotions of sexual and gender identities, people who are intersex face a distinct set of social \nand medical inequalities. Research that is focused on gender identity alone cannot adequately \n14\naddress the unique human rights issues (for example, childhood genital surgery), discrimination, \nmarginalisation, homophobia, and transphobia that intersex people face. As such, intersex-specific \nresearch is needed to examine the mental health risks and protective factors that are relevant for \nthem.\n15\nChapter 1: Introduction\nThis report is the culmination of many months of engagement across Australia with young people aged between \n14 and 25 who have shared their thoughts, understandings, experiences, hopes and dreams with us through an \nonline survey and online interviews. Their narratives are insightful, touching, and hopeful. Young voices have \ntold us how they care for themselves as well as shining a light on how health services, schools, government and \npolicy makers can better serve their needs. This research was designed to expand on findings from previous \nAustralian research with young people (Hillier et al., 2010) that found that gender-questioning and transgender \nyoung people not only experienced higher rates of self-harm and suicidal thoughts, but were also more likely \nto be involved in activism than their cisgender and same-sex attracted peers. This later finding is a potentially \npositive one and points to the need for research to not only explore the mental health needs of these young \npeople but also the ways in which they advocate and care for themselves in the face of discrimination and \nabuse. \nCulture and Media\nGender diverse and transgender young people have historically lacked a visible presence in Australian culture \nand media. Part of the problem has been the lack of acceptance of diversity in Australia’s modern social history. \nWhere they have been visible in mainstream, popular, fictional, and current affairs media, gender diverse and \ntransgender people have mostly been portrayed in ways that perpetuate stereotypes, reinforce the binary \nnarrative, and silence gender identities that sit outside the concept of the gender binary. There have also been \nattacks on the very concept of ‘transgender’ from an extremely radical feminist angle by one or two powerfully \nvocal individuals (from a position not widely held by contemporary feminists), who see gender affirmation \nprocesses as ‘abuse’ (Karvelas, 2013). \nThe last few years have been a significant turning point for transgender and gender diverse visibility in Australia \non television and in the media (reflected in documentaries on ABC2 through to the inclusion of the stories of \ncontestants on mainstream shows such as The X Factor). News and current affairs programs and newspapers \nhave featured stories on the struggles and triumphs of transgender children at school and in court as they \npursue gender affirmation processes (Fewster, 2013; Kissane, 2009; McCredie, 2008). An article published \naround the time of writing is an example of some of the positive coverage about transgender and gender \ndiverse people that is beginning to be seen in the media. Drawing on the story of Victorian high school student, \nMia, this article on the front page of The Age newspaper depicted a smiling young transwoman wearing a \nschool dress to school for the first time (Nicholson, 2014). The affirmation of her gender identity in such a \nvisible and positive manner is indicative of the changes that are starting to be seen in mainstream media.\nThere has also been an increase in the number of non-government and advocacy-based community \norganisations which have contributed to visibility for all these groups as well as providing advocacy online \n(through websites, blogs and statements), in parliamentary hearings, and in the press. The rapid growth \nof social media has also given more space for expressions of positive non-binary identities, characters and \ndiscussions. \nLaw and Policy \nIn June 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted resolution 17/19—the first United Nations \n16\nresolution on human rights, sexual orientation, gender identity, and intersex issues. The United Nations put \npressure on Australia and other countries to support greater recognition of discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression in direct legislative provisions (UN Human Rights \nCouncil, 2011; United Nations, 2012; United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2011). During \nthis period, there were also heated debates over whether transgender identity issues really should be seen \nas a psychological disease or disorder, as they have been treated historically within earlier versions of the \nDiagnostical Statistics Manual (DSM) used to diagnose and treat psychological conditions. Drescher (2002) \nrecounted how in the DSM-5 the diagnoses commonly used for transgender patients seeking gender affirmation \nprocesses was changed from Gender Identity Disorder to Gender Dysphoria, and, to reduce stigma, it was no \nlonger bundled with the Paraphilias and Sexual Dysfunction section. \nThese international rights events have reinforced progress towards recognition of transgender and gender \ndiverse rights in Australia, providing support to the sustained long-term efforts of local advocacy groups \nand their allies. Governments around Australia are now seeking to address disparities in state and territory \nlaws concerning transgender and intersex rights, a process bolstered by the Australian Government’s newly \nreleased Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender (Australian Government, 2013), while changes to \nalign Medicare policies have also been announced (Plibersek & McLucas, 2013).  Further to this, in June 2013 \nthe Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013 (Cth) \n(SDA Amendment Act) inserted new grounds into the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) (SDA), particularly \nprotections against discrimination for all Australians on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation and/or \nintersex status. The Act provides protection from discrimination for people who identify as men, women, and \nneither male nor female. This includes the protection of transgender, gender diverse, and intersex students \nin schools (although there are exemptions on the protections for transgender students in religious schools) \nregardless of the sex the person was assigned at birth, or whether the person has undergone any medical \nintervention. Further to this, in March, 2014 the Australian Capital Territory Government passed an amendment \nto the Birth Certificates Law allowing individuals to change the sex listed on their birth certificate, as well as \nadding a third category ‘x’. \nTheory and Terms\nHistorically there has been a variety of theoretical frames for ‘transgender’ young people in research. These \nframes have included those of biological science, chemistry, sociology, feminism(s), medical science (the limits \nand possibilities of medical treatment), queer theory, and psychology. Given the contrasting theories around \nbrain chemistries and cultural context, and given that young people may themselves see their identities in \nqueer, psychiatric, medical, biological or other terms (in their self-definition), we decided to keep this project \nperson-centred, allowing the work to privilege young people’s lived experiences. We took a post-modern \nrelativist view of ‘transgender’ and ‘gender diverse’ as discursively contested/constructed umbrella terms, \nassociated with a range of debated identities. We accepted that the terms ‘transgender’ and ‘gender diverse’ \nhave multiple meanings to multiple people who experience or research it according to their particular \nframework/s of reference, and therefore privilege the knowledge about young people aligned with it (Jones, \n2013). We used this broad frame so as not to limit the data, or exclude people with experiences at variance \nwith  a more ‘stable’ version of these terms. We reject essentialist views of gender that deny transgender or \ngender diverse identities at all, or cast them as ‘sinful’ or ‘aberrant’, and extremist radical feminist notions of \ntransgender people as ‘victims of patriarchy’—we instead accept that it is possible for transgender and gender \ndiverse people to have empowered and positive experiences of their identities.\nWe particularly privilege those definitions of transgender and gender diverse favoured by the groups of people \n17\nwho apply these terms for themselves and advocate for them publicly. The umbrella term ‘transgender’ is \nnow used to describe people whose sex assigned at birth does not match how they would like to express their \ngender identity (Donatone & Rachlin, 2013). Transgender people may or may not seek surgical affirmation \nand this is wholly dependent on individual need. Trans is often used instead of the word transgender, and \nencapsulates a number of different identities such as bigender, genderqueer, transsexual or gender questioning. \nTrans is a term of self-identification chosen by someone who wishes to express one of many of the transgender \nidentities and/or does not feel they belong within the man/woman binary. Importantly, although transgender \nand gender diverse identities are in a state of flux, the greatest opportunity for us to understand these more \nprecisely comes from those who identify with these terms. \nResearch\nRecent changes to the availability of body technologies and medical and hormonal interventions are affecting \n(and expanding) the gender diverse demographic, including young people (Jones & Hillier, 2013). Additionally, \nsocio-cultural trends mean young people increasingly identify as ‘other’ to man/woman models of ‘sexed’ \nidentity, positioning themselves as ‘queer’, ‘genderqueer’, and/or ‘gender questioning’ (Cloud, 2005; Lynne \nHillier et al., 2010; Jones & Hillier, 2013; Robinson, Bansel, Denson, Ovenden, & Davies, 2014).\nMost international research on gender diverse and transgender young people is primarily focused on medical \nand psychological interventions, risk determinants, negative pathways, suffering, and social victimisation \n(Carrera, DePalma, & Lameiras, 2012; Donatone & Rachlin, 2013; Menvielle, 2012). This focus, and the \nrecruitment methods resulting from it (i.e. through health service providers), can also reinforce negative \nstereotypes of transgender people as living risky lives. It also mainly focusses on adults (Couch et al., 2007; \nJones, del Pozo de Bolger, Dunne, Lykins, & Hawkes, 2014; Jones, Gray, & Harris, 2014; Pitts, Couch, Mulcare, \nCroy, & Mitchell, 2009); however, there are some issues seen as particularly related to younger groups. A \nrecent UK study, Trans Mental Health Study 2012, explored the process of transitioning (social or medical) and \nhow this impacts upon mental health (J. McNeil, L. Bailey, S. Ellis, J. Morton, & M. Regan, 2012). Using samples \nof people over the age of 18 years across England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (with a final data set of 889 \nparticipants), their findings demonstrated that 63% of the population in mental health services and 65% in \ngeneral health services had had negative experiences associated with their gender identity. Further, 90% of \nparticipants had been told that transgender people were not normal, while 84% had thought of suicide, with at \nleast 35% attempting it. Yet, once someone had medically transitioned, there were significant increases in social \nand mental satisfaction and increased acceptability in the community - findings echoed in Australian research \n(Jones, del Pozo de Bolger, et al., 2014).\nIt has been well documented that lesbian, gay, and bisexual young people can experience higher rates of \nbullying and exclusion than their heterosexual counterparts; however, gender diverse and transgender young \npeople experience even higher rates of bullying and exclusion  (Jones & Hillier, 2013). The degree to which \nintersex young people experience bullying and harassment due to their intersex status is not well documented \nand requires specific exploration. A USA 2010 study, School Climate for Transgender Youth: A Mixed Method \nInvestigation of Student Experiences and School Responses, examined transgender young people’s experience \nof school harassment, school strategies designed to stop harassment, the protective role of supportive \nschool personnel, and responses to harassment, including changing schools and dropping out (J. McGuire, C. \nAnderson, R. Toomey, & S. T. Russell, 2010). The researchers found that transgender young people were being \nsaddled with strategies designed for lesbian, gay, and bisexual young people which had little or nothing to do \nwith gender diverse and transgender identities and needs. It was found that, when school staff and teachers \ntook measures to decrease or stop harassment and discrimination, transgender students were more likely \n18\nto feel safe and supported. Such measures also increased levels of trust between the school and students. \nUnfortunately, this was a rare occurrence and over 80% of transgender participants in the survey reported they \nwere frequently the targets of negative comments and harassment. Clearly, there is a need for school-based \ninterventions that target the sources of harassment and discrimination by educating both staff and students \nthat bullying of transgender students is unacceptable.\nFew studies consider transgender identities beyond the binary of man/woman (Garofalo, Deleon, Osmer, Doll, \n& Harper, 2006; Jones, del Pozo de Bolger, et al., 2014; Jones & Hillier, 2013). The dominant findings have \nrelated to increased sexual risk for HIV infection and lack of relevant sexuality education (Clements-Nolle, \nMarx, Guzman, & Katz, 2001; A. H. Grossman & D’Augelli, 2006; Jones, del Pozo de Bolger, et al., 2014; Jones & \nHillier, 2013; Rosario, 2009); the high risk of familial rejection and (verbal and physical) abuse (A. H. Grossman, \nD’Augelli, & Salter, 2006; Jones & Hillier, 2013; Varjas et al., 2008); and increased risk of discrimination and \nsuicide for this population (Clements-Nolle, Marx, & Katz, 2006; A. H. Grossman & D’Augelli, 2007; Jones, del \nPozo de Bolger, et al., 2014; Jones & Hillier, 2013; Stieglitz, 2010). While it is important to acknowledge the \nsuffering of young people, this literature  mostly overlooks positive pathways and protective factors that may \nalso be present in the lives of these young people. \nA 2010 national study of over 3,000 same-sex attracted and gender questioning young people, Writing \nThemselves In 3, included the largest group in this demographic thus far: 91 Australian young people with \ndiverse gender identities (aged 14–21) (Lynne Hillier et al., 2010; Jones & Hillier, 2013). Compared to same-\nsex attracted young people, they were significantly more likely to have known their sexual identity earlier; \ndisclosed this identity to people in their social or service networks; been rejected by family; and to have \nsuffered physical, discriminatory abuse. They were also significantly more inclined to self-harm and to attempt \nsuicide. Importantly, these same individuals were twice as likely to seek help and engage in activism than their \ncisgender, same-sex attracted peers, and often displayed a sense of pride in their gender identity in the face of \ndiscrimination and adversity. \nAustralian research published in 2014, Growing Up Queer, found that the Internet provided same-sex attracted \nand gender diverse young people with sophisticated understandings about gender, sex, and sexuality, and that \nthis was particularly the case for young people with transgender identities (Robinson, Bansel, Denson, Ovenden, \n& Davies, 2014). Consistent with findings from Writing Themselves In 3, 25% of the young people in this study \nwho had experienced transphobia at school said that these experiences led them to activism (Robinson et al., \n2014). \n19\n20\n21\nChapter 2: Research design\n ↗ This research combined an online survey and online interviews.\n ↗ Community consultation was provided by a Community Advisory Group.\n ↗ Mental health needs and protective factors were explored. \nbeyondblue funded this project to explore both the mental health needs and protective factors of gender \ndiverse and transgender young people in Australia. It aimed to fill a research gap on protective factors around \ndepression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide.  To do so, the project aimed to: \n ↗ Gather evidence regarding risk and protective factors for depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide \nin young people with diverse gender identities;\n ↗ Increase understanding of the meaning of a diverse range of identity elements (including \ntransgender, genderqueer, and gender questioning) from the perspective of the young people to \nwhom they apply;\n ↗ Explore help-seeking patterns for these young people both online and offline, and explore their \nexperiences of health services, education, social networks and social/ activist groups; and \n ↗ Understand what protective factors and behaviours decrease the risk of depression, anxiety, self-\nharm and suicide, and how such factors can be fostered. \nCommunity Advisory Group\nThe research team worked together with transgender, gender diverse, and intersex people (including young \npeople) who work and advocate with these communities to design the wording and content of the survey and \ninterview questions. The Community Advisory Group played a pivotal role in making sure that this research was \napplicable, sensitive, respectful, and useful. Roz Ward, Youth Program Manager at GLHV, chaired the group. \nCommunity Advisory Group Members\nZoe Birkinshaw   Zoe Belle Gender Centre \nSally Goldner  Transgender Victoria \nSim Kennedy  Ygender \nCanon O’Saurus  Ygender \nGina Wilson  OII Australia \nDani Wright Toussaint Freedom Centre\nPartnership with GLHV\nAs part of the grant conditions, this project worked in partnership with GLHV. GLHV promotes the health and \nwellbeing of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in Victoria. GLHV includes the Rainbow \nNetwork and Safe Schools Coalition Victoria, both of which were well placed to enhance this project. Safe \nSchools Coalition Victoria works to combat homophobia and transphobia in schools as well as supporting \nstudents who transition or affirm their gender at school. GLHV convened the Community Advisory Group, \nassisted with survey recruitment through their networks, and aided the design and implementation of \nthis report. They will continue to promote the research through the incorporation of the key findings and \n22\nimplications of those findings into their training packages for teachers, health professionals, policy makers and \nothers.\nRecruitment\nA broad recruitment strategy was used for the online survey. Members of the Community Advisory Group \nused their professional networks to promote the survey and its importance. A media release was distributed \nto various lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex organisations, mainstream community and youth \nservices, and media outlets. A number of online articles were published, including in the queer magazines, LOTL \nand The Star Observer.\nBusiness cards and postcard-sized recruitment flyers were produced that included a QR code that could be \nscanned with a smart phone in order to complete the survey on that platform. These cards were sent to \ngender centres, support groups and queer organisations around Australia. The survey and recruitment material \nincluded a logo of a kite consisting of a colour spectrum of dots. The kite was designed for this project to \nsymbolise the growth (or lifting) and positivity in young people’s lives that needs to be fostered for them to \nreach their potential. \nThe survey was also promoted on the national radio station Triple J, while the community radio station 3CR \nin Melbourne interviewed a member of the Community Advisory Group. Young people were instrumental in \nsharing the survey through their online social networks. Further, various organisations shared a link to the \nsurvey on Facebook and Tumblr multiple times. \nSurvey\n212 people completed the survey across Australia, which was available through an online survey portal \n‘Demographix’. Once the raw data had been cleaned, and cases that did not fit the criteria for inclusion (such \nas age) were removed from the dataset, 189 valid participants remained. The young people spent between 20 \nminutes and over an hour answering the questions and responding to the open-ended questions. The survey \nwas available online as well as on smart phones and tablets. \nThe survey asked questions about the following areas and experiences:\n ↗ Demographic information.\n ↗ Gender identity(ies).\n ↗ Social and medical transitioning.\n23\n ↗ Marker and name changes on official documents.\n ↗ Experiences in current or most recent school.\n ↗ Sexual identity(ies).\n ↗ Experiences of abuse and harassment.\n ↗ Mental health conditions, experiences, and diagnosis.\n ↗ Experiences with health professionals.\n ↗ Family, community, peer, and grassroots supports.\n ↗ The role of activism in their lives.\n ↗ How  knowledge about gender diversity and gender identity(ies) was gained.\n ↗ What an ideal world would look like for these young people. \nThe survey asked both closed (multiple-choice) and open-ended (text-based) questions. The open-ended \nquestions did not contain any word limit, allowing participants to provide qualitative answers of a length \nand depth with which they felt comfortable. Questions about mental health conditions did not include any \ndiagnostic scales. We did not want to repeat the history of pathologising of transgender and gender diverse \nindividuals. Instead, we wanted the young people to feel that they were in control of their decisions about \ndisclosing their mental health experiences and conditions.\nThe quantitative data allowed some normative statistics to emerge about this group of young people, while \nthe qualitative aspect has allowed us to find out more, particularly in relation to the protective mechanisms \nthat these young people use to feel better and reduce levels of suicide ideation (thoughts about suicide) and \nself-harm. Building on previous research (Lynne Hillier et al., 2010; Jones & Hillier, 2013), we were also able to \nexplore the role of activism in these young people’s lives.\nInterviews\nThis research used an online instant messenger platform that allowed for real-time interviews with 16 \nyoung people. This interview technique has many benefits for working with young people and people from \nmarginalised communities. It is an interview technique that allows participants to be visibly anonymous to the \ninterviewer. In this way, it has the potential to provide comfort to participants who may feel shy or nervous \nabout meeting with an interviewer. Further, and importantly for this research, online text-based interviewing \nallowed the young people to participate without their bodies being seen by the interviewer, thus reducing any \npotential discomfort the young people may feel about how their gender identity is being read in this context. \nThis technique also allowed for the participation of young people from anywhere in Australia where there was \nInternet access. The 16 young people who participated in interviews were from Victoria, New South Wales, \nQueensland, Western Australia, Australian Capital Territory, and Tasmania. Online interviews allowed the \ninterviewers to work around the young people’s schedules and, with the interview participants being aged \nbetween 14 and 25 years old, this sometimes meant conducting interviews in the evenings. For at least one \ninterview participant, this flexibility meant that they could participate in the interview in the evening when they \nwould not be interrupted by their parents to whom they were not out about their gender identity. \nThe interview was designed to explore the protective factors and included questions such as ‘what do you do \nto make yourself feel better about being discriminated against or harassed?’ The interview also sought to draw \nout the young people’s experience of, and feelings about, engagement in activism as well as how they accessed \nknowledge about sex, gender, and gender identity(ies). \n24\nAnalysis\nBoth the survey and interview data were analysed with assistance from computer programs and in accordance \nwith the research aims in the Introduction to this report. The statistical data were downloaded to the Statistical \nPackage for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 21) where participants’ answers were compared and percentages \nand cross tabulations were generated. \nAt a statistical level, contingency tables (frequencies) and cross tabulations were undertaken. Phi, Cramer’s \nV, and z-tests were performed to determine statistically significant results. All results in this report have a \nprobability of random error lower than .05, with many below .01 (P<.05). The P-values have not been included \nin this report to facilitate readability, but can be provided on request. \nThe open-ended responses and interview data were analysed in the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis \nsoftware (CAQDAS), NVivo, version 10. These narratives were coded according to the interview schedule as well \nas in reference to themes that emerged within these. Other themes were also identified.\nEthical considerations and approval\nThere were many ethical considerations in carrying out this research. Previous research shows that gender \ndiverse and transgender young people become aware early in their lives that their gender identity(ies) do not \nmatch their sex assigned at birth (Lynne Hillier et al., 2010). Further, transgender and gender diverse young \npeople are disproportionately more likely to self-harm and experience suicidal thoughts than their cisgender \nsame-sex attracted peers (L. Hillier et al., 2010a). Due to these two findings, it was imperative that people under \nthe age of 18 were able to participate in this research. In order to protect the young people from being outed to \ntheir family, the young people did not need to gain parental or guardian consent to participate in this research. \nOnline interviews with young people aged younger than 18 years were conducted by an interviewer with a \nVictorian Working with Children Check.\nEvery effort was made to keep young people’s participation in this research anonymous. Where names appear \nin this report, they are either pseudonyms (fake names) chosen by the interview participants themselves, \nor a name given to the survey participants by the researchers to present their open-ended data. Each open-\nended response includes the gender identity chosen by the participant along with their age. For the interview \nparticipants, the gender identity that most closely relates to how they described their identity is given. This \nresearch gained approval from ethics committees at La Trobe University and the University of New England.\nLimitations of this research\nDespite all good intentions to include, and be relevant to, intersex young people in Australia, this research, and \nthe findings in this report, are severely lacking in this regard. Ten young people (around 5% of the sample) who \nfilled out the survey nominated that they were intersex; however, upon exploring these young people’s open-\nended responses to some of the other questions, it appeared that some (but not all) of the young people who \nchose this option had done so mistakenly. Future research that intends to include intersex people may wish to \nprovide a definition of intersex as a preface to this question. \nFurther to the lack of intersex participants, this survey did not include many questions that are relevant to \nintersex young people; for example, intersex infants in Australia (and around the world) often undergo cosmetic \ngenital surgery to align their bodies with socially conventional notions of gendered bodies. The impact that this \ncan have on young people’s mental and general health, and wellbeing, desperately needs to be explored. Given \n25\nthis, and the general lack of social research in this area, we strongly recommend that intersex-specific research \nshould be carried out to explore the unique human rights issues, discrimination, marginalisation, homophobia \nand transphobia that intersex people face, and the specific mental health risks and protective factors that \nare relevant for them. When further research is carried out with intersex young people, researchers should \nbe mindful that questions relevant to transgender and gender diverse people are not necessarily relevant \nto intersex people. The failure to do so in the survey for this current research is a limitation that may have \ncontributed to the small response rate from intersex young people.\nThe survey population was heavily skewed towards young people who were assigned female at birth and this \nshould be taken into account when interpreting the results. Further research may specifically target different \ngroups under the transgender and gender diverse umbrellas (e.g. Male Assigned at Birth) in order to explore \nthe different challenges and protective factors pertaining to them. \nThe recruitment drive was mainly carried out by support services (both online and offline) and this may \nrepresent a bias in the data towards young people who are already connected to peers and support groups. This \nconvenience sample is therefore mostly representative of young people who are already connected to gender \ndiverse communities or peers. Other young people who, due to the lack of visibility in mainstream media, may \nnot have the language to describe their experience of their gender identity and/or who do not have access to \nsupport groups, may have missed out on participating in this study.\n26\n27\nChapter 3: Demographics\n ↗ 189 young people aged 14- 25 participated in the online survey.\n ↗ 16 young people participated in online interviews.\n ↗ 55% were either studying or studying and working; 16.5% were unemployed.\n \nYoung people from all over Australia participated in the online survey and interviews, including people from \nrural and urban contexts. They ranged in age from 14 to 25 years, with a spread of ages represented. The \naverage age was 19 years and the middle 50% were aged between 16 and 22 years (one standard deviation \nbetween these two ages). \nAGE OF PARTICIPANTS\n5% 10% 15% 20%\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23 \n24 \n25\n3%\n5%\n9%\n12%\n13%\n5%\n11%\n9%\n8%\n9%\n9%\n8%\n(n=189)\n28\nBackground and location\nEighty-four per cent of young people were born in Australia, 5% in England, and 3% New Zealand.

Four per cent (n=8) of young people were Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, or both.

(n=108)\n29\nMain occupation and schooling\nThirty-five per cent of the young people were full-time students. This was followed by unemployed young \npeople (16.5%), which was higher than the national rate of 12.5% for 15 to 24 year olds (Brotherhood of St \nLaurence, 2014). There were also students who were employed part time (15%), people who were employed \nfull-time (8.5%) or part-time (7%), and young people who did not work due to a disability (2%) or due to caring \nresponsibilities (1%). Taken together, 50% of all of the participants were currently studying and this was higher \nfor participants aged 14-17 years (72%, n=39), followed by young people aged 18-21 years (49%, n=27), and 22-\n25 year olds (35.5%, n=28). These rates are similar to 2012 national levels where 73% of Australian teenagers \nwere engaged in full-time study, as well as 50% of school leavers (i.e. in higher education), and 31% of young \nadults (Foundation for Young Australians, 2012); however, it is not known whether the young people in this \ncurrent research were studying full-time or part-time, as this was not asked. \nThe majority of young people were, or had most recently, attended a government school or institution for \ntheir secondary education (amounting to 67%, which is slightly higher than the National average of 66% in \n2010) followed by Catholic or other Christian school (18% compared to 20% of the national average in 2010), \nand other independent school (16% compared to the national average of 14%) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, \n2010). \nNT 1%\nIndependent   16% \nGovernment   67% \nCatholic or other christian  18% \nMOST RECENT SCHOOLING\nBY SCHOOL TYPE\n18%\n67%\n16%\n(n=188)\n30\nSex Assigned at Birth\nThe majority of young people indicated that they were assigned female at birth (72.5%). Fifty young people \n(26.5%) were assigned male at birth and two young people chose ‘other’. When asked to specify, these young \npeople wrote ‘genderqueer’ and ‘genderless’. \nRelationship Status \nParticipants were most likely to be in a monogamous relationship (29%), followed by single and looking for a \nrelationship (28.6%), single and not looking for a relationship (24%), in a non-monogamous (open) relationship \n(7%), in a polyamorous (consensual relationships with multiple people or more than one person) (4%), and \nother (7%). \n31\nWillow\n17 years old     gender questioning \nI hope that I’ll find someone who’ll stop \nmaking me care about who I identify as and \ncome to an acceptance of the limitations \nof my body and the freedom of my mind. \nI want to do something big in the world \nand I promise you that I’ll make it happen. I \nwant a change in the way we view sexuality \nand gender not only in the western world \nbut in countries [in] which discrimination \nis still a pervasive part of everyday life. I \nwant to write, act and essentially be an \noutspoken humanitarian and advocate of \nhuman rights, sexuality and gender identity, \nto both challenge and unify people all over \nthe world and make a better and more \naccepting world for my children and anyone \nwho has gone through the pain and anguish \nof institutionalised discrimination.\n32\n ↗ 26% identified as Girl or Woman, Boy or Man.\n ↗ 26% identified as either Genderqueer or Genderfluid.\n33\nChapter 4: Gender \nDespite the growing diversity of gender identities, research does not often explore the way in which people \nrelate to and/or use these terms (Kuper, Nussbaum, & Mustanski, 2012). One reason for the lack of research \nin this area may be the speed at which young people in particular develop new terminology and meaning for \ntheir own gender identity(ies). This research has shown, once again, that many young people are resisting \nthe idea of fixed gender-identity categories. While a significant proportion of participants identified with the \n‘opposite’ gender from the sex they were assigned at birth, there were also high numbers of young people who \nidentified with terms that resisted or rejected the binary notion of gender. It is also worth noting that although \n15 categories were given as options, 2% of participants still chose ‘other’.\nAllowing young people to describe their own gender identities and expression has been found to increase \nyoung people’s resilience (Singh, Meng, & Hansen, 2014). It is clear that young people understand their own \ngender in highly personal ways which are not necessarily attached to a fixed category. Many of the young \npeople took the time to describe the complexities of their gender identity as part of their sense of self; for \nexample, Alex (15yrs), who participated in an interview, told us:\nI identify as agender, which to me means that I don’t feel a presence of gender, although I think \nCURRENT GENDER IDENTITY\noF PArtiCiPANtS\n5% 10% 15% 20%\nGenderqueer\nBoy or Man\nGirl or Woman\nGenderfluid\nNo Gender or Agender\nTrans Boy or Trans Man\nFTM\nTrans Girl or Trans Woman\nMTF\nTrans* \nQuestioning \nAndrogynous \nBi-gender \nOther\nBrotherboy\n13%\n13%\n6%\n5%\n6%\n6%\n5%\n1%\n4%\n16%\n2%\n2%\n7%\n10%\n4%\n(n=192)\n34\nI may be bigender/genderfluid with agender and neutral gender, as in sometimes I feel a neutral \ngender presence and sometimes I don’t feel like I have a gender at all.\nGender in Relation to Sex Assigned at Birth\nThe majority of young people who chose either ‘man’ or ‘woman’ gender identity categories were assigned an \n‘opposite’ ‘female’ or ‘male’ sex at birth. A few individuals (n=20) chose a gender identity that ‘matched’ their \nsex assigned at birth. It was interesting to find that these young people also indicated that they had, or wanted \nto, socially transition. One young person who identified as a woman and who was assigned female at birth told \nus that, for her, ‘transitioning entails changing my appearance and mannerisms based on my whims of the day’. \nSean, a 22 year old who participated in an interview, also described this ambiguity:\nI identify as a feminine young male. For me this means I fit into identities and subcultures \nassociated with the queer community, but I personally don’t embrace or identify with trans* \nidentities. Identity, to me, is my self-concept. I think it can be fluid, but haven’t found it \nparticularly so in my case. \nIn order to compare the experiences of those who may fit under the gender diverse umbrella with those \nwho may fit more closely with transgender, the 15 gender categories were collected into four categories \n(transgender, gender diverse, questioning, and other). The ‘transgender’ group contained individuals who \nidentified with man, woman, FTM, MTF, trans man, trans woman, and Brotherboy (there were no Sistergirls \nwho completed the survey). Categories that were included in the ‘gender diverse’ group were androgynous, \ngenderqueer, bi-gender, no gender/agender, and genderfluid. Once this variable had been transformed, 50% \n(n=83) could be classed as transgender, 34% (n=57) gender diverse, 11% (n=18) questioning, and 5% (n=8) \nother.\nFrom the sixteen young people who took part in interviews, nine described gender-diverse identities. Their \nnarratives highlight how complicated each individual’s relationship is with their gender identity, and the many \nfactors that influence how young people explore this at different times and in different contexts. One interview \nparticipant, Charlie (20yrs), explained this in the following way: \nMy gender identity, I would describe as genderqueer. That is to say that, I never saw myself \nas a girl (by birth sex) but couldn’t see myself as a boy. I use the word genderqueer because \ntransgender doesn’t fit and I don’t stick to one side or the other in regards to gender. But, before \nnot knowing that it was a thing, I tried to identify as a girl. I think my gender identity is important \nto me because it dictates a lot of my life. I tend to perform like a female, but the struggle to \nmaintain this for social reasons is challenging. So, gender identity and being able to define myself \nto myself gives me a sense of comfort.\nAnother interview participant, Eli (20yrs), explained how the notion of gender felt irrelevant to how they felt as \nan individual and how they wanted to be defined by other people:\nAt this stage Gender Queer is what makes the most sense. My gender identity does not align with \nmale or female, and my being socialised as female does not conform with whatever innate sense \nof self that I have either. I am most comfortable within myself and as a member of society as a \nperson defined through character and principles rather than through my gender/sex.\nFourteen-year-old interview participant, Theo, spoke about how they did not necessarily identify with one \n35\ngender identity term, and how their experience of gender, shifted. They said, \nI identify as nonbinary, which is kind of a vague term but I don’t really feel like any of the specific \nwords fit me right. \nAnother interview participant, twenty-four-year-old Charlotte, who identified as a trans woman, explained how \nbeing transgender was not necessarily as straightforward as being assigned a sex at birth but identifying with a \ndifferent gender.\nGender identity means everything about you on the inside and how you fit. Personally, I identify \nas female but there are times where I identify as male. This can be expressed as the gender \nnorms.\nSam (22yrs) spoke about how they currently identified as gender non-conforming but they had previously \nstarted transitioning from female to male. When asked what advice Sam would give other young people, \nthey spoke about gender identity as an individual journey and that it was important to resist other people’s \nexpectations and to go at your own pace.\nI’ve literally just changed from the medical intervention category (transgender/transsexual) and \nmoved into non-op (gender non conforming/gender queer). You only know what’s right for you. \nJust listen to yourself. There may be pressure, like when I was ftm, there was this competitive “Are \nyou on hormones? Have you got top surgery?” It was nuts. Just go your own pace and if your \nidentity changes, it’s not the end of the world. People change.\nAnother young person, Siobhan (22yrs), explained in her interview that she currently identified as a woman:\nI’m female, or rather, I’m a woman (or girl, I guess, depending how you perceive age). It’s the \nlabel that I find fits me best. More than any of the alternatives, anyway. And I guess I feel it fits \nme because how I (like to) express myself aligns with what women in society do. I think that’s \nit, really. If I got to decide to be anything, whatever it meant, and I was given a blank space \nand could write whatever I want, I’d write female. And I don’t really see my gender identity as \ndifferent from a ciswoman’s in that respect. They identify as female, as do I.\nGender Identity and Age\nNearly one third of the young people told us that they had questioned their gender identity for as long as they \ncould remember (32%, n=61), and 60% (n=114) nominated a specific age. The youngest was aged 3 and the \noldest was 24. Within this range, the average age that the young people began questioning their gender identity \nwas 14. Only 7.4% (n=14) said that they had never questioned their sex assigned at birth. Questioning gender \nidentity can be a complex process that does not necessarily begin and end at a specific time; for example, one \nyoung person told us that they started to question their gender identity when they were ‘24 but somewhere \ndeep inside earlier’, pointing to an ongoing development of a very personal sense of gender. These data \nillustrate the need for schools, community and health service providers to provide appropriate support for \ntransgender and gender diverse young people of all ages. \n36\nPronouns\nParticipants were asked to select one or more pronouns that they prefer to use and be referred to as. The most \npopular pronouns that young people chose were ‘she’ (46%) and ‘he’ (42%); however, a significant proportion \n(35%) also chose the singular ‘they’ as a pronoun that they feel comfortable applying to their gender identity. \nFurthermore, 20% indicated that they ‘don’t care’ what pronoun is used to describe them, which could be \nrelated to their sense of safety or comfort, or further point to the move towards diverse gender identities. \nPREFERRED PRONOUN/S\noF PArtiCiPANtS           \n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%\nShe\nHe\nSingular ‘They’\nDon’t Care\nNot Sure \nZe\nOther\nYo\n35%\n2%\n20%\n42%\n46%\n3.7%\n7%\n6.9%\n(n=192)\n37\nTenson\n22 years old     Boy / man \nI guess my transitioning is more about retraining \nmy perception of myself as a gendered person. I \nlike to challenge my own ideas, beliefs and ethos \netc. It started with my exploration as a sexual \nbeing, not identifying with the ‘gay’ male label, I \nmet a queer identifying American girl, and I had \nnever really connected with anyone on a sexual \nlevel like I had with her. I started questioning my \nself-expression after a close friend of mine had \nshaved her head. I can’t remember exactly what \nshe had said but it was something about allowing \nother people to question how they react and \ntreat her in social situations, especially in regards \nto older male identifiers. I met a drag queen in \na course and decided I’d let them and their drag \nfamily show me the ropes. I’ve never had more \nprofound experiences as a gendered person than \nI had in my drag facade, it was like the metaphor \nabout walking in someone else’s shoes. Except \nI experienced everything, that the other person \nin those shoes would experience, woah. It was \nboth very liberating and very alienating: I think I \nremember feeling hyper sexualised and objectified, \nand the human reactions I encountered were \nvery far between being incredibly receptive/nice \nto very tormenting/almost violent. It was a big \nwake up call. I now try and keep a fluidity to my \nexpression, and present an ambiguous mood with \nmy wardrobe. I sometimes feel very dysphoric in \nmy body but I also love my body and I probably \nwont change it.\n38\n39\nChapter 5: Transition\n ↗ 77% of participants had socially transitioned, or were currently socially transitioning; a further 7% \nwanted to socially transition in the future.\n ↗ 26% of participants had undertaken, or were currently undertaking, a medical transition.\n ↗ 40% of participants said they did not want, or were unsure about, a medical transition.  \nDefinitions of Transition\n‘Transition’ is a complex term that holds different meanings in different contexts for different people. Commonly \nunderstood to mean moving from one thing to another (e.g. childhood to adulthood), the process of transition \nsuggests a journey where a person leaves one situation (e.g. set of physical attributes, name, pronoun, etc.) and \narrives at another. Participants in this research explained transition as becoming or affirming the gender that \nthey always knew they were on the inside, or as a way of expressing their (non)gender(s) without conforming to \nthe binary notion of gender; for example, one young person (22yrs) explained that transitioning for them was \n‘being perceived outwardly and treated in the same way that I perceive myself’. Another (21yrs) said, for them, \ntransition meant ‘becoming the person I feel internally, and making it visible externally’. For many this did not \nnecessarily mean affirming a normative expression of either man or woman.\nNot conforming to the socially accepted rules of my gender. I feel as though I am an extreme \nversion of a tomboy, though I still have long hair and wear skirts/dresses because I feel freer in \nthem. But I have made physical changes/choices—I don’t wear make-up, I don’t shave, I don’t \nwear heels, I don’t wear bras very often … and I feel I have a male persona, at least some times \n(gender questioning young person, 18 yrs).\nI don’t really see it as transitioning for myself personally, because I doubt I will ever go “all the \nway” to “male” from “female”. I have changed parts of my name, have changed my pronouns \nand just the fact that I identify openly as trans. However I still wear the same clothes, do the \nsame things, my life just makes more sense now. I think transitioning is a term used for the trans* \npeople that really want to change gender, whereas I just want to be acknowledged for who I am \nand that doesn’t involve transitioning, because most things are staying the same! (Trans*, 25yrs).\nFor some, transitioning was about finding a way to express both binary genders, as one genderfluid (23yrs) \nyoung person explained: ‘for me it means to experience an extreme lifestyle change. I wish to spend half my life \nas a cissexed male AND half as a female, but my gender will always be a fluid expression of self’. \n40\nSocial transitioning (which was described in the survey as a change of things like clothes, name and pronouns) \nwas a much more common experience for the young people than medical transition. 77% were currently \nsocially transitioning, or felt that they had already done so in all or some areas of their lives. A further 7% \nexpressed a desire to socially transition in the future. Young people described social transitioning in various \nways. For one young agender/no gender young person (16yrs) transitioning was a way to manage other \npeople’s expectations about gender:\nTransitioning for me isn’t so much about changing my image as it is reducing the amount that \npeople try to place stereotypes on me because of my sex. I don’t want people assuming what I do \nor want to do simply because of the way some parts of me are.\nAnother young person (gender queer, 16yrs) questioned the notion of ‘transitioning’ in light of identifying \nwith more than one gender. They said: “since I identify as sorta male, sorta female … ‘transitioning’ for me was \ncutting my hair, shortening my name to a unisex one and buying more gender neutral clothes”. \nI do not want to, or \nI am unsure about \nsocial transition.\nI am currently, or \nI have already socially \ntranisitioned.\nI want to socially  \ntransition in the future.\nSOCIAL TRANSITIONING\nCUrreNt StAGe oF PArtiCiPANtS\n7%\n77%\n15%\n(n=175)\n41\nI do not want to, or \nI am unsure about \nmedical transition.\nI am currently, or \nI have already medically \ntranisitioned.\nI want to medically  \ntransition in the future.\nMEDICAL TRANSITIONING\nCUrreNt StAGe oF PArtiCiPANtS\n40%\n33%\n27%\nThirty per cent (n=17) of the young people who identified with identities under the ‘gender diverse’ umbrella \ndid not want to medically transition, while 34% (n=19) of these young people were unsure about medical \ntransitioning at this time. The young people who identified with gender identities that fit within ‘transgender’ \ncategories were more likely to tell us that they were currently medically transitioning (45%, n=37) than were \ngender diverse young people (2%, n=1). They were also less likely to feel unsure about transitioning (3.6%, \nn=3) compared to gender diverse participants (38%, n=21). For some young people, transitioning was linked to \ntheir feelings of mental wellbeing. One young person (23yrs) said: ‘transitioning was a way to help prevent my \nsuicide.’ Another young person (MTF, 21yrs) described transition as not only about affirmation of their gender \nidentity, but as a way to gain acceptance of this from friends and family. They desired:\na FULL transition, i.e. name, clothes, sex reassignment surgery, facial feminisation surgery (where \nneeded), laser/electrolysis hair removal (important), building a healthy female body and most \nimportantly acceptance from family and friends.\n(n=175)\n42\nMany gender diverse and transgender people wish to change their sex/gender marker and/or name on their \nofficial documents (such as Birth Certificates, passports and school records) in order to affirm their gender \nidentity. Currently, many of these official documents lie within State and Territory jurisdictions, with the \nexception of Australian passports which are a federal matter. With the exception of Australian passports (which \nnow include a third sex category ‘x’), official Australian documents mostly adhere to the restrictive binary \nnotion of sex, male/female, and do not cater to people who identify with gender-diverse categories such as \nagender. The six states and two territories impose various conditions that need to be met before changes to \nthese documents can take place; for example, most of the states do not allow a married person to apply to \nchange their sex on their birth certificate, forcing people to choose between legal recognition of their gender \nidentity and the legal recognition of their relationship. Further, many States require that individuals undergo sex \nreassignment surgery before they can apply for these changes (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2009, p. \n23). \nGiven the role that changing such documents can play in an individual’s affirmation of their gender identity, we \nasked the young people to nominate the documents on which they would like to change their gender marker \nand/or name, which documents they had already changed, and which ones they did not want to change. Most \nyoung people wanted to change their marker or name on all documents. The passport was the most popular \ndocument that young people wanted to change and, in Australia, this is one of the easiest documents to alter. \nThe documents that had already been most commonly changed were ‘birth certificate’ and ‘driver’s licence’ \n(17% of young people having already changed both).\nSchool Records\nDriver’s License\nBirth Certificate\nPassport\nProof of Age Card\nCHANGING OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS\nCUrreNt StAGe oF PArtiCiPANtS\nN=169\nI have\n9%\n17%\n17%\n10%\n13%\n41%\n42%\n37%\n54%\n50%\n33%\n24%\n30%\n27%\n28%\n12% 5%\n17%\n16%\n8%\n9%\nI want to I don’t want to I legally can’t N/A\n43\nErin\n17 years old     Agender \nI don’t see it happening but I hope for a \ntime where people won’t expect people to \nabide by a certain gender because of their \nphysical sex or outwards appearance. I also \nhope for less sexism and discrimination for \ncertain genders.\nI very much hope that within the gender \ndiverse community that people will stop \nholding others to their own standards—i.e. \nthinking that someone can only identify as \na woman if they abide by the entirety of \nthat gender stereotype. I hope people can \nrealise an individual might still like to play \nsports and like cars and still identify as a \nwomen.\nI also hope that in the LGBTI community, \nthat transgender and intersex people \ncan stop being left behind. It seems like \nlesbians, gays and bisexual people are \nbecoming more accepted and having laws \nwhich relate to them (i.e. gay marriage) \nbut T and I are still stuck under oppression \nand discrimination.\nI know a lot of people who are gender \ndiverse commit suicide (I recently \nresearched Transgender and Trans* \ndiscrimination in Australian healthcare \nand found that something like, that trans* \nindividuals suicide risk is 12 times higher \nthan the general population).

I don’t have a \nparticular dream, it’s something I will think \nabout. I feel as though being trapped as \nfemale limited me in so many ways; such \nas relationships—romantic and social, \nstudies, jobs, everything!\nOnce I’m further along in my transition and \nhappier, confident with myself, I intend to \nseriously think about what to do now that I \nam “me”. I dropped out of my TAFE studies \ndue to my psychological meltdown and \nnot being able to leave the house until I \nbegan transition. So my first step will be to \nresearch what to study, what career path \nto take and what suits me. Then I’ll travel, \nmake friends, engage in relationships and \njust enjoy life like I hadn’t before.\n44\n ↗ 50% of young people identified as either pansexual or queer.\n ↗ Participants were least likely to identify with the terms homosexual (2%), \nasexual (3%) gay (5%) or heterosexual (5%).\n ↗ 12% chose ‘not sure’, ‘questioning’ or ‘other’ to describe their sexual identity.\n45\nCURRENT SEXUAL IDENTITY\noF PArtiCiPANtS                       N=189\n5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30%\nQueer\nPansexual\nLesbian\nBisexual\nNot Sure / Questioning\nOther\nGay\nHeterosexual\nAsexual\nHomosexual \n5%\n12%\n2%\n5%\n11%\n3%\n23%\n27%\n6%\n6%\nChapter 6: Sexuality\nThe young people in this research were most likely to identify with sexual identities that did not denote the \ngender(s) of either the person of their attractions or themselves. The combined total of those who identified as \n‘Pansexual’ or ‘Queer’ was fifty per cent, sixty per cent when including the young people who chose ‘Bisexual’.\nGender diversity and sexuality are often conflated in popular culture and discussion, despite gender identity(ies) \nand sexual identity(ies) being two separate aspects of an individual’s sense of self. Many people relate to a \nvariety of both gender and sexuality identities that can also change during their lifetime. Furthermore, the \ncategory of ‘sexuality’ often conflates behaviour, desire and pleasure despite the fact that these aspects may \nnot necessarily link to a fixed identity. Research with same-sex attracted and gender questioning young people \nin Australia found that they understood their sexual identities in highly personal and self-reflective ways \n(Jones, del Pozo de Bolger, et al., 2014; Jones & Hillier, 2013). This complexity was evident in the way that the \ntransgender and gender diverse young people in this research understood their sexual attractions, behaviours, \ndesires, and identities. \nGender diverse or transgender young people may have already challenged the belief that gender is restricted \nto a binary and therefore may be more likely to challenge the notion that sexual attraction is dependent on the \nsex or gender of the person of desire; for example, a genderqueer young person (16yrs) in this research told us \nthat “being queer [was] about rejecting heteronormativity and cissexism”. Other young people in this research \nalso challenged restrictive notions of sexual desire and noted individual aspects that they were attracted to that \nwere not dependent on a person’s sex or gender identity:\n46\nPansexuality for me, is not basing my romantic or sexual attraction on gender or sex. There \nare many other characteristics that prevail in importance such as physical attraction, spiritual \nconnection, intelligence, cultural similarities which decide whether I want to begin a romantic/\nsexual relationship with someone. Gender and sex doesn’t matter. If I’m attracted to someone \nit’s not going to stop me if they are a certain gender or possess certain genatalia (no gender/\nagender, 17yrs).\nAge was a factor in young people’s choice of identity. Those aged between 22 and 25 were more likely to \nchoose ‘queer’, while those aged between 14 and 21 were more likely to choose ‘pansexual’. Pansexual has also \nbeen popular in other Australian research when young people were given similar options (Jones, del Pozo de \nBolger, et al., 2014). \nI am primarily sexually and emotionally attracted to cis gendered women, but because I have \nalso been attracted to cis-men, trans men and women, and androgynous people, I choose to \nnot identify as a lesbian. Personally, I prefer to identify as queer rather than pansexual, as “sex” \nand “sexual” do not always factor in to who I am attracted to and how I am attracted (eg. \nemotionally, spiritually). Queer culture and community are important to me and my sense of \nidentity. “Queer” feels like less of a label and more of a state of being and interacting with the \nworld (girl/woman, 24yrs).\nThe sexuality categories with which the young people identified sometimes changed as they explored their \n(non)gender(s). Some participants focussed on attraction rather than identity in order to subvert assumptions \nbeing made about their gender based on their sexuality. Sexual identity(ies) also came with communities \nattached to them, and, for some young people, this affected the categories with which they chose to publically \nidentify even if their desires, attractions and behaviours were more ambiguous. One young person (25yrs) took \nmany factors into account when they thought about sexuality:\nOriginally it meant to me that I was attracted to and fell in love with people of the same sex as \nme. I guess now that I am trans that is no longer accurate for me. I can confidently say I am only \nattracted to women, so when people ask my sexuality I like best to say “attracted to women” \nbecause that doesn’t need my gender to be specific. I suppose I really just identify as queer, \nhowever I spent so long in the gay/homo community that I feel very attached to the description \nand want to keep it!\nAsexuality\nIndividuals who identify as asexual may experience greater levels of stigma than those who identify as same-\nsex attracted or bisexual and, as such, may have worse mental health outcomes than other groups (Yule, \nBrotto, & Gorzalka, 2013). In this current research, three per cent of the young people identified with this \nterm. While this number is small, it is only slightly smaller than the percentage of participants who identified as \nheterosexual (5%) or gay (5%) and is higher than those who identified as homosexual (2%). The numbers were \ntoo small, however, to undertake correlations with other questions in the survey. Many of the nine individuals \nwho identified with the term ‘asexual’ told us what this meant to them, including one young person (17yrs) \nwho explained that identifying as asexual meant that they were ‘not sexually attracted to anyone, regardless of \ngender’, and another young person (21yrs) told us:\n47\nI am sex repulsed and uninterested in sexual relationships but recognise that I have sexual \nappreciation of others.\nRomantic and/or sexual attraction\nSome of the young people made a distinction between romantic attraction and sexual attraction in their open-\nended responses. As one young trans man/boy (25yrs) explained: “I am romantically attracted to women and \ntransmen and sexually attracted to all genders including cismen”. Other young people explained this as follows:\nI am romantically, emotionally and physically attracted to males and females in whatever form be \nthey cis, trans, intersex and especially androgynous. I would marry a male or a female depending \non who I fell in love with. I am equally attracted to both genders romantically though I am more \nsexually attracted to females (questioning, 18yrs).\nAnother said:\nI class myself as panromantic I like to have romantic relationships not sexual (genderfluid, 21yrs).\nThe young people in this research were most likely to identify with sexual identities that did not denote the \ngender(s) of either the object of their attractions or themselves. In doing so they creatively carved-out spaces \nfor themselves where they are able to experience sexual desire, pleasure, attraction and identity in ways that do \nnot pin them down to restrictive gender identities or expressions. \nEden\n21 years old     Genderqueer \nI consider myself a gay male woman. I am \ncomfortable with my male anatomy, am \nprimarily attracted to (effeminate) men and \nconsider my relations to be “same-sex”. \nHowever, I expect others to call me ‘she’ \nand see me as female in all other areas. \nOccasionally, when I am attracted to women, I \nam attracted to them on the basis of the female \naspects of myself. So attraction for me is always, \nin some sense, same-sex. I am also attracted \nto non-binary people or people who push the \nbinary.\n48\n49\nChapter 7: School\n ↗ Gender diverse and transgender students attended all types of Australian schools. They were more \nlikely to attend alternative schools than the general population.\n ↗ Over half of the participants rated their schools’ sexuality and puberty education as mostly \ninappropriate.\n ↗ Participants who did not feel supported by their teachers were over four times more likely to leave \nschool if they experienced discrimination than were those with teacher support.\n ↗ Inclusive schools were those where leadership and teachers tried to address students with their \npreferred personal pronouns, were flexible about uniform and toilet arrangements, took a stand \nagainst bullying, and aimed to be accommodating to the individual’s needs. \nPast research has highlighted the vital role that school leadership, teachers, school environment and peers \nplayed in the mental health and wellbeing of gender diverse and transgender young people in school contexts \n(Jones & Hillier, 2013; J. K. McGuire, C. R. Anderson, R. B. Toomey, & S. T. Russell, 2010). Gender diverse and \ntransgender young people have been found to experience more harassment, discrimination and abuse than \ntheir cisgender, same-sex attracted peers (A. H. Grossman & D’Augelli, 2006; Jones & Hillier, 2013), and that \nthis can also come from school leadership and teachers themselves (Kosciw & Diaz, 2005). Previous Australian \nresearch has also highlighted that transgender people are twice as likely not to complete their formal required \nschooling years due to unsupportive environments (Jones, del Pozo de Bolger, et al., 2014). This underscores the \nimportance of actively improving school support for these students, and the importance  of inclusive practice in \nresponse to gender diversity and sexual diversity.\nLegal Rights at School\nThe right of same-sex attracted, gender diverse and transgender students to an equal education is protected \nin international human rights law (United Nations, 2012). In Australia, the 2013 SDA Amendment Act (Sexual \nOrientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) consolidated five pieces of federal anti-discrimination \nlegislation into one act and provided the first legal protection from discrimination based on intersex status in \nAustralia. Despite efforts to have them removed, exemptions for religious schools were allowed in the new law \nin relation to gender identity (The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, 2013). This \nmeans that some religious private schools in Australia are given permission to discriminate against transgender \nand gender diverse students. Intersex students are not included in these exemptions due to the biological basis \nof intersex status. \nThe young people in this research attended Government schools (47%), Catholic schools (10%), other Christian \nschools (8%), private schools (10%), TAFE and other institutions providing secondary education (19%), and \nother schools, including, for example, distance education (6%). It is clear that transgender and gender diverse \nstudents could be in any type of Australian school system—including those in which there may be little \nprotection or support for them; however, our data show they are less likely to attend mainstream government \neducation systems compared to the nearly two thirds of the general population in those systems (Australian \nBureau of Statistics, 2013), and are more likely to complete their secondary studies through alternative \ncontexts such as TAFE. In order to explore what constitutes a safe and inclusive school environment for these \nyoung people, this section of the report looks at school supports—teachers, peers, sexuality education, school \nprovisions and, collectively, school cultures that foster positive mental health and wellbeing.\n50\nSCHOOL FACILITIES AND PRACTISES  \nAS rANkeD By PArtiCiPANtS\nMostly appropriate Mostly inappropriate Don’t Know / N/A\nRelevant inclusive counselling\nSchool events or formal\nTeachers using my prefered name or pronoun\nUniform\nLeadership using my prefered name or pronouns\nRespect for my desire for privacy\nChanging rooms\nSports or PE classes\nSupport for my activism\nGender segregation\nSchool camps\nToilets\nRelevant inclusive puberty education\nRelevant or inclusive sexuality education\n30%\n39%\n29%\n29%\n27%\n23%\n21%\n21%\n21%\n18%\n17%\n14%\n12%\n9%\n36%\n32%\n22%\n33%\n22%\n25%\n41%\n33%\n30%\n43%\n32%\n41%\n55%\n66%\n35%\n29%\n49%\n38%\n51%\n52%\n38%\n46%\n49%\n39%\n51%\n45%\n33%\n25%\n(n=186)\n51\nGender diverse and transgender young people require appropriate supports at school both for their educational \nand general wellbeing and to ensure that they experience school as a safe space (Toomey, McGuire, & \nRussell, 2012). To find out how appropriate and inclusive school facilities, curriculum and practices were, \nwe asked participants to rate such provisions at their current or most recent school. The choices were \n‘mostly appropriate’, ‘mostly inappropriate’, or ‘don’t know/not applicable’. Overall, participants indicated \nthat their schools’ provisions were mostly inappropriate. Most striking was the lack of relevant and inclusive \nsexuality education for two-thirds of participants, with less than 10% indicating that their school had a mostly \nappropriate approach. Students at Catholic or other Christian schools were more likely to indicate that their \nsexuality education was mostly inappropriate (85%), and none from this group found it mostly appropriate \n(0%). Puberty education did not fare well either, with over half of all young people reporting it was mostly \ninappropriate. An FTM participant (21yrs) explained: “sex education class did not mention trans or intersex” and \ncharacterised teachers as “mostly intolerant staff”. A gender questioning young person (18yrs) attending an all-\ngirls school noted that allowance for gender diversity was very limited:\nThough the school promotes strength and intelligence in women, we are told to be ‘lady-like’ \n[and] our sex ed was appalling—abstinence was encourage [and] stds were discussed briefly and \nno mention of same sex issues, our bodies are shamed.\nThis is not a surprising situation given that most teachers will be relatively inexperienced with the issues and will \nnot have had training to deal with them. Teaching material relevant to these issues is not currently mandated \nand there are few, if any, resources for teachers to use.\nOver 40% of the young people felt that gender segregation (such as lining up in rows of boys and girls or \nsegregation for learning, etc.) was applied too often at their school. An 18-year-old trans girl/woman said she \nwasn’t ‘out’ at school, but, because it was a very gendered environment, “I was routinely ridiculed for doing \nthings that were considered ‘inappropriate’ for my presumed gender (hanging out with girls instead of boys, \nnot engaging in ‘locker room talk’, being effeminate)”. Younger participants (14 to 17 year olds) seemed to fare \nbetter, with higher numbers indicating that they had mostly appropriate, relevant and inclusive counselling \nservices (or links to such services) at their current or most recent school (67%) compared to 18 to 21 year olds \n(37%), and 22 to 25 year olds (22%). \nParticipants who attended government schools or institutions were also most likely to indicate that these \nprovisions were mostly appropriate for them compared to those from religious schools. A young trans boy/\nman (22yrs) from a religious school commented on the difficulties of contexts where religious and psychological \ncounselling were not separated out: “the only counselling that I knew of in school was from our school \nChaplain, the last person I would feel comfortable talking to about my gender identity”. \nThere can be particular challenges for these students in being able to use the appropriate toilets. For schools, \none of the most important factors is to be sensitive to the students’ need for bathroom facilities that they feel \nare appropriate, private and safe. Over a third of the young people felt that the changing rooms (41%) and \ntoilets (41%) at their current or most recent school were mostly inappropriate. One young person (FTM, 18yrs) \nnoted: “everything was well accepted and catered for at my school, except I was made to use a disabled toilet \ninstead of the male toilets”. Being transgender or gender diverse is not a disability, and while some students will \nchoose this option because it is more comfortable to use a toilet that is ‘unisex’, students should be offered the \nchoice to use whichever toilet they prefer in order to support their physical and mental health needs.\n52\nTheo (transgender, 14yrs, interview participant) explained that while he felt that school was generally “pretty \ngreat” and he had supportive friends, it was hardest in physical education “’cause EVERYTHING is split into \n‘boys’ and ‘girls’, and me and my best friend (who is also transgender) have considered just not going to \nthat class, and my friend always looks really upset”. He was concerned that there were no gender-neutral \nbathrooms, “so I have to avoid going to the loo at school (which SUCKS)”. \nIt is important to note that some of the young people had not declared their gender identity to their school. \nThis reveals the need for schools to provide services on the basis that there will always be gender diverse and \ntransgender students, rather than wait for issues to arise. For one interview participant, Charlotte (24yrs), one \nreason why she maintained silence about her gender identity was due to the perceived effect this may have had \non a family member’s career within education: \nWhen I identified as trans, I was at a Christian school and my mum worked there as a teacher. So \nI always had this fear that if I told one of my friends my secret, it would humiliate and cause my \nmother to lose her job. Unfortunately there were no gay or trans people at my school. At least \nwhom were out. Looking back I should have told somebody.\nOther young people spoke about the highly gendered environment at school and how this influenced their \ndecisions about coming out about their gender in this context; for example, a genderqueer young person \n(24yrs) spoke about remaining quiet due to an “all-boys private school that encouraged a hypermasculine \nenvironment”. Conversely, an FTM student (18yrs) discussed how their senior school environment became \nmore supportive:\nThroughout most of my schooling I was not out and found school very challenging and was \nbullied for not fitting the female social role. From years 7-9 classes were single sex and I found \nthis very uncomfortable. In senior school (10-12) I have been more comfortable with mixed \nclasses. Recently I have socially transitioned, with the school’s permission, and they have been \nmostly accommodating. My classmates have adjusted to the change well and I have a very \nsupportive group of friends.\nThe appropriateness of school uniforms was fairly evenly split. For some young people, the uniform code at \ntheir school was highly gendered; for example, a genderqueer young person (23yrs) described how female staff \nand students were discouraged from wearing trousers and males would be given detention for “wearing ‘girls’ \nuniforms”, and a 16-year old boy described how embarrassed and depressed he felt at being “forced to wear a \ndress/ skirt” at one of his schools. Another young person (FTM, 25yrs) described attending an all-girls private \nschool where the uniforms were feminine and there were no masculine options: “A person who requested \ntrousers at assembly was laughed at and bullied for years. Lesbian/dyke was the worst insult you could be \ncalled.” For other participants, their school offered more flexibility. Cinder (18yrs), who participated in an \ninterview, said: \nMost high schools don’t accept men wearing female uniform and my old school didn’t accept \nfemales wearing men’s uniform (i.e. pants). It makes life hard, because you have to out yourself \nto wear what you want, even when in society its fine to wear pants. Again, having uniform \npolicies that recognise the needs of transgender and gender diverse young people would clearly \nmake a difference to student wellbeing and engagement.\n53\nIMPACTS OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION AT SCHOOL\nBy whether teACherS USeD APProPriAte or iNAPProPriAte lANGUAGe\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%\nMarks Dropped\nCouldn’t concentrate in class\nMissed days\nMissed classes\nHid at recess or lunch\nLeft school altogether\n26%\n22%\n22%\n20%\n26%\n6%\n54%\n54%\n54%\n47%\n44%\n22%\nTeachers used inappropriate language Teachers used appropriate language\n54\nTYPES OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION EXPERIENCED AT SCHOOL\nBy whether teACherS USeD APProPriAte or iNAPProPriAte lANGUAGe\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%\nDiscriminatory language\nSocial exclusion\nDeliberate use of the wrong pronoun\nHumiliation\nWritten abuse\nGraffiti\n28%\n33%\n30%\n28%\n6%\n6%\n66%\n63%\n61%\n56%\n19%\n19%\nTeachers used inappropriate language Teachers used appropriate language\nParticipants whose teachers’ use of pronouns and names were mostly inappropriate were also more likely to \nhave poor educational outcomes than those whose teachers used appropriate language. These educational \noutcomes ranged from being unable to concentrate in class (54% compared to 22%) through to having their \nmarks drop (54% compared to 26%) or leaving school altogether (22% compared to 6%).\nYoung people who told us that respect for their desire for privacy around transgender and gender diverse issues \nand status was mostly inappropriate were more likely to experience all of the types of harassment and abuse \ncompared to young people who felt that respect for their privacy was mostly handled appropriately. These \nexperiences of abuse were related to negative outcomes in many cases; for example, participants who had \nexperienced harassment, discrimination or abuse at school (38% of the total sample) were twice as likely to \nhave PTSD than those who did not (21% compared to 10%). \n55\nRATES OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION EXPERIENCED AT SCHOOL\nBy whether reSPeCt For PArtiCiPANtS’ PriVACy wAS APProPriAte or iNAPProPriAte\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%\nDeliberate use of the wrong pronoun\nDiscriminatory language\nSocial exclusion\nRumours spread about them \nHumiliation\nBullied on social media\nReceived written abuse\nBullied on mobile phones\nGraffiti\n35%\n27%\n33%\n31%\n27%\n12%\n2%\n5%\n2%\n65%\n61%\n59%\n59%\n59%\n41%\n26%\n24%\n22%\nRespect for privacy was inappropriate Respect for privacy was appropriate\n56\nSupportive Classmates\nAnother key protective factor for gender diverse and transgender students was the support of classmates. \nParticipants with supportive classmates were less likely to experience various forms of harassment and \ndiscrimination at school. Overall, 68% per cent of participants without supportive classmates experienced social \nexclusion compared to 30% of those with supportive classmates. Participants without supportive classmates \nwere also more likely to have rumours spread about them (50% compared to 36%). Further, they were more \nlikely to have graffiti written about them (27% compared to 3%); be bullied on social media (47% compared to \n21%); be humiliated (53% compared to 28%); and have people deliberately use the wrong pronoun or name \nto refer to them (50% compared to 26%). Participants without supportive classmates were also more likely to \nmove schools (27% compared to 7% with supportive classmates), miss classes (47% vs. 22%), hide at recess \nor lunch (50% compared to 21%), not use the change rooms (27% compared to 17%) and drop out of extra-\ncurricula activities (27% compared to 14%). \nOne genderqueer young person (21yrs) without supportive classmates told us: “I’d get called dyke, fag, freak, \nshemale, shim. Etc. I’d often have people at school yell ‘are you a guy or a girl?’, when they already knew. They’d \njust be yelling it to be cruel and try and shame me”. Another genderqueer young person (20yrs) explained that \nwithout the intervention of supportive peers, over time the bullying only increased: \nI am routinely called “freak” “tranny” “wrong” “weirdo” “faggot” “poofter”, or hear people in \nthe streets exclaiming “What the fuck?” about me. People stare, appear aggressive or menacing, \nturn and watch or get their friends’ attention about me. High school classmates began seriously \nbullying me and another classmate who had both recently come out as trans women. This \ninvolved abusive language, pictures, statuses making fun of our anatomies and sending us \nhateful messages.\nInclusive Environments\nThese findings point to the vital role that supportive leadership, teachers, and classmates can play in the mental \nand general wellbeing of gender diverse and transgender young people. Further, they suggest the need for \ninclusion of more information on transgender and gender diverse themes in sexuality and puberty education \ncurriculum, and to the need for greater sensitivity to the many ways in which schools can be oppressively \ngendered environments. \nIf whole-of-school supports are put in place, it is possible to create inclusive and respectful educational \nenvironments where young gender diverse and transgender people can thrive and experience protective factors \nfrom further negative wellbeing outcomes. An FTM young person (16yrs) enthused that their school has been \nmostly fantastic with their transition, because “I have had a lot of support from teachers and my peers”. A \n15-year-old transgender young man spoke about the effect that leadership support can have on school culture:\nThe faculty at my school have been pretty great about the whole thing, switching over to the \nnew name and pronouns with only maybe one or two slips as they adjusted. They’re very aware \nof any potential for bullying, which I imagine would be much more appreciated if it was anyone \nother than myself (I don’t know what it is, but my whole school career I have never had a problem \nwith bullying). The students took it surprisingly well. Most of them had never heard the term \ntransgender, so it was mostly just repetitive explaining at a really basic level.\nA school with good connections between teachers and students enabled a more inclusive school environment \nfor one gender-fluid young person (17yrs); they explained:\n57\nI have been lucky enough to attend a small, independent secondary college in Melbourne’s inner-\neast, where the principal and small, tightly knit teaching staff and student community have been \nsupportive and understanding throughout my exploration of my gender identity. I spent 2012 \nmostly identifying as female and preferring the use of a different name and relevant traditional \nfemale pronouns, and found overwhelming warmth and support from my peers, teachers, and \nadministrative staff. I did continue, however, to use the male bathrooms (but never felt uneasy \nabout this at school, though I have in less supportive environments) and gender-segregation was \nrarely an issue as it was not a technique promoted or employed at the school.\nWhen schools support student choices about gendered activities there is a greater sense of inclusion. For \nexample, a gender-fluid young person (16yrs) commented:\nThe only outed transgender person at my school is my best friend. Our school is quite inclusive—\nthey allowed him to play for the boys hockey team and he is allowed to use whatever bathroom \nhe prefers (and they have also given him a key to the staff bathrooms in case he’s not feeling \ncomfortable), but he uses the girls bathroom, probably because he’s afraid to use the male ones. \nOur school is quite brilliant with accepting sexuality. I’m out and very comfortable - I’ve had no \nbullying whatsoever. I can’t say that they’re ‘activists’ at all, but they do support our rights and so \nforth.\nA transgender student (17yrs) highlighted the importance of a whole-of-school approach: \nI am not completely out at my school however I am lucky enough to attend an incredibly \naccepting school. Those of my teachers (including executive staff) who are aware of it are \nincredibly accepting and respect my desire for privacy. Furthermore, when I approached them \nto do some advocacy on Transgender issues on a LGBT activism event (the first at my school) \nthe teachers running it were extremely supportive, as was our acting principal at the time. Their \nconcern was for my safety and that I felt comfortable with the acting principal informing me that \nif I was ever to decide to come out in high school and live openly as transgender she would work \nwith me to make the experience as smooth for me as possible (help with uniforms etc). While my \nschool can be very conservatively Christian it is changing, becoming more tolerant with even the \nlibrary recently buying LGBT-themed books.\nIn Australia, only a few services are currently available to support schools to create more inclusive environments \nfor gender diverse and transgender students. Safe Schools Coalition Victoria (SSCV),funded by the Victorian \nDepartment of Education, was the first statewide service to give specific guidance to schools on supporting \nstudents through the process of gender transition or affirmation, as well as offering professional development \nto school staff on supporting and recognising gender diversity. To date, SSCV has supported 20 students \ntransitioning or affirming gender from as early as grade 2 through to grade 12, with a high degree of success. \nOther state-specific programs aimed at supporting LGBTI communities are provided by organisations such as \nOpen Doors in Queensland, Freedom Centre in Perth and SHine in South Australia, which also provide some \nservices to schools. All these services have a limited capacity and reach, particularly into schools in rural and \nregional Australia and those outside the government system.\nIn June 2014 a new national program ‘Safe Schools Coalition Australia’ was launched to provide services to \nschools to support gender and sexual diversity around the country. Based on the successful Victorian model, \nthe Coalition is hosted by the Foundation for Young Australians with services to be delivered by partners in each \nstate and territory.\n58\nBailey\n16 years old     boy/man \nI am not allowed to wear boy trousers to school. I feel very \nembarrassed and depressed having to wear girl pants to \nschool. I was forced to wear a dress/skirt to school in my \nprevious school.\nI am not allowed to use the male toilet/change room. I wish \nthey have a neutral toilet, but not for disabled people, or \nhave some neutral toilets that include disable people.\nI had to drop one of my favourite subjects, which is sport \nbecause I can’t handle my embarrassment having to \nchange in the female change room. I would really love \nto get involved in many activities that I can represent my \nschool like inter-school sport competition but I am too \nembarrassed as I’ll be force to play in the girl team, or if \nI’m not representing my school for sport competition, then \nother competitions will require myself to dress in full school \nuniform, which I’ll have to wear the girl pants and I hate it.\nThe school principal said he will never call me a male or use \nmale pronoun until I have my gender reassignment therapy \ndone, which will never happen until I [have] left school. \nI also have to wait to be assessed by the gender clinic at \nthe Royal Children Hospital, which doesn’t seem to be in \nprogress, then the school [will] look at the assessment to \ndecide if they will let me wear guy trousers to school or \nnot. I want it to happen right now. It makes me depressed \nso much that a lot of the time I can’t focus at school. \nSometimes I really hate myself for this, and I want to die, or \nto hit myself so hard so that I could faint.\nI tried to suggest for a support group for LGBTQI people at \nmy school, as my school is a big school, so there should be \nmany LGBTQI people. But the principal said it’s not a good \nidea and help no one, nothing.\nTeachers at school still call me a girl and say things like \n“good girl”. I don’t understand which part of me telling them \nI am [not] a girl and all I wanted was to shout out that I am \nnot a girl.\n59\nChapter 8: Abuse and Harassment\n ↗ Sixty-six per cent of participants experienced verbal abuse on the basis of their gender diversity.\n ↗ Twenty-one per cent had experienced physical abuse on the basis of their gender diversity.\n ↗ Thirty-one per cent had experienced other forms of abuse and harassment.\n ↗ The most common location where this abuse took place was the street (40%), closely followed by \nschool (38%).\n ↗ Over 90% of young people who had experienced physical abuse had thought about suicide.\nIt has been well documented that gender diverse and transgender individuals are at greater risk of harassment, \nabuse and discrimination as a result of not conforming to gender norms (E. Lombardi, 2009; E. L. Lombardi, \nWilchins, Priesing, & Malouf, 2001; Stotzer, 2009). Schools and public areas such as public transport have been \npreviously recognised as particularly unsafe spaces for gender diverse and transgender people (L. Hillier et al., \n2010a; Toomey, McGuire, & Russell, 2012). \nVerbal Abuse\nSixty-six per cent (n=112) of participants told us that they had experienced verbal abuse because of their \ngender expression. Ninety-two young people gave us examples of verbal abuse that they have had directed at \nthem, while one told us it was too traumatic for them to repeat. Many had experienced strangers calling out to \nthem in the street, on public transport, and in other public spaces. One gender queer young person (21yrs) told \nus that they are:\nroutinely called “freak” “tranny” “wrong” “weirdo” “faggot” “poofter”, or hear people on the \nstreets exclaiming “What the fuck?” about me. People stare, appear aggressive or menacing, turn \nand watch or get their friends’ attention about me. \nSome participants had experienced verbal abuse from immediate and extended family. One gender questioning \nyoung person (18yrs) was verbally abused by more than one member of their family. \nMy mum said I’d look unattractive at formal, my sister said I’d be a virgin forever and my 5 \n[number changed] aunties and grandma gathered around me and all shouted offensive things at \nme to try and shame me into shaving. \nThis young person continued to tell us that this and other pressure from friends to conform to gender norms \nwas “not exactly bullying or assaulting”. Verbal abuse was also experienced through constant inappropriate \nquestioning about body parts and personal behaviour. One young man (21yrs) experienced this kind of \nharassment and questioning from a co-worker:\nAt work, they would say things such as, “tranny”, “freak”, and a regular “heeeeeey girl”. They also \nbrought up awkward questions and stories, for example “I knew a girl like you in New York. She \nused to pretend she was a boy too, and stand up to pee—do you do that?”\nVerbal abuse also involved strangers whispering to each other and exchanging negative looks in front of the \nyoung people. For some, this kind of public abuse began to reduce when they started ‘passing’ as either a \nyoung man or woman. One trans woman (22yrs) explained: “I’ve gotten better at passing. It has mostly dropped \noff now. Only my voice gives me away, people look shocked and/or disgusted when I speak”. \n60\nPhysical Abuse\nTwenty-one per cent (n=38) of participants told us that they had been physically abused due to their gender \npresentation and 32 young people gave us examples of what they had experienced. For some, it was too \ndistressing or traumatic to be explicit. Several young people told us about experiences of ‘corrective’ rape by \nboth strangers and people known to them. Other physical abuse included being beaten up, pushed, hit, and \ngrabbed. For some of these young people, physical abuse had led to a risk of losing their life. One young woman \n(20yrs) told us that she was “beaten up and thrown on the train tracks because [she] was wearing a skirt”. \nPLACES PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED ABUSE\niNClUDiNG VerBAl, PhySiCAl or other hArrASSmeNt, DiSCrimiNAtioN or ABUSe\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50%\nOn the street (n=73)\nAt school (n=64)\nOn public transport (n=55)\nAt Home (n=43)\nAt a social occasion (n=43)\nAt work (n=17)\nAt a sporting event (n=14)\n32%\n8%\n25%\n38%\n43%\n10%\n25%\nThe most common place to experience verbal or physical abuse was on the street (40%, n=73), closely followed \nby at school (38%, n=64), and on public transport (31%, n=55). One in five young people told us that they \navoided public transport due to feeling unsafe from abuse and harassment. One quarter (25%, n=43) had \nexperienced verbal or physical abuse at home or at a social occasion. One gender queer young person (20yrs) \ndetailed the verbal abuse that they experienced from family:\nMy dad called queer people “fudge packers” and “pillow biters” in front of me, along with stating \nthey weren’t ordinary people, even though I wore a shirt earlier (and showed him the shirt) \nidentifying me as queer. My brother constantly refuses to call me by my preferred name (which is \nactually my legal name now) because I’m “not a girl” as he has frequently reminded me. My sister \nis good with my trans stuff and uses my preferred name and pronouns but my other siblings, and \nother extended family, still call me by my old name.\n61\nPLACES PARTICIPANTS AVOIDED\nDUe to Not CoNFormiNG to GeNDer StereotyPeS\n20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nPublic toilets (n=110)\nChangerooms (n=101)\nShopping centres/clothing stores (n=88)\nClubs/pubs (n=77)\nSocial events (n=76)\nGyms (n=73)\nMedical services (n=49)\nReligious institutions (n=46)\nSchools (n=42)\nPublic transport (n=40)\nRestraurants/bars (n=35)\nPublic spaces (n=35)\nSupermarket/pharmacy (n=32)\nPolice (n=29)\nCultural/community centres (n=24)\nTravelling overseas (n=22)\nLegal services (n=8)\n27%\n52%\n19%\n24%\n29%\n5%\n46%\n17%\n25%\n60%\n21%\n65%\n21%\n43%\n13%\n45%\n14%\nAbuse and discrimination of transgender and gender diverse people can occur because they do not visibly \nconform to strict notions of man/woman, or if they are ‘outed’ or their gender status is known. We asked the \nyoung people to nominate which places and spaces they avoided because of their gender non-conformity. \nParticipants were most likely to tell us that they avoided public toilets (65%, n=110). This is of concern \nconsidering the human need for these facilities and the impact that avoiding such places can have on young \npeople both physiologically and psychologically (when they feel unable to access places such as cinemas). \nUnderstandably, change rooms and shopping centres/clothes store were also places that many of the young \npeople avoided (60%, n=101 and 52%, n=88, respectively). Forty-six per cent (n=77) avoided pubs and clubs. \nGiven that alcohol consumption can be a contributing factor to the occurrence of violence (including race-based \nand gender-based violence), avoiding such places may be a protective measure taken by the young people. \nWhile at first glance it looks encouraging that only 5% (n=8) of the young people avoided legal services because \nof their gender presentation, it is not known if this relatively small number is due to the young age of the \nparticipants and their current lack of requirement for such services. This may also be the case in regard to the \nyoung people avoiding police (17%, n=29).\n62\nImpacts of Abuse\nWhile the correlations between abuse and mental health are explored in greater detail on page 62, it is \nimportant to note that the young people who had experienced physical and/or verbal abuse had a higher \nrisk of suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and forms of self-harm; for example, ninety-two per cent (n=32) of \nthe young people who had experienced physical abuse had thought about suicide due to the discrimination \nand harassment that they had experienced. Further, young people who had not experienced physical or \nverbal abuse told us how they changed their behaviour to avoid abuse. One interview participant, Charlie \n(genderqueer, 20yrs) said, \nI choose to hide my identity because I fear that [abuse]. My family told me that “it’s okay to be a \nlesbian as long as you don’t act like a man”. Thus, the hiding. The fear of discrimination used to \nmake me think that I was wrong, or maybe it still does. \nAddressing Abuse\nSome young people described how they had made statements to the police about their experiences of either \nphysical or verbal abuse, but did not feel as though they were taken seriously or offered any form of protection. \nOne young trans man (20yrs) who sustained a black eye due to being “hit repeatedly at uni [university]” went to \nthe police and made a statement but felt that “not much was done by them”. Tellingly, 17% of the young people \ntold us that they avoided the police due to their gender presentation. \nMuch of the physical, emotional, verbal, sexual and other types of abuse that gender diverse and transgender \nyoung people experience results from rigid stereotypes about gender. Broad-level public health campaigns \ndesigned to positively represent gender diversity may begin to address these issues. Local councils may include \naction plans to decrease violence and discrimination against gender diverse and transgender people in their \ncommunities. Actions may include auditing promotional materials to ensure that there is fair representation of \ngender diverse and transgender people or organising awareness raising activities. Previous research has shown \nthat policy protection in schools can and does make an impact on abuse rates (Jones & Hillier, 2013); similar \ntop-down policy approaches can be applied to the various public spaces (the street, public transport) where \nabuse occurs . \n63\nJasmine\n2O years old     girl / woman \nMy ideal world is where my past, having \nbeen born male, has no implication on my \nlife. That what friends and relationships \nI have either do not have any reason to \nknow, or do know but are able to put that \nin the past and love me for who I am.\nI will have completed my transition, and \nreduced my personal issues with gender \nand self-image from small, to negligible.\nI will be successful in my career and \nhopefully start a family of my own at some \npoint.\nMars\n17 years old     trans* \nI hope that one day me, and those like \nme, will no longer feel shame about our \nidentities.

One day the things we \nhear about kids being kicked out, about \npeople in South Africa, Russia and so \nmany parts of the world being bashed, \nbeing killed for their identity will no longer \noccur. I want to feel I am not an idealist for \nwishing this.\n64\n ↗ The most common mental health condition experienced by participants \nwas stress (48%).\n ↗ 45% had been diagnosed with depression.\n ↗ 38% had thought about suicide.\n65\nChapter 9: Mental health\nCURRENT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%\nStress\nGender Dysphoria\nAnxiety Disorder\nDepression \nSuicidal Thoughts\nGender Identity Disorder\nEating Disorders\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder\nAddictions\nBipolar Disorder \nDissociative Identity Disorder \n40%\n30%\n45%\n47%\n25%\n28%\n10%\n14%\n7.4%\n6%\n3%\n48%\n46%\n44%\n40%\n38%\n33%\n16%\n14%\n11.1%\n11%\n6%\nI think I have My health professional thinks I have\nGender diverse and transgender individuals are more likely to experience mental health conditions than the \ngeneral population (Bradford, Reisner, Honnold, & Xavier, 2012; Conron, Scott, Stowell, & Landers, 2012; \nLenning & Buist, 2013; Jay McNeil, Louis Bailey, Sonja Ellis, James Morton, & Maeve Regan, 2012). Research in \nNew Zealand (Clark et al., 2014) found that gender diverse and transgender young people were four times as \nlikely as the cisgender young people to experience significant depressive symptoms (41% compared to 12%). \n(n=188)\n66\nDespite these high levels of depression, research has also found that amongst transgender and gender diverse \npeople there is a reluctance to seek medical advice and assistance (McNeil et al., 2012). Due to these previous \nfindings, we were interested in exploring whether this was also the case for young people in Australia. In order \nto explore this, we asked the young people to select whether they felt and/or had been told that they had a \nrange of mental health conditions.\nStress\nStress was the most common mental health condition nominated by participants (48%) and the majority of \nthese young people had spoken to a health professional about this (40%). Stress is a broad term that is used \nto describe mental or emotional strain and can be related to particular circumstances such as work-stress, \nunemployment, and minority status, for example. The concept of minority status is useful for examining the \neffects that socio-economic stressors, linked to social bias (such as difficulty finding work or housing), can have \non individuals’ levels of stress (Levitt & Ippolito, 2014). We asked participants if they would like to tell us what \nthey think would improve their mental health and some of the participants mentioned external circumstances \nsuch as “to not be struggling to find housing and work at the very least” (girl/woman, 20yrs). \nAnxiety and depression\nThere was a high rate of anxiety disorders amongst participants with 44% indicating that they felt they had \nanxiety and 45% who had been diagnosed with anxiety. This is much higher than the general Australian \npopulation where on average one in four (25%) Australians will experience anxiety at some point in their \nlifetime (beyondblue). The young people in this research were also more likely to tell us that they had \ndepression than the average for Australian young people aged between 16 and 24 years (which are estimated at \n6-7% in any given year) (Headspace).\nGender Dysphoria and Gender Identity Disorder\nGender Dysphoria, (formally termed Gender Identity Disorder in the DSM IV) is considered to be a psychiatric \ncondition that causes individuals to identify with a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth. \nThe change in terminology in the latest DSM aimed to reduce the viewing of gender diverse and transgender \npeople through a pathological lens and thus decreasing stigmatisation. For young people who are assigned one \nsex and identify with the ‘opposite’ gender, having a diagnosis is a pathway to medical interventions, or, for \nsome, to government-funded medical care. In light of this context, it is not surprising that young people were \nmore likely to tell us that they experienced Gender Dysphoria (46%) or its earlier counterpart, Gender Identity \nDisorder (33%), than they were to tell us that they had a diagnosis from a health professional (27% and 30% \nrespectively). \nThe young people described what gender dysphoria felt like to them in various open-ended survey responses. \nOne young FTM person (17yrs) who, when asked what they thought might improve their mental health, said, \n“I get really bad gender dysphoria, especially given that my body is so curvaceous yet I still have good muscle \nmass. Hopefully surgery and hormones can change that”. Fifteen year old Alex, who participated in an interview \nand described their gender identity as agender, explained the measures that they took to reduce feelings of \ndysphoria including: “It’s awful, I’ve started just labelling things with my last name to avoid first name-related \ndysphoria but even that seems kind of weird, people only see me as female, and I have to wear a very gross, \nvery feminine uniform”. When asked what transitioning meant to them, another young boy/man (21yrs) \ndescribed what gender dysphoria felt like to him:\n67\nPre medical transition, dysphoria was hell; not just insecurity, but panic attacks, deep depression, \nand what I can only describe as a physical feeling that I was not meant to exist in that form. \nSubstance use\n11% of the young people told us that they felt they had addictions and 7% indicated that they had spoken to a \nhealth professional about this. While this is comparable to estimates of addiction among the general population \nof young people in Australia (Lea, de Wit, & Reynolds, 2014), another question in the survey suggests that drug \nand alcohol use may be much higher. We asked participants if they took illegal drugs to help them feel better, \nwith 23% (n=40) telling us that they did. Further, twenty-six per cent (n=45) of the young people told us that \nthey smoked cigarettes and almost half of the young people (48%, n=82) told us that they drank alcohol to help \nthemselves feel better.\nTHOUGHT OF SELF HARM\nSELF HARMED\nTHOUGHT OF SUICIDE \nATTEMPTED SUICIDE\n80%\n70%\n81%\n37%\nSELF HARM AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS\noF yoUNG PeoPle who hAD exPerieNCeD ABUSe, hArrASSemeNt or DiSCrimiNAtioN\nMany studies reveal the alarming rates of suicide and self-harm risks that these populations face, underscoring \nthe urgency of further research into positive strategies required for mental health interventions and social/\ninstitutional provisions (Grant JM et al., 2011). In this current research, we asked participants if they had \nexperienced any of four negative health outcomes (thoughts about self-harm, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, \nand suicide attempts) specifically due to harassment, discrimination, and/or abuse. Only young people who \nhad previously indicated that they had been harassed, discriminated against or abused because of their \ngender identity and/or presentation were asked this question and within the context of these experiences. \nThis means that the young people were asked to think about the link between these negative health outcomes \nand experiences of abuse, discrimination, and harassment. One hundred and twenty-eight participants (68%) \nanswered these questions, all of whom had experienced abuse or harassment of some kind. Only 11% of the \nyoung people who answered this question chose ‘none of the above’, and 1% did not want to answer this \nquestion. \nEighty-one per cent (n=104) of the 128 young people who had experienced abuse and/or discrimination due to \ntheir gender expression had thought about suicide and 37% had made suicide attempts. Eighty per cent of this \nsame cohort had thought about self-harm and 70% had harmed themselves. In a separate question, we asked \nthe young people if they self-harmed in order to feel better. Thirty-six per cent (n=63) of the young people who \nanswered this question told us that they felt at least somewhat better to completely better. Four per cent felt \nabout the same and 11% felt worse. \n(n=128)\n68\nOver fifty young people provided qualitative text about their suicidal thoughts and attempts, and about their \nexperiences of self harming thoughts and behaviours. For some of the young people, these were related to \ntheir struggles with gender identity; for example, one boy/man (19yrs), responded: “What’s to tell, if I could \nhave cut off the offending parts I would have”, and another boy/man (21yrs) told us: “at 13, I tried to stop \nthe feminisation of my chest by burning it with a lighter. I don’t actually classify this as self-harm, because the \naim wasn’t to hurt myself; it was to fix what I perceived as a legitimate physical defect”. Other young people \nexplained that they did not think that their suicidality and self-harm thoughts and behaviours were linked to \ntheir gender identity, one gender-fluid young person (24yrs) for example attributing this to “anxiety and PTSD \n[rather] than distress over my gender identity and expression”.\nOne girl/woman (21yrs) described how family support had made a difference to her suicidality: “I used to think \na lot about suicide, but since my mother and father started supporting me I’ve not thought of suicide in a long \ntime”. While support from family and friends had a positive impact on the young people, non-supportive and \nsometimes abusive parental behaviour increased self-harming thoughts and behaviours, such as in the case of \none gender-queer young person (23yrs) who explained the emotional and verbal abuse that they experienced \nfrom their family:\nI experienced very severe emotional abuse at home, including my father suggesting I should kill \nmyself if things got too hard. During these times I was very suicidal, and often had the urge to \nself-harm, especially to cut myself, although another part of me didn’t want to and I didn’t. I used \nto hit myself though. There was sometimes a queerphobic undertone to my father’s emotional \nabuse.\nFor other young people, suicidality and self-harm thoughts and behaviours were linked to a desire for social \nand/or medical transition. One young FTM (16yrs) for instance explained that he had “attempted suicide the \nfirst time when I was 12, and have felt suicidal on and off for the years since. I have been a bit better recently, \nsince I have fully transitioned socially”. Another young trans man who participated in an interview, Kenny, \n(22yrs) explained how thoughts about society and broader political trends affected how he felt about the \nfuture:\nMore so during high school days, I’ve done a lot in the past few years that has developed me \ninto a resilient adult and it takes a lot more to bring me down to feel suicidal but sometimes it \nhappens when I see no options about how society is going to improve when we have capitalist \ngovernments, fascists and religious bigots in the world and Aus. \n69\nBohdi\n22 years old     Boy / man \nI liked cutting myself because it fulfilled a lot of needs \nI have. For instance, my lowest, most distressing \nmoods move on very quickly and it can be difficult \nto understand that it’s only been a few hours since I \nfelt so bad I wanted to kill myself - a cut on my arm \nwould take a week or more to heal, and would be a \nreminder that this was part of my experience. It was a \nsocial badge to communicate the situation I was in. It \nmade me feel like I had control over my will, and that I \nwas powerful. Finally, in the initial painful cut and bolt \nof brain chemicals in response, it cleared my head of \nmuggy upset feelings (which were often clouding my \nability to think even further than “I want to die” and \nlying on the ground) and allowed me to reconnect \nwith reality, recover, and get on with my life. I have \nstopped self-harming, though, in order to move my \ntransition on easier. Since I always made the decision \nto do it, and made sure I had good reason to, it wasn’t \na problem to simply make the decision not to do it - \nit’s just a bit harder to get through things, and I miss it.\n70\n71\nChapter 1O: Mental health professionals\n ↗ 66% of the young people had seen a health professional for their mental health in the twelve \nmonths prior to taking the survey.\n ↗ 60% of these same young people were satisfied overall with their mental health care experiences \nin the previous twelve months.\n ↗ 30% of the participants had chosen not see a mental health professional at some point due to a \npast negative experience.\nAs is evident from the high rates of mental health conditions and self-harming behaviours explored in the \nprevious chapter, young people’s access to mental health professionals is crucial for keeping them well and \nalive; however, the discrimination and lack of knowledge about gender diversity and transgender issues that \nexists in the broader community can also be seen in health care settings creating a barrier for young people. \nPrevious research has shown that factors such as transphobia, lack of knowledge about gender diverse and \ntransgender young people, and a lack of institutional policies about appropriateness in health care settings, are \nbarriers for gender diverse and transgender people accessing health care (Snelgrove, Jasudavisius, Rowe, Head, \n& Bauer, 2012). In order to explore this, we asked the young people about their experiences of mental health \ncare in Australia and what constituted appropriate and inappropriate care for them. \nSatisfaction and engagement with mental health professionals\nSixty-six per cent (n=123) of the young people had seen a health professional for their mental health in \nthe twelve months prior to completing the survey. This is higher than the estimated percentage in the \ngeneral population (30%) who seek professional help for mental health issues in any given year (Australian \nGovernment). This result may be skewed, however, due to regulations in many states and territories stipulating \nthat individuals seeking medical interventions, such as hormones or surgery, require a diagnosis of gender \ndysphoria before access is granted.\nOf the 123 young people who had seen a mental health professional in the previous twelve months, 60% told us \nthat they were either mostly satisfied or very satisfied with their experiences, while a further 17% were neither \nsatisfied nor unsatisfied. Fifteen per cent of the young people were dissatisfied overall or very dissatisfied with \ntheir experiences with mental health professionals in the previous twelve months; however, it needs to be \nnoted that what constitutes a satisfactory experience for one individual may be unsatisfactory for another; for \nexample, an individual may feel that the experience was satisfactory because they received what they sought \nfrom the mental health professional (i.e. medication, or approval for hormones), whereas another individual \nmay feel dissatisfied with the experience due to the way that the health professional responded to them. \nIdeal Interactions\nThe young people told us that they had had better mental health care experiences when the professional \nwas knowledgeable about gender diverse and transgender health care. One genderqueer young person \n(20yrs) explained that they felt lucky because they had found a “wonderful psychologist who is a passionate \nfeminist and is very empathetic and also extremely knowledgeable on gender and/or sexuality issues”. Another \ngenderqueer young person (23yrs) told us how their university provided access to a “queer counsellor” and \nthat, “it is the first time I have ever had queer-specific mental health services accessible to me, and I am \nfinding them very helpful” (genderqueer, 23yrs). For another young person (18yrs), having a therapist who \n72\nis “understanding, accepting, competent and helpful” stood out from other mental health professionals who \nmay only focus on the mental condition instead of on the whole person. For this same young person their \n“depression was diagnosed and treated effectively” but the “experience or knowledge” was lacking.\nFor young people who identify as gender diverse, finding health professionals who are aware of, accepting, and \nknowledgeable about the dynamic spectrum of gender identities may be even more difficult; however, given \nthe rise in rates of young people who are identifying with these diverse genders, it is important that health \nprofessionals are equipped to provide health care that takes into account each individual’s gender identity(ies) \n(Bockting, Robinson, Benner, & Scheltema, 2004). The lack of understanding about this diversity is illustrated in \nthe following quote from a survey participant:\nI briefly visited [organisation’s name removed] to discuss my feelings regarding my gender, \nand to explore the relevance of a Gender Identity Disorder diagnosis. Whilst helpful, I found \nthe particular psychiatrist I was seen by not terribly well-versed in the diversity of transgender \nidentity - with surprise and a sense of intrigue he declared “you don’t seem really like you have \nGID (i.e. you don’t 100% strongly and consistently identify with the gender opposite to your sex \nat birth), it’s sort of like you’re gender-bisexual!” He did, however, attempt to link me in with an \nLGBTI support group and offered otherwise good advice.\nEducating the Professional\nYoung gender diverse and transgender people often find themselves in the position of educating the health \nprofessional; this was raised by many of the young people in this research. One Brotherboy (20yrs) told us that \n“for the most part I felt as if I were educating them on the issue”. Sometimes a mental health professional’s lack \nof knowledge resulted in them asking questions that were deemed to be inappropriately curious or dismissive \nof what the young person was telling them. One androgynous young person (16yrs) described an experience in \nwhich the health professional “didn’t seem to know what they were doing, had never heard of non-binary sex, \nand kept doubting what I said”. \nHowever, when this lack of knowledge was recognised by the health professional who could then direct the \nyoung person to someone more suitable, the young person was likely to feel respected and acknowledged, as \none young trans boy/man (22yrs) explained:\nWhile the counsellor I initially saw admitted that transgender identity wasn’t an area she was \nfamiliar with she gave me contact information for a GP who she knew could help me. I have a lot \nof respect for this counsellor as I’d rather someone admit they don’t know enough and send me \nto someone who can help.\nWhile an obvious way forward would be to include gender diversity and transgender training for medical and \nother health professional students, having a specialist service for gender diverse and transgender mental health \ncare needs may help to fill this gap in the interim. As one young trans man (22yrs) told us: “there needs to be \nspecialist counselling for trans people … and for intersex and Aboriginal Sistergirls”.\n73\nAvoiding mental health professionals\nWhile a large percentage of the young people had seen a mental health professional in the previous twelve \nmonths (66%), in response to another question only 13% (n=23) of the total sample told us that they always \nsought mental health assistance from health professionals, while 10% (n=15) said that they had never had \nmental health issues. The remaining 77% of participants nominated at least one reason for not consulting \nhealth professionals about their mental health in the past. Many young people felt that a health professional \nwouldn’t be able to do anything for them (35%, n=61) and that they wouldn’t be understood (33%, n=57). \nOne trans* young person (25yrs) explained that they have avoided health professionals because “they \nwill discriminate against me and it will make me very upset”. Rather than seeking professional help, a few \nparticipants told us that they could ‘fix’ themselves, such as one agender young person (25yrs) who said, “I \nbelieve [in] personal accountability and as such have not sought diagnosis”. \nAnother trans* participant (22yrs) explained: “I know what’s wrong with me and I know what would fix it. I will \nfix it myself because they can’t understand exactly”. Parents were also an obstruction to professional mental \nhealth care for many of the participants. Twenty-eight per cent (n=44) indicated that they had avoided seeking \nprofessional help for mental health issues due to their concern that their parents would find out. For one 16 \nyear old, their parent denied them the money to seek professional help because they did not think that they \nwere in need of it, while another 16 year old told us that their parents “have blocked me from seeing a HP \n[health professional] at all for the past few years”. \nThirty percent (n=53) of all participants indicated that negative past experiences with health professionals had \nprevented them from seeking mental health care. This may account for some of the 34% (n=65) of participants \nwho had not seen a mental health professional in the previous twelve months. The young people described \nnegative experiences that they had had with mental health professionals which included: the language that they \nREASONS FOR NOT SEEING A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL\n10% 20% 30% 40%\nThere isn’t anything they could do for me\nThey won't understand me\nFinancial reasons\nNegative past experiences\nWorried parents/carers would find out\nThe language they use makes me uncomfortable/angry\nThey won't believe me\nDistance\nWorried school will find out\nWill affect my approvals\nWorried work will find out\n11%\n32%\n9%\n13%\n30%\n9%\n33%\n35%\n6%\n23%\n28%\n(n=188)\n74\nused, not feeling validated or listened to, and deliberately and consistently being misgendered (i.e. the use of \nthe wrong pronoun or name). \nTwenty-three per cent (n=43) of the young people indicated that the language that health professionals used to \ndescribe them made them feel uncomfortable or angry; for example, a 14 year old, genderqueer young person \nfelt uncomfortable when health professionals would trivialise their concerns by saying things like, “it’s probably \njust ‘girly’ problems you [will] grow out of it, it just make[s] me feel uncomfortable’. Another genderqueer young \nperson (23yrs) described three separate encounters where their consent, confidentiality, and autonomy to \nexplain their gender in their own way was denied or abused:  \nThe first doctor I made mention of my gender identity to, locked me in her office alone and left \nto consult with every other doctor in the surgery about what to do without my consent, my GP \nbrought up my gender identity in front of my mother without having ever spoken to me about it \n(and not knowing if I had ever spoken to her about it) and a psychologist told me that there was \nno such thing as a non-binary identity and I was either just a tomboy or possibly a transman, but \nonly if I had been born in some way intersex.\nOne trans girl/woman (21yrs) described an experience where a health professional was insisting on fitting this \nyoung woman’s experiences into a framework of past childhood trauma:\nPsychiatrist that cost nearly $150 and 5 minutes in he said he didn’t believe in trans problems and \nthat they most likely stemmed from childhood trauma. That was the most awkward thing I’ve \never dealt with as he kept trying to convince me something happened in childhood (it didn’t) and I \nnever went back.\nThe financial cost of mental health professionals was prohibitive for almost a third of the young people \n(32%, n=32). As one young boy/man (24yrs) commented: “mental health professionals especially—they are \noverpriced. I feel like they don’t actually care or want to help you, they just have to sit there for an hour to get \n$200 from you. It feels like a slap in the face when you see their BMWs parked out the front”.\nNegative Experiences\nFifty-three per cent of participants had had a negative experience with a health professional during their \nlifetime. The flow-on effects of these experiences included: 22% (n=42) avoiding health professionals for a \nwhile, and another 11% (n=20) choosing not to see health professionals at all. Only 6% (n=11) of all participants \ntold us that they had made a complaint. Of those who did complain, the outcome was not always desirable, \nsuch as in the case of one young boy/man (20yrs) who explained that, in response to his complaint, “they raised \ntheir voice at me and blamed it on me”. After a lack of action following their complaint, a MTF young person \ntold us that this was “extremely disempowering and disturbing” and that they “deeply regret ever dealing with \nthem”. \nOnly half of the young people (n=91) stopped seeing that particular health professional after a negative \nexperience, leaving 50% who did not choose this response. Eleven per cent (n=21) chose not to complain for \nfear that it would affect their approval for medical transition procedures and/or hormones. One young man/boy \n(15yrs) explained: “I bit my tongue, because it’s the frigging coordinator of my medical transition”. He went on \nto tell us, however, that due to this person’s unprofessional manner, and the fact that other gender diverse and \ntransgender young people see this particular health professional, next time he would try to say something:\n75\n[I] made a promise to myself that I would correct her next time it happened, because messing up \nmy pronouns and gender, and just failing to grasp any of the problems a transgender teenager \nmight experience is pretty bad when it’s what I’m there to see her for, and what if she treats \nanother kid? So I’m going to correct her next time she stuffs up, bugger the approvals (the other \ndocs like me, anyway). \nChloe\n18 years old     Girl / woman \nThe first time I saw my current psychiatrist about \ngender dysphoria, I felt like I was being attacked by \nhim. He was asking intrusive, pointed questions in \nirrelevant areas (mostly about crossdressing; I’ve never \ndone it), and even when I told him I didn’t see how \nthey were relevant, he kept asking. I felt like with some \nof his questions he was trying to evaluate how much \nI sounded like a stereotypical sexist idea of a woman \nand use that to see whether I deserved treatment or \nnot.\nI didn’t complain because I had so much trouble \ngetting a single appointment that it seemed like \nI didn’t have the option of going elsewhere. If I \ncomplained, or said anything he didn’t like really, he \nhad the power to deny me treatment and then I would \nhave had to find another way to get treatment. It \nwould have been possible, but difficult. \nSo I stayed quiet and came back for a second \nappointment, which was luckily much better. The \nsecond time he was much less confrontational, and \nactually asked relevant and useful questions.\nThe fact that it has been this difficult to get to the \npoint of even being able to get HRT is ridiculous, \nand my experience with this particular professional \nis a lucky one according to many trans people. I’m \nset to get HRT as soon as the 3-month-period is up. \nSome people report much longer times. This truly \nis a horrendous situation, that my frankly dismal \nexperience is relatively good in comparison.\n76\n77\nChapter 11: Protective factors, activism,  \nand knowledge\n ↗ Young people with supportive parents fared better on a range of indicators, including better \nmental health and access to mental health professionals.\n ↗ 1 in 3 participants did not feel supported by their family.\n ↗ 62% of young people told us that they became involved in activism to help them feel better.\n ↗ 98% of participants found websites to be an important source of information.\nFeeling Better\nThis research has supported and built upon previous research by looking at the experiences of abuse and \ndiscrimination, high rates of mental illness, suicidality and self-harm in the gender diverse and transgender \ncommunities. To add to this data, we went further in also investigating how young people personally employed \nstrategies to lift themselves up when they were feeling down. To do so, we asked them to indicate which \nactivities made them feel better, and which made them feel worse. Finding ways to deal with emotions as they \nwere happening was important for many participants. Music, for example, was nominated as a useful way to \nshift thoughts/feelings or express them. Ninety per cent (n=161) of the 180 young people who answered this \nquestion told us that they felt at least a bit better after listening to music. One trans* young person (25yrs) \nexplained: “listening to music helps me let out my emotions, so first I might be more down, but then I am more \nup” and a transgender woman (21yrs) explained: “fast quick happy music also helps cheer me up if I’m feeling \nbad for some reason”. \nSpending time with friends helped 77% (n=134) of the participants to feel better, with many of the young \npeople describing how having supportive people in their lives reminded them that they were loved and \nworthwhile. One young boy/man (17yrs) told us how “supportive friends who know everything” about him help \nhim to see that he “shouldn’t be feeling down about something because it’s just a little bit silly”. A genderqueer \nyoung person (20yrs) explained how friends helped to make them feel loved and valued, in turn helping to \nnegate the effects of abuse and harassment:\nBeing around those who are positive influences in my life, my chosen family so to speak, makes \nme feel a lot better. Just because a drunk, cisgendered, male wants to beat my head in with his \nfist, does not mean I deserve this. Friends, art, and various other things remind me that I am \nvalid, even if my gender is very much grey.\n78\nSpend time with friends\nChat with friends online\nText or call friends\nChat with a health professional\nParticipate in online forums\nSpend time with family\nOnline support groups\nOffline support groups\nEngage a gender service\nTalk to a teacher\nSOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND PEOPLE ENGAGED TO FEEL BETTER \nAND the imPACt oN PArtiCiPANtS\nFelt better Felt worseFelt the same Don’t do this\n70% 6% 4% 20%\n23%2%\n5%\n6%\n28%\n3%\n3%\n1%\n3%\n9%\n14%\n19%\n12%\n9%\n7%\n3%\n3%\n66%\n45%\n37%\n37%\n36%\n30%\n15%\n10%\n36%\n38%\n23%\n52%\n60%\n81%\n84%\n76% 8% 3% 13%\n(n=189)\n79\nListen to music\nCreate art\nSpend time with pets\nRead a book\nExercise\nEat\nPlay video games\nWatch TV\nStudy\nPlay sport\nRECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES ENGAGED TO FEEL BETTER  \nAND the imPACt oN PArtiCiPANtS\nFelt better Felt worseFelt the same Don’t do this\n88%\n70%\n63%\n58%\n57%\n55%\n52%\n44%\n25%\n21%\n7%\n2%\n4%\n13%\n6%\n18%\n14%\n22%\n12%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n2%\n6%\n10%\n1%\n7%\n15%\n4%\n3%\n27%\n27%\n33%\n31%\n17%\n33%\n27%\n33%\n72%\n(n=189)\n80\nPhysically harm body\nSeek sexual experiences\nDrink alcohol\nTake illegal drugs\nSmoke cigarettes\nOTHER ACTIVITIES ENGAGED TO FEEL BETTER  \nAND the imPACt oN PArtiCiPANtS\nFelt better Felt worseFelt the same Don’t do this\n37%\n34%\n28%\n20%\n17%\n4%\n6%\n9%\n2%\n6%\n11%\n10%\n13%\n4%\n3%\n48%\n50%\n50%\n74%\n74%\n(n=189)\n81\nLEVELS OF FAMILY SUPPORT\noF PArtiCiPANtS who iDeNtiFieD with hAViNG DePreSSioN\nParents and Families\nParents and families play a vital role in fostering the wellbeing of gender diverse and transgender young people \n(Lindner, 2014). Family rejection has been found to increase the risk of suicide and poor mental health of \nthese young people (Arnold H. Grossman, D’Augelli, Howell, & Hubbard, 2005). Parents and carers may also be \nverbally or physical abusive, or ignore, or disengage from their gender diverse and transgender children (Grant \net al., 2011). While information, support groups and resources for parents with gender diverse or transgender \nchildren are available (for example, Transcend, transfamily, Families like mine, True colours, and FTM Australia, \namongst others),  the degree to which gender stereotypes and norms are embedded at familial, societal and \ninstitutional levels can contribute to parents’ reactions, disengagement and abuse (Arnold H. Grossman et al., \n2005). It is also worth noting that the stress or discrimination experienced by gender diverse and transgender \nyoung people may not be shared by their families, and therefore be potentially harder for them to understand \n(e.g. compared to racism which may be experienced by multiple members of a family).\nParental support was a clear protective factor for the young people in this research. Young people who told \nus that their parents or carers were supportive (63%, n=116, of all young people) fared better on a number \nof indicators than the young people who did not feel that their parents were supportive (33%, n=60); for \nexample, young people who had parental support were half as likely to tell us that they had suicidal thoughts \n(30% compared to 58%), and were twice as likely to see a health professional if they did have suicidal thoughts \n(32% compared to 16%). Young people who did not feel supported by their parents or carers were twice as \nlikely to feel that they had depression compared to the young people who felt supported by their families (60% \ncompared to 30%). Unsurprisingly, young people who did not feel supported by their parent or carers were \nmore likely to have experienced harassment or abuse in the home (40% compared to 15%). One young boy/\nman (18yrs) explained: “my parents are not supportive and have told me that I’m no longer part of the family”; \nand a 14 year old trans girl/woman explained that her father “tries to say my feelings don’t exist and insist it’s \nsomething coming from past abuse”.  \nOne genderqueer young person (22yrs) told us about the support that they receive from their father. The \npicture that they paint stands in direct contrast with many of the distressing experiences that some of the other \nyoung people have had:\nThere’s a forest right near my house where I walk and I like to go with my dad to vent. Being able \nto talk to him and being in such a nice place always helps.\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\nFeel supported by family\nDo not feel supported by family 60%\n33%\n82\nActivism\nPrevious research has found that transgender and gender diverse young people are more likely to be involved \nin activism (27%) than their cisgender same-sex attracted peers (12%) (L. Hillier et al., 2010b). One possible \nreason for this increased engagement in activism may be the higher levels of marginalisation and discrimination \nthat these young people face (Jones & Hillier, 2013). The majority (91%, n=172) of participants in this current \nresearch had taken part in at least one activism activity. Sixty-two per cent explained that they became involved \nin activism because it was a means of being heard and of feeling better. One transgender young person (23yrs) \ntold us: “I feel proactive, and that my voice is valued and worthwhile”. A 17 year explained that activism made \nthem feel like they were contributing to the state of the world and that this had a positive effect on how they \nfelt about themselves:\nI feel as though engaging in a positive action, something that adds to the world, lifts my spirits \ngreatly and allows me to feel like a stronger and a better person.\nOver half of the young people indicated that they felt better about their gender identity (60%, n=114) when \nthey participated in activism. Further, they had fun (57%, n=108), and it made them feel part of a community \n(55%, n=104). The participants were most likely to have ‘liked’ a Facebook page or other social media site (83%, \nn=139), signed a petition (80%, n=149), improved understanding through conversation (70%, n=123), or been \npart of a march or rally (52%, n=93). Significant numbers had even spoken at a march/rally (10%, n=18), or \ncontributed to the organisation of a march/rally (9%, n=15). Nearly 30% (n=51) had created a blog, 20% (n=34) \nhad uploaded a video to the Internet, and 22% (n=38) had written to a local member of parliament.\nYoung people gave a vast range of reasons for engaging in activism, many of which were related to an \nunderstanding that gender diverse and transgender young people need and want many improvements to \nsociety. In this way, for some, activism was seen as a responsibility. One young boy/man (21yrs) said that, for \nhim, “activism is the rent I pay for living on Earth”. Another young boy/man (20yrs) spoke about the tension he \nfelt between knowing the importance of activism and just wanting to be a regular guy:\nI’m in a strange state where I want nothing to do with the activism side―I’m happy to be a \nstealth, regular guy. But on the other hand, I have a deeply felt rage and sadness about the state \nof things, and a feeling of social responsibility to look after people who are marginalised in the \nsame ways as I have been, and to improve things for them if I can. They seem to be mutually \nexclusive options―activism or stealth. One I hate because it means I can’t just live as a normal \nguy―I always have to be ‘trans’, and I hate that. The other I hate because it means turning my \nback on people who really do need all the help they can get, when I’m in a position to really help \nchange things.\nWhile some of the young people told us that activism helped them to feel a part of a community, other young \npeople expressed discontentment and frustration in relation to a lack of understanding of gender diversity \nwithin the gay, lesbian and bisexual, or queer community.\nI don’t like being involved with the queer community. They’re not really like me and they can be \nreally stupid and insensitive sometimes. I just don’t get along with them, and generally try to \navoid them. Also rainbows are garish and childish (Boy/Man, 22yrs).\nI’ve started an arts group for transgender people, which was nice.

It actually makes me feel worse because it means having the current legal status \nof that community thrown in my face on a day to day basis, and because even in the unlikely \ncircumstance we manage to get the law changed, there’s still a hell of a lot more that needs to be \ndone (Boy/Man, 21yrs).  \nI find creating art/writing and participating in loud, angry, activism extremely cathartic in the \n84\nshort term though slightly disheartening in the long term because I know I’m not being listened to \nby the people who need to hear most (Genderqueer, 23yrs).\nInformation sources\nMarginalised individuals can often be disconnected from peer support and education relating to their particular \nneeds. The Internet has helped to correct the invisibility and isolation that many groups feel, including groups \nof transgender and gender diverse young people. More than just a virtual space, the Internet is also a conduit \nfor real-time and face-to-face support and connection in a world that can be hostile to young people who do \nnot fit societal gender-norms. Along with the young people’s use of the Internet as a source of information and \nconnection, we were also interested in understanding where, what, and how young transgender and gender-\ndiverse people gained information about the many aspects of gender identity. This information is useful for \nsupport groups, community services and others in increasing their reach to this population. \nWe provided the young people with a list of possible places that they could learn about gender(s), transgender \nand gender diverse issues and asked them to tell us how important these sources were for them. Almost all \n(98%, n=167) found websites important, with blogs (88%, n=147), YouTube (87%, n=145) and social media \n(83%, n=137) also important sources for many of the young people. Research as a source of information and \nknowledge was nominated by 91% (n=149) of the young people and was a surprising result; however, research \nmay be their way of finding out about medical transition and medical technologies. One young man (21yrs) \nexplained: “Research―I keep an eye on for technological medical advances in the field of surgery, given that I \nplan on having that when it is improved to an acceptable level”. Furthermore, social research may be used for \nactivist efforts with schools and governments by the young people, while research such as this study provides \naccess to the voices of young people, allowing them to learn through hearing other people’s stories and \nexperiences. \nSeventy-seven per cent (n=124) of the young people found their peers to be a good source of information and \nalso a support in knowing that they are not alone in many of their experiences. One young transwoman told us \nthat: “websites and support groups have been good, but the major thing is other people in similar positions, it \nis really helpful hearing other people feeling similar”. This MTF young person (24yrs) also felt that other people \nwere a great source of information: “most of the advice I find most important comes directly from transgender \nand gender diverse people or from people that I am close to”. \nOther recent Australian research with same-sex attracted and gender diverse young people also found that, \nwhile the Internet was a great source of information and support, face-to-face support from peers was more \neffective in reducing feelings of isolation (Robinson et al., 2014). In this way, support for services that connect \nyoung people to each other and provide access to trained peer support for transgender and gender diverse \nyoung people needs to be fostered. While it is clear that the Internet plays a vital role in young people’s access \nto information, face-to-face support and opportunities for friendship reduce the risk of isolation. The Internet \ndoes however offer an opportunity to be anonymous, and this can provide safety for some young people, such \nas for one agender/no gender young person (18yrs) who explained: “I just find [the] majority of my info and \nsupport online, just because it’s easier, safer, and broader”. \nYouTube and Tumblr were both mentioned multiple times in the open-ended data. Tumblr (a social networking \nblog site) was mentioned as a place where transgender and gender diverse experiences, issues and solutions \nwere shared; for example, one androgynous young person (17yrs) explained how Tumblr provided inspiration \nfor learning more: “I joined Tumblr and due to many of the members’ acceptance and knowledge of sexuality \n85\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION\nPArtiCiPANtS FoUND to Be imPortANt\n20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nWebsites\nResearch\nBlogs\nYouTube\nSocial media\nPeers\nQueer media\nBooks (non-fiction)\nFilms\nSupport groups\nHealth professionals\nBooks (fiction)\nGender centres\nMagazines \n63%\n88%\n37%\n57%\n71%\n87%\n32%\n63%\n91%\n50%\n98%\n55%\n77%\n83%\nand gender I was inspired to begin researching and understanding”. A genderqueer young person (22yrs) found \nthat the blogs on Tumblr offered perspectives that were more diverse than the typical narrative presented in \nqueer and mainstream media:\nI pretty exclusively use Tumblr for info about and from the trans* community now. Mainstream \n& even queer media is dull because they just rehash the same info about trans* people and the \nsame tired ‘trans* narratives’ over and over again. That media isn’t for trans* people; it’s for \neveryone else to learn about trans* people and it’s boring. I seek out trans* bloggers for their \nperspectives and to continue to learn more about my community and about how it intersects with \nother communities.\nOver half (57%, n=95) of the young people who answered this question found support services to be important \nsources of information for them. There are many national and state-based support services and organisations \navailable to gender diverse and transgender young people, and many of the participants explained how these \nare vital to their wellbeing. In response to a question asking them to name an organisation or support service \nthat they found particularly helpful, 126 participants mentioned at least one, with many naming multiple \norganisations, support groups and online communities.\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2 of this report, the young people were mainly recruited through online and offline \nsupport groups and organisations. The fact that so many of the young people could name at least one \n86\norganisation may be representative of this recruitment bias. Organisations such as Ygender (n=21), Headspace \n(n=13) and The Freedom Centre (n=11) were mentioned multiple times along with other organisations such as \nThe Gender Centre and Minus18. The Northside Clinic was the only health service mentioned and that was by \nfive young people. Other organisations that the young people found helpful include Twenty Ten, beyondblue, A \nGender Agender and FTM Australia. Youth services and drop-in centres were useful for the young people as well \nas local community centres and LGBTIQ teen support groups. Other young people mentioned individual people \nsuch as their psychologist or a family member. \nSupporting the finding detailed above, many of the participants reiterated the need for face-to-face contact, \nemphasising the role that these support services and online communities can play in fostering community that \nspreads into friendship and families-of-choice. One androgynous young person (17yrs) explained: \nMinus18 events give me a sense of community, so do the friends I have made on tumblr (and \noften meet irl [in real life]). They also both give me friends which is another comfort in itself. \nAnother young person (genderqueer, 23yrs) also mentioned how these services can reduce feelings of isolation: \n“Ygender, just because it exists and makes me feel less alone”. \nServices that offer immediate mental health support were also mentioned, not surprising given the high rates \nof mental health and self-harm behaviours experienced by these young people. One no gender/agender young \nperson (16yrs) said, “Lifeline Chat service is great, but I wish it were 24 hours. Sometimes I really need to talk \nto someone who’s trained”. Institution-specific organisations, groups and services were also mentioned such as \nschool counsellors, queer groups, and queer rooms on university campuses. \nThe variety of both online and offline groups and services mentioned by the young people points to the \nmulti-levels of support that they require. Crisis lines, community-building events such as Minus18’s events, \ninclusive health services where young people know they are welcome and safe, such as the Drummond Street \nHealth Clinic in Victoria, and supportive individual psychologists were all nominated as particularly good and \nsupportive when they worked well for the young person. Specific YouTube channels were mentioned along with \nTumblr communities and websites that the young people found vital at different points (for example, Laura’s \nPlayground was mentioned as a particularly useful website by a few participants). For young people who lived in \nrural areas, community centres and support groups in their towns were important, along with the anonymity of \nonline communities. One interview participant, Charlotte (transwoman, 21yrs), explained the effect on her on a \npersonal level of engaging with gender diverse and transgender inclusive support services:\nYes, they’ve been immensely helpful, supportive and wonderful. They are the first people to \naddress me as ‘her’ and ‘she’. It was a surprise and initially the warmth, love and openness \ndefinitely had a profoundly euphoric effect on me.\n87\nCasey\n18 years old     Girl / woman \nI came to accept myself as a transgender woman \nthrough reading a lot of web sites and blogs, and \nwatching a few youtube videos on the subject. This \nis where the majority of my education on the overall \nissues and theory of transgender people’s existence \ncame from.\nThe practical aspects of transition were explained to \nme mostly by the internet, but support groups and \nthe people in them certainly helped me.\nHealth professionals knew less than I did by the time I \ngot to them, but some of them were able to help with \nexplaining the hoops I have to jump through to get \nHRT and surgery.\nOngoing battles for trans equality are important to \nme, even if I’m not being actively involved with them, \nwhich is where queer media come in.\nBooks are mostly unimportant to me, because there is \nso much amazing trans theory and other information \nonline. Books are a setting where discussion and \nmultiple voices are less viable and suitable than the \ninternet. Having one voice privileged enough to get a \nbook deal talk for a few hundred pages is less valuable \nthan a few shorter articles by many different people \nfrom different backgrounds. There is such diversity \nin the trans community that it seems like listening to \none person for an entire book is almost pointless. I’ve \nfound that there aren’t many (if any) concepts that \ntruly require an entire book to comprehend. Worst of \nall, it seems that many books are just aggregations of \ntrans theory from online. So, I’m comfortable ditching \nbooks for the most part.\n88\nChapter 12: Conclusions and \nrecommendations\nMany gender diverse and transgender young people described their lives to us, explained what they would \nlike them to be, and told us how they would like to live them, detailing steps that they are taking to do so; for \nexample, through activism, peer-support, and knowledge sharing. The findings from their participation tell \na story of a group of young people who often disrupt more generic understandings of “transgender” labels \nand gender-based notions of “sexual orientations”. They came to these identity positions in different ways \nand at different points, and have thus far mainly privileged social methods of gender transition over medical \nones. Their experiences were rarely reflected in the puberty and sexuality educations provided by schools, but \nwere made qualitatively better by any structural and social supports from leadership and teachers that were \nin place. Too many had experienced verbal or physical abuse that was linked to suicide risk, depression and \nother conditions and with such vulnerabilities in play, negative experiences with health professionals were an \nunfortunate occurrence leading many young people to avoid health care professionals. Parental support was a \nprotective factor for their wellbeing, as was a range of engagements with even the most basic forms of activism. \nThese young people were not mere victims, but showed themselves as agents of change within themselves \nand other people. They had much to give both themselves and others through their work promoting non-\ndiscrimination and inclusion, whether they did so online or in-person, alone or in groups.\nThe following recommendations to governments, schools, support services and organisations, and health \nprofessionals are aimed at supporting and fostering the resilience and mental and general wellbeing of these \nyoung people by creating safe and inclusive environments that also facilitate the activism work that they are \nalready undertaking and in which they aspire to further engage. \nState and federal governments\n ↗ To implement federal sex and gender guidelines across all departments and all states and \nterritories with adequate training for staff.\n ↗ To adopt the federal definition of gender identity across states and territories, for consistency.\n ↗ To create uniformity across states and territories in legislation relating to Birth Certificates and \nother legal documentation.\n ↗ To increase funding for vital resources and services for gender diverse and transgender young \npeople.\n ↗ To provide consistent policy and guidance (that does not include any religious exemption) for \nschools across all sectors to support gender diverse and transgender students. \nMental health professionals and services\n ↗ To train both pre-service and in-service mental health professionals in gender diversity and \ntransgender issues.\n ↗ To provide professional development training for mental health support staff (i.e. administrative \nstaff) on inclusive practice for gender diverse and transgender individuals. \n ↗ To access information about specialist services for gender diverse and transgender mental health \n89\ncare in order to make appropriate referrals when issues beyond their expertise arise.\n ↗ To promote transgender and gender diverse-friendly health services once health professionals and \nsupport staff are adequately trained.\n ↗ To address complaints about inappropriate behaviour towards transgender and gender diverse \nindividuals in an appropriate and timely manner.\n ↗ To provide parents of gender diverse and transgender children with information regarding sources \nof information and support. \nSupport services\n ↗ To provide easily accessible support for transgender and gender diverse young people on multiple \nplatforms, including face-to-face and online.\n ↗ To provide education and peer-led support for parents of gender diverse and transgender young \npeople.\n ↗ To create spaces where young people can bring their voices to the community in a safe manner.\n ↗ To recognise the unique needs and challenges experienced by gender diverse and transgender \nyoung people, and acknowledge that these needs and challenges are different from those of \ncisgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals. \nCommunity health organisations and local councils \n ↗ To represent gender diversity positively in the public sphere through inclusive service promotional \nmaterial.\n ↗ To promote the need for gender diversity training for staff members of local government-run \nfacilities such as leisure centres.\n ↗ To contribute to community resilience by playing a part in information-sharing about local support \nservices and appropriate referrals.\n ↗ To include gender diversity in all community inclusion or diversity plans and programs.\n ↗ To include gender diversity within new and existing violence against women initiatives as well as \nchallenging rigid gender stereotypes. \nSchools and education professionals\n ↗ To train teachers and school leadership, through adequately funded programs, in appropriate, \nsupportive behaviour and language towards gender diverse and transgender students.\n ↗ To sensitively respond to students’ needs for appropriate, private, and safe toilet facilities.\n ↗ To develop and promote school uniform policies that allow transgender and gender diverse young \npeople to appropriately express their gender identity. \n ↗ To support gender diverse and transgender young people by providing access to wellbeing support \nstaff, while also recognising that in some cases school chaplains may not be readily trusted by \ngender diverse and transgender young people. \n ↗ To provide inclusive sexuality education programs, combined with appropriate training for current \nstaff to deliver such programs.\n ↗ To proactively provide support and policies on the understanding that there will always be gender \ndiverse and transgender students, rather than waiting for these issues to arise. \n ↗ To create an environment where students feel safe to advocate for their own needs and rights at \n90\nschool and within the broader community.\n ↗ To ensure that all counsellors and student wellbeing staff deliver confidential support for gender \ndiverse and transgender students. \nFurther research\n ↗ To explore the experiences and needs of intersex young people in Australia.\n ↗ To explore the particular health needs of, and protective factors for, transgender and gender \ndiverse young people who identify as pansexual, bisexual or queer.\n ↗ To identify the specific needs of, and protective factors for, gender diverse and transgender young \npeople from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.\n ↗ To identify the specific needs of, and protective factors for, gender diverse and transgender young \npeople who live with a disability.\n ↗ To explore transgender and gender diverse young people’s experiences with other health and \nwelfare professionals such as social workers and employment officers in order to develop nuanced \nmodels of care. \nGeneral\n ↗ That the implementation of the above recommendations involves gender diverse and transgender \norganisations and individuals, with those involved being active participants who are offered \nremuneration. \n91\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics.

    "abstract": "This study of gender diverse and transgender young people reveals high rates of depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis report is the culmination of many months of engagement across Australia with young people aged between 14 and 25 who have shared their thoughts, understandings, experiences, hopes and dreams with us through an online survey and online interviews. Their narratives are insightful, touching, and hopeful. Young voices have told us how they care for themselves as well as shining a light on how health services, schools, government and policy makers can better serve their needs.\n\nThis research was designed to expand on findings from previous Australian research with young people that found that gender-questioning and transgender young people not only experienced higher rates of self-harm and suicidal thoughts, but were also more likely to be involved in activism than their cisgender and same-sex attracted peers. This later finding is a potentially positive one and points to the need for research to not only explore the mental health needs of these young people but also the ways in which they advocate and care for themselves in the face of discrimination and abuse",
