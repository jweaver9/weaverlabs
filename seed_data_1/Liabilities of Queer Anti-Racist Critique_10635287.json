See for example Newman (2010); Douglas(2010) as well as Ahmed’s contribution and the roundtable discussion titled ‘Queer Anti-Racist Activismand Strategies of Critique’ in this issue.123Fem Leg Stud (2011) 19:107–118DOI 10.1007/s10691-011-9181-6Author's personal copyearlier apology, Raw Nerve Books released a statement declaring that due to‘factual errors’ and ‘inaccuracies’ in the book they had ‘no alternative’ but to refrainfrom republishing.3 As a result, the book is no longer available for re-ordering and,with no reprints in production, the authors and editors of Out of Place have becomeeffectively subject to the same form of silencing they critique.The Politics of Queer Anti-Racist CritiqueAs we followed the responses to the Out of Place controversy we were struck byhow much was at stake. The disappearance of the book—one of the first editedcollections in Britain on queerness and raciality—is itself a serious loss. Indeed, theOut of Place collection provided a significant contribution to wider practices ofqueer anti-racist critique. While we resist the notion of strictly defining whatconstitutes ‘queer anti-racist critique’, we characterise it in broad terms as a criticalethos or approach that refuses to separate questions of gender, sexuality, andqueerness,4 from questions of raciality and racialisation.5 This form of intersectionalcritique serves as a tool for building spaces and movements that are committed tointerrogating gender and sexuality norms, whilst simultaneously identifying,challenging, and countering the overt and embedded forms of racism that shapethem.3 For a series of critical responses to the apology, see the contribution by Ahmed in this issue, as well asRothe (2009), Erel and Klesse (2009), Aizura (2009) and Douglas (2010).4 Although ‘queer’ is commonly used as an umbrella term for various sex/gender identities (i.e., lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender, two-spirited, etc.), its roots also emerge from a critique of identity itself.Rather than trying to ‘normalize’ homosexuality in relation to heterosexuality (which is the aim of manyrights-seeking projects), ‘queer’ seeks to question the norm itself and contest binary logics altogether(Butler 1993; Sedgwick 1990; Jagose 1996). For our purposes, ‘queer’ is a practice or way of doing thingsthat challenges the logic of the norm. However, we also recognize that an overemphasis on queer ‘aspractice’ can dangerously ignore the ways in which some bodies mark themselves or are marked as queer.Therefore, while wanting to maintain a conception of queerness ‘as practice’, we also want to attend tothe importance of ‘queerness’ as experienced by particular bodies (e.g., gender non-conforming orsexually-dissident subjects). Finally, we also recognise the limits of ‘queer’ as a category itself, both interms of the continuing debates about its use (and the historical and geographical specificity of thecontexts in which it is evoked), and in terms of the inability of a single term to fully encapsulate thefluidity of people’s multiple experiences and identity practices.5 We use the terms raciality and racialisation to draw attention to the fact that race is not a static, fixed,essentialist or biological category, but instead an unstable and complex set of processes of individual,group and spatial categorisations. Theses processes of categorisation are informed by social, economic,historical and political factors which have been explored by critical race, postcolonial and anticolonialthinkers such as Goldberg (2001), Crenshaw et al. (1996) and Wing et al. (2003). We follow Jivraj andHerman in describing racialisation as a ‘form of understanding and way-finding—usually throughphenotypical signifiers or characteristics—when encountering persons perceived as alien to the ‘‘home’’environment’ (Jivraj and Herman 2009). These phenotypical characteristics can be perceived to relegatethe people possessing them to distinct and even inferior ‘racial’ or ethnic collectivities (Miles and Brown2003, 100; Said 1978). However, these processes of racialisation are not only taken up in relation tophenotypical signifiers but also in relation to class, as well as embodied cultural and religious practices.For example, as Sherene Razack and others have pointed out, this form of ‘race thinking’ in the post9/11 Euro-Atlantic context and the global ‘war on terror’, has come to mark minority religiousidentifications—and Muslims in particular—as racialised (Razack 2008). See also Brown (2006) and forcritical race readings of representations of Jews and Jewishness in English law, Herman (2011).108 S. Douglas et al.123Author's personal copyIn the contemporary political landscape, the need for queer antiracist critique hasperhaps never been greater. Sexuality, in the form of gay rights,6 is increasinglytaken up by both liberal and conservative forces as a dominant marker of ‘westernvalues,’ which then serves as a key trope in the global war against terror7 and apawn in the demise of even the most assimilationist notions of state multicultur-alism.8 Whether we consider David Cameron’s recent speech on ‘muscularliberalism’,9 the emergence of a gay wing of the English Defence League,10 or therecent East End Gay Pride in London,11 the pitting of sexual diversity as a sign ofmodern civility against the ‘backwardness’ of certain forms of racialisation is a keyproblematic.12 Such examples demonstrate that this discourse not only comes fromConservative Prime Ministers and right-wing nationalist groups but also from localgrassroots LGBT organisers. The currency of this discourse in LGBT organisingitself is a topic further explored throughout this Special Issue. Significantly, as Puarand Ahmed both point out in their contributions, the use of gender and sexuality inthe service of racist and imperialist agendas is not new, but its contemporarymanifestations are deployed through novel modes and with reinvigorated force.The critique of this problematic conjuncture between gay rights and racism has,of course, already been made many times. Indeed, Out of Place was one suchexample that assembled a broad body of work on this subject together in onecollection. As such, the loss of the book reminds us that such events also mark a lossof energy and momentum required to articulate queer anti-racist critique in the firstplace.13 As Ahmed notes in her contribution, when such critiques are ignored,dismissed, or undocumented, the critic must start over; the critique must be madeagain. Yet in the aftermath of silencing, the conditions of critique become all themore difficult, not only because the space for articulation has been narrowed, but6 Our focus is on the confluence of gay rights and racism, but it is significant to note that these discoursesalso circulate in the defence of women’s rights, especially for women who stand in as the racialisedOthers who are in need of saving through western imperialist interventionism. One can think here ofGayatri Spivak’s popularly cited description of ‘white men saving brown women from brown men’(Spivak 1988), which both Ahmed and Puar discuss in their contributions to this Special Issue. In Puar’swords, ‘the ‘‘woman question’’ is now being supplanted with the ‘‘homosexual question’’’(Puar 2011).7 Much activist and academic work has been done exploring this conjuncture. In addition to the chapter‘Gay Imperialism’ by Haritaworn et al., see also Haritaworn (2008), Kuntsman (2008a, 2008b), andButler (2008).8 See both Ahmed and Lentin’s contribution to this Special Issue. For feminist, anti-racist critiques ofstate multiculturalism see Bannerji (2000), Yuval-Davis (1999), Bhandar (2009) and Fortier (2010).9 David Cameron’s speech, given in Munich on 5 February 2011 is available at: http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/speeches-and-transcripts/2011/02/pms-speech-at-munich-security-conference-60293.10 The English Defence League (EDL) is a far right, anti-Muslim group in England. For a discussion ofthe EDL’s gay wing, see the Guardian’s expose´ (Taylor 2010) as well as commentaries by Gary Younge(2010) and Jasbir Puar (2010).11 In March 2011, plans for a ‘gay pride’ march in East London were cancelled when it was revealed thatorganisers had links with the English Defence League and other anti-Muslim groups. See the RoundtableDiscussion postscript in this issue for further details, as well as the Decolonize Queer statement (2011).12 See for example, Puar (2007), Kato (2010), Douglas (2011) and Ekine and Ali (2010).13 As noted in the introduction to Out of Place, the very capacity to articulate such critique in the firstplace was a struggle (Kuntsman and Miyake 2008a). See also the roundtable discussion in this issue.Liabilities of Queer Anti-Racist Critique 109123Author's personal copyalso because different kinds of labour and energy (physical, emotional, andaffective) are required to make the critique yet again. The struggle against thison-going threat of fatigue and loss of momentum is just one example of what wewant to highlight as a larger issue of ‘liabilities of critique’.We use ‘liabilities of critique’ to focus attention on the social, political, andeconomic consequences of articulating queer anti-racist critique. Indeed, our useof the term does not denote a strictly legal connotation of ‘liability’ (i.e., as in atortious claim).14 Rather, we aim to intentionally displace this term from its legalframework in order to consider the costs of such critiques that are not captured by ajuridical framing. Consequently, contributors to this Special Issue of Feminist LegalStudies explore what it takes to conceive of, assemble, defend, and bear the cost ofqueer anti-racist critique in academic and activist settings. Questioning the social,political, and economic conditions that inform, envelop, and stifle these critiques,this Special Issue examines the workings and formations of power relations thatmake some people more or less subject to the ‘liabilities of critique’.Events, Responses and Dilemmas: Rethinking the Terms of DebateReflecting on the broader implications of the loss of Out of Place, we wonderedwhat would have been required for the events to unfold differently. Contemplatinghow we might respond, we faced a number of concerns and dilemmas. Asacademics and activists committed to queer antiracist critique, how should we enterthe discussion and on what terms? Who might benefit from particular kinds ofresponses and who would not? What kind of collective responsibilities do we haveto take up these issues and support those who make queer antiracist critique,particularly when some people have more to lose in the ensuing fallout than others?Below we elaborate on four key issues that imbued our thinking as we tried toconceive of how a queer anti-racist critique might further be brought to bear15 on theOut of Place events.Firstly, we struggled with how to even talk about the Out of Place controversy.Indeed, what is at stake in the very language we choose to name and think throughthe event? How does describing it in particular terms or frameworks shape thepossibilities for critique? We might consider, for example, the language used todescribe different but related cases in other contexts, such as the public,professional, and even criminal reprisals against North American academics SuneraThobani and Andrea Smith for their articulations of antiracist critique.16 In these14 There is of course overlap between a legal and lay usage of the term ‘liability’ in that people makingcritique who are subject to social and political liabilities can also face legal threats of libel. Although wedo not take up the matter of legal reform here, British libel law has been recently subject to considerablereform efforts. See for example the English PEN and Index Libel Report (2009).15 For a number of queer anti-racist responses to the events see footnote 3.16 Smith and Thobani have been subject to personal and professional attacks for their work, and inThobani’s case, threats of criminalisation. Although criminal charges never materialised, Thobani wassubject to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for remarks she made at a conferencein 2001, in which she criticised US foreign policy in and its ‘war on terror’ (Thobani 2002, Thobani110 S. Douglas et al.123Author's personal copycases, the events were framed as being primarily about ‘censorship’, ‘freedom ofspeech’, and ‘academic freedom.’ However, we were cautious of uncriticallyinvoking these terms in the Out of Place case, not only for fear of implicitlyvalorising the liberal legal paradigm to which they belong, but also because suchframeworks inevitably constrain the discussion within a prescribed set of conceptsand debates.For example, the aforementioned North American examples have been primarilycharacterised as matters of ‘academic freedom’.17 As a result, the conversation oftenbecomes about a subsequent issue—freedom of thought in the American academy—rather then the initial anti-racist critique made by the individual in question.Moreover, the alluring paradigm of ‘academic freedom’ also invokes value-ladenimaginations of justice that pivot on the attainment of universal rights. Yet, asWendy Brown has argued, the assumed ‘universality’ behind any rights discourseignores the power and potential of rights to empower people in different ways.Indeed as Brown states universally distributed rights can ‘function not only aspower but also as deprivation’ (Brown 2002, 423). Brown’s analysis is particularlyrelevant in this context, as the framework of ‘academic freedom’ pivots on anassumption about equal access to education that does not fully consider the socio-economic issues that underpin the possibility of being an equal-rights bearer in thefirst place. As such, when the overarching argument becomes explicitly about‘academic freedom’, the original anti-racist critique is not only subsumed by thesubsequent discussion, but the very parameters of the discussion have a propensityto set the terms in liberal universal rights discourse. Our project of queer anti-racistcritique aims to resist the limitations of this framing, by both recognising theimportance of the original critique, as well as excavating the under-acknowledgedpower relations that shape our imaginations of justice. We therefore struggled overour ability to talk and think about the event in ways that corresponded with ourvision of a queer anti-racist critique that takes these underlying issues into account.Secondly, we found it difficult to respond to such events in ways that attended tothe specificity of the circumstances, while also recognising the broader relationsof power that enable such events to occur. On the one hand, there is a tendency totreat these situations as single, one-off events. In the case of the Out of Placecontroversy, news stories, blog posts, and Tatchell’s own response discussed theincident in conventional journalistic style, reporting a singular news event byrelaying the ‘objective’ details of the case.18 However, critical cultural studiestheorists and media scholars have long explored the ways in which journalisticFootnote 16 continued2003). For a discussion of Smith’s case, see Cotera (2010). More generally see McLaren, Best andNocella (2010), and the special themed issues of Social Text (Schueller and Dawson 2007), the BritishJournal of Educational Studies (Hayes 2009) and Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory (Ticktin 2009).17 For further discussion of the prevalent discourse of ‘academic freedom’, especially in the NorthAmerican context, see Haritaworn’s comments in the roundtable discussion as well as the references infootnote 19.18 See for example the media coverage in the Pink Paper (Marvin 2009) and Pink News (2009) as well asPeter Tatchell’s own press releases (Tatchell 2009).Liabilities of Queer Anti-Racist Critique 111123Author's personal copyaccounts of stories orient the readers’ attention to a particular narrative.19 Oftensuch descriptions present such events as isolated incidents with no links to similarhistorical occurrences or patterns. For example, when The Pink Paper and Tatchellreported on the Raw Nerve apology, it was characterised as a one-off event. Thisframing distanced the event from within a broader context of critiques questioningthe racial politics of Peter Tatchell’s gay rights activism.20 For us, one of the keyimperatives of queer anti-racist critique is understanding how events might fit intolarger patterns of systemic racism. Queer anti-racist critique must resist treatingthese events as isolated occurrences, and instead make connections where individualevents are linked to historic legacies of racism.On the other hand however, when such events are situated within a longerhistorical narrative, they are often framed in ways that miss the complexity of thespecific conditions and power relations that give rise to the event itself. Indeed, insome instances the Out of Place controversy was not treated as a one-off event, butas part of a longer narrative of hate and smear directed against Tatchell.21 In thisframing, there is recognition of historical contingency but the narrative tells a veryparticular story—in this case, the story of an innocent community activist beingattacked by intellectuals. What is significant here for queer anti-racist critique ishow these narratives mask the social, economic and political conditions of who canspeak and on what terms.22In the case of Out of Place, the authors, who were challenged by Tatchell and hissupporters, were unable to re-insert into the debates what had been missed or left outof particular narratives. This was largely due to the ever-present threat of legalaction—an issue of particular concern in the UK context.23 Indeed, several partiesdirectly involved were unable to speak to others about the specific details of thecase, or to speak about the threat of legal action at all.24 The instigator of the legalthreat holds the economically and legally privileged position to speak publicly about19 See for example Hackett and Carroll (2006), Hall et al. (1978), Hugill (2010), and White (White1984).20 See for example African LGBTI Human Rights Defenders (2007), Livingstone (2005), and Long(2009).21 See T., David (2009) as well as Tatchell in footnote 18 above.22 For example, the events surrounding Raw Nerve and ‘Out of Place’ were the subject of a panel at the‘Dissident Citizenship: Queer Postcolonial Belonging’ conference held at the University of Sussex inJune 2010. The panel, which was set up by the Brighton and Sussex Sexualities Network, played out as a‘pro and con’ debate about the article, a structure that made it difficult to discuss the complexities of theevent and its fall-out. This conference is also mentioned in the activist roundtable discussion included inthis Special Issue.23 UK libel law is remarkably supportive of complainants, putting the burden of proof on the defendant.As Dan Hind, author of The Return of the Public (Verso 2010), writes: ‘The plaintiff doesn’t even have toprove that a claim is untrue. The defendant must be able to establish in court that a claim is true. And heor she has to do this with primary sources—sworn witness statements, testimony in court. The game isrigged to make it all but impossible to say anything substantial about any powerful individual orinstitution without running eye-watering risks’ (Hind 2010). In such cases, it is most often smarter—financially and legally—to retract and apologize, rather than risk going to trial on uncertain legal terms.24 This topic is further explored in the roundtable discussion. See also the recent case of Spiller v Joseph[2010] UKSC 53. Lord Phillips renamed and expanded the scope of the defence of fair comment to‘honest comment’. This change now reduces the burden on defendants to identify facts they are112 S. Douglas et al.123Author's personal copythe case as any further public announcements made by the defendant can be usedagainst them in a potential libel suit.25 In such cases, the instigator may discussdetails of the case in public settings, including with the press, while the defendantand their supporters are effectively silenced through legally instantiated economiccoercion. This conundrum poses real problems when attempting to read and writeabout such events in ways that take into consideration the myriad socio-economicforces, and political risks at play.Thirdly, we were challenged to think how we could draw attention to the often-unseen material costs of queer anti-racist critique. By material costs, we werethinking particularly of the social, economic and emotional labour required both tomake the critique in the first place as well as to respond to the subsequent fall-out.We were also thinking of the way that the risks of articulating critique (i.e., losingone’s job or organisational funding, facing a lawsuit, being labelled as atroublemaker, etc.) can be unevenly distributed. Certainly, due to already existingsocio-economic conditions, some people have more to lose than others. This is oftenthe case for precarious academic workers, particularly those without a permanentposition or departmental support, who can expect to face the full legal and economicforce of the fallout by themselves. As outlined in both the roundtable discussion andJivraj and de Jong’s contribution herein, this is also a key concern for those workingwithin small grassroots organisations such as the Safra Project in the UK orMerhaba in Belgium that organise around issues of sexuality and racialisation. Theinformal and undocumented ways in which such organisations operate with little, ifany, funding or institutional support often remains unrecognised. Yet if we areconcerned about the conditions that limit and constrain queer anti-racist critique, itis important to attend to the social, economic and personal costs of articulating thosecritiques.Lastly, as we contemplated how to respond, we considered the pitfalls ofprivileging ‘voice’ in articulating critique. Although one of the central aims of thisSpecial Issue is to document the stifling of certain forms of critique, we alsoquestion the assumption that speaking necessarily equals emancipation, or thatarticulation is a precondition for remedying injustice. For example, as Jivraj and deJong argue in their contribution, the presumption that gay liberation must beperformed through the public articulation of one’s sexuality (i.e., being ‘out andproud’) privileges a narrow idea of what it means to be a ‘gay’ subject, therebydenying or erasing the multiple other ways that such sexualities can be lived orinhabited. The assertion of some identity practices as more authentic than othersworks to regulate and discipline subjects into conforming to the norms of the propersexual subject.Moreover, some feminist theorists have drawn attention to the problems ofinvoking a politics of ‘voice’ or ‘breaking silence’ for its oft unseen attachment tonaturalised and essentialist ideas of the subject that can then authentically speakFootnote 24 continuedcommenting on with ‘sufficient particularity’ [see further Rhind’s (2010) Case Comment]. Lord Phillipsalso called on the Law Commission to consider and review the present state of the defence.25 See English PEN and Index Report (2009) noted above in footnote 14.Liabilities of Queer Anti-Racist Critique 113123Author's personal copytruth about their experiences of injustice.26 Indeed, these critiques draw attention tothe potentially dangerous implications of these politics for their deployment of aconcept of the subject that relies upon, and desires to return, to a natural whole. Ofcourse, such a concept ignores the scholarship of queer and anti-racist theorists whohave repeatedly problematised this notion of the subject.27 These scholars haveclaimed that this authentic subject is an imagined one and that it is better understoodas inherently contingent, fragmented, and incomplete, rather than ‘naturally’ whole.However, while taking seriously critiques of ‘authenticity’ and the privileging ofbreaking silence, we also wish to push these theories further to consider thecompeting functions of racism and power as they come to bear on individuals andorganisations. As this editorial and multiple contributions indicate, despite aproblematised notion of the naturalised subject, the forces of legal coercion, unequalwealth distribution, and precarious employment situations continue to threatenthose who utter particular forms of critique with social, economic, and carceralpenalties.28 These liabilities of critique demand political and philosophicalattention. It is our contention that queer anti-racist critique can simultaneouslysurface the unseen costs, consequences, and conditions of critique, while resistingan essentialist identity politic that deploys claims to ‘authenticity’. The articlescontained herein are an attempt to straddle these concerns by attending to both thenecessity of articulating critique as well as the problems of doing so.Special Issue OutlineIn ‘Problematic Proximities: Or why Critiques of Gay Imperialism Matter’, SaraAhmed begins with the censorship of Out of Place and likens the recurring patternof this, and similar events, to a well-rehearsed script. These scripts not only allowracism to circulate, but also prevent critiques of racism from being addressed.Further, Ahmed considers how particular signs and symbols of language draw‘problematic proximities’ between terms, stringing along silent associations withtheir ‘stickiness’. Ahmed’s contribution further elucidates a key problematichighlighted in the editorial—the difficulty of language in both talking about andproducing racism. She also introduces an important consideration of the affectivequalities of racist speech and how language is embroiled in larger national andtransnational politics, such as in the ‘war on terror’.In ‘Censorship and Citation: The Politics of Talking About the Sexual Politics ofIsrael’, Jasbir Puar also considers the confluence of racism and national politics.26 We are thinking here of critiques launched by Berlant (2002) and Brown (2005).27 See Berlant and Brown above, as well as Judith Butler (1997), Paul Gilroy (2004) and Stuart Hall(1997).28 We are thinking of cases where individuals have been imprisoned either directly or indirectly for theiranti-racist activities. See for example, writings on the incarceration of members of the Black Panther andAmerican Indian Movement (e.g., Churchill and Vander Wall (2002), Saleh-Hanna and Alston (2007),Shakur (1987) and Davis (1974/1990)).114 S. Douglas et al.123Author's personal copyHowever, rather than focus explicitly on language, Puar’s site of exploration is thephenomenon of what many have referred to as ‘Israeli pinkwashing’.29 Specifically,Puar analyses the current Israeli-sponsored campaign to rebrand itself as a harbingerof sexual diversity and tolerance for gay rights. She argues that as the campaignconflates tolerance of gays with liberal-democracy, it produces and relies uponcolonial stereotypes of Palestinians as anti-gay and, therefore, inherently pre-modern. This piece is based on the text of a lecture given at Humboldt University inDecember 2010 with an introduction in which the author outlines how the originaltitle, ‘Beware Israeli Pinkwashing’, generated controversy in Berlin and wassubjected to censorship attempts. The piece is significant for the Special Issue, notonly in providing an example of the kinds of queer anti-racist critique that have beensilenced or marginalized, but also in outlining the broader political context of‘homonationalist’ trends, a pattern that many of these critiques seek to challenge.Building on a critique of homonationalism, Suhraiya Jivraj and Anisa de Jongexplore the ways that nationalist sentiment around a history of promulgating gayrights in the Netherlands can work to silence queer Muslims and curtail queer anti-racist critique. Their article, ‘The Dutch ‘‘Homo-Emancipation’’ Policy and itsSilencing Effects on Queer Muslims’, demonstrates how social policies which aimto promote gay tolerance within targeted ‘minority’ communities, ironically createconditions where it is more difficult for queer Muslims to articulate, address andorganise on issues of race and sexuality. They argue that in the Dutch context, thestate-backed emphasis on the utterance of queerness, in other words, being ‘out’with one’s sexuality, functions to marginalise other ways and modes of inhabitingqueer Muslim sexualities.Finally, in ‘What Happens to Antiracism When We Are Post Race?’ AlanaLentin argues that the problematisation of race put forward by anti-racist activistsand scholars has been displaced by a ‘postracial’ agenda that downplays experiencesof racism. As such, Lentin claims that many self-declared anti-racists activelyparticipate in what she terms the ‘appropriation’ of the experience of racism. In thisarticle, Lentin charts the landscape of this history of appropriation and itsconfluence with state-backed agendas of ‘diversity inclusion’ to point to the ways inwhich claims of ‘antiracism’ have been pitted against each other. Lentin’s pieceprovides some historical context to the discussion of academic and activist anti-racist critique and, in addressing the continued legacies of racism that imbue thesediscussions, highlights the importance of thinking through what we mean by‘critique’.The Special Issue also includes a roundtable discussion that brings togethergrassroots activists and academics who are involved in transnational queer anti-racist work. The roundtable includes Jin Haritaworn and Tamsila Tauqir, two of theauthors of ‘Gay Imperialism’ in the Out of Place collection, and both of whom areinvolved in transnational queer anti-racist activism. The roundtable also includesSokari Ekine, Jen Petzen, and Sarah Bracke, who are each engaged in activist workin multiple contexts, but with particular focus on Nigeria, Germany and Belgium,29 See for example Palestinian Queers for BDS: http://pqbds.wordpress.com/2011/02/23/an-open-letter-to-queer-academics-artists-and-activists/Liabilities of Queer Anti-Racist Critique 115123Author's personal copyrespectively. The roundtable moves the discussion explicitly to the realm of socialmovement politics as it discusses key factors that contribute to the silencing of anti-racist queer activism, as well as avenues for resistance. The participants share richand important insights on transnational alliance building, funding, self-care, and theproblems of trying to articulate critique in the first place.We believe that this Special Issue brings together a number of importantcontributions to the genealogy and intellectual force of queer anti-racist critique. Inso doing, we hope to make a significant contribution to the thinking of ‘queerness’and ‘anti-racism’ together for both activist and academics alike.Acknowledgments This Special Issue is dedicated to Ugandan gay rights activist David Kato(1964–2011).ReferencesAfrican LGBTI Human Rights Defenders. 2007.
