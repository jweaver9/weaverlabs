The purpose of this project was to learn about the lived experiences of outdoor professionals who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two Spirited, Pansexual, Intersex, Asexual, Plus (LGBTQ2SIA+ or LGBTQ+).  In this study, we are gifted with stories that delve into queer identity in the outdoors, with the understanding that not all LGBTQ+ individuals experience the outdoors in the same way. Specifically, this study considers these experiences across temporal dimension of childhood and adulthood, the defining event(s) of coming out, the role of community, and reflections on outdoor recreation professions. Methods. A critical narrative approach was used to promote depth in participant response and to acknowledge the researcher’s role as part of the process while answering three research questions that explore LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation. Creative Analytic practice was used as method to create a queer space within the work. Six individuals were interviewed in this critical narrative project. Each participant was encouraged to guide the study through their own individual expression (Merriam & Grenier, 2019; Polkinghorne, 2007). Discussion. The data were presented using non-fiction prose as a form of creative analytic process. This approach was used to invite the reader to engage directly with participant narratives within the framework of this paper. The intersection of queer identity and outdoor identity was explored. This study makes way for future research to improve that may seek to support queer identities in outdoor recreation.      iii DEDICATION   For us all.

Literature across gender and leisure studies indicate that a post-modern qualitative approach is needed to better understand the experiences of queer professionals in outdoor spaces. With queer culture often repressed or suppressed in outdoor culture, post-modern qualitative research encourages participants to express how situations in the outdoors have contributed to their experience. The investigator works as a facilitator to create a venue for participants, who lack representation in mainstream culture, to tell their story in their own way (Polkinghorne, 2007; Wang & Burris, 1997).  Community through Visibility  A social phenomenon may be taking place that is not yet represented in the literature. A search using the words queer and outdoors on popular social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter generates an array of pages created by and for queer people in the outdoors. At first glance, it seems a merge (intersection) of outdoor identity with queer identity. Taking a further look, this intersection is much too broad and it seems there is a web of identities within the queer identity and presumably the outdoor identity (Collins, 2012).   A representative of this phenomenon is drag queen performer and eagle scout, Pattie Gonia (Appendix E). Pattie takes her name from popular outdoor clothing manufacturer and South American region known for its vast wilderness, Patagonia. Pattie has launched a series of videos on YouTube and Instagram as a platform to talk about toxic masculinity, positive body image, and outdoor culture.    10 In the November 2018 issue of Outside Magazine, Pattie was touted as the world’s first backpacking queen by bringing drag culture to the outdoors. In the Outside Magazine interview, Pattie attributes her more than 229,000 followers to an underlining movement toward queer inclusivity; a culture historically excluded from the outdoor community. Pattie speaks openly about a desire to restructure the expectations of outdoor identity. On Pattie’s Instagram site are classic symbols of outdoor recreation reconstructed to include queer culture like a Chaco brand sandal made into a rainbow-colored high heel shoe or a park ranger uniform used as drag attire (Appendix E).   Pattie’s site is only one example of the emerging resources for LGBTQ+ people who are looking to participate in outdoor recreation. A visual representation of available resources was created by the Pride Outside community group in partnership with The Wilderness Society in the form of a Geographic Information System (GIS) site map that connects LGBTQ+ individuals with outdoor groups. It is notable from viewing this GIS resource that outdoor recreation groups, from running and rock-climbing to private campgrounds for safe assembly, are forming across north America by and for LGBTQ+ people (Appendix F). An increase in resources is a signal of greater representation in the outdoors that will, in the coming years, undoubtably lead to change in outdoor recreation representation and culture as LGBTQ+ identities are expressed more openly. This dissertation dives into the fundamentals of this phenomenon to lay groundwork for future studies that may track the evolution of outdoor queer culture.    Framework  This project focuses on the LGBTQ+ experience with the understanding that individuals live dynamic, multi-identity lives impacted by power and privilege relationships (Collins, 2012). The conceptual framework that guided this project was based on a feminist and intersectional lens to queer theory. Intersectionality is a framework for understanding the complexities of overlapping identities, including but not limited to race, gender, sexual orientation, and class. Some members of the    11 LGBTQ+ community may be more at risk because of how their identities intersect with other identities.   Fourth-wave feminism is centered on intersectionality and includes the empowerment of all women so it is an important aspect; however, this study is grounded in queer theory so queerness remains at the center of the project (Wrye, 2009). Queer feminism was used to understand LGBTQ+ social life while intersectionality is used as an analytical tool to examine systems of power and privilege. Thus, a critical paradigm was used to explore power and privilege relationships that exist in outdoor recreation social life. This research is not transformative in its approach and did not seek to change power and privilege systems in outdoor recreation, but it did seek to uncover the existence of these systems through the stories of individuals who have experienced the impact of living as a LGBTQ+ person while working in outdoor recreation professions.  Reflexivity  Considering the design of this study, it is important to the trustworthiness of the project that I completely situate myself in the research topic and explain why the interplay of an LGBTQ+ identity and outdoor recreation has a profound impact on my own life (Lincoln & Guba, 1986; Tracy, 2010). Post-modern qualitative research puts the investigator in a facilitator role as a way to encourage the voice and visibility of participants that lack representation in mainstream culture (Polkinghorne, 2007; Wang & Burris, 1997). In the spirit of postmodernism, I chose to write this dissertation in the first person to emphasize my place in the project. In addition, I used interviewing techniques to ensure adequate depth of response and participant representation. As the researcher, I struggled with my degree of willingness to divulge my own experiences, and likewise, as an LGBTQ+ person, I understood and could empathize with the discomfort of opening up one’s identity for public comment. I challenged myself to address a topic that is not fully represented in leisure scholarship and acknowledged that I was asking participants in this study to do the same.     12 I will practice my own visibility and voice as a LGBTQ+ leisure academic through the very process of this dissertation. I will ensure reflexively that I acknowledge my role as a researcher taking an emic approach through the deployment of first-person language, while acknowledging moments in the study when I am an observer or outsider. I must reflexively account for my own privilege and power for the sake of the conceptual framework and integrity of the study. The notation of my emic and etic reflexive practice was part of my journaling throughout the study.   Purpose Statement  Outdoor recreation organizations have begun to discuss power differentials that impact access to participation and entrance to outdoor professions (Rogers, Taylor, & Rose 2019). Roberts (2018) attributes a lack of inclusion in the outdoors to a legacy of romanticizing the expedition or trip rather than the concept of everyday experiences. A collection of small, but harmful, everyday experiences could add up to be the difference between a short-lived career in the outdoors and a long career filled with opportunity and advancement (Rogers et al., 2019). Moments of disparity but also resiliency and community are discussed throughout the three manuscripts presented in this dissertation. There are incidents that took place within organizations that actively take strides to make inclusion integral to their culture. So why is the culture resistant to change? The history of the expedition narrative is rooted in an imperial and colonial image of the explorer. Symbolic gestures to support inclusion, such as tokenism, do not address the social practices of which modern outdoor culture was built. According to Cox (2001), a common misconception across the outdoor recreation profession is to view diversity as differences without acknowledging or understanding the inherent dynamics of privilege that structure exclusionary cultures. While structural barriers discourage marginalized populations from pursuing outdoor recreation, it is the perception and the bias of outdoor leaders that is thought to present a more prominent barrier by reintroducing structural barriers and reinforcing exclusionary culture (Rogers et al., 2019). The still very low but increasing number of outdoor professionals who    13 openly identify as LGBTQ+ shows a movement toward visibility, however we still do not know the relationship between increased visibility and inclusive culture. Additional research is needed to understand if increased visibility is a shift from heteronormalized exclusionary culture toward an inclusive culture at outdoor organizations or the courage of LGBTQ+ professionals to create inclusive sub-culture within the outdoor recreation profession (Barnfield & Humberstone, 2008; Bond, Rogers, Taylor, & Rose, 2019; Humberstone, 2001). This study will ask LGBTQ+ individuals about their lived experiences working in the outdoor recreation profession.   The purpose of this study was to explore LGBTQ+ identity in outdoor recreation. A definition of outdoor recreation is used that includes the human experience of being in nature, while performing leisure activities outdoors, to explore individual LGBTQ+ experiences of empowerment (Emmelin et al., 2010; Gelter, 2001; Watson & Scranton, 2013). The term professional is used to describe individuals working in the outdoor recreation profession from the perspective of the employee. Outdoor recreation professionals are expected to have achieved a level of experience, inherent to working professionally in outdoor recreation, that will contribute to their understanding of the topic studied.  Research Questions  Given the purpose of this study, this research used narrative inquiry to capture and analyze the stories of participants working in the outdoors (Chadwick, 2018; Creswell & Poth, 2018). I have carefully selected questions that encourage participants to provide rich and in-depth narratives. The questions were designed to encourage that participants stay aligned with the main objective of the study without restricting how they choose to tell their stories. Three questions guide this study:  1. How does a LGBTQ+ identity interplay with experiences in outdoor recreation?  2. How do additional social identities interplay with experiences of individuals identifying as LGBTQ+ in outdoor recreation?    14 3. How do LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals perceive constraints and facilitators for people with a LGBTQ+ identity? Definition of Terms The terms in this section were used throughout this study and are defined as:   drag  performing one’s gender outside of society’s expected gender norms. It is sometimes a form of gender expression (Butler 1993, p.28). gender identity  an individual’s concept of self as either male, female, or a variation of both that is either similar or different than their sex assigned at birth (Barnfield & Humberstone, 2008).  gender expression   an assertion or expression of gender that may or may not be the same as one’s gender identity or sex assigned at birth (Butler, 2004).  hegemonic masculinity  attitudes, practices, and positions that are occupied situationally to  perpetuate gender inequality, involving both men’s domination over women and/or over minority men. “A core element of the construction of hegemonic masculinity is heterosexuality, and to a greater or lesser extent hegemonic masculinity is constructed as a gender position that is as much  ‘not gay’ as it is ‘not female’” (Jewkes et al., 2015, p. 2).  heteronormativity  a belief or act that promotes heterosexuality as the preferred, normal, or privileged orientation (Warner, 1991).  outdoor recreation    15  the human experience of being in nature, while performing leisure activities outdoors (Emmelin, et al., 2010; Gelter, 2001).  photo elicitation  a method of using photographs taken by research participants to use during the interviewing process as a way to produce rich data by delving into the participant’s experiences using visual symbols (Buckley, 2014; Harper, 2002; Harper, 2006). postmodernism  a critique on society that poses that entire population segments, segments that do not hold power in mainstream culture, are not represented in  traditional scholarship, “The basic concept is that knowledge claims must be set within the conditions of the world today and in the perspective of  class, race, gender, and other group affiliations (LGBTQ+)” (Creswell & Poth, 2018, p. 26).   queering  An act of dismantling heterosexuality as the preferred norm in society, “The disruption of the normative attitudes, beliefs, evidenced to support (heteronormativity) and hegemonic masculinity” (Heasley & Crane, 2012, p.99) sexual identity  how an individual views themselves in terms of their inherent emotional or sexual attraction to other people (Diamond, 2002).      16 CHAPTER TWO  REVIEW OF LITERATURE  \"You never completely have your rights, one person, until you all have your rights.\" - Gay Liberation Front, Marsha P Washington, Stone Wall Riot (1969)    This review covered literature that unpacked the framework of the study. The first section focuses on identity by discussing the emergence of queer theory, feminism, and intersectionality. The second section discusses postmodernism. The final section centers on how power structures impact and lead to underrepresentation in outdoor recreation. However, to provide initial context for these discussions, it should be noted that leisure studies provide a disciplinary lens for thinking about the topics of identity, queerness, feminism, and intersectionality (Alexander‐Floyd, 2010; Jay Prosser, 2013; Johnson, 2014; Watson & Scraton, 2013). It is in this literature that some scholars have notably explored leisure and identity (Eck, 2021; Ho & Chang, 2021; Mielke & Nunes, 2021), leisure and queer theory (Argus, 2018; Carter & Baliko, 2017; Snead, Hsieh, & Snethen, 2016; Springate, 2016), leisure and feminism(Avery, 2015; Bond Rogers & Rose, 2019; McNiel, Harris, & Fondren, 2012; Rao & Roberts, 2018), and leisure and intersectionality (Johnson, 2014; McDonald, 2018; Watson & Scraton, 2013). Furthermore, the study of outdoor recreation can be situated within leisure research as a multi- and interdisciplinary field that brings understanding to some of the most deeply entrenched aspects of human behavior and experience, including those that shape identity and sense of self (Freire, 2013; Junior; F. W. D. S., 2020; Kivel & Kleiber, 2000; Mock & Hummel, 2012). LGBTQ+ Identity  Queer theory emerged from a combination of queer studies and women’s studies during the 1990’s. It is based in critical theory, critiquing society and confronting structures that constrain queerness (De Lauretis, 1991). Queerness is a general deconstruction of heteronormative hegemonic culture (Dilley, 1999; Heasley & Crane, 2012). Queerness became an inclusive term to describe    17 gender, sexuality, and expression in more biologically accurate way by acknowledging variance and fluidity (Dickemann, 2008). As queer theorists sought greater visibility and awareness for all identities under the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Queer (LGBTQ+) umbrella, anti-transgender feminists sought distance between feminism and gender (Green, 2006). This clash was the underpinning of second wave feminism, which was abandoned by some for a more inclusive vision of feminism.  Queer Feminism  Queer feminism arose from a need for queer visibility within the feminist movement (Henking & Turner, 2007). Black feminism also arose during this time for similar reasons (Gaines, 2002). Scholars like Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky, and Lee Edelman were pioneers who brought visibility to a marginalized population hidden in fear of public persecution (Brim & Ghaziani, 2016; Wiegman & Wilson, 2015). These scholars met methodological challenges due to participants that were hard to find. Early literature shows a common use of narrative inquiry to give the participant a voice, while protecting identity (Brim & Ghaziani, 2016; D. N. Warner, 2004). In the early 1990’s, queerness was a clear departure from the binary frameworks of feminism with more focus on anti-categorical sexualities (De Lauretis,1991; Halperin, 2004). Feminist critics of queerness argued that greater visibility for the LGBTQ+ community would erode binary gender norms and cause ambiguity for the feminist movement (Koppelman, 1997). Though, as queer studies grew, feminism evolved to its third wave (Walker, 1992). Third wave feminism was a transgender, queer, race, and ability inclusive form of feminist theory that embraced the spirit of intersectionality (Evans, 2015; Crenshaw 1989). By rejecting essentialism, the third wave joined hands with intersectionality to usher in a fourth wave of feminism. The fourth wave was intersectionality centric with the mission to empower all femininity including feminine traits in men and all gender identities (Parry & Johnson, 2018). Previously marginalized identities within the movement now stood at the forefront of the fourth wave of feminism, which brings us to queer identity today. An individual’s LGBTQ+ identity is core to how the individual experiences leisure; leisure identity is experienced in the context of personhood.        18 Intersectionality  Intersectionality addressed a significant gap in literature, politics, and law (Brewer & Collins, 2006; Collins, 2000, 2015). Prior to intersectionality, scholars and activists worked to advance single issue causes. For example, critical race theory spoke to the dynamics of racial discrimination while feminist theory spoke to the dynamics of gender discrimination. African American feminist and legal scholars noticed the dualist limitations of both critical race theory and feminist theory, when understanding a person’s experience of oppression (Alexander‐Floyd, 2010). The limitations of a silo-approach first appeared as an issue in the literature when critical race theory did not explicitly include the experiences of African American women or LGBTQ+ African Americans; and when first and second wave feminism did not explicitly include the experiences of African American women or LGBTQ+ people (Collins, 2000, 2012; Crenshaw, 1991). Intersectionality takes issue with the entire system that reinforces social oppression for all who experience it, which subsequently, enables intersectionality to absorb critical and feminist theories by giving visibility to individual experiences that were left in the gaps. The idea of intersectionality has long been felt by people experiencing discrimination on multiple fronts, however, the term arose from employment discrimination caused by General Motors (GM). In 1976, African American women applying for work at GM sued on the basis of unlawful discrimination (E.D. Mo., 1976). GM reserved clerical jobs for white woman and labor jobs for African American men but had no available jobs for African American women. The workers were forced to choose either gender discrimination or racial discrimination as the basis of their lawsuit (Ryan, 2019). The anti-discrimination laws did not support the worker’s case against GM because GM technically offered jobs for women and jobs for African Americans. The women were rendered invisible by the law. The laws in place did not account for the worker’s experience of multiple and simultaneous discrimination, which ultimately left these workers invisible to the law. In 1989, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Law Professor, Kimberlé Crenshaw, coined the term intersectionality to describe the invisibility experienced by the factory workers at General Motors    19 (Crenshaw, 1989, 1991). Sociologist, Patricia Collins, broadened the concept a year later to how we understand intersectionality today as a matrix of dominance (Collins, 1990).   Intersectionality expands on critical race theory to explain compounded discrimination when an individual has two or more identities that are marginalized in society. The history of intersectional thought is closely tied to political activism. The term was created out of necessity to explain chronic and targeted violence against certain groups of people over others. Namely, disproportionate violence and disparity against African American women and African American transgender women (Kimberlé Crenshaw, 1989). Intersectionality has broadened to include multiple points (or intersections) of oppression, disparity, or inequity by acknowledging that multidimensional discrimination exists, and challenges us to look at discrimination as a system of oppression in society. Intersectionality takes society beyond a homogenous view of discrimination to understand the complex fabric of inequity (Alexander‐Floyd, 2010).  Today intersectionality has become a multidisciplinary area of study that is applied across the social sciences. The term intersectionality is gaining notice as a praxis or critical framework to situate social science research. Intersectionality, like other critical theories, is based on both social science and a need to reconcile harmful laws and practices. An emancipatory research agenda would address the topic of invisibility in the leisure sciences and potentially lead to reform (Parry, Johnson, & Stewart, 2013). James Edward Mills describes this type of invisibility in his book The Adventure Gap (2014, p12), “It is obvious that we can be influenced by who we see in the media and what we see them doing on screen and in print impressionable youth can also be shaped by what they don’t see.” Mills’ description is a narrative signaling that greater representation is needed in outdoor recreation literature. As this line of research progresses, we may look back and see that intersectionality was a great unifier of emancipatory research when applied across the social sciences.    20 Outdoor Recreation  The semantics of what defines outdoor recreation is somewhat disputed in the literature. Some researchers believe outdoor recreation is simply leisure activities performed outdoors, while others argue that it is the human relationship with nature that is the essence of outdoor recreation (Emmelin, et al., 2010; Gelter, 2001; Pendleton, 1983). A definition of outdoor recreation that bridges these two schools of thought, leisure activities performed outdoors with the human experience of being outdoors, is best suited to address identity-based questions (Emmelin, et al., 2010; Gelter, 2001).   A review of two hundred and thirty-five articles used the term outdoor recreation to describe where, how, and why individuals participate in wild and novel experiences with opportunities for reflection and challenge (Holland et al., 2018). The review illustrated common themes in outdoor recreation activities, providers of outdoor recreation activities, and participant demographics. The most common outdoor recreational activities were paddle sports, hiking, camping, backpacking, and rock climbing; the most common providers of outdoor recreational activities were professional programs like the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) or Outward bound; the demographics with the most unrestricted access to outdoor recreation were white, adult, middle to upper class, heterosexual, able-bodied, and male (Holland et al., 2018; Warren, 2016). Holland et al. (2018) noted a lack of diversity in outdoor recreation activities concluding, “This lack of diversity in participants in (outdoor) recreation influences not only how results are reported in studies, but also their relevance for addressing the needs of an increasingly diverse U.S. public” (p. 217). The findings of this review are worth noting when considering the impact outdoor professionals working at these organizations have on outdoor culture (Anderson & Knee, 2021; Johnson, 2014; Kunz, 2019; Lewis & Johnson, 2011; Parry et al., 2013; Robinett, 2014) A Hegemonic History  The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) is an organization known for shaping outdoor culture. Since 1910 the BSA have introduced thousands of youths to the outdoors. From 1998 to 2015, the    21 BSA sent a message to the LGBTQ+ community in the form of a discriminatory membership policy excluding all members who identified as gay or queer (Johnson, 2015; Eckholm, 2012). The BSA publicly denounced homosexuality as an unhealthy vice, humiliating LGBTQ+ members through claims that LGBTQ+ people prey on innocent victims. Assistant scout master James Dale filed a lawsuit against the BSA after being asked to leave for openly identifying as LGBTQ+ (Hutchinson, 2001; Knauer, 2000, 2001). The BSA defended their discriminatory actions against Dale by likening LGBTQ+ people to child sexual abuse offenders (Knauer, 2001). The Supreme Court ruled in the BSA’s favor for the right to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. The BSA eventually overturned this discriminatory policy, however, this policy has left its mark excluding generations of LGBTQ+ youth from experiencing the outdoors (Knauer, 2000).   The Girl Scouts of America, by comparison, have sought to support the LGBTQ+ identity by working to create affirming spaces within the organization and reinforcing an affirming culture in the outdoors (Argus, 2018). Affirming spaces in outdoor recreation is a fairly new concept and practice given the history of perpetuating heterosexism and the potential harm that a heterosexist culture has on outdoor recreation (Dignan, 2002). While not all situations in outdoor recreation can be considered heterosexist, there are structures of heteronormativity that support heterosexuality as the superior identity thus rendering the LGBTQ+ identity oppressed. Dignan (2002, p. 79) suggests a call to action for outdoor professionals to, “Tear down oppressive structures that we operate within and that operate within us….by acknowledging that the category of heterosexual does not contain us all but does constrain us all.” Some LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals have spoken out about heteronormative structures in their work life experience. LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals have described ways they “manage their identity” in order to navigate their profession and speak about the taxing nature of identity concealment on a multiday expedition (Barnfield & Humberstone, 2008, p35).   LGBTQ+ people have been required to assimilate to a heteronormative social structure in order to engage in outdoor recreation (Barnfield & Humberstone, 2008). The BSA example is one of    22 explicit discrimination and hostility, but more subtle forms of discrimination are more pervasive in outdoor culture due to a heterosexist belief that the LGBTQ+ identity is a deviant choice (Dignan, 2002; Hutchinson, 2001). The BSA’s argument of LGBTQ+ deviance is a form of structural oppression, “Power and privilege are maintained through cultural hegemony with struggles over hegemonic control” (Humberstone, 2001, p. 36). There is a struggle to maintain a certain expectation of heteronormativity in the outdoors, which inherently excludes the LGBTQ+ identity.  Identity and Leisure Constraint  Researchers are studying topics that span from gender ideology in the Latin American tourism industry to structural oppression in sports (Duffy, Kline, Mowatt, & Chancellor, 2015; Johnson & Kivel, 2006). There is no doubt that a deconstruction of the status quo in leisure research is underway. With this movement, there is still so much to know about leisure’s contribution to equity, or inequity, for a multitude of identities (Johnson & Samdahl, 2005; Kivel & Kleiber, 2000). Scholars have hinted at this need for equity for decades. Kivel (2000) spoke of the history and the limitations of omitting identity when looking for commonalities in leisure research, while Wolf (1997) proposed a divergence from commonality by looking for leisure in non-traditional socially created spaces. There is room to study both approaches as there is much research still to do in this area of study; a particular gap being LGBTQ+ experiences.    The Future of Leisure is Queer  The queering of leisure in both practice and research are becoming more well-noted. The National Parks Service (NPS) in partnership with the National Park Foundation (NPF) launched the LGBTQ+ Heritage Initiative in 2014 to recognize the history of LGBTQ+ people. A primary element of the LGBTQ+ Heritage Initiative was a thematic study conducted to examine aspects of LGBTQ+ culture, civil rights, art, commerce, sport, and leisure with relationship to physical places across the United States (Schweighofer, 2016). The first LGBTQ+ monument in the United States was identified    23 and designated as a result of the study. The designation occurred on June 28, 2016 for events that took place at the Stonewall Inn on June 28, 1969. The event is credited in the LGBTQ+ community, and now United States history, as marking the beginning of the modern LGBTQ+ civil rights movement (Springate, 2016). Patrons of the Stonewall Inn had gathered to mourn the death of actor Judy Garland, when the inn was raided by the New York City police department on grounds of public display of homosexual conduct (D’Emilio, 2009, p. 24-25). The patrons of the Stonewall Inn resisted arrest over the next few nights holding ground at the adjacent Christopher Park. This event was a catalyst for LGBTQ+ activist groups forming across the country (Springate, 2016). One year later on June 28, 1970, the LGBTQ+ community came together to march in remembrance of the Stonewall Inn police raids. The modern LGBTQ+ civil rights movement emerged from leisure assembly. Now during the month of June LGBTQ+ Pride marches, festivals, parties, and dances occur all over the world in parks and plazas to celebrate visibility in mainstream culture in the form of leisure activism. These origins have given rise to many more leisure opportunities for LGBTQ+ people, which has resulted in an expansion of sport, tourism, and consequently leisure scholarship.   Davidson (2018) points to a multitude of ways leisure studies “have and have not been queered (p. 79).” Speaking to the latter of that point, in this review, I found literature that captured the LGBTQ+ population doing leisure activities in disciplines outside of leisure studies. In fact, it is difficult to discuss LGBTQ+ history or queer scholarship without inadvertently mentioning leisure. The LGBTQ+ community found and supported each other through leisure. Leisure scholars have historically attributed increased leisure time with industrial capitalism. Through industrial capitalism, white cis-gender males benefited from increased time and financial stability that resulted in the ability to develop leisure pursuits (Davidson, 2018). In the context of historical disenfranchisement, this historical definition of leisure-time implicitly excludes anyone not allowed to vote, own property, or earn an independent income, which the House Ballroom Community experienced through a multitude of barriers many of which stemming from disproportionate incarceration due to discriminatory    24 regulations that were built by dominant culture. The House Ballroom Community example indicates a need to examine the lens of which leisure studies is founded. Many researchers are doing just that, challenging prior knowledge and learning about marginalized experiences within a leisure context and as a means of social activism (Davidson, 2018; Johnson, 2014, 2015; Johnson & Kivel, 2006; Parry, Johnson, & Stewart, 2013). It is clear that there is much to know about leisure in the context of an individual or a community’s identity. It is also clear that the continued queering of leisure scholarship will be intersectional as people and communities are inherently multidimensional.   Postmodernism  The postmodern approach was created to understand aspects of society hidden by sources of authority and power, which is exactly what this study proposes to explore by better understanding underrepresented experiences of LGBTQ+ people. Critics of the postmodern interpretive framework argue that science is meant to generalize across a larger population, believing that postmodernism promotes obscurity and relativism leading a study away from scientific inquiry and towards anecdotal opinion (Thomas, 1993). However, postmodernism poses the philosophy that entire population segments, segments that do not hold power in mainstream culture, are not represented in traditional scholarship in the arts, literature, and social sciences (Creswell & Poth, 2018). A postmodern approach studies the unrepresented, or the gaps not captured, in traditional generalized research (Creswell & Poth, 2018). A postmodernist would argue that it is not valid or trustworthy to generalize nondominant groups with the same standards of dominant culture. It is in fact, the point of this study that we understand the experiences of those who have been missed by generalizations based on dominant culture, therefore, a postmodern approach is the most appropriate fit to study the LGBTQ+ experience in outdoor recreation. To address the concerns of postmodern critics, several trustworthy measures will be taken to strengthen the scientific integrity of this study, however an emphasis will be placed on evoking rich conversation between the interviewer and participant to stay true to the critical    25 postmodern framework as this study is not expected to produce generalizable or postpositivist outcomes (Carminati, 2018). Literature Summary  The purpose of this review is to look at the LGBTQ+ identity and critically look at outdoor recreation to explore LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation. The LGBTQ+ community has historically low representation in outdoor recreation due to discriminatory policies and cultural norms. While the LGBTQ+ community reports barriers to access, outdoor recreation organizations and scholarship are unable to account for nonparticipation for people with an LGBTQ+ identity. This study will take a critical look at LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation to explore how constraints and facilitators are perceived by LGBTQ+ professionals cued into this phenomenon.       26 CHAPTER THREE  METHODS  “Wild tongues can't be tamed; they can only be cut out.” – Author and activist Gloria Anzaldúa, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987)  The purpose of this study was to explore LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation. Queer theory informed by the praxis of intersectionality, as mentioned in the first two Chapters, conceptually framed this project. Chapter three is a description of the design choices made for this project along with the researcher’s role in the project. The appropriateness of how the research design achieves the project’s purpose is also discussed.   Research Questions The research questions created to maximize data collection in order to increase our awareness of queer experiences in the outdoors (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Miles & Huberman, 1994).The three questions guiding this research include:  1. How does a LGBTQ+ identity interplay with experiences in outdoor recreation? 2. How do additional social identities interplay with the experiences of individuals identifying as LGBTQ+ in outdoor recreation? 3. How do LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals perceive constraints and facilitators for people with a LGBTQ+ identity? Study Design This study used critical narrative inquiry to explore LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation, which is an approach that allows each participant to guide the study through their own story and individual expression (Merriam & Grenier, 2019; Polkinghorne, 2007). Critical narrative inquiry protects the identity of the participant while giving the participant a voice in the literature and is common in LGBTQ+ research, however, the use of this approach is in its infancy in the leisure    27 sciences (Herrick & Duncan, 2018). Leisure researchers have begun using a narrative design to uncover stories of marginalization in their field of study (Bond Rogers & Rose, 2019; Lovelock, Jellum, & Carr, 2018). Researchers in the broader social sciences use interviewing as a way to conduct transformative research (Bond, Rogers & Rose, 2019). Having a conversation has long been used to collect qualitative data in the social sciences to collect rich qualitative data (Brinkmann, 2013; Harper, 2002; Kvale, 2011). Participants were encouraged to delve deep into their personal experiences and communicate their story to the researcher as a way of truly controlling the expression of their story.  Data Collection  There were three points of participant involvement during the data collection process with three types of data sources: participant data, researcher observations, and secondary data. The participant self-reported data included a self-identification survey (Appendix A), an interview (Brinkmann, 2013; Kvale, 2011), and artifacts (Harper, 2002). Researcher observations were logged continually throughout the study in the form of journaling. Secondary data was continually collected throughout the study from sources like organizational statements, regional regulations, marketing publications, and/or websites. Anonymity and security of data collection were ensured throughout the study by using pseudonyms to identify participants in the study. Additionally, I used password protected storage sites for data storage. Interview audio data was transcribed verbatim, and participants were allowed to review transcripts for accuracy.  Collection Sequence  A short description of the study with a link to a Qualtrics survey was sent to individuals and groups who openly identify as LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals. Participants were able to share the description and link with others as a way of recommending participants to the study. Participants completed the Self-Identification Survey, were vetted for eligibility, then contacted to schedule the    28 first interview. The first interview was conducted without a time limit and lasted one to three hours in length.   Figure 1: Collection Sequence    Selection of Participants  Participant selection was important to understanding the central phenomenon and conducting a successful study (Creswell & Poth, 2018). This study interviewed key informants who identify as member of the LGBTQ+ community and have a range of varying experiences working in the outdoor recreation profession (Durdella, 2019). Creswell and Poth (2018) explained “…in a narrative study one needs to find individuals who are distinctive for their ability to shed light on the specific phenomenon being explored” (p. 152). For this reason, past or present outdoor recreation professionals were chosen over a general outdoor recreationist as they have a combination of personal and professional experience in the field; that is, they are the individuals who have likely thought the most about the phenomenon under study. Outdoor recreation professionals may also have insights into equity for LGBTQ+ people in outdoor recreation (Godbey, et al., 2015). Lastly, they are also best positioned to answer the third research question of this study, “How do LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals perceive constraints and facilitators for people with a LGBTQ+ identity?”   A combination of two sampling methods, Purposeful and Convenience, were used to recruit key informants (i.e., LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals) and optimum feedback.  Purposeful sampling is a nonprobability-based sampling method used to select individuals who will best inform the study, Recruitment Link Self-Identification SurveyInterview•Qualifying interviewMember checking    29 while convenience sampling is a method used to reach certain groups of people that are easiest to access or the most available (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Participant recruitment included contacting organizations or agencies with outdoor recreation programs, affinity groups, social media influencers, and/or by word-of-mouth recommendation. Participant stories varied in context due to the physical location of their employment in addition to their employer’s antidiscrimination policies and culture. Many outdoor recreation employers are headquartered in North America with field offices around the world. North America in itself varies in acceptance of the LGBTQ+ identity through imposed regulations and cultural beliefs. For example, on July 9, 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex couples equal rights to marriage benefits, while five years later many states continue to challenge this ruling by keeping anti LGBTQ+ laws in effect even though the higher court holds precedence. On June 15, 2020, the United States Supreme Court extended the definition of sex in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to protect LGBTQ+ workers from employment discrimination. This recent extension of civil rights to LGBTQ+ workers and how it is implemented across states came up as a topic at multiple points during the study.  Recruitment focused on a diverse participant pool in many respects; one of which is experience working. A new professional who has entered the field since the passing of recent rulings may have a different story to tell than a professional who maybe retired from the field and has a perspective of changes that occurred over time. This study sought to generate several stories that represented LGBTQ+ experiences in the outdoors with the understanding that saturation is unlikely to be met as this topic is underrepresented in the literature.  Self-Identification Survey  A self-identification survey was the primary tool used to evaluate participant eligibility. The purpose of a self-identification survey was to help determine how an individual self-identifies. Incorporating this type of tool for self-identification helped this study achieve greater equity,    30 diversity, and inclusion as part of the research design by eliminating researcher bias of assuming or questioning one’s identity.   Individuals interested in participating in the study were sent a recruitment statement which included a link to the self-identification survey (Appendix ##). The survey employed was twofold: 1) it was used as a trustworthy measure to ensure the researcher did not assume an individual’s identity or eligibility for the study; and 2) it was also used to inform the study.  There were three parts to the survey itself; it included an introduction, an informed consent, and the questionnaire (Appendix A).  The results from the completed surveys were used to ensure the participants met the criteria to participate in the study.   All surveys were evaluated, and eligible participants were then selected to continue to the next phases of the research project which included an interview and a review of participant quotes (Appendix ##).  A participant pool was selected with the greatest variance in experiences based on survey responses and six individuals were contacted to schedule an interview.  Interview  The interview consisted of a loosely structured and conversational design. Unstructured interviews allow for a more comfortable and flexible environment thereby fostering a positive rapport with the respondents. These types of interviews also provide respondents an opportunity to talk more in depth about their experiences which can provide the researcher with greater understanding. An unstructured-conversational interview technique was used to allow participants the freedom to express what was most relevant to the study. Interview data was collected using a combination of audio recording, observation, and journaling (Durdella, 2019). Artifacts and audio were stored on an external hard drive in a locked location.  The goal of the interview was to gain an understanding of the participant’s experiences, help the participant to become comfortable with the research process, and develop a rapport with the participant to gain greater depth into their story. Due to the nature of the topic, having a positive    31 rapport between the researcher and the participant was crucial.  Identity is a very personal topic, so a certain degree of comfort was needed for the participant to share personal information, especially if their story is difficult to communicate. The interview included an introduction to the researcher and the interview process, verbal consent from the participant, and the administering of a Grand Tour questions to broadly guide the discussion. The grand tour question for this study was, “Please tell me your story of the role outdoor recreation has played throughout your life, starting with your earliest memories, and using as much detail as possible.” All interviews lasted between one-hundred and fifty to two hundred minutes in length. Participants were given las much time as they needed to tell their story, which allowed us to capture comprehensive details of each experience.  Researcher Observations  Journaling is the collection of observational data and allows a mechanism for reflection and contemplation. I used journal continually throughout the study by setting aside time after each interview to document my observations and experience with the participant. Journaling provided the study observational data in addition to allowed to be better evaluate and understand my interaction with each participant in the study. Journal entries were logged after each interview using three category headings: My Observations of the Participant, My Observations of Myself as the Research Instrument, and My General Observations. Additional journaling was logged for continual observations between interviews under the heading Continual Observations with the date of entry. My observations of the participant included body language, background choice for the Zoom call, or any sounds heard in the background. Observations of myself included feelings that arose during portions of the interview, how I felt asking a question, or whether I thought a follow up on a particular item was needed in the next interview. Additional general journal entries included observations spanning from the researcher and participant’s interaction to insights on specific topics discussed that may benefit from secondary data follow up. All observations were compiled and included in the analysis.    32 Secondary Data  Secondary data was compiled and incorporated into the study analysis.  This included information such as LGBTQ+ people in the outdoor recreation profession in the form of social media sites, blogs, websites, marketing materials, or media publications, as well as information in the form of internal diversity plans at an organization, statements from land management agencies that offer guidance for outdoor recreation on public land, or information on LGBTQ+ affinity programs at organizations.  Teleconferencing  Interviews were conducted remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic and varied travel restrictions across North America. Two draw backs to conducting interviews remotely included collecting observational data while viewing the person over a computer screen and interacting with the person in a teleconference setting. The teleconference environment was a minor barrier as some participants found it was a difficult or awkward to delve into personal stories.  It also made it more difficult to build a quicker rapport or trust the researcher.  Additionally, navigating technology or interrupts with technology services were also a minor hindrance for some. Observations of the participant’s comfort with teleconferencing was also documented in the research journal. All teleconference interviews were conducted using Zoom conference technology. Audio was recorded using two secondary audio devices: a handheld recorder with a USB input, and an audio recorder application on a MacBook Pro computer. No video was recorded at any time by Zoom or any other device. The live video from Zoom was used to generate observational field notes. Data Analysis  This study looked at both the participant’s story in addition to how the participant tells their story. The participant’s stories are central to this study and were analyzed using narrative data analysis and interpretation; more specifically, a biographical approach firmly situated in a critical framework    33 while looking for individual stories to generate meaning (Denzin, 2014; Merriam & Grenier, 2019; Creswell & Poth, 2017; Victor, 2009). A biographical approach was used to honor the person’s experience within the context of societal influences like sexuality, race, gender, and ability (Merriam & Grenier, 2019).   I reviewed each individual transcript and looked for stories to generate meaning in the context of the research questions (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Victor, 2009). I first transcribed the interview data with the assistance of a paid service immediately following each individual interview. I began review of each transcription once all interviews were completed. The initial transcript review focused on a high-level view of the story to identify patterns, plots, and social structures. I then conducted two additional rounds of a relaxed variety of open coding analysis on each transcript to segment the data into meaningful codes or expressions (Brinkman & Kvale, 2018). Open coding refers to the initial qualitative interpretive process by which research data is first categorized and analyzed.  I opted for a more relaxed for of open coding in order to “prioritize the full story or sentiment required by a biographical approach to analysis (Merriam & Grenier, 2019).” I then reviewed my interpretations and discussed how my interpretation emerged from the data. Participants had the option to view their transcriptions and quotes at the end of the study to ensure their words were not misrepresented.

The role of colleague’s  Role of the Researcher  As instrumentation in this study, it was important that I disclosed my strengths and biases. I ensured reflexively to acknowledge my identity, within my role as the researcher, by taking a blend of an emic and etic approach when interacting with each participant. There were parts of my identity that were more active at moments, while other parts of my identity fell to the background as I interviewed individual participants and analyzed the data (Ferdman & Deane, 2014). To capture the impact, I had on the study, I journaled throughout the process.  I believe my identity as a queer-lesbian outdoor recreation professional added strength to the study. I was able to ask informed follow-up questions and pulled insights during the analysis because of my years of involvement in queer culture. Furthermore, I had an established knowledge base and    35 understanding of emic and etic LBGQT+ references such as slang, or cultural references. My identify, experiences, and understanding gave me greater access to participants and their stories by evoking trust that their stories would not be misrepresented. My experience and affiliation may have shaped to some degree (in ways that I am not fully aware of) the participants selected for the study, how interviews flowed, the direction interviews took, and how the data from the interviews were interpreted. I built strategies into my interview protocols to ensure the focus of each interview remained on the participant’s experience and was not overshadowed or guided by my own experiences. Another risk to being an insider, in this regard, was conformity during the conversational interview (Creswell & Poth, 2018). There were also moments when I was an outsider. Moments when race and culture were discussed. In all instances, I took care to limit how much I shared of my own personal experiences with participants while being intentional with my follow up questions (Kvale, 2011). I have worked to be intentional with sharing personal information about my identity and background in this paper; but also, throughout the project so the limitations of my own biases are understood. Trustworthy measures were taken throughout the study to strengthen areas where I am vulnerable to the most bias; particularly, my experiences of privilege or oppression. My experience of sexuality, gender, or the outdoor profession may be very similar or very different to other LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals. My experience of sexuality and gender is always experienced in the context of my race, citizenship, and ability and were considered when interacting with participants and data in this study. I have tried to account for my biases to the greatest extent through both the design and my positioning within this project.   Ethical Considerations  A request was submitted to the Clemson University Institutional Review Board (IRB) before data was collected. Once the IRB approved, the data was collected in accordance with all regulations put forth by the IRB. I disclosed the purpose of the study to participants from the beginning before    36 agreement to participate. Participants were not pressured to publicly disclose their identity as a LGBTQ+ person and were reassured that anonymity would be maintained throughout the study. Data and artifacts were stored using security measures including a password protected university website, a locked external hard drive, and a locked personal computer. The American Psychological Association (APA) 6th edition was followed to ensure ethical standards were met.   Trustworthiness Measures and Credibility  Trustworthy measures were taken to ensure the integrity of the study and to protect the personal information of the individuals participating in the study (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Artifacts and audio were stored on an external hard drive in a locked location. Participants were asked to ensure a setting they felt comfortable in to speak freely during the Zoom interviews. I conducted a pilot study of one participant to pretest the questions asked during interviews and the process for collecting data. The pilot gave insight into the logistics for journaling researcher observations as well as using the Zoom teleconferencing platform during the interview process.

A conversational interview design was used to encourage the participant to guide the direction of the conversation. The participant validation, or member checking, technique was used to ensure the accuracy and credibility of the statements analyzed and then included in the final articles of the study (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Participants had the option to review transcripts or direct quotes used in the final articles to ensure    37 accurate representation of their story (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Quotes validated by participants will be included in a final table of results (Creswell & Poth, 2018).          38 CHAPTER FOUR  MANUSCRIPT 1  Stories of Identity and the Outdoors Abstract   Objective: The purpose of this project was to collect stories of experiences in the outdoors from Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two Spirited, Pansexual, Intersex, and Asexual (LGBTQ+) individuals. In this study, we are gifted with stories that delve into queer identity in the outdoors, with the understanding that not all LGBTQ+ individuals experience the outdoors in the same way. Specifically, this study considers these experiences across temporal dimension of childhood and adulthood, and the defining event(s) of coming out. Methods: A critical narrative approached was used to promote depth in participant response and to acknowledge the researcher’s role as part of the process. Creative Analytic practice was used as method to create a queer space within the work. Discussion: The data were presented using non-fiction prose as a form of creative analytic process. This approach was used to invite the reader to engage directly with participant narratives within the framework of this paper. This article will be submitted to: Park Stewardship Forum. Maximum 4,000 word. Maximum 5 photos Keywords: outdoors, intersectionality, LGBTQ2SIA+, outdoor recreation, critical narrative inquiry Introduction  The style of which this introduction has been written, serves as a precursor for how to read this paper. While a postmodern critical narrative approach was used to answer the research question, of how LGBTQ+ identity interplays with experiences in outdoor recreation; prose poetry was used as creative analytic practice for the expression of results. A postmodern approach requires that the researcher is entrenched in the project, so consequently I have added pieces of my own story in this introduction that orient my position to you, the reader, and I have written this paper in the first-person to better situate myself in the project (Bochner & Riggs, 2014; Chadwick, 2018; Creswell & Poth,    39 2018). This approach, then, also requires a high degree of reflexive practice. Reflexive practice informed the design of the project and continued through to the final product. February of 2014, I attended a ten-day backcountry split-board seminar with the hopes of becoming a backcountry snowboarding instructor. There’s much to unpack from this trip, but to distill this example down to its core; it is a raw example of implicit bias. I saw in my instructor’s eyes that he was scared by what culminated into a single moment. My instructor lost control of his emotions resulting in the full force of his body knocking my body into a tree well. A shoulder-check. The kind you would see in hockey. This left me with a lasting shoulder injury, but more than the physicality of the moment, I felt terror and fear. I feared the implications of a large person colliding with my body without my consent. I was afraid to be alone with him on the upper slopes of the mountain with the rest of the group below. He was surprised by his power and lack of control. His implicit rage began a week prior as a minor annoyance before growing into this moment. At this point in my career, I began to lean into my identity by choosing to assimilate and conceal my identity less and less. I wanted to challenge myself in the mountains, but I also wanted to feel queerfully-comfortable doing it.    I began this project with a recruitment call for volunteers. A short description of the study with a link to a Qualtrics survey was sent to individuals and groups who openly identify as LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals. Participants were encouraged to share the description and link with others as a way of recommending participants to the study. Thirty-six individuals responded to the recruitment call. Six participants were chosen for an interview. You will hear stories from Lexi, JC, Arthur, Grace, Kimberly, and Zach. Participants were chosen based on availability and demographic information. Variability in demographics was important to this project. Participants completed the survey, were vetted for eligibility, then contacted to schedule an interview. The interview was conducted without a time limit and lasted two to three hours in length depending on the participant’s availability and willingness to share. The project was designed to capture the stories of the six participants who took part in this project.  The instructor set up a hegemonic group culture early in the course, most notably, when deciding cook groups. The instructor, “All the manly meat eaters are in my group and any vegetarians need to form their own group.” It was clear from his statement that being a vegetarian was feminine and femininity meant weak or less than. This immediately created a split in group culture that was visually represented every day. Cook groups also determined tent groups. Members of the vegetarian cook and tent group were regarded as lower performing and ultimately scored lower during the final feedback that was given at the end of the seminar. This is one example of the many moments that I believe contributed to a hegemonic group culture. This culture was detrimental to the vegetarian groups learning    40 outcomes and performance on the course. I was the only queer or female presenting person on the course and it was my impression that my gender identity and sexual identity added to the discomfort I felt from the instructor. He was not sure how to treat me. I wanted to be respected in my learning process during this seminar as I honed a new outdoor skill. I did not request special privileges, but to be treated equitably to my peers on this course. In the end, I did not receive equitable respect. I believe my instructor realized on some level the barriers he caused after the shoulder-check incident.        This project sought to explore the effect of power and privilege relationships that are found in the social environment of outdoor professions, on LGBTQ+ experiences (Collins, 2012). An intersectional lens to queer theory was used as the conceptual framework that guided this project (Brim & Ghaziani, 2016; Henking & Turner, 2007; Jagose, 2009; Sheppard, 2017; Spargo, 1999; Yang, 2011). I use queer theory to understand LGBTQ+ social life, while intersectionality looked at systems of power and privilege within the context of the queer framework. This research is not transformative in its approach and does not seek to change power and privilege systems in outdoor recreation, but rather, to hear stories of how these systems exist and shape being in this profession.  Creative Analytical Practice  Parry and Johnson (2007) brought to our attention the need for creative analytic practice (CAP) in leisure research due to complexities inherent to the lived experience. While I have based my use of CAP on the arguments of their recommendation, I also believe that CAP has qualities inherent to disarming hegemonic expectations of research findings. This was important, as I wanted to avoid using methods based in structural discrimination and hegemonic culture to present my findings that speak to the destruction that hegemonic culture creates for non-dominant identities. It was a bit of a structural paradox I found myself in. My resolve to this paradox was to create art, an artistic expression of what I interpreted the findings to be. The prose style of writing in the next section illustrates power and privilege systems experienced by six LGBTQ+ individuals who have worked in outdoor recreation professions. I used a nonfiction-poetry prose approach, analogously, in a pattern of three voices in each vignette. This format encourages the reader to have a sensory experience with the    41 piece and better engage with academic literature, participant narratives, and a historical example (Berbary & Guzman, 2018).   A Queer Space. The reader is invited into a queer space in this paper. For the queer reader who is all too familiar living in a world designed to reward dominant culture, the next section is space for self-reflection, validation, and healing. Reflection, on the traumas we have come accustomed to brushing-off so we may still connect with others. Healing, may we find healing in the expression of our identities in the cultures we have collectively created. There is little record of our existence through the ages because of historical queer suppression. The arts have been a vehicle for passing culture through generations by marginalized and enslaved persons. Queer communities have used art as expression while being forced to live in the shadows of society. Artistic expression has been our way to show generations that we exist. For this reason, I have chosen to use prose nonfiction poetry to share participant quotes from this research.    For readers unacquainted with queer culture or unfamiliar with common situations queer people are faced with, the next section of this paper may seem abrupt, uncomfortable, or even confrontational. It may feel this way because we are confronting dominant structures in society, but more uncomfortable than that, we are confronting dominant influences with-in ourselves. I encourage you, the reader, to lean into this feeling. Understanding how we are personally impacted by social structures, is the path toward finding bias that is hidden in the shadows of our periphery. This is an opportunity for you as a reader to empathize with queer people who live out the majority of their lives as a guest in heteronormative spaces, sometimes in places extremely intimate like the dynamics within their own families. You are a guest in a queer space, and you are welcomed here. It is your responsibility as a guest in this space to look outside of this paper and research any information or inferences you are unfamiliar with. This would no longer be a queer space if I were to explain and qualify common queer references, leaving queer people on the sidelines once again. I welcome you to enjoy with an open mind and an open heart. I encourage you to read Love and Nature multiple times    42 as a thought exercise. Please continue to read and engage with these narratives to better understand the importance of why queer spaces are needed.   How to Read Prose. Prose often lack rhythm and meter in comparison to other forms of poetry or creative writing and may even seem chaotic and abrupt to readers unfamiliar with this type of writing. Presenting quotes from a research project in this way is an intentional departure from the voice and expectations of dominant culture and meant to serve as a critique on dominant culture by creating a non-dominant space, critical narrative in practice. A reader unfamiliar with prose or non-dominant spaces may find discomfort in reading research this way. It may feel like traveling to a place where you do not speak the language. There are questions that will be explored that are not met with an answer or resolve. Rather than presenting concrete conclusions or solutions, this creative presentation of data is meant to promote understanding by evoking the senses and emotions created by reading these personal narratives. This approach is a step toward breaking through normalizations and expectations of what constitutes the presentation of imperial research.   It is important to acknowledge, and then unravel, the stories and practices that are passed along through many dissemination lines in the outdoor profession. In this prose piece, I will discuss the story of the Great Fire while simultaneously discussing the framework of this research project and giving a few narrative examples from participants in the study (Blumm, 2010; Mason, 2019). I use the Great Fire story as texture for the reader to better identify subtleties in the participant narratives; subtleties of intersectional queerness, impacted in present time, by decades of outdoor culture. The Great Fire is an example of a story we pass down in the outdoor profession. Any person working in natural resource management is likely to hear this story during entry level education channels. Presented as entry level content, we take this story as fact in how it is told. We accept Pulaski as the hero. This story becomes stronger over time as future generations become more distant from the realities of 1910. For example, the Buffalo Soldiers in the story used the “pulaski-tool” to build a fire line, while Ranger Pulaski did not use the tool in the same way. Yet the tool was later named after,    43 and is currently known today as, the Pulaski. This type of narrative erasure is all around us and this is only one illustration of this phenomenon (Wigglesworth, 2021). The Great Fire is not a story about queer people in outdoor history nor is it a story about African American firefighter’s role in outdoor history; even though queer people were likely part of this story and African American firefighters were the heroes of this story. It is difficult to find stories of queer heroes, or the existence of queer people, in the outdoors because of suppression and identity erasure. I look to glean meaning from a commonly told story in our field by showing you the reader how some stories are told, and some are not. The absence of a queer story shows juxtaposition in each vignette.  Love and Nature  Queer theory is based in critical theory. It emerged from queer studies and women’s studies during the 1990’s to critique and confront structures that constrained queerness in society (De Lauretis, 1991). At that time, queerness was used to primarily identify heteronormative and hegemonic practices in dominant culture (Dilley, 1999; Heasley & Crane, 2012). Queerness later became an inclusive term to describe gender, sexuality, and expression in a more biologically accurate way by acknowledging variance and fluidity (Dickemann, 2008).  Lexi:  “I grew up in the woods and mountains on the east coast in West Virginia 50 some years ago. I had a very free childhood to explore my surroundings and climb trees and swim in rivers with very little supervision. I was blessed with the ability to explore my curiosities and just spend a lot of time in nature. There was never any reason to be out in nature because it's nature and that's what you should do.” (Lexi, 58 years of age, more than 20 years as a professional guide and instructor, white, female genderqueer/queer)  In North American schools it is common for students to first learn about the romantic idea of exploration in their American History textbooks. We learn that the “winners” pass their stories through literature, while the “loser” story is forfeited. Stories of how Christopher Columbus “sailed the ocean blue in 1492” with rhymes to anchor lessons in the student’s memory to create future nostalgia for this narrative. A nostalgia insidious enough to rewrite and erase history.  --    44  Queerness was a clear departure from the binary frameworks of feminism (De Lauretis,1991; Halperin, 2004). Queer theorists sought greater visibility and awareness for all identities under the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Queer (LGBTQ+) umbrella. While queerness has always existed, greater visibility has led to greater acceptance.   Arthur: “The outdoors has shaped me and how I navigate the world… I was an awkward small child that was relatively quiet. I didn't feel that being outdoorsy was part of my identity. I never considered it. I was slow to take to almost anything that was considered the traditional boy thing to do. I think just how far I've come in my own awareness, my own strength and recognition and acceptance of myself. I wish I had the confidence back then that I do now. Would I have embraced the dorky self that I was at that time? Would I have changed all of that?” (Arthur, 46 years of age, five years as a professional guide, white, gay, queer)  We are taught exploration stories that are framed as a hero’s journey. A masculine journey of the hero, faced with villains and adversity, who overcome and conquer. Stories of the winners …. Lewis and Clark…. John Smith…. Teddy Roosevelt. These stories build our framework as we move into the upper divisions of the institutions that built these stories…. Until we accept them as truth without context. --  Scholars like Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky, and Lee Edelman were pioneers who brought visibility to a marginalized population hidden in fear of public persecution (Brim & Ghaziani, 2016; Wiegman & Wilson, 2015). Grace:  “In a meeting I called out some of the hetero and patriarchal ways that have been ingrained into our cultural ceremonies through assimilation and other colonial tactics. We are a matriarchal society, and two spirited queerness is matriarchal…. The elders brushed my comments off.” (Grace, 32 years of age, 5 years of non-profit and advocacy work, indigenous, two-spirit/non-binary, queer/pansexual)   ….. stories of adventure and heroism in a wild landscape. I want to hear the voice of Sacagawea and Pocahontas. I want to hear about a world before the General Allotment Act of 1887. I want to know more about our human history, a past that valued people without owning, a past that valued women without conquering, and a past that valued queerness without concealing.    --  Butler, Kosofsky, and Edelman met methodological challenges due to participants that were hard to find. Early literature shows a common use of narrative inquiry to give the participant a voice,    45 while protecting identity (Brim & Ghaziani, 2016; D. N. Warner, 2004). Identities that needed protecting as the expression of these identities were not safe in society.  Kimberly:  “Yeah, I grew up Mormon. My father was converted. He was very religious. My mom's family came across the plains with all the other Mormon settlers. Being Mormon was a huge thing in my family. We had family prayer every night together and were expected to have prayer individually. I remember praying, every night, that I would wake up the way I was supposed to be the next day, because I knew I was a girl.” (Kimberly, 45 years of age, more than 20 years as a professional guide and outdoor photographer, white, female, transgender, queer)  Instead, we hear the voice of the conqueror in institutions and traditions: The Great Fire of 1910 is taught in introductory fire science classes. The history of the fire has been recorded by the U.S. Forest Service. The Forest Service was started five years prior to the Great Fire during Teddy Roosevelts Presidency. A president that is praised for his advocacy of public lands with a well-documented legacy of animosity toward indigenous and African Americans. The lineage of Indigenous American and African American cultures existed for centuries in harmony with the natural environment until interference from colonialism.  --  Feminist critics of queerness argued that greater visibility for LGBTQ+ people would erode binary gender norms and cause ambiguity for the feminist movement (Koppelman, 1997). Anti-transgender feminists sought distance between feminism and queerness (Green, 2006). Zach:  “That summer I joined the fire department in a part-time role as a wildland firefighter. I absolutely loved working on wildland fires. I was later offered a full-time structural firefighter job, but ultimately declined the position because the chief was sexist. I was female presenting at the time. I was not out, but I got called out as a lesbian by the Fire Chief. I was made fun of a lot at that fire department. That is what stopped my firefighting career. I was not interested in being in that toxic environment.” (Zach, 33 years of age, 5 years of government agency and educational service, white, male, transmasculine, queer)  President Roosevelt selected William Howard Taft as his successor within a year before the Great Fire. The Forest Service, unprepared for the biggest fire in remembered history, was granted the use of military troops by President Taft. Seven military companies were from the 25th Infantry known as The Buffalo Soldiers. The black population of Idaho doubled when the soldiers arrived.  --    46  While queer feminism arose from a need for queer visibility within the feminist movement, black feminism, disability feminism, and many more sister segments of feminism arose alongside of queer feminism for similar reasons…. visibility and acknowledgement (Henking & Turner, 2007).  JC:   “Being black, queer, and raising a child in an interracial family; I definitely check a lot of boxes working as a game warden…. But growing up, I was kinda’ around horses a lot. My grandfather had a feed store and a ranch in Mississippi near the Mississippi river. He had a couple horses on his ranch, and we would always ride when we visited. He had some cows on his property that we worked with the horses. Now, looking back, I had no idea... I knew what we were doing, but now thinking back on it… I was doing some cowboy stuff. I was always comfortable (around animals). That's what we did, we rode horses on the levee.” (JC, 34 years of age, 10 years of government agency service, black, African American, female, lesbian)  The soldiers knew when they arrived, they were sent on a one-way mission to fight the fire. Left to parish, the soldiers built a backfire on the St. Joe’s River, saving themselves, the town of Avery, and slowing The Great Fire. --  Feminism eventually evolved to its third wave by embracing, including, and acknowledging identities (and topics that mattered to these identities) that were previously excluded like; trans and queer gender, race, ability, and ethnicity (Walker, 1992). This movement showed signs of what we know today as intersectionality (Evans, 2015; Crenshaw 1989).  JC:  “It wasn’t until college when I learned about the game warden profession. I don't know if I would have taken to cowboy type things if I wasn't who I am (lesbian), you know what I mean? My sister didn't give a crap about any horses or riding around and corralling cows. I didn't realize it then, but yeah, it definitely gave me a more adventurous personality and led me toward a more adventurous life.”  Firebreaks are often built using a special hand tool that combines an axe and an adze on the head of a wood or fiberglass handle. It is a versatile tool that can dig soil and chop wood, while remaining light enough to carry. The most common tool used to fight wildland fires today. --    47  Intersectionality gave language to feminism that prompted a paradigm shift away from essentialism. This shift led to a fourth wave of feminism firmly situated in intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1991). Kimberly:  “I didn't know what trans was. I didn't know that word until I was in college. And when I did see trans people, it wasn't... transgender wasn't a thing. Transgender was something from Jerry Springer, Ricki Lake, or some other horrible TV show that depicted gender and sexuality in an awful way. It was all terrible “she-males” and “tranny” jokes with taglines like “Surprise, your girlfriend is actually a guy.” I didn't know what trans was, but I knew I didn’t identify with those TV programs. The depiction of trans women was all a joke. I didn't think I was attracted to guys at the time, so I couldn't see myself as that. They never showed trans women that were attracted to women or bisexual or anything. It was easy for me to say, “Well, that's not me.”  While the Buffalo soldiers were building a backfire, Forest Ranger Pulaski pulled a gun on his crew and demanded that they stay in an abandoned mine to survive the fire as it passed overhead.  --  The fourth wave centers on the empowerment of all forms of femininity and feminine identity (Parry & Corey, 2018). Topics and issues of the fourth wave movement are led by the previously marginalized within the movement. Kimberly:  “It doesn’t matter how amazing the outdoor access is…. If you can’t be yourself, the experience is limited. I think often about the freedom one must experience to feel safe enough to be themself, express who they are, and use the outdoors as a refuge...a way to escape everything. I was able to use the outdoors as a place to help me cope, but I still wasn't able to be myself in the outdoors. The scouts kept me outside hiking, biking, and doing whatever, but I was bullied. In high school, I started doing a lot of solo hiking, backpacking, and rock climbing just to get away.   Dominance is threatened when momentum gathers for the visibility of historically suppressed narratives. Stronger tactics are needed to reinforce dominance like eponyms.  --  While the fourth wave ushers in a new era of feminism, first and second wave sentiments still exist; bringing us to queer and intersectional identity today.  Kimberly:     48 “I thought I knew who I was once I transitioned; trans and lesbian. Then a year later, I started realizing that there was more to it. I had not seen all these things in my life. I should have seen that I was attracted to more than just women, and I couldn't... I don't know why or how that was so hard. I could see that I was trans my entire life, but I couldn't see that I liked guys too, until a year after I came out. I had to pretend for so long and try to convince myself that I was the person everyone wanted me to be…...even though it was obvious looking back. I think the industry and society in general has this romanticized view of the outdoors and how the outdoors is accepting to everyone, but it's all bullshit.”  Pulaski was given an award for his heroism. The most common tool used to fight wildland fires today is called a “Pulaski.” --  An individual’s identity is core to how they experience social life. Even in the outdoors, relics of institutions exist, and social life is re-created. An individual’s LGBTQ+ identity is no different and cannot be separated from the outdoor experience. One can only respond to the social environment that is presented. JC:  “Subconsciously, I’ve just always understood the different ways to ride…. being comfortable with the horse is the biggest thing.”  The Buffalo Soldiers were not celebrated or even recognized in the same way as Pulaski. Any queer soldiers were erased from this history entirely.   Closing   One of the goals of this project was to highlight the uniqueness of each story. Each narrative was analyzed in the context of the individual. No two participants experienced their career in the outdoors in the same way, however, some similarities threaded all six narratives. All six participants gravitated to telling stories of childhood, early adulthood, and their experience of being “out.” Participants told stories of their growing awareness of self and how that shaped their personal experiences over time. While these themes seemed to have arisen, and are worth future exploration, the stark take-away was that all participants were doing their best to lay low and carve out a life doing a profession they enjoyed and believed in; the stark un-extraordinary pursuit of living one’s life against the backdrop of navigating a social legacy of intolerance.      49  Untangling the past and present, through the stories we tell, is a crucial step toward a more inclusive outdoors. Lexi, Arthur, Grace, Kimberly, JC, and Zack gifted us with their stories so we might grow a greater awareness of issues that individuals face as outdoor professionals. Future research is encouraged to learn more about queer marginalization in the outdoors, ways to dismantle harmful social narrative and practices in the outdoors, and the implementation of positive and inclusive practices in the outdoors.

A critical narrative approach was used to answer the research question of how additional social identities interplay with experiences as a LGBTQ+ person working in outdoor recreation professions. Participants described their intersectional experiences in the context of community. Community was parsed into three themes: physical environment, queerness in a straight environment, and a changing community. This article will be submitted to: Leisure Sciences. 9,000 word limit including tables, figures, and references Keywords: community, queer, LGBTQ2SIA(+), outdoor recreation, indigenous, affinity, profession Introduction  Outdoor professionals tend to spend large portions of their life working in remote locations with people they hardly know. Community is often built in these spaces. – Zack     64  The ability to form community is regarded as a cornerstone of our species (Knauer, 2014). Community is where humans create commonalities among individuals like values, customs, and group identity (Tajfel, 1978). Community is also where we find a sense of belonging and build relationships (Gress & Hall, 2017; McMillan & Chavis, 1986; Newton, Markle, & Stuart, 2019). In this article you will hear stories of how LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals have experienced community. Working in outdoor recreation professions often requires living and traveling in unique situations, where community is realized and experienced in a variety of ways. From the community found on a single expedition with colleagues, clients, and/or students to the community that an individual moves to for their outdoor recreation job and everything in between. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two Spirit, Intersex, Asexual, plus (LGBTQ2SIA+ or LGBTQ+) navigate established community structures and build community working as professionals in outdoor recreation. This project used a critical narrative approach to look at how LGBTQ+ outdoor recreation professionals experience intersectional identity in the unique social environments involved with this profession. Identity and Community Our strongest identities are formed around those with whom we share closeness through common attitudes, beliefs, interests, and goals. Outdoor identity and queer identity are no different. These two identities are at times at odds with one another when there is a presence of hidden group community norms.  Warren, Mitten, D’amore, and Lotz, (2019) discuss a hidden gendered curriculum in adventure education. Researchers found the prioritization of heteronormalized-male    65 values and traits. They also found linguistic sexism, assumptions about outdoor identity, and gender role conditioning. These anti-feminist approaches to facilitating adventure education, pose significant barriers to women and gender non-conforming people (Warren, Mitten, D’amore, & Lotz, 2019; Warren, Risinger, & Loeffler, 2018; Warren, 2016).  Community is created when people have a feeling of social connections and a sense of belonging (Edginton, Lankford, Dieser, & Kowalski, 2017). Having an outsider identity in one’s community can be alienating. Participants in this study spoke of this in detail, moments where they were reminded that they were different than the other members of their outdoor community. Sense of belonging provides opportunities to build connections and create a sense of being a part of something that is meaningful, important, and bigger than the individual (Sharpe, E., Mair, H., & Yuen, 2016). For many queer people working in the outdoors, this sense of belonging crashes down with the mention of an anti-queer phrase or a hegemonic cultural cue (Ferdman & Deane, 2014).  Methods The purpose of this project was to use a critical narrative approach to learn about the experiences of LGBTQ+ outdoor recreation professionals in the unique social environments involved with this profession. Informal interviewing is a relatively new method used to collect qualitative data in the social sciences (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Kvale, 2011). In this study, I sat with six participants to hear their stories about living and working in the outdoors. The participants were given a general guiding question to get the conversation started, then led the duration and direction of the interview. Participants    66 were inclined to delve deep into their experiences giving the study a rich data source to pull from.  Design. A critical narrative approach was used to explore LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation, which is an approach that allows each participant to guide the study through their own story and individual expression (Merriam & Grenier, 2019; Polkinghorne, 2007). This approach was used because of its ability to critique dominant systems in society that are often taken for fact. It was also imperative to protect participant anonymity while they shared personal stories that could potentially impact their careers and social life (Herrick & Duncan, 2018). Leisure researchers have just begun using a narrative design to uncover stories of marginalization in the leisure sciences and this project serves as encouragement for future research of this type (see Bond Rogers & Rose, 2019; Lovelock, Jellum, & Carr, 2018).  Participants. Six participants were interviewed for their ability to shed light on the topic of this study (Creswell & Poth, 2018). The participants were recruited, vetted, and selected using a survey. A recruitment statement that included a link to the survey was sent to outdoor organizations and social media influencers. Individuals interested in participating in the study completed the self-identification survey (Appendix ##). Thirty-six individuals responded to the survey. Six were contacted to schedule an interview. All participants live in North America. The six participants were chosen based on availability and demographic diversity. Participants were interviewed during the spring of 2021. Each interview was approximately 2.5 to 3 hours in length. The length of the interview was determined by the participants willingness to share and availability. The interviews were    67 held on the Zoom teleconferencing platform, which proved to be a good platform to conduct interviews as participants were familiar with the platform due to the recent pandemic (Archibald, Ambagtsheer, Casey, 2019). Participants were asked to choose a location where they felt safe to speak freely. Participants were contacted in the fall of 2021 to review the quotes that were used in the final iteration of the paper. A transcription service was used immediately following each interview.    Analysis. Biographical analysis was used to read each participant transcript, in its entirety, on the first pass (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Durdella, 2019). This analysis style was used to understand each story, parallel to the narrative approach, to place value on the stories in context. I then reviewed my observation notes to understand my role as the interviewer in the transcript and to review observations I made during the interview. My field notes mostly consisted of points from the interview that I needed to look up at the end or ask a follow up question. Additionally, I reviewed artifacts such as magazine articles that discuss queer experiences in the outdoors, social media influencers known for queer outdoor posts, and geo-political information like local political issues to understand the broader context of what each participant is describing in their narrative. For example, social media community sites like @transclimbercoalition, @queerquechua, and @queertrailservice helped me stay informed with community events as they were announced and held in real time.   The analysis was positioned in the critical narrative approach. I read and considered the stories as a whole, using biographical analysis, to keep the meaning of the narratives together (Riessman, 2008). Initial reviews of each participant interview, using    68 a biographical approach, resulted in broad answers to my initial research question that resulted in the topic of ‘community.’ To understand the dominant notion of community, I subsequently completed additional rounds of analysis using a thematic approach (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Victor, 2009). Two iterative reviews of coding, using an abductive approach, were then conducted to refine the initial theme that emerged from the data. The coding resulted in three sub-themes interpreted from the interviews. Quotes were then pulled during abductive analysis to include in the results (Brinkmann, 2013; Kvale, 2011). This extra layer of analysis, beyond the first rounds of biographical analysis, offered pragmatic insights into data that was initially diffuse.

Through participant narratives, the themes that emerged around community include the impact of being an outsider in one’s community, the importance of the community environment, and the recognition that communities are dynamic and change over time. Together, these findings point to the existence of dominant culture that perforate social norms in communities adjacent or directly within the outdoor industry. The following sections collapse into the theme of community: The physical environment, queer in a straight community, and a changing community.  Physical Community. The stories in this section share experiences about communities built in relationship to a person’s geographical, political, and social environment. The participants discuss how their experiences interacting and living in urban and remote settings with clients, students, and colleagues have impacted their lives and careers. Participants described the overall community and professional environment of the places where they lived and worked1. In this regard, participants reflected on the communities that they now reside, and how these places provide a sense of belonging (or not) by how diverse they are in various types of identities.  1 Additional quotes are available in the Appendix in Table 1.    70 “I think our area has so many indigenous languages… I think acknowledging that diversity is super important to make people feel heard and seen.” (Grace)  Grace, who is a part of the First Nations in North America, describes the importance of recognizing diversity within one’s culture. Indigenous cultures of North America are historically marginalized by western colonialism (Whitson, 2021). Grace begins to discuss the intersectional dynamics of being indigenous and queer within the broader colonial power structure. Grace offers perspective to how colonialism is synonymous with heterosexism (Arvin, Tuck, & Morrill, 2013; Finley, 2011; Smith, 2010). This is an interesting link considering the conquering sentiment in outdoor recreation history (Arvin et al., 2013; Whitson, 2021). JC, who is a Black Lesbian game warden, offers a perspective of not wanting to subject her family to potential social situation predicated on community’s intolerance to her family structure, race, or queerness while discussing communities she intentionally avoids. JC brings to light the complexity of her intersectional experiences. Often she spoke of not knowing whether it was her (or her families) race or her (their) identity as a queer person (family) that influences people to treat her differently.  “I am from the south, but there’s definitely parts of the south that I'm probably not gonna bring my family to live. I don't know that it's necessarily because I wouldn't feel comfortable as myself there, but more that I would not want to put my son and wife through it…I just wouldn’t want to raise a family in those areas. My son has two moms plus one mom that’s black. There are some areas where    71 there are probably not a lot of people like him. That's something that plays into our decision making.  JC’s risk negotiation strategy is to avoid living in certain communities that could prove dangerous or uncomfortable for her family. JC is not only navigating her race in America, she is navigating socially accepted stigma against her sexual identity and family structure (Lim, F., Jones, P. A., & Paguirigan, 2019). A community that maybe comfortable for her racial identity may not necessarily be comfortable for her queer family identity.   Everyone always asks me if I'm gonna move closer to home since there are more black and mixed families where I am from.” Unfortunately, finding a community that is safe and comfortable for a same-sex interracial couple with a small child, JC’s family, is quite limiting to job advancement as a game warden. The game warden profession necessitates living in small rural communities across north America. Many of these communities are heavily influenced by the anti-LGBTQ+ teachings of Christianity. These communities also have racism embedded in the history. For professionals like JC, choosing a community to live in is a power and privilege dynamic that can impact the pursuit of employment opportunities.  Zach also spoke about his experience moving to a community for an outdoor employment opportunity. Where JC carefully considers location when as a risk mitigation strategy when faced with job advancement opportunities, Zach, who describes his identity as trans masculine, found his experience of moving to a community environment where he did not expect intolerance:    72 “I stayed at a hostel at the 1st first Presbyterian when I first got there. I couldn't afford housing, so I stayed there but it was very uncomfortable. It was a very rough couple of years. It’s a very conservative town. The entire island voted for Trump if that gives you any idea of the flavor of the town2. I get talked about on some of the community Facebook pages.”  Zach goes on to give two specific examples of the social interactions he faced living on a small remote island. Transgender people are frequently subjected to aggressive and violent acts of hate(Wirtz, Poteat, Malik, & Glass, 2020). These acts range from hate speech to assault and homicide (Lee, 2017). There is a blatant disregard for trans bodies, where aggressors feel far too comfortable negatively commenting or violating trans bodies (Lee, 2017; Okpodi & Okhakhu, 2016; Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2012; Wirtz, Poteat, Malik, & Glass, 2020). “There's one guy I watch out for online. For the past five years he’s had a poster in his front yard that says Black Rifles Matter. So yeah, I mean it's dangerous. I have a rainbow flag in my window. I worked a second job at the burger joint. The owner was pretty awesome. He was very accepting. My friendship with him led to meeting some other people. I wanted to start an LGBTQ+ group and so we did that summer. We held the town’s first ever Equality March. We walked down Main Street and had posters. About thirty people attended. We put the event on  2 Donald Trump was the 45th President of the United States of America. For more information on the social implications of how the presidency may have impacted participants in this study (Pulido, Bruno, Faiver-Serna, & Galentine, 2019).     73 Facebook Live and a news article journalist ended up taking pictures of us and writing about it.” Zach brings up a common association seeing the Black Rifles Matter sign, among many other similar hate symbols that come up during his interview. Black Rifles Matter is threatening hate speech that comments on the Black Lives Matter movement that started in 2013 as a protest again police brutality; the movement gained worldwide momentum after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 (Barbot, 2020). While this sign is indicating blatant racism, it is also communicating that the environment is generally not safe. The sign communicates white supremacy, hatred, and a threat of violence toward non-dominant identities. To this, end, language that threatens violence is a form of real violence (Warren, Mullen, & McEwan, 2014). Zach spoke of his experience making a place for himself in this town despite the looming symbols.  Each person comes from a unique background and community, which gave perspective to how vast the experiences are of the people who make up the outdoor profession. Zach was able to find and create a safe place for himself and others on the island who were actively harassed, intimidated, and discriminated against. Though, a common sentiment among all participants was how much emotional work it was (is) to negotiate these social environments. These negotiations seemed to detract from their quality of life, overall happiness, and fulfillment. When discussed in practice or in research, we often miss the true impact that exposure to these types of environments has on equity, the butterfly effect of inequality.     74  Queer in a Straight (Heteronormative) Community3. Building from the initial theme that considered the challenges of settling into community environments, this theme goes further to focus on experiences of having an LGBTQ+ identity in a hetero-dominant environment. They also describe how their identity interacts with the overall community and professional environment of where they lived, worked, and traveled.   Kimberly discusses her experience as a white transgender woman working with other women in the outdoor industry. In Kimberly’s statement, she describes a community of women that aligns with fourth wave feminism, feminism that embraces intersectionality and values all feminine identities (Brewer & Collins, 2006; Prosser, 2013; Wrye, 2009). This community value’s queer identity and has centered queerness as a model for shaping their own identity expression. “Because I didn't have anyone that was queer who was visible to me at the time, there was a lot of pushback and friction. Now, it's amazing how many girlfriends I have that are just asking me to teach them make up because they felt like they had to be a tomboy or less feminine. Sometimes they do wanna dress up, they wanna go out, they wanna be more feminine, and that's never been a part of their life. So, it's been kind of fun having all these women ask me for help with different fashion things. That's been kind of cool.” Kimberly gave an example of queer identity celebrated in a cis rock-climbing community. While this example is positive and endearing, some interactions are more ambiguous. Arthur discusses his experience as a white gay kayaker.   3 Additional participant narratives can be found in Table 2 of the Appendix.    75 “I hung out with a relatively small group of friends, kayaking, but there was sort of one or two of those guys, I think we all have these guys in our world, somebody orbiting that's more of an acquaintance. It was him. He was all of the things that I think most queer people bristle over. He said inappropriate things to anyone and everyone he wanted. He had the worst laugh in the world, but everybody thought it was intoxicating and that he was so much fun. I think it was him who had actually started referring to me as Gay Arthur.  Toxic masculinity is a term describing harmful beliefs regarding the way masculinity should be expressed. The term arose as a feminist term to describe misogynistic and heterosexist behaviors and beliefs that lead to violence and assault (Katz, 1995). Arthur describes a group of men with one instigator of toxic masculinity (Brookshier, 2019). This person’s comment led the group to refer to Arthur with a label. In this example, Arthur worked to assimilate to group culture by becoming very good at kayaking.   “That's what people called me in this kayaking group. It took me back in some ways and was also kind of cute and endearing in a way. I think I tried to figure out how to fit in and I doubled down. There was this sense that I had to be the best. I had to try harder. I had to be better than everybody else in the group. I took kayaking pretty seriously, not wanting to be labeled as the gay person. People would often assume that I didn’t have skills, as the gay person. I think that’s the sort of stigma I encountered. That's sort of what always happens. I haven’t had anything outwardly done to me specifically. I think I try to prove    76 myself by doing big water. I travelled to well-known rivers to prove I had the skills to do them… I would spend hours and hours and hours just trying to really think through how to do one move or trick and just really try to perfect that. I think if it was more fun and more social, I might not have been as aggressive at kayaking. At trying to be the best or prove myself.” Arthur was able to fit in by communicating to the other group members, through his advanced kayaking performance, that he had adequate masculine expression to the other group members. His peers in the outdoor industry assumed he was not skilled because of his gay identity. Further, Arthur felt pressure to perform to compensate for the unfounded expectations tied to toxic masculinity. The assumptions of toxic masculinity assert that cisgender men are socially dominant through the expression of certain related traits like misogyny and homophobia (Brookshier, 2019). This of course is a harmful assertion. It is often so normalized that many individuals are not aware of the harm they are creating, though, many are acutely aware and use misogyny and homophobia as a weapon. Grace offers an interesting perspective of how the colonial assertions of misogyny and heterosexism has been insidious to her indigenous community.   “There are definitely some younger folks in my community who are queer and vocal about it. In a community meeting we had recently, I was talking about how I had never really felt accepted in our big house ceremonies. I was calling out some of the hetero, patriarchal ways that have been ingrained into our cultural ceremonies through assimilation and other colonial tactics. We are a matriarchal society, and two spirited queerness is matriarchal. I felt what I said was just    77 brushed off. Not having that validation from elders. I did hear someone say, “I'm sorry you feel that way. That's not how I think we act.” Grace’s indigenous community, comprised of both her family and colleagues in the outdoors, is on the cusp of change. Instead of a change forward, her community is reconnecting to the matriarchal culture set forth by ancestors before generations of colonial assimilation. The queer youth in this community are working to reconnect and relearn their culture.   Kimberly, Arthur, and Grace illustrate how different the experience of the queer identity in a straight environment can be. Kimberly gave an example of the comradery she felt with other women as they celebrated feminine expression. Arthur also felt comradery with other men in his kayaking group, however, masculine expression was not celebrated. Masculine expression in this group was asserted in a harmful way. In comparison, Grace gives perspective how her matriarchal culture valued queerness until it was oppressed for generations by patriarchal and colonial culture. In reading Arthur and Grace’s stories together, there are similarities of how social dominance often rests in harmful expressions of masculinity. These, sometimes subtle, expressions are passed on as unspoken code (Keith, 2020). Society validates this code by normalizing harmful behaviors. It is important to note that the experiences of Kimberly, Arthur, and Grace’s highlighted in this paper do not solely define the participants view on being queer in a straight community. These quotes were chosen as they highlighted three different ways being queer in a straight community can be experienced. Overall, this theme teaches us the broad challenges of settling into new communities, when done so for a job in the outdoor    78 recreation industry. It can be challenging because these may not be in liberal, urban hubs of established queer-inclusive communities, and so a queer identity can be more noticed.   A Changing Community. The stories in this section share experiences about communities in a state of change. The participants describe change that has occurred or their prediction of future trends in particular communities. In recent years, LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations like the Human Rights Campaign have promoted visibility in the queer community. Some regulations have been passed to legalize LGBTQ+ participation in society due in large part to increased visibility and awareness of queer people in North American communities. Through these unique perspectives, we get a glimpse of community culture in motion and insight into what the future might look like.   “Being queer in an indigenous community, especially one so small, it's just not really talked about. Maybe that will change. The younger folks are a lot more vocal about their identity and that's awesome. I think that's what it will take to get the older guard to speak out and speak up or understand. There are a lot of queer folks in our community. I can't speak to their experiences in the potlatch (gift-giving feast) sitting. I do know I've heard stories about people not being allowed in ceremony because they identify as such. I can't really speak to that because that hasn't been my experience. We've proposed to do a session of what it means to be nonbinary or two spirit because a lot of the elders just don't know what it means. We're going to be doing that sometime in the near future.”  Grace discusses how her community is changing by reconnecting with matriarchal ancestry. Grace and a small cohort of community members are leading this change    79 through education. This is similar to Zach who was involved in community organization for change. She believes that the more her community re-engages with their matriarchal past, they will begin to disentangle from the assimilatory teachings that occurred the past four generations of colonial western expansion. Kimberly relates a similar point back to the broader outdoor industry community. “Overall people have this idea that the outdoor community is very liberal and a lot more open and accepting, but …. there are a lot of issues to address. It's still a small movement toward inclusion and equity. There's a lot of friction with folks trying to express themselves, there's a clashing, there's a lot of racism, tokenism, homophobia, all within the outdoors. We are at the beginning of change.”  The broader outdoor community is undoubtedly at the beginning of reconciling a harmful past of which we were founded on (Rogers & Rose, 2019). Both Kimberly and Grace trace this point back to their experiences in their smaller communities. All participants in the study mentioned progress, however, openness or the ability to entertain inclusivity as a topic was the progress, they all defined. If we compare this to the basic steps of problem solving, then we are at the very beginning of our journey as a profession, understand the problem. The next step is to deconstruct our ideology or the way we understand ourselves, as a profession.   Implications  Outdoor professional and the organizations they lead must make a concerted effort to identify the impact of community at their organization. The overall findings of    80 the study point to how individuals experience community at an organization and the adjacent communities that professionals live in order to work at an organization. This could include the physical community adjacent to their operations where professionals are required to live in order to work at the organization. Organizations are encouraged to find creative solutions to an equitable environment for LGBTQ+ staff and adjust when possible. For example, this could include offering a telecommuting option to complete administrative type work so that staff can live in a community of their choosing and limit their time in potentially harmful environments. Outdoor organizations will need to make a concerted effort to identify and create safe communities for employees and clients and should consider the social environments their organization culture creates in the context of the physical location of their operations.  Limitations  The initial research question focused on the intersectional experiences of each participant, however, during the analysis it was clear that participants spoke of community when describing their intersectional experience. Participants went on to describe three community centric categories or themes to illustrate how their social identity had interplayed with their LGBTQ+ identity while working in the outdoor profession. The implications of this project were about intentional community building and the challenges and opportunities we should consider for outdoor professionals settling into sometimes remote communities. This project offers a snapshot of six perspectives on this topic. While we met our recruitment goal for this project, more participants would offer more robust variety of experiences in the career field of outdoor    81 professions. Also, conducting interviews using a teleconference method limits the physical experience of the researcher and participant meeting. Finally, as set forth by my analysis design, I analyzed the participants story as a whole but was limited by how much I could know about each participant given the single interview format and the interview duration.  Final Thoughts   The participants in this story brought to light a poignant point centered on a requirement to assimilate to a single story of what it means to be part of the outdoor industry and the outdoor community. This single story can be traced to racism and sexism in the 19th century frontier movement. As I write this dissertation as part of the Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Department at Clemson University, I must not neglect to mention how parks and tourism were largely found on the idea of the American frontier, while Clemson University itself a working plantation in the 19th century. The embellishment of novels, films, and historical texts have connected stories of the frontier to small towns across America turning them into tourist destinations. Ideology that originated in this hateful and destructive past is ever prevalent in the outdoor industry today. In the memoir Powder Days, author Heather Hansman (2021) reminds us how the myth of the is entangled with our modern idea of the outdoors, a 19th century American identity centered around “explore and claim (Turner, 1893).” In fact, historian Fredrick Jackson Turner published, The Frontier Thesis, that American democracy was founded on this ideology of citizenship he called westering. Hansman (2021) calls this history out for what it is, “A white colonialist construct that erases Native American history.” The    82 notion that exploration and measuring one’s ability has been commandeered by the white colonial narrative of frontier-ing, when in truth many stories have been erased by the colonial narrative that may hold these values in a different context. Stories of bravery and oneness with wild spaces that expand on human consciousness beyond the telling of this single story founded on a racist and heterosexist conqueror.   In the span of human history, this idea of frontierism is fairly new. It is a short history that erases all other histories of human interaction with wild spaces and can be changed just as easily as it was created. I propose we begin moving toward a future where this is the case. The outdoor industry must reframe the conversation by reframing its ideology. We can start by choosing the language we use wisely through a reclamation process targeting industry narratives and storytelling, curriculum, and renaming or reclaiming the names of outdoor space. Rediscover the histories that have been buried so deep, like the existence of LGBTQ+ people (Berbary & Guzman, 2018; Springate, 2016). This also includes reshaping the way we generate knowledge in academia. Research in the leisure sciences has not totally reconciled with the frontier myth, the myth that influences how the outdoor industry defines success.   The LGBTQ+ person’s success or failure to assimilate to a heteronormative social environment impacts their access to community and career opportunities in the outdoors (Mendez & Mendez, 2018; Robinett, 2014; Robinson, 2016). Stories of systematic reinforcement of oppression toward LGBTQ+ people through traditions and practices were evident in this project. Moments of identity affirmation within communities also arose in their stories, however, these were not common and were often spoke of as    83 outliers in participant stories. More research is needed to understand the nuances of what makes an affirming community in outdoor profession spaces for LGBTQ+ people. Using a critical postmodern approach and intersectionality as a praxis will open many of the questions brought to light by this project. Reference Alexander‐Floyd, N. G. (2010).

Methods: Six individuals were interviewed in this critical narrative project. Each participant was encouraged to guide the study through their own individual expression (Merriam & Grenier, 2019; Polkinghorne, 2007). Discussion: The intersection of queer identity and outdoor identity was explored in the context of power and privilege dynamics as evolved in outdoor professional spaces (Collins). In this study, we were gifted with stories on queer identity in the outdoors, with the understanding that not all LGBTQ+ individuals experience the outdoors in the same way. This study lays groundwork for future research to improve organizational systems that support queer identities. This article will be submitted to: Journal of Outdoor Recreation, Education, and Leadership 6,000 to 9,000 word limit including references, tables, and figures Keywords: outdoors, queer, intersectionality,   Introduction  The first time I experienced a queer affirming space in the outdoors was in 2016 after hundreds of field days worked in the outdoor profession. On this trip I hiked with friends in Big Bend National Park to celebrate two park rangers getting married. The couple had been partners for more than ten years but were now able to marry because of the recent passing of the Marriage Equality Act eight months prior. This felt like a new day. An inclusive day of visibility, safety, and opportunity in the wild places I love. Three months after the wedding I took a mountain climbing certification course. I had felt a discomfort with my instructor but could not quite place it. I also had trouble understanding why I was not in the rotation of those chosen to practice or demonstrate new skills, which is often a signal that one is excelling in the course. The culture of the group had shifted, and I did not feel included in the new direction, but I could not quite understand why. During the course, members of our group discussed where they first    102 learned to rock climb at camps, from friends. Our instructor mentioned that he had learned as a boy scout but warned us not to get the wrong idea…. he left the boy scouts because of all the “homos.” My peers on the course responded to the instructor’s comment with deafening silence. I was humiliated, though I wish I could say this was the first time I had ever been presented with this situation. Unfortunately, I was all too familiar with this situation having years of experience stumbling through this social dynamic. I don’t think one ever gets good at being pointed to as the outsider, especially in a situation where the people around you believe you are misbehaving; or choosing to be queer. I had been camping with my peers for the past week and they had met my soon-to-be wife. There is a lot of time invested in preparing for these certification courses that culminate with the instructor deciding either a pass or fail score. I imagine the pressure to pass the course added to our discomfort in this moment. The next day, it was my turn to lead the group and demonstrate my knowledge to receive my score of either pass or fail. Though I passed the course, I had difficulty maintaining the respect of my peers after that moment of the instructor’s comment. I was concerned this lack of respect would impact my ability, in this social environment, to manage risk effectively. This ultimately changed the way I approached risk management as an outdoor professional. I was learning queer-compartmentalization as a way to assimilate in order to further my career.   Traveling and working in the outdoors has brought more beauty and fulfillment to my life than I can describe, but there have been moments throughout my career that have given me pause. Moments I have experienced myself and moments I have observed as a professional working in the field. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two Spirited, Intersex, and Asexual (LGBTQ2SIA, or LGBTQ+) outdoor professionals are often the only LGBTQ+ person on a trip and must navigate the unknown responses of others that subtly or overtly contribute to group culture in the field (Bond Rogers & Rose, 2019; Peeters, L., & Ringer, 2020). It is problematic to expect LGBTQ+ individuals to conceal their identity to preserve group culture or assimilate to heteronormative traditions in order to advance as an outdoor professional (Peeters & Ringer, 2020; Rogers & Rose, 2019). The question becomes, “What culture is being preserved at this point?” While concealment is a personal choice that should be respected, concealing one’s identity is    103 not always an option for all LGBTQ+ people nor should it be the only option. Ultimately, the need to conceal one’s identity has historically signaled a lack of safety in the cultural environment.     The purpose of this study was to explore the underrepresented experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals working within the outdoor recreation profession. The LGBTQ+ population is seldom represented in outdoor recreation or leisure science literature, however, several pivotal articles have been published in recent years that call out a lack of diversity in the literature and in practice (e.g., Eck, 2021; Ho & Chang, 2021; Selin, Cerveny, Blahna, & Miller, 2020). Within outdoor recreation organizations, discussions have begun to address power differentials that impact access to participation and entrance to outdoor professions (Rogers, Taylor, & Rose 2019). Roberts (2018) attributes a lack of inclusion in the outdoors to a legacy of romanticizing the expedition or trip rather than the concept of everyday experiences. A collection of small, but harmful, everyday experiences could add up to be the difference between a short lived career in the outdoors and a long career filled with opportunity and advancement (Rogers et al., 2019). A postmodern approach was used in this research as an epistemological lens to understand aspects of society hidden by sources of authority and power (Benhabib, 2008; Keegan, 2020). It should be noted that critics of postmodern interpretive frameworks argue that science is meant to generalize across a larger population, believing that postmodernism promotes obscurity and relativism leading a study away from scientific inquiry and towards anecdotal opinion (Thomas, 1993). Yet, postmodernism poses a philosophy that entire population segments – segments that do not hold power in    104 mainstream culture – are not represented in traditional scholarship in the arts, literature, and social sciences (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Thus, a postmodern approach studies the unrepresented, such as lived experiences of those falling outside of the majority, in traditional generalized research (Creswell & Poth, 2018). A postmodernist would argue that it is not valid or trustworthy to generalize nondominant groups with the same standards of dominant culture; thus, this study understands the experiences of those who have been missed by generalizations based on dominant culture.  This study used critical narrative inquiry to explore LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation. This approach protects the identity of the participant while giving the participant a voice in the literature by creating space for each participant to guide the project during their interview session (Merriam & Grenier, 2019; Polkinghorne, 2007). Though a common approach used in LGBTQ+ research, it is in its infancy in the leisure sciences (Herrick & Duncan, 2018). Leisure researchers have begun using narrative designs to uncover stories of marginalization in their field of study (Bond Rogers & Rose, 2019; Lovelock, Jellum, & Carr, 2018). A critical narrative research design is well suited to uncover stories of power, privilege, and oppression when paired with the praxis of intersectionality. When introduced, intersectionality addressed a significant gap in literature, politics, and law (Brewer & Collins, 2006; Collins, 2000, 2015). Prior to intersectionality, scholars and activists worked to advance single issue causes. For example, critical race theory spoke to the dynamics of racial discrimination while feminist theory spoke to the dynamics of gender discrimination. Black feminist legal scholars noticed the dualist limitations of both critical race theory and feminist    105 theory, when understanding a person’s experience of oppression (Alexander‐Floyd, 2010; Kimberlé Crenshaw, 1989). These same dualist issues arise in queer theory. Queer expansiveness, the identities included in queer theory, have evolved over time in addition to understanding how identities like race, culture, and ability intertwine with queer identity (Smith-Laing, 2017; Tatonetti, 2021; Yang, 2011). The limitations of a silo-approach first appeared as an issue in the literature when critical race theory did not explicitly include the experiences of African American women or LGBTQ+ African Americans; and when first and second wave feminism did not explicitly include the experiences of African American women or LGBTQ+ people (Collins, 2000, 2012; Crenshaw, 1991). Intersectionality takes issue with the entire system that reinforces social oppression for all who experience it, which subsequently, enables intersectionality to absorb critical race, feminist, and queer theories by giving visibility to individual experiences that were previously overlooked in the gaps between these single-issue topics. To address the concerns of postmodern critics, several measures were taken to strengthen the scientific integrity of this study, however an emphasis will be placed on evoking rich conversation between the interviewer and participant to stay true to the critical postmodern framework as this study is not expected to produce generalizable or postpositivist outcomes (Carminati, 2018). As outdoor professionals, we need to understand the experiences of our colleagues who are marginalized by dominant culture if we want to seriously engage with expanding inclusivity and representation within the outdoor field.     106 Literature Review   I think when you are a professional in the outdoor industry, as a queer person, your story becomes important to be told at so many different moments. I wouldn't say I'm perfectly well scripted in the telling of my story, but I have definitely had to tell it multiple times.  - Arthur  The history of the expedition narrative is often told from a euro-centric point of view, rooted in an imperial and colonial image of the explorer (Hunt, 2019; Xiang, 2018). Symbolic gestures to support inclusion, or acts of tokenism, do not address the social practices that modern outdoor culture was built, nor does it address the systems on which organizations were built that promote and reward hegemonic practice. According to Cox (2001) a common error across the outdoor recreation profession is to discuss diversity without acknowledging or understanding the inherent power dynamics that structure systems of oppression. Structural barriers systematically exclude certain populations from pursuing outdoor recreation through a legacy of discrimination. These social structures are re-created in the outdoors and outdoor industry through the stories that are told, which signals an imperative to dismantle these structures through story telling. Further, it is the perceptions and the bias of leaders in these spaces that reintroduce structural barriers and reinforcing exclusionary culture (Rogers et al., 2019).   Lor Sabourin writes in a July 2021 post for the Outside Magazine article Queer Fear: The Power of Affinity Spaces in the Climbing Community, I had grown up believing the only way I would succeed in the outdoor industry would be to downplay my queer identity.” Sabourin talks about    107 their experience as a transgender climbing instructor in this article. Sabourin goes on to say, “I would be accepted and loved if I could assimilate…. however, I realized how much more fulfilling it was to teach climbing when I was not dedicating half my energy to masking a part of who I am. I rarely discussed my personal journey with climbing, mental training, and developing a healthier relationship with my body, but in an affinity space, it felt wonderful to be vulnerable and share my personal experiences with students…… representation had worked in both directions, I had allowed myself to imagine a life where my identities coexisted, and my community lifted me up (p9-12).   The still very low but increasing number of outdoor professionals who openly identify as LGBTQ+ shows a movement toward visibility, however, we still do not know the relationship between increased visibility and inclusive culture. How do affinity spaces impact culture beyond the group meeting? There is a dominant narrative that goes unspoken in the outdoor industry. Inclusive culture is full and successful integration of all people, especially historically marginalized people, into a community or workplace (Ferdman & Deane, 2014). The word inclusive indicates that people are valued for their background and experiences. Arthur points us to this norm in his quote at the beginning of this section. There are many stories, and many people, who do not identify with or fit the dominant narrative. The outdoor profession limits itself by failing to address this heuristic trap of social dominance.   A River of Intersectionality. No two people are the same and that is the beauty of diversity. Some identity characteristics are socially disadvantaged due to the compounding effects accrued over centuries of oppression and institutional disenfranchisement. Many people have been kept from having access to basic systems of social life like full participation in the economy, politics, or family (Alexander‐Floyd, 2010; Arai & Kivel, 2018; Bell, 1995; P. Collins, 2015). A recent example of gaining    108 access to social infrastructure is the United States Marriage Equality Act where LGBTQ+ families gained protection from government to exist. Some benefit from social infrastructure while some are actively still disenfranchised from social infrastructure today. This power differential is often referred to as privilege (P. H. Collins, 2012; Ho & Chang, 2021; Robinett, 2014). Having privilege in some aspects of one’s life and lacking privilege in other aspects of one’s life signals the complexity of identity in society. The idea of intersectionality has long been felt by people experiencing discrimination on multiple fronts, however, the term arose from employment discrimination caused by General Motors (GM).  In 1976, African American women applying for work at GM sued based on unlawful discrimination (E.D. Mo., 1976). GM reserved clerical jobs for white woman and labor jobs for African American men but had no available jobs for African American women. The workers were forced to choose either gender discrimination or racial discrimination as the basis of their lawsuit (Ryan, 2019). The Anti-discrimination laws at the time did not support the worker’s case against GM because GM technically offered jobs for women and jobs for African Americans. The African American women filing the lawsuit were rendered invisible by the law. The laws in place did not account for the workers’ experience of multiple and simultaneous discrimination, that left these workers invisible to the law. In 1989, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Law Professor, Kimberlé Crenshaw, coined the term intersectionality to describe invisibility experienced by the factory workers at General Motors (Crenshaw, 1989, 1991). Sociologist, Patricia Collins, broadened the concept a year later to how we understand    109 intersectionality today, as a matrix; a single point of multiple intersecting identities that are impacted by social dominance (Collins, 1990).   While Queer Theory was the framework of this project, intersectionality was used as a praxis to identify power relationships that showed up in participant stories.  Intersectionality expands on critical race theory to explain compounded discrimination when an individual has two or more identities that are marginalized in society. The history of intersectional thought is closely tied to political activism. The term was created out of necessity to explain chronic and targeted violence against certain groups of people over others. Namely, disproportionate violence and disparity against African American women and African American transgender women (Crenshaw, 1989). Intersectionality has broadened to include multiple points (or intersections) of oppression, disparity, or inequity by acknowledging that multidimensional discrimination exists, and challenges us to look at discrimination as a system of oppression in society. Intersectionality takes society beyond a homogenous view of discrimination to understand the complex fabric of inequity (Alexander‐Floyd, 2010). Today intersectionality has become a multidisciplinary area of study that is applied across the social sciences. The term intersectionality is gaining notice as a praxis or critical framework to situate social science research. Such application is well suited to study queer topics (Chan, C. D., & Howard, 2020; Duong, 2012). Intersectionality, like other critical theories, is based on both social science and a need to reconcile harmful laws and practices that structure lived experiences.   Outdoor Recreation. The semantics of what defines outdoor recreation is somewhat disputed in the literature. Some researchers believe outdoor recreation is    110 simply leisure activities performed outdoors, while others argue that it is the human relationship with nature that is the essence of outdoor recreation (Emmelin, et al., 2010; Gelter, 2001; Pendleton, 1983). A definition of outdoor recreation that bridges these two schools of thought, leisure activities performed outdoors with the human experience of being outdoors, is best suited to address identity-based questions (Emmelin, et al., 2010; Gelter, 2001). A review of two hundred and thirty-five articles used the term outdoor recreation to describe where, how, and why individuals participate in wild and novel experiences with opportunities for reflection and challenge (Holland et al., 2018). The review illustrated common themes in outdoor recreation activities, providers of outdoor recreation activities, and participant demographics. The most common outdoor recreational activities were paddle sports, hiking, camping, backpacking, and rock climbing; the most common providers of outdoor recreational activities were professional programs like the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) or Outward bound; the demographics with the most unrestricted access to outdoor recreation were white, adult, middle to upper class, heterosexual, able-bodied, and male (Holland et al., 2018; Warren, 2016). The authors noted a lack of diversity in outdoor recreation activities concluding, “[t]his lack of diversity in participants in (outdoor) recreation influences not only how results are reported in studies, but also their relevance for addressing the needs of an increasingly diverse U.S. public (Holland et al., 2018, p217).” The findings of this review are worth noting when considering the impact outdoor professionals working at these organizations have on outdoor culture (Rogers & Rose, 2019; Rogers, Taylor, & Rose, 2019). This goes even further, though. Often the professionals who work at these    111 organizations are introduced to the outdoors and outdoor culture early in life. The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and the Girl Scouts of America (GSA) are examples of notable organizations that set culture by serving youth as an introductory experience to the outdoors. By facilitating these early experiences for people, these organizations influence outdoor culture years into the future.     A Hegemonic History. Outdoor organizations are products of a history of broader social structures that create hegemonic culture. Certain ideologies that have been organized into collective practices like religion, eugenics, genocide, and human trafficking or enslaving have shaped our modern view of wilderness in the last few centuries and must be untangled from the dominant narrative of public lands and their institutions (Mowatt, 2020). These ideologies are exclusionary, destructive, and antagonistic to LGBTQ+ people (Springate, 2016). Because of the existence of broader social structures that create hegemonic culture in society, we must critically examine our history of leisure research to ensure that a dominant presence is not gaslighting non-dominant experiences of leisure and recreation (Finney, 2014). A critical lens is needed to examine the literature, the foundations upon, which our understanding of outdoor recreation is created; particularly how we view our current land management structures in North America (Arai & Kivel, 2018). From collective academic thought to practice in the field, institutions like Outward Bound and the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) train leaders who are dispersed throughout outdoor professions. Outward Bound was quite literally founded as a military initiative embedded in Western European colonialism, while NOLS was created to train future instructors to work at Outward    112 Bound while becoming a knowledge creation hub in wilderness medicine and outdoor education. Both institutions have worked for ten or more years to improve diversity, inclusion, and equity; however, neither organization has publicly acknowledged their history especially in relationship to first nation communities where their programs operate. Western expansion, slavery, and Christian beliefs are the foundation for which our natural resources are managed, understood, and revered today in North America (Christian, 2019). The influence of what that means today is what Bonilla-Silva (1997) described as structural racism. Structural racism is something that is present even when there are no people actively behaving as or actively reinforcing racism or other forms of discrimination. We take what has been passed to us, from the generation before, without questioning how the present moment came to be. We then build on that foundation (of indigenous genocide, African diasporic human trafficking, and persecution of queer existence) as uninformed bystanders and continue the cycle of reinforcing structural racism through hegemonic culture (Bonilla-Silva, 1997; Finney, 2014; Stodolska, Shinew, & Camarillo, 2019). In academia we create knowledge on top of this structure of racism and other hegemonic systems. Critics of structural racism and hegemony have begun speaking out to “dismantle” structures within our prior frameworks instead of building on top of broken frameworks (Finney, 2014).”    The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) is an example of an outdoor organization, heavily influenced by Western Eurocentrism and Christian ideology, that shapes the context of which young people come to understand the outdoors. The BSA has been reinforcing hegemonic outdoor culture and Since 1910. From 1998 to 2015, the BSA sent    113 a message to the LGBTQ+ community in the form of a discriminatory membership policy excluding all members who identified as gay or queer (Johnson, 2015; Eckholm, 2012). The BSA publicly denounced homosexuality as an unhealthy vice, humiliating LGBTQ+ members through claims that LGBTQ+ people prey on innocent victims. Assistant scout master James Dale filed a lawsuit against the BSA after being asked to leave for openly identifying as LGBTQ+ (Hutchinson, 2001; Knauer, 2000, 2001). The BSA defended their discriminatory actions against Dale by likening LGBTQ+ people to child sexual abuse offenders (Knauer, 2001). The Supreme Court ruled in the BSA’s favor for the right to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, which is a signal of the larger systems in place (Bonilla-Silva, 1997). The BSA eventually overturned this discriminatory policy, however, this policy has left its mark not only by excluding generations of LGBTQ+ youth from experiencing the outdoors but reinforcing structural discrimination in outdoor recreation culture (Knauer, 2000).   The Girl Scouts of America (GSA), by comparison, have sought to support LGBTQ+ identities by working to create affirming spaces within the organization and reinforcing an affirming culture in the outdoors (Argus, 2018). Affirming, or affinity, spaces in outdoor recreation is a fairly new concept and practice given the history of perpetuating heterosexism and the potential harm that a heterosexist culture has on outdoor recreation (Dignan, 2002). While not all situations in outdoor recreation can be considered heterosexist, there are structures of heteronormativity that support heterosexuality as the superior identity thus rendering the LGBTQ+ identity oppressed. Dignan (2002, p79) suggests a call to action for outdoor professionals to, “Tear down    114 oppressive structures that we operate within and that operate within us….by acknowledging that the category of heterosexual does not contain us all but does constrain us all.” Some LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals have spoken out about heteronormative structures in their work life experience. LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals have described ways they “manage their identity” in order to navigate their profession and speak about the taxing nature of identity concealment on a multiday expedition (Barnfield & Humberstone, 2008, p35).   LGBTQ+ people have been required to assimilate to a heteronormative social structure in order to engage in outdoor recreation (Barnfield & Humberstone, 2008).The BSA example is one of explicit discrimination and hostility, but more subtle forms of discrimination are pervasive in outdoor culture due to a heterosexist belief that the LGBTQ+ identity is a deviant choice (Dignan, 2002; Hutchinson, 2001). The BSA’s argument of LGBTQ+ deviance is a form of structural oppression, “Power and privilege are maintained through cultural hegemony with struggles over hegemonic control” (Humberstone, 2001, p. 36). There is a struggle to maintain a certain expectation of heteronormativity in the outdoors, which inherently excludes the LGBTQ+ identity.   Summary. The background literature in this section have shaped this study in both research approach and interpretation. Intersectionality is important to the practice or the way this study was designed and implemented in addition to the participants’ experience of intersectionality that was found in the analysis. Also, paramount to developing research questions for this study was to look at research that has or has not been done regarding diversity and accessing outdoor professions. Through this review of    115 the literature a hegemonic history, in academia and practice, was found for the outdoor profession as a general sector.  Methods  The purpose of this project was to collect stories from LGBTQ+ professionals working in the outdoors. The project was designed to capture participant stories. This section discusses the decisions I made to best capture these stories (Flores, D., & Kuhn, 2018). The choices began with requitement and carried through to the interviews and transcriptions. A postmodern approach, to a critical narrative design, requires that the researcher is entrenched in the project. A high degree of reflexive practice is required when a researcher has this level of involvement (Bochner, A. P., & Riggs, 2014; Chadwick, 2018; Creswell & Poth, 2018). I will discuss reflexive techniques that informed the design of the project and continued through to the analysis of findings. The use of the word data in this project refers to participant stories with the assumption that these are unique stories that will not be thrown into a vacuum for comparison.   Recruiting & Selecting Participants. This study sought key informants from the LGBTQ+ community to elicit an informed perspective (Durdella, 2019). As Creswell and Poth (2018) explain, “in a narrative study one needs to find individuals who are distinctive for their ability to shed light on the specific phenomenon being explored” (p. 152). Past or present outdoor recreation professionals were chosen over a general outdoor recreationist as they have a combination of personal and professional experience in the field; that is, they are the individuals who have likely thought the most about the phenomenon under study.     116 I used a combination of purposeful and convenience sampling to find key informants to speak on this topic. I requited by contacting organizations by email in addition to posting on social media outlets. From there, a Qualtrics survey was provided to collect initial demographic and background information. The potential participants physical location, years in the profession, queer identity, cultural identity, racial identity, and sector of the profession where all taken into account. Thirty-six (36) individuals responded to the survey; six individuals were chosen (and agreed to) move forward to an interview. The selection of the six participants interviewed was based on demographic diversity for the study so that the greatest possible variety in participant backgrounds would be represented. This decision was made with consideration of intersectionality as the guiding theoretical framework. Participants in this study identified as: indigenous two spirit, black lesbian, white transgender woman, white transmasculine, white queer, and white gay.   During the interviews, I allowed for an organic flow of conversation with my loosely structured design. Participants often skipped from story to story during the interview, which was a fantastic way to have an honest conversation in the midst of a process that can sometimes feel awkward or intimidating. I developed a comfortable conversational tone with each participant that encouraged a two to three hours interview with each participant. The interviews took place in a protected Zoom meeting room. Journaling was used as a reflexive tool and a first step in organizing what I was hearing in real time. I was able to compare my notes later with the transcripts during my analysis. I also used journaling for more practice applications like a scheduling tool and to provide    117 myself with notes and reminders. During the interview I took field notes to capture my thoughts as reflexive practice, in addition to jotting down notes like follow-up questions as they arose.     This required that I do a bit of editing and rearranging to provide a cohesive flow for an article format in order to show what the participant meant through the telling of their story. There is a balance when editing and organizing these stories as to not overdo it and stray from the participant’s intent. Therefore, it was crucial that the participant check my work and ensure that the stories included where how they felt and where true to their experiences.  Analysis  The participant’s stories were central to the study and were analyzed using narrative data analysis and interpretation; more specifically, a biographical approach to narrative data analysis situated in a critical framework. (Denzin, 2014; Merriam & Grenier, 2019; Creswell & Poth, 2017; Victor, 2009). This approach sought individual stories to generate meaning within the context of societal influences like sexuality, race, gender, and ability (Merriam & Grenier, 2019). I first reviewed each transcript. I then began to pull stories that were on topic with another participant’s story and compared these topics with my journal notes from the interviews. As I analyzed the transcripts and my journal notes, themes emerged that demonstrated the similarities between the participants’ stories.  Trustworthiness ensured the integrity of the study and to protect the personal information of the individuals participating in the study (Creswell & Poth, 2018). To    118 ensure that the data was as accurate as possible, I wanted to ensure that participants felt comfortable to share freely and truthfully. As such, participants were asked to ensure they pick a setting where they felt comfortable to speak freely during the Zoom interviews.  Participants were also asked to review the excerpts that were pulled from their transcript to ensure their sentiment was preserved to serve as a form of member-checking (Birt, L., Scott, S., Cavers, D., Campbell, C., & Walter, 2016).  LGBTQ2SIA+ Outdoor Professionals  I identified similar themes across participant stories. These individuals spoke of the experiences that led them to a career in the outdoors, ambitions for job advancement, the roles that colleagues played in their careers, and their experience of hegemonic culture. Participants also shared an intersectional viewpoint of their experience by describing how multiple aspects of their identity impacted their career in the outdoors4.  Job Advancement  A commonality among these stories was a lack of upward-promotion for those who were somewhat “out” as a LGBTQ+ person and seeking job advancement. The barriers that these professionals faced were undeniable. As a leader in her profession, Kimberly describes the realities of being hired and paid. “I'm a National Geographic Adventure photo contributor and I am sponsored by quite a few outdoor brands. There's maybe forty (40) to fifty (50) of us that are from communities with zero representation in the outdoor industry, who are very  4 More detailed participant quotes are available in the Appendix portion of this paper.      119 vocal and are seen constantly. Even though we have some level of publicity, we struggle to make a living. People seem to think that we're doing well and are always being hired or booked. That's just not the case.” Kimberly remarks on a common request that is made of people working in the industry, to offer services for a bargain, or even free, in the name of promoting inclusion. Kimberly goes on to comment.  “I came out as trans in 2018. It's the same thing with almost every other identity out there from underrepresented communities. As a photographer, I would get these emails all the time from these companies or magazines, and it would go out to almost exclusively straight, white, cis male and be like, “Hey, send us your photos of diversity.” My stories were always told that way. So, the whole idea was to give folks out there, who already had a passion for photography, the support and empowerment to be able to tell their own stories. We talked to the editors of magazines about what magazines are looking for. An outdoor brand help support a climbing certification course that was LGBTQ2SIA+ specific. Out of all the members of this certification course provider, there were very few people who could actually instruct the course because there are so few queer people who are out. It is a really hard place to be out and open.  Being out in the workplace can be challenging due to an unforeseen range in responses from the employer, colleagues, and clients. Responses can range from acceptance to tokenism and termination. JC describes her realization that she would rather not take jobs    120 that have a diversity component to the job tasks. She describes undertones of tokenism that is sometimes innate to asking marginalized people to hold diversity initiative jobs as a path to job advancement instead of being competitive in her focus of choice.  “I actually put in for a job a couple of weeks ago, and I found myself realizing that I don't want to talk about diversity. The job had a diversity component and during the interview I realized that I don’t want to talk about it. I am either good for this job or I am not good for this job. I should not be hired because I check every box. You know what I mean? I have been a game warden for over ten years. I've definitely put in for promotion and thought for the past couple of years I was ready to promote. I wanted to promote. Do I have to do diversity work to promote? Like I said, the last time I put in for promotion was a couple of weeks ago now. With a kid on the way, I'm probably not going to put in for a promotion again for at least the next few of years. I think the time has passed for a little while until my kid gets a little older.”  Each story has a unique approach to how these barriers were interpreted and navigated. Some have decided to leave the profession, some have carved out a space for themselves in the profession, and some have looked for ways to recreate the profession. All remarkable stories of resilience, acuity, and grace. A siren for outdoor organizations.  Roles of Colleagues    121  The impact of supportive colleagues, well intentioned colleagues, and the absence of colleagues were discussed in the following stories. Colleagues undoubtedly played an important role in either the success or detriment to the experiences of participants in this project. This section provides examples of the role colleagues play in a person’s career. Lexi begins with perspective on the past fifty years outdoors. “I wasn't involved in the LGBT community when I got started in the outdoors, but it was almost a mirror being a woman getting started, because there was a minute there were there wasn't a lot of women role models. Though, I had more women role models rather than LGBT role models. So, it was more of an inward journey, I didn't have much support, certainly not nearly as much as there is now. “ Grace discusses the supportive role a close friend and colleague had on her career and her personal life.  “I was leading outdoor programs at the same time I was exploring my queer identity. I really have had limited experience combining those two in any kind of more public way, like being more out... or running any queer outdoor programs. I was more settled in being queer because my mentor within the outdoor world is a gay man. We've never really talked about what being queer in the outdoors means to us either. So maybe that's a conversation we could have together, but... Yeah, he's just super accepting of everyone and provides a very open atmosphere in our outdoor world, which is very kind and warm. It is a lot less structured and just    122 always... You feel more empowered to try something out. That's how I felt as I first started learning alongside him.” Zach’s experience was a bit more complicated to untangle. The same colleague offered moments of support and created hardship in other moments. “The clinical director at the time ended up being really amazing but when I went to her for advice right before I went into the field, she gave me bad advice. I had been on testosterone treatments at that point for five months and I was like, “kids aren't dumb and they're gonna know that I'm trans. What do I say to them? I want to be able to say something.” She said absolutely do not talk to them about it. Don't say anything. That is the wrong thing to do. So, I went into the field and I mean within two (2) hours of my forty-five (45) day shift, the kids started talking about Caitlyn Jenner. I was like huh okay here we are and I can't say anything. This is going to be rough. Finally, one of the kids just asked me flat out and I was not going to lie. The kiddo who asked had lesbian parents. Their parents had been out, and they grew up in the queer community. After that, news spread to the whole camp by the next day. I didn't know what was going to happen. I figured something was gonna happen.”  Zach’s employment was suspended because of this incident. This had a profound impact on his career for several months. All the participant stories mentioned the impact of specific colleagues and general representation in the profession. Many participants were forging a new path, not only at their organizations, but their specific career field as    123 well. The fact there is not more representation is a signal of inequity along channels toward a career in the outdoors. Experiencing Hegemonic Culture  The third theme that was found held the most discussion from participants. Participants described dominance they experienced imposed on them at the organizations they worked, in small groups they traveled, or culture their clients brought to the trip. This section shows quotes from participants, that were compiled during analysis, as examples of the fourth theme, Experiencing Hegemonic Culture.  “My wife always makes fun of me because obviously I’m gay, I’m black, I’m in an interracial marriage; but I don’t really talk about it. Meanwhile she's like, “I’m out here fighting for your ass because you are black and gay and work in law enforcement.” I’m like, I don’t know, maybe that is part of the job, especially as a game warden, to not get into it. So, I know it’s a thing. I don’t know if I am ignoring it or not paying attention to it. I guess it’s so common that I choose not to dwell on it. I’ve even shrugged off everyone calling me sir, but in the grand scheme of things that IS a thing. Why am I a sir and not a ma’am? I am not doing anything to look like a sir to you, but you continue to call me sir. What about me makes you think that I have to be a guy? I’ve never thought about that or cared too much, but if I really step back and think about it…. It shouldn’t be that way. They shouldn’t call me sir. Especially, after I correct them. Do they think a law    124 enforcement officer is supposed to look like a sir? That’s not fair. Little things that we shrug off are actually things that need to be evaluated. JC gives one example of the many small aggressions, or microaggressions, she is faced with while working. She describes a common incident that many LGBTQ+ people face. Not respecting someone by refusing to address them as they have directed you, is an aggressive behavior. This is true for people who implicitly or explicitly disrespect another person. It also signals a culture that allows this type of behavior. Grace discusses the nuance of such culture in more detail.  “I worked with this very well-known organization that is based in a colonial approach to the outdoors. The programs have a very structured way of how they do things, and it's very much... I think a lot of their stuff is kind of based in the military. I get that vibe anyway, which is a little bit uncomfortable for me as an indigenous person, so I've never been super comfortable with their curriculum. Any time I've taught with them, I've been vocal about that, saying that we probably should not focus on the person who started the program and his ways of doing stuff.” Grace points out common issues with the plug-n-play approach to diversity initiatives at an organization. Grace point to the idea that many organizations have: promoting a diversity initiative to hiring and programming without looking at the culture of the organization to identify if it is a safe and comfortable place.    125 “I've only run indigenous programs and a lot of indigenous students, not saying they all do, but quite a few of them bring their own ceremonies or their own sense of how to relate or connect with the outdoors, so that kind of colonial way of doing things doesn't quite fit or resonate with them. I guess there is some kind of ceremonial aspects to practices used by this outdoor organization. One example is the predinner gathering where you hold arms. That kind of stuff. I think this structure can be useful for folks who don't already have a sense of ceremony. I can see why it's useful for some folks in terms of creating community, but what I've found is that it doesn’t really resonate with a lot of indigenous kids. So, when I lead trips for this organization where our students are predominately indigenous, I put the organizations curriculum and traditions aside and then we create our own kind of group. We use instead, ceremonies that are informed by indigenous experiences. The instructors that I've worked with at this program have all been really great and open and receptive to my feedback when I say, “I'm not really gonna teach the regular curriculum.” They've been supportive of it and they seem to understand my reasons why it doesn't quite fit. So that's been good. I've really respected the people I've worked with there.” Grace rewrites the curriculum for the organization she is working for. She does this seamlessly, but it is important to note that she is not compensated for this curriculum development. Grace continues. The other side of this is that the program structure and curriculum does lead to some toxic masculinity... The program has a “beat the outdoors” kind of    126 sentimentality, which is not something I'm comfortable with. One thing they have done that I think they should look at changing is to be more receptive or supportive of queer instructors. They currently try to put one male and one female instructor on each program, and I don't quite see the purpose of that, and especially as people are identifying not as male and female, like how does that work out? So, I think that's something they should look at changing.” Grace discussed in detail during her interview how her community’s culture is matriarchal and how patriarchal-colonialism had traits synonymous with toxic masculinity. She gives an example of a program rooted in military history that tries to serve indigenous youth without auditing their program structure to be culturally cognoscente of indigenous history or experiences.  Findings & Implications  The purpose of this study was to hear stories of how identity has impacted the experiences of LGBTQ+ outdoor professions. Through these narratives, I learned the impact hegemonic culture, colleagues, and job advancement had for these individuals. The overall findings of the study point to the existence of dominant culture that perforate social norms in the outdoor industry. Outdoor professional and the organizations they lead must make a concerted effort to identify and disentangle harmful social norms from their curriculum and practice.  Improving culture  There are many ways to support LGBTQ+ people at an organizational level and approach inclusive practice at an outdoor organization. It is apparent that inclusive    127 practice and LGBTQ+ support are not yet the norm across all sectors of outdoor professions. More research is needed on this topic, however, conducting a thorough review of organizational culture both in the field and at the administrative level is a good place to start, an equity audit. This would include everything from policy review to reporting mechanisms. An equity audit is recommended to identify and confront ambiguity in all systems of operations to improve equity for employees and customers at outdoor organizations (Bowles, Hannah Riley, Linda Babcock, 2007). A review or audit is a crucial first step in understanding the history of how operational practices originated and culture developed at an organization, which is needed before a vision for inclusive practice can be developed and implemented.  The role of colleagues  People comprise the organizations we are discussing. The day-to-day decisions, norms, and language used are determined by the people involved. We must also acknowledge the human aspect of people in the workplace in order to address hegemonic systems at an organization (Ferdman & Deane, 2014). How is success defined and who do we picture as the embodiment of success in this work setting? These are examples of assumptions to question. In Zach’s story, he talks about a colleague who may have wanted to be supportive but was threatened by the discriminatory culture of the organization. An open dialog correcting hateful speech, practices, or ideology may have empowered this colleague to provide better support in that moment.  Colleagues play a role in either supporting or creating barriers for LGBTQ+ professionals. Creating a culture of open dialog, to correct bias as it occurs, is a positive    128 step toward building supportive colleagues across an organization (Lim, F., Jones, P. A., & Paguirigan, 2019).  Job advancement  Stories of being passed over for work opportunities was a strong theme in this study. It seemed that the organization, or the one promoting, did not recognize the LGBTQ+ candidate as being the best fit or the strongest candidate (Chamorro-Premuzic, 2019). Promotion also implies some level of new leadership responsibility for the employee being promoted. This goes back to the assumption of who we envision for these leadership roles. For example, do we picture an image of a large Caucasian frontiersman with staunch heteronormative characteristics as the embodiment of the outdoor or expedition leader? This bias often seeps into an organizations decision making processes (Bond Rogers & Rose, 2019; Lim, F., Jones, P. A., & Paguirigan, 2019; Soklaridis, S., et al., 2017).  Final Thoughts  LGBTQ+ people belong in these spaces. Although difficult to pinpoint, there is undeniably an opportunity gap for certain people working in outdoor professions. You may have heard the old adage, “Success is when preparation meets opportunity.” Some of the stories I heard over the past months pointed to well-prepared LGBTQ+ individuals who stood on the banks of their career waiting for opportunities that never came. This happened while watching others, in some cases people they mentored, receive those very opportunities they themselves had been working toward. Other stories I heard pointed to the intricacies of how LGBTQ+ outdoor guides manage clients who are openly    129 heterosexist. A common theme, though, was how the flow of opportunities toward some people over others seemed influenced by ambiguity at an organization or in a group culture. It seemed that when ambiguity was present, a person or organization, was left to subjectively fill in the gaps to complete a story or draw a conclusion, which may have influenced the flow of resources.   A future emancipatory research agenda would address the topic of ambiguity and invisibility in scholarship to lead to reform; academic reform and practical reform in the field (Parry et al., 2013). Practical reform is important for organizations to revise any harmful practices that encourage hegemonic culture. As we heard from the narratives in this project, this phenomenon is also occurring at outdoor organizations actively working to improve inclusivity and support LGBTQ+ employees and customers, a hegemonic dualism. Also, future research may uncover an array of important topics like a history of LGBTQ+ working in the outdoors or supportive systems for encouraging LGBTQ+ future outdoor leaders. Simply put, LGBTQ+ people belong in these spaces and we are at the very beginning of recognizing the role that LGBTQ+ identities have on breaking down problematic dominant culture in this field (Barnfield & Humberstone, 2008; Bond, Rogers, Taylor, & Rose, 2019; Humberstone, 2001).

This qualitative narrative inquiry was designed to collect narratives and analyze these narratives with a lens that both critics societal practices and norms, while supporting the participants whole narrative. The following questions were addressed: R1: How does a LGBTQ+ identity interplay with experiences in outdoor recreation?  R2: How do additional social identities interplay with experiences of individuals identifying as LGBTQ+ in outdoor recreation? R3: How do LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals perceive constraints and facilitators for people with a LGBTQ+ identity? A strength of narrative studies is the opportunity to dive deep into a phenomenon through storytelling in the context of past and current events (Creswell & Poth, 2018). I collected multiple sources of data through interviewing each participant, journaling my observations, and collecting artifacts. Findings were based on one interview, observations, and artifacts. Six outdoor professionals agreed to participate in the study resulting in more than eighteen hours of total transcriptions from the interviews. This resulted in ample data needed for this project. The interviews took place between March 1, 2021 and April 1, 2021. The professional back grounds of participants included wilderness therapy, professional guide, outdoor photographer, community organizer, game warden, and outdoor instructor. Participant racial and cultural backgrounds included Indigenous North American, Black African American, and White Caucasian.    149 Participant queer identity included gay, lesbian, trans feminine, trans masculine, and queer. Artifacts included magazine articles that participants were featured in, social media posts, and location references about local community or places traveled like information about climbing sites and climbing route names (Wigglesworth, 2021). For a more complete description of the data please see chapter three. Self-Identification & Recruitment  Participant demographic information was found in the Self-Identification Survey. Each participant self-identified specific aspects of their identity as related to demography. The survey was completed in Qualtrics. The link was available for participants to access the survey and to share as a recommendation to qualified participants for the study. Participants who completed the survey but were either not eligible to participate in the study or withdrew their interest before the first interview were not considered for participation in this project.

One participant was unavailable leaving six to participate in the study. All six participant interviews were transcribed by a third-party service and the primary researcher. A biographical approach to open coding was used to understand the emergence of themes within the context of the individual’s entire story. Such coding produced three main themes that aligned with the three research questions of the project identity, community, and profession. These three themes were further subdivided into nine smaller themes, which is shown in the table below.   Figure 2.1 Research Questions     151   Research Question 1  Data collected from all six participants gave insight into Research Question 1: How does a LGBTQ+ identity interplay with experiences in outdoor recreation? Three subtopics emerged in the common theme of identity. These subtopics focused on aspects of the participant’s identity and were categorized broadly as reflections on childhood, the role of the outdoors on early adulthood, and coming out and being out. Participants described identity as an ongoing development, or discovery, that began in childhood. All participants described this time in their lives, formative identity development, either with nostalgia, a deep hurt, or a mixture of both. At some points it seemed difficult for the participant to distinguish nostalgia from deep hurt. Arthur cues us to this when he LGBTQ+ Experiences in Outdoor RecreationR1: IdentityChildhoodEarly adulthoodComing outR2: CommunityEnvironmentQueernessChangeR3: ProfessionCareer pathAdvancementWork culture   152 describes finding out that his kayaking friends refer to him as “Gay Arthur” when he is not around. He felt like this was an endearing gesture, like he was part of the group (nostalgia), but also knew this signaled he was an outsider (hurtful). The participants gave many examples of how they experienced the discovery of their identity, however, their identity stories commonly ended after coming-out and living a fully comfortable life in their bodies. This is where identity focused discussion ended, and the topic of community began.  Research Question 2  Data collected that gave insight into Question 1: How do additional social identities interplay with the experiences of individuals identifying as LGBTQ+ in outdoor recreation? Three subtopics emerged in the common theme of community. These subtopics focused on aspects of the participant’s community and were categorized broadly as environment, queer in a straight community, and changing communities.  Participants described the social communities where they lived and worked. The definition of community encompassed a range of criteria; from remote locations where a participant performed their jobs, communities found at an organization, a single expedition, or the community they built with other queer people or allies found. Each participant started by describing a variety of environments they have been presented with, then began to describe their role in that environment, lastly their global ideas of how the environment and their role in it has changed or might change in the future. This is where the topic of community ended, and the participant began to discuss how identity and community impact their professional experiences.     153 Research Question 3   Data collected that gave insight into Question 3: How do LGBTQ+ outdoor professionals perceive constraints and facilitators for people with a LGBTQ+ identity? Participants answered this question in terms of how they observed and experienced different facets of outdoor professions. Three focuses were found in participant narratives that constructed this theme; path to a career in the outdoors, job advancement, and the roles that colleagues played in their careers. Each participant began this portion of the conversation by discussing how constraints and/or facilitators impacted their path to a career outdoors. A common discussion among participants was of a person in their life who introduced them to the outdoors and entry level experiences for which they could build on. This is an example of one type of facilitator that was discussed, however, facilitators were almost always described as a two-sided coin with constraints. Constraints typically included personal experiences that involved stigma for LGBTQ+ identity or another intersecting identity that has been historically marginalized. Participants also described how constraints impacted opportunities for job advancement. The roles that colleague played were often a mixture of both facilitators and constraints, Facilitator Constraint   154 which were often difficult to parse apart, like nostalgia and hurtful in Question 1. Memories that had both positive and negative attachments were often relationship based. The participant may have had fond memories with a person, but also recalls hurt or bias inflected by this person, so it is difficult to pull those dueling ideas about a single person a part.      155 Discussion  One of the goals of this project was to highlight the uniqueness of each individual story and avoid generalizations. Each person shared a totally unique viewpoint of their experience working in the outdoors. Though each story was totally unique, a few commonalities arose. One significant phenomenon that came across was the amount and frequency to which LGBTQ+ people are bombarded with negative signals that communicate an unsafe or unpleasant environment. These signals included billboards, flags, brand affiliations, songs, gear that does not fit, policies, body language, political affiliations, religious affiliations, and the list goes on. Several participants noted feeling exhausted or using significant amounts of energy to interpret their social environment; trying to gauge if they were safe or welcomed. They felt this detracted from their outdoor experience and outdoor performance. Outdoor performance was extremely impactful for guides who rely on performance to keep clients safe in varying terrain. One of the most powerful actions that came across in the narratives was relationships with allies and with other LGBTQ+ people. There seemed to be power in allies practicing explicit inclusiveness. There was also power in affinity spaces or trips taken in the outdoors with other LGBTQ+ people.    Recommendations for Outdoor Recreation Professions  LGBTQ+ people belong in these spaces and there are many ways to engineer support at the organizational level to ensure inclusive practice. It is apparent that inclusive practice and LGBTQ+ support are not yet the norm across all sectors of outdoor professions. More research is needed on this topic, however, here are three places to start;    156 1) conduct an audit or review of the organization, 2) address ambiguity, and 3) identify performative practices.    Equity audit: Conduct a thorough review of organizational culture, both in the field and of the administration, to identify ambiguity in all systems of operations with the goal of improving the organizations’ ability to provide an equitable experience for employees and customers. This will include everything from policy review to reporting mechanisms. A review or audit is a crucial first step in understanding the history of how culture and operational practices developed at an organization. Acknowledging the past, in addition to recognizing the insidious nature of how the past impacts the future, is crucial to creating an authentic vision and plan for inclusion at an organization.     Address ambiguity: Ambiguity at your organization, or in a work group, describes any aspect of social practice that is not clearly defined but gives certain individuals an advantage over others. These are unspoken values like speaking in a certain tone or dressing a certain way. These unspoken values lead the organization to make assumptions about individuals. The organization might assume an employee is more competent that they are because they speak or dress in accordance with the organization’s bias, while a competent employee is overlooked because they do not speak or dress in accordance with the organization’s bias. Ambiguity directly impacts the flow or resources at an organization (Bowles & Babcock, 2007). These are two examples, however, the ambiguity surrounding value bias is vast and runs deep. Organizations would benefit from explicitly defining any of these gray-areas in policy or practice so that the people of the organization are not left to subjectively draw conclusions that lead to biased actions.     157  Performative practices: Organizations that seek to check the boxes of civil rights regulations, without regard for the people that these regulations protect, lack sophistication in their approach to inclusion. It is important to be explicitly inclusive while monitoring the intention behind inclusive practices at your organization. The intent will drive the outcome in matters of providing an inclusive environment.    These three take-aways combined will guide the organization to make notable changes. Outdoor recreation professional communities should not stop at these three recommendations. Building a better future that values diversity and individuality is a process and a practice that will be relevant for many decades to come. The organizations with the most success will be the ones that continually evaluate their progress toward inclusion with an authentic and critical lens.    Limitations  This study sought to entice the telling of stories to better understand our world. This study did not set out to generalize across a population or field of study, however, there are several limitations which impacted the results of the study. First, the study was limited to six individual perspectives. Six people participated in the study. Second, participant demographic-identity played a role in each perspective. Each person’s experience of power or privilege dynamics, beyond and in accordance with their LGBTQ+ identity, impacted their story. This study reaffirmed that not all LGBTQ+ experiences are the same. Lastly, recruitment was influenced by my ability to send the requitement link to the outdoor professional community. The link was sent to people and organizations I knew about or had access to.    158  I originally thought that teleconferencing would be a limitation, however, the utility of teleconferencing software to conduct interviews was not a limitation for participants during the study. Participants had access to internet, computer devices, and technical knowledge using the software because of the global adoption of these items during the pandemic (Archibald, Ambagtsheer, Casey, 2019). Observational data was limited to what was visible on the computer’s camera however it did offer insight to what each participant chose to show on camera. No false backgrounds were used which gave a personal window into the participants life by seeing them in a comfortable environment of their choosing. Rapport was built quickly as all were familiar with communicating casually over the computer by this point in the pandemic.    Participation in the study was a significant time commitment. Participants had time for one interview. Multiple interviews were too difficult to schedule especially during the pandemic. I adjusted the design of the study to account for this need. The initial interview alone was enough data to include in the study. There was more than enough data from the initial interview. Additional interviews were not needed to maintain three types of data sources (participant, researcher observation, and secondary data). Participants who decline before the first interview were not included in the analysis of the study.  Future Research  The outdoor recreation field would benefit from future research using photo elicitation as a method of data collection. A picture is worth a thousand words and can significantly assist individuals in communicating complex experiences they have had at    159 different points in their life. The photo elicitation technique was introduced as an approach to conducting qualitative research roughly two decades ago (Wang & Burris, 1997). Since its introduction, photo elicitation has been used in a variety of studies throughout the social sciences. Researchers continue to expand the use of this approach (Bates, McCann, Kaye, & Taylor, 2017) The basic premise of the technique is to capture images that express meaning for participants in relation to their experiences with an emancipatory topic. Photo elicitation uses photos generated by each participant as talking points during the interview process. The photo elicitation approach may help participants to locate experiences of oppression during outdoor recreation participation that may be hidden or hard to recall (Meyer, 2003). This approach may also help the participant communicate their experiences using symbolic representation of their lived experience. An example of instructions a researcher might follow to conduct this type of photo elicitation study is provided in Appendix H.        160 CHAPTER EIGHT FINALTHOUGHTS  The final product of this dissertation was shaped by the dynamics of an escape-room-style of game I found myself in my first year of doctoral course work. I will describe that feeling more in depth, but first let me give context. I came to Clemson University to pursue research in adaptive rock-climbing. The Recreational Therapy program is known for its research on recreation-based therapeutic interventions. As I began to interact with the course work, my instructors, and the literature in our field; I began to understand the structural barriers in place that rewarded some people and behaviors at the expense of others. Anecdotally, I also noticed students struggle who were less able or willing to assimilate to dominant culture within the program, while students who dressed and spoke in alignment with dominant culture were given extra time and support. Support and opportunity seemed to be doled-out in alignment with historic margin lines, which is on par with literature discussing attrition and the academic achievement gap (Merolla & Jackson, 2019). I was witnessing this phenomenon among my peers in real time with the backdrop of generations of literature we were reading during our coursework. After I began to understand more of what I was seeing, a healthy skepticism began to develop. My postmodernist view of the world began to take shape, surrounding a belief that our next steps as a society should work toward identifying and dismantling ideologies that do not serve us well. Identifying these ideologies that do not serve us as a human community, starts with our collective understanding and the creation of knowledge, which is why the stories we tell matter.     161  My initial experiences as a doctoral student impacted my experiences working on this project. I recognized gaps in the literature and was concerned how these gaps have impacted the formation of knowledge in our field of study. This was the impetus for this project. I felt a responsibility to pivot my academic focus away from adaptive rock climbing and toward equity when I began to realize the extent to which some people have not been represented in our profession. The stories from each participant that was interviewed in this project have validated my decision to pursue this topic. In addition, I really enjoyed the experience of meeting each participant and them allowing me to step into their world for a moment. Each interview felt very comfortable and familiar. My hope is that the participants view this project as something they were proud to be involved with.   A person has three options in an escape-room activity: 1) Work on the problem, 2) exit the game, or 3) mull around until time runs out. I would daydream about all three of these outcomes at different moments during this project. Ultimately, the outcome of this dissertation is a product of the support network that developed around me throughout this process. I was very lucky to have each committee member take me on. There was also a lot of trust that developed between my advisor and I as we learned to communicate remotely. I was also grateful for the mentorship I received, encouraging me to express myself as I stumbled through the process of developing new skills as a researcher and academic writer. My advisor read many terribly written iterations of this paper and while I thought I was mulling around until time ran out, she was giving me the direction and support I needed to complete this project. The opportunity to try and fail and try again is    162 crucial to the experience of learning. Having the support of mentors who have traveled a similar path before you is a major factor in the creation of opportunity. I acknowledge this in my own experience with this program and hope to use this experience to turn awareness into actionable change.            163 CHAPTER NINE APPENDICES APPENDIX A Self-Identification Survey *This survey will be completed in Qualtrics.

My son on the way, is going to have two moms plus one mom that’s black. There are some areas where there are probably not a lot of people like him. That's something that plays into our decision making. Everyone always asks me if I'm gonna move closer to home since there are more black and mixed families where I am from.”  Queer in a Straight Community “Being queer, in an indigenous community especially one so small… it's just not really talked about…... The younger folks are a lot more vocal about their identity and really upfront about it, and that's awesome. There are a lot of queer folks in our community, but it’s just something that people haven't talked about and I can't speak to their experiences in the potlatch (gift-giving feast) sitting, but I do know I've heard Phase 1: Pilot Study TestMake adjustments as needPhase 2: Conduct Study Data Collection: (recruitment, interview, journaling, secondary data, & fidelity protocols)Qualitative Analysis: (transcripitons, initial review, open coding x2, review interpretation)Phase 3: TrustworthinessMember CheckingReflexivity & Interpretation   171 stories about people not being allowed in ceremony because they identify as such.” A Changing Community “Overall people have this idea that the outdoor community is very liberal and a lot more open and accepting, but …. there are a lot of issues to address. It's still a small movement toward inclusion and equity. There's a lot of friction with folks trying to express themselves, there's a clashing, there's a lot of racism, tokenism, homophobia, all within the outdoors. We are at the beginning of change.”  Table 2.1 Queer Experiences in Outdoor Recreation Category LGBTQ+ identity and working in outdoor recreation Path to a Career Outdoors “I think my experience dealing with horses; how I just took a draw to it and how I just liked it off the bat, is an indicator of my draw to the outdoors. I knew that was what connected me to the job, you know, I knew being a Game Warden was gonna fit my personality, even though the profession was something that I hadn't grown up knowing about. I knew that it would be an easy transition for me.” Job Advancement “I'm a National Geographic Adventure photo contributor and I am sponsored by quite a few outdoor brands. There's maybe forty (40) to fifty (50) of us that are from communities with zero representation in the outdoor industry, who are very vocal and are seen constantly. Even though we have some level of publicity, we struggle to make a living. People seem to think that we're doing well and are always being hired or booked. That's just not the case.” Roles of Colleagues “The clinical director at the time ended up being really amazing but when I went to her for advice right before I went into the field, she gave me bad advice. I had been on testosterone treatments at that point for five months and I was like, “kids aren't dumb and they're gonna know that I'm trans. What do I say to them? I want to be able to say something.” She said absolutely do not talk to them about it. Don't say anything. That is the wrong thing to do.”  Table 3.1 Path to a Career Outdoors Participant Theme 1 Quotes JC “I think my experience dealing with horses; how I just took a draw to it and how I just liked it off the bat, is an indicator of my draw to the outdoors.

I knew that it would be an easy transition for me.” Zack “I had a friend, spring break in our second year of college, she had just broken up with her boyfriend and I just left someone. She had been planning on going to Florida for the summer and asked me to come with her. I was like, fuck it, so we got jobs at a summer camp in Florida together. I grew up in Colorado and loved the mountains. I loved skiing during the winter while I was in high school and two years of community college. So, I did this summer down as a summer camp counselor in Florida…..I hated Florida. It was too hot and gross, so I got a job in California. I wanted to do seasonal work at the time. I wanted to be in the outdoor industry, so I moved to California and worked at an outdoor science school for a year and then I ended up taking some time off to get my Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) certification. I also took some classes at nursing school. Then a friend called me. She was living in New Mexico at a ski resort and I need a roommate. I told her I would be there the next weekend. That's how I got to New Mexico. That's where I worked at the ski resort and that’s where I worked as a wildland firefighter. That is when I upgraded my EMT to a Wilderness EMT. My main goal when I moved to this town was to get on the ski patrol, but when I got there, it was too late to apply. I ended up being a snowboard instructor that season, then worked on a fire crew in the summer.” Kimberly “My father was a photographer as well, so he was always documenting the outdoors. I spent a lot of time from a very early age in the outdoors, and that continued throughout my life. I joined the Army at age eighteen (18) and spent three (3) years in active duty. During that time, I still continued to climb, mountain bike, and do other outdoor sports. When I got out of the army, we moved to a city in the mountains, and I enrolled at the university for a commercial recreation program. I wanted to be back in the mountains after being station in Texas. I started a climbing club at the university 'cause I wanted to meet climbing partners. I also volunteered at a nonprofit that secures access to climbing areas throughout the US, worked at a climbing gym, and interned at a climbing company. The climbing company then hired me on fulltime while I was still in college. I was also doing photography in my free time. My photography kind of took off around 2001. I got my first photo published. So I was working fulltime, volunteering, doing climbing photography, freelance graphic design, and I started writing guide books for climbing. Now I've written five guidebooks to climbing and I am hired to do photography for most of the large outdoor companies.”     173 Table 4.1 Job Advancement Participant Theme 2 JC “I actually put in for a job a couple of weeks ago, and I found myself realizing that I don't want to talk about diversity. The job had a diversity component and during the interview I realized that I don’t want to talk about it. I am either good for this job or I am not good for this job. I should not be hired because I check every box. You know what I mean? I have been a game warden for over ten years. I've definitely put in for promotion and thought for the past couple of years I was ready to promote. I wanted to promote. Do I have to do diversity work to promote? Like I said, the last time I put in for promotion was a couple of weeks ago now. With a kid on the way, I'm probably not going to put in for a promotion again for at least the next few of years. I think the time has passed for a little while until my kid gets a little older.” Kimberly (Part 1) “I'm a National Geographic Adventure photo contributor and I am sponsored by quite a few outdoor brands. There's maybe forty (40) to fifty (50) of us that are from communities with zero representation in the outdoor industry, who are very vocal and are seen constantly. Even though we have some level of publicity, we struggle to make a living. People seem to think that we're doing well and are always being hired or booked. That's just not the case.” (Part 2) “I came out as trans in 2018. And yeah, I was trying to make a living climbing in the outdoors. I did for a long time, but I'm moving away from it now. I don't really see a good future for myself in the outdoor industry, so I'm starting a graduate program in the fall. During the winter, at least before covid, I was going to all the different places throughout the US, and I would teach queer-specific courses, and then women's courses. And then I would always try to do at least one coed mix course as well. Last year, I was supposed to start partnering with a lot of guide services all across the US to do queer-specific technical outdoor programming. I've worked with a lot of my brand partners to do affinity space programs; one brand really supported me and gave scholarships to six folks from different under-represented communities. We brought them out to a climbing area in Idaho and taught them climbing photography for four days. You probably have seen as a queer person, that our stories are never told by our own community.”  (Part 3) It's the same thing with almost every other identity out there from underrepresented communities. As a photographer, I would get these emails all the time from these companies or magazines, and it would go out to almost exclusively straight, white, cis male and be like, “Hey, send us your photos of diversity.” My stories were always told that way. So the whole idea was to give folks out there, who    174 already had a passion for photography, the support and empowerment to be able to tell their own stories. We talked to the editors of magazines about what magazines are looking for. We talked to outdoor brand marketing teams about what commercial companies are looking for. The outdoor brand help support a climbing certification course that was LGBTQ2SIA+ specific. Out of all the members of this certification course provider, there were very few people who could actually instruct the course because there are so few queer people who are out. It is a really hard place to be out and open. So, we got six (6) folks scholarships to participate in that course. Not even one of them wanted to work for a guide service. They all wanted to create their own programs to focus on community building. I want to continue to do that type of work in one form or another, even when I'm in school, but I don't want it to be a career anymore. I'm trying to use my professional experience a little more strategically to build leaders of all types, whether that's in our media to tell our own stories, or within guiding services. So, more folks from our communities can get out there and feel comfortable and welcome. We can start really changing the narrative, who's out there and why.” Zack (Part 1) “That summer I joined the fire department in a part-time role, where I also worked as a wildland firefighter. I absolutely loved working on wildland fires. I was later offered a full-time structural firefighter job, but ultimately declined the position because the chief was a sexist ass. I was female presenting at the time. I was not out at the time, but I got called out as a lesbian by the Fire Chief. I was made fun of a lot at that fire department, and I also felt really uncomfortable there. That is what stopped my firefighting career. I was not interested in being in that toxic environment.” (Part 2) “I am currently leaving a job as a field guide and clinician. I just started identifying as trans right before I came here and had a pretty rough time workwise. My documents didn't match when I applied for this job. I was in the middle of my name change process, so I had to send both documents to my employer. My background check got held up in their Human Resources (HR) department. It got held up to the point that I couldn't go into the field, I couldn’t work, because it wasn't complete. It had been weeks at this point. I went to talk to HR and they said they didn’t know the status only that it was not processed yet. They said they couldn’t do anything. So, later that day I logged onto the state website and saw that my background check and all documents were completely processed. I can't prove anything, but……I was like, “you all are fucking assholes.” I didn’t say that to them because if I call out my job then I'm not gonna have a job. I was down to my last couple 100 bucks. I didn't have enough    175 money to get off the island, so I didn't do anything. I just kept waiting, asking, and being nice until I got the okay to work. After many weeks of waiting to work while living under a tarp at the town park, I finally began working and went out into the field.” (Part 3) “I went to school during this time and eventually was hired on as a clinician at this same origination. I didn't get to negotiate my salary when I started this new role. They started me out at the very bottom as a brand-new employee even though I had been working for the organization for years at that point. Three months later they gave me a 20-cent raise. I worked two years as a clinician until operations were closed due to the pandemic.”  Table 5.1 Role of Colleagues Participant Theme 3 Lexi “I wasn't involved in the LGBT community when I got started in the outdoors, but it was almost a mirror being a woman getting started, because there was a minute there were there wasn't a lot of women role models. Though, I had more women role models rather than LGBT role models. So, it was more of an inward journey, I didn't have much support, certainly not nearly as much as there is now. “ Grace “I was leading outdoor programs at the same time I was exploring my queer identity. I really have had limited experience combining those two in any kind of more public way, like being more out... or running any queer outdoor programs. I was more settled in being queer because my mentor within the outdoor world is a gay man. We've never really talked about what being queer in the outdoors means to us either. So maybe that's a conversation we could have together, but... Yeah, he's just super accepting of everyone and provides a very open atmosphere in our outdoor world, which is very kind and warm. It is a lot less structured and just always... You feel more empowered to try something out. That's how I felt as I first started learning alongside him.” Zack “The clinical director at the time ended up being really amazing but when I went to her for advice right before I went into the field, she gave me bad advice. I had been on testosterone treatments at that point for five months and I was like, “kids aren't dumb and they're gonna know that I'm trans. What do I say to them? I want to be able to say something.” She said absolutely do not talk to them about it. Don't say anything. That is the wrong thing to do. So, I went into the field and I mean within two (2) hours of my forty-five (45) day shift, the kids started talking about Caitlyn Jenner. I was like huh okay here we are and I can't say anything. This is going to be rough. Finally, one of the kids just asked me flat out and I was not going to    176 lie. The kiddo who asked had lesbian parents. Their parents had been out, and they grew up in the queer community. After that, news spread to the whole camp by the next day. I didn't know what was going to happen. I figured something was gonna happen.”  Table 6.1 Experiencing Hegemonic Culture Participant Theme 4 JC “My wife always makes fun of me because obviously I’m gay, I’m black, I’m in an interracial marriage; but I don’t really talk about it. Meanwhile she's like, “I’m out here fighting for your ass because you are black and gay and work in law enforcement.” I’m like, I don’t know, maybe that is part of the job, especially as a game warden, to not get into it. So, I know it’s a thing. I don’t know if I am ignoring it or not paying attention to it. I guess it’s so common that I choose not to dwell on it. I’ve even shrugged off everyone calling me sir, but in the grand scheme of things that IS a thing. Why am I a sir and not a ma’am? I am not doing anything to look like a sir to you, but you continue to call me sir. What about me makes you think that I have to be a guy? I’ve never thought about that or cared too much, but if I really step back and think about it…. It shouldn’t be that way. They shouldn’t call me sir. Especially, after I correct them. Do they think a law enforcement officer is supposed to look like a sir? That’s not fair. Little things that we shrug off are actually things that need to be evaluated.  Grace (Part 1) “I worked with this very well-known organization that is based in a colonial approach to the outdoors. The programs have a very structured way of how they do things, and it's very much... I think a lot of their stuff is kind of based in the military. I get that vibe anyway, which is a little bit uncomfortable for me as an indigenous person, so I've never been super comfortable with their curriculum. Any time I've taught with them, I've been vocal about that, saying that we probably should not focus on the person who started the program and his ways of doing stuff.” (Part 2) “I've only run indigenous programs and a lot of indigenous students, not saying they all do, but quite a few of them bring their own ceremonies or their own sense of how to relate or connect with the outdoors, so that kind of colonial way of doing things doesn't quite fit or resonate with them. I guess there is some kind of ceremonial aspects to practices used by this outdoor organization. One example is the predinner gathering where you hold arms. That kind of stuff. I think this structure can be useful for folks who don't already have a sense of ceremony. I can see why it's useful for some folks in terms of creating community, but what I've found is that it    177 doesn’t really resonate with a lot of indigenous kids. So, when I lead trips for this organization where our students are predominately indigenous, I put the organizations curriculum and traditions aside and then we create our own kind of group. We use instead, ceremonies that are informed by indigenous experiences.”  (Part 3) “The instructors that I've worked with at this program have all been really great and open and receptive to my feedback when I say, “I'm not really gonna teach the regular curriculum.” They've been supportive of it and they seem to understand my reasons why it doesn't quite fit. So that's been good. I've really respected the people I've worked with there. The other side of this is that the program structure and curriculum does lead to some toxic masculinity... The program has a “beat the outdoors” kind of sentimentality, which is not something I'm comfortable with. One thing they have done that I think they should look at changing is to be more receptive or supportive of queer instructors. They currently try to put one male and one female instructor on each program, and I don't quite see the purpose of that, and especially as people are identifying not as male and female, like how does that work out? So, I think that's something they should look at changing.”  Zack (Part 1) “I came out as a lesbian during my second season in New Mexico. It was a little more accepting even though it was a very small ski hill. There were a lot of seasonal travelers; people from South and Central America that came up on a travel visa. I think the only reason people were accepting was because the person I was dating at the time was very outgoing, very loud, very out, very proud, and everybody thought it was hot that two females were together. So, we were accepted a little bit more.”  (Part 2) “I ended up moving to Alaska after a shoulder injury. I saw a poster for ski patrol, so I join the ski patrol there. One of my first meetings there I realized that I was totally accepted by my colleagues. What impressed me most was that my fellow patrollers were very professional. This was not like the dirtbag ski patrol environment I had worked in before. This environment was filled with people who volunteered ski patrol part time but had full time jobs working in other legitimate professions. They knew how to act professionally. I really liked that because I was in school at the time, and it gave me a chance to know people in the community. I stayed a couple years until I graduated. I live in another town now but stay connected to that patrol. “ (Part 3) “I then made a sort of career change and started working as a field guide and clinician. This was the first job where I presented as male. I had the feeling it was not going to go over well when the    178 kiddos called me out as trans. Two (2) days in to a forty-five (45) day shift, the females in the group said they were really triggered by me. That I was standing too close to them and such. Administrative staff pulled me from the field saying I was inappropriate and that I could no longer work there. I had to leave. I tried to tell them I'm not a predator. I am trans. I was in with the program manager and the clinical director when they told me they believe that I am not a predator but legally they can't have me work there.  I felt like saying, ‘This is bullshit!’ but I didn't say that. Instead, I said, “I love this company and I believe in the mission. Please let me do anything any job whatsoever I'll do it.” They said they would think about it. Four (4) hours later I got a phone call from the program director saying they needed help answering phone calls and scanning papers and asked if I was interested. I didn’t have enough money to leave town, so I spent six weeks answering phone calls and scanning paperwork. I know all of the staff and everybody knew exactly what happened. People there used my other legal name (my dead name) when referring to me. I never shared that name so my information must have been shared. Everybody knew everything about me. All my private information. I still showed up and worked. “ Kimberly (Part 1) “Overall, just feeling comfortable is a topic. I have to travel all across the country in order to take photos or to teach. All the climbing areas, the outdoor areas, are typically in conservative rural towns. It can be very unpleasant to go into those towns, even when the climbing community there is great (which hasn’t always been the case). I have had to stop in a small-town gas stations to use the bathroom. I don't know if I'm gonna get attack coming out of the bathroom. When I go into a restaurant after climbing and everyone is staring whispering and pointing. I'm constantly afraid. It's exhausting to be made fun of. It gets so draining sometimes that I can't even focus. I'm scared to death driving in these places that once we get to the climbing area I'm already exhausted mentally and can't climb well. If I do start to shake it off and climb well, then I start thinking about how I’ve gotta go back home.” (Part 2) “I worry about my climbing group wanting to go out to dinner in a small town afterwards, and I really just don't wanna do that. Most people traveling with me, can roll their eyes when they see a Confederate flag or Trump signs on the road everywhere or the billboard out in front of some of these churches with pretty horrible things to say about the queer community. They can just roll their eyes because it's not ultimately gonna hurt them, but for someone like me it makes it hard for me to want to go out and want to be a part of it. On top of that, knowing that when I get to the crag, people are gonna point, stare, and laugh. I've always gotta worry like with my wife, if I    179 can even hold their hand while we're out there. Showing affection, the way any other couple can…. That makes me not wanna be there... A lot of the women I climb with have been really great. But, with guys, even guys who are supportive…. there is often still this uncomfortableness that I get from them. Then that makes me uncomfortable around them too. I just try to avoid that. If I know I have to go on a photo shoot where I'm gonna be with a bunch of guys, it feels stressful and awkward and uncomfortable. I wanna do that less and less...it makes it really hard to focus on climbing or photography or teaching sometimes, because while that's what I'm there for, I have to worry about so much more.” Lexi (Part 1) “It wasn't something that I advertised. I didn't hide it either when... I think some of the challenges were with clients, I had to discern whether it was appropriate to share my truth and my story when they asked if I was married or if I needed to cover it up. And so for me, I think as an LGBT community member, that was probably one of the more difficult things. It wasn't a big deal for my employer, so I didn't hide it and I openly talked about my relationship, but for some of my clients who are much more conservative, it wasn't always comfortable. It certainly wasn't uncomfortable with all of them. I might try to gauge the situation by starting some conversation, get to know them, in order to know whether it was safe to go there or not.” (Part 3) “Then there's certainly clients, when it didn't feel safe emotionally. I didn't feel safe that I could still command their respect. I needed their respect as a leader in their eyes. It just felt like it could have impacted their experience and my experience negatively, so I just didn't go there. And so, for me, that was the biggest part of it. I felt... I've never felt condemned or marginalized by my colleagues, or by my employers. I think I was also fairly well established in my profession when I did have a relationship with a woman, so that might have also influenced it. Most people knew me before I had a relationship with a woman. They're like, “Oh, you're still the same person. So that's okay.” So, I didn't show up in the world of this profession with that label, which definitely is challenging for those who do.”  APPENDIX H Photo Elicitation Example of Instructions Instructions: Instructions will be verbally discussed at the end of the first interview. I will be available to answer participant questions at any point during the photo elicitation    180 portion of the study. To complete this portion of the interview, please consider the following: • Submit 10 - 15 photos that will help you describe what it means to be a LGBTQ+ person in outdoor recreation. • Take pictures of people, places, locations, events, or things that you feel represent best represent your experiences or your observations. • If your photos include a person’s face, please take caution to blur or conceal the identity of the person in the picture.  • Agree to take the photographs using either a phone digital camera or personal digital camera.  • After completing this task, upload photographs to a private Google site using your login. • Photographs must be uploaded no later than #########.

    "abstract": "Objective. The purpose of this project was to learn about the lived experiences of outdoor professionals who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two Spirited, Pansexual, Intersex, Asexual, Plus (LGBTQ2SIA+ or LGBTQ+). In this study, we are gifted with stories that delve into queer identity in the outdoors, with the understanding that not all LGBTQ+ individuals experience the outdoors in the same way. Specifically, this study considers these experiences across temporal dimension of childhood and adulthood, the defining event(s) of coming out, the role of community, and reflections on outdoor recreation professions. Methods. A critical narrative approach was used to promote depth in participant response and to acknowledge the researcher’s role as part of the process while answering three research questions that explore LGBTQ+ experiences in outdoor recreation. Creative Analytic practice was used as method to create a queer space within the work. Six individuals were interviewed in this critical narrative project. Each participant was encouraged to guide the study through their own individual expression (Merriam & Grenier, 2019; Polkinghorne, 2007). Discussion. The data were presented using non-fiction prose as a form of creative analytic process. This approach was used to invite the reader to engage directly with participant narratives within the framework of this paper. The intersection of queer identity and outdoor identity was explored. This study makes way for future research to improve that may seek to support queer identities in outdoor recreation",
