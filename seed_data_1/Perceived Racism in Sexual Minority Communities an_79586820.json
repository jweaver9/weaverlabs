Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) racial/ethnic minorities\nhave faced multiple levels of discrimination from the mainstream community,\nracial/ethnic minority communities, and LGB communities. However, not many studies\nhave investigated the association between intersectional forms of discrimination and\nsociopolitical involvement. The present study examines differences in perceptions of\nracism in the LGB community, sociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic communities,\nand sociopolitical involvement in LGB communities among LGB racial/ethnic minorities\n(N = 203, MAge = 27.25). The sample included 107 (52.7%) men and 96 (47.3%)\nwomen; 41 (20.2%) lesbians, 89 (43.8%) gay men, and 73 (36.0%) bisexuals; 47 (23.2%)\nAfrican Americans, 50 (24.6%) Asian Americans, 64 (31.5%) Latinos/as, and 42 (20.7%)\nfrom another race/ethnicity or mixed race. This study also looks at the association\nbetween perceptions of racism in the LGB community and sociopolitical involvement in\nracial/ethnic communities and/or LGB communities. Asian American participants\nreported perceiving higher levels of racism in the LGB community than Latino/a\nparticipants. No other differences in perceptions of racism in the LGB community were\nfound between sexual orientation or by racial/ethnic group. No differences between\nracial/ethnic group or sexual orientations were found in sociopolitical involvement in\nracial/ethnic or LGB communities. When controlling for sexual orientation, gender, and\nrace/ethnicity, perceptions of racism in the LGB community predicted sociopolitical\ninvolvement in racial/ethnic and LGB communities. By exploring correlates of\nii\ndiscrimination from an intersectional perspective, this study provides a better\nunderstanding of the experiences of LGB racial/ethnic minorities.\niii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nLIST OF TABLES..........................................................................................................................v\nCHAPTER\n1 THE PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE ..............................................................................1\nConnections Between Sociopolitical Involvement and Experiences of\nDiscrimination..................................................................................................2\nMultiple Marginalization of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Racial/Ethnic\nMinorities .........................................................................................................3\nRevisiting Sociopolitical Involvement: Experiences of LGB Racial/Ethnic\nMinorities .........................................................................................................5\nThe Current Study............................................................................................6\n2 METHOD ....................... .................................................................................................10\nProcedure........................................................................................................10\nParticipants .....................................................................................................10\nInstrumentation ..............................................................................................12\nAnalytic Plan..................................................................................................13\n3 RESULTS ...................... ..................................................................................................15\n4 DISCUSSION ..................................................................................................................18\nLimitations .....................................................................................................21\nConclusion......................................................................................................22\nREFERENCES .............................................................................................................................24\niv\nAPPENDIX Page\nA TABLES ................................................................................................................ 27\nvLIST OF TABLES\nTable Page\n1.

Perceived Racism in the LGB Community Predicting Sociopolitical Engagement in\nRacial/Ethnic Issues ........................................................................................30\n1CHAPTER 1\nTHE PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE\nDespite increasing attention in the scholarly community of predictors of\nsociopolitical involvement among lesbian, gay, and bisexual people (LGB) and separately\nof racial/ethnic minorities (e.g., Szymanski & Lewis, 2015; Szymanski, 2012; Friedman\n& Leaper, 2010), less attention has been paid to predictors of sociopolitical involvement\namong LGB individuals who are also members of racial/ethnic minorities. Previous\nstudies have indicated that experiences of racist and heterosexist discrimination are\nrelated to sociopolitical involvement with racial/ethnic issues and with LGB issues (e.g.,\nSzymanski & Lewis, 2015; Szymanski, 2012; DeBlaere et al., 2014; Friedman & Leaper,\n2010). LGB racial/ethnic minorities face racism not just in mainstream communities, but\nalso within the LGB community, which often marginalizes, erases, and/or fetishizes LGB\nracial/ethnic minorities (Bowleg, 2013; Logie & Rwigema, 2014; Teunis, 2007; Ward,\n2008). Studies with LGB racial/ethnic minorities have indicated that discomfort in the\nLGB community due to one’s race is related to sociopolitical involvement in LGB and\nracial/ethnic communities (Harris, Battle, Pastrana, & Daniels, 2015; Harris & Battle,\n2013; Battle & Harris, 2013). However, these studies only use a one-item measure of\ndiscomfort and do not explicitly mention racism in the LGB community as the reason\nbehind this discomfort. Therefore, the current study uses a more detailed measure of\nperceptions of racism in the LGB community (Sarno et al., 2015) to examine the\nconnection between perceived racism in the LGB community and sociopolitical\ninvolvement in LGB and racial/ethnic communities among LGB racial/ethnic minorities.\nAdditionally, I explore differences between racial/ethnic groups and sexual orientation\n2groups in levels of perceived racism in the LGB community, levels of sociopolitical\ninvolvement in the LGB community, and levels of sociopolitical involvement in\nracial/ethnic communities. In this section, I review the literature on sociopolitical\ninvolvement with relation to experiences of discrimination, particularly with regards to\nLGB racial/ethnic minorities. I also discuss the racism and marginalization that many\nLGB racial/ethnic minorities experience in the LGB community.\nConnections Between Sociopolitical Involvement and Experiences of Discrimination\nAlthough sociopolitical involvement can take many different forms, Battle and\nHarris (2013) broadly define sociopolitical involvement as including participation in\n“social and cultural events, particularly those that address community issues and\nconcerns, as well as social volunteerism and activism” (p. 142). Many studies have found\na connection between experiences of discrimination and sociopolitical involvement for a\nvariety of populations (e.g., Szymanski & Lewis, 2015; Szymanski, 2012; DeBlaere et\nal., 2014; Friedman & Leaper, 2010), perhaps because sociopolitical involvement can be\na means of coping with stress related to discrimination (DeBlaere et al., 2014). Rather\nthan being passive recipients of oppression, individuals who belong to marginalized\ngroups can, and engage with, these systems of oppression through sociopolitical\ninvolvement. For example, higher levels of experiences of racism were correlated with\nactivism in two samples of African American adults (Szymanski & Lewis, 2015;\nSzymanski, 2012). Additionally, Mattis and colleagues (2004) found that, among 151\nAfrican American men, daily experiences of racism predicted the likelihood of\nmembership in political and/or social justice organizations. The sexual orientation of\nparticipants were not provided in these studies. However, different studies with LGBT\n3racial/ethnic minorities show a similar pattern. For example, among a sample of 134\nsexual minority women, experiences of racism were correlated with collective action\nrelated to racial/ethnic issues (DeBlaere et al., 2014).\nThe connection between experiences of discrimination and sociopolitical\ninvolvement can also be seen in predominantly White LGBT samples. For example, a\nqualitative study of 15 predominately White sexual minority women indicated that these\nwomen coped with heterosexist discrimination through activism (Pendragon, 2010).\nAlthough they did not measure actual sociopolitical involvement behaviors, Friedman\nand Leaper (2010) found that among a sample of 88 sexual minority women (60%\nWhite), experiences with heterosexist discrimination and gendered heterosexism were\ncorrelated with commitment to LGBQ collective action. Swank and Fahs (2013)\nexamined specific sociopolitical behaviors related to LGBT issues, including voting,\nsigning petitions, letter-writing, attending demonstrations, and participating in civil\ndisobedience. These researchers found that, among a sample of 285 gay and lesbian\nadults (79% White), participation in voting and signing petitions for LGBT issues were\npositively correlated with experiences of economic discrimination and hate crimes based\non one’s sexual minority status (Swank & Fahs, 2013).\nMultiple Marginalization of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Racial/Ethnic Minorities\nMany of the studies cited above focus on only one identity category:\nrace/ethnicity or sexual orientation (see DeBlaere et al., 2014 for exception). However,\npeople do not experience these identities in isolation, and LGB racial/ethnic minorities\nmust contend with the forces of heterosexism and racism (see Crenshaw, 1989).\nAdditionally, the experiences of LGB racial/ethnic minorities in particular are important\n4to study because LGB racial/ethnic minorities face racism in the larger society as well as\nin the LGB community, and heterosexism in the larger society as well as in their\nracial/ethnic communities. In relation to racism in the LGB community, several\nresearchers note that LGB racial/ethnic minorities view the mainstream LGB community\nas portraying the LGB identity as a White identity (Bowleg, 2013; Logie & Rwigema,\n2014; Teunis, 2007; Ward, 2008). For example, in Ward’s (2008) investigation of the\nL.A. Gay and Lesbian Center, “a political and social service organization that had a\nnational reputation for multiculturalism, a growing presence of people of color in\nleadership, and more than 50 percent people of color on staff” (p. 565), Ward still found\nthat the Center was seen by local queer racial/ethnic minorities as a White organization.\nBoth Logie and Rwigema (2014) and Teunis (2007) point out the lack of representation\nof LGB racial/ethnic minorities in both mainstream and LGB-oriented media, which\ncontributes to the perception that being a sexual minority is equivalent with being White.\nTeunis (2007) suggests that the mainstream LGB community uses its close connection to\nWhiteness in order to project “an image of normalcy” (p. 268), which can aid in giving\ncredibility to movements for military inclusion and marriage equality. However, Teunis\n(2007) argues that these movements “do not address the primary concerns of those within\nthe gay community who are non-white, or poor, or young” (p. 264). In this manner, the\nmainstream LGB community makes its racial/ethnic minority members invisible. In\naddition to experiencing racism at the organizational level, LGB racial/ethnic minorities\nexperience racism in their personal lives as well, as many LGB racial/ethnic minorities\nare rejected or objectified by other LGB people due to racist stereotypes of sexual\nbehavior (Teunis, 2007; Wilson et al., 2009). For example, Wilson and colleagues (2009)\n5found that gay Black men tend to be stereotyped as aggressive and hypermasculine, while\ngay Asian men tend to be stereotyped as sexually reserved and effeminate. In their focus\ngroups of lesbian, bisexual, and queer racial/ethnic minority women, Logie and Rwigema\n(2014) found that these women received the message from White LGB individuals that\nLGB racial/ethnic minorities must give up or compromise their racial/ethnic identities in\norder to be accepted as LGB. These experiences of racism within the LGB community\nadd another layer of marginalization to LGB racial/ethnic minorities who face racism\nfrom the mainstream, heterosexual world.\nRevisiting Sociopolitical Involvement: Experiences of LGB Racial/Ethnic Minorities\nAs outlined above, experiences of racism are related to sociopolitical involvement\nin racial/ethnic communities (Szymanski & Lewis, 2015; Szymanski, 2012; Mattis et al.,\n2004; DeBlaere et al., 2014), and experiences of heterosexism are related to sociopolitical\ninvolvement in LGB communities (Pendragon, 2010; Friedman & Leaper, 2010; Swank\n& Fahs, 2013). LGB racial/ethnic minorities experience both types of discrimination.\nTherefore, it is plausible that they demonstrate sociopolitical involvement in both\nracial/ethnic and LGB communities. For example, DeBlaere and collegues (2014)\nmeasured reports of experiences of racism, sexism, and heterosexism among LGB\nracial/ethnic minority women, as well as involvement in collective action related to\nrace/ethnicity issues, feminist issues, and LGB issues. Experiences of discrimination in\neach area were often correlated with sociopolitical involvement with regards to multiple\nissues. For example, experiences of racism were correlated with sociopolitical\ninvolvement in racial/ethnic issues, feminist issues, and sexual minority issues.\nAdditionally, perceived sexism was correlated with feminist collective action, but\n6perceived heterosexism was not significantly correlated with any form of sociopolitical\ninvolvement. DeBlaere and colleagues’ (2014) study demonstrates how intersecting\nidentities and experiences of discrimination can be related to a variety of types of\nsociopolitical involvement.\nOther studies of sociopolitical involvement of LGBT racial/ethnic minorities\nfocus on levels of comfort within the LGBT community (Harris, Battle, Pastrana, &\nDaniels, 2015; Harris & Battle, 2013; Battle & Harris, 2013). The authors of these studies\ndefine comfort in racial communities in terms of the question, “how often have you felt\nuncomfortable in your LGBT community because of your race or ethnicity?” (Battle &\nHarris, 2013, p. 149). Although this question does not explicitly ask about racism in the\nLGBT community, it does ask about the marginalization that many LGBT racial/ethnic\nminorities feel in LGBT communities that often occur as a result of racism. Among a\nsample of 664 Black LGBT women, greater levels of comfort within the LGBT\ncommunity were related to lower levels of LGBT and racial/ethnic sociopolitical\ninvolvement (Harris & Battle, 2013). Additionally, among a sample of 379 Latina sexual\nminority women, Battle and Harris (2013) found a negative correlation between comfort\nin LGBT communities and sociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic issues. However,\nthey found no relation between comfort in LGBT communities and LGBT sociopolitical\ninvolvement within this sample. Harris and Battle (2013) explained these results in terms\nof these women using sociopolitical involvement as a coping mechanism for minority-\nbased stress within the LGBT community.\nThe Current Study\n7Sociopolitical involvement has been shown to help various marginalized groups\ncope with experiences of marginalization, and it also reflects individual’s agency to\nengage with systems of oppression (e.g. DeBlaere et al., 2014). Therefore, it seems\nplausible that sociopolitical involvement in LGB and/or racial/ethnic communities would\nhelp LGB racial/ethnic minorities to cope with minority stress. Although some studies\n(Harris, Battle, Pastrana, & Daniels, 2015; Harris & Battle, 2013; Battle & Harris, 2013)\nhave explored variables that may motivate LGB racial/ethnic minorities to engage\nsociopolitically, they only briefly investigated the marginalization of LGB racial/ethnic\nminorities within the LGB community. These studies only used one item to assess\nfeelings of discomfort in the LGB community due to racial/ethnic identity, and this item\ndid not explicitly mention racism as the cause of this discomfort. Therefore, in the present\nstudy I investigate how perceived racism in the LGB community—as measured by a\nmore explicit, in-depth 4-item measure recently published (Sarno et al., 2015)—relates to\nsociopolitical involvement in LGB and racial/ethnic communities among a sample of\nLGB racial/ethnic minorities. Additionally, I explore differences between groups on these\nvariables since this is a relatively new area of study. In other words, the current study\nfocuses on the following research questions: (1) Among LGB racial/ethnic minorities, are\nthere differences between racial/ethnic groups or sexual orientation groups in terms of\nlevels of perceived racism in the LGB community and levels of sociopolitical\nengagement in LGB and racial/ethnic communities? (2) What is the association between\nperceived racism in the LGB community and sociopolitical engagement in LGB and\nracial/ethnic social issues among LGB racial/ethnic minorities?\n8The first research question has an exploratory aim. I cannot make any hypotheses\nabout differences among LGB racial/ethnic minorities regarding levels of perceived\nracism in the LGB community due to the relative novel focus on measurement of this\nconstruct, and recent publication of the measure I used to assess perceived racism in the\nLGB community (Sarno et al., 2015). I also cannot make any hypotheses regarding\nwithin-group differences among LGB racial/ethnic minorities regarding levels of\nsociopolitical involvement in LGB and racial/ethnic communities. Previous research\nsuggests that African Americans tend to have relatively higher levels of sociopolitical\nengagement compared to other racial/ethnic minorities and that Asian Americans tend to\nhave relatively lower levels of sociopolitical engagement compared to other groups\n(Verba et al., 1995 Xu, 2002). However, it is unknown whether LGB racial/ethnic\nminorities will exhibit the same pattern of behaviors as racial/ethnic minority groups\nsampled in these previous studies. Researchers that have studied sociopolitical\ninvolvement among LGB people have tended to examine sociopolitical involvement with\nrespect to variables such as outness and experiences with discrimination, rather than\ncomparisons among sexual minority groups (e.g., Swank & Fahs, 2013; Harris et al.,\n2015). Therefore, I do not have any data to base any hypotheses about differences in\nlevels of sociopolitical involvement among lesbian, gay, bisexual male, and bisexual\nfemale racial/ethnic minorities.\nFor the second question, I hypothesize that perceived racism in the LGB\ncommunity will predict higher levels of sociopolitical engagement in LGB and\nracial/ethnic social issues among LGB racial/ethnic minorities. The hypothesized\nassociation between racism in the LGB community and sociopolitical engagement among\n9LGB racial/ethnic minorities is based on studies that indicate that experiences of\nmarginalization within the LGBT community are related to sociopolitical involvement in\nracial/ethnic and LGB communities (Battle & Harris, 2013; Harris & Battle, 2013; Harris\net al., 2015). The current study extends this line of research to include an explicit measure\nof perceptions of racism within the LGB community and to examine differences in\nperceptions of racism in the LGB community between racial/ethnic groups and sexual\norientation groups. Since many LGB racial/ethnic minorities feel marginalized within the\nLGB community (Teunis, 2007; Wilson et al., 2009; Logie & Rwigema, 2014), many\nLGB racial/ethnic minorities may cope with this marginalization through sociopolitical\ninvolvement in both LGB and racial/ethnic communities (Harris et al., 2015.)\n10\nCHAPTER 2\nMETHOD\nProcedure\nThis study consists of secondary data analysis based on data collected from a\nlarger study on mental health among LGB racial/ethnic minorities. The study was\nconducted through an online survey on Qualtrics. Participants accessed the survey by\nclicking on the link provided in the recruitment emails sent through listservs. The\nrecruitment email was sent to U.S.-based professional listservs in the areas of counseling\npsychology; cultural, diversity, and ethnic minority psychology; a national Latino/a\nprofessional association; listservs serving graduate students in general and graduate\nstudents of color and sexual minorities. This questionnaire included the following\nmeasures: demographic characteristics; scales on sociopolitical involvement in LGB and\nracial/ethnic communities; Heterosexist Harassment, Rejection, and Discrimination Scale\n(HHRDS; Szymanski, 2006); HHRDS adapted to experiences of racial/ethnic-based\ndiscrimination; Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM; Phinney, 1992); MEIM\nadapted to LGB identity; Brief Symptom Inventory subscales for anxiety and depression\n(Derogatis, 1983); and Conflict in Allegiances scale (CIA; Sarno et al., 2015). However,\nthe analyses for my thesis focus on the following: demographic characteristics, perceived\nracism in the LGB community, and sociopolitical engagement in LGB and racial/ethnic\ncommunities. After completing the survey, participants had the option of providing their\nemail addresses to be submitted to a raffle for one of three $100 cash prizes.\nParticipants\n11\nAdults of at least 18 years of age who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB)\nracial/ethnic minorities were recruited for participation in the study. To confirm that\nparticipants identify as both LGB and racial/ethnic minorities, the first two questions on\nthe survey asked participants to select their sexual orientation and racial/ethnic group.\nParticipants who indicated that their sexual orientation was straight and who reported\nbeing White were not allowed to continue on to the survey and were told that they are not\neligible for the study.\nAfter removing cases of participants who did not proceed past the first few\nquestions (missing more than 90% of the survey), the final number of participants was\n203.  The sample consisted of 107 (52.7%) men and 96 (47.3%) women, with an average\nage of 27.25 years (SD = 7.9).  Forty-one respondents (20.2%) identified as lesbian, 89\nrespondents (43.8%) identified as gay, and 73 respondents (36.0%) identified as bisexual.\nOn a 1 to 7 scale of outness about sexual orientation, with 1 indicating that nobody knew\nabout their sexual orientation, and 7 indicating that everybody knew about their sexual\norientation, participants scored an average of 4.41 (SD = 1.62). In terms of racial/ethnic\ngroup, 47 respondents (23.2%) identified as African American, 50 respondents (24.6%)\nidentified as Asian American, 64 respondents (31.5%) identified as Hispanic/Latino, and\n42 respondents (20.7%) identified as another race/ethnicity or mixed race. One hundred\nforty-three respondents (70.4%) reported currently being students, and 152 respondents\n(74.9%) reported being employed. Educational levels ranged from a high school degree\nor GED to an advanced degree (e.g., M.A., Ph.D.), with the largest percentage (87;\n42.9%) of respondents reporting having an advanced degree. On the MacArthur\nSubjective Social Status Scale, participants ranged through all levels of social class, but\n12\nmost participants (125; 61.6%) reported being middle to upper class. Ninety-one (44.8%)\nrespondents reported that they only spoke English, while 112 respondents (55.2%)\nreported being multilingual. In terms of generational status, the largest group (61; 30%)\nconsisted of participants who were born in the U.S., but had parents who were born in\nanother country. Additionally, on a scale from (0) no noticeable accent to (10) highly\nnoticeable accent, participants were asked to rate in 1 item their response to the prompt:\n“How much do you think others think that you have an accent when speaking English?”\nThe average response was 2.24 (SD = 1.94).\nInstrumentation\nDemographic Characteristics: At the beginning of the survey, participants\nanswered a variety of questions about their demographic characteristics. The first two\nquestions asked participants to identify their sexual orientation and their racial/ethnic\ngroup. This helped to ensure that only LGB racial/ethnic minority participants completed\nthe survey. Additionally, participants were asked about their age, gender, educational\nstatus, generational status, languages spoken, zip code, social class, employment status,\nUnited States residency status, and level of outness about their sexual orientation.\nPerceived Racism in the LGB Community. The Perceived Racism scale developed\nby Sarno and colleagues (2015) assesses participants’ perceptions of the amount of\nracism present within the LGB community. This measure has 4 self-report items that ask\nabout the participants’ experiences and feelings of racism within the LGB community,\nsuch as “I am angry at the way the LGB community treats members of my cultural\ngroup.” Participants rated items on a 7-point scale, which ranges from “disagree strongly”\nto “agree strongly,” such that higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived racism\n13\nwithin the LGB community. Sarno and colleagues (2015) found a coefficient alpha of .74\nwithin their sample of 124 LGB racial/ethnic minority participants and 124 LGB White\nparticipants. In the present study, this scale presented strong internal consistency;\nCronbach’s alpha was .77.\nSociopolitical Engagement. Sociopolitical involvement in the LGB and\nracial/ethnic communities was measured using an adaptation of Battle and Harris’s\n(2013) LGBT Sociopolitical Involvement measure and Racial/Ethnic Sociopolitical\nInvolvement measure. In their study with 379 adult bisexual and lesbian Latinas, Battle\nand Harris (2013) reported internal reliabilities of .75 for the LGBT Sociopolitical\nInvolvement measure and .83 for the Racial/Ethnic Sociopolitical Involvement measure.\nThese scales were adapted in order to focus on specific types of active sociopolitical\nengagement (e.g., attending meeting for LGB groups or organizations) instead of more\ngeneral sociopolitical awareness (e.g., reading about LGB issues). Items for the\nracial/ethnic sociopolitical involvement scale are identical to those in the LGB\nsociopolitical involvement scale, except that “LGB community” is replaced with\n“racial/ethnic community.” Each sociopolitical involvement scale has 6 items that assess\nfrequency of sociopolitical involvement on an 8-point scale from “never” to “every day,”\nwith higher scores indicating higher levels of sociopolitical involvement. In the current\nsample, the LGB Sociopolitical Involvement scale has an internal reliability of .84, and\nthe Racial/Ethnic Sociopolitical Involvement scale has an internal reliability of .85.\nAnalytic Plan\nPearson bivariate correlation analyses were conducted to explore associations\namong study variables. For hypothesis 1, I ran three 4 x 4 between-subjects ANOVAs\n14\ncomparing whether LGB racial/ethnic minorities differ in their levels of perceived racism\nin the LGB community, sociopolitical involvement in the LGB community, and\nsociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic communities. For hypothesis 2, I ran two\nhierarchical multiple regressions with sociopolitical engagement in the LGB and\nracial/ethnic communities as outcome variables.\n15\nCHAPTER 3\nRESULTS\nI analyzed missing data patterns and found that there was some missing data,\nwhich appeared to be missing at random (MAR; Schafer, 1999). I had complete\ndemographic data; however, there were between 7.4% and 7.9% missing data in other\nstudy variables. Thus, to reduce error and to account for missingness, I used a regression-\nbased multiple imputation procedure whereby a pooled dataset was averaged from 20\ndatasets with imputed values that were derived from 200 iterations. I used this imputed\ndataset to analyze the study’s data. Preliminary analyses explored the distribution of each\ncontinuous variable in the study and all study measures met assumptions of normality\n(Osborne & Waters, 2002).\nBivariate correlations were conducted among several variables (see Table 1).\nBivariate correlations for the measure of perceived racism in the LGB community show\nthat this variable is positively correlated with sociopolitical engagement in the LGB\ncommunity (r = .20, p < .05), sociopolitical engagement in racial/ethnic communities (r =\n.32, p < .01), level of education (r = .20, p < .05), and outness as LGB (r = .20, p < .05).\nAdditionally, sociopolitical engagement in the LGB community was positively correlated\nwith higher socioeconomic status (r = .14 , p < .05), outness as LGB (r = .30, p < .05),\nperceived racism in the LGB community (r = .20, p < .05), and sociopolitical engagement\nin racial/ethnic communities.  Finally, sociopolitical engagement in racial/ethnic\ncommunities was positively correlated with perceived racism in the LGB community (r =\n.32, p < .05).\n16\nThree 4 x 4 between-subjects ANOVAs were conducted with sexual orientation\n(gay males, bisexual males, bisexual females and lesbians) and racial/ethnic minority\ngroup status (Latino/a, African American, Asian American, Other) in order to explore\ndifferences in perceived racism in the LGB community, sociopolitical involvement in the\nLGB community, and sociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic communities. When\nexamining differences in perceived racism in the LGB community, the 4 x 4 ANOVA\nyielded significant results [F (15, 171) = 1.71, p = .05]. Specifically, there was a\nsignificant main effect of race/ethnicity on levels of perceived racism in the LGB\ncommunity [F (3, 171) = 3.09, p < .05]. Tukey post-hoc analyses found that Asian\nAmerican participants (M = 4.52, SE = .23) reported higher levels of perceived racism in\nthe LGB community than Latino/a participants (M = 3.49, SE = .25). No other significant\ndifferences were found between racial/ethnic groups. The main effect of sexual\norientation and the interaction between sexual orientation and racial/ethnic group were\nboth nonsignificant. The other two 4 x 4 ANOVAs failed to find any significant\ndifferences between sexual identity and/or racial/ethnic groups on both sociopolitical\ninvolvement in the LGB community [F (15, 184) = 1.01, p > .05] and in racial/ethnic\ncommunities [F (15, 179) = 1.39, p > .05].\nHierarchical multiple regressions were conducted with sociopolitical engagement\nin the LGB community as the outcome variable (see Table 2). Sexual orientation (divided\nby gender) and race/ethnicity were included in the first step of the regression as controls.\nPerceived racism in the LGB community was included in the second step. The final\nmodel shows that perceived racism in the LGB community significantly predicted\nsociopolitical involvement in the LGB community (R2Adjusted = .01, R2Change = .03, p <\n17\n.05), such that, when controlling for sexual orientation and race higher levels of perceived\nracism in the LGB community predicted higher levels of engagement in LGB social\nissues in this sample (β = .18, p < .05). For exploratory purposes, I tested several different\ninteractions between perceived racism in the LGB community and gender/sexual\norientation/race/ethnicity in predicting socio-political engagement in LGB community.\nNone of these interactions were significant, suggesting that the associations presented\nabove did not appear to be moderated by gender/sexual orientation/race/ethnicity (Step\n3).\nA second hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted in two steps\nwith sociopolitical engagement in racial/ethnic communities as the outcome variable (see\nTable 3). Sexual orientation (divided by gender) and race/ethnicity were again included\nin the first step of the regression as controls. Perceived racism in the LGB community\nwas added in the second step. The final model shows that perceived racism in the LGB\ncommunity significantly predicted sociopolitical engagement in racial/ethnic social issues\n(R²Adjusted = .17, R2Change = .20, p < .05). In particular, when controlling for sexual\norientation and race, higher levels of perceived racism in the LGB community predicted\nhigher levels of engagement in racial/ethnic communities in this sample (β = .38, p <\n.05). For exploratory purposes, I tested several different interactions between perceived\nracism in the LGB community and gender/sexual orientation/race/ethnicity in predicting\nsocio-political engagement in racial/ethnic community.  None of these interactions were\nsignificant, suggesting that the associations presented above did not appear to be\nmoderated by gender/sexual orientation/race/ethnicity (Step 3).\n18\nCHAPTER 4\nDISCUSSION\nI had not made any specific hypotheses regarding differences in levels of perceived\nracism in the LGB community due to the small amount of research related to this topic\nand the recent publication of the measure utilized to assess this construct. I found that\nLGB Asian American participants reported higher levels of perceived racism in the LGB\ncommunity than LGB Latino/a participants. Although LGB Latino/a participants may\nfeel marginalized within the LGB community, it is plausible that LGB Asian Americans\nfeel even greater levels of marginalization based on a sense of invisibility and\nfetishization (Sung et al., 2015). One limitation to keep in mind is that because I did not\nhave enough power, I was not able to disentangle if this effect is driven by a particular\nsubgroup of Asian American LGBs within the sample (e.g., lesbians who identify as\nAsian Americans vs. bisexual men who identify as Asian American). However, this\nfinding appears consistent with several studies that have noted that LGB Asian\nAmericans point out the absence of openly LGB Asian American role models, which may\ncontribute to sense of invisibility and perception of racism within the LGB community\n(Bridges et al., 2013; Sung et al., 2015). Additionally, racial stereotypes of Asian\nAmericans may play a role in this sense of invisibility. Participants in a study with sexual\nminority Asian American women reported how stereotypes of Asian Americans as\npassive lead to invisibility in general, such that “just being Asian, you’re not really\nnoticed” (Alimahomed, 2010, p. 159). Further studies comparing the experiences of LGB\nracial/ethnic minority groups to each other must be conducted in order to better\nunderstand the experiences of each group.\n19\nAdditionally, due to the small amount of research related to sociopolitical\ninvolvement of LGB racial/ethnic minorities, I had not made any specific hypotheses\nregarding differences among racial/ethnic and/or sexual identity groups in sociopolitical\ninvolvement in racial/ethnic and/or LGB communities. However, previous research has\nindicated that African Americans tend to have higher levels of sociopolitical engagement\nthan other racial/ethnic minorities (Verba et al., 1995) and that Asian Americans tend to\nhave the lowest levels of sociopolitical engagement of all racial/ethnic groups (Xu, 2002).\nDespite these differences in groups noted in the literature, no such differences were\nobserved in this sample. This may reflect different patterns of sociopolitical involvement\namong LGB racial/ethnic minorities, compared to predominantly heterosexual\nracial/ethnic minority groups. Experiences of marginalization related to multiple aspects\nof one’s identities may lead LGB individuals of various racial/ethnic minority groups to\nengage in levels of sociopolitical involvement that are perhaps higher when compared to\nindividuals who do not have to contend with multiple forms of marginalization. However,\nit is also possible that this pattern only reflects the characteristics of the current sample\n(e.g., individuals who are more inclined to social and political participation were more\nlikely to complete our survey), and caution must be made when attempting to generalize\nthis pattern to all LGB racial/ethnic minorities. Just as there were no differences between\nrace/ethnicity on the measures of sociopolitical involvement, there were no differences\nbetween sexual orientation groups. Unfortunately, there is limited literature on examining\ndifferences among sexual orientation subgroups in sociopolitical involvement with which\nwe can compare our findings. Existing studies have tended to focus on other indicators of\n20\nwithin-group differences, such as levels of outness or experiences with heterosexism\n(e.g., Swank & Fahs, 2013; Harris et al., 2015).\nAs hypothesized, perceived racism in the LGB community predicted\nsociopolitical engagement in both the LGB community and racial/ethnic communities,\nafter controlling for sexual orientation, gender, and race/ethnicity. These results\ncorrespond with other studies that have indicated that discomfort in the LGB community\ndue to one’s race is related to sociopolitical involvement among LGB racial/ethnic\nminorities (Harris et al., 2015; Harris & Battle, 2013; Battle & Harris, 2013). These\nresults suggest that this discomfort in the LGB community cited in other studies may\nreflect perceptions of racism in the LGB community. Although the current study cannot\nshow a causal or directional relation between perceived racism in the LGB community\nand sociopolitical involvement in LGB and racial/ethnic communities, it is possible that\nLGB racial/ethnic minorities cope with the racism that they face in the LGB community\nthrough sociopolitical involvement in LGB and racial/ethnic communities. LGB\nracial/ethnic minorities who report high levels of racism in the LGB community may\nreact to this racism by further engaging in antiracist efforts as well as making changes\nwithin the LGB community. These results also correspond with the finding that\nexperiences of racism in general are associated with higher levels of collective action\nabout racial/ethnic issues and about sexual minority issues among LGB racial/ethnic\nminority women (DeBlaere et al., 2014). These results reflect the multiple, intersecting\nforms of marginalization that LGB racial/ethnic minorities face and how LGB\nracial/ethnic minorities cope with these intersecting forms of marginalization. Rather than\nsolely focus on LGB sociopolitical involvement or racial/ethnic sociopolitical\n21\ninvolvement, LGB racial/ethnic minorities who reported higher levels of racism in the\nLGB community also reported being involved in both LGB and racial/ethnic issues.\nLimitations\nThere are limitations to consider when interpreting the findings from the present\nstudy. Since many study participants were recruited through emails to listservs targeted to\nprofessionals, the sample consisted of a large percentage of people with graduate or\nprofessional degrees. Although 42.9% of the sample reported having an advanced degree,\nabout 10.3% of the United States population aged 25 or older has a graduate or\nprofessional degree (Ogunwole, Drewery, Jr., & Rios-Vargas, 2012). Therefore, the\ncurrent study is not generalizable to all LGB racial/ethnic minorities, but focuses on the\nexperiences of LGB racial/ethnic minorities with higher educational levels and\nsocioeconomic statuses. Secondly, cell sizes in the 4 x 4 ANOVAs were relatively small,\nreducing the statistical power of these tests. In order to retain some power, racial/ethnic\ngroups with relatively small levels of participation, such as Native American and\nmultiracial participants, were combined into the “Other racial/ethnic group” category.\nAlso, due to a lack of sufficient statistical power, analyses that combined racial/ethnic\nand sexual orientation group (e.g. gay Latino men, bisexual Asian Americans) were not\nconducted. Future studies on LGB racial/ethnic minorities should include more\nparticipants in order to increase cell sizes and allow for analysis by both racial/ethnic and\nsexual orientation group concurrently. Finally, due to the cross sectional design of this\nstudy, the causal direction between variables cannot be determined. It is possible that\nperceptions of racism in the LGB community lead to sociopolitical involvement in LGB\nand racial/ethnic communities, or that sociopolitical involvement in LGB and\n22\nracial/ethnic communities makes racism in the LGB community more salient to\nindividuals. It is also possible that the relation between perceived racism in the LGB\ncommunity and sociopolitical involvement in LGB and racial/ethnic communities is\nbidirectional and that other variables are involved. In order to further understand the\nrelation between perceived racism in the LGB community and sociopolitical involvement\nin LGB and racial/ethnic communities, researchers should study potential moderating\nvariables and use longitudinal study designs.\nConclusion\nThe present study adds to the literature on sociopolitical involvement among LGB\nracial/ethnic minorities by investigating how perceived racism within the LGB\ncommunity predicts sociopolitical involvement in both LGB and racial/ethnic\ncommunities. Additionally, intragroup differences among LGB racial/ethnic minorities\nwere assessed in perceived racism in the LGB community, sociopolitical involvement in\nthe LGB community, and sociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic communities.\nSpecifically, we found that LGB Asian Americans in our sample reported higher levels of\nperceived racism in the LGB community than LGB Latinos/as in our sample. However,\nwe found no differences between racial/ethnic groups or sexual minority groups on\nsociopolitical involvement in LGB or racial/ethnic communities. We also found that\nperceptions of racism in the LGB community predict sociopolitical involvement in both\nLGB and racial/ethnic communities, after controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, and\nsexual orientation. Due to the heterogeneity of LGB racial/ethnic minorities, further\nresearch on intragroup similarities and differences must be conducted in order to provide\na fuller picture of the experiences of LGB racial/ethnic minorities. Additionally, the\n23\ndirectional relationships between perceptions of racism in the LGB community and\nsociopolitical involvement should be investigated in future studies. With a better\nunderstanding of the experiences of LGB racial/ethnic minorities, LGB-focused\norganizations and racial/ethnic group-focused organizations can better adapt to the needs\nof LGB racial/ethnic minorities.\n24\nREFERENCES\nAlimahomed, S.

    "abstract": "abstract: Sociopolitical involvement has been previously shown to be associated with experiences of discrimination. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) racial/ethnic minorities have faced multiple levels of discrimination from the mainstream community, racial/ethnic minority communities, and LGB communities. However, not many studies have investigated the association between intersectional forms of discrimination and sociopolitical involvement. The present study examines differences in perceptions of racism in the LGB community, sociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic communities, and sociopolitical involvement in LGB communities among LGB racial/ethnic minorities (N = 203, MAge = 27.25). The sample included 107 (52.7%) men and 96 (47.3%) women; 41 (20.2%) lesbians, 89 (43.8%) gay men, and 73 (36.0%) bisexuals; 47 (23.2%) African Americans, 50 (24.6%) Asian Americans, 64 (31.5%) Latinos/as, and 42 (20.7%) from another race/ethnicity or mixed race. This study also looks at the association between perceptions of racism in the LGB community and sociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic communities and/or LGB communities. Asian American participants reported perceiving higher levels of racism in the LGB community than Latino/a participants. No other differences in perceptions of racism in the LGB community were found between sexual orientation or by racial/ethnic group. No differences between racial/ethnic group or sexual orientations were found in sociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic or LGB communities. When controlling for sexual orientation, gender, and race/ethnicity, perceptions of racism in the LGB community predicted sociopolitical involvement in racial/ethnic and LGB communities. By exploring correlates of discrimination from an intersectional perspective, this study provides a better understanding of the experiences of LGB racial/ethnic minorities.Dissertation/ThesisMasters Thesis Counseling Psychology 201",
