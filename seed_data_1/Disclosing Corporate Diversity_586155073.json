Diversity disclosures are important not only for shareholders’ interests in transparency, but also for the benefit of other stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the communities in which companies operate, who want to know whether companies are diverse to determine where to work, what brands to buy, and what companies value. The literature has yet to explore the significance of diversity disclosures for the benefit of all these stakeholders. This Article argues that legal reform is needed to use disclosures to improve corporate diversity for the benefit of all stakeholders.

This Article defines corporate diversity as the representation and inclusion of employees, management, and board members in a company, by gender, race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ status, and disability, and the provision of equal employment opportunity.  This Article makes three claims. The first is that disclosures can be used instrumentally to diversify corporate boardrooms and workplaces. The second is that while diversity disclosures are important for shareholders who want to know about diversity in the companies in which they invest, other stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, customers, community members, advocacy groups of various types, activists, reformers, and the public as a whole,3 are also interested in  1 ESG, which has its origins in the United Nations’ environmental movement, is about integrating environmental, social, and governance issues into business. For an excellent discussion about the origins and ambiguity around the term ESG, see Elizabeth Pollman, The Making and Meaning of ESG 20–29 (Inst. L. & Econ., Working Paper No. 659, 2022).  2 Thompson Hine, An ESG Snapshot: Survey Confirms Companies Are Responding to Increasing Expectations 5 (2021), https://admin.thompsonhine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/An_ESG_Snapshot.pdf [https://perma.cc/VHV7-9SE8].

The literature has yet to explore the importance of corporate diversity disclosures to these other stakeholders. The third is that legislative reform is needed for disclosures to be used as an instrument to increase corporate diversity. The Article makes theoretical, empirical, and policy contributions in relation to these claims. Theoretically, it brings the ESG and corporate diversity literatures together for the first time. ESG is about the role of business in society, particularly whether and how companies consider the public interest in their practices and policies.4  Scholars have long written about Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) and ESG, and corporate diversity as two separate subjects.5 CSR and ESG scholarship can be traced to the 1930s debate between Columbia Law School’s Adolph Berle and Harvard Law School’s Merrick Dodd.6 Berle described the protection of shareholders as the critical challenge facing corporate law.7 Dodd focused on the power dynamics between corporations and society and argued that corporate managers should be attentive not just to shareholders, but to other stakeholders.8 This debate crystallized in the 1970s—at a similar moment as the environmental movement sought to mitigate ecological harm caused by certain corporate practices—with Milton Friedman’s proclamation that managers should act primarily in the interest of shareholders rather than other  https://www.emarketer.com/content/consumers-expect-brands-inclusive [https://perma.cc/DM29-8H9G]; Juliana Menasce Horowitz, Americans See Advantages and Challenges in Country’s Growing Racial and Ethnic Diversity, Pew Rsch.

Empirically, this Article shows that, at least in the last five years, public companies have firmly integrated diversity disclosures in their ESG reports. This Article uses machine-learning techniques to analyze 3,461 ESG reports for 1,288 Russell 3000 index companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) for the five-year period from 2017 to 2021.

COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 2023] Disclosing Corporate Diversity 313 In terms of policy, this Article makes the case for using disclosures instrumentally to bring about change that would benefit all stakeholders through new legislation. This Article addresses the limitations of emerging attempts to mandate diversity disclosures, particularly by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Since the 1960s and 1970s, companies have grappled with whether and how to disclose their CSR and ESG policies and practices that impact shareholders, other stakeholders, and society.18 Scholars and other commentators have since debated whether the SEC has the authority to require the disclosure of ESG practices.19 Even as academic debates have continued, however, corporations began to voluntarily disclose their CSR and ESG reports as early as the 1990s, largely because of shareholder pressure for transparency and information.20  In August 2021, the SEC approved Nasdaq’s rule requiring companies listed on its exchange to disclose the diversity of their boards pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , and Rule 19b-4,21 making it the first-ever ESG disclosure mandate. While the rule is an important start to mandating diversity disclosures, the SEC is limited in its authority to use disclosures for social change. This limitation is evidenced by three features of the Nasdaq/SEC rule. First, the rule requires Nasdaq-listed companies to have two diverse board members—at least one director who self‑identifies as female and at least one director  18 See infra Section I.C and accompanying text. 19 See generally Williams, supra note 16, at 1205–07 (arguing that the SEC has the authority to require expanded disclosure and should use this authority to ensure “corporate social transparency”); Stevenson, supra note 16, at 58–62 (explaining and rebutting the SEC’s reluctancy to use its authority to require the disclosure of policies related to social goods); Branson, supra note 16, at 631–34 (discussing Judge Charles Richey’s perspective on the SEC’s authority to require social responsibility disclosure); Sonde & Pitt, supra note 16, at 835–36 (discussing the SEC’s opportunity to “help promote the nation’s environmental policy” through disclosure requirements related to the National Environmental Policy Act); Paul G.

The SEC states that, “[w]hile the proposal may have the effect of encouraging some Nasdaq-listed companies to increase diversity on their boards, the proposed rules do not mandate any particular board composition.”23 Therefore, the rule advances shareholder transparency but stops short of using disclosures to increase board diversity. Second, the rule applies only to boards and would not require the disclosure of employee or executive diversity, which significantly limits its reach. Third, it only applies to public companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange; it does not apply to companies listed on other exchanges or private companies with large valuations that are like public companies, thereby omitting a large subset of the economy.  This Article argues that Congress should step in to establish a diversity disclosure obligation that can increase diversity in both public and private companies. The United States House of Representatives recently passed the ESG Disclosure Simplification Act of 2021 (“ESG Disclosure Act”),24 which would require companies to disclose their ESG matters, including employee and board diversity.25 While the proposed ESG Disclosure Act is a significant step toward mandating diversity disclosures for  22 Underrepresented minority is defined as identifying as Black (or African American), Latinx, Asian, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or a combination of multiple of these ethnicities; LGBTQ+ is defined as an individual who “self-identifies as any of the following: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or as a member of the queer community.” Order Approving Changes to Listing Rules Related to Board Diversity, 86 Fed.

This Article proceeds in four parts. Part I discusses the scholarship on CSR and ESG, the history of movements to make CSR and ESG disclosures mandatory, and the history of voluntary ESG disclosures. Part II discusses contemporary law, policy, and private ordering around diversity disclosures, including the recent Nasdaq/SEC rule mandating diversity disclosures and Congress’s attempt to mandate diversity disclosures in the ESG Disclosure Act. Part III describes the data and methods used for analysis and empirically shows that diversity disclosures are already firmly included in ESG reports. Part IV analyzes the shortcomings of the Nasdaq/SEC and legislative approaches, arguing that because the purpose of securities laws is limited to ensuring transparency for shareholders to make investment decisions, it is imperative to have a comprehensive disclosure regime that can be used to improve board and workplace diversity rather than to merely provide transparency or serve other shareholder interests. Part IV then proposes a comprehensive disclosure legislation that includes statistical information and forward-looking provisions that aim to gradually increase corporate diversity to benefit a broader range of stakeholders. It also discusses the role of shareholder and employee activists as mechanisms to pressure companies to improve diversity under both the proposed regime and the current Nasdaq/SEC “disclose or explain” rule.  I. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURES Environmental, Social, and Governance activities and Corporate Social Responsibility are about the role of business in society, which has long been debated in academic writing.27 The premise is that corporations have obligations to various stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, community members, advocacy groups of various types, and the public.28 These stakeholders often base their investment  26 See Atinuke O.

A. Scholarship on ESG Until recently, scholarship on ESG was largely devoid of discussions about corporate diversity, and scholarship on corporate diversity also mostly lacked the ESG framework, which tends to emphasize disclosures. There are generally two areas of traditional CSR and ESG scholarship. The first area is more limited, treating CSR as mainly synonymous with corporate philanthropy.31 The second strand of scholarship focuses on ESG and related disclosures as mostly about environmental and sustainability concerns.32 In both strands, diversity was often  29 See Lucian A.

Diversity scholarship tends to fall into two categories. The first is scholarship that addresses the rationales for—and benefits and drawbacks of—diversifying corporations.37 The second is the more recent scholarship that uses the ESG framework and addresses disclosures in the context of corporate diversity.38 This Article joins this rapidly growing literature that discusses diversity disclosures in the context of ESG. The Article then pushes the literature further with an original empirical analysis that shows how corporations have shifted ESG disclosures to include diversity disclosures in the last five years.

History of Mandatory CSR Disclosures When the environmental and consumer movement of the 1970s began, civil rights matters were included as part of the push for mandatory CSR disclosures. At the time, CSR disclosures focused on equal employment opportunity for racial and ethnic minorities and did not include the disclosure of gender and other identities. In the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, fair employment became part of the criteria used to evaluate CSR.40 In 1970, the consumer movement on corporate social responsibility made several appeals for mandating the disclosure of environmental and civil rights matters.41  In 1971, the Natural Resources Defense Council (“NRDC”), Project on Corporate Responsibility (“the Project”), and the Center on Corporate Responsibility (“the Center”) filed a rulemaking petition with the SEC requesting that it amend its reporting rules to require corporations to disclose more information about the environmental impact of their activities and their progress in achieving equity.42 Regarding environmental disclosures, the proposal wanted the SEC to require companies “to describe with respect to each major activity or product . . . : (1) the nature and extent . . . of the resulting pollution or injury to natural areas and resources, and (2) the feasibility of, and plans for, correcting the same.”43 “The [p]etition also requested that the SEC require disclosure of whether the registered company has changed company products, projects, production methods, policies, investments or advertising to advance  39 See Brest & Honigsberg, supra note 34, at 93; Brummer & Strine, supra note 38, at 25–26. 40 Stacy Kinlock Sewell, “The Best Man for the Job”: Corporate Responsibility and Racial Integration in the Workplace, 1945–1960, 65 Historian 1125, 1125 (2003); Archie B.

It first issued a release simply describing its limited policies on environmental and civil rights disclosures. [T]he Securities and Exchange Act call[s] for disclosure, if material, when compliance with statutory requirements with respect to environmental quality e.g., various air, water and other antipollution laws, may necessitate significant capital outlays, may materially affect the earning power of the business, or cause material changes in . . . business . . . .  [And these requirements] call for disclosure, if material, when legal proceedings arising under statutory requirements relating to Civil Rights would for example, result in the cancellation of a Government contract or termination of further business with the Government.47 Next, in December 1971, the SEC issued an order stating that it “declined to take the action requested” by the petitioners.48 Without providing much reasoning, the SEC appeared to have decided that “no reasonable investor . . . want[ed] the type of information” sought.49 The letter informing the petitioners of the order also stated that the SEC would “actively consider” amendments to its disclosure requirements “in the near future,”50 but no meaningful changes came. In April 1973, the SEC passed amendment Forms S-I, S-7, and S-9 (for registration of new issues under the 1933 Act), Form 10 (for registration under the 1934 Act), Form 10-K (for annual reports under the 1934 Act), and Form 8-K (for  44 Id. 45 Id. 46 Environmental Disclosure Rules: Despite Court Win, SEC Adopts Broad New Standard for Corporations, 9 Env’t L.

SEC (“NRDC I”), the district court concluded that the SEC failed to deliver “an informed and reasoned consideration of the changes . . . it should [have] effect[ed]” after the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”) passed.56 The court then remanded with instructions that fuller proceedings be conducted and issued instructions for the SEC to explore possible avenues that can “eliminate corporate practices that are inimical to the environment and equal employment opportunity.”57 On remand, the SEC issued a release giving notice of renewed proceedings to fulfill the district court’s instructions.58 In nineteen days of public hearings, there were fifty-four oral presentations and 353 written comments.59 Comments favoring the proposals declared that greater disclosure was essential considering what the disclosed information would show about environment and equal employment costs.60  51 Disclosure with Respect to Compliance with Environmental Requirements and Other Matters, 38 Fed.

In Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC (“NRDC II”), the district court held that although NEPA did not require the SEC to promulgate broad environmental disclosure regulations, the SEC was required to consider alternatives to the fullest extent possible.63 Finding that the SEC failed to do so, the court remanded the case back to the commission once more.64 But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.65 The D.C. Circuit emphasized Congress’s discretion in granting the SEC power to develop disclosure rules, acknowledging that judicial review must be deferential to the extent of relying to some degree on the agency’s expertise.66 The court of appeals held that the Commission was “wholly justified in rejecting the proposed rules and choosing” to rely on its existing disclosure standard that rests on the materiality of information to investors.67 The materiality standard contemplates  a showing of a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable shareholder . . . .

Item 101 of Regulation S-K requires companies to “disclos[e] . . . certain costs of complying with environmental laws.”72 Item 101 also requires disclosure of “any material estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder of a [company]’s current fiscal year and its succeeding fiscal year and for such further periods as the [company] may deem material.”73 Item 103 of Regulation S-K also requires companies to disclose environmental penalties of $100,000 or greater.74 The rule requires the disclosure of material pending administrative or judicial proceedings, other than “ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business.”75 In November 2020, the SEC updated the rule to increase the existing quantitative threshold from $100,000 to $300,000 but also allow companies to choose from a range of different thresholds that they determine is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of material environmental proceedings.76   69 George S.

History of Voluntary CSR and ESG Disclosures Unlike the mandatory disclosure movement, the voluntary disclosure of equal employment opportunity and environmental disclosures were separate from the very beginning. In April 1961, the NAACP filed complaints with the President’s Committee on Equal Opportunity Employment about discrimination against Black employees at Lockheed Martin Corporation’s aircraft plant in Marietta, Georgia.77 The plant in Marietta “was a segregated facility, and the small number of existing [B]lack employees were concentrated in low-level jobs.”78 After the NAACP filed its complaint, the Commission’s Executive Director, John Field, “flew to Lockheed’s headquarters in California to meet with [the] company[’s] president Courtlandt Gross to try to persuade him to take strong steps to resolve the complaints.”79 In response, “Lockheed immediately removed ‘White’ and ‘Colored’ signs from rest rooms, drinking fountains, and cafeterias at the . . . plant.”80 Then, “[i]n a ceremony on May 25, 1961, Gross and [then] Committee Chair Lyndon Johnson formally agreed to what they called a ‘Plan for Progress,’ ” which was conceived to enlist voluntary cooperation from large companies to fight racial discrimination, as well as create equal employment, training, and promotion for minority employees.81 President Kennedy “hailed it as a ‘milestone’ in civil rights, asserting that it was ‘setting a pattern’ for voluntary action in achieving equal employment opportunity.”82 By 1966, there were 328 signatories—some of the largest corporations in the country—who provided the Committee with aggregated employment statistics.83 However, this aggregated data  77 Judson MacLaury, President Kennedy’s E.O. 10925: Seedbed of Affirmative Action, 2 J.

However, company-level data is not publicly disclosed.87 It is only in voluntary disclosures that companies provide that information to the public. II.

Diversity Disclosures in Securities Laws  Similar to environmental disclosures that already have some limited disclosure mandates in securities laws, in 2009, the SEC adopted a rule—Item 407(c) of Regulation S-K—requiring companies to disclose whether and how they consider diversity in identifying director nominees.106 But the rule does not require firms to adopt policy regarding the consideration of diversity in their nomination processes. The SEC only requires a company to explain how its policy is implemented and how its boards assess the policy’s effectiveness.107 Nor does the SEC provide a definition of diversity. Instead, it allows companies to define it as expansively as to include differences of viewpoint, professional experience, education, skill, and other individual qualities, or as narrowly as to focus on concepts such as race or gender.108 Ultimately, the rule does not require firms to adopt a diversity policy at all.109 And, until 2021, this was the only diversity disclosure rule on the books, meaning there were no mandated statistical disclosures or requirements that companies consider diverse candidates in their nomination policies.  Two other SEC disclosure rules have similar “disclose or explain” provisions, both of which require disclosures in annual reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 406 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) requires a company to disclose whether it has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. A company that has not adopted such a code must disclose this fact and explain why it has not done so.110 Similarly, Section 407 requires a  wers/062415/private-company-required-disclose-financial-information-public.asp# [https://perma.cc/FCY2-GUKV]. However, none of these documents are generally publicly available. See, e.g., Jennifer S. Fan, Regulating Unicorns: Disclosure and the New Private Economy, 57 B.C. L. Rev. 583, 641 (2016) (discussing the fact that even for large private companies incorporated in the state of Delaware with at least $1 billion in valuation, obtaining a certificate of incorporation from the Secretary of State of Delaware requires a fee). 106 Proxy Disclosure Enhancements, 74 Fed.

COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 2023] Disclosing Corporate Diversity 329 company to disclose whether it has at least one “financial expert” serving on its audit committee, and if so, the name of the expert and whether the expert is independent of management.111 A company that lacks an audit committee financial expert must disclose and explain that fact.112  However, both Sections 406 and 407 are mandatory rules—as opposed to “disclose or explain” rules—because both the NYSE’s and Nasdaq’s rules require a code of ethics and someone with financial knowledge on the audit committee, and, therefore, nullify the “explain” portion of the SEC’s rule. Specifically, Nasdaq’s rule states that each issuer “shall adopt a code of conduct applicable to all directors, officers and employees, which shall be publicly available.”113 The NYSE’s rule similarly requires listed companies to “adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees, and promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers.”114 Correspondingly, Nasdaq requires at least one audit committee member to have “financial sophistication,”115 and the NYSE requires an “accounting or related financial management expertise”116 on the audit committee of listed companies. While neither the NYSE nor Nasdaq require the audit committee to include a person who satisfies the SEC’s definition of a financial expert, both require some financial knowledge. As such, the NYSE and Nasdaq regulations essentially make the SEC’s rule mandatory making them significantly different from diversity disclosure rules in securities laws. 2. Human Capital Disclosures In August 2020, the SEC amended Item 101(c) of Regulation S-K to require companies to make human capital disclosures in the “Business” section of their annual 10-K reports, to the extent the information is material to an understanding of their business.117 It requires companies to  111 Id. § 7265(a). 112 Id. 113 Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, Marketplace Rules 4350(n). 114 N.Y.S.E.

For example, after the amendment became public, then Acting Commissioner Allison Herren Lee released a statement heralding the changes while also expressing regret that the rule is silent on “diversity in the face of profound racial injustice.”124 A June 2021 speech by the SEC Chair Gary  (Jan. 2022), https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/regulation_s-k [https://perma.cc/2CYZ-GZLT].  118 Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105, 85 Fed.

Nasdaq/SEC’s First Standalone Diversity Disclosure Rule On December 1, 2020, Nasdaq filed a proposal with the SEC to enhance the transparency of board diversity statistics through disclosure requirements.127 The SEC published the proposal for comment in the Federal Register on December 11, 2020, and received over 200 comment letters from Nasdaq-listed issuers, institutional investors, state and federal legislators, advocacy organizations, and other parties.128 About 85% of the letters supported the proposal on the basis that it would enhance corporate governance, advance board diversity, facilitate transparency and decision making, reflect the core values of investors and others, enhance corporate performance, and promote investor confidence.129 On February 26, 2021, Nasdaq filed an amendment to the proposed rules and a response letter to the SEC addressing the comments it received.130 In the amendments, Nasdaq responded to concerns raised by  125 Press Release, Gary Gensler, Chair, U.S. Secs. & Exch.

It requires most Nasdaq-listed companies with more than five directors to: (1) annually disclose the statistics of their board directors by gender, race, ethnicity, and LGBTQ+ status; and (2) include at least one woman on their board of directors and one person who is an underrepresented minority—an individual who self-identifies as one or more of the following: Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or two or more races or ethnicities, or who self-identifies as LGBTQ+,136 or publicly disclose why the company’s board does not include two diverse  131 Id. at 2. 132 Id. at 3. 133 Order Approving Changes to Listing Rules Related to Board Diversity, 86 Fed.

Annual Diversity Statistical Disclosure—Rule 5606 Rule 5606 of the Nasdaq/SEC disclosure rule requires Nasdaq-listed companies to annually disclose statistical information of self-identified gender, race, and LGBTQ+ affiliation characteristics of their board of directors. Companies must disclose their board diversity data by the later of August 8, 2022, or the date the company files its proxy or information statement for its annual meeting of shareholders. If the company does not file a proxy or information statement, it must disclose on the date it files its Form 10-K or 20-F during the 2022 calendar year.139 If a company fails to comply with Rule 5606, it will receive a notification from Nasdaq about noncompliance, at which point it will have forty-five calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance.140 Upon receipt and review of the plan to comply with the rule, Nasdaq may provide the company with up to 180 days to regain compliance.141 If the company does not submit a plan or regain compliance within the applicable time periods, it risks being delisted from the exchange.142 b. “Disclose or Explain” Provision—Rule 5605(f) The language of Rule 5605(f) of the Nasdaq/SEC rule departs from other SEC disclosure mandates outside of Item 407(c) of Regulation S-K (also related to diversity), because it simply requires companies to  137 Order Approving Changes to Listing Rules Related to Board Diversity, 86 Fed.

The rule also carries limited financial burden for companies that do not comply with the provision. The SEC calls Rule 5605(f) a “disclosure-based framework for Nasdaq-listed companies that would contribute to investors’ investment and voting decisions.”143 The rule sets out a phased-in compliance based on a company’s listing tier on Nasdaq. All Nasdaq-listed companies must have or explain why they do not have one diverse director by August 7, 2023.144 Companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Nasdaq Global Market must have or explain why they do not have two diverse directors by August 6, 2025. Companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market must have or explain why they do not have two diverse directors by August 6, 2026.  The SEC states that “[w]hile the [rule] may have the effect of encouraging some Nasdaq-listed companies to increase diversity on their boards, [it] do[es] not mandate any particular board composition . . . . Rather, a Nasdaq-listed company that does not meet the board diversity objectives may comply . . . by . . . explaining why it does not meet the objectives.”145 The SEC would not assess the substance or merits of a company’s explanation.146 If a company fails to comply with Rule 5605(f), Nasdaq will notify the company that it has until the later of its next annual shareholders meeting, or 180 days from the event that caused the deficiency to cure it.147 A company that does not regain compliance within the applicable period risks being delisted from the exchange.148  c.

Legislative Responses to Diversity Disclosure On February 18, 2021, the ESG Disclosure Simplification Act was introduced in the House of Representatives.150 In a mostly party-line vote with no Republican support, the Act passed in the House on June 17, 2021.151 The Act is a legislative attempt to establish disclosure mandates for a range of ESG matters, including sustainability, climate risk, political contributions, executive compensation, workforce management, and diversity—race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ status, and gender for all employees.152  As the research in this Article reveals, many companies are already disclosing these data in their ESG reports.153 The ESG Disclosure Act would standardize this voluntary act and make ESG disclosures uniform across the board. In this way, the ESG Disclosure Act is like the European Union’s (“EU”) CSR disclosure rule.154 Recognizing the fact that CSR extends beyond environmental matters, the European Parliament has mandated businesses to discuss information on sustainability, environmental factors, and diversity policies in relation to administrative, management, and supervisory roles regarding age, gender, and educational backgrounds.155  149 Id. at 44425. 150 H.R.

While disclosure is mandatory, there is currently no required disclosure guideline in the EU. There is a guideline furnished by the European Commission in 2017 to help companies disclose ESG matters. However, since the guidelines are not mandatory, companies can choose to use international, European, or national guidelines according to their own characteristics or business environments.

The provision also mirrors Item 407(c) of Regulation S-K by requiring companies to disclose “[w]hether the board of directors . . . has . . . adopted any policy, plan, or strategy to promote racial, ethnic, and gender diversity” among the “board of directors,” the “nominees for the board of directors,” or the “executive officers of the” company.157  Part IV below analyzes why neither the Nasdaq/SEC and the House of Representative’s attempts can improve diversity, and why a new legislation is the right approach if the goal is to improve corporate diversity. C. Private Ordering Outside of regulators and legislatures, the private sector has begun to make changes towards more voluntary disclosures of diversity information and statistics, even beyond ESG reports, by including other forms of disclosure that are considered material to investors. For instance, for the first time in 2021, proxy statements for about 60% of S&P 500 companies included the disclosure of the racial and ethnic makeup of boards.158 Also, in February 2022, Bloomberg Law found that 80%, or four out of every five S&P 500 companies, now disclose some  20Jan2021%2520.pdf [https://perma.cc/T9GY-4AWU]. However, this could change as the EU revisits its regulations on this issue. See Corporate Sustainability Reporting, Eur.

The proposals in Part IV take some of these private ordering strategies into account. However, the proposals go further than what companies are already voluntarily doing for three reasons. First, while most corporations already disclose some amount of diversity information, not all public companies do, and the information disclosed is generally inconsistent across the board. Some companies provide cursory information, while others disclose details. Most companies disclose information about gender, while information about LGBTQ+ diversity is generally more limited.164 Second, while some private companies may also choose to disclose diversity information, most are unlikely to do so. The goal of my proposals is that  159 Andrew Ramonas, S&P 500 Opens Up on Diversity After Floyd as Investors Seek More, Bloomberg L.

My proposals aim to use disclosures instrumentally to increase corporate diversity. III. DIVERSITY DISCLOSURES IN ESG REPORTS In recent years—and particularly since 2020’s racial reckoning—public companies have begun voluntarily disclosing diversity matters in their ESG reports. Scholarship has yet to grapple with this change, and what it might mean for ESG policies. This Section first discusses the scholarship on ESG and corporate diversity. It then empirically shows how public companies have incorporated diversity into their ESG disclosures in the last five years, which has increased exponentially since 2020.  In this Section, I show how companies have been voluntarily disclosing matters related to diversity in their ESG reports in a two-stage process. Diversity disclosures are disclosures about matters related to diversity, including gender, race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ status, and disability. In the first stage of the research, I examined the frequency and percentage of mentions of diversity terms in ESG reports. In the second stage, I examined the frequency and percentage of actual statistics of diversity terms in ESG reports. Table 1 in Appendix A has a list of diversity terms used in the study.  To analyze the extent to which diversity disclosures have been incorporated in ESG reports, I obtained ESG reports from the Corporate Register database, which is the most comprehensive online database of corporate non-financial reporting.165 The data and analysis in this Article are limited to standalone ESG reports and do not include other non-financial data, such as annual reports. Together, there are 1,243 public companies and 3,461 reports across five years from 2017–2021 in the analyses. I chose the last five years to highlight the recent rapid progression in this phenomenon.  Since 2020, there has been an exponential increase in the number of companies disclosing ESG reports in general. As indicated in Figure 1  165 Since the 1990s, Corporate Register has been collecting non-financial reports that companies publicly disclose. Corporate Register harvests the reports from company websites and in many cases, companies send their reports directly to Corporate Register for inclusion in the database.

Given that this Article’s focus is on diversity disclosures in ESG reports, 2020 and 2021 are significant years for analysis.   Figure 1: Overall Number of Companies with ESG Reports Per Year   ESG disclosures are different from financial disclosures in several ways, although it is probable that those differences would gradually become amorphous. First, “financial reporting is mandatory, verifiable, and enforced through methods” like “external audit[s], litigation, and regulatory oversight.”166 ESG reporting, on the other hand, is still largely voluntary,167 besides the SEC’s first approval of Nasdaq’s ESG mandatory disclosure in 2021.168 ESG disclosure is also mostly unregulated and “does not have a widely enforced reporting framework.”169 For example, only about 15% of the ESG reports in this  166 Shuili Du & Kun Yu, Do Corporate Social Responsibility Reports Convey Value Relevant Information?

Second, financial reporting mostly targets the investor community and focuses primarily on financial data. The targeted audiences of ESG disclosures, however, consist of a wider network of stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, business partners, public interest and advocacy groups, governments, nonprofit organizations, the media, and the public at large.170 Third, unlike financial reports, ESG reports “primarily include textual, non-quantifiable information regarding firms’ policies, practices, and performance in social, environmental, and governance domains.”171 Because of this variation, ESG reports differ in content, design, reporting frequency, scope, and quality.172  This variation in form and content creates some challenges for providing uniform analysis of ESG reporting across companies and over time.173 A method for analyzing this varied data is to read the text for  170 Daniel Tschopp & Ronald J. Huefner, Comparing the Evolution of CSR Reporting to that of Financial Reporting, 127 J. Bus. Ethics 568, 570 (2015). 171 Du & Yu, supra note 166, at 253–54. 172 Schreck, supra note 29, at 802. 173 In the absence of mandatory rules, not all companies have ESG reports every year, and report titles can vary from company to company or from year to year. 44.7% (n=1410) of the reports have a variation of the title “Corporate Responsibility Report.” 37.9% (n=1194) of the reports have a variation of the title “Sustainability Report.” 14.5% (n=457) of the reports have a variation of the title “Environmental Social and Governance Report.” The remaining 3% (n=90) of the reports have a variety of titles, including “Environment, Health and Safety Report,” “Community Review,” or “Non-Financial Statement.” The shortest report is 6 pages and the longest is 367 pages. The average report is about 51 pages long.  To illustrate this variation, Best Buy’s 2021 98-page report is divided into Environmental, Social, and Governance sections.

Corporate law scholars have typically relied on hand-coding as a method for analyzing non-financial corporate data that include large amounts of text.174 Hand-coding is mostly reliable but has some major flaws that advances in machine learning, particularly Natural Language Processing (“NLP”), have sought to address. NLP has made the coding process less labor-intensive and more reliable, valid, and reproducible by others.175 NLP was developed by academics in the fields of computer science, linguistics, and mathematics with the primary goal of translating human or natural language into commands that can be executed by computers.176 Research has shown that NLP can be just as accurate as hand-coding text data, making it an increasingly popular method among management scholars, social scientists, and legal scholars.177   sustainability, and diversity and inclusion.

COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 342 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 109:307 Here, I use Python’s NLP tools. The coding process was both inductive and deductive. It was inductive in that I developed categories of words and phrases through my engagement with the data; I read fifty ESG reports manually. It was deductive because part of my analysis came from generally accepted definitions of diversity as representation regarding race and ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ+ status, and disabilities in the literature. Using both methods, I arrived at a carefully constructed list that companies use to describe diversity, such as “racial diversity,” and “gender diversity.” The process of using a carefully constructed list of terms has been found to be as accurate as hand coding.178 I dropped reports that did not have text files, leaving a total of 3,461 reports across all five years in the analysis: 424 in 2017, 483 in 2018, 618 in 2019, 845 in 2020, and 1,091 in 2021. A possible limitation of NLP is that it can omit unsettled or nuanced concepts.179 This concern is minimal here because I have defined diversity to focus on race and ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ+ status, and disabilities. My manual reading of the reports also shows consistent use of the curated diversity terms. Nevertheless, I took an extra step to address this possible concern by extending the list of terms and phrases with noun phrasing, which is an NLP technique used in information retrieval.180 A noun phrase is a word or group of words that functions in a sentence as subject, object, or prepositional object.181 Noun phrasing is used to capture a richer linguistic representation of document content.182 It can improve precision over other document indexing techniques since it allows for multi-word phrases to be matched with words or phrases present in text documents to improve the quality of information retrieval.183 The noun phrase process  178 See Nelson et al., supra note 175, at 220. 179 Id. at 204. 180 I used Universal Sentence Encoder provided through Tensor Flow Hub to convert each noun phrase to a fixed length numeric vector that represents the semantic meaning of the phrase (embedding vector). Universal Sentence Encoder is a publicly available pre-trained model that allows for the representation of words, sentences, and texts as a collection of numbers (numeric vectors) that machines can analyze and mathematical models can use. See, e.g., Daniel Cer et al., Universal Sentence Encoder (2018), https://click.endnote.com/viewer?doi=10.48550%2Farxiv.1803.11175&token=WzM3OTIzNzEsIjEwLjQ4NTUwL2FyeGl2LjE4MDMuMTExNzUiXQ.WKEqcAMopiwZnpi91zriv_9CznA [https://perma.cc/3T9N-CQP3].  181 Kristin M.

COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 2023] Disclosing Corporate Diversity 343 involved capturing sentences and retrieving clusters of words and phrases that are close in meaning to the diversity terms.184 The noun phrasing process generated 217 phrases, most of which were already captured by the well-curated list of diversity terms. From the new retrieved list, I included a few new phrases such as “LGBTQ orientation,” “board gender diversity,” and “directors board diversity” that may not have been originally retrieved. Finally, I categorized the original words and phrases and the new word phrases into groups as indicated in Table 1 in the Appendix.  The carefully constructed list and the noun phrases were then entered into Python to conduct a two-stage analysis. In the first stage, I analyzed ESG reports with mentions of diversity terms. In the second stage, I analyzed ESG reports with actual diversity statistics.  As indicated in Figure 2 below, the first stage of the analysis shows that in 2017, 94.6% of all reports mentioned at least one diversity term, while 97.9% of all reports in 2021 did. In terms of specific terms, as shown in Figure 3 below and further in Table 3 in the Appendix, in 2021, 94.25% of ESG reports mentioned racial diversity,185 95.73% of reports mentioned gender diversity,186 79.96% of reports mentioned diversity and inclusion,187 and 36.90% mentioned board diversity. Notably, board diversity, which is the first ESG disclosure mandate by Nasdaq/SEC, saw a significant increase in mentions between 2017 and 2021. The data also shows an increase in mentions of minority groups and LGBTQ+ employees.            184 I used “spaCy,” the noun phrasing program in Python.

Diversity statistics means that a company uses numerical data to measure the diversity of employee and board members. This differs from mere mentions of terms without numerical data. To conduct this analysis, I conducted a keyword search to find sentences with diversity terms or phrases and the words “percent,” “percentage,” or the “%” symbol. The search generated 11,786 sentences that provide diversity statistics related to any of the diversity words or phrases.188  As indicated in Figure 4 below, the analysis shows that while 71.81% of reports in 2017 included statistics of one of more diversity terms, 90.77% of 2021 reports included statistics with at least one diversity term. In terms of specific terms, as shown in Figure 5 below and further in Table 4 in the Appendix, in 2021, 46.92% (n=473) of companies provided statistics on Asian employees, 53.37% (n=538) disclosed statistics on Black employees, 49.01% (n=494) disclosed statistics on Latinx employees and 16.57% (n=167) disclosed board diversity statistics. Notably, board diversity, which is the first ESG disclosure mandate by Nasdaq/SEC, saw significant growth in statistical disclosures between 2017 and 2021.189   188 The data is both over- and underinclusive. It is overinclusive because there is some possible noise due to the algorithm capturing some sentences that include percentages but not statistics. It is underinclusive because the algorithm is unable to read pictures and many companies place statistics in picture format in their ESG reports. To check for the accuracy of the generated list of statistical information, I randomly selected 16% (n=1,900) of the 11,786 sentences representing 548 companies. A human coder then manually read each sentence to determine any variability in the statistical information as shown in Table 2 in the Appendix. 189 Board diversity is an outlier because of the significant jump between its 2017 starting point and the 2021 disclosures. On the other hand, gender diversity saw only a 31% increase, partly because its starting point was 67.0% in 2017.

The results clearly show an increase in both diversity terms and statistics over time. Finally, I conducted an analysis to determine whether the increase in diversity statistics over time comes mostly from an overall increase in ESG disclosures in general, or a significant increase in diversity disclosures. I focused on 2017 companies since they have been disclosing diversity terms and statistics prior to 2020. Tables 5 and 6 in the Appendix show that the number of ESG reports among the 2017 companies dropped from 376 in 2017 to 283 in 2021.190 Yet, diversity disclosures continued to increase. For example, the mention of “Black” increased from 53.46% in 2017 to 84.81% in 2021 for those companies. The mention of “racial diversity” increased from 82.18% to 95.05%. In terms of statistical disclosures, gender diversity statistics among those companies increased from 67.02% in 2017 to 91.52% in 2021. Racial diversity statistical disclosures increased from 33.24% in 2017 to 74.20% in 2021. Board diversity statistical disclosures increased from 3.72% to 17.67%. In sum, there is overwhelming evidence that diversity disclosures in ESG reports have increased significantly and are on an upward trajectory.191 Mandating these disclosures would likely not be costly to most companies and will have significant advantages, as discussed below.  IV. A BETTER PATH FORWARD This Part analyzes both the Nasdaq/SEC’s mandate of the first diversity disclosure rule and the U.S. House of Representative’s attempt to mandate  190 This reduction is probably because ESG reporting is currently not mandatory so companies can choose not to disclose in any given year.  191 This raises the question of whether the increased disclosure of diversity in ESG reports translates to actual diversity policies in public companies. This question is ultimately an empirical one. However, there are indications that some of the disclosures are about actual policy changes and efforts either in the present or future that companies have put in place or intend to put in place to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. Particularly, companies oftentimes disclose their current board diversity statistics and make projections for how they intend to improve racial or gender diversity in the future based on specific programs and policies they have or intend to initiate. These disclosures therefore seem to be part of a broader set of goals to improve diversity. However, recent industry research suggests that investors may not trust company ESG disclosures. In a survey of 700 chief investment officers, portfolio managers, and buy-side analysts of which 100 are in the United States, 62% reported that they do not trust companies to achieve their stated ESG diversity commitments. Edelman, Edelman Trust Barometer Special Report: Institutional Investors 9 (2021), https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2021-03/2021%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer.pdf [https://perma.cc/6AEU-JFKG]. Ninety-one percent of those surveyed are actively on the lookout for companies that do not deliver on their ESG promises and disclosures. Id. at 11. COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 348 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 109:307 ESG disclosures, which includes diversity disclosures. It explains that because of the limits of securities laws, Congress is better equipped to establish a comprehensive diversity disclosure rule that can improve corporate diversity for all stakeholders—shareholders, employees, customers, governments, and the public. A. Limitations of the Nasdaq/SEC’s Rule Rule 5606, which requires Nasdaq-listed companies to annually disclose statistical information of self-identified gender, race, and LGBTQ+ affiliation characteristics of their board of directors, is a classic disclosure provision. This portion of the rule is mandatory and will provide national data on the board composition of public companies.192 This is a required first step toward increasing diversity. The rule’s language seems to capture what Nasdaq seeks to obtain, which is to provide general statistics for investors. However, beyond that provision, the Nasdaq/SEC disclosure mandate is limited in three important ways. First, it merely requires companies to explain why they lack diversity and would not actually increase board diversity per Rule 5605(f)’s “disclose or explain” provision. Second, it applies only to board diversity and would not require the disclosure of the diversity of employees, executives, or managers, which is equally important. Third, it applies to only public companies listed on Nasdaq’s stock exchange; it does not apply to NYSE companies or private companies with large valuations much like public companies. The “disclose or explain” provision in Rule 5605(f) means that companies need only explain why they do not have diversity on their boards, and there are no other regulatory bodies mandating the rules. The rule also expressly eschews any enforcement by the SEC because the SEC would not assess the substance or merits of a company’s explanation. This means that the rule is unlikely to yield much increase in diverse board members, although it can be a form of shaming. This language sends a powerful signal about the importance (or lack thereof) of board diversity.193 The rule also lacks any forward-looking provision by which to measure change in diversity over time.  192 See supra Subsection II.A.3.a. 193 In fact, there is a strong possibility that the SEC may use a similar “disclose or explain” language for climate risk and other environmental disclosures. See Andrew Ramonas, SEC ‘Mission Creep’ on Climate Ups Republican Lawsuit Threats, Bloomberg L. (June 29, 2021), COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 2023] Disclosing Corporate Diversity 349 The “disclose or explain” rule also shows that disclosure is an end in and of itself rather than a means to a separate social or racial justice end.194 In other words, the goal of the Nasdaq/SEC rule is mainly for companies to disclose some information to investors and not to increase diversity. The goal of disclosures in the securities context is generally for transparency to help investors have all available information to determine investment decisions.195 Indeed, this is reflected in the language of the Nasdaq/SEC rule where the SEC declares that the goal of the diversity disclosure mandate is to improve “the quality of information available to investors who rely on this information to make informed investment and voting decisions” and to allow investors to gain a better understanding of Nasdaq-listed companies’ approach to board diversity.196 The goal of disclosure is about transparency for investors and not to advance social justice. To be sure, Section 77s of the Securities Act gives the SEC authority to make “rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions” of the Securities Act.197 Despite the seeming breadth of this language, the SEC’s role is still largely about ensuring that investors are fully informed to make investment decisions. Expanding the role of disclosures would be beneficial to stakeholders. Second, the Nasdaq/SEC disclosure rule is limited to the disclosure of board diversity. It does not extend to executives, managers, or employees. Indeed, it would be challenging for the SEC to use its powers to require companies to disclose their diversity statistics across the board, particularly extending disclosure to all employees since it would need to justify the materiality of such information to investors. While some companies already include data on employees in their voluntary  https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/sec-mission-creep-on-climate-ups-republican-lawsuit-threats [https://perma.cc/F8TF-4ZXN]. 194 See Adediran, supra note 26, at 885. Disclosures and metrics tracking have extended to other private sector industries where tracking is also becoming synonymous with addressing diversity and inclusion. See, e.g., Molly Huie, Analysis: Yes, Some Firms Are Actually Measuring DEI Well, Bloomberg L. (Oct. 26, 2021), https://www.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberglawnews/ [https://perma.cc/PL58-79LD]. 195 See, e.g., Paul G. Mahoney, Mandatory Disclosure as a Solution to Agency Problems, 62 U. Chi. L.

Third, the rule applies only to Nasdaq-listed companies. Nasdaq and NYSE are the largest exchanges in the United States and there are more companies listed on Nasdaq than on NYSE.198 However, as shown in Figure 6, significantly more NYSE-listed companies disclose their ESG reports in comparison to Nasdaq-listed companies. Overall, 71.7% (n=815) of the companies that disclosed ESG reports are listed on the NYSE, while 28.8% (n=330) are listed on Nasdaq.199 For 2021, 510 NYSE-listed companies disclosed in comparison to 212 Nasdaq-listed companies. This means that a supermajority of the companies that are disclosing diversity statistics in ESG reports are not currently included in the Nasdaq/SEC mandate. While this might seem like a positive—that the mandate would reach companies that are currently choosing not to voluntarily disclose—without a mandate, companies can choose not to disclose at any given time. This is a crucial limitation of the Nasdaq/SEC rule that Congress can address to create a national and uniform rule that would apply to all public and even some private companies whose revenues rival those of public companies.200  198 Jeff Desjardins, Here’s the Difference Between the Nasdaq and NYSE, Insider (July 11, 2017), https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-difference-between-the-nasdaq-and-nyse-2017-7 [https://perma.cc/7YPN-Q44S]. 199 None of the companies in the study are dual listed. 200 There are currently 959 private companies valued at more than $1 billion.

Limitations of Legislative Attempt  The House of Representative’s bill is the first time we see Congress attempt to create a broad ESG disclosure law that includes a range of ESG issues, including diversity, in the 2021 ESG Disclosure Act. However, the Act treats diversity and climate disclosures differently.203 This distinction is not necessary for the goal of addressing both diversity and environmental justice and can easily be cured if Congress adopts the language of the proposed disclosure rule in the next Section. Section 403(2)(A) of the ESG Disclosure Act deals with climate change disclosures. It would require companies to disclose inter alia, “short-, medium-, and long-term financial and economic risks and opportunities relating to climate change, and the national and global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.”204 The provision also has a forward-looking provision that requires companies to “allow for tracking of performance over time with respect to mitigating climate risk exposure.”205 Section 403(3)(B) would require a description of “any established corporate governance processes and structures to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks.”206 Section 403(3)(C) would require “a description of specific actions that [a company] is taking to mitigate identified risks.”207 All three provisions are forward-looking in that they would require companies to show how they are mitigating climate risk over time and track their performance. While the provision does not provide specific timeframes, it nevertheless expects companies to continually show improvement. Contrast these provisions to the diversity disclosure provisions in the ESG Disclosure Act that lack a forward-looking provision and do not require companies to disclose specific actions they have taken to diversify their boards or workforce. Instead, companies need only disclose whether they have adopted any policy, plan, or strategy to promote racial, ethnic, and gender diversity among board members and executive officers. As such, the ESG Disclosure Act is like the Nasdaq/SEC rule that merely  203 Another advantage of consolidation is that it allows for a side-by-side comparison of ESG disclosure mandates. 204 H.R. 1187, 117th Cong. § 403(2)(A) (2021). 205 Id. § 403(2)(B)(v).

Congress can amend the ESG Disclosure Act to include a forward-looking provision and require companies to disclose specific action taken towards improving diversity. While not fully forward-looking, legislatures in California have established board diversity rules with provisions that look into the future for a particular level of diversity. These rules are beginning to have an impact on increasing diversity on corporate boards.208 California requires companies to include women and minorities on their boards of directors. California SB 826, which was enacted in 2018, requires public companies with principal executive offices in the state to have at least one female board member by the end of 2019 and increase that number to a specified number by the end of 2021.209 Section 301.3 (a) and (b) state: (a) No later than the close of the 2019 calendar year, a publicly held domestic or foreign corporation whose principal executive offices, according to the corporation’s SEC 10-K form, are located in California shall have a minimum of one female director on its board. A corporation may increase the number of directors on its board to comply with this section. (b) No later than the close of the 2021 calendar year, a [covered corporation] shall comply with the following: (1) [i]f its number of directors is six or more, the corporation shall have a minimum of three female directors[;] (2) [i]f its number of directors is five, the corporation shall have a minimum of two female directors[;] (3) [i]f its number of directors is four or fewer, the corporation shall have a minimum of one female director.210 The law authorizes the Secretary of State to impose fines for violations of the rule. 211  208 Off. of the Cal.

The law is an exemplar in requiring companies to improve diversity and including a forward-looking approach, albeit in the short term. The rule’s reach is 2021 in the case of gender diversity, and 2022 in the case of racial, ethnic, and LGBTQ+ status diversity. The rule would be even more effective towards long term diversity increases if the forward-looking language goes beyond a set time. However, a California Superior Court judge has struck down the gender, race, and LGBTQ+ status requirements by ruling in favor of Judicial Watch, a conservative foundation claiming that the laws violated equal protection.214 C.

COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 2023] Disclosing Corporate Diversity 355 towards increasing diversity in companies through two mechanisms: shareholder activism through proxy proposals, and employee activism. The proposed legislation takes elements from the Nasdaq/SEC rule, the California Board Diversity Rule, and the ESG Disclosure Act and extends them to include a long-range, forward-looking provision and sanctions for noncompliance. The disclosure mandate would extend to public companies and private companies with valuations of a billion dollars or more.215 These proposals are a thought experiment indicating where legislation might be the best avenue to increase corporate diversity. However, in an increasingly polarized society and Congress, legislation will be challenging. Still, in an ideal world, the following proposals will be helpful towards the goal of increasing racial, gender, LGBTQ+, and disability diversity in companies.  1. Statistical Disclosures The proposed rule will keep Rule 5606 of the Nasdaq/SEC rule intact to require companies to annually disclose statistical information of self-identified gender, race, and LGBTQ+ affiliation characteristics of their board of directors. Unlike the Nasdaq/SEC rule, the provision will include disability status. In addition to board disclosures, the proposed provision goes beyond the Nasdaq/SEC rule to require companies to disclose the gender, racial, ethnic, LGBTQ+, and disability status of the C-suite and other top executives and employees. This is much like Sections 603 and 902 of the ESG Disclosure Act. Companies are already voluntarily disclosing employee data, so this disclosure requirement would establish a rule that would make it consistent across sectors. Companies would be required to disclose their first diversity statistics a year from the passage of the proposed rule. Companies that fail to adhere to this provision will be subject to monetary settlements. Monetary impositions should mirror fines imposed for noncompliance with other SEC rules. Fines as high as $500,000 would be imposed on companies that fail to comply with these disclosures within a calendar year. Fines would double if noncompliance extended beyond a year.  215 Jennifer S. Fan, Regulating Unicorns: Disclosure and the New Private Economy, 57 B.C. L. Rev. 583, 584–85 (2016) (arguing that unicorns should be subject to disclosure mandates like public companies).

COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 356 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 109:307 2. Forward-Looking Provision The forward-looking provision of the proposed legislation takes elements from the California Diversity Rule and the climate provision of the ESG Disclosure Act and extends them. The law would require companies to (1) disclose processes and structures to identify, assess, and manage diversity; (2) provide a description of specific action taken to address employee diversity, equity, and inclusion on an annual basis until reaching a goal set by the company; and (3) disclose steps taken to increase board diversity in an incremental fashion until reaching a goal set by the company.216  The first provision would require companies to disclose activities such as internal diversity assessments, hiring of diversity managers, and specific roles of diversity managers.  The second provision would require companies to disclose programs and policies to increase diversity among their employees, such as recruitment and retention programs, changes in hiring procedures, etc. It would require disclosure of what companies are doing to ensure that diverse employees are included in advancement programs and are rising to the top of employee ranks. Diversity among top executives—CEOs and other C-Suite members—and other employees should gradually increase annually. The provision will encourage but not require companies to increase diversity among their employees until they reach a diversity goal the company has set.  The third provision would require companies to disclose actual steps taken to increase diversity on their boards. Companies would disclose the composition of their nominating committees and the steps the committee is taking to make incremental changes every year until reaching a goal or aspiration set by the company.  Many companies have already begun to set their own diversity goals.217 Many shareholders and stakeholders have become vocal participants of  216 The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights also provides a forward-looking approach to addressing human rights violations in what it calls stages of “due diligence.” U.N.

While the statistical disclosure portion of the rule is unlikely to experience much pushback because it would merely standardize diversity disclosures nationally and many public companies are already disclosing these data, there will likely be significant push back against the forward-looking provision. Similar arguments have been made against the Nasdaq/SEC rule and the California diversity rule.219 However, as Elizabeth Pollman has noted, internal activities in corporations today are much more progressive than the courts.220  Even so, it is important to note that these proposals are politically challenging. Without a major shift in politics, it is unlikely that Congress would mandate diversity disclosures. Still, these proposals provide the ideal solution to increasing corporate diversity. 3. Enforcement Ordinarily, in the context of securities law, Congress would authorize the SEC to implement and enforce the proposed rules. In fact, the ESG Disclosure Act would amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and direct the SEC to engage in rulemaking to set out the requirements for standardized ESG disclosures.221  The rulemaking provision of the ESG Disclosure Act allows the SEC to enforce the Act as it already does for public companies who are required to disclose a range of financial and non-financial information to  sometimes specifying when those thresholds would be met.

COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 358 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 109:307 the SEC regularly.222 However, I argue that the ESG Disclosure Act gives the SEC too much power to set requirements if the goal is to increase diversity for the benefit of all stakeholders. Congress—and not the SEC—should set all standards and authorize the SEC to enforce the rules at the same or similar rate as other securities laws.  Still, since the proposed rules go beyond traditional securities laws, other agencies may be better at enforcing the rules.223 One agency that could potentially implement the rule is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC enforces federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against employees on the basis of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability.224 Employers who have at least 100 employees, and federal contractors who have at least 50 employees that meet certain criteria, are required to complete and submit an annual Employer Information Report EEO-1 to the EEOC and the U.S. Department of Labor.225 The EEO-1 Component 1 report mandates disclosure of information about employees’ job categories, ethnicity, race, and gender.226 The EEOC receives these diversity data from public and private companies. The data is, however, currently kept confidential. With the proposed legislation, the confidentiality requirement of the EEO-1 Report would become moot as companies would be required to disclose statistical and forward-looking internal processes to the EEOC and the public.  There are currently no fines associated with the failure to file an EEO-1 report other than the fact that the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs may terminate or suspend all or a portion of any federal contract held by a noncompliant employer.227 While termination or suspension of a federal contract can be significant, it may not go far enough to incentivize compliance. This is particularly true for large public  222 Id. pmbl. (“To provide for disclosure of additional material information about public companies.”). 223 See Emily N. Strauss, Is Everything Securities Fraud?, 12 U.C. Irvine L. Rev. 1331, 1331, 1335 (2022) (showing that non-SEC investigations brought against companies for harm caused to stakeholders other than shareholders and brought by regulators like the EPA and FDA are more likely to be successful and are more lucrative than traditional securities litigation for harm caused to shareholders). 224 Overview, EEOC, https://www.eeoc.gov/overview [https://perma.cc/YUK8-KASN] (last visited Oct. 16, 2022). 225 EEO-1 Data Collection, EEOC, https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-data-collection [https://perma.cc/8AHH-4CLH] (last visited Oct. 16, 2022).  226 Id. 227 41 C.F.R. § 60-1.7(a)(4) (2020).

Like the SEC, Congress should authorize the EEOC to enforce the proposed rules with actual fines.  To be sure, neither the SEC nor the EEOC are perfect sources of enforcement for the proposed disclosure legislation. Both agencies have limited resources. The SEC is limited by securities laws in its focus on investors,228 and the EEOC’s enforcement power has been weak from the agency’s inception because its role was originally confined to investigation and reconciliation.229 The EEOC has been criticized as “demonstrating limited ambition to change employer practices or remedy past discrimination.”230 Congress can empower whichever agency it chooses—both in terms of allocation of funds and rulemaking—to apply the proposed disclosure rules broadly to public and private companies and include a forward-looking provision. D. Mechanisms for Forward-Looking Provision Scholars have written about the limits of disclosures on corporate behavior in a range of contexts, including in securities laws231 and human rights.232 The overall posture of the literature is that merely disclosing statistical data is unlikely to change corporate behavior.

Rev. 599, 602–03 (2013) (arguing that the impact of disclosures on investment decisions is far more limited than typically assumed); Easterbrook & Fischel, supra note 195, at 680–82 (arguing that mandatory disclosures may not bar securities fraud).  232 See, e.g., Adam S. Chilton & Galit A. Sarfaty, The Limitations of Supply Chain Disclosure Regimes, 53 Stan. J. Int’l L. 1, 23–24 (2017) (showing that supply chain disclosures are less likely than disclosure regimes in other contexts to reduce human rights abuses because they do not provide information on actual products and are weak proxies for human rights outcomes); Marcia Narine, Disclosing Disclosure’s Defects: Addressing Corporate Irresponsibility for Human Rights Impacts, 47 Colum. Hum. Rts. L. Rev. 84, 130 (2015) (arguing that mere disclosures do not change corporate behavior because not enough consumers or investors penalize companies). Despite these seemingly disparate arguments, human rights is likely different from corporate diversity because investors, employees, customers, and corporate executives all want companies to be more diverse.

It further recognizes the need for other mechanisms that can enhance the effectiveness of disclosures and to push companies toward gradual change. While there may be a number of such mechanisms,233 this Section discusses two: shareholder activists and employee activists.   1. Shareholder Activists There are different forms of shareholder activism, including direct communication with management, indirect communication through the press or social media, and writing a letter to the board. This Article focuses on shareholder proposals through proxies, because it involves activist shareholders “put[ting] forth proposals focused on incremental value creation through constructive interaction with company management,” which is the focus of the forward-looking approach.234 Under SEC Rule 14a-8,235 shareholders of public companies are permitted to present proposals on a wide range of social issues to raise awareness and pressure corporate management to act.236 Shareholder proposals are published in proxy statements and typically receive substantial publicity in newspapers. Shareholders then vote on proposals at annual meetings or, more commonly, in proxy statements.  In 2020, shareholders submitted 720 proposals for votes, 37% of which related to social and environmental concerns.237 Shareholder proposals  233 See Anat Alon-Beck, Michal Agmon-Gonnen & Darren Rosenblum, No More Old Boys’ Club: Institutional Investors’ Fiduciary Duty to Advance Board Gender Diversity, 55 U.C.

First, there are large variations on the success of shareholder proposals. The average support on shareholder proposals voted on during the 2020 proxy season was 31.3% of shareholder votes cast.245 The highest support was for governance proposals.246 Proposals for social and environmental matters received support in only 23.5% of cases.247 Specifically, support for environmental proposals increased from 23.9% in 2019 to 30.2% in 2020.248 By contrast, support for social proposals—most of which are related to diversity issues—decreased from 23.6% in 2019 to 21.5% in 2020.249  Second, shareholder proposals are usually not specific enough to require significant corporate action.250 This is because shareholders are limited by the regulatory constraint on “micro-manage[ment],” which prevents them from “probing too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment . . . or seek[] to impose specific time-frames or methods for implementing complex policies.”251 In almost all cases, shareholders present their proposals in the form of recommendations to management rather than binding resolutions.252 Examples of proposals include requests for disclosure of some information, or a report describing  UT] (discussing how Microsoft shareholder proposals forced the company to disclose how it handles sexual harassment claims). 245 Gibson Dunn, supra note 237, at 6. 246 Id.

Despite their limitations, scholars like James Brudney have argued that shareholder proposals can exert some pressure on a board of directors to address shareholder concerns.255 Media coverage of a board’s refusal can also have negative reputational consequences for a business.256 In addition, industry data suggests that investors are engaging in more shareholder activism related to diversity and inclusion.257 In the context of the current SEC “disclose or explain” rule, shareholder proposals may be useful despite some caveats. Specifically, shareholders can use proposals to pressure companies who merely “explain” why they lack diversity to disclose diverse board members. Of course, disclosure alone would not bring about actual change, but a proposal from shareholders asking companies to disclose rather than explain their lack of diversity can exert pressure on companies to meet the SEC’s tokenism rule, which is a good start for companies that completely lack diversity.  However, shareholder proposals will likely be more effective under the forward-looking legislative provisions proposed in this Article, where a company would be expected to increase its employee and board diversity annually. Shareholder proposals can be particularly effective in pressuring companies to describe their plans towards meeting a diversity threshold, and perhaps disclosing year-over-year increases. Specifically, the proposal would require companies to disclose internal diversity assessments, programs and policies put in place to increase diversity  253 Id. 254 Tilley, supra note 244. 255 Brudney, supra note 246, at 597. 256 Id. 257 Seventy-one percent of the 100 U.S. investors surveyed in 2021 said that their shareholders are likely to engage in diversity and inclusion activism.

Among other things, racial equity audits are conducted by third parties to determine whether a company’s policies, practices, and products are equitable and nondiscriminatory for employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate, and whether a company has sufficient mechanisms in place to monitor effectiveness. Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, Facebook, Starbucks, and Citi are some of the companies that now do racial audits. DiNapoli, supra note 163; SOC Inv. Grp., supra note 163.

This level of specificity would allow shareholder activists to pressure companies to do more every year towards meeting their goal. For example, if a company set a 40% diverse employee goal for 2025 and discloses that it changed its hiring process in 2022 to improve employee diversity, shareholder activists can use proxies to ask companies for specific steps taken and whether and how it was yielding results towards its 2025 diversity goal.  Another limitation of shareholder proposals is that they apply only to public companies.258 Since the proposed forward-looking rule would apply to both public and private companies, other mechanisms, such as employee activities, would have an important role to play in implementation.  2.

Just a few years ago, “in 2018, employee activism focused more exclusively on the treatment of women in the workplace”; it now includes social, environmental, and even political issues.261 Climate change has become a particularly salient issue for corporate employees. For example, in 2019, more than 4,000 Amazon employees signed a letter calling on the company to take an aggressive stance to address climate change.262 In 2020, thousands of Minneapolis cleaning workers—who clean corporate buildings like Ecolab, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, and United Health Group—walked off their jobs demanding that their employers act on climate change.263 Employee activists have been successful in mobilizing large numbers of employees, generating significant media attention, and forcing employers to engage in some types of substantive organizational change.264 Indeed, many investors support employee activism as a sign of a healthy workplace culture.265 Despite the rise and seeming success of employee activism, however, diversity—outside of gender—has yet to become a strong catalyst for activism. This is a potential limitation of employee activism, particularly if diversity is separated from other ESG issues. Yet, there is evidence that employee activism may extend more to workplace diversity in the near future. A 2019 survey of 375 corporate executives and board members found that 81% of companies expect an unprecedented rise in workplace  260 David F. Larcker, Brian Tayan & Stephen A.

Edelman, supra note 191, at 19. COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 366 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 109:307 activism over the next three to five years.266 Forty-six percent of companies believe that activism would focus on sustainability and climate change, and 45% believe it would focus on the lack of diversity in the workplace.267 If this survey is prescient, then employee activism may have a role in increasing overall workplace diversity that extends beyond gender.  Even if the proposed disclosure regime is not adopted and we remain in a “disclose or explain” regime, employee activists can pressure companies to disclose rather than explain their lack of diversity. When speaking with a collective voice, workers can have a powerful influence on company executives because activism can impact a company’s reputation.  If Congress adopts the proposed diversity disclosure legislation, companies that do not presently disclose diversity in management and the workplace would be required to do so and show specific year-by-year improvements and changes towards improvement. This would give employees a rare insight into the companies in which they work and allow them to push for incremental change towards their companies’ goals. Without any knowledge of what companies have done each year, it would be challenging for employees to know what to pressure companies to do in subsequent years. The proposed disclosure regime would also provide employees with a clear picture of what other companies are doing to improve diversity annually. Of course, companies who do not want to increase diversity might use data from similar companies to argue that they are perhaps not worse off than their peers who are also lagging in a particular aspect of diversity. While this is a potential risk of comparative information, it can also help employee activists argue that they prefer to work in companies that are leading in diversity rather than lagging.  Beyond shareholder and employee activists, both the “disclose or explain” and the forward-looking provisions can make it easier for other activists, think-tanks, and reformers to use disclosed diversity data to publicly call out companies that are lagging and push them to increase diversity, particularly under the forward-looking provisions.268   266 Herbert Smith Freehills, Future of Work: Adapting to the Democratized Workplace 4 (2019), https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/latest-thinking/the-new-world-of-work-report-warns-of-an-unprecedented-rise-in-workplace-activism-v2 [https://perma.cc/QYL8-3SA9]. 267 Id. 268 See Adediran, supra note 26, at 917–20. COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 2023] Disclosing Corporate Diversity 367 Legislatures and other policy makers can also use the forward-looking provisions to engage in legal reform over time. It is a lot easier to know what other legal changes are needed if policy-makers know what progress has been made in previous years and decades. CONCLUSION Diversity—race and ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ+ status, and disability—has become a central concern in corporations since the 2020 racial reckoning and the COVID-19 pandemic. This Article argues that disclosures can be used instrumentally to increase corporate diversity for the benefit of a range of corporate stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the communities in which companies operate. To achieve this goal, legal reform through Congress is necessary to establish both statistical and forward-looking disclosure requirements that require companies to make improvements towards increasing diversity on an annual basis. With diversity data on not just statistics, but also internal policies and programs, actors such as shareholder activists, employee activists, and policy-makers can use the information to push companies towards increasing diversity. Without a robust set of data, these actors are unlikely to be able to pressure companies to increase diversity at all levels of a company. Scholars and policy-makers have underappreciated this possibility because the disclosures literature in Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) have largely omitted diversity disclosures. Similarly, scholarship on diversity disclosures is still developing and has yet to incorporate the ESG disclosures framework. This Article brings those literatures together for the first time. The marrying of the literatures in these areas is important so that scholars can influence policy changes in ESG. This Article provides original empirical data to show that public companies have been disclosing diversity information as part of their ESG reporting for at least the last five years, which means that companies firmly consider diversity to be part of their ESG disclosures and activities. Scholarship and policy have also been limited by securities laws, which require SEC regulations to rest on the materiality of information to investors. The materiality standard would make it challenging for the SEC to mandate rules to improve diversity for all stakeholders. This Article discusses these challenges in the 2021 Nasdaq diversity disclosure rule approved by the SEC. The rule requires Nasdaq-listed companies to COPYRIGHT © 2023 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ASSOCIATION 368 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 109:307 disclose diverse board members or explain why they lack diverse board members. The rule is unlikely to lead to increased corporate diversity because it merely requires disclosures for investor transparency and decision-making, applies only to Nasdaq-listed companies, and only to board diversity—not executives or other employees. Similarly, the United States House of Representatives recently passed a bill to mandate diversity disclosures as part of a larger ESG disclosures law. However, the bill is flawed because it lacks a forward-looking provision by which improvements can be measured.  This Article argues that unlike the SEC, which is limited by securities laws, Congress can adopt the proposed legislation with statistical and forward-looking provisions that can gradually increase corporate diversity among executives, board members and other employees in both public and private companies.

Policy-makers must go beyond the confines of the securities laws to translate disclosure into societal change.
