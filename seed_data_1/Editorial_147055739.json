    "fullText": "1Editorial As DiGeSt goes to press, the stakes in the debate on gender and diversity are once aagain high. !e beginning of 2017 saw a powerful statement of women across the world with the Women’s March on 21 January, only days after the inauguration of President Trump in the United States. Men and women marched together to ad-vocate women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, workers’ rights, racial equality, and freedom of religion. !at the fight for equal rights continues to be necessary was also demon-strated when a Polish member of the European parliament, Janusz Korwin-Mikke, told his fellow members that he thought women should earn less than men, because they are supposedly “weaker”, “smaller”, and “less intelligent”.1 Korwin-Mikke was called out on his statement by a Spanish member of the European parliament, Iratxe García-Perez, and sanctioned by the European parliament. Protest contin-ued on International Women’s Day when women went on strike to protest against a neoliberal system and to fight for a more inclusive, gender equal world. Within this context of advocacy for women’s rights and human rights, DiGeSt continues its commitment to publishing new work on gender and diversity across the humani-ties, social sciences, and psy-disciplines. It wants to provide a forum for debate on gender and diversity, predominantly in Europe. !is issue opens with a quantitative study by Myrte Dierckx, Petra Meier, and Joz Motmans. In “‘Beyond the Box’: A Comprehensive Study of Sexist, Homophobic, and Transphobic Attitudes Among the Belgian Population”, Dierckx, Meier, and Motmans present and interpret the results of a large-scale survey conducted in Belgium in 2013 on sexist, homophobic, lesbophobic, biphobic, and transphobic attitudes. !eir research splits up attitudes in cognitive beliefs, affect, and behaviour, and looks for correlations between sexist, homophobic, lesbophobic, biphobic, and transphobic attitudes on the one hand and background variables such as sex, age, education, religion, and gender identification on the other hand. According to their study, socially dominant and rigid gender attitudes are the strongest predictors of sexist, homophobic, and transphobic attitudes, and this for men and women, younger and older generations. Despite anti- discrimination laws and equality policies, so Dierckx, Meier, and Motmans assert, “individuals who do not conform to the heteronormative standard . . . often remain the objects of stigmatisation and prejudice”. !e authors argue for a more nuanced un-derstanding of gender as going beyond the metaphorical male/female “box” as crucial for ensuring more positive attitudes towards LGBTQ people. !ey recommend creating more diverse social environments and giving adequate information on sexual identity as beneficial for altering heteronormative and rigid gender beliefs. !e distribution of adequate information regarding sexual identity is precise-ly what is at stake in Justine De Kerf’s contribution “Anti-Gay Propaganda Laws: 1  Rankin, J. (14 March 2017). Polish MEP punished for saying women are less intelligent than men. e Guardian. Retrieved from: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/polish-mep-janusz-korwin-mikke-pun-ished-saying-women-less-intelligent-men DiGeSt. Journal of Diversity and Gender Studies, 4.1 - 2017, 1-3© Birgit Van Puymbroeck and Leuven University Press.https://doi.org/10.11116/DiGeSt.4.1.0DIGEST_VERSIE_1.indb   1 20/11/2017   07:562Time for the European Court of Human Rights to Overcome Her Fear of Commit-ment”. De Kerf elucidates Russia’s prohibition of propaganda of non-traditional (read: LGBTQ) sexual relationships. In Russia, she notes, the law states that “chil-dren should not be misguided into believing that non-traditional relationships are equivalent to traditional (heterosexual) relationships”. De Kerf discusses Russia’s anti-gay propaganda laws in the context of human rights. She examines the role of the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights in enforcing the European Convention of Human Rights, signed by Russia. If the European Court is truly committed to defending the rights of LGBTQ people, she argues, then it should make a clear statement with regard to Russia’s anti-propaganda laws that are found to be at odds with the European Convention. De Kerf, however, also points to the complex political situation, since a strong judgement by the Court condemning these laws could be perceived as a sign of Russophobia, therefore alienating the Russian people from the human rights debate. Nevertheless, she urges the Court to take a strong stance.If the first two contributions are concerned with LGBTQ rights, the next two articles engage with theoretical perspectives and intersectional analysis. Seunghyun Song revisits Frantz Fanon’s seminal Black Skin, White Masks in “Bridging Ep-idermalization of Black Inferiority and the Racial Epidermal Schema: Internaliz-ing Oppression to the Level of Possibilities”. She reads Fanon’s text in relation to phenomenology, elucidating how modes of perception in colonial contexts become ingrained in the body, thus leading to the internalization of racial oppression. Song asserts that Fanon’s insights are still relevant to our understanding of racial oppres-sion today. Phenomenology, she maintains, helps us to attain “deeper and more impactful understandings of oppressive processes and their consequences”, high-lighting “how oppression functions at the level of bodily consciousness”. However, Fanon’s study also needs to be expanded, as he does not take into account an inter-sectional perspective. For Song, the racism and sexism as experienced by women of colour lead to “fundamentally different forms of self-realization and decoloni-zation”: women of colour, she notes, do not don a white mask but a white, male mask. In other words, we need to question how the internalization of oppression works across multiple categories of identity. In “Diasporic Muslims, Mental Health, and Subjectivity: Perspectives and Experiences of Mental Health Care Professionals in Ghent”, Elise Rondelez, Sarah Bracke, Griet Roets, Caroline Vandekinderen, and Piet Bracke rely on Nikolas Rose’s theory of subjectivity and Edward Said’s views of cultural difference to examine how mental health care professionals in Ghent approach and construct diasporic Muslims as subjects and mental health care recipients. !ey focus on diasporic Muslims in Ghent, because this group is “largely underrepresented in or even absent from mental health care institutions in Belgium”. As an ethnic-religious minority in Ghent, diasporic Muslims are often subject to racism and social exclusion, leading to a higher risk of mental health problems. !rough an analysis of twenty-four interviews with mental health care professionals, Rondelez et al. are able to identify Journal of Diversity and Gender StudiesDIGEST_VERSIE_1.indb   2 20/11/2017   07:563a number of assumptions professional health care providers make with regard to diasporic Muslims. !eir research shows that mental health care professionals often adopt a neoliberal logic in which good citizenship equals being a healthy, autonomous individual. Mental health care providers, moreover, are shown to set up a system of “us” versus “them”, by treating diasporic Muslims as different and inferior, for instance, with regard to knowledge about the body and mind. !e authors further warn against the dangers of “hyper-culturalisation”, in which a so-called “culturally sensitive approach” constructs diasporic Muslims as almost entirely determined by their culture. Such a discourse, they argue, ignores personal and contextual differences, reducing diasporic Muslims to one homogeneous group. !e article concludes that further research is necessary to investigate how a more dialogic relation can be constructed between (Western) mental health care professionals and diasporic Muslims. !e “What are you reading?” section presents a number of short notes on recent and canonical critical studies that are of particular significance to a researcher’s on-going project. Sophie Withaeckx discusses Daisy Hernandez and Bushra Rehman’s Colonize this! Young Women of Color on Today’s Feminism; Ntokozo Yingwana ex-amines Chi Mgbako’s To Live Freely in this World: Sex Worker Activism in Africa; Rozemarijn Vervoort explores Sara Ahmed’s Strange Encounters: Embodied Oth-ers in Post-Coloniality; Nira Yuval-Davis’s Gender & Nation is taken up by Laura Andriessen; Emma-Lee Amponsah returns to Frantz Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks; and Sean Bex engages with the discourse of human rights in his discussion of Samuel Moyn’s lecture “How Human Rights Changed Utopianism” and e Last Utopia: Human Rights in History. !ese researchers not only comment on a critical work but also relate it to their own research and gauge its significance for current developments in the field of gender and diversity studies. Finally, we are pleased to announce that DiGeSt has been included in the Flem-ish Academic Bibliography for the Social Sciences and Humanities (VABB-SHW) and that it has found a new home with University Press Leuven. We look forward to the new collaboration and hope that our readers and subscribers will continue to support us. We would also like to acknowledge the assistance of our interns Laura Andriessen and Lisen Maebe with the daily business of the journal and in proof-reading texts. As always, thanks are due to the members of the editorial board and the advisory board, as well as the anonymous peer reviewers for making DiGeSt possible. We hope the journal may continue to flourish and grow. !e next issue will be a special issue on “Unruly Bodies”, guest edited by Sarah Bracke, Anaïs Van Ertvelde, and Lith Lefranc.Birgit Van Puymbroeck, editor-in-chief EditorialDIGEST_VERSIE_1.indb   3 20/11/2017   07:56",
