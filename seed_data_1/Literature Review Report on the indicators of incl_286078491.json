These networks take on a variety of configurations and also include community spaces. The unie-LGBtQ research partnership project - survey component will make it possible to document the experiences of inclusion and exclusion of LGBTQ+ people living in Quebec. This objective will be achieved through a vast bilingual survey conducted online with respondants from all regions of Quebec. We will document the experiences of inclusion and exclusion or non-recognition faced by LGBTQ+ people in the principle spheres of their lives important to their ability to thrive, that is, the family, work and their main social networks. In addition to this survey, we are providing a synthesis of relevant academic data published between 2007 and 2017 on the experiences of inclusion and exclusion, including prejudices, discrimination and victimization which LGBTQ+ people may experience in different areas of their lives.the report5UNIE-LGBTQ Research Partnership - April 2018the reportThis report presents the results of a literature review of available data on experiences of inclusion and exclusion, including prejudices, discrimination and victimization that may be experienced by LGBtQ+ adults. This data describes the experiences in the important areas of their lives, that is, their family of origin, housing, health and social services, work, neighbourhood, sports, education and public services, as well as community and spiritual life.The data has been extracted from research conducted primarily in North America (United States and Canada) and Europe (Germany, Sweden, Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium, and France), but also Oceania (Australia and New Zealand). These countries vary in terms of the legal protections they offer to LGBTQ+ people. These variations in the legal context play a significant role in the forms of inclusion and exclusion experienced by LGBTQ+ people and their scope. Because of this, it is not possible to claim that the data presented here is representative of the situation in Quebec or Canada.Only the UNIE-LGBTQ survey of LGBTQ+ people in Quebec can enable us to understand the scope and particular forms of inclusion and exclusion that they experience on a daily basis in the areas of their life important to their fulfilment. The survey, while inspired by the indicators presented in this study, is not limited to them. The next steps in planning the survey will in fact make it possible to enrich these indicators and ensure they are relevant to Quebec’s context.6Literature review reportData sourcesThe data included in this report comes from a review of academic articles published between 2007 and 2017, and reviewed by peers to guarantee their credibility. The bibliographic search permitted us to identify close to 13 000 articles based on relevent keywords and inclusion criteria. Articles deemed irrelevant have been eliminated, whether after a close reading of the article’s title, abstract or full text.with this process, we were able  to identify a total of 211 articles,  76 of which provided data for  the meta-analytic synthesis.examples of keywords  used to search for relevant articles  (all of the keywords were used in English and French)inclusion criteria• Presenting data collected among LGBTQ+ people over 15 years old • Presenting the indicators of inclusion and exclusion and their prevalence • Published in an academic journal (with a peer review committee) • Published between 2007 and 2017Non-binaryGenderqueerGeNder; traNs aNd NoN-biNary  life experieNcestransexual; transgendertransidentityNeighbourhoodresidential instabilityHealth servicesareas of lifeschool; sports; recreationHealth servicesresidencesocial exclusionstigmaexclusioNbullyingVictimizationdiscriminationsexual diversitysame-sex couplessexual orieNtatioNsexual minority(ies)Homosexualitylesbian womanGay manbisexuality; lGbsocial participationpositive climateiNclusioNinclusive policiesprotection of rightsfeeling safe7UNIE-LGBTQ Research Partnership - April 2018Data extraction anD synthesisareas number of stu-dies synthesizedsample size  (including heterosexual and cisgender participants  for comparative purposes, depending on the case)Family of Origin 13 min = 37, max = 3 458, total = 7 422Housing 13 min = 66, max = 6 456, total = 26 245Health and Social Services20 min = 64, max = 6 456, total = 24 206Work 22 min = 119, max = 7 884, total = 30 402Neighbourhood 5 min = 51, max = 730, total = 1 901Sports 2 min = 76, max = 1 209, total = 1 285Education 15 min = 7, max = 7 040, total = 21 543Notes. Min: size of the smallest included sample; Max. : size of the biggest included sample; Total: sum of participants in all included samplesFor each of the areas of interest, we have carried out a meta-analytic synthesis of the available studies. We have also sometimes reported portions pulled directly from the studies wtihout any other transformation, such as in the case of community and spiritual life, an area that did not include enough relevant studies to integrate into a meta-analysis. When a number of studies reported data on the same phenomenon, they were aggregated in order to reduce all of the available information to a single number (an aggregated proportion) which enabled us to simplify the presentation. Depending on the area, between 2 and 22 studies have been synthesized, which has made it possible for us to collect responses from 1 285 to 30 402 people. The number of LGBTQ+ participants in the sample of the studies varies from 670 to 22 768.The majority of the data presented here are averages of the data reported in all of the relevant studies. These averages are considered to be more reliable than studies taken individually. There is a limit, however, to this reliability as different factors limit the comparability of studies used for the same average, such as margins of error, variations in the composition of samples (the characteristics of respondents) or even variations in the means of collecting data (for example, methods of recruiting participants or questionnaires used). Finally, we would like to emphasize that the aggregated averages summary of the studies included in the meta-analytic synthesis8Literature review reportdo not take into account the fact that the data came from different countries, where forms of inclusion and exclusion vary given the laws and norms that can influence how LGBTQ+ people are treated by institutions and the public.It’s possible to have an idea of the precision of these averages by calculating confidence intervals. Confidence intervals show two values and the true value probably (19 times out of 20) lies between these two values. The smaller the confidence interval’s range, the more the average can be considered precise and reliable. On the other hand, the larger the confidence interval’s range, the less the average can be considered precise and reliable.Take the following data, taken from the health and social services synthesis, as an example.The number 26.1% means that on average, in all of the studies reviewed on unmet health needs, 26.1% (that is, a bit more than a quarter) of LGBTQ+ respondents reported having needs left unmet.The values between square brackets indicate the range of the confidence interval. In this example, without the information enabling us to be more precise, we can assert that it is very probable that the true average lies between 21.5% and 30.8%.report having unmet health needs26.1%[21.5-30.8%]areas of Life revieweD9UNIE-LGBTQ Research Partnership -
