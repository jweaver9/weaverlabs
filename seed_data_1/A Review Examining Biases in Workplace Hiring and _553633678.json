First, the review studied how these biases affect the hiring process and foundthat even though there have been marginal improvements for some minority groups, racial biasesstill exist in the workplace. Certain minorities, such as African Americans, experienced the sameamount of hiring discrimination since the 1990s. Second, the review looked at how these biasesinfluence the promotion process and inhibit marginalized groups from reaching higher payingjobs. Despite Asian Americans experiencing fewer struggles with the hiring process, they are theleast likely race to be promoted in the workplace. Finally, the review suggested a combination ofawareness training and unconscious bias training to make concrete change within anorganization’s hiring and promoting process. This methodology should help companies prioritizediversity and inclusion through creating a transparent and fair environment.Keywords: racial bias, gender bias, unconscious bias, hiring, promotion3A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESIntroduction    This review aims to explore the different types of biases that can influence workplacehiring and promotion processes. Corporate recruiters often select people who they believe willsucceed; however, the choices could be influenced by different and unrelated factors tocompetence or potential.The purpose of this paper also focuses on the current impact of racial bias, gender bias,and unconscious bias in the workplace. In present times, these different factors affectunderrepresented peoples, both in terms of ethnicity and gender, abilities to succeed and progressin the workplace. This issue leads to an over-representation of White men in higher positions anddoes not provide minority people the opportunity to improve their life situation. Therefore, thispaper will begin by defining and reviewing the different biases and then it will describe theoverall effects of these biases in the workplace.Racial BiasRacial biases lead to minority races having fewer opportunities to be hired and promoted.Despite the illegality of discriminating against someone on the basis of their race, this form ofbias still happens frequently (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 1964). Thisdiscrimination can manifest in employers treating employees differently because of personalcharacteristics associated with their race and applies to any aspect of their employment,including hiring, promotion, compensation, hourly wages, job assignments, training, benefits, orfiring. For instance, African Americans are twice as likely to be unemployed as whites (Pager &Shepard, 2008). In a study by Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), researchers tested whetherWhite racially identifiable names received more callbacks for a job; indeed, White names4A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESreceived a 50 percent higher callback rate than equally qualified Black applicants. Furthermore,underrepresented minorities also experience occupational segregation, with many minorities inlower levels of job stability and fewer opportunities for promotions in their jobs (Parcel &Mueller, 1983; Smith, 2002). The lack of opportunities leads to an overall lower satisfaction inlife and prevents minorities from reaching higher brackets of wealth and success in an unjustmanner.Gender BiasGender bias remains a controversial topic in the workplace, specifically within humanresources practices, such as hiring, training, pay, and promotion, because some people do notbelieve that it exists (Stamarski & Son Hing, 2015). This type of bias is defined as when a jobapplicant is discriminated against or treated differently because of their sex, gender identity, orsexual orientation (Equal Rights Advocates, 2022). Some employers hold biases against womenwhen they hire for male dominated roles. Female applicants receive fewer call backs and aregiven fewer interviews in comparison to male applicants, due to employers viewing them as lesscapable (McIntyre et al., 1980; Firth, 1982).In a study that evaluated professors’ preferences in choosing a laboratory manager, themale applicant was rated as more competent and hirable and was offered a higher starting salarythan the female applicant (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012). These examples illustrate the gender biasamong employers and the unfairness that minorities experience when attempting to find a job ora promotion. Additionally, women are often discriminated against because employers assumethey will start families at some point in their careers (Lee, 2021). Even though this form ofdiscrimination is illegal according to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, employers5A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESrefuse to promote women or provide them with lower-level tasks because of the motherhoodassumption. Women also face disadvantages when they ask for more flexible schedules and feelinclined to deny motherhood or their families to receive a better chance of employment orpromotion (Lee, 2021).Unconscious BiasEmployers’ unconscious biases can lead to decisions that benefit the stereotypicalemployee, White and male, and harm employees who do not fit that majority-based stereotype.The human brain tends to categorize things together in order to grasp and understand occurrencesin the world (McCormick, 2016). These categories can be as simple as “good” versus “bad”,which could lead to potential issues when choosing employees to hire. One bad experience witha minority individual, and one’s brain could generalize that experience on how they view otherpeople from that same minority group. This generalization detrimentally affects minorityindividuals’ abilities to acquire a high-paying job, if the hiring part of the organization has theseunconscious biases. Furthermore, one specific aspect of unconscious bias is the similar-to-mebias. This type of bias is defined as a tendency to prefer people who look and think like us (TheDecision Lab, 2022). Similar-to-me bias occurs due to a form of trust-building when onebelieves that they share similar characteristics with a stranger. It can cause people to favor othersin regards to gender, race, and age (Greenberg, 2010). In the workplace, this bias can causeemployers to hire people who look like them and who have similar thought processes, which canlead to a very homogenous group (Psych 424, 2015).In-group bias is also related to the similar-to-me bias. This type of bias is defined asfavoritism or prioritization toward groups where an individual shares one or more identities6A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASES(Baumeister & Vohs, 2007). People tend to identify with certain social groups, whether they arebased on race, gender, religion, personality characteristics, physical looks, occupation or evencommon interests (Grant, 2018). People who are not viewed as a part of the group are in theout-group and can fall victim to in-group bias. If an employer believes they share a group withthe candidate they are interviewing, then they will be more likely to give that candidate a job. Ifan employer believes the candidate to be a part of the out-group, then the candidate is less likelyto be given a job offer unless they show they are highly skilled and can contribute to thecompany (Grant, 2018).A subsection of similar-to-me bias is the halo effect. This effect changes employers’perception when evaluating potential employees or people to promote. The definition of the haloeffect is a tendency to give a high rating based on a general impression from a previous positiveinteraction (Thorndike, 1920). The positive impression creates a “halo” that biases ratings ofspecific attributes, characteristics, or dimensions of job performance. As shown by a study byYustina and Gudono (2017), the halo effect has a high correlation with performancemeasurement. People who are viewed in a positive light due to the halo effect may be given anadvantage over their peers, even if they only completed one good thing; if their work thereafterworsened, their employers may give them the benefit of the doubt. This belief coulddetrimentally affect minority candidates if they feel less comfortable in a predominantly Whiteenvironment and provide a mediocre first impression. In one interaction, some people of equalability could ruin their chances of achieving the job, and their White peers could receive thebenefit of the doubt from feeling safe within the interview space and giving a good firstimpression.7A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESOverall EffectsAll of these factors must be explored further in order to grasp a better understanding ofthe dynamics in the workplace. As minority individuals tend to be discriminated against andprevented from pursuing higher level opportunities more frequently than non-minorityindividuals, it is crucial to learn why employers make certain hiring decisions and whether theseinnate biases change an employers’ promotion choice. To increase equality in the workplace,organizations must prioritize a variety of candidates through training their employees to be awareof their biases and to choose candidates based on merit and diversity.Different types of decision-making biases infiltrate the corporate workforce and affect itshiring and promotion processes. The most prominent forms of bias observed during theseprocesses are racial bias, gender bias, and unconscious bias. Racial bias includes an unreasonedjudgment based purely on an individual’s race (Williams, 2011). Quillian and Midtbøen (2021)examined racial bias to better understand hiring discrimination and reasoning behind employerdecision-making. They found that the current standards regarding race influence thediscrimination in hiring employees in the workplace. Gender bias is defined as prioritizing onegender over another (Rothchild, 2014). In the workplace, it is commonly used as men are chosenover women for the sole reason of their different gender. Unconscious bias stems from theattitudes and stereotypes that can affect our perception of others (Staats, 2016). Specifically,when making hiring decisions, employers can have unconscious bias when they assesscandidates (Dalton & Villagran, 2018). The similar-to-me bias influences employers to choosecandidates who share similar characteristics and interests (Baumeister & Vohs, 2007). Employerswill choose applicants who think like them, which creates a homogeneous organization. The haloeffect describes a scenario in which a person projects one single positive quality of another8A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESperson onto the individual’s other qualities (Mondy & Martocchio, 2016). When hiringemployees, an interviewer may see one positive quality in an interviewee and blanket thatpositivity onto the rest of the traits of the interviewee even though the person may not pass otherqualifications (Thomas & Reimann, 2022). These biases create unjust practices within thecorporate ladder whether it be through hiring decisions or promoting decisions. Some factorsalso prevent minority groups from climbing the corporate ladder. These factors include: a lack ofaccountability in affirmative action programs, outreach and recruitment barriers, and a lack ofmentoring for minority individuals (Johns, 2013). In order to eliminate these factors,organizations must participate in bias awareness training, unconscious bias training, andincorporate accountability to hire and promote diverse candidates. This paper will further addressbiases within the workforce and how they detrimentally affect underrepresented minorities andexplore  the promotion process to suggest ways in which an organization can eliminate biases tocreate a more open minded and safe workplace.In order to analyze this question, this paper will review what is currently understoodabout racial bias, gender bias, and unconscious bias and how these biases influence employers.The paper will then examine the research gap of how the leadership promotion process isaffected by these biases. Finally, this paper will suggest solutions to educate organizations aboutpotential biases and how to avoid them when considering new employees or people to promoteto leadership positions.9A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESMethodsArticlesI identified and reviewed 67 articles related to the core topic of this thesis. Articles werelocated in several databases including: Google Scholar, PsycInfo, PubMed, and the AnnualReview of Psychology. First, I read through other reviews of workplace biases to gain a betterunderstanding of which types of bias generate more influence. Then, I selected racial, gender,and unconscious biases. These biases seemed to have the most tangible effect on employers’hiring and promotion decisions. To ensure the credibility of the articles, I chose sources that werecited by many other researchers and examined sources within the papers themselves.The results section will first outline the effects of race, gender, and unconscious bias onthe hiring process. Then, it will discuss the effects of race, gender, and unconscious bias on thepromotion process. Afterwards, the results will speak toward mitigating the effects of thesedifferent types of biases. Finally, the section will consider a version of awareness training incombination with unconscious bias training to make a difference in the workplace.10A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESResultsHiring ProcessDifferent minority groups experience different levels of discrimination within the hiringprocess. Noted differences in the unemployment rates by ethnicities (see Figure 1) could reflecthigher levels of discrimination faced by certain groups, as well as other factors.Figure 1: Unemployment rate by ethnicity in the U.S. in 2020. Adapted from the U.S. Bureau of LaborStatistics (Report 1095, 2021).Although every minority ethnic group has higher unemployment rates than the Whitegroup, some groups experience this discrimination more than others. Women also experiencehigher levels of discrimination in the workplace relative to men. As the minority group incomparison to men, women often find challenges in being hired over their male counterparts.11A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESUnconscious biases against minority groups lead employers to hire the same types of people (i.e.,White men). Specifically, similar-to-me bias and ingroup bias create a tendency in whichemployers choose people who think like them, look like them, and share similar interests.Finally, the halo effect creates disadvantages for minority groups, as their White counterpartscould be making a positive first impression. Cultural differences, such as different greetingmethods or societal norms, may cause minority groups' first impressions to be less positive, andthe halo effect causes employers to give the positive first impressions the benefit of the doubt.Even though Asian American candidates experience less discrimination in the workplacecompared to other ethnicity groups, they are still undervalued when compared to Whitecandidates (Lai & Babcock, 2012). Their purported deficits in social skills leads employers tohold their stereotype against them. Despite Asian Americans performing as, if not more,competently than their White competition, they tend to be ranked worse in interviews due tosocial interactions and differences. Whitening an Asian American person’s name has also beenshown to increase their hiring odds (Kang et al., 2016). As displayed by Figure 2, the callbackrate increased when the Asian American participants changed their name from being ethnicallydistinct to a White name.12A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESFigure 2: Callback rates of Asian and African American job applicants with their original resumes versuswhen they whiten their resumes (Kang et al., 2016).The discrimination Asian Americans face is a combination of racial and unconsciousbiases. Before Asian American candidates step into an interview, their interviewers already havea predisposition to believe that they are socially incompetent due to existing stereotypes. Onemistake in the interview, and the Asian American candidate is already at a large disadvantage. Ajob interview is similar to a friend-screening process; most times an employer wants to enjoyworking with their employees. Choosing a friend is similar to hiring an employee because one islikely to spend a decent amount of time with the individual. Thus, one will want to appreciate theindividual’s company. If an employer believes a potential candidate will be not enjoyable towork with, then they are less likely to hire them.13A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESHiring discrimination against Latinos has seemingly decreased over time (Quillian et al.,2017). In 1990, researchers found that Whites received 30 percent more callbacks than Latinos,but in 2010, whites received only 15 percent more callbacks than Latino individuals. It isimportant to note that these observations do not take into account that Latinos can beWhite-passing in terms of color-wise (i.e., skin tone) and name. These differences would bemore difficult to measure but would provide clarify if the racial discrimination against Latinoshas actually decreased. In a 2021 study, 59 percent of Latinos believed that lighter skin enabledthem to get ahead in the workplace (Noe-Bustamante et al., 2021). Furthermore, 62 percent ofLatino adults believe that darker skin inhibits their ability to move forward in the job world.These statistics convey a scenario where White-passing Latinos may face less discrimination inhiring situations, but Latinos in general do not receive this fortune (Noe-Bustamante et al.,2021).African Americans experience systematic forms of racism and discrimination in theworkplace hiring process. For example, in the hiring process, candidates are often evaluated ontheir professionalism. African American candidates are at a disadvantage when it comes to theevaluation of professionalism based solely on appearance. Companies typically ban certainhairstyles for workers, including braids or dreadlocks, which negatively targets Black individuals(Wingfield and Chavez, 2020). If African American individuals are not permitted to express theirindividuality and culture within a corporate workplace, they will likely not feel as comfortable incorporate jobs compared to White employees. A combination of a psychologically unsafeenvironment where there is low trust to take an interpersonal risk (Wingfield and Chavez, 2020)and workplace discrimination discourages diverse groups from applying to certain jobs.Additionally, overall hiring rates for African Americans still illustrates similar levels of14A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESdiscrimination over the last 25 years (Quillian et al., 2017). Compensatory policies thatcompanies instill to mitigate racial bias have little effect on hiring discrimination (Quillian et al.,2018). Even though this discrimination is not uniform across organizations, some companiesshow measurable bias, which highlights the problem with corporate America (Porter, 2021).Women also face prejudice in workplace hiring processes, as they are oftenunderestimated by male employers. Male hirers are typically influenced by similar-to-me bias, asthey believe that other men will do a better job than their female counterparts (Grant, 2018). Thisbias leads them to undervalue the skills of women because they overlook their potential. A studyfound some companies believe that a sexist work environment does not detrimentally affect itsfemale employees (Faniko, Ellemers, & Derks, 2022). Even though participants admitted theatmosphere was sexist, they did not understand that a hostile environment would adverselyimpact women’s careers. Additionally, companies try to be future-oriented by assuming that thewoman interviewee has or will have children at a later time and be unable to work. Figure 3shows this bias, because women’s callback rate is more than two percent lower than men’s whenboth parties have children.15A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESFigure 3: Probability of getting a job callback by gender and parent status (Caccavale, 2021).This assumption is an illegal decision because employers cannot use the factor of gender to makehiring decisions; however, this rule does not prevent organizations from subconsciously usingthis criteria to make specific choices (U.S. Department of Labor, 2022) as it is difficult to provethat being rejected for a job was directly due to issues of pregnancy or motherhood. Finally,some people believe a false myth that women are less academically-oriented or want to achievelower jobs than men. Researchers found no merit for this stereotype, and both women and menreported similar motivations for achieving academic jobs (Faniko et al., 2022).Not only do women face discrimination from their male peers, but they also tend to actprejudicially against themselves. In a United Nations report of 75 countries, researchers found16A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESthat 90 percent of both men and women hold biases against women (Eaton, 2022). Thesenumbers are somewhat surprising given that discrimination on the basis of gender was outlawedby Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Women are 25 to 46 percent more likely to be hiredin applications and interviews where personal information is kept anonymous, which illustratesthat women are not hired because of their gender as opposed to their merit. Nowadays,companies often use artificial intelligence to sort through resumes. This newer technology is alsohindering women’s careers (Huet, 2022). If a user was female, the algorithm would show theuser fewer ads of high-paying jobs. Even though the user could have a better skill set andresume, the algorithm could still provide her with lower-level jobs.Similar-to-me bias also occurs in the hiring process. A study on the similar-to-me bias inemployer interviews found that employer-applicant similarity significantly influenced jobsuitability evaluations (Sears & Rowe, 2003). Employers tend to choose job candidates who aresimilar to them, whether it is in terms of looks or personality traits. Similarities among peoplefoster trust and relationships, so people are inclined to choose others who are like them (Grant,2018). In another study of simulated employee interviews, researchers presented several Blackand White candidates with biographical information that was either similar or dissimilar to theinterviewers (Rand & Wexley, 1975). They found that the applicants with similar biographies tothe interviewers were given more positive reviews and higher ratings for the job. This discoveryemphasizes that similar-to-me bias does influence employers and their hiring decisions. Ifemployers can find any interest or characteristic that they relate to, then they will be more likelyto hire the candidate. Similarities among personality characteristics also make a difference inemployers’ hiring choices. In a study that evaluated the personality characteristics ofextraversion and conscientiousness, researchers found that people tended to choose applicants17A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESwhose perceived personalities were similar (Türetgen et al., 2009). If the employer believed thatthey had a similar level of extraversion and conscientiousness to the interviewee, then theinterviewee tended to receive a higher rating and the job.Overall, race, gender, and various unconscious biases can occur throughout the hiringprocess. Different minority ethnic groups experience different levels of discrimination. WhereasAsian American candidates experience less discrimination than Latinos and African Americans,they are still undervalued in comparison to White applicants. Even if Asian American applicantshave more skills and experience on their resumes, they could be looked over for a White personbecause employers believe they have less social competence. Latinos seem to face lessdiscrimination than decades ago, but this difference could be due to some Latino individualspassing as White, whether it is due to their skin tone or their name. African American applicantsstill receive a lot of discrimination, whether it is explicit or through implicit biases against theirphysical characteristics. Critiques in regards to the concept of professionalism tend todisproportionately affect African American candidates. Women are typically overlooked in favorof their male counterparts because of bias related to pregnancy or motherhood, which someemployers believe would prevent them from being as available as a man to devote time to theirwork. Additionally, women tend to discriminate against themselves when they have the power tohire people, and even artificial intelligence algorithms display less high-paying jobs to women,which decreases their opportunities. Finally, similar-to-me bias influences employers to choosepeople who resonate with them. If the candidate shows more similarities with the interviewer,then the employer will be more likely to hire them.18A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESPromotion ProcessMinority ethnicity groups tend to have bigger challenges in attaining higher levelpositions. As White men tend to dominate the current leadership positions, it makes it moredifficult for minority groups to reach such similar levels in organizations, creating an unjustsystem. Racial biases, gender bias, and unconscious biases all influence the current leadership inways that undercut any attempts to build greater diversity in their other leadership positions. Asdepicted by Figure 4, White people dominate managerial positions, which shows the inequity ofleadership positions among minority groups.Figure 4: Breakdown of race in managerial positions in the U.S. Adapted from Zippia:https://www.zippia.com/manager-jobs/demographics/.19A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESFurthermore, as seen in Figure 5, as positions within a company increase in leadership, theproportion of women decrease. Women start in almost half of support staff positions and end infive percent of the top one percent earners. This disparity illustrates the lack of women inleadership positions and high paying positions.Figure 5: Proportion of women in types of workplace positions globally (Ariella, 2022). Adapted fromZippia:https://www.zippia.com/advice/women-in-leadership-statistics/#:~:text=What%20percentage%20of%20executives%20are,positions%20are%20held%20by%20women.20A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESEven though Asian Americans are considered the model minority, they still struggle toreach leadership positions within companies. Asian American individuals tend to have higherlevels of education compared to other ethnicity groups, but despite this advantage, there isunderrepresentation of Asian Americans in leadership positions within companies (Lai &Babcock, 2012). Part of this reason comes from a collective culture style, where many Asians aretaught to stay within the group majority and to not stand out (Chen, 2015). However, a biggerreason perhaps stems from subjectivity of evaluation systems, racial biases, and unfair treatmentof Asian Americans (Lai & Babcock, 2012). Oftentimes, employers have evaluated AsianAmericans lower on social skills, perceiving them as awkward and lacking mainstreamsociability. This perception leads to a more negative impression of Asians, even if they arecompetent in non-behavioral skills.More specifically, in a study conducted in the Silicon Valley, Asian Americans were themost likely to be hired into technology-related jobs, but the least likely to be promoted intohigher management positions (Gee & Peck, 2017). Qualified Asian candidates are half as likelyto be promoted as their White counterparts. Many leaders may assume that Asian Americans arenot underrepresented minorities, as they make up 12 percent of the professional workforcedespite making up only 5.6 percent of the US population (Gee & Peck, 2018). Thus, whencompanies hold diversity programs to hire or promote diverse candidates, Asians do not benefit.Whereas other diversity programs tend to focus on both inclusion and diversifying thecompany’s management, the diversity programs for Asian Americans only focus on culturalinclusion.As Hispanic individuals already make up a small proportion of the workforce, theirparticipation in the leadership of organizations is even smaller. A report on Hispanic employment21A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESfound that Latinos were 7.79 percent of the permanent federal workforce but only 4.5 percent ofthose individuals reached senior level positions (Federal Hispanic Work Group, 2008). Thissmall proportion could be due to a combination of a lack of proper training and discrimination inthe promotion process. As the company's leadership team usually is dominated by White people,they may be less inclined to branch out and select people from minority groups such as Latinopopulations. Furthermore, in STEM-related jobs (jobs that appear to be more difficult and requirelevels of higher education), 42 percent of surveyed Latino individuals believe that theyexperience discrimination due to their race as illustrated in Figure 6 (Funk & Parker, 2018).Figure 6: Proportion of employed adults who have experienced racial workplace discrimination brokendown by race. Adapted from Funk and Parker (2018). Note: there were insufficient numbers of Asianrespondents in the study who work in non-STEM jobs to accurately display on the figure.22A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESThis statistic illustrates the difficulty that Hispanic people face when trying to achieve higherlevel and higher paying jobs. They are not given the same opportunities to be promoted and toreach a leadership position. Another study stated that 33 percent of Latinos living in Americabelieve that they’ve been discriminated against throughout the promotion process (Neel, 2017).Latino people believe that they do not receive equal opportunity to be paid or promoted equal totheir White peers. If the workplace system harbors such prejudice, Latino individuals will beinhibited from reaching higher levels in their organizations. The lack of promotions preventspeople from getting ahead in organizations and in improving their quality of life.Black employees often find it difficult to reach higher-level positions. African Americanindividuals find themselves pushed into lower-level racialized jobs (e.g., minimum wage jobs,entry-level jobs, etc, janitorial staff), instead of jobs that allow them the trajectory (Collins,2016). Furthermore, due to the halo effect and unconscious biases, White employers tend topromote and advocate for White employees instead of equally qualified African Americanemployees (Wingfield & Chavez, 2020). White employers may have predispositions againstAfrican American employees, whether these biases stem from past experiences or assumptions.If African American employees are not being chosen for reasons they cannot control, such astheir race, they are at a serious disadvantage. The majority of employers in higher positions areWhite, and if they continue to choose employees who appear similar to them either by race,gender, or culture, then the workplace will continue its homogeneity and discrimination againstmarginalized groups.Women also face challenges while trying to attain higher positions in the workplace. AUN report found that almost 50 percent of the respondents believe that men make better businessexecutives and political leaders (Eaton, 2022). Not only do women find it more difficult to move23A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESup in their careers, but they are also paid less for the same job as a man. 25 percent of womensay they have earned less than a man for the same job (Eaton, 2022), despite this being illegalbased on the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (Equal Pay Act of 1963, 1963). The 2020 Global GenderGap Report emphasizes this study because it found that a 31.4 percent gender gap continues toremain (Global Development Commons, 2020). Furthermore, women’s skills are often evaluatedas soft skills, which are valued less than hard skills (Huet, 2022). This social bias continues toemphasize the gender pay gap and puts women at a big disadvantage.Mitigation of these EffectsIn order to make the workplace a fairer environment, these biases must be mitigatedthrough thinking more creatively and in an open-minded fashion. Research suggests thatemployers often create shortlists when evaluating candidates for positions (Lucas et al., 2021).One study found that when participants were asked to create longer shortlists (six names insteadof three names), they selected 33 percent more women than the original lists (Lucas et al., 2021).The longer list seems to promote more diversity, because when people spend more timepondering about a problem, they tend to generate more creative solutions. Companies can alsomake their applications anonymous (no names, school names, or other personal information) toeliminate potential unconscious biases that may relate to race and gender (Hirsch, 2018). Byremoving any identifiers that determine people’s race and gender, employers can make fairer,less biased decisions. Organizations should prioritize educating their employees throughawareness training that teaches people about the different types of biases, how to acknowledgesuch biases, and how to consciously combat them (Ruiz, 2021). Furthermore, transparencywithin the hiring and promotion process is key to unbiased practices. If people must think about24A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESand be honest about their choices, then they will likely be more open to making fairer, less biaseddecisions. Finally, asking for feedback and actually implementing constructive criticismdemonstrates to employees that the companies care (Ruiz, 2021). Through compassion,companies can show their minority group individuals that they are willing to make changes intheir hiring and promoting process.Awareness TrainingLearning about biases is the first step in awareness training. Implicit biases can berecognized once they are consciously recognized by the individuals (Hui, et al., 2020). Onceemployees and employers are educated on implicit biases, they can recognize negative influencein the workplace and attempt to mitigate it. Awareness of innate biases also encourages people tochange their behavior (Sabin, et al., 2022). Researchers found that regardless of the strength ofpeople’s biases, awareness training still enabled them to reduce the effects of these beliefs.Companies should also contribute through policy changes and leadership support throughtransparent evaluations and providing support if individuals feel discriminated against (Hui et al.,2020).Unconscious bias training must be modified in order to be effective. This training mustteach both awareness and strategies to mitigate biases, change individuals’ behavior, and trackeach attendee’s progress (Gino & Coffman, 2021). To educate its participants on awareness, thetraining defines different types of biases and the emotional detriment biases have onmarginalized groups of people. It includes structural changes to the hiring and promotionprocesses and long-term commitment to diversity training that continues over time. In order to beeffective, this form of training focuses on potential for growth and concrete ways to positively25A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESchange one’s behavior (Forscher et al., 2017). As people change more easily with smaller,tangible actions (Devine et al., 2012), these concrete examples help people move away fromdiscrimination and stereotypes. This style of unconscious bias training displayed success in astudy, whose participants stated that they had a heightened awareness of their biases, and theyshowed less bias and discrimination weeks after the training (Gino & Coffman, 2021).Marginalized groups of people, such as women and minorities, also reported that they felt saferin the environment and a greater sense of belonging post training. The training also focuses onfostering empathy and friendships between employees. Positive interactions between differentgroups of people leads to decreased anxiety when working together which in turn reducesprejudice (Devine et al., 2012).26A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESDiscussion and ConclusionsAfter reading numerous articles on different types of biases, this review found severalmain findings. Within the hiring process, there are race, gender, and unconscious biases in theform of similar-to-me bias. Minority groups experience different levels of discrimination but allseem to be valued less than White candidates. Women face bias from hiring algorithms and forhaving the potential chance of being a mother. The similar-to-me bias detrimentally affectsminority groups, as employers tend to choose people with similar characteristics and interests.This means that if the interviewers are White, then they will be more likely to choose a Whitecandidate as they will find more things in common. Furthermore, the promotion process is alsoinfluenced by race, gender, and unconscious biases. These biases can be overcome, but thereneeds to be conscious attention paid to doing so. Even if some minority groups face fewer hiringproblems, they can still face promotion issues. As women are a minority group in promotionpositions, they face issues because men believe they are more oriented toward leadership.Women also experience difficulties with higher pay, as they tend to be paid less than men for thesame jobs.These biases create a more negative and non-inclusive work environment. In order tomitigate these issues, employers must do a better job of creating awareness and making aconscious effort to fight these biases. Companies should also invest in awareness andunconscious bias training to educate their employees and help them make a concrete action planto change their biases. When making a hiring or promotion decision, employers need to questiontheir rationale for choosing a candidate and make sure it is skill-based and merit-based. Theyalso need to consciously choose candidates with different backgrounds, ethnicities,27A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASEScharacteristics, and ways of thinking. Diverse perspectives lead to more successful teams, soorganizations should make this effort.This review had several limitations and strengths. Even though many sources were usedto write this review, there is still the need for more research on the promotion processes ofcompanies. Organizations tend to not disclose details regarding their promotions, which makes itdifficult for researchers to analyze their decision making. Hiring and promotions processes arenot transparent to outsiders. Different types of studies about promoting marginalized groups alsoseem scarce. The halo effect and unconscious bias have received less research attention, whichmade this review unevenly distributed between types of biases. Despite these challenges, thisreview addressed racial and gender biases adequately and combined literature about hiring andpromoting processes. In order to grasp a better understanding of the inequities within theworkplace, several graphs were imputed to highlight the disparities. These statistics emphasizedthe lack of equality and reaffirmed the problems with the current hiring and promoting practices.The section on awareness training provides examples of how companies can properlyeducate their employees to mitigate their innate biases. A combination of these strategies cancreate an effective methodology to increase teamwork and compassion and decrease prejudice.Awareness training is the first step to conscious behavioral change to make concrete progress.Organizations, who prioritize diversity and inclusion, can create step-by-step small action plansto help their employees mitigate biases against one another. By continuing to emphasize diversityand bias training, instead of simply checking off a box, companies can foster real change to makemarginalized employees feel safe.In the future, researchers should study the efficacy of this combination of awarenesstraining and unconscious bias training within other companies. The study should include28A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESdifferent types of corporations, such as technology-related companies, law firms, medical-relatedfields, education workplace, and the entrepreneurial start-up world. People can learn whethercertain fields suffer more from different implicit biases and how to use these trainings to preventfurther biases. Researchers should also study multiple firms within each field to see if corporateleadership makes a difference and which individual companies prioritize a diverse leadershipboard. They should see whether a diverse board of leadership affects the amount the companyemphasizes a safe and fair space for minority groups.In conclusion, this review contributes to the research gap of different types of biases(racial, gender, and unconscious) in both the hiring and promotion processes. It also adds to theliterature about unconscious bias training, specifically the modification of such training toinclude structural changes to the hiring and promotion processes and long-term commitment todiversity and inclusion training. If employers learn to control their biases, then the workplacemay become a more diverse and safe space for every minority group. Research shows thatdiverse groups outperform homogeneous groups by creating an inclusive space, which leads to a76 percent increase in employee engagement and a 20 percent increase in team innovation(Alexander, 2021). Companies and organizations will focus more on equality whilesimultaneously performing better.29A REVIEW EXAMINING BIASESReferencesAlexander, M.

    "abstract": "This review examined three different types of workplace biases: racial, gender, and unconscious biases. First, the review studied how these biases affect the hiring process and found that even though there have been marginal improvements for some minority groups, racial biases still exist in the workplace. Certain minorities, such as African Americans, experienced the same amount of hiring discrimination since the 1990s. Second, the review looked at how these biases influence the promotion process and inhibit marginalized groups from reaching higher paying jobs. Despite Asian Americans experiencing fewer struggles with the hiring process, they are the least likely race to be promoted in the workplace. Finally, the review suggested a combination of awareness training and unconscious bias training to make concrete change within an organization’s hiring and promoting process. This methodology should help companies prioritize diversity and inclusion through creating a transparent and fair environment",
