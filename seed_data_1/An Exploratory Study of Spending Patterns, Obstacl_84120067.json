The results of this study would assist both the wedding and hospitality industry by providing much needed financial and planning information.  A descriptive, four-section survey was distributed online via Qualtrics utilizing snowball sampling. A total of 152 respondents participated in the study; 84 heterosexual and 68 LGBTQ. The respondents completed the questionnaire that measured wedding traditions, wedding spending, obstacles and challenges faced during their wedding and wedding planning, and demographic information.  The results of this study indicated that same-sex couples getting married did not spend as much as heterosexuals. There were certain aspects of spending and traditions that were closely related including the areas of: purchasing food and beverage, purchasing a wedding ring, having a proposal and having a reception. Results also showed that neither group faced obstacles or had any challenges during the course of wedding planning. Lastly, the results revealed potential for increased wedding spending of same-sex couples as they can begin to plan their weddings now that 37 states have legalized same-sex marriage.  It is hoped the results from this study will lead to further research resulting in greater awareness of the same-sex wedding market and provide more information about this demographic to the hospitality and tourism industry due to the fact that LGBTQ weddings will provide an additional $33 billion to $46 billion in profit to the industry if all states become legal.   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Words cannot describe how thankful I am for my mentor and advisor, Dr. Kelly A. Way, whose laughter and push got me through this thesis. I would not have gotten to where I am without her guidance and dedication to my time here at the U of A, not to mention all the long hours she spent with me working on my thesis. It’s been fun getting to perform groundbreaking research with her on the LGBTQ community! I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Jacquelyn Wiersma-Mosley and Dr. Robert Harrington, who dedicated their valuable time and support for the completion of this study.   Other acknowledgements should be given to the Faculty and Staff in the Hospitality Department in the School of Human Environmental Sciences for giving me so much encouragement: Dr. Godwin-Charles Ogbeide, Dr. Rhonda Hammond and Mr. Allen Powell.  Finally, a huge thank you to Ms. Leann Potts. This would not have been completed without her and her magical way with words.          DEDICATION  My thesis An Exploratory Study of Spending Patterns, Obstacles and Traditions Among Same-Sex Marriage vs Heterosexual Marriage: Who’s the Bigger Spender? is dedicated to my mom, Kelly Perritt. Without her support of my return to graduate school, encouraging words to keep me going, and daily YouTube videos, I would not have survived!     TABLE OF CONTENTS  I.

As acceptance of LGBTQ rights increased, the LGBTQ tourists started feeling more comfortable with being “open” or “out” when traveling. This new show of acknowledgment among the LGBTQ community enticed destinations to start tapping into the “pink” market and increase their marketing budgets’ to focus on the LGBTQ traveler. The U.S. trend was to specialize in niche products for this particular market and was therefore one of the more popular destinations allowing gay marriage (Holcomb & Luongo, 1996).  Early reports had stated that the LGBTQ community was a small segment; estimated at 3 to 5% of the U.S. population. However, in a 2013 analysis by Witeck Communications, it was found that approximately 6 to 7% of the adult U.S. population was willing to self-identify as LGBTQ, totaling between 15 to 16 million adults age 18 years’ and older. As states legalized same-sex marriage, those who had not been able to marry would be able to do so; thus, contributing to a potentially massive boost in sales and revenue to the hospitality and tourism industry. According to research by the Williams Institute (2014), same-sex weddings would create an additional $16.8 billion in revenue for the wedding industry if legalized in all states. The 2012 census reported there were 639,440 same-sex unmarried partner households in the U.S.   2 (Census.gov, 2014). Since 2004, 37 states and Washington, D.C. have legalized same-sex marriage, 20 since 2014. For the first time, a majority of Americans are living in a state that allows same-sex marriage.  Figures show, the states that legalized same-sex marriage saw an increase in travel, sight-seeing, dining and lodging revenue from same-sex couples, in addition to their wedding guests (Williams Institute, 2014).    The wedding business was a $51 billion industry that employed close to 800,000 people and was thriving in the U.S. (Grose, 2013). The average total cost of an American wedding was approximately $30,000 (i.e., rings/bands, attire, venue, catering, entertainment, flowers, décor) excluding the honeymoon (XO Group Inc., 2013). The wedding industry, as a whole, was viewed as incredibly old-fashioned and heterocentric. It was becoming understood in the industry that same-sex marriage equaled “pink” dollars and had become an important addition to the travel and tourism market as well as the wedding market. Just as there was an existence of Jewish and Southern culture, LGBTQ culture existed; and, with that culture came unique trends, traditions and experiences. Some business embraced same-sex weddings; but still some had not. Most wedding websites, cards and invitations were designed for a man and woman; business contracts and marketing materials were tailored to heterosexual couples; and most photographers didn’t have experience taking pictures of same-sex weddings and were using traditional heterosexual wedding portrait poses.  According to the U.S. Legal definition of same-sex marriage, this was a ceremonial union of two people of the same-sex; a marriage or marriage-like relationship between two women or two men (U.S. Legal Definitions, 2014). The debate regarding same-sex marriages in the U.S. had been on-going for decades despite the fact that same-sex marriage had existed throughout history. As the legislation regarding same-sex marriage laws in order to meet the constitutional   3 demands of equality established by this country’s ‘fathers’ (The History of Same-Sex Marriage, 2014).   Within the hospitality and tourism industry, “pink” money was a well sought after entity as cities continued to compete with gay-friendly locations and activities for LGBTQ tourists, even within states which had banned same-sex marriages (Boyd, 2008). Other states, which had legalized same-sex marriage, saw same-sex marriage as a tourist attraction that greatly impacted both the economy and business within the industry. While tourism bureaus have long sought out LGBTQ visitors who tend to be affluent and well-traveled, the legalization of weddings will give them new avenues. Purpose of Study The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a significant difference in the amount of money spent on same-sex weddings versus heterosexual weddings. In addition, this study explored spending patterns, obstacles, and traditions associated with weddings of heterosexual and same-sex marriages. The same-sex marriage movement for legally recognized unions in the U.S. could provide a huge economic boom in the hospitality and tourism industry via promoting, planning and hosting same-sex weddings.   Problem Statement As a lucrative business strategy, the wedding industry should consider pursuing same-sex couples as clients due to the amount of money same-sex couples spend on their wedding as opposed to heterosexual couples. There has not been lucrative research published regarding same-sex marriage cost and the impact on the wedding and hospitality industry.     4 Objectives The following objectives were developed in order to achieve the purpose of this study as previously mentioned: 1. To describe the economic impacts on the wedding industry by legalizing same-sex marriage. 2. To compare spending of same-sex weddings to that of heterosexual weddings. 3. To determine if it is financially beneficial for the wedding / hospitality industry to market directly to same-sex couples who are planning a wedding.  Such data will lead to further studies and result in greater awareness and a more informed hospitality and tourism industry. Research Questions 1. How does same-sex wedding spending compare to heterosexual wedding spending? 2. Where is the majority of money spent in heterosexual and same-sex weddings? 3. What are the obstacles heterosexual and same-sex individuals face when planning a wedding? 4. Do heterosexual couples and same-sex couples follow the same wedding tradition? Assumptions and Limitations  It is assumed that participants in this’ study will answer the questionnaire honestly and accurately and they will have an understanding of weddings and wedding purchases.  In addition, it is assumed that the participants will also have some sort of wedding experience on which to base their answers to questions regarding personal wedding preferences.  It is also assumed the participants either will be a member of the LGBT community or heterosexual.  The scale of research will be limited for the following reasons:   5  The participants of the study will be limited to the LGBT community and heterosexual adults from each population; therefore, the results cannot be generalized outside of this target population.  There is no way to determine whether all of the answers given by the respondents represent a true experience. Definition of Terms Buying Power: The amount of money that households or persons have available to spend and save after paying taxes and pension contributions to the government: also referred to as disposable personal income. Civil Union: The State of Vermont began this formal recognition of lesbian and gay relationships in July 2000.  A civil union provides same-sex couples some of the rights available to married couples in areas such as state taxes, medical decisions and estate planning. Domestic Partner: Unmarried partners who live together. Domestic partners may be opposite sexes or the same sex.  They may register in some counties, municipalities and states and receive some of the same benefits accorded married couples.  Economic Impact: Incremental spending created by individuals and activities that are “imported” to the city’s economy, spending that would not normally have occurred in the local economy. Foundation Covenant: This document was inspired by the Ketubah, Quaker wedding certificate and other sacred documents and is an art piece that the couple, and later the guests sign as witnesses. Heterocentric: Having a heterosexual bias or basis. Heteronormative: Heterosexual is the normal.   6 Heteronormativity: The institutionalized expectation that bodies are constructed into oppositional situated (sexual and social) categories (Ingraham, 2005). LGBT: Acronym for “lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.” *LGBTQ: Acronym for “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning.” Pink money: All money spent by the LGBT community for travel. Same-sex couple: A relationship between two people of the same sex; mainly associated with homosexuals: also known as same-sex partners. Same-sex marriage: Institutionalized recognition of same sex couples. A legally or socially recognizable union between two consenting adults of the same biological sex or social gender.  *For the purposes of this study, LGBTQ will be used.               7 CHAPTER 2:  LITERATURE REVIEW  Economic Impacts of same-sex marriage U.S. impacts on legalizing same-sex marriage  First legalized in the Netherlands in 2001, same-sex marriages legally spread to 18 countries and 36 states plus Washington, D.C. in the U.S. (Schwarz, 2014). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were an estimated 252,000 same-sex married couples in the U.S. (Schwarz, 2014). The economic impact of same-sex marriage is widespread and has created new economic opportunities for the hospitality and tourism business across the U.S. Same-sex marriage’s transformation from ‘the impossible’ to ‘all but inevitable’ has been, by most accounts unprecedented.   Studies performed by the Williams Institute (2014) predict huge boosts to states’ economies as well as the potential creation of $2.6 billion in three years in revenue for the wedding industry, if same-sex marriage were legalized in all states. In addition, a great boost in employment opportunities would be seen.  The Congressional Budget Office found legalization in all states along with governmental recognition would have a positive impact on the budget in the amount of an extra one billion dollars each year for the next ten years (Covert, 2013).   According to the U.S. Census (2014), there were approximately 640,000 same-sex unmarried partner households in the U.S. If all these couples were to individually plan a wedding, they could potentially generate $1.5 billion in orders for rings, flowers, cakes, attire, caterers, photographers, planners, receptions, music and hotels as well as tourism in general. This would not even include the revenue generated per each out-of-town guest (Badgett, 2013). For   8 example, Seattle’s economy saw an $88 million increase within the first year of legalizing same-sex marriage; Massachusetts saw a $110 million increase; and, New York City alone saw a $259 million increase in revenue (Beckham, 2014). Other states financially impacted included: Connecticut ($16 million in 2008) and Vermont ($5 million in 2009) followed by Iowa ($8 million in 2009) and New Hampshire ($5 million in 2010) (Wicker, 2012). Even the surrounding states saw boosts in travel, sight-seeing, dining and lodging from same-sex couples and their wedding guests (Beckham, 2014).  The Williams Institute has predicted economic impacts same-sex marriage would have on each state which had recently become legal and those that have yet to become legal. Potential revenue for the first year alone include: Wyoming at $1.6 million; Alaska at $5.1 million; Arkansas at $8.7 million; South Carolina at $16 million; Louisiana at $18.1 million and North Carolina at $41.2 million. Further, a political advocacy group Equality Florida, estimated $117 million could be spent statewide in the first year by LGBTQ residents alone nevermind those coming from out-of-state to either attend or get married themselves (Daly, 2015). The same study estimated 2,626 jobs could potentially be created just to keep up with the demand.  Same-Sex Wedding Spending  Though literature was scarce on same-sex wedding costs and the impacts, several websites and blogs attempted to determine wedding spending of same-sex couples. Bernadette Coveney Smith, initially a same-sex wedding expert, founder and owner of a top gay wedding planning company as well as founder of the Gay Wedding Institute, had researched and published books about same-sex weddings and had made a significant contribution to the literature pertaining to same-sex wedding ceremonies. Community Marketing and Insights (CMI), an LGBT consumer research company, paired with the Gay Wedding Institute to produce   9 a 2013 survey titled, “Same-Sex Couples: Weddings and Engagements”. The survey received over 900 responses from same-sex couples throughout the U.S.; of these, 57% were already married and 19% were in domestic partnership. The survey results also documented trends and insights in same-sex marriages (Community Marketing, Inc., 2013b).  In states offering civil unions or domestic partnerships, the economic impact was somewhat less than those states that had legalized same-sex marriage. This was attributed to 76% of these couples not having a traditional wedding that included a ceremony and reception (Community Marketing, Inc., 2013a). However, research provided by CMI and Gay Wedding Instituted concluded that same-sex couples who were legally married and had a more traditional wedding spend three times the amount compared to a couple who received a civil union or domestic partnership. This difference was due to same-sex couples who were legally married were more likely to have a ceremony along with a reception with large number of guests (Community Marketing, Inc., 2013a).  Several studies on same-sex marriages have shown that the majority of the LGBT community paid for their own weddings with no outside financial support. These finding included 84% of gay men and 73% of lesbians (Community Marketing, Inc., 2013b; Gay Wedding Institute, 2014). Complementing the previous research, XO Group, Inc. (2014a) found 13% of heterosexual couples paid for their own wedding. These findings, along with data collected by the U.S. Census (2014), stated that unmarried same-sex couples in the U.S. had an average income of $103,980 compared to the average unmarried heterosexual income of $62,857. These finding reinforced the potential economic impact of the same-sex demographic. Past research declared that the female same-sex married couples spent 15% more on weddings than did their male counterparts (Gay Wedding Institute, 2014). This was surprising because   10 male couples had a greater household income, but spent less on their weddings (Prudential, 2013).  Generally, same-sex wedding celebrations were small with an average number of guests at around 80; only 28% of the weddings surveyed had more than 100 guests (Gay Wedding Institute, 2014), as opposed to heterosexual weddings with an average of 138 guests (Parade, 2014). The wedding industry also reaps the benefits of out-of-town guests in the form of dollars; depending on the state/economy, per diem per guest could be anywhere from $100 to $300 (XO Group Inc, 2014a).  Same-sex weddings had been traditionally more intimate than heterosexual weddings, spending less on the ceremony and festivities ($15,849) as compared to heterosexual weddings with an average cost of $29,858 (XO Group, Inc., 2014a). However, both heterosexual and same-sex couples spent approximately the same per guest: heterosexual ($220 per guest) and same-sex ($205 per guest) (XO Group, Inc., 2014a). LGBTQ couples were not tighter with money, they typically invited fewer guests (NYC & Company, 2012).            11 Figure 1.1: States that have legalized same-sex marriage as of March 2015 (Freedom to Marry, 2015)         12  “Pink” money: Same-sex marriage tourism The hospitality and tourism industry should hear wedding bells and see dollar signs with same-sex marriage being legal in 36 states and counting.  The spending power that existed in the LGBTQ community is very powerful: they like to travel and they like unique experiences. As we have seen in states that already extend marriage to same-sex couples, this spending boost can lead to an influx of tourism dollars that benefit local businesses and an increase in state and local tax revenue. According to the Out Now Business Class, research shows the annual money spent on tourism by the LGBTQ community will exceed $200 billion for the first time in 2014 world-wide, and that the LGBTQ community is the largest spending market is the U.S. contributing $56.5 billion to the economy on an annual basis (Hospitality Net, 2013).  Figure 1.2: Timeline of the History of Same-Sex Marriage in the U.S. (The History of Same-Sex Marriage, 2014)   Breakdown of same-sex marriages Past literature has focused on potential impacts of same-sex marriage; however, none have examined legal same-sex weddings (Kimport, 2012). Lewin (1998) found some same-sex couples attempted to resist heteronormativity in ceremonies in an “unconscious resistance”, some sought to establish traditions whereas others blended the two, creating their own unique 1969: New York, Gay rights movement at Stonewall Inn1970: Minnesota same-sex couple challenged the denial of same-sex marriage1973: Maryland became the first state to ban same-sex marriage1984: Berkley, CA enacted the first domestic partnership ordinance1987: Washington, D.C., 'The Wedding', 2000 same-sex couples made commitments1992: Same-sex employees started receiving domestic partnership benefits1997: Hawaii became the first state to offer domestic partnership benefits1999: California created the first domestic partnership statute2004: Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage2014: 25 states plus Washington D.C. have legalized same-sex marriage  13 experience (Hull, 2006; Kimport, 2012). Hull (2006) found same-sex commitment ceremonies to be more of a legal and political statement than heterosexual ceremonies (Kimport, 2012). Both same-sex and heterosexual groups had similar views about the most important reasons to get married: ‘love’ being the top ranked reason followed by ‘companionship’ and a ‘lifelong commitment’ (Pew Research Center, 2013c). Interestingly, LGBTQ individuals ranked ‘legal rights and benefits’ and ‘financial stability’ as being the most important reasons to get married while heterosexuals stated ‘having children’ and a ‘relationship recognized in a religious ceremony’ as important (Pew Research Center, 2013c). As support and acceptance from family and friends further develop, the size and scale of same-sex weddings will grow and likely patterns and traditions will reoccur (Grinberg, 2012). Ceremony Marriage had been redefined as society's attitudes evolved, and some Americans began to openly support same-sex marriage. “Commitment ceremony” and “civil union” had become non-existent terms with the rise of marriage equality in the U.S. The type of same-sex ceremonies chosen were dependent on the state in which the couples were planning to wed; full marriage, civil union, domestic partnership, or commitment ceremony, in addition to religious or non-religious approaches, had been choices that were previously dictated to same-sex couples. Past literature stated that planning a wedding generally took 10 to 12 months, which was comparable to heterosexual wedding ceremonies; however, for LGBTQ couples, the most important characteristic for consideration and planning was choosing the ceremony type (Johnson, 2014). LGBTQ couples tended to opt for a more relaxed atmosphere than heterosexual couples, with 40% of same-sex couples using the term \"casual\" to describe their wedding (Brydum, 2013).    14 Same-sex weddings had been divided into four prime classifications of styles stated by Carol Smart (2008). “Regular weddings” or “secular ceremony” were the most common style selected by same-sex couples. A “regular” or “secular ceremony” was characterized by the officiate (non-religious) leading the couple to exchange vows and rings in front of a congregation of friends and family followed by a reception (Clarke et al., 2013; Smart, 2008). “Minimalist” weddings were chosen by couples who had been together for many years and just wanted legal protection (Clarke et al., 2013; Smart, 2008). “Religious” or “spiritual” weddings were typically performed by a religious or ordained officiate and chosen when couples wanted the union to be blessed and recognized by a church or religion (Clarke et al., 2013; Smart, 2008). These weddings were considered similar to conventional heterosexual weddings. According to the Gay Wedding Institute (2014), 88% of same-sex couples did not have their wedding ceremony in a place of worship. “Demonstrative” weddings or “full-on” public ceremonies traditionally required time to plan and were considered for political purposes for couples who wanted to make a statement (Clarke et al., 2013; Smart, 2008).  The most challenging task for a same-sex wedding was an officiate. This was attributed to the states’ laws where the wedding was held as well as the couples’ religious views (Kidder, 2014). Ordained officiates who were allowed to bless same-sex weddings (whether or not the state approved) included: Unitarian, Quaker, Reformed Catholic Church, Metropolitan Community Church and Ethical Culture faiths, as well as three branches of Judaism (Kidder, 2014). Since the majority of same sex couples were not wed in a place of worship, secular venues (i.e., city halls, banquet halls) were common, normally followed by a party at a friend’s or relative’s home (Kidder, 2014).   15 Bernadette Coveney Smith founder and owner of “14 Stories” gay wedding planning described the same-sex weddings she planned as being either small weddings for up to 50 people or big weddings for higher budgets, bigger numbers and more details (Morpeth, 2014). Most of her weddings started out with a ‘gay wedding tradition’ of guests being greeted with champagne and sparkling water before the wedding ceremony began. This set the tone for the event. Traditionally, the couple walked together down a central aisle or down two separate aisles, occasionally accompanied by a friend or family member. The guests remained standing holding a glass of champagne for a blessing/toast called “Validation & Affirmation”. Traditions  Same-sex couples routinely looked to their religion and culture to make traditional wedding rituals unique during wedding planning (Kidder, 2014). Same-sex couples have had traditions of their own, just not so ‘traditional’ as a heterosexual wedding. Bernadette Coveney Smith has planned hundreds of weddings for same-sex couples since 2004 (Community Marketing, Inc., 2013b). According to Smith’s survey, in combination with CMI, less than 15 % of same-sex couples incorporated traditional wedding features such as wedding showers, ring bearers, flower girls and a garter/bouquet toss; and, only 20 % danced with a parent. Female couples were more likely to embrace normal wedding traditions such as engagement ring purchases, rehearsal dinners and first dances than the male couples (Community Marketing, Inc., 2013b).  According to a survey from The Knot (2013) and The Advocate (2013), LGBTQ couples honored traditions and had begun to create new ones as well. The survey, which polled LGBTQ and heterosexual Americans, found same-sex couples were less likely at 58% to have a formal proposal and were much less likely at 19% to ask family permission before proposing. Regarding   16 wedding planning, same-sex couples were more likely at 55% to equally share the responsibilities of planning. On the other hand, the survey found same-sex couples were less likely to walk down the aisle escorted by a family member or to incorporate religious vows into the ceremony. However, they were much more likely to write their own vows at 49%. Same-sex couples opted for the justice of the peace to officiate their ceremony (Brydum, 2013). Destination Weddings  According to a 2012 survey by GayWeddings.com, same-sex couples chose out-of-state destinations with 64% traveling to the nearest marriage-equality state to wed (Ely, 2014). Same-sex destination weddings or ‘legal elopements’ were an expanding market for wedding professionals who resided in legal same-sex marriage states making a great opportunity to add additional income for hotels, restaurants, caterers, photographers, planners and florists (Ely, 2014). Research found that same-sex couples chose destinations wedding spots similar to heterosexual couples, but the difference between the two was the amount of knowledge and form of execution that wedding professionals had regarding same-sex ceremonies (Ely, 2014). The states which legalized same-sex marriage saw a very impactful boost to the wedding and hospitality industry within the first year, with money coming in from out-of-state couples and their guests.  Challenges  Even though same-sex marriage became legal in some states, some businesses in the hospitality and wedding industries were stuck on ‘old’ traditions, which made the wedding planning experience stressful and unpleasant (Somerville, 2013). Some businesses would not let go of heterocentric traditions and rituals which excluded same-sex couples (i.e., white dress and tux, lawfully wedded man and wife) (Somerville, 2013). Most wedding websites, cards and   17 invitations were designed for a man and a woman, not to mention that forms, business contracts and marketing materials were tailored to heterosexual couples stating ‘bride and groom’ (Somerville, 2013). Other ways in which businesses made were venues that had only one bridal dressing room, bakers not selling cake toppers representing same-sex couples, and wedding registries requiring only the husband’s last name (Somerville, 2013). A huge challenge regarding same-sex wedding professionals had been the photographers who did not have experience taking pictures of same-sex couples. Instead they would use the traditional heterosexual couple poses they were used to taking, which led to photos of awkward poses for same-sex couples (Somerville, 2013).   One in four same-sex couples experienced some form of discrimination while planning their wedding; from not feeling welcomed to discriminatory terms such as bride’s and groom’s name (Smith, 2013). Although, attitudes regarding the LGBT community have changed and made LGBT couples feel more accepted than they had in the past, a great percentage still feel discrimination against them since previously experiencing poor service in restaurants, hotels and businesses (Pew Research Center, 2013b). Couples reported businesses stopping service or not returning phone calls after learning of the couple’s sexuality (Somerville, 2013). There is the possibility that marketing to same-sex couples could negatively impact the wedding planning business regarding traditional couples; however, embracing same-sex weddings could bring additional business from the more liberal minded or diverse heterosexual couples (Padovani, n.d.). The following are some of the most significant examples of wedding discrimination in the news.   18 In 2012, a lesbian couple tried to book a heterosexual couples farm in upstate New York. When the owners realized they wanted to book a same-sex wedding, they politely declined. The lesbian couple filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights and won. The judge ruled that since the farm was open to the public for seasonal activities, the State of New York was classified as a public accommodation and, therefore, could not discriminate on the basis of certain personal characteristics, including sexual orientation (Harkness, 2014) In 2013, an Oregon bakery refused to make a specialty wedding cake for a lesbian couple. The bakery stated they believed that making a wedding cake for a homosexual couple violated their religious belief that marriage was a sacred union between a man and a woman. The Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries found the bakery owner guilty of discrimination for violating the women’s civil rights (Starr, 2014). A gay couple faced an act of hatred when trying to wed on a beach in Coronado, CA. A neighbor interrupted the ceremony and booed and yelled hate speech from his balcony, disrupting the ceremony and creating an undesirable everlasting moment.  As of April 2015, twenty states enacted the Religious Freedom Reformation Acts (RFRA) based on Federal Law. Of these, Indiana seemed to take their version a step too far. In Section 9, it stated that \"a person,\" in this case meaning an individual, church, limited liability company, etc., \"whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.\" (Montanro, 2015). In other words, while the federal law stated that a person could sue the government for a grievance, Indiana made a point of stating that it did not matter if government was involved. After much   19 backlash and negative press, Indiana Governor Mike Pence stated he was seeking “clarification” and a “fix” to the law with legislation that would make it clear that this law will not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone (Montanro, 2015). Arkansas was almost the 21st state to create a bill that enforced a form of the RFRA. In April 2015, Arkansas’ lawmakers tried to enforce the same law as Indiana with their House Bill 1228. Those in favor of the bill stated the measure would protect religious freedom for business owners and religious leaders. Those against the bill stated HB1228 would allow discrimination specifically against gay, lesbian, and transgender people or protecting religion over equal rights. The House passed the bill; however, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson did not sign the bill stating it needed to be amended. He asked the General Assembly to withdraw the religious freedom bill and make changes and stated the bill should mirror the federal religious freedom restoration act (Dover and Lilley, 2015). This came after major Arkansas-based companies, which included Walmart and Axiom, as well as the bigger cities in Arkansas and their mayors and Chamber of Commerces asked the Governor to veto the bill and stated Arkansas could see a loss in the economy.  Building solid relationships and embracing same-sex weddings The wedding industry had traditionally been seen as stuck in a rut of old traditions. Whereas, same-sex weddings continued to be a growing market, and in order to keep up, businesses had to embrace this niche market (Clarke et al, 2013). A survey from Pew Research (2013b) showed evidence of upcoming decades seeing an even greater acceptance of the LGBT community (Pew Research Center, 2013a). Same-sex couples had long desired to be treated like any other couple. It had been recommended that planners, caterers, photographers, florists, etc. should first remove the word ‘bride’ and embrace ‘engaged couple’ (Hamm, 2014). Reinforcing   20 this was the fact that the majority of same-sex couples planned their wedding together and 72% of engaged same-sex couples looked for wedding professionals with LGBT-inclusive language in their marketing (Smith, 2013). To further advance business acceptance, advertisements, websites and marketing materials should be modernized with same-sex photos and gender neutral wording such as ‘partners’ to appear more ‘gay-friendly’ to cater to modern day weddings (Hamm, 2014; Padovani, n.d.). In addition, wedding professionals should also expand their thinking of all couples as bride-groom, bride-bride or groom-groom, but keeping in mind, some same-sex couples also want to be free of labels and traditions (Hamm, 2014). The sort of non-traditions that evolved with same-sex weddings created more opportunities for the wedding industry through being creative and trying new things; while challenging, this was good for the wedding industry (Blake, 2014). Businesses needed to adapt and recognize the potential benefits same-sex weddings brought to the wedding industry. 14 stories Gay Wedding Institute provides a list of five things businesses can do to prepare for same-sex weddings: 1. Update your marketing materials, contact form, wedding planner worksheet/timeline and contract to remove the terms “bride and groom” and substitute gender-neutral alternatives throughout. 2. Identify a marriage equality or LGBT charitable organization in your service area, volunteer with them and if possible make donations and sponsor events. If you want the business of same-sex couples, then help fight for their rights. 3. Add sexual orientation and gender identity to your corporate (or even small business) anti-discrimination policy if it’s not already there! If you own a small business and don’t have an anti-discrimination policy, then make one.   21 4. Make a list of LGBT-friendly wedding professionals in your service area that you are 100% confident will treat your clients with respect, and consider this your new LGBT client vendor referral list. 5. Are all of the photos in your portfolio of only brides and grooms paired together? Find photos that are more inclusive and use some of those instead, such as the bride by herself or the groom by himself, which are more ambiguous.                     22 CHAPTER 3:  METHODOLOGY  Research Design Planning and development for the research design began in Fall 2014. An extensive literature review in combination with the objectives and purpose of this study (to determine if there is a significant difference in the amount of money spent on same-sex weddings versus heterosexual weddings) was used as the guideline to build the questionnaire. A quantitative approach was used in this study in order to develop a non-experimental research design for the purpose of determining if same-sex wedding spending compared to heterosexual wedding spending. The research design used for this study consisted of a non-experimental descriptive survey, for the purpose of assessing traditions, wedding costs and challenges faced during the wedding process. Because typical survey studies were used to assess attitudes, preferences, opinions, practices, procedures and demographics (Gay & Airasian, 2003), a descriptive survey research design was deemed appropriate for this study. An approval form for research involving human subjects was submitted to the Institutional Review Board. The approval form was accepted and approved in December 2014 (See Appendix A). A descriptive questionnaire survey was designed and distributed to the members of a focus group. The results of the focus group yielded small changes, which were made (See Appendix B). The members of the focus group consisted of three hospitality faculty, four heterosexual women and three male members of the LGBTQ community. Population and Sample Selection  The target population selected for analysis included a dual population sample of heterosexual and same-sex newlyweds or engaged individuals. As it would be impossible to   23 survey every individual who is getting married or recently married, snowball sampling was used to collect the data. Due to not all states having legalized same-sex marriage, the researcher felt that using snowball sampling would allow for a wider representation that would reach more individuals from multiple regions of the U.S. Heterosexual individuals were found through acquaintances, wedding planner listservs, bridal fair attendees, and via social media (Facebook). Similarly, LGBTQ individuals were established through acquaintances, wedding planner listervs, social media (Facebook) and LGBTQ websites. Instrumentation A self-administered online survey was developed in order to measure the difference between heterosexual wedding costs and LGBTQ wedding costs, in addition, questions related to challenges and traditions were measured. Questions focused on: 1) demographics, 2) traditions, 3) occurrence of spending and cost during the wedding process and 4) obstacles and challenges during the wedding planning and ceremony. The questionnaire included Likert scales along with various questions associated with wedding planning, purchasing and various demographic questions. The instrument design consisted of a descriptive survey which was developed based on the review of literature and the results of a focus group consisting of four heterosexual women, who had recently been married, and three gay men, of which one was married and two were planning their wedding. The focus group was used to test the content validity, reliability and clarity of the questionnaire as well as to determine if one survey could be used for both populations. As a result of the focus group, there were changes made to the questionnaire. Several wedding aspects were suggested by the heterosexual women, which included adding reception, videographer and family to the tradition and spending sections. Next, corrections and changes were made to the obstacles and challenges scale after it was confirmed to have   24 confusing choices. Also, all the LGBTQ men had suggestions for the demographics section. The word ‘identified’ was added to two questions relating to gender and sex and ‘partnered’ was added under relationship status. Measures The study engaged a four-section survey. The first section of the survey focused on wedding traditions, the meaning of a wedding, length of wedding planning, who was involved in the wedding planning, the wedding venue. In addition, a yes or no table was included, which asked about multiple ‘traditions’ (i.e. proposal, attire, reception, cake cutting, honeymoon, etc.). Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used on the yes and no table to compare wedding traditions of heterosexual and LGBTQ respondents. A mean comparison of wedding traditions between groups was also used. Section two consisted of wedding spending questions such as wedding budget, how the wedding was paid for, the biggest expense, number of guests and miles traveled to wedding location. The last part of section two involved a table that consisted of wedding items (rings, attire, venue, photographer, caterer) and the amount spent on each item. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and mean comparisons to conclude which wedding expense was the greatest for both heterosexuals and LGBTQ respondents. ANOVA was used to determine significant differences in spending between these two groups.  The third section focused on obstacles and challenges the participants faced during the wedding process. The first half of this section involved a 6-point Likert scale ranking ease of finding wedding vendors (venue, caterer, florist, photographer) from ‘difficult’ to ‘easy’. The second part of this section included a 6-point Likert scale, which consisted of experiences that involved behaviors encountered during the planning session and at the wedding (discrimination,   25 family interference, religious variations, cultural differences, guest behavior). Descriptive statistics including frequencies were used to determine if either group experienced any obstacles or challenges during the wedding process. ANOVA was used to determine significant differences between groups.  The fourth and final section asked demographic questions as related to the respondent, which consisted of age, gender questions (biological sex; identify with self), race/ethnicity, home state and state in which married, occupation, education level and household income. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the mean, standard deviation, frequencies and percentages of each item. The average age was 37.50 for participants with a mean of 3.21, with a standard deviation of .879.  Data Collection Techniques  The planned method of data collection used both probability and snowball sampling (chain-referral). Sampling consisted of the researcher contacting wedding planners in Arkansas as well as Arkansas bridal fair coordinators with the request that they forward the survey on their listservs for past and current brides, and attendees. In addition, researchers’ contacted LGBTQ wedding planners and expositions for access to their listservs. The potential participants were asked to go online, complete the survey as well as forward the survey to all of their engaged or newly married friends (same-sex or heterosexual). The researcher also used snowball sampling. The survey was emailed to the researcher’s personal LGBTQ community acquaintances requesting they forward the survey to their LGBT friends and associates. Additionally, the researcher utilized social media websites such as Facebook to post the survey and also asked numerous national equality centers and LGBTQ sites to include the survey in their postings, email listservs, websites and electronic newsletters.    26 Data Analysis  The collected data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, percentages, frequencies and ANOVA. Data was coded and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., 2014). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze a demographic profile of respondents. Demographic data was tabulated using percentages and frequencies.   Data produced from research question one and two was also analyzed using descriptive statistics, percentages and frequencies to describe how same-sex wedding spending compared to heterosexual wedding spending. The first part of research question one identified the wedding budget for each group followed by wedding spending for specific wedding items. ANOVA was used to find significant differences between groups in spending items on research question one. Research question two was more specific to find the biggest expense in a wedding for both groups.  Next, descriptive statistics were used in response to data produced from research question three in regards to comparing obstacles and challenges couples face during the wedding process between heterosexuals and LGBTQ respondents. ANOVA was also used to find significant differences of obstacles and challenges between groups.  For data produced from research question four, asking wedding traditions of heterosexual and LGBTQ respondents. Descriptive statistics and mean comparison and differences were used describe wedding traditions.   The previous chapter discussed the research methodologies that were used to investigate four research questions. By utilizing methods of statistical analysis, this chapter presents the results of the survey developed to answer these research questions. Several of these questions involve descriptive statistics, including demographic profiles.   27  The objective of this study was to determine if there was a significant difference in the amount of money spent on same-sex weddings versus heterosexual weddings. In addition, this study explored spending patterns, obstacles, and traditions associated with weddings of heterosexual and same-sex marriages. The same-sex marriage movement for legally recognized unions in the U.S. could provide a huge economic boom in the hospitality and tourism industry via promoting, planning and hosting same-sex weddings. In addition, this study was meant to describe the economic impacts on the wedding industry by legalizing same-sex marriage, to compare spending of same-sex weddings to that of heterosexual weddings and to determine if it was financially beneficial for the wedding / hospitality industry to market directly to same-sex couples who are planning a wedding. Response Rate  Snowball sampling was used to collect online surveys via Qualtrics. Snowball sampling as a non-probability sampling technique, which works like a chain referral, used by researchers to identify potential subjects in studies where subjects were hard to locate or the sample was a very small subgroup of the population (Explorable.com, 2009). In the case of this study, due to same-sex marriage not being legal in Arkansas and surrounding states or same-sex marriage recently becoming legal in more and more states and the LGBTQ population representing a very small portion in the U.S., snowballing was chosen as the best method for reaching this population. The researcher reached out to personal connections in the LGBTQ community, the connections would respond to the survey and would then send the survey on to their contacts, etc. Response rate could not be calculated because snowball sampling was used. There was no viable response rate when snowball sampling was used because there was not a specific   28 population size chosen to receive and complete the survey.  However, a total of 162 respondents participated in the study. Of the responses returned, a total of 84 heterosexual responses and 68 LGBTQ responses were deemed usable for a total of 152 usable responses. Respondent Profile  The demographic characteristics of the respondents were described for heterosexual and LGBTQ individuals from around the U.S. There were 84 (55.26%) heterosexual respondents and 68 (44.74%) LGBTQ respondents for a total of 152 respondents. Table 3 below shows the following results.  The largest percentage of heterosexual and LGBTQ respondents were between the ages of 26 and 39. Fifty-four (64.29%) heterosexuals and 29 (43.28%) LGBTQ were between the ages of 26 and 39 for a total of 83 (54.97%) total respondents. The next highest percentage of heterosexual respondents were between the ages of 18 and 25 with 20 (23.81%); only seven (10.45%) LGBTQ. However, the second highest age group for LGBTQ respondents were the 40 to 49 age group, which totaled 16 (23.88%) respondents closely followed by the 50 + age group, with 15 (22.39%). There were no respondents under the age of 18.  Respondents were asked to identify their race or ethnic background with which they most closely associated themselves. White or Caucasian was the most chosen ethnic category with 138 (90.79%) respondents. Of these, 78 (92.56%) were heterosexual and 60 (88.24%) were LGBTQ. Hispanic/Latino was the option with the next highest number, totaling five (3.29%) respondents that were categorized as two (2.38%) heterosexual and three (4.41%) LGBTQ. There were four (2.63%) respondents who considered themselves as “other”, one (1.19%) heterosexual and three (4.41%) LGBTQ. Only two (2.38%) respondents identified with Native American (both heterosexual). The same for Asian Pacific; only two (1.32%) chose this ethnicity with one   29 (1.19%) heterosexual and one (1.47%) LGBTQ. Only one (0.66%) respondent chose Black/African American marking the LGBTQ category. The largest percentage of respondents resided in Arkansas, totaling 73 (48.34%); of these, 53 (63.86%) were heterosexuals and 20 (29.41%) were LGBTQ. For the heterosexual respondents, Texas was the second state with the most respondents (10 or 12.05%). California was the second largest state represented by the LGBTQ respondents with 12 (17.65%) followed by the state of New York with 6 (8.82%) of this group. In order to gain a better understanding of the respondents’ relationship status, they were asked to select the term that best described their current relationship:  engaged, legally married, partnered, common-law, civil union, registered domestic partner or other. Of 150 respondents, 95 (63.33%) stated that they were ‘Legally married’; of these, 48 (57.83%) were heterosexual and 47 (70.15%) were LGBTQ making this category the majority of each group. There were 29 (19.33%) ‘Engaged’ respondents; 20 (24.10%) were heterosexual and nine (13.43%) were LGBTQ. Fourteen respondents chose ‘other’ ten were heterosexual (12.05%) and four (5.97%) were LGBTQ. Some of the ‘other’ responses from these participants included: “We are domestic partners in Arkansas, but it isn’t recognized”; “We are engaged to get married in the next 3 months”; “Married legally at Federal level, not recognized by state”; “Married where legal, partner in all other states.” Four (4.82%) heterosexual and seven (10.45%) LGBTQ chose ‘Partnered’ for a total of 11 (7.33%) respondents. Only one (1.20%) heterosexual chose ‘Common-law’. None of the respondents chose ‘Civil union’ or ‘Registered domestic partner’. The respondents were then asked to identify their occupation. The overall largest percentage held a ‘professional’ occupation with a total of 73 (48.03%) out of 152 respondents. This was also the highest occupation held in both heterosexual (41, 48.81%) and LGBTQ (32,   30 47.06%) respondents. The next highest percentage of respondents were classified as ‘management’ with a total of 21 (13.82%) respondents; ten (11.90%) heterosexual and 11 (16.18%) LGBTQ. The occupation of ‘education’ was held by 14 respondents (9.21%) three (3.57%) heterosexual and 11 (16.18%) LGBTQ. ‘Sales’ and ‘student’ each had a total of ten (6.58%) responses each; eight (9.52%) heterosexual and two (2.94%) LGBTQ in each category. Five (5.95%) heterosexual respondents and two (2.94%) LGBTQ respondents chose ‘self-employed’ or ‘business owner’ for a total of seven respondents (4.61%). In the ‘other’ occupation category, four (4.17%) heterosexuals and two (2.94%) LGBTQ respondents chose this category for a total of six (3.95%) respondents. Five (3.29%) respondents were ‘unemployed’; two (2.38%) heterosexuals and three (4.41%) LGBTQ. ‘Clerical’ respondents totaled four (2.63%) responses. Out of these, three (3.57%) were heterosexual and one (1.47%) was LGBTQ. Two (2.94%) respondents were ‘retired’, both of which were LGBTQ. None of the respondents were employed in the ‘military’. In terms of education level, the largest percentage of survey respondents, 64 (42.11%), had received a ‘Bachelor’s degree’, with the next highest number, 42 (27.63%), holding a ‘Graduate or professional degree’. Forty-one (48.81%) of the ‘Bachelor’s degrees’ were held by heterosexuals, while 23 (33.82%) were LGBTQ. Among ‘Graduate and Professional degrees’, 14 (16.67%) were held by heterosexuals while 28 (41.18%) were LGBTQ. ‘Some college but no degree’ made up the third largest category with ten (11.90%) heterosexuals and eight (11.76%) LGBTQ, for a total of 18 (11.84%) respondents. Sixteen (10.53%) respondents had an ‘Associates/Technical degree’; this was comprised of 12 (14.29%) heterosexuals and four (5.88%) LGBTQ. Only eight (5.26%) of the respondents held a ‘Doctorate degree’; each included 4 four (4.76%) heterosexuals and four (5.88%) LGBTQ. The smallest categories were   31 ‘other’, meaning someone not enrolled in a degree-seeking track, or ‘high school’; with a total of two (2.38%) heterosexual respondents. In order to make a connection of wedding spending totals, respondents were asked for their income levels. The largest majority of respondents made $100,000 to $149,999. Both heterosexual and LGBTQ had 20 (24.10% heterosexual and 29.41% LGBTQ) respondents each for a total of 40 (26.49%) in this income category. In the $50,000 to $74,999 category, there were 30 (19.87%) total respondents, which included 18 (21.69%) heterosexuals and 12 (17.65%) LGBTQ. The third highest income level category was both $25,000 to $49,999 and $75,000 to $99,999 with each having 25 (16.56%) total respondents.

The independent variables were the heterosexual and LGBTQ groups and the dependent variables were each specific wedding expense. Of the 20 wedding expenses given, four were found to be statistically significant at the .05 significance level: Rings: F (1, 143) = 14.331 with a significant difference of .000; Attire: F (1, 141) = 13.208 with a significant difference of .000; Photographer: F (1, 140) = 4.558 with a significant difference of .034; and Florist/Flowers: F (1, 138) = 6.552 with a significant difference of .012. In all categories, it was found the heterosexuals spent more money.   TABLE 4.3 ANOVA SUMMARY OF WEDDING EXPENSES BETWEEN  HETEROSEXUALS AND LGBTQ    Sum of Squares Df Mean Square F Sig.

In order to specifically define wedding expenses, respondents were asked to identify their largest wedding expense. Table 4.5 identifies each type of wedding related expense as well as the number of heterosexual and LGBTQ respondents who chose each expense. Both heterosexuals and LGBTQ respondents chose Food and Beverage as the greatest expense; 22 (26.51%) of the 83 heterosexuals and 17 (25.76%) of the 66 LGBTQ respondents for a combined total of 39 or 26.17% of total respondents. The next highest total expense was the reception with a combined total of 23 (15.44%) of all the respondents followed by ring expense of 22 (14.77%) of all the respondents. The reception expense was the second highest expense for heterosexual respondents (14 or 16.89%) followed by the ring expense (12 or 14.46%). Similarly, the second highest expense for LGBTQ respondents was the ring expense (10 or 15.15%) followed by the reception expense (9 or 13.64%) and honeymoon (9 or 13.64%).            56 TABLE 4.5 WHERE THE MAJORITY OF MONEY IS SPENT IN HETEROSEXUAL AND LGBTQ WEDDINGS   Heterosexual  LGBTQ    n Percentage  n Percentage Total Percentage Attire 4 4.82%  2 3.03% 6 4.03% Rings 12 14.46%  10 15.15% 22 14.77% Wedding Venue 11 13.25%  5 7.58% 16 10.74% Reception Venue 3 3.61%  4 6.06% 7 4.70% Photographer 6 7.23%  2 3.03% 8 5.37% Food and Beverage 22 26.51%  17 25.76% 39 26.17% Rehearsal Dinner 0 0.00%  1 1.51% 1 0.67% Reception 14 16.89%  9 13.64% 23 15.44% Honeymoon 9 10.84%  9 13.64% 18 12.08% Other 2 2.41%  7 10.61% 9 6.04% Total 83 100%  66 100% 149 100%   Respondents were asked to identify specific amounts spent on wedding items ranging in cost from $0 to $3,000+.

To make comparisons of obstacles and/or challenges faced by both heterosexual and LGBTQ couples during the wedding planning process, respondents were asked to rank the following in terms of organization: finding a venue, caterer, florist, photographer, videographer, planner, officiate, financial means, wedding attire and transportation. A 6-point Likert scale was used to rank these components from difficult to easy. (See Table 4.7).

The independent variables were the heterosexual and LGBTQ groups and the dependent variables were the specific obstacle or challenge. Out of the 20 wedding obstacles and challenges given, five were found to be statistically significant at the .05 significance level: Finding a Florist: F (1, 143) = 6.798 with a significant difference of .010; Finding a Videographer: F (1, 144) = 6.279 with a significant difference of .013; Finding a Planner: F (1, 143) = 6.731 with a significant difference of .010; Family Interference: F (1, 143) = 3.993 with a significant difference of .048 and Religious Variations: F (1, 142) = 6.244 with a significant difference of .014. The significant difference in finding a florist was found with most heterosexual respondents chose ‘easy’ and most LGBTQ respondents chose ‘not applicable’. For finding a videographer and planner, more LGBTQ chose ‘not applicable’. The significant difference for family interference and religious variations was found in more heterosexual respondent rankings.            67 TABLE 4.9 ANOVA SUMMARY OF OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES BETWEEN HETEROSEXUALS AND LGBTQ  Obstacles  Sum of Squares Df Mean Square F Sig.

To see if past wedding traditions are still being followed by both populations, respondents were asked to identify whether they followed the more common now wedding traditions by answering ‘yes’ or ‘no’. This list of wedding traditions was comprised through the literature review. The list of wedding traditions included: proposal, proposal with ring, engagement photos, wedding photos, showers, rehearsal dinner, wedding dress, tuxedo, suits, bridesmaid/groomsmen, exchange of rings during the ceremony, reception, throw a bouquet, cut a cake, garter toss, and involve something old, new, borrowed and blue. (See Table 4.11).  Regarding the wedding tradition, the proposal, 122 (82.99%) of the 147 total respondents stated ‘yes’ they participated in this tradition. Seventy-four (90.24%) of these were heterosexuals and 48 (73.85%) LGBTQ respondents. Seventeen (26.15%) of the 65 LGBTQ respondents did not have a traditional wedding proposal. In addition, each group stated they had a proposal that involved a ring. Seventy-two (86.75%) heterosexual and 34 (51.51%) LGBTQ respondents indicated a ring was involved with the wedding proposal. However, 32 or 48.49% of the LGBTQ respondents said they did not have a proposal with a ring.   There were differences in the wedding tradition of engagement photographs. Fifty-nine (71.08%) heterosexuals stated they took engagement photos followed by 24 (28.92%) who did not take any engagement photos. Of the LGBTQ respondents, 47 (71.21%) stated they did not take engagement photographs and only 19 (28.79%) took any sort of engagement photos. Wedding portraits, however, did have similarities in that the largest percentage of both groups stated they did participate in this wedding tradition. One-hundred-seventeen (78.00%) out of 150   71 total respondents had wedding portraits, of these 65 (78.31%) were heterosexual and 52 (77.61%) were LGBTQ.  As far as traditional showers such as an engagement shower or bridal shower, 70 (85.37%) heterosexual respondents stated they had at least one shower compared to only 16 (19.05%) of LGBTQ respondents. Fifty (75.76%) of the LGBTQ population did not have any type of shower. The wedding tradition of having a rehearsal dinner indicated that numbers were split between heterosexuals (68 or 80.95%) having had a rehearsal dinner; whereas, forty (60.60%) of the LGBTQ respondents did not have a rehearsal dinner. However, 26 (39.40%) of the LGBTQ population indicated they had a rehearsal dinner prior to their wedding.  Attire for the wedding day as a wedding tradition varied among the populations. The respondents who wore a wedding dress were 78 (93.98%) heterosexuals and 25 (38.46%) LGBTQ. The majority of LGBTQ respondents did not wear a wedding dress. It should be noted that of the 40 (61.54%) LGBTQ individuals who did not wear a wedding dress, 26 (65%) were gay men. Further, those that rented, purchased or borrowed tuxedos, were mainly heterosexuals with 44 (53.66%); however, 38 (46.34%) did not wear a tuxedo. Within the LGBTQ respondents, 54 (81.82%) stated not having worn tuxedos. Of these LGBTQ respondents, 22 (40.74%) were gay men and 18 (33.33%) lesbian women. For those having worn a suit, 100 (68.03%) of the total 147 respondents stated ‘yes’ they had worn a suit as opposed to a tuxedo. The answer ‘yes’ was the most common answer put forth by both groups with 61 (76.25%) of heterosexuals and 38 (56.72%) of LGBTQ respondents supporting suits versus tuxedos. Though, for the LGBTQ respondents, close behind was the answer ‘no’ to the suits with 28 (41.79%). Within the LGBTQ respondents, 17 (44.74%) gay men and 10 (26.32%) lesbian women chose   72 ‘yes’ and 11 (39.29%) gay men and 12 (42.86%) lesbian women chose ‘no’ when asked if they had worn a suit to their wedding. Respondents were asked whether their wedding had included bridesmaids and groomsmen. The largest percentage of the heterosexuals (70 or 84.34%) stated they had bridesmaids and/or groomsmen. Thirty-four (51.52%) of the LGBTQ respondents had bridesmaids and/or groomsmen in their wedding ceremony as opposed to 32 (48.48%) who did not.  The bulk of each group had a ring exchange during their ceremony. Eighty (97.56%) were heterosexuals and 62 (92.54%) were LGBTQ. For those that involved something old, new, borrowed and blue, the results varied. Most of the heterosexuals (64, 79.01%) chose ‘yes’, indicating they had participated in this wedding tradition, leaving 17 (20.99%) stating they had not participated in something old, new, borrowed and blue. LGBTQ respondents were split with 39 (60.94%) who had not participated in this tradition and 25 (39.06%) who had participated. The answers regarding the wedding reception question was dominated by ‘yes’ for both groups. Seventy-eight (93.98%) of heterosexuals and 57 (85.07%) of LGBTQ had a reception of sorts following their wedding ceremonies. Both populations stated they had held the wedding tradition of cutting a cake. Of these respondents 74 (90.24%) were heterosexual and 44 (66.67%) were LGBTQ. Twenty-two (33.33%) LGBTQ respondents stated they did not have a cake to cut at their reception.  The tradition of the bride throwing a bouquet was performed by 57 (70.37%) heterosexuals and only 13 (19.70%) LGBTQ participants. The majority of LGBTQ respondents (53 or 80.30%) did not throw a bouquet. Within the LGBTQ respondents who did not throw a bouquet, 26 (49.06%) were gay men and 15 (28.30%) were lesbian women. When it came to the   73 traditional wedding garter toss, the majority of heterosexuals (51 or 62.96%) had participated followed by 30 (37.04%) who did not have a garter toss. Fifty-five (83.33%) LGBTQ respondents did not participate in a garter toss. Of those LGBTQ respondents answering this question, 25 (45.45%) were gay men and 16 (29.09%) were lesbian women.

However, the results showed similarities in spending between both groups in the food and beverage and ring spending concluding food and beverage the greatest expense for both heterosexual and LGBTQ respondents in this study. Other findings showed the largest percentage of both groups not having faced many obstacles and challenges during the wedding planning process. Further, several traditions stood out in comparing heterosexual and   77 LGBTQ wedding traditions such as the proposal, a ring exchange during the ceremony and having had a reception. Discussion and implications of these findings are discussed in Chapter 5.       78  CHAPTER 5:  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  Summary of Research The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a significant difference in the amount of money spent on same-sex weddings versus heterosexual weddings. The same-sex marriage movement for legally recognized unions in the US could provide a huge economic boost in the hospitality and tourism industry via promoting, planning and hosting same-sex weddings. Additionally, the study sought to find where money was being spent and what these differences were in heterosexual and same-sex spending. The benefits and the economic impact of same-sex marriage could be beneficial to many businesses in the wedding industry. Therefore, venues, bakeries, florists, caterers and others could utilize these results.  The previous chapter elaborated on the research methodologies and statistical analyses that were used to discuss the test results. This chapter provides a summary of the study and conclusions relating to the four research questions followed by discussions of specific findings. In addition, concluded by identifying the implications for same-sex weddings as well as providing suggestions for future research.   The research was conducted in the fall of 2014. An in-depth literature review along with the objectives of this study were used as a guide to build a questionnaire for heterosexual and same-sex individuals who recently married or were currently planning a wedding. A descriptive online questionnaire survey was developed and distributed to a focus group to test for validity, reliability and clarity and to determine if one instrument could be used for both populations. The focus group consisted of four heterosexual women and three gay men. As a result of the focus   79 group, there were changes made to the questionnaire. Several wedding aspects were suggested by the heterosexual women, which included adding reception, videographer and family to the tradition and spending sections. Next, corrections and changes were made to the obstacles and challenges scale after it was confirmed to contain confusing choices. Also, all the LGBT men had suggestions for the demographics section. The word ‘identified’ was added to two questions relating to gender and sex and ‘partnered’ was added under relationship status.  The population used in this study consisted of heterosexual and LGBTQ individuals from around the US who had recently married or were planning to marry. Conclusions There were multiple reasons to study same-sex weddings; the main was the economic longevity of the LGBTQ community has in society. The Williams Institute estimated that the same-sex wedding business in the 16 states most recently affected by court decisions would generate $467 million in spending over the next three years (White, 2014). The disposable income for this group was $830 billion and was continuing to rise (Witeck Communications, 2013). The wedding business was already a $51 billion industry; with 15-16 million adults being LGBTQ. Think of the impact same-sex weddings could add to this number. It was therefore safe to presume that the wedding industry should make investments in same-sex couples planning a wedding since they will be able to comfortably take the time to plan a wedding and have the means to do so.   The average wedding cost in 2013 in the U.S. was $29,858 (XO Group, 2014b). Literature indicated that couples typically spent between $18,900 and $31,500 on their wedding; however, a significant amount of couples spent less than $10,000 on their wedding. This figure did not include the cost of a honeymoon (Cost of Wedding, 2015). Of course, there were the   80 elaborate spenders who topped the scales at $100,000 plus where wedding spending is concerned.    This study focused on wedding spending differences among two populations: heterosexuals and members of the LGBTQ community. The results of this study showed the heterosexual respondents spent more in total cost on their wedding than the LGBTQ respondents with the largest percentage of heterosexuals spending $5,000 to $10,000 compared to LGBTQ spent under $5,000. Another angle showed 61% of heterosexual respondents who spent $5,000 to $25,000 on their wedding compared to 44% of the LGBTQ respondents. While literature stated that wedding budgets ranged from very little money to well over the $100,000 mark, this study found that 34% of heterosexuals budgeted $5,000 to $10,000 for their weddings, followed closely by 28% who budgeted $10,000 to $25,000 and finally, 25% had budgeted to spend less than $5,000 on their wedding. It should be noted that 13% of the heterosexual respondents indicated they had budgeted to spend $25,000 to over $50,000 on their wedding.  It would appear that there was not a large break among heterosexuals and their wedding budgets with only a 5% gap between this group who stated they would budget to spend less than $5,000 on their wedding and those that stated they had budgeted $25,000 and up. So, where was the money for the wedding coming from? The data indicated that 44% of heterosexual respondents paid for their weddings themselves with the help of their fiancé and parents and family this was followed by 27% who stated their parents and family paid for their wedding.  In comparison to heterosexual wedding budgeting, 48% of LGBTQ population surveyed said they budgeted under $5,000 for their wedding. In contrast, 24% of the population recorded they had budgeted $10,000-25,000 for their wedding. Roughly 20% indicated they had budgeted   81 $5,000 to $10,000 and only 8% had budgeted $25,000 to $50,000. None of the LGBTQ respondents indicated they had budgeted over $50,000 on their wedding. Unlike the heterosexual respondents, there was a significant gap between the amounts of money spent on weddings by LGBTQ respondents. This did not come as much of a surprise due to the fact that same-sex marriage laws were changing daily; sometimes hourly. The data showed that 65% of LGBTQ respondents paid for their wedding with just the help of their fiancé.  LGBTQ couples were also rushing to courthouses when the news was announced that same-sex marriage had been approved as legal. Many couples realized that due to the topsy-turvy legislation, lawmakers, and lawsuits that they had a small window of time in which to get legally married. Not all states had same-sex marriage and while a few did have laws established, many states did not. Findings from this study showed 32% of the LGBTQ respondents planned their wedding in less than 3 months compared to 67% of the heterosexual respondents planned from 3 months to 12 months.   On May 9, 2014 in the State of Arkansas, a landmark ruling from Judge Chris Piazza struck down the state's legislative and constitutional ban on same sex marriage. A few days later on May 16, 2014 the Arkansas Supreme Court stayed Judge Piazza's ruling, pending appeal. In five days, more than 500 same sex couples were legally married in Arkansas (THV11, 2015). The ban on same sex marriage was back in place and still is to this day. This ruling was imperative to the outcome of this study as the largest percentage (29%) of the LGBTQ respondents were from the State of Arkansas. Therefore, it was concluded that while heterosexual couples had the freedom to plan and did not have the constant worry about laws causing a delay or cancellation of their wedding, this was not the same for LGBTQ couples, and the immediacy of getting married trumped a traditional ceremony.    82 To advance the knowledge regarding location or area the most money was being spent during the course of the wedding, the results found similarities in the heterosexual and LGBTQ respondents. The largest percentage of each group (27% of heterosexuals and 26% of LGBTQ) stated food and beverage was their biggest expense.  Food and beverage was where the majority of money was spent in a wedding, mainly because this was a chance for the couple to interact and ensure their guests had a good time at their wedding. In this study, both groups spent over $3,000 on food and beverage, 25% of the heterosexuals and 27% of the LGBTQ respondents. Even though the LGBTQ respondents in this study did not appear to have had a traditional wedding ceremony it was proven they were spending money on their guests. It was important to couples (regardless of sexual preference) that family and friends enjoyed the time spent celebrating the couple and making memories; the couples want their guests to have a memorable time. It was notable that out of the 17 LGBTQ respondents spending over $3,000, nine (53%) were gay men and five were lesbian women.  Findings in this study revealed wedding bands were important for both heterosexual couples and same-sex couples. The largest percentage of both heterosexual and LGBTQ respondents spent over $3,000 on wedding rings; 44% of the heterosexuals and 19% of the LGBTQ respondents. The national average spent on engagement rings in 2013 was around $6,000 (XO Group, Inc., 2014b). Fifteen percent of the heterosexual respondents as well as 15% of the LGBTQ respondents also chose rings as their greatest wedding expense. The reception was the part of the wedding where everyone could enjoy and celebrate the newly wedded couple and their future. This study showed 25% of heterosexual respondents and 23% of LGBTQ respondents did not pay for the wedding reception. However, 23% of heterosexuals and 21% of LGBTQ respondents spent over $3,000 with 17% of the heterosexuals   83 and 14% of LGBTQ who chose reception as their greatest expense. One further detail of the LGBTQ respondents, 59% of those who spent over $3,000 on their reception were gay men.  To further conclude if couples faced obstacles or challenges while planning a wedding, respondents were asked to identify their experiences. This included whether it was difficult to find a venue, wedding attire, and dealing with social disproval or cultural differences. The results in this study showed no significant obstacles or challenges were faced during the wedding planning process for heterosexuals or LGBTQ respondents; however, national news reporting showcased plenty of discrimination towards the LGBTQ community in the form of events and laws. Overall, the obstacle category saw the most selections of the ‘easy’ or ‘N/A’ answers than any other question asked on the survey. The largest percentage of both groups ranked each variable in this category as ‘easy’ or ‘N/A’.  Similarly, both groups experienced no challenges during the wedding planning process. The only slight difference was visible by the heterosexuals. When asked if they had experienced too much family interference when planning their wedding, there was a very close margin between ‘somewhat’ and ‘none’ as an answer. In summary, 38% heterosexuals experienced some family interference when planning their nuptials; whereas, the majority of LGBTQ respondents indicated no family interference. Seeing as how 71% of the heterosexual respondents had help paying for the wedding, this could result in family interference. Further, in regards to the LGBTQ respondents not having faced many obstacles and challenges, the largest percentage did not plan the wedding for a long period of time, leading to not having to face or come across any interference and such. According to the results of this study, same-sex couples continued to participate in the old-style tradition of a wedding proposal. Seventy-five percent of the LGBTQ respondents and   84 90% of heterosexual respondents claimed to have had a proposal. However, proposal with a ring was split between the LGBTQ respondents with 52% of this group having had a proposal with a ring and 49% had a proposal without a ring. Perhaps half of these couples did not have a ‘traditional’ engagement and went straight to the courthouse to marry when it became legal in their state. In comparison, 87% of heterosexual respondents had a proposal with a ring. However, it should not be misconstrued that the LGBTQ respondents were in short-term relationships or rushed into a marriage by the lack of a traditional proposal.  Further, the exchanging of rings during the wedding ceremony did not seem to be a tradition that was dead nor would it end anytime soon as it was upheld by the results of this study. Ninety-eight percent of the heterosexual respondents and 93% of LGBTQ respondents in this study exchanged wedding rings during their ceremony.  This wedding tradition of the couple ‘receiving society’ in the form of family and friends otherwise known as the reception is not only an opportunity to celebrate the couples’ union; but, the reception started the couple off on a path of joy and good wishes for a happy and prosperous life. Ninety-four percent of the heterosexuals and 85% of same-sex couples seemed to be following the tradition having had a reception following their weddings. In addition, this study resulted in 90% of heterosexuals and 67% of same-sex couples claiming to have cut a cake on their wedding day. It should be noted that 81% of the LGBTQ respondents were lesbian women who stated they cut a cake on their wedding versus the gay men who were split 50/50 regarding cake cutting. Regarding wedding traditions both heterosexual and same-sex couples followed, it can be concluded from this study, rings, food and beverage and reception (which involves food and   85 beverage) are the areas where the hospitality industry could make the most profit and greatly benefit.  Interesting findings Some results of this study should be noted. First, in regards to state of residence, the majority of heterosexual (64%) were from Arkansas followed by 12% from Texas. Regarding the LGBTQ respondents 29% were from Arkansas followed by 18% from California and 9% from New York. Forty-six percent of the LGBTQ respondents in this study were age 40 to over 50. While the LGBTQ respondents spent less on their weddings, they may have already had a smaller commitment ceremony somewhere or are at a later life stage and have been together for a long time already not seeing a need for a large wedding.  Considering the honeymoon expense, approximately one-third of the heterosexual respondents in this study indicated that they spent over $3,000 on their honeymoon. Similarly, 29% of the LGBTQ respondents did not spend any money (or did not go) on a honeymoon; however, approximately 25% of them spent over $3,000 and the largest percentage of those respondents were gay men. It should also be noted that 17% of the heterosexual respondents did not spend any money on a honeymoon. In comparison to the national average, the cost of a honeymoon was around $4,500 with 62% of couples paying for at least 90% of all honeymoon expenses (Real SizeBride, 2013). According to Sardone (2014) approximately 14% of a couple’s wedding budget was spent on the honeymoon.  Another interesting finding in this study was in regards to a wedding planner. The majority or 64% of heterosexual respondents did not spend any money on a wedding planner, an additional 13% stated N/A (not applicable) or not an option for wedding planner. Similarly for   86 the LGBTQ respondents, 63% spent no money on a wedding planner and further, 28% of this group chose N/A (not applicable) or not an option.  Implications and Limitations Neither group of respondents in this study came close to spending the national average on wedding spending. The average spent on a heterosexual wedding is roughly $30,000 (XO Group, Inc., 2014b) and same sex couples spent an average of $15,849 on their weddings, according to The Knot (White, 2014). However, the data in this study showed both groups to be way below average with 18% of heterosexuals budgeting $5,000 to $10,000 on their weddings, followed by 15% budgeting $10,000 to $25,000 and 14% budgeting less than $5,000; and 22% of the LGBTQ population spent below $5,000. Regarding the Arkansas LGBTQ respondents, it was acceptable to assume they rushed to marry on the one day in May 2014 when same-sex marriage was legal in Arkansas seeing as 32% of the LGBTQ respondents planned their wedding in less than 3 months. The largest percentage of LGBTQ respondents in this study, as well as the heterosexuals, had high levels of education and an income of $100,000-149,999. The study also found same-sex couples spent money on food and beverage and rings. It could be stated these categories are a good representative of where same-sex couples spend money in the industry and businesses involved should recognize and place focus on these areas.    Recommendations for Future Research   This study was largely descriptive because very little had been previously published regarding same-sex weddings from spending to traditions. Because of the recent legalization of same-sex marriage in many states, this research could become the norm. In the future, it may be likely that same-sex weddings will grow bigger and incorporate more of the elements currently   87 associated with heterosexual ceremonies: more time to plan, larger weddings, showers and engagement parties, and more traditions. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that more studies be conducted to find out if same-sex couples spend money on weddings and in what area same-sex couples spend the majority of their money in comparison to heterosexual couples. This will become important and bridge a large gap in the body of knowledge, especially as the legalization of same-sex marriage becomes legal for a sustained amount of time and same-sex couples are not rushing to marry or are worried that what is legal today may not be legal tomorrow.  Additional studies should be performed to determine if same-sex couples are starting to create and follow their own traditions in regard to wedding ceremonies. In addition, with couples becoming more modern and creating new traditions, a study could be conducted in regard to heterosexual couples following age-old wedding traditions to see if some are fading in importance and popularity.  There are several aspects of this study that could be researched further. For example, the time spent planning a wedding in comparison to the amount of money that was spent or the venue chosen. Also, a more in-depth look into a state-by-state breakdown of amounts spent on different wedding aspects as well as a study of the total budget. Additionally, future research should include an analysis of sub-groups within the LGBTQ data, who paid for the wedding and what was their budget. Also, a follow-up survey to ask the respondents when they married and, for the LGBTQ respondents, did they rush to have a ceremony as soon as their state law passed. In summary Currently, 37 states have made same-sex marriage legal and in 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in several marriage legal cases (Freedom to Marry, 2015). A favorable   88 outcome could bring the freedom to marry to same-sex couples nationwide; same-sex couples can have longer planning time and larger weddings. Throughout the world, the growing acceptance of same-sex couples being offered the same opportunities to share legal rights of heterosexual couples explained how marriage was culturally built over the past and what it meant for the current social issue of same-sex marriage (Gallion, 2012; Graff, 2004). In 2004, six in ten Americans were against same-sex marriage compared to 2014 when six in ten were for legalizing same sex marriage (Cillizza, 2013). Across the board, acceptance of same-sex marriage has dramatically increased over the generations. Achieving equality could come to the LGBTQ community through becoming a part of mainstream culture and institutions such as marriage; nevertheless, they should be able to become equal by maintaining their own distinct culture and way of life (Pew Research Center, 2013a). Generation Y and Z are the future of America. How will their views of same-sex marriage change the culture? Is this social movement coming to an end? One of the fastest growing, more dynamic, most loyal, lucrative market segments to pursue is the LGBTQ market. What are we, as the hospitality and tourism industry to do to attract and profit from the LGBTQ community and from same-sex weddings? Research has shown, 55% of LGBTQ consumers would choose to do business with companies that are committed to the diversity/equal treatment of the LGBTQ community (Grace, 2014). Seventy percent of LGBTQ adults stated they would pay a premium for a product from a company that supports the LGBTQ community (Grace, 2014). Further, 78% of LGBTQ friends, family and relatives would switch to brands that are known to be LGBT-friendly (Grace, 2014). So, it comes down to brand loyalty, companies should proactively engage in doing business with LGBTQ   89 owned companies as well as local and national LGBTQ organizations such as equality centers and the Human Rights Campaign.  Due to the large number of respondents in this study being from Arkansas (which is currently not a state that has legalized same-sex marriage), how could this state be impacted? In 2012, wedding spending in Arkansas was estimated from $15,427 to $27.634 in 2012 (Cost of Wedding, 2015). The potential economic impact of same-sex marriage for the first year in Arkansas is $8.7 million (Williams Institute, 2014) not to mention all the employee opportunities this would bring, possibly thousands. What is the economic impact for the rest of the U.S. from the LGBTQ market? For wedding venues, the event profit margin has been estimated to be between 50% and 70% (Loretta, 2014). The LGBTQ community is the largest spending market is the U.S. contributing $56.5 billion to the economy on an annual basis (Hospitality Net, 2013). With these numbers, the U.S. wedding and hospitality industry could potentially see $28 billion to $40 billon in profit from LGBTQ weddings. The Congressional Budget Office found a positive impact on the economy if all 50 states legalized same-sex marriage and was recognized by the federal government, an extra $1 billion each year for the next ten years as well as a small increase in tax revenues at $500 million to $700 million annually (Covert, 2013). Another study estimated the economic impact of all 50 states legalizing same-sex marriage the U.S. would see at the least a $2.5 billion revenue for the local economies (Jasthi, 2014).   It is hard to argue with profits in the billions. It is obvious that financially, same-sex marriage makes good business sense. In contrast, there will always be opponents whose mantras and purposes will vary. This is a high emotion topic, it’s time to make it a financial topic.     90 REFERENCES  Badgett, M.V. L.

    "abstract": "This study investigated if there was a significant difference in the amount of money spent on same-sex weddings versus heterosexual weddings. The results of this study would assist both the wedding and hospitality industry by providing much needed financial and planning information.\nA descriptive, four-section survey was distributed online via Qualtrics utilizing snowball sampling. A total of 152 respondents participated in the study; 84 heterosexual and 68 LGBTQ. The respondents completed the questionnaire that measured wedding traditions, wedding spending, obstacles and challenges faced during their wedding and wedding planning, and demographic information.\nThe results of this study indicated that same-sex couples getting married did not spend as much as heterosexuals. There were certain aspects of spending and traditions that were closely related including the areas of: purchasing food and beverage, purchasing a wedding ring, having a proposal and having a reception. Results also showed that neither group faced obstacles or had any challenges during the course of wedding planning. Lastly, the results revealed potential for increased wedding spending of same-sex couples as they can begin to plan their weddings now that 37 states have legalized same-sex marriage.\nIt is hoped the results from this study will lead to further research resulting in greater awareness of the same-sex wedding market and provide more information about this demographic to the hospitality and tourism industry due to the fact that LGBTQ weddings will provide an additional $33 billion to $46 billion in profit to the industry if all states become legal",
