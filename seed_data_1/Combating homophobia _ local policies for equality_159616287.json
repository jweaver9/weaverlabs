Introduction | 11IntroductionDespite advances in the social situation experienced by lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people1 (LGBT) in recent years in the EU member states, they continue to be the object of discrimination due to the per-sistence of homophobic, transphobic and sexist stereotypes that are deeply ingrained in European societies. For this rea-son it is necessary to continue working to combat these kinds of discrimination in the various spheres of public life. In this endeavour the role of public administrations in collaboration with LGBT associations is a crucial factor to guarantee equal-ity, freedom and respect for the diversity of their citizens re-gardless of sexual orientation and gender expression. Moreover, municipal councils, in coordination with the vari-ous levels of government, have an important and specific task to perform since discrimination against LGBT people operates at a local level, and it is local government which is closest to the citizens. However, those responsible for poli-cies governing equality in local administration often do not know how to act to fight against these kinds of discrimina-tion. Accordingly, the aim of this white paper is to begin to address this problem by providing references for successful local policies to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex-ual orientation and gender identity. Consequently, this white paper hopes to contribute to reinforcing the commitment of local councils to promote equality and civil rights among their citizens.This white paper has been drafted within the framework of the project, Against Homophobia. European Local Admin-istration Devices (AHEAD), co-funded by the Directorate of Fundamental Rights and Citizenship of the European Union and coordinated by Barcelona City Council. The partners who have taken part in this project are the City Councils of Turin and Cologne, the Public Policies and Government Institute (IGOP) (Autonomous University of Barcelona), the Research Centre for Women’s and Gender Studies (CIRSDe) (University of Turin), the Institute of Sociology of the Hungarian Acad-emy of Sciences (MTA SzKI), the Centre for Youth Work Stud-11. For further information on use of terminology, see section 2.1.12  | Combating Homophobia 1. Introduction | 13This is followed by proposed recommendations concerning public policies to combat the kind of discrimination described above at a municipal level. These recommendations are illus-trated with concrete experiences from various European cit-ies. The chapter on good practices describes in further detail those measures adopted by local administrations which are noteworthy for their innovative nature, success in meeting their objectives and for their transferability to other contexts. Finally, there is a bibliography of works cited. ies (CYWS) (Brunel University, West London) and the Catalan association, Creació d’Estudis i Projectes Socials. The contri-bution of this project has been to explore, for the first time, current local policies to combat discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity at a European level. Furthermore, the collaboration between municipal councils and research centres has allowed for feedback between aca-demic research and the experience of local authorities when implementing their policies. This joint effort has proven to be extremely productive.The main objective of this project, beginning January 2010 and ending June 2011, was to promote the implementation of policies aimed at combating discrimination against LGBT people at a local level. In line with this objective, this white paper attempts to serve as a useful tool to highlight the kinds of actions that can be taken by local administration to com-bat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity or expression.Also within the framework of the AHEAD project was the European Rainbow Cities international conference, held on October 14th and 15th, 2010 in Barcelona. The objectives set out during this conference were to reflect on the situation of homophobia and transphobia in the European Union, publicise local public policies that can be used to intervene in cases of these kinds of discrimination and identify the main challenges to these policies. A further objective of this conference was to promote dialogue between local govern-ment, experts and LGBT associations concerning public poli-cies to tackle homophobia and transphobia. The final stage of this project will take place in Turin between the 28th and 29th of April, 2011, where this white paper will be presented.The following section explains the methodology followed to draw up this white paper and gives definitions for some of the terms used here. Chapter 2 provides a succinct descrip-tion of the context by way of a point of departure: the main legislation and public policies in the European Union (EU), an overview of the attitudes towards this social group based on polls conducted at a European level and a synthesis of the main problems encountered in different spheres as well as the situation of people in particularly vulnerable positions. 14  | Combating Homophobia 1. Introduction | 15Methodology1.1There are very few publications concerning policies to combat homophobia and transphobia at the level of local municipalities. Given the absence of previous studies on this issue at a European level,2 this white paper is presented as an initial study and does not purport to be comprehensive. The recommendations and good practices presented here are based on two main sources which are described in the two following subsections: case studies, and research on ex-periences and networks.1.1.1. Case studiesDue to the scarcity of local policies governing LGBT equality, it was decided that the focus of the AHEAD project should not be restricted to compiling previous experiences. Within the framework of the project, those city councils who actual-ly took part implemented a series of innovative local policies, particularly in those areas where they found there was less experience or a need to rethink how to act. The city councils of Barcelona, Turin and Cologne set up case studies along these lines.The Barcelona City Council headed the following case studies:1. Diagnostic and participative procedure for drafting the LGBT Municipal Plan (for further details see good practice 2).2. Introduction to diversity training on gender and sex-ual orientation in training programmes for children and youths outside regular school hours (see section 3.10).3. Diversity training on gender and sexual orientation to homecarers for the elderly (see section 3.12).4. Giving talks in centres for the elderly to promote re-spect for elderly gays and lesbians (see good practice 36).5. Compiling good police practices that have served as a 2. With regard to previous research on a national level, Bertone & Capellato (2006), Cooper & Monro (2003), Monro (2006 & 2007), Monro & Richardson (2010) and Monro, Richardson & McNulty (2010) should be noted concerning policies to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity at a local administration level. basis for recommendations relating to hate crimes.The objective of the Turin City Council initiative was to de-sign and test innovative training models, resulting in four dif-ferent models for courses aimed at the following sectors and institutions:1. Public Space: Turin City Council Municipal Police De-partment (see section 3.4).2. Education: Junior High School (see good practice 24).3. Family: Centre for Relationships and Families of Turin City Council (see section 3.5).4. Social inclusion and immigration: Job Centres in the Province of Turin (see section 3.7).Finally, the Cologne City Council has carried out the follow-ing case studies:1. Diversity strategy: round table discussions that bring people together from different oppressed communities (see good practice 9). 2. Promoting the participation of the LGBT associations in local policy making, in particular through an LGBT work-ing group (see good practice 6). 3. Research into the situation of Rainbow families, that is, families with lesbian, gay or bisexual parents (see sec-tion 3.5).The case studies have served as a basis for contributing new experiences in previously under-explored areas. Similarly, through these case studies it has been possible to learn les-sons and make recommendations, which are set out in the corresponding chapter.1.1.2. Research on experiences and networks The project research group partners (IGOP, CIRSDe, MTA SzKI and CYWS) as well as the Cologne City Council have car-ried out a study to locate and learn about experiences with policies aimed at LGBT equality in city councils in all the EU member states.16  | Combating Homophobia 1. Introduction | 17The fieldwork was based on a survey form addressing local authority departments in municipal governments in which they were asked to explain policies on LGBT equality that they have implemented. This form could be downloaded in any of seven languages from the project’s web page (www.ahead-bcn.org). It was also sent via email and by conven-tional mail to municipal councils, LGBT associations, experts and specialised mailing lists in this area.In addition to the responses and continued distribution ef-forts, the partners in charge of the research divided up the EU countries among themselves. This allowed them to carry out a more detailed search and establish direct contact with those in charge of equality policies in the main councils in their area to find out their experiences with combating dis-crimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.The following obstacles came up when compiling these ex-periences: This is a subject matter which is rarely dealt with by most local administrations. Those which implement these kinds of anti-discriminatory policies tend to be at a state or regional level, while there are relatively few city/town councils that include LGBT matters in their local political agenda.  The majority of city/town councils do not have a specific person to deal with LGBT matters, which means that we often encountered difficulties when trying to get in touch with spokespersons on this matter, even in cases where public policies were known to have been implemented. Once contact was made with those in charge of policies aimed at LGBT equality, it was difficult to get them to complete the form because of the pressure of work loads.In addition to dealing with these obstacles, which were more difficult to overcome in some countries, other stumbling blocks need to be pointed out, which have generated an uneven distribution in the results of the experiences found: Language barriers, since we have not been able to cor-respond with all countries in their own language. This may have generated a communication barrier as not eve-ryone was proficient in the lingua franca used in these cases, namely English. The evolution of equality policies differs widely depend-ing on the country. Consequently, the municipalities in countries with a longer tradition of equality policies are more visible in this white paper, since they tend to reflect more innovative experiences. The distribution of political power across the various ad-ministrative levels affects to what degree city councils can implement policies of this nature. In countries where city councils have restricted powers in the area of anti-discrim-ination we came across fewer experiences at a local level.3  There are also countries, such as Italy, where the lack of State parliamentary law against homophobia and transphobia has spurred some of the regional and/or local authorities to intervene in this vacuum through policies and actions in favour of LGBT people. It should be borne in mind that these local policies and actions cannot be a substitute for a national state policy because they only affect inhabitants of particular municipalities or regions and not the country as a whole. In short, when analysing these kinds of policies it is essential to bear in mind differ-ent levels of government.In the end, it was possible to compile data from a total of 107 experiences. However, given the obstacles and the ex-ploratory nature of this research, it cannot be taken as a de-finitive map of the measures being carried out by EU member state municipal councils.1.1.3. Choosing good practicesIn this context, good practices are defined as public policies that can be considered as a point of reference because they meet three criteria: they are innovative, have been successful and they can be transferred to other contexts. Good prac-tices have been chosen from among the case studies, the wide range of experiences compiled and networks that have been identified.3. For example, political power is quite centralised in Ireland, with major policy decisions and directives being set by central government, and little power devolved to local authorities, with the exception of providing municipal services. Given this context, LGBT groups have not targeted local authorities for service provision or for major policy changes.18  | Combating Homophobia 1. Introduction | 19These criteria formed the basis for selecting the practices set out here and also reflect a certain degree of heterogeneity concerning where these practices are in operation (coun-try and city) and the areas in which action has been taken. So, efforts have been made to avoid over-representing geo-graphical areas and subject matter. In addition, when choos-ing good practices, an attempt was made to look for vari-ety regarding how they fitted in with administration policies (within a specific programme, in relation to other focuses on inequality…), the degree of local authority involvement (symbolic support, backing, leadership…) and the level of participation (mainstreaming,4 cooperation among adminis-trations, public participation etc.)These initiatives can be found in the chapter on good prac-tices. Other experiences considered to be of interest have served as a basis for illustrative examples in the chapter on recommendations.An interesting consideration for future research would be to draw up a more in-depth assessment of good practices, al-lowing for the opinions of the different parties involved and internal assessment reports.4. Mainstreaming is understood here as including the LGBT perspective in policies taken as a whole by a given administration.Clarification of terms used1.2Below is a glossary of specific terms and corresponding definitions which appear repeatedly throughout this document, the objective being to facilitate understand-ing for those readers who are not familiar with this area and to clarify the meaning associated with the use of these terms.• Bisexuality refers to someone able «to be emotionally and/or sexually attracted to individuals of more than one sex» (Takács, 2006).• Discrimination refers to the «less favourable treatment of a person or group than another on various grounds, including sexual orientation (direct discrimination), or where an apparently neutral provision is liable to disad-vantage a group of persons on the same grounds of dis-crimination, unless objectively justified (indirect discrimi-nation)» (FRA, 2009). • Gender expression is, «the expression of oneself as a woman or a man (or both or neither) in external pres-entation and/or appearance through behaviour, clothing, hair-cut, voice, body characteristics, etc.» (Takács, 2006). Gender expression is strongly conditioned by social ex-pectations that people have about how men and women must behave. Gender expression does not have to be fixed or to coincide necessarily with the person’s sex or gender identity.• Gender identity «refers to each person’s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appear-ance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other expressions of gender, including dress, speech and mannerisms. Gender identity is not the same as sexual orientation, and transgender persons may identify as het-erosexual, bisexual or homosexual» (FRA, 2009).• Hate crime «toward LGBT persons refers to any crimi-nal offence, including offences against persons or prop-20  | Combating Homophobia 1. Introduction | 21erty, where the victim, premises or target of the offence were selected because of their real or perceived connec-tion, attachment, affiliation, support or membership of an LGBT group» (FRA, 2009).• Hate speech «refers to public expressions which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred, discrimination or hostility towards minorities – for example statements by political or religious leaders appearing in the press or the Internet» (FRA, 2009).• Heteronormativity is defined as «the perceived rein-forcement of certain beliefs about the taken-for-granted alignment of sex, gender and sexuality by many social in-stitutions. These beliefs include the notion that human beings fall into two distinct and complementary catego-ries, male and female; that sexual and marital relations are normal only when they occur between people of dif-ferent sexes; that intimate relationships between same-sex people don’t have a sexual value; [or] that each sex has certain natural roles in life. Thus, heteronormativity can be considered a set of social rules that influence het-erosexual people that don’t strictly fit into these norms as well» (Gusmano, 2008: 474).• Heterosexuality is the emotional, romantic or sexual attraction towards people of the opposite sex.• Homophobia «is the irrational fear of and aversion to homosexuality and to lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people based on prejudice» (FRA, 2009). • Homosexuality is the emotional, romantic or sexual attraction towards people of the same sex.• Intersex refers to people with an intermediate or atypi-cal combination of physical features attributed to males and females that can involve uncommon chromosome combination, genetic or gonodal variability or develop-mental sexual differences.• LGBT is the acronym used to refer collectively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.• Sexual orientation refers to «each person’s capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender» (FRA, 2009). • Transgender people «includes those people who have a gender identity which is different to the gender assigned at birth and those people who wish to portray their gen-der identity in a different way to the gender assigned at birth. It includes those people who feel they have to, or prefer or choose to, whether by clothing, accessories, cosmetics or body modification, present themselves dif-ferently to the expectations of the gender role assigned to them at birth. This includes, among others, transsexual and transgender people, transvestites, cross dressers, no gender or gender queer people» (Transgender Europe5).• Transphobia «can be described as an irrational fear of gender non-conformity or gender transgression, such as a fear of, or aversion to, masculine women, feminine men, cross-dressers, transgenderists, transsexuals and others who do not fit into existing gender stereotypes about their birth gender. The use of the word ‹phobia› in this context is not intended to imply that the transphobic per-sons and/or the victim of transphobia are suffering from a disorder» (FRA, 2009). • Transsexual «is a person who prefers another gender than their birth gender and feels the need to undergo physical alterations to the body to express this feeling, such as hormone treatment and/or surgery» (FRA, 2009). Transsexual women are those who move from male to female (MtF), while transsexual men are those who move from female to male (FtM).• Transsexuality describes the fact of identifying oneself with the gender opposite to the one socially assigned in accordance with sexual characteristics.5.

Context | 25ContextThe main objective of this chapter is to provide local authority policy makers with useful information which highlights the most important contextual considera-tions when implementing measures aimed at LGBT equality.626. For a comprehensive description and more detailed information on specific aspects, see: FRA (2008, 2009) and others.Legislation and public policies against homophobia and transphobia in the EU2.1This section covers the focal points of EU policies and legislation regarding discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. Firstly, it covers European institutions legislation followed by an overview of legislation relating to LGBT people in member states.Before going into more detail regarding the EU sphere in particular, a few brief points need to be noted from the per-spective of international institutions on questions relating to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gen-der identity. These are set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which serves as a basic point of reference at an international level. Questions relating to LGBT people began to come to light as of the 1990s in hu-man rights forums and began to be considered as such. The most comprehensive document on the rights of LGBT people at an international level is the Yogyakarta Principles (2007)7 (commissioned by the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights), which sets out a series of principles concern-ing how to apply international legislation on human rights to questions relating to sexual orientation and gender identity.2.1.1 European InstitutionsAs regards the EU, actions taken in the area of non-discrim-ination have focused on preventing discrimination on the grounds of nationality and sex. In 1997 the member states 7. The Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. Available at http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/2. Context | 2726  | Combating Homophobiasigned the Treaty of Amsterdam, which in article 13 granted the Commission new powers to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial/ethnic origin, religion/beliefs, dis-ability or sexual orientation. Since 1999, when the Treaty of Amsterdam came into effect, two European Commission directives have established EU anti-discriminatory legisla-tion: the Racial Equality Directive, 2000/43/EC, and the Em-ployment Equality Directive, 2000/78/EC. The Employment Equality Directive sets out a general framework for equality in employment and training irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation in employment, training and membership and involvement in worker or employer organisations. Some European countries have extended the protection against discrimination to some of the other ar-eas included in the Racial Equality Directive (education, so-cial protection, social advantages, membership and access to goods, including housing). The principles of non-discrimination on the grounds of sex-ual discrimination are particularly important when interpret-ing other directives, such as the Free Movement Directive (2004/38/EC), the Qualification Directive (2004/83/EC) and the Family Reunification Directive (2003/86/EC). The ques-tions posed in the interpretation of these directives concern how the term «spouse» should be considered and the rec-ognition of same-sex relationships. This recognition is impor-tant, as it implies denial of or access to the rights set out by the aforementioned directives such as family reunification, the right to asylum or change of residence within the EU.EU institutions have made very little mention of the question of transsexuality. The first time was in 1989, when the Euro-pean Parliament adopted a specific position over the ques-tion of transsexuality through the Resolution of September 12 on discrimination against transsexual people, based on a previous recommendation by the Council of Europe.8 This resolution urges EU member states to establish legislation that allows for changing one’s name and reference to sex in official documents and to combat discrimination against transsexuals. The most recent measure adopted by the Euro-pean Parliament was last June (2010) with the adoption of the Figueiredo report on equality between men and women, 8. Recommendation 1117 on the condition of transsexuals. Available at https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1476365 (October 2010).9. European Union’s 2006-2010 Roadmap for equality between women and men, by Ilda Figueiredo, and adopted by the European Parliament, 17th June 2010. Available at http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/employment_and_social_policy/equality_between_men_and_women/c10404_en.htm (October 2010).which in one of its amendments urges member states to take further action in the area of the rights of transgender people.9Until 2004 discrimination on the grounds of gender identity or expression was not mentioned explicitly in EU legislation; the first explicit mention was in the Directive 2004/83/EC. However, prior to this, the Court of Justice of the Europe-an Union had made various rulings in which it was pointed out that the principle of equality between men and women must be interpreted in a wider context, including protection against discrimination towards transgender people. Conse-quently, nowadays some of the European directives against discrimination include transgender people when referring to equality between men and women.Most of the advances made in soft law10 have originated ei-ther from the Council of Europe or the European Court of Hu-man Rights. As regards the Council of Europe, in the Report on Human Rights and Gender Identity11 (2009) sets out that legally recognising gender identity and the name of transgen-der people should not be governed by requirements such as nullifying marriage, sterilisation or any other kind of medical treatment. Finally, Resolution 1728 concerning Discrimination on the grounds of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (2010) proposes the inclusion of gender in anti-discrimination legislation and that transgender people are guaranteed the option of changing their name and gender.2.1.2. Legislation at the national levelThe majority of EU member states have incorporated the anti-discrimination directives12 into their own civil or labour laws. In some countries the legal provisions against discrimination are allowed for in different legislative bodies; nevertheless, this has evolved in the direction of generating legislation against discrimination of a more general nature that includes all or various types of discrimination. In many EU member states the idea that all kinds of discrimination must be protected against on an equal footing has influenced how European directives on equality have been implemented (FRA, 2008). However, the Employment Equality Directive has been imple-mented to varying degrees across the various member states.10. Soft law is a reference to quasi-legal instruments that do not involve legal obligation but which lay down principles. 11.

This trans-lates as progressing towards a model in which there is only one body that deals with all types of discrimination (Bell et al., 2007; FRA, 2009) – a model which has already been set up in 17 member states. However, this single body model for all kinds of discrimination has advantages and drawbacks. Note-worthy among the former are taking advantage of economies of scale, the need for a coherent interpretation by the legis-lative body regarding discrimination and the fact that there are frequent instances of multiple discrimination. Among the drawbacks, should be highlighted: the possible invisibility of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.Recognising the right to same-sex marriages is not homoge-nous across the EU member states, nor are the rights granted to these couples. While there are some countries which do not legally recognise same-sex partners, those which do have adopted different strategies: some member states recognise same-sex marriages18, while others simply have a registry for same-sex couples.19 These formulas for recognising couples, however, are not homogenous either: in some countries their rights are the same as those of married heterosexual couples, whilst in others they have fewer rights.Turning to adoption, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom20 allow same-sex cou-ples to adopt children together and legally. However, some counties recognise the right to adopt the biological child of the spouse and/or allow artificial insemination for lesbian couples.21 22As regards discrimination against transgender people, there is no EU country which specifies transgender people in their anti-discrimination legislation. Following the propos-als of some of the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights, 13 of the member states interpret discrimination against transgender people as a form of discrimination on the grounds of sex.23 In contrast, Germany and Spain have incorporated this as a form of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and Hungary has established that this is a specific form of discrimination on the grounds of gender identity. The remaining 11 EU countries do not specifically include this form of discrimination in their legislation.Regarding body modification, the European Convention on Human Rights requires all countries to permit sex reassign-ment surgery. At present, each country sets out its own re-quirements for access to this treatment. As pointed out in the report by the Fundamental Rights Agency (2008:127-9), in some states this decision depends on a judge or a team of medical professionals, which does not always guarantee access to body modification.As regards legal recognition of a new name and gender iden-tity, all EU countries should allow for this in official docu-ments. At present there are only four counties which do not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights, that is, states which do not allow citizens to change their name and sex. This is the case for Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and Latvia. The remaining member states legally rec-ognise the gender identity and new name of transgender people, each with their own and differing requirements. As illustrated in the «Transgender EuroStudy» published by IL-GA-Europe (Whittle et al., 2008), these requirements range 20. Finland and Germany.

The FRA (2009) report indicated that in some countries LGBT associations in recent years have come across difficul-ties (prohibitions, administrative obstacles) when attempting to organise demonstrations or hold meetings in support of LGBT people.24 These difficulties range from direct prohibi-tion to holding a protest march (with arguments of safety for those participating, or preserving public order and/or breach of public morality), to local administrations that are not pre-pared to cooperate with march organisers. In addition, coun-ter-demonstrations take place in some countries, commonly accompanied by a lack of protection for the demonstrators; public figures who lend support to the counter-demonstra-tions and the difficulties encountered by LGBT associations when trying to find a place for their headquarters, organise cultural events or voice their political claims.24. Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and Estonia. Attitudes towards LGBT people2.2This section provides an overview of the attitudes of European citizens towards homosexuality, based on data from Eurobarometer,25 the European Values Sur-vey26, and the European Social Survey.27 It gives an overview of some of the questions included in these surveys which are important to illustrate how values have evolved concerning homosexuality in European societies. It should be noted that these surveys do not include questions referring to trans-sexuality. First of all, the acceptance of homosexuality can be gauged from the results of the question in the Eurobarometer survey of 2006 whether homosexuality is still a taboo in their coun-try. 48% of the European population answered that homo-sexuality was still a taboo in their country, whilst 48% were of the opposite opinion. Figures vary across the European countries. The wide majority of the population in most of the Southern countries thought that homosexuality was still a taboo in their country (86% in Cyprus, 85% in Greece and 83% in Portugal, around 40 percentage points above the EU average). Countries far below the EU average are the Czech Republic (19%), Germany (28%) and Denmark (31%). Figure 1 shows the varying degrees of agreement when peo-ple were asked about whether gays and lesbians should live their own life as they wish (European Social Survey) and how this has evolved between 2002 and 2008. On the one hand, while the percentage of people who «strongly agree» in-creases over the years, the percentage for people who agree decreases, particularly after 2006. On the other hand, the figures for people who «disagree» or «strongly disagree» with this issue increase over the years. One explanation for this trend is that the number of countries included in the sample after 2006 increased with the inclusion of Cyprus, Latvia, Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia. As we have seen, these countries tend to show less LGBT-friendly attitudes, which may explain the overall decrease in the percentage of people who express tolerance towards gays and lesbians.25. The Eurobarometer comprises opinion polls and studies carried out by the Public Opinion Analysis sector of the European Commission. 26.

Citizens of Sweden (91%), the Netherlands (91%) and Den-mark (89%) are above the EU average, whilst Bulgarians (22%) and Latvians (25%) fall well short of the EU average. Data from the European Values Study show the evolution from 1990 to 2008 in the kind of people that citizens would not like to have as neighbours. In 1990, 43.1% of the re-spondents mentioned that they would not like to have a ho-mosexual as a neighbour. By 2008, this figure had fallen to 28.8%. Once again, we can see a wide variation between countries: the percentage of people who said they would not like to have a homosexual as a neighbour in Lithuania and Romania rises to 67.2% and 59.3%, respectively; however, the figures for Spain (5.4%), Denmark (5.7%) and France (5.7%) are well below the EU average. 45,040,035,030,025,020,015,010,05,00,05045403530252015105029,0Strongly agree        Agree        Neither agree nor disagree        Disagree        Strongly disagree29,2 28,8 29,838,935,33915,6 15,8 16,29,6 10,1 10,36,7 6,341,72002 2004 2006 200814,78,7 8,45,9Yes        No        Don’t know70%60%50%40%30%20%10%0%60%50%40%30%20%10%0%20082006 200935%5%60%34%5%61%38%4%58%1990 2000 2008Would not43,129,4 28,82008 200918%23%50%7%2%21%27%42%8%2%Uncomfortable        A little uncomfortable / fairly confortable        Comfortable        Indiferent        NS/NCHaving homosexual friends or acquaintances could be a vari-able which influences people’s views on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation (Eurobarometer, 2006) and at the same time shows how much gays and lesbians interre-late with the rest of the population and openly express their sexual orientation. In 2006, 35% of Europeans answered that they have lesbian and gay friends or acquaintances, a figure which rose 3 points by 2009 to give a European aver-age of 38%. Again, we need to take into account differences between European countries: in Bulgaria 7% have lesbian or gay friends; in the Czech Republic, 20%; in Estonia, 17%; in Slovakia, 15%— well below the European average. The highest figures for people with LGBT friends are recorded in the Netherlands (68%), followed by Sweden and France (both 59%).28Figure 4 shows how comfortable EU citizens are about hav-ing a homosexual in the highest elected political position in their country. These data show to what degree it is believed that gay or lesbian people are able to represent their coun-try, being of key symbolic importance. In 2008, 50% of the EU population would feel comfortable having a homosexual elected as a politician; in 2009, 42%. In this context, Euro-peans with LGBT friends or acquaintances are much more open to the idea of homosexuals holding a political office than Europeans who have no LGBT friends (Eurobarometer, 2009). Moreover, figures vary widely among EU countries, which, once again, probably explains the apparent shift over 28.

Source: Discrimination in the European Union, Eurobarometer: European Commission.Areas of intervention2.3This section provides an overview of the principal dif-ficulties encountered by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in different spheres of social life. It focuses on those areas where it is possible for local authori-ties to intervene, which means that issues related to recog-nising same sex partners or the right to asylum do not fall within the scope of this chapter.30 Chapters 3 and 4 contain examples of good practice and recommendations to resolve the difficulties set out here. 2.3.1. Local AdministrationLocal government is the level of government closest to the people, and where immediate action can be taken to solve problems experienced by LGBT people. Although municipal city councils are in a privileged position as they interact more closely with the population, it should be borne in mind that they do not have jurisdiction over all spheres, and so there are certain problematic issues where they cannot act or can only do so to a limited degree.In public administration, as in the rest of society, there are people who are unaware of the real situation experienced by the LGBT population, or who even hold homophobic or transphobic attitudes. Consequently, any kind of action should begin with training given to public employees aimed at sensitising public administration services more to the needs of LGBT people and providing them with better access to these services (see good practices 1, 24 and 26).LGBT associations can be an invaluable source of information prior to implementing measures to fight against discrimina-tion on the grounds of sexual or gender orientation. How-ever, sometimes LGBT associations cannot find channels to interact with those in municipal government, or else these channels are only sporadic.The challenge faced by administrations committed to fight-ing against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orienta-tion and gender identity, is to take the LGBT perspective into 30. However, some municipal councils have found ways to act in areas which fall outside their jurisdiction, as in the case of recognising same-sex partners (see chapter 3). 2. Context | 3736  | Combating Homophobiaaccount in the design, implementation and assessment of all municipal policies. This challenge needs to be seen in a context in which policies aimed at combating this kind of discrimination tend to be marginal concerns for local au-thorities, which means that these policies are susceptible to disappearing or being limited by budget cutbacks or changes in government / government policies. 2.3.2. Hate Crime and Hate Speech The first obstacle when tackling the theme of hate crime and hate speech directed at LGBT people, is the paucity of statisti-cal data compiled by EU Member States.31 This is compound-ed by the fact that the concept of hate crime and how it is re-corded vary from one country to another, therefore, what little data can be found in EU Member States are not comparable.There is a further difficulty when compiling data on hate crime: victims rarely report them. There may be several rea-sons why: to avoid the social stigma and prejudice which being LGBT entails; some people are victims of this type of attack so often that they do not bother to report them; the procedures for reporting are sometimes complicated; and some people do not trust the police because they have previ-ously experienced homophobic attacks by them (FRA, 2008). As a consequence of all these factors, there is hardly any public visibility of homophobic and transphobic crimes. However, the problem does not only stem from the victim’s reticence to report these attacks, but also from the fact that not all EU Member States include this type of attack in their penal codes as a crime. The penal code in twelve Member States32 classifies incitement to hatred, violence and discrimi-nation on the grounds of sexual orientation; but only nine of them consider homophobia to be an aggravating circum-stance in petty crime. In another thirteen States,33 legislation does not consider homophobia to be either an aggravating factor in petty crime, nor a crime in itself.34Due to the lack of data, there is limited information about the nature and geographic distribution of hate crime, which makes it difficult for legislators and policy makers to under-stand the global impact of this phenomenon and intervene 31. The FRA (2009) report did not uncover any available data for Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania or Spain. The OSCE (2008) adds the following countries to this list: Croatia, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 32. Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Spain, France, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and Northern Ireland.33. Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus and Malta.34. The case of Finland is unique, as it considers homophobia to be an aggravating factor in petty crime, but the penal code does not categorise incitement to hatred on grounds of sexual orientation.effectively to prevent these assaults. In spite of the paucity of available data, there are several coun-tries in which studies have been carried on this issue (see FRA, 2009). These studies outline the characteristics of hate crimes directed at LGBT people, with verbal attacks ranking high-est among the most important. They usually occur in public places with young people most frequently being the object of this type of attack. Lesbians and bisexual women are more likely to be assaulted in private places and to be the object of harassment or sexual threats. According to the OSCE (2006), a characteristic feature of the people who are the object of hate crime due to their sexual orientation or gender identity is that they cannot count on the support of their families, unlike victims of racial, religious or ethnic crimes. With regard to the profiles of the perpetrators of hate crime, studies have demonstrated that the majority are men who are not known to their victims. The motivations behind hom-ophobic/transphobic crimes are diverse, including the per-ceived violence felt by the aggressor when in the presence of gay, lesbian and/or transgender people alongside their desire to maintain the «social order» by means of assaults directed at people who fall outside of the dominant models of gender and sexuality (Butler, 2001). This explanation, called gender panic theory, traces the origin of transphobia/homophobia to the insecurity produced by the feeling of inadequacy with respect to the individual’s assigned gender. Seen from this perspective, homophobia/transphobia is the inevitable prod-uct of reproducing gender differences. This is especially vis-ible in the construction of masculinity which is based on the rejection of the gay man as an image of a discredited and effeminate man (Adam, 1998: 394).However, this explanation of the causes of transphobic/homo-phobic aggression has been used to exonerate the aggres-sor who, as a prisoner of his/her pathology, is not held fully responsible for his actions. Understanding the aggressor’s motivations does not mean exonerating him, rather it should serve to address the complexity of these kinds of assaults, plan more effective solutions and give more visibility to vio-lence caused by gender norms (Coll-Planas, 2010).2. Context | 3938  | Combating Homophobia2.3.3. FamilyFamilies, and especially parents, are role models and funda-mental sources of emotional support. For this reason, the recognition and acceptance of their sexual orientation and gender identity by family members is often very important for LGBT people, above all, for minors. Various studies carried out in EU Member States emphasise that many LGBT people conceal their sexual orientation from their families from fear of being rejected (FRA, 2009). The majority of the individuals who took part in Judit Takács’ study (2006) recounted negative experiences of rejection by their family members at the time of revealing their homo-sexuality or transsexuality. This rejection obliged young LGBT people to live a double life or resulted in self-denial. The concealment of sexual orientation or gender identity carries with it consequences such as lowering self esteem and also increases the likelihood of engaging in high risk behaviours, for example drug addiction or unsafe sex. Young people who are rejected by their families are at a greater risk of attempt-ing suicide, suffering from depression, taking drugs and con-tracting sexually transmitted diseases, than those gay and lesbian youth who have not suffered this kind of rejection (Ryan, 2009). The negative attitudes of, and rejection by, family members can also result in young LGBT people failing at school and be a handicap when planning their future or building emotional ties (Ryan, 2009). In contrast, acceptance and support from family members has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of young people, reducing the risk of depres-sion, and the tendency to take drugs or contemplate suicide. Furthermore, it is more likely that they will have a closer rela-tionship with their family of origin and want to form a family themselves. Certain factors have a positive bearing on the likelihood of family acceptance, such as reproducing a lifestyle similar to that of the supposed heterosexual norm (having a stable partner, for example), or behaviour in line with that socially attributed to their gender (i.e. to behave in a masculine way in the case of gay men, and feminine behaviour for lesbians). Nevertheless these factors only lead to partial acceptance because the family members continue to operate within a heteronormative schema, which means that their children can never fully satisfy their expectations. When parents discover that their son or daughter is homo-sexual, the most common reactions are: to exercise more control (particularly if they are minors); to be over-protective (from fear of social rejection); to cover it up (pressurising their children to keep it quiet); to look for someone to blame; to resign themselves to the fact; to send them to therapy; to feel disappointment; to think of it as a passing phase or even to throw them out of the family home (Takács, 2006; Coll-Planas, 2009). These adverse reactions are usually interpreted by LGBT people not just as a rejection of their sexual orien-tation, but also as a rejection of their whole being. How-ever, initial reactions are only the beginning of complex and variable processes of redefining family relations, with family members struggling to find new codes of communication and rules and roles which cannot be grounded in hetero-normative assumptions (Bertone and Franchi, 2008). What needs to be taken into account is the so-called ‹rain-bow perspective›, i.e. the perspective of those whose parents are gay or lesbian. This is becoming an increasingly wide-spread reality given improved access to assisted reproductive technology and adoption rights for same-sex couples in vari-ous EU countries. Going beyond the different legal contexts within the European Union (see section 2.1), LGBT families have to deal with a number of difficulties, namely: being re-jected by society because of inherent prejudices, to one de-gree or another, in all the EU countries; being invisible social-ly, in part due the prevailing heteronormativity in the mind of society as a whole; the constant subjection of same-sex families to comparisons with heterosexual families as regards their ability to bring up their children; and the problems for their children in school and in out-of-school environments.2.3.4. Education The position of LGBT people in education is possibly the area in which most research has been carried out in EU Mem-ber States. One of the most widespread conclusions is that schools are heteronormative institutions that muffle the 2. Context | 4140  | Combating Homophobiaexperiences of LGBT people and reproduce gender norms, a fact which forces LGBT students to conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity. Education is central to anti-discrimination policies regarding LGBT people for various reasons. Firstly, because there are LGBT people in classrooms who, because of their age and the hostile environment they find themselves in, are unable to accept their sexuality or gender identity. The FRA (2009) stresses that manifestations of homophobia represent a seri-ous problem in the education system in the 27 EU Member States. The most common victims of harassment35 are those students who do not conform to the social norms associated with their gender, that is, feminine boys and masculine girls. For students who have to endure this kind of harassment, the main consequences are absenteeism, dropping out of school early (less opportunities to access higher education and as a result, limited future social integration), poorer aca-demic performance, becoming isolated, a lower degree of personal well-being, lower self-esteem and a higher risk of attempting suicide (Takács, 2006; FRA, 2009). Secondly, education is central because it has a major influ-ence on shaping values and attitudes in society. An educa-tion that encourages respect for sexual and gender diversity will contribute towards building a more equitable society with less homophobic and transphobic violence. Further-more, it is important to take into account that it is during adolescence when people learn the social attitudes assigned to their sex and to distinguish what is appropriate from what is not in terms of the social norms relative to gender roles (Takács, 2006). Therefore, it is crucial to tackle sexual and gender diversity in the classroom openly and respectfully so that young people not only accept different sexual options and gender roles, but also feel free to express their own sexual orientation and gender identity. The school curriculum and the role of the teaching staff are crucial to this task. With respect to the school curriculum, various studies show how the reality of LGBT people remains invisible: sparse ref-erences to non-traditional families, non-heteronormative 35. Harassment includes insults, physical abuse, threats and bullying, understood in terms of a systematic abuse of power used to repeatedly and deliberately harm other people (Reid, Monsen and Rivers, 2004).relationships, and non-traditional gender roles and sexual orientation (FRA, 2009; Under Ytan, 2006; Alldred and Da-vid, 2007). Moreover, some of the references to LGBT people that can be found in the curriculum situate them in negative contexts such as considering homosexuality to be «an illness, a sin or unnatural» (Takács, 2006). When attempts are made to recognize LGB pupils, this can be limited to acknowledg-ing them because of their ‹special› needs or peculiarity rather than incorporating sexual orientation into the curriculum for everyone as a social justice issue (Alldred and David, 2007). The fact that this issue is invisible in schools has negative con-sequences for the sexual health of LGBT pupils, for their self-esteem, and increases their feeling of isolation (FRA, 2009). One of the principal issues related to teaching staff is their lack of training and tools to deal with questions related to the LGBT reality, which can be traced back to their academic and professional training. On the one hand, this makes teachers reluctant to tackle themes related to sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom, while on the other hand, it also makes it difficult for them to detect homophobic and transphobic attitudes and know how to act when they occur at school. When they do act, the measures taken can have limited success or even the opposite effect to that desired (Takács, 2006; Under Ytan, 2006; Coll-Planas; 2009). Furthermore, LGBT teachers encounter difficulties when they come out of the closet. This not only to the detriment of the teachers themselves, who are unable to be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity (Martinsson et al., 2007), but also for their LGBT students, who are left without positive role models and with the idea of non-heteronormativity as shameful and something which should be kept hidden.2.3.5. Employment Although it is illegal to directly discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity (see section 2.1), indirect discrimination continues to exist, disadvantaging LGBT people in what is a key area for achieving social inclu-sion (UGT, 2010; Martinsson et al., 2007). The Employment Equality Directive (2000/78/EC) prohibits 2. Context | 4342  | Combating Homophobiaboth direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the public and private sectors of the labour market, self-employment, access to careers advisory services, professional training, working conditions and mem-bership of and participation in trade unions.Nevertheless the LGBT workforce is confronted by various discriminatory situations, such as the need to conceal their sexual orientation from fear of losing their job (Takács, 2006). Quinn and Paradis (2007) point out that 42% of those sur-veyed who were LGBT had not revealed their sexual orienta-tion in their workplace. Harassment at work on the grounds of sexual orientation/gender identity usually consists of the repetitive expression of attitudes that «threaten the dignity of LGBT people, or that attempt to generate an intimidat-ing, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environ-ment» (UGT, 2010: 9). These attitudes create a situation in which access to work and job promotion become difficult or jeopardise the harassed person’s continuity in the workplace (UGT, 2010). Various research carried out in different European countries demonstrate that LGBT people experience direct or indirect discrimination and homophobia in the workplace that results in being treated unequally in aspects such as the recognition of work they have done, vacations and pay (FRA, 2009). As can be seen in section 2.4.1, transgender people encounter special difficulties with regard to workplace discrimination. The data available about discrimination towards LGBT people in the workplace mainly refer to how Europeans perceive dis-crimination on the grounds of sexual orientation at work. In the 2006 Eurobarometer survey, 32% of those surveyed «to-tally agreed» with the statement that it is difficult for LGBT people to reveal their sexual orientation in their workplace, and 45.5% stated that they «agreed».36 Answering the question «which factors pose a greater risk of redundancy for workers?», in 2008 20.9% of those surveyed for the Eurobarometer stated that sexual orientation (being gay or lesbian) puts one at a disadvantage. In 2009 this per-centage fell to 19.3%.37The level of agreement with the measures taken to promote 36. There are major differences among the countries: more than half of the population of Cyprus (67.8%), Greece (54%) and Romania (52.5%) totally agree with the statement that it is difficult for an LGBT person to reveal their sexual orientation in their workplace; while this percentage is much lower in Malta (20.3%), Spain (18%) and the UK (15.4%).37. Significant differences can be observed among countries: 35.7% of those surveyed in Cyprus, 33.9% in Sweden and 33.4% in Denmark stated that being gay or lesbian put workers at a disadvantage. In contrast, 11.4% of those surveyed in the Czech Republic and Ireland, 11.3% in Macedonia and 10.3% in the UK support this statement.equal opportunities, according to the Eurobarometer surveys (2008, 2009) demonstrates to what degree the population believes the state needs to intervene to combat inequality and discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. The majority of the European population surveyed were «somewhat in agreement» (34.6% in 2008 and 39.1% in 2009), followed by the population who «totally agreed» (34.1% in 2008 and 28.2% in 2009).38 As shown by a European study on policies in the workplace for lesbian and gay people (Colgan et al., 2007), despite legislation protecting their rights, heteronormativity in the workplace has not been reduced and there still remains a hierarchy between sexual identities that affect LGBT people being comfortable in the workplace (Gusmano, 2009).2.3.6. Health This section looks at the position of LGBT people in the healthcare system from two perspectives. Firstly, the issue of the discrimination experienced by gay, lesbian and transgen-der people in the health care system. Secondly, the specific needs of LGBT people in relation to health, including the question of sexually transmitted infections.Recent research (Gibbons et al., 2008; Coll-Planas and Missé, 2009; Pietrantoni et al., 2008) points out that LGBT people are faced with various challenges when accessing the health system. One of them is the lack of recognition of their same sex partner as next of kin or of their parenthood (for example, when making a decision about their partner’s or children’s treatment, or being able to visit them in their hospital room). Likewise, there is the issue of invisibility of LGBT people, as they may feel unsure about disclosing their sexual or gender identity to health professionals, who usually take it for granted that they are heterosexual and not transgender. More specifically, a large number of gynaecologists were found to be misinformed about the sexuality of lesbians or bisexual women. In the case of a transgender people, discriminatory treatment might include not addressing them by their preferred name and gender with which they self-identify. In the most extreme cases, some doctors recommend that their LGBT patients go for psychiatric therapy to «cure» 38. The countries in which the majority of the population who «totally agree» with taking these types of measures are: Cyprus (47.2%), Ireland (46.8%) and Northern Ireland (43.3%). Those with lower figures for «totally agree» are: Latvia (21.8%), Austria (21.2%) and Slovakia (21%).2. Context | 4544  | Combating Homophobiatheir homosexuality or transsexuality.39In relation to the health of LGBT people, Gibbons et al. (2008) point out that sexuality or gender identity in itself is not the cause of any emotional or mental problem per se. The mental health of these people is affected by the level of homophobia and transphobia they encounter around them. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2009: 67) states in its latest report of 2009 that, «sexual re-lations between men represents the predominant mode of transmission in North America and the European Union.» The report also underlines that within the population of men who have sex with men (MSM) there are some profiles which are more vulnerable than others. It confirms that there has been a sharp relaxation in the preventative behaviours of young people and that rates of infection in immigrant men are also very high. Both the WHO and UNAIDS have pointed out that conduct-ing regular tests on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) fa-cilitates the early detection of the virus and improves treat-ment outcomes. In relation to this question, there are people who recount having received stigmatising and guilt-inducing treatment when having tests in public centres (Coll-Planas and Missé, 2009). This discriminatory treatment plays a role in keeping potential users away from health centres. In contrast, some studies point out that it is important to in-vestigate the reasons why people engage in unsafe sex de-spite having access to information about its risks, since peo-ple who are well informed about preventing STIs continue to maintain high risk sexual behaviour (Fernández-Dávila, 2009).Finally, the majority of information campaigns are focused exclusively on HIV/Aids, leaving aside the multitude of other STIs for which there is very little information available about prevention and their impact, especially on lesbians, bisexual women and transgender people.2.3.7. Culture and MediaAs regards cultural representations, the real situation experi-enced by LGBT people has often been covered up, presented in terms of stereotypes or given a stigmatising treatment. 39. The World Health Organization (WHO) took homosexuality off their list of mental illnesses in 1990. Transsexuality continues to be classified as a gender identity disorder in both the WHO manual and that of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Nevertheless, both institutions reject the possibility of a cure for transsexuality. Given this situation, this sphere can serve as a basis from which to help break with this tradition of either biased rep-resentations or keeping silent on the matter. This can be achieved by recovering the historical memory of LGBT people (exhibitions, itineraries through the city, etc.), including pub-lications on the issue in libraries or promoting cultural expres-sion which fosters respect for sexual and gender diversity. The ways LGBT people are portrayed in the media deserve special attention as they have a major impact on society’s collective imagination and also on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people themselves. For example, the stereotypes of transsexuality or transgenderism published or broadcast by the media have a very negative and stigmatising impact on the construction of the identity of young transgender people and foment self-loathing and guilt (Espineira, 2008). At the same time, the powerful impact of the media on society can also be positive when used to change certain social prejudices, making sexual and gender diversity visible by means of experiences and plural stories that break with stereotypes. This is shown in the FRA report (2008) with examples taken from various countries such as Spain, Sweden and Denmark in which the greater visibility of LGBT people in the media has been accompanied by an increase in social acceptance.As with the other issues dealt with here, how the media rep-resents the lives LGBT people lead varies a good deal. Despite the fact that the approach taken by the media to this ques-tion is heterogeneous, it can be said that in the last few years, the realities of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people have gained visibility in the media within the EU. Neverthe-less, a majority of the media in Central and East European countries contain a high level of discriminatory attitudes to-wards LGBT people, even fomenting hatred towards them.40In the European countries where LGBT people are widely represented in the media there are other challenges to be overcome. Despite the fact that in many countries there are openly gay men and to a lesser extent, lesbians, presenting programmes or playing fictional characters in television se-ries, they are usually portrayed as stereotypes. 40. For more information, see the studies carried out in Lithuania (Tereskinas, 2007) and in Slovenia (Kuhar, 2003). 2. Context | 4746  | Combating HomophobiaTerminology used to refer to LGBT people is often inappro-priate (Stonewall, 2007). For example, it is common to refer to transgender people by their previous name and gender instead of by their chosen name and gender. The media are taking LGBT people into account more in order to be politi-cally correct but often the image they give of them and their issues is not sufficiently respectful.2.3.8. SportsSports, whether professional or amateur, is an area in which strict segregation by sex continues and, for this reason, it is a breeding ground for discrimination and attacks on LGBT people. Gender stereotypes reinforce the idea that some activities are appropriate for men and others for women (Wamsley, 2008). The greater physical strength attributed to men establishes sport as an eminently masculine activity, making it a key area where dominant masculine ideals are reproduced (Anderson, 2002). As a consequence, competi-tive sport, which enjoys the widest broadcasting and greatest resources, is male, while women’s sport is relegated to sec-ond place. This holds true with the exception of a few cases in which the sport is closely associated with femininity, such as for example synchronised swimming or ice-skating. An indicator of the high level of homophobia in the sporting world is the large number of homophobic insults used to deride opponents or referees in the context of sporting com-petitions. Clearly this environment does not encourage LGBT people to make themselves visible or publicly express their sexual orientation. In fact, there are still very few athletes and professional sportsmen and women who are openly gay or lesbian (Wamsley, 2008). This marked invisibility and stig-matisation reflects a situation that exists in both professional competition and local non-professional leagues.If gay and lesbian people play sports in a climate of fierce homophobia, then we can say that transgender and intersex people, in the majority of cases, are directly excluded from competitive sport. Professional competition is very strict in its segregation of the sexes. Since 1966 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has required female athletes to un-dergo femininity testing to confirm that they are «women» biologically speaking (Wamsley, 2008). To give an example, a transgender woman who wants to compete in a female league will have difficulties because she has higher levels of testosterone than other women, which can be considered an unfair advantage. This tendency to maintain strict segregation of the sexes in sport also extends to the majority of non-professional sporting competitions and results in excluding those people whose gender does not correspond to the body they live in. Therefore the integration of transgender people in sport is complex, and in the end, many give up playing sport when initiating their transition. And many never go near sport be-cause of the risk of revealing their bodies or because of the need to choose a gender category. In relation to obligatory school sport, young transgender people find that in many education centres sporting activities are segregated by sex and, furthermore, they are obliged to change in changing rooms of the gender attributed to them at birth, exposing them to the assaults and jokes that occur in these places made more so by the frequent absence of authority figures.There is an evident problem when it comes to LGBT role models in the world of sports who break with sexist and homophobic stereotypes. As a direct result of the factors listed above, there is a paucity of LGBT models in sport that could contribute to breaking with sexist, homophobic and transphobic stereotypes. Since the beginning of the 1990s there has been a move towards creating LGBT sports clubs and organising sporting championships on a global scale (such as the OutGames and the GayGames) and the European games, the EuroGames, which welcomed 5,000 athletes from more than 40 countries to the last event. These events have allowed many sports men and women to compete without having to remain silent about their sexual orientation and for some transgender people to participate in the gender in which they live.2.3.9. Religious institutionsThis section is dedicated to the issue of religion because in some EU countries, religious institutions and leaders occupy 2. Context | 4948  | Combating Homophobiaa prominent position in public debates on the rights of LGBT people. This is demonstrated in the FRA report (2009) that reflects how some discourses and religious organisations (mainly Orthodox and Catholic) have tried to pressurise their state governments to adopt positions against accepting cer-tain rights for LGBT people. This tendency continues to exist in Eastern European countries (for example Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania) and in the European South Mediterranean (Spain, Italy, and Greece, among others).Nevertheless, there are also religious organisations with a more progressive approach who have spoken out in defence of the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender peo-ple. This is the case of some Protestant churches, mostly situ-ated in Northern Europe (Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom), and of the Waldensian Church in Italy. In some cities in these countries religious organisations partici-pate in the LGBT movement, taking part in demonstrations held to celebrate the international day of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender people.Moving beyond the participation of religious leaders in the political debate about the rights of LGBT people, the contro-versy rages over what has been called «religious exemption» with respect to prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation at work. The Employment Equality Direc-tive (2000/78/EC) prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, but allows religious organisations a de-gree of exemption (Quinn and Paradise, 2007). Accordingly, these organisations can treat people differently if they do not correspond with the beliefs of the organisation. In several cases a person’s sexual orientation has been interpreted as not corresponding with the religious beliefs, thereby justify-ing discrimination towards LGBT people in those institutions controlled by religious organisations (health, social inclusion and education centres, etc.).Possible policy target groups2.4LGBT people do not only find themselves discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, but may also be positioned according to other classifications which are also sources of inequality, such as age, gender, social class or disability. This section deals with the issues that affect LGBT people who find themselves in a particularly vulnerable position, namely in reference to transgender and intersex people, the elderly, immigrants and people from ethnic minorities. There are other groups which can be considered vulnerable, such as minors and people living with HIV/Aids, who will not be included in this sec-tion because their issues have been dealt with previously in the sections on education and health, respectively. Although they are in particularly vulnerable social positions, specific information about LGBT people with physical or mental dis-abilities has not been included here as this study was unable to find cases of local authorities that have drawn up specific measures aimed at them.41 However, generally speaking, it can be stated that those LGBT people with a physical or men-tal disability often come across barriers to satisfying their ba-sic needs, often with a bearing on being able to make friends and/or establish partner relationships (see FRA, 2009).2.4.1. Transgender people Transgender people are in a particularly vulnerable position as they face high levels of discrimination, stigmatisation and violence. A central aspect that influences many associated issues is the consideration of transsexuality as a mental ill-ness (under the label of «gender identity disorder»).42 It is categorised as such in diagnostic manuals: DSM-IV-R, of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and the ICD-10, of the World Health Organisation (WHO).43This pathologising of identity has a number of practical con-sequences in their lives: it increases stigmatisation, regulates the procedures to change names or stated sex, controls ac-cess to medical treatment for body modification (hormone therapy and/or surgery) and is closely related to the fact that 41. For further information on LGBT people with disabilities see Berardi (2007).42. For a criticism of the pathologisation process see Missé and Coll-Planas (2010).43. The APA considered homosexuality a mental disorder until 1973 and the WHO until 1990 (Coll-Planas, 2009).2. Context | 5150  | Combating Homophobiathe main places where information about transsexuality can be obtained are medical centres. Furthermore, the fact that transsexuality is considered to be a mental disorder reinforc-es stigmatisation and reaffirms the image that transsexual people are inferior and do not belong to the realm of «nor-mality». This is the image that lies behind the assaults and discrimination. However, it should be pointed out that many transgender people feel that the existence of a label such as ‘gender identity disorder’ is a useful formula to ensure medi-cal cover for hormone therapy and/or surgical treatment.The majority of legislation passed by EU Member States concerning changing the official documents of transgender people has established that one of the requirements to le-gally obtain a change of name and stated sex is to present a certificate of gender identity disorder.44 In some cases there are also obligatory prerequisites such as undergoing body modification treatment, annulment of marriage or chemical sterilisation. The procedure for obtaining a mental disorder certificate can take months or even years, depending on the country. These prerequisites mean that many transgender people do not have documentation that corresponds to their image and their experience, an issue that causes them prob-lems in daily life, exposing them to discrimination, or compli-cating activities such as going to the library, the gym, paying by credit card, taking register at school or being called from the waiting room in a health centre.With regard to body modification, there is no uniformity in EU countries at present regarding medical cover for treatment for transgender people in the public health sector.45 The resulting obligatory nature and rigidity of the psychiatric procedure has a clear impact on the health of transgender people. To avoid going through psychiatric procedures many transgender peo-ple opt for self-medication with hormones or risky surgery. Furthermore, due to the influence of psychiatric discourse, the lack of public support and the fragility of their activism, transgender people find it difficult to obtain information and find meeting places outside the medical environment. Apart from medical and legal discrimination, the other ma-jor obstacle encountered by transgender people, mainly for women, is access to housing or the job market, either be-44. For a comparative table of European legislation in this area see Whittle et al. (2008: 24).45. For more information see Whittle et al. (2008). cause they are visibly transgender or because they have not changed their documentation. These are some of the reasons that drive a large number of transgender women into the sex trade. This poses two significant challenges: to facilitate ac-cess to the labour market for transgender women so they do not feel themselves obliged to do work that they do not wish to do and to improve the health and safety conditions for those transgender women who work in the sex trade.2.4.2. Intersex peopleWith regard to intersex people, the issues related to them need to be raised because of the marked invisibility that lies at the root of the social discrimination they suffer. Currently, the international protocols that regulate the procedures to follow on the birth of intersex people recommend hormone treatment and genital reconstruction. Despite the fact that in the case of some varieties of intersexuality the person may require medical treatment to survive, in the majority of the cases it is a question of hormone treatment and surgical pro-cedures that are not aimed at improving their health, but rather adapting their bodies to fit the male/female dichoto-my (Fausto-Sterling, 2000). One of the principal problems of intersex people is that they often do not discover that they were operated on at birth until many years later, because their parents did not tell them or even because their parents were not given adequate in-formation themselves. Moreover, some people do not even know they are intersex and discover this when they start to cope with health issues linked with their hormones (see for example Klinefelter syndrome).Since the 1990s, an intersex activism has emerged which has expressed a critical discourse about how intersexuality is seen and treated, making demands to stop surgical treatment on newborn babies (Chase, 2005). On the other hand, other intersex people are strongly in favour of intervention because they believe that the experience of living in a body that is not classifiable as male or female would be shameful and embar-rassing in a society in which gender is central to a person’s definition (Gregori, 2009).2. Context | 5352  | Combating HomophobiaAlthough in most cases the problems of intersex people are outside the jurisdiction of municipalities, it is important to talk about their situation when giving training sessions to local administration staff, particularly those aimed at health-care professionals. It is also essential to make efforts to pro-vide better information and visibility to the real situation ex-perienced by intersex people.2.4.3. Elderly LGBTIn recent years elderly LGBT people have begun to express their concerns when faced with the need to go back into the closet in their old age or when faced with the fear of being alone. They point out that the majority of places, facilities and programmes designed for the elderly adopt a heterosexist perspective. This means that the social workers or assistants in retirement homes and day centres frequently do not take into account the sexual or gender diversity of the people they care for. This, in addition to the fact that people of their gen-eration often have more intolerant attitudes, translates into making it very difficult for LGBT older people to express their feelings or gender identity, comfortably and without fear.Many elderly LGBT people will not have had children and may have broken the links with their families of origin because of homophobic/transphobic attitudes. This means that in the most extreme cases, some LGBT people find themselves in a situation of social isolation that increases their probability of dying alone and abandoned. These extreme situations accen-tuate the fear LGBT people have of aging alone (Coll-Planas and Missé, 2009). Older transgender people are in an especially vulnerable po-sition (Minter, 2002). In the case of transgender women, the majority received hormone therapy and underwent surgery at a time when these were not so carefully regulated, gener-ating numerous health problems. Furthermore, transgender women who work in the sex trade, often experience further social exclusion in their old age, given that they are the ob-ject of stigma and, in addition do not receive a pension be-cause sex work is not covered by regulations in the majority of European countries. This taken alongside the question of sexually transmitted infections, has meant that in some cases these women have a notably lower life expectancy than non-transgender women of their generation.In the case of transgender men, hormone therapy and surgery did not emerge until the 1980s, therefore at present there are few elderly transgender men. For this reason there is less in-formation about their problems and needs related to aging.2.4.3. Immigrant and ethnic minority LGBT peopleImmigrant and/or ethnic minority LGBT people (such as those among, for example, the Roma community) are especially vulnerable given that they are faced with a double bind. On the one hand, being a minority within a society that may hold xenophobic attitudes towards them and, on the other hand, living as LGBT people in their communities of origin. In European cities with high immigration flows, xenophobic and racist discourses have emerged within a section of LGBT people (FRA, 2009). They argue that immigration from coun-tries where there are less tolerant attitudes towards homo-sexuality and transsexuality should be limited because it might lead to a loss of rights of LGBT people (Carmona, 2006). Although not all immigrant communities or ethnic minori-ties are necessarily more homophobic or transphobic than the autochthonous population, it is true that a significant percentage of immigrants who arrive in Europe (or who mi-grate within the EU) come from countries in which homo-sexuality and transsexuality are less accepted or even actively repressed both socially and legally. In fact, many LGBT people emigrate to large cities in Western Europe because they can-not live in safe and free conditions in their countries of origin as openly LGBT people. Once in Europe, LGBT immigrants can experience strong con-flicts between links with their community of origin and the development or safe expression of their sexual orientation/gender identity. In the last few years organisations offering support and resources to LGBT immigrants have emerged in different European cities which attempt to facilitate the in-tegration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people whilst working towards conciliating relationships with their community of origin and culture.3. Recommendations | 55RecommendationsChapter 33. Recommendations | 57RecommendationsThis chapter sets out both recommendations for, and actual experiences of policies developed and imple-mented by European municipal councils to combat dis-crimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. These proposals are based on data compiled from original/new case studies, as well as from the literature avail-able from LGBT institutions and associations.Before addressing specific recommendations it is necessary to clarify that municipal responsibilities and powers differ in each country, and even within the same country, due to fac-tors such as the size of the municipality. For this reason, not all the recommendations presented here can be implement-ed in all municipalities. However, although they are specifi-cally focused at a municipal level, the recommendations out-lined here may also prove useful to suggest ideas for actions to be taken by administrations at other levels of government. There are town and city councils which look for ways of in-tervening in aspects that remain a priori outside their jurisdic-tion. These include finding creative ways of, for example, rec-ognising same sex partners despite lacking the authorisation to do so at a state level, or changing the names of transgen-der people who, for various reasons, have been unable to do so legally (see good practice 35). 3The Montpellier Appeal (France)Last November 14th 2009, the Mayor of Montpellier called for the legalisation of marriage between same sex partners in France, appealing to the French government to respect the rights of gay and lesbian people. Elected representatives and mayors, among others, the mayors of Paris, Toulouse and Lille, added their voices to this call. More information: http://www.lappeldemontpellier.fr/Same-sex Partnership Registers in Italian city councils (Italy)In some Italian city councils such as Bagheria (Palermo) and Pisa, some symbolic registers for same-sex partnerships have been created. In other cities such as Bologna, the Council has decided to approve the Register at the Registry Office for people bound by affective relationships and living together. This symbolic action allows for modifying the regulation of public council flat housing in order to allow gay and lesbian couples to access public selection. In July 2010, the Turin City Council approved an internal act named «Regulation for the recognition of the civil unions». This Regulation entitles the partners of civil unions (including same sex couples) to obtain, upon their request, the certification of «registry family bond by care relationships».

Recommendations | 5958  | Combating HomophobiaLocal administration3.1One of the main areas in which various campaigns can be implemented is within local administration itself. There are two fundamental ingredients to good local administration policy practices. Firstly, that policies are based on sound knowledge of the difficulties faced by LGBT people in the municipality and hence an accurate «diagnosis» of local problems and challenges (see good practice 2). It is important to take into account the heterogeneity that is hidden behind the initials LGBT and respond to the needs of those sectors that may find themselves particularly vulnerable (see section 2.4). Secondly, that local LGBT associations are involved in defin-ing and supporting both the diagnostic and the measures pro-posed and taken. It is also advisable to take advantage of the advice of experts or of other councils that have experience in the implementation of similar measures (see good practice 4).Following the inspiration of gender equality policies, which benefit from a longer tradition, it is clear that the ultimate objective of policies that deal with discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity must not be limited to a few concrete measures but rather should perme-ate general public policies. In other words, the aim for all government departments is to adopt a position that takes into account the impact of its policies on the realities experi-enced by LGBT people. The common ground for these policies is identified with the practice of mainstreaming, which is conceived as a way of networking between different levels of governance to com-pensate for the fragmentation of policies which one restricted to the context in which they are implemented. Following the definition of the Copenhagen Catalogue of Good Practices (The Danish Institute for Human Rights and World Outgames, 2009), the aim of mainstreaming is to ensure that LGBT people are protected against daily discrimination at the level of public policies so they can claim their rights and become active and participating citizens in all aspects of societal life. But, more important, its main focus lies in the incorporation of LGBT per-spectives in the development, improvement and evaluation of policies, new legislation, programmes and other activities. It is possible to identify two directions in mainstreaming:• internal: local administrations work at the horizontal level, involving all departments of city council and all asso-ciations that deal with LGBT issues. This mainstreaming ap-proach is well illustrated by the work of the piloting group of the Turin City Council (see good practice 7).• external: local administrations need to work at the verti-cal level in order to integrate different answers to public needs and ensure continuity over time. Factors which con-tribute to vertical relationships could be: demands by LGBT associations, research, mechanisms for participating, draw-ing national attention to LGBT topics that urges local ad-ministrations to take action in the same directions, drawing European attention to LGBT topics as a mean of legitimacy for any other level of local administration.This research has raised awareness of the range of alternative policies for promoting LGBT equality and the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. First, some adminis-trations have opted to set up a specific body to promote LGBT related policies (see good practices 5 and 8). The strengths of this model lie in the visibility it gives to the issue and its in-dependence to develop concrete measures. Nevertheless, its challenge lies in involving other areas of the administration in integrating an LGBT perspective. Furthermore, it is question-able whether the best way of tackling the various forms of discrimination is to create specialised bodies for each aspect (gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, disability, etc.), or whether each different form should be tackled simul-taneously via general and overarching laws and policies.Municipal Plan of the City of Berlin for the LGBT collective In February 2010 the Berlin City Council resolved that «Berlin stands up for self-determination and ac-ceptance of sexual diversity», aimed at drafting a Municipal Plan to continue to reduce homo- and trans-sexual–hostile attitudes and behaviour. Emphasising differentiated and target-group-orientated actions and drawn up with the assistance of NGOs a package of 23 measures was drafted in order to strengthen education and recognition, to combat discrimination, violence and prejudice-motivated crime, to bring forward governmental legislation and to advance dialogue to improve perception and to involve nation-wide legal equality on a basis of interdepartmental co-operation. The Programme is supported with an annual budget of 2,100,000 €. More information: www.Berlin.de/lads/gglw3. Recommendations | 6160  | Combating HomophobiaA second model does precisely this, by creating a single body that deals with all types of discrimination (on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity, etc.). One advantage of this model is that it fos-ters understanding of the similarities between different forms of discrimination and it favours working in overlapping areas. However, a joint approach carries the risk that the fight against homophobia and transphobia will remain invisible as other forms of discrimination may be considered more of a priority.Finally, a third model exists which is more hypothetical: that of combating homophobia and transphobia within the frame-work of gender equality policies (see good practice 3). If as-saults on LGBT people are considered to have their roots in the replication of differences and inequalities between men and women, an opportunity for a joint approach opens up in the areas of local administration dealing with these issues. This approach would permit recognition of what these forms of discrimination have in common and foster combining ef-forts. Nevertheless, this model comes up against the predomi-nant definition of gender politics (centred exclusively on the inequality between men and women) that is deeply rooted institutionally. More fruitful might be a broader concept of gender equality, for example ‘Gender Politics’, which would scrutinise assumptions about men and masculinity, as much as, and not only in opposition to, women and femininity. As regards the practices, among those possible within the lo-cal administration itself is the training of council employees as a first step in eradicating any homophobic and transphobic prejudices they may hold, thus promoting a more objective understanding of the real situation experienced by LGBT peo-ple. There are many ways of focusing on the priority areas to be tackled (frontline customer service employees, teaching staff, care professionals for the elderly, etc.). There are many examples of this in the good practices 1, 6, 24 and 26.Training workshop of the Vienna City Council (Austria)Every junior employee within the Viennese City Administration has to take part in a workshop about Anti-discrimination and LGBT issues. Approximately 220 people a year join the training courses; the city council organizes between 15 to 18 compulsory workshops a year, coordinated by the Department for Human Resources, about prejudices against LGBT and lesbian and gay workers, visibility in the City Administration workplace.

The training course concerning sexual orientation and gender identity is addressed to the municipal police force, front office and registry office employees. 3. Recommendations | 6362  | Combating HomophobiaActs of recognition3.2On a symbolic level, local administrations support for LGBT people, recognition of their contribution, and condemnation of the assaults and discrimination that they suffer, can be expressed by inviting LGBT associa-tion representatives to attend official acts and by ensuring an institutional presence at acts organised by LGBT associations.There are three important dates to be borne in mind: May 17th, International Day Against Homophobia and Transpho-bia; June 28th, International Day of Gay, Lesbian, Transgen-der and Bisexual people; and 20th November, Transgender Day of Remembrance (see good practices 10, 11, 12 and 30). Beyond providing symbolic support, there are many European town and city councils which actively collaborate with the organisations responsible for these kinds of celebra-tions in their cities.Organization of the international day against homophobia and transgender day of remem-brance in Turin (Italy)In Turin the International Day Against Homophobia (May, 17th) and the Transgender Day of Remem-brance (November, 20th) are celebrated through a shared programme of initiatives by the City Council, the Province, the Regional Authority and the GLBT Turin Pride Coordination (made up of local LGBT asso-ciations). Over the years, initiatives have developed to involve different City Council Departments (Youth Infopoints, Public Libraries and Local Districts) and other City Councils and associations at the regional level. More information: http://www.comune.torino.it/politichedigenere/lgbt; http://www.torinopride.it Support and funding of the Belgian Gay and Lesbian Parade in Brussels (Belgium)Brussels City Council collaborates with the network of associations in the city, organising the Gay and Lesbian Parade events aimed at promoting the visibility and rights of LGBTQI people. In addition to financing part of this initiative, the administration assumes the logistical coordination of both the parade and the street party. More information: www.bruxelles.beA way of providing support, whilst at the same time increasing the visibility of contributions by LGBT people to the social and cultural life of the city, is to include references to events and historic figures connected to the LGBT sphere in the nomenclature of the city: naming streets and squares, erecting monuments, and putting up plaques commemorating im-portant events, etc. The aim is to make the contribution of LGBT people visible in the municipality and, with time, to also commemorate or have acts of remembrance of assaults, persecution and discrimination suffered by them. Obviously, support for LGBT associations should not be lim-ited to the celebration of specific events and, in fact, there are many municipal councils which offer economic support to LGBT associations to enable them to develop and imple-ment their projects. Activism can be encouraged by means of distributing leaflets and promoting LGBT association activities in municipal facilities (cultural centres, libraries, sporting facili-ties, etc.).Another level of collaboration with LGBT associations is to recognise them as representatives whose opinion should be taken into account in areas that they are knowledgeable about. There are municipal councils that maintain contact with the representatives of such associations for specific mat-ters, while others support the creation of permanent par-ticipatory bodies, bringing together representatives from the Monument against homophobia in Sitges (Spain)On the 5th October 1996 various Catalan LGBT associations took to the streets in Sitges to demand the cessation of the persecution of gay and lesbian people by the local police. The demonstrators suffered threats from extreme right wing groups and rejection by some of the town’s citizens. Ten years later Sitges Town Council decided to commemorate the event by putting up a monument in the form of an inverted pink triangle on the third jetty of the beach in Sitges. The monument reads «Sitges against homophobia. Never Again. 5th October 1996-2006».Performance of LGBT interests by NGOs in Cologne (Germany)In Cologne LGBT interests are mainly handled by NGOs, financed and conceptually promoted at different government levels in order to support and strengthen involvement by citizens. This bottom-up approach is considered the best option because it allows those who are directly concerned to identify and express their interests and needs arising from real-life situations. The result of this, in the long-term, has been that LGBT community organisations have been founded by individuals in order to counteract discrimination and to show commitment to LGBT rights. A great deal of this work is done through voluntary participa-tion. More information: www.stadt-koeln.de.Symbolic marriage of a lesbian couple in Ljubljana (Slovenia)In 2004 the theme of the Ljubljana Pride Parade was same-sex marriage. During the Pride Parade, which took place in front of the city hall, a lesbian couple was symbolically married. The Mayor at the time, Danica Simsic (Mayor of Ljubljana 2003–2006), who could not officially perform the wedding ceremony (thus the Mayor’s role was performed by an actor), decided to give a present to the married lesbian couple. The «newly weds» were given two artistically designed glasses, a gift that is commonly given to heterosexual couples who get married in Ljubljana. The Mayor did this without any previous notice to the organizers of the Pride Parade – thus it came as an unexpected but beautiful, as well as both politically and symbolically very important, surprise.3. Recommendations | 6564  | Combating HomophobiaLGBT Map of the city of Paris (France) The city of Paris published the first free LGBT map of the city.

More information: www.skopik.fr.different perspectives in local activism with the objective of defining priorities and involving them in the design and evalu-ation of the policies implemented.Information3.3One way of increasing the visibility of LGBT people and providing useful information is to include relevant in-formation in customer service departments, on the council website, telephone help lines (see good practice 15), and in council publications. In several cities, the council has opted to open specific information centres aimed at LGBT people or resources centres on the LGBT collective (see good practice 32).The management and objectives of these information cen-tres vary depending on the city. For example, there are offices whose aim is not to provide general information, and instead have become specialised in dealing with people who have suffered discrimination as a result of being LGBT. In some cases, the office is an integral part of the local administration hierarchy, while in other cases LGBT associations run these kinds of offices with local administration backing (see good practice 14).Consulting and Information Centre «Cigale» (Luxembourg)Founded in 2002 on the basis of an agreement with the Ministry of Family Affairs and Integration in Luxembourg, «Cigale» (Centre d’Information Gay et Lesbien) is an advisory and information centre. Supported by a qualified educator, it offers a safe space for all age groups, for help prior to coming-out, for anyone who wants information and serves as a space for unobserved leisure activities. Primarily it concentrates on the issue of coming-out, leisure activities, providing advice and education in schools and youth centres, but has also expanded to cover anonymous online-consultations. To promote the efforts of LGBT citizens and in order to increase LGBT awareness especially, among young people, «Cigale» supports schools and teachers in including relevant aspects of homosexuality on various subjects in the curriculum. More information: www.info@cigale.luInformation centres in Lugo, Seville and Vitoria (Spain)The Spanish cities of Lugo, Seville and Vitoria have opened customer service and information centres for the LGBT population.

The office provides assistance to citizens who have directly experienced discrimination, in addition to psychological counselling, legal advice, conflict resolution and training. More information: www.bcn.cat/ondIn some cities, centres have been created that, in addition to providing services and information, serve as meeting places for LGBT associations (see good practice 13).Hate Crime and Hate Speech3.4Not all EU countries recognise crimes which are moti-vated by homophobia and transphobia in their penal codes (see section 2.1.2), but even so, local admin-istrations can and should combat hate speech and crimes against transgender, lesbian, gay and bisexual people. To combat anti-LGBT violence it is important to gain a better understanding of the motives and factors which lead indi-viduals to perpetrate these kinds of attacks. This is the reason why some local authorities collaborate with research projects aimed at a more in-depth understanding of the causes of violence towards LGBT people (see good practice 17).This research has come across a large number of experiences related to combating hate crime and hate speech in local administrations. It is possible to distinguish between those measures that can be implemented by the local administra-tion in general and those of specific concern to the local po-lice force. The local authorities can make official statements, cultivate campaigns or approve regulations that prohibit and sanction discrimination towards LGBT people in public places and in the city’s public services (see good practices 12 and 16).Police Officer training is a first step in achieving the integra-tion of the LGBT perspective in local police forces (see good practices 18 and 19). It is fundamental that these should not be one-off or optional training courses, but rather dealing with and preventing homophobia and transphobia should be an integral part of the standard compulsory training pro-grammes.Declaration of Manresa City Council (Spain)Last June 2009, the Manresa City Council session approved a motion that committed this Catalan lo-cality to uphold the rights of lesbian, gay, transsexual and bisexual people. Manresa declared itself to be «respectful towards sexual diversity» and «opposed to discrimination» on the grounds of «sexual orientation and/or identity». A rainbow flag was also unfurled on the facade of the Town Hall over the weekend of the June 26th to 28th.Training course on diversity and hate crimes for local police in the South of Sweden The need for the South Sweden police force to gain a better understanding of hate crimes and of the 3. Recommendations | 6968  | Combating Homophobiadiscrimination suffered by LGBT people was revealed as the result of a diagnostic process. With the aim of improving police response to these issues, the South Sweden police force, in collaboration with lo-cal LGBT associations with financing from the European Union organised a training course to increase awareness of discrimination towards LGBT people, diversity and hate crimes. Designing and testing innovative training models on LGBT issues for the Municipal Police Department of Turin City Council (Italy)Within the AHEAD project and in collaboration with local partners, the LGBT Office of the Turin City Council has designed and tested innovative professional training models (such as good practice 24). One of the model training courses, lasting fourteen hours, was addressed to the Municipal Police, particularly to police officers whose activities are performed in suburbs and in schools. Training was aimed at gaining understanding of sexual identity, recognising and understanding stereotypes and prejudices based on sexual orientation and gender identity, knowing how to prevent and how to act when faced with situ-ations of homophobic and transphobic discrimination. More information: http://www.comune.torino.it/politichedigenere/lgbtIn addition to encouraging a better approach towards those suffering discrimination and assaults of this kind, the train-ing should be aimed at eliminating any heterosexist attitudes and behaviour which may be expressed due to an assump-tion that all those present are heterosexual. A climate free of homophobia, transphobia and heterosexism in the local po-lice fosters a feeling of being a part of the police community by LGBT people and, consequently, creates the right condi-tions for male and female officers to come out of the closet.It is LGBT officers themselves, from different police units, who are ideally placed to take charge of operations related to homophobia and transphobia. In various EU countries such officers have formed specific associations that are able to offer advice to local police forces who wish to integrate LGBT perspectives into their work.It has been discovered that in several cities a considerable proportion of homophobic and transphobic assaults occur on the public transport system. If this is in fact the case, it is necessary to promote specific training for public trans-port staff and security guards (on metros, buses, trams, etc.) about discrimination towards LGBT people. One way of tackling homophobic and transphobic assaults and discrimination is to integrate them into the existing measures to combat hate related discrimination (for exam-ple, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, etc.).A common problem detected by many police forces is that hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation and gender iden-tity are not reported because the victims are not out about their situation and fear that they will not be dealt with re-spectfully by officers, or feel guilty due to their own internal-ised homophobia or transphobia. In order to improve the rate of reporting such crimes, specific materials can be created, aimed at LGBT people and contacts can be established with LGBT associations and meeting places. In parallel, communi-cation channels can be set up to facilitate third parties report-ing homophobic incidents. In fact, reporting schemes appear to be very successful in increasing hate-crime reporting.Another problem that has been detected is that homophobic and transphobic hate crimes are not recorded as such, result-ing in a scarcity of information about this type of crime. To address this, the local police could create systems to collate data on this type of assault and discrimination according to motive, the type of crime and the monitoring carried out. This data would provide information about which groups are more vulnerable and allow for developing policies that re-spond to these attacks based on more detailed and credible local information. With regard to the policing of cruising places, where men engage in frequently anonymous sexual encounters (parks, public toilets, etc.), the avoidance of police intervention is recommended provided no illegal activity is taking place. Nevertheless, it might be appropriate to conduct preventa-tive patroling, to prevent crimes such a thefts, that may occur in such places.3. Recommendations | 7170  | Combating HomophobiaFamily3.5In relation to the family sphere, there are three main ar-eas of intervention. First, it is possible to integrate LGBT considerations into family policies already being developed. This involves taking into account the needs and situations of families formed by LGBT progenitors, and providing support to those families in which conflicts arise due to one of their members (of any generation) coming out regarding their ho-mosexuality or transsexuality (see good practice 20).A second area of intervention is to promote a safe environ-ment and family support for LGBT minors by organising talks on this theme directed at parents, for example through school parents associations or municipality institutions.Family mediation through city council's activities in Naples (Italy)The Caivano City Council (Naples) has designed a project of Family mediation, including LGBT issues, aimed at reducing conflicts at the family level through meetings and free legal counselling in a specific city district. The Nola City Council (Naples) has planned a project in family responsibilities through ac-tions aimed at helping parents, reinforcing family competence, psychological support, legal and educa-tional counselling regarding LGBT issues as well.Living circumstances of «rainbow-families» in Cologne (Germany)This is a two-phase research project which measures aspects of the living circumstances of «rainbow families» in Cologne through quantitative and qualitative studies. The study has two basic objectives. The first part includes a socio-demographic assessment of LGBT-families: establishing the number and diversity of family constellations. The second part covers the living circumstances: documenting special challenges, positive experiences, critical situations and conflicts, family-demands, existing supplies (GOs and NGOs) and their demands, affiliation and commitment to self-organised networks. The study is to examine the family-friendliness of Cologne and point out the potential for developing «LGBT-family-friendliness».

One of the model training courses, lasting sixteen hours, was addressed to the personnel of the Centre for Relation-ships and Families, a reference for citizens and for Services dealing with family policies. Training is aimed at gaining an understanding of sexual orientation and gender identity issues, recognising analogies and differences of LGBT users in respect to heterosexual users, improving relational competences with LGBT users and their relatives, favouring collaboration and respect. More information: http://www.comune.torino.it/politichedigenere/lgbtFinally, the lived experiences of homosexual and transsexu-al parent families can be made more visible through public campaigns or activities such as story telling and other cultural forms directed at minors, that show the plurality of family forms. This will result in greater awareness of the increasingly diverse nature of contemporany family structures and, at the same time, favour a climate of respect towards the children of LGBT parents.Distributing the documentary «Homo baby boom», with a teaching guide, to all the schools in Gavà and Vilanova i la Geltrú (Spain)The town councils of Gavà and Vilanova i la Geltrú sent the documentary about same-sex parent families «Homo Baby Boom» to all the schools in their respective municipalities - produced by the Association of Lesbian and Gay Families of Catalonia. The documentary was accompanied by a teaching guide contain-ing activities to do in the classroom. The objective of this initiative was to increase the visibility of the social situation of lesbian mothers and gay fathers and also of their children by showing images of the day-to-day lives of these families.3. Recommendations | 7372  | Combating HomophobiaEducation3.6Education centres should be safe places for all students regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The main challenge, then, is to combat the systematic assaults LGBT people are subjected to and foster respect for sexual and gender diversity so that young people can con-struct their own sexuality and gender identity in a caring and respectful environment.Accomplishing this means that teaching staff and other pro-fessionals working in education need to be given training so that they can understand the real situation experienced by LGBT minors and have the means at their disposal to de-tect and take action against the assaults and discrimination these young people endure (see good practices 24 and 25). Aside from periodical training sessions, this subject should be systematically incorporated into their training and prac-tice, since respect for diversity and an environment free from homophobic and transphobic violence need to be under-stood as fundamental for all education centres.In order to foster effective action against bullying, proto-cols need to be established setting out steps that should be taken. When those in charge of education centres are faced with cases of assault, it is best to avoid simply resorting to a reprimand, and instead combine this with mediation ses-sions. Also, in the same vein, they should avoid singling out the problem by only dealing with the victims and aggressors, and instead see the incident as an opportunity to work on the issue of respect for sexual and gender diversity at a gen-eral level within the centre. Whatever the case, any kind of action taken in response to assaults of this kind needs to be handled with extreme delicacy, providing appropriate coun-Florence City Council (Italy): The city's keys - From Jupiter to Juno, from Barbie to Ken Training for teachers (6 hours) and students (8 hours) in high schools about gender stereotypes, diver-sity, discrimination, homophobic bullying, and equal opportunities.

More information: http://www.chiavidellacitta.it/index.php/progetti/formazione-alla-cittadinanza/70-cod-25-da-giove-e-giunone-a-barbie-e-ken selling and bearing in mind that the measures taken should not have negative repercussions for the victim.The active involvement of the entire education community is crucial to ending these kinds of assaults, because the feeling of being alone, and the humiliation and shame experienced by victims can prevent them from reporting these kinds of incidents, and besides, assaults often happen in places where authority figures are not present. Combating and eradicat-ing homophobia and transphobia can be incorporated into measures adopted to promote equality between women and men in these centres. These questions can also be raised in discussions and workshops given by LGBT associations or experts on this matter, targeting students, teachers and par-ents, perhaps separately (see good practice 23).Another line of action is to include issues in the school cur-riculum related to sexual orientation and gender identity, same-sex families, and to build positive representations of LGBT people (Tákacs, 2006: 34). In addition to covering this topic in sex education classes, it should also be incorporated into all subjects and also into cross-curricular themes and tar-gets for schools (see good practices 21 and 22).Conference «Bullying at School. Is it dangerous to be ‘different’? Sexual Orientation and Diver-sity in Schools» in Vienna City Council (Austria)A one-day conference held in Vienna in 2009 on difference-bullying in schools was attended by more than 220 participants from Austria, Italy, Germany and Hungary. Conference topics were the reduction of homophobia and heterosexism; awareness-raising on LGBT-issues for teachers and people working with juveniles; make schools a safe place also for LGBT-people and students who are ‘different’ due to any other diversity-category.

Recommendations | 7574  | Combating HomophobiaEmployment3.7The call for research projects which the AHEAD project ap-plied for, excluded employment related issues, as these were already being covered by other calls for projects, and consequently this has not been dealt with specifically here. However, as entry or inclusion in the job market is a central issue, some recommendations are put forward along with examples of good practice, which are aimed at combating homophobic and transphobic discrimination in the work place.One recommendation is to give training sessions on sexual and gender diversity to trade unions, companies and workers in the job placement services of the town/city council itself. These should be focusing on combating discrimination experienced by LGBT people, as this prevents them from being «out» about their sexual orientation, or gender identity, or directly excludes them from employment.As pointed out in the previous chapter, exclusion from the la-bour market is one of the main problems transgender people face. Bearing this in mind, an effective measure is to include them in the priority targets of pro-active employment policies carried out by the town/city council. At the same time, it is essential to develop strategies to promote vocational training for transgender people, above all, women, who find them-selves excluded from the labour market. Training can prove to be a particularly useful means for transgender women who work in the sex trade and who would like to have alter-native professional opportunities.Designing and testing innovative training models on LGBT issues addressed to the field of social inclusion (Job Centres of the Province of Turin) (Italy)Within the AHEAD project and in collaboration with local partners, the LGBT Office of the Turin City Coun-cil has designed and tested innovative professional training (such as good practice 24). One of the model training courses lasting sixteen hours, was addressed to Equal Opportunities representatives working in the Job Centres of the Province of Turin with a particular focus on job and social inclusion of LGBT people. Training was aimed at improving knowledge about sexual orientation and gender identity issues; getting more information on resources in the region in order to plan an efficient network; and identifying operating tools aimed at building an inclusive context. More information: http://www.comune.torino.it/politichedigenere/lgbtHealth3.8The jurisdiction of municipal councils in matters of healthcare can vary significantly from one municipality to another, depending on its size or the country, and so some of the recommendations set out here may not apply to all cases.The first step is to provide training for healthcare personnel, such as nurses and doctors etc., as they often either endorse LGBT stereotypes or are simply unaware of the situation experienced by LGBT people, which can have a detrimen-tal effect on the healthcare attention they receive. One of the objectives of these training sessions needs to be the is-sue of creating a climate in which LGBT people can feel safe and speak openly about their sexual orientation or gender identity, especially aspects related to their health. So, it is im-portant for healthcare professionals to come across as being open-minded and aware of the sexual or gender diversity of their patients which, among other considerations, means not automatically assuming that they are heterosexual (see good practice 26).In the case of transgender people, it is important to establish a specific protocol to ensure that their gender identity and chosen name will be respected, and that healthcare profes-sionals are familiar with the various medical alternatives for gender transition.Another approach is to introduce the LGBT perspective to spheres and bodies which work with sex education, contra-ception, family planning and sexuality, etc.Designing and implementing training courses on raising awareness about LGBT issues ad-dressed to public employees in family planning clinics in Turin (Italy)In 2008, in collaboration with the ASL (Local Health System) of Turin and National lesbian and gay group Arcigay, the LGBT Office of Turin City Council has developed a training course lasting fourteen hours on the topic of sexual orientation for personnel at family planning clinics, especially for personnel who carry out health and sex educational activities in schools. Training was aimed at providing adequate tools in or-der to preserve the bio-psycho-social health of non heterosexual people. In 2009 it developed a training focused on gender identity issues.

The aim was to offer a chance to update and reflect on topics related to gender identity and sexual orientation in childhood. More information: http://www.comune.torino.it/politichedigenere/lgbt Moving beyond national and regional plans to combat HIV/AIDS, discrimination against HIV-positive people can also be tackled at a municipal level by giving support and visibility to the council’s commitment to fight against the spread of the disease. This can take the form of public standpoints, campaigns, or symbolic events such as World AIDS Day on December 1st (see good practice 27). Countering discrimina-tion against people who are HIV-positive can begin with the town/city council itself by defining a specific support protocol for HIV positive workers.A debate rages at present about whether AIDS prevention campaigns should be directed specifically at men who have sex with men (MSM), or simply treated as a general issue, as there are those who hold that focusing attention on MSM can have a stigmatising effect. Some European cities, in addition to general campaigns, are in favour of prevention campaigns aimed at MSM given that the rates and ways of becoming infected differ significantly in this sector (see good practice 28). As regards sexually transmitted infections, it is also important to monitor epidemics to be able to control their impact and continue to back and promote research on the specific risks to the health of LGBT people.Religious Institutions3.9Certain steps can be taken at a municipal level which link religion with respect for sexual and gender diver-sity. For example, forums can be set up to discuss and reflect on the real situation experienced by LGBT people of various religious faiths. This is essential because of the in-fluence religious leaders have in transmitting values to their respective communities, and so that LGBT believers can feel accepted and not have to live with a contradiction between their religious beliefs and their sexuality/gender identity.Associations of LGBT believers can advise the local council and act as intermediaries to work on sexual and gender diversity with the religious communities.Inter-faith working group in Barcelona (Spain)This is an initiative coordinated by the Barcelona City Council’s Office for Religious Affairs and within the framework of its Municipal Plan for the LGBT collective. The aim of this initiative is to facilitate a forum for dialogue and reflection so that representatives (not necessarily official) from the various religious and spiritual traditions can explore challenges posed by integrating LGBT people into many religious communities and propose strategies based on their own religious resources and fundamental teachings from their traditions.

Recommendations | 7978  | Combating HomophobiaSports and Leisure Time3.10In the area of sports, transphobic and homophobic lan-guage needs to be approached from the perspective of fighting against sexism. To this end, the LGBT perspective can be included in the training of referees, team managers and sports technical staff. In the same way that a climate has been created which questions racist comments about sports figures, homophobic and transphobic insults can also be considered as behaviour subject to sanction.46 These cam-paigns should not only be focused on those directly involved in the sport (players, trainers, referees, etc.), but also sports fans in general.Another concern is the impact of values transmitted to the younger generation in their physical education classes at school. It is often the case that sexist logic prevails in these school activities, and homophobia and transphobia can be worked on from the perspective of the fight against inequal-ity and the differences between men and women. Promoting mixed sports is one way of giving visibility to such efforts.Given the lack of LGBT sports role models, support can be given to initiatives of LGBT associations and sport clubs to give more visibility to LGBT people in this area (see good practice 29). In addition to taking action at a strictly local level, a number of European cities have hosted LGBT sports events at a European level, such as the OutGames or the GayGames.As regards leisure time activities for young people outside schools, such as youth centres, scouts, etc., the gender and LGBT perspective can be incorporated into all types and stages of education. This does not mean associating gender issues exclusively with women or only targeting young LGBT on issues of sexual and gender diversity, but rather to rethink how the normative gender system affects everyone. Educa-tion in this area needs to be adapted to each age group and on the basis of their interests so that it is meaningful to their life.46. In the UK, the stewards at football matches are trained and expected to tackle homophobic comments and chants, but chose when not to challenge a majority chant, and the Football Association has not produced a specific campaign yet.Introduction of gender and LGBT mainstreaming in free-time education for children and youths in Barcelona (Spain)This was a pilot project carried out by the Barcelona City Council and the Escola Lliure El Sol. Materials on gender identity, stereotypes, preventing abusive relationships and transphobia were included in pro-grammes for instructors who work in youth organizations. The project was based on two specific aims: to design a four-hour training module that could be included in general training programmes given to instructors and designing teaching materials for teachers and students to be used in the training courses.3. Recommendations | 8180  | Combating HomophobiaThe Media and Culture3.11Municipal action in the media may be limited in small municipalities, although all councils have their own communication channels (news bulletins, maga-zines, web pages, or municipal radio stations/television chan-nels, etc.) and stage public campaigns. The council conveys a set of values, consciously or unconsciously, via all these chan-nels, and these can be used to give visibility to LGBT issues and respect for sexual and gender diversity.When dealing with LGBT topics it is advisable to seek ad-vice about appropriate and respectful terminology, as well as steering clear of stereotypes when making references to LGBT people. For some years now, various LGBT organisa-tions around the world have drawn up guides and codes for journalists about how to deal with LGBT issues, for example, GLAAD (2010), and ABGLT (2009).LGBT perspectives can be presented and promoted in cul-tural events, incorporating the real situation experienced by gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual people into program-ming events (specific events, exhibitions, historical itineraries, arts festivals, etc.).A number of events have taken place in recent years related to LGBT culture, particularly LGBT film festivals, which have often received council backing. Other cases of festivals are not just limited to films, but have also included other areas of the arts and offer opportunities for LGBT artists to make their work known (see good practice 31).Lesbian Herstory project in Budapest (Hungary) On behalf of the Budapest City Council the Social Public Foundation of Budapest (together with the EEA and Norway Grants) provided financial support for the Lesbian Herstory project of the Labrisz Lesbian Association in 2008. Within the supported Lesbian Herstory project a documentary entitled «Concealed Years» (90 min, director: Mária Takács) was produced in 2009, based on eleven Hungarian women’s ac-counts of the years of secrecy, about women, love, family, happiness, pain – before and after the political system change of 1989. The documentary was also screened at the Lesbian Film Festival, organised as part of «LIFT» Festival of Lesbian Identities in 2009. More information: www.labrisz.huOmovies, LGBT Film festival in Naples City Council (Italy) The LGBT Film festival is organised every year by local LGBT associations in collaboration with the Naples City Council in order to provide workshops, conferences and directly involve the participation of directors. The aim is to contribute, through cinema, to fighting against homophobia and develop meeting places free from discrimination and distrust towards differences. In the latest festival, there was a competition to select the best short against homophobic bullying produced by high schools. The event is free of charge so that young people can take part.

These are updated regularly on the advice of experts and are made public specifically to give visibility to the collection of books that are available. For more information: www.terrassa.cat/biblioteques; www.bcn.cat/bibliotequesActivities in collaboration with the public libraries of Turin City Council (Italy) The collaboration between the public libraries and the LGBT Office of Turin City Council started in 2002 with the aim of overcoming prejudices towards homosexuality and transsexuality that often influence cultural debate and social behaviour. Such collaboration includes: distributing information on LGBT as-sociations, editing bibliographies on LGBT issues, integrating archive heritage of public libraries on these issues, promoting initiatives on LGBT topics within the cultural planning of libraries. More information: http://www.comune.torino.it/cultura/biblioteche; http://www.comune.torino.it/politichedigenere/lgbtAs regards libraries, there are a number of simple strategies that can be adopted such as making basic reference books on LGBT issues available in municipal libraries, drawing up reading guides about homosexuality and transsexuality or introducing the topic into library events (reading clubs, story-telling for children…).3. Recommendations | 8382  | Combating HomophobiaTransgender people3.12Transgender people, especially women, in the majority of cases are particularly vulnerable to exclusion from the job market, above all if they are visibly transgender or have not been able to change their official documenta-tion. Faced with this situation, many transgender women work in the sex trade as their only employment option. To help integrate them into the job market, local authorities can include transgender people in their priority social group profiles as part of job placement policies, and apply posi-tive discrimination measures when hiring their own staff or as part of their criteria for hiring external services. Likewise, instruments can be developed to serve as guidelines both for local authorities as well as companies for effective inclu-sion of transgender persons into the workplace (see good practice 34).As regards the business world, it is essential to inform the opinions of trade union representatives and employers as well as to provide companies with incentives to hire transgender people. Hiring transgender people could be promoted from within the framework of corporate social responsibility.Concerning sex work, pro-active job placement measures should be established for transgender women who would like access to other types of work. In addition, there should be guarantees of safety and access to healthcare for women working in this area.ISELT desk for working and social inclusion of transsexual people in Turin City Council (Italy)The ISELT desk (Social and Working Inclusion of Transsexual people) was active in Turin from 2003 to 2007. The desk offered a counselling and welcome service aimed at aiding the inclusion of individuals socially and in the working environment. At the beginning of 2008, the rising number and variety of requests addressed to the ISELT desk prompted Turin City Council to close the ISELT desk and carry out training for staff working in the local Job Centres and in the Social Services in order to promote direct access to these services by transsexual and transgender people. Institutions and associations originally involved in the ISELT desk are still collaborating through the ISELT Coordination. More information: http://www.irma-torino.it/it/index.php/iseltAgreement to create services for transgender women looking for other job opportunities in Barcelona (Spain)The Barcelona City Council has backed an internal protocol in their drive to provide programmes for cus-tomer service, training and guidance for transgender people so they can enter the job market. In addition, it envisages signing an agreement with an association to provide professional training for transgender sex workers who want to leave this kind of work. For more information: www.bcn.cat/dretscivils In most EU countries to be able to change one’s sex and name in official documents requires undergoing medical and psychiatric treatment which can go on for years (see section 2.1.2). Although legislation governing changing one’s name and sex in official documents is outside municipal jurisdic-tion, local councils can allow transgender people to use their chosen name in certain documents (rather than the one re-corded on their official documentation). Examples of this are municipal databases in libraries, gymnasiums, primary and secondary schools etc. (see godd practice 35).Transgender people often find it particularly difficult to get legal and medical advice, information about sexual risk pre-vention, bibliographical sources, etc. This situation can be solved by setting up information points or giving support to transgender associations which can take on this role of into point or counselling, where transgender people provide counselling for other transgender people.Public buildings where users are segregated by sex (e.g. pub-lic gymnasium changing rooms) need to provide alternatives to prevent transgender people from feeling excluded from or vulnerable in these places. For example, one option, provid-ing there is mutual consent, is to allow them to use the areas designated for their chosen gender or make specific areas available, such as individual changing cubicles.In response to the feeling of exclusion experienced by transgender people in sports facilities in New Forest (UK), training sessions were given to sports coaches at the centre and the gymnasium and swimming pools were open for one day exclusively for transgender people.3. Recommendations | 8584  | Combating HomophobiaLGBT elderly3.13At present there is an on-going debate about whether to create spaces specially for LGBT elderly or wheth-er priority should be given to integrating them into those which already exist, and from there combat existing heterosexism, homophobia and transphobia. In fact, these two alternatives are not mutually exclusive but rather two courses of action which can be followed at the same time.Generally speaking, LGBT elderly collectively remain outside the groups targeted, either by public policies for the elderly or those policies focussed on LGBT people. This situation has come about because public policies for the elderly of-ten work from a heterosexist standpoint and because those aimed at fighting against discrimination of LGBT people of-ten do not take the elderly into consideration. So, the chal-lenge here is to incorporate the idea of sexual and gender diversity into local policies for the elderly and to introduce the ageing perspective in local policies aimed at combating discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gen-der identity.It is important to research these realities to gain greater knowledge of the specific needs of this social group, given that, on the one hand, in many European countries there is no visible generation of LGBT elderly, and on the other, the fact that this issue is dealt with very little from within the activism itself.In many cases LGBT elderly explain that they hide their sexual orientation and gender identity from professionals who take care of them out of fear of being rejected. Elderly transgen-der people, who in many cases cannot hide their gender identity, even stop going to the doctor’s or entering homes for the elderly for fear of rejection. To improve care for LGBT elderly, it is important for the professional staff working in day centres, retirement homes or providing home care, to be aware of this situation and to deal with these people in an atmosphere of respect and trust.Training for home care staff promoted by Barcelona City Council (Spain)Along with the Fundació Enllaç, The Barcelona City Council has drawn up teaching materials to inform about the real life situation of LGBT elderly, which is designed for personnel who provide home care for the elderly. The objective is to promote knowledge about, and respect for, sexual and gender diversity. This training module includes audiovisual support, and external companies who provide services for the council are required to use this module in programmes for their own staff. For more information: www.bcn.cat/dretscivils and www.fundacioenllac.catLGBT friendly elderly institutions in Nijmegen (The Netherlands)From 2008 Nijmegen City Council got involved in what is still an ongoing project targeting care homes and institutions for the elderly (other partners include ANBO, COC, Schorer and MOVISIE). These care homes and institutions can apply for the Roze Loper (app. = Pink Pass Key) an «official pink trademark» marking that the given institution pays attention to homosexuality in a sense that they are open and sensitive towards the concerns of LGBT elderly and their relatives. In order to obtain the Roze Loper qual-ity mark, institutions and care facilities explicitly need to demonstrate their LGBT sensitivity in the form of having staff with special training as well as LGBT-specific forms, procedures and codes of conduct. Positive outcomes mean a Pink Pass Key on an ornamental sign next to the entrance of the given institu-tion for everyone to see. By 2009 there were already six elderly care centres awarded with the Roze Loper prize by COC Nijmegen. More information: http://www.rozezorg.nl/info/5/achtergrondLGBT elderly often feel excluded both in centres for LGBT people as well as those for the elderly. Bearing this in mind, it is advisable to create safe, discrimination-free meeting spaces specifically for them. At the same time, it is important to incorporate the LGBT perspective into events organised in municipal premises which target the elderly (see good prac-tice 36).In an attempt to prevent the emergence of ghettoes for the elderly in general, and LGBT elderly in particular, it is a good idea to consider adopting a cross-generation perspective in which LGBT people of all ages can share experiences and explore shared histories and cultures.4747. In the UK, Gendered Intelligence, in collaboration with Age UK, have designed some interesting projects to bring together different LGBT generations through art events. Another example in the UK is organising events to create spaces that allow for sharing experiences and striking up friendships in an informal and relaxed atmosphere (see good practice 33).86  | Combating HomophobiaImmigration and Ethnic Minorities3.14Action taken in this area can be focused on fighting homophobia and transphobia in immigrant commu-nities and among particular ethnic minorities, and also against xenophobia by LGBT people.The LGBT perspective needs to be integrated throughout welcome centres and services to help integrate immigrants. This can take the form of speaking about respect for sexual and gender diversity in the materials used in welcoming ses-sions for immigrants which are given on a regular basis in many European municipalities.Promoting projects that work on respect for sexual and gender diversity in immigrant or ethnic minority communi-ties can prove particularly useful to promote changes in at-titudes. LGBT immigrant associations can play an active role in providing support for these efforts.The situation LGBT immigrants find themselves in can be particularly delicate, and so it is necessary to give training to professionals who work in the front line dealing with immigrants so that they can give advice and orientation re-garding LGBT associations, AIDS clinics, front line services for transgender people, etc.At the same time, it is important to develop measures to eradicate racist and xenophobic discourses by indigenous gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual people to fight against the stereotypes with which immigrants are burdened. This requires giving visibility to open debates on the experiences of LGBT people, immigrants and ethnic minorities.Living Library of Bologna City Council (Italy) Under the «Living Library» concept, individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds and representatives of any kind of minorities serve as human reference books, telling their personal stories to people that want to deconstruct stereotypes. The format is sponsored by the European Council as a counter measure to prejudice and gender stereotyping.Good practicesChapter 44. Good Practises | 89Training for Service Managers1 South Lanarkshire, United KingdomOverviewA training event for Council staff, including senior staff such as Service Managers and Directors, was run by South Lanarkshire Council in Scotland. The event aimed to raise awareness and understanding about the needs of LGBT service users, so as to improve employee attitudes and consequently service delivery to the public. The rationale was to provide staff with the opportunity to reflect on and discuss how well they currently meet these needs and how Council services for LGBT citizens could be improved, in an informal and supportive environment. The trainers also managed to create an informal and supportive space, which served to publicise and commemorate IDAHO. The significance of this action was probably its success in attracting the attendance of senior as well as more junior staff. The main drive behind the session was a desire to respond to requests to establish an employee forum via an employee survey. It was felt that this would be an appropriate way in which to raise awareness of issues affecting the LGBT community by addressing the misconceptions and myths that are sometimes portrayed in the media.Strengths •\t The\tsession\twas\tsuccessful\tand\tpositive\tand\thas\tled\tto\tthe\testablishment\tof\tthe\tCouncil’s\tLGBT\tForum.\tThis event will be run on an annual basis with the support of the Forum which gives added value to this initiative. •\t It\twas\twell\tattended\tby\tall\tlevels\tof\tstaff\tand\tthe\tpresence\tof\tHeads\tof\tService\tfrom\tdifferent\tDepartments\tof the Council was beneficial to the discussions that took place.

The event raised awareness among managers and staff of the needs of LGBT service users and provided an oppor-tunity for them to reflect on how well these needs are currently met and how their equality obligations could be better met.

Good Practises | 9190  | Combating HomophobiaWeaknesses•\t The difficulty of hosting training events for staff is that more senior staff tend to be less able to attend. Senior managers from each of the various local administration Departments could be encouraged to attend, alongside more managers generally, in order to provide a wider forum for sharing experiences and best practice.•\t The session could have been longer as many of those in attendance felt that discussions were sometimes cut short. A key aim of the session was to get people talking about the issues and so it is a mark of its success that participants wanted more time for discussion. Recommendations•\t Offer training for senior staff despite difficulties anticipated in securing their attendance.•\t Promote the practical value and efficacy of such an event to service managers to improve and develop their service in meeting the needs of LGBT communities.•\t Since senior manager buy-in is key to promoting positive attitudes at all levels, having a keynote speaker from the senior or Corporate Management team at such events may secure broader attendance and raise the profile of the event.Diagnostic LGTB Plan2OverviewIn October 2008, Barcelona City Council’s Department for Civil Rights began the process of drafting the Municipal Plan for LGBT people, aimed at coordinating and promoting action from different spheres of gov-ernment to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. This procedure comprised two phases: the diagnostic survey and the procedure for participation.The objectives of the diagnostic survey were as follows:•\t Map out the experiences of this social group taking into account the points of view of the LGBT popula-tion, associations, experts and the general public.•\t Prioritize the areas and groups in most urgent need.•\t Produce an inventory of the steps taken by Barcelona City Council in this area in recent years as well as identify municipal policies which could be developed further.Five studies were set up to respond to these objectives1:1. A diagnostic survey of the experiences of the LGBT population in Barcelona. The aim was to find out what problems are faced by different sectors of this population, highlighting the most vulnerable collec-tives and their proposals for solutions. The field work was based on 10 interviews with key informants, 11 interviews with LGBT representatives from different sectors, 4 focus groups and 454 responses from an on-line questionnaire. This questionnaire was posted on a blog (www.barcelonaensenten.wordpress.com) which was publicised via conventional and internet mailing lists and advertisements bearing the slogan «Barcelona ens entén?»2. During this process the blog received 3,191 hits.Thematic areas: Local Administration. Secondary areas: education, families, health, immigration, reli-gion, cooperation, hate crimes and hate speech, employment, sports, culture, elderly LGBT, and transgen-der people).Abstract: A two-phase procedure was carried out aimed at drafting a Municipal Plan that would en-compass the steps taken by different Barcelona City Council departments with regard to LGBT people. First a diagnostic survey was drafted based on five reports aimed at finding out how life is experienced by the LGBT population in Barcelona, the opinions of LGBT associations, how the general public view this social group, the measures being promoted in the various Barcelona City Council Departments and, finally, to identify good practices in other European municipalities. Second, a participative procedure was set up in order to involve municipal administrators, LGBT association representatives, experts and LGBT people on an individual basis in drafting the Plan.Key words: Local Plan, diagnostic survey, participation. Actors involved: City Council, LGTB associations, experts.Contact details: Barcelona City Council (Spain)Municipal Plan for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Communitydretscivils@bcn.cat www.bcn.cat/dretscivilsBarcelona, Spain1. The Institut de Govern i Polítiques Públiques (IGOP – Institute for Government and Public Policies), at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, took charge of supervising the methodology used throughout, as well as the first report itself and analysis of the second. The third and fifth reports were drawn up by ICC Consultors advisory service (the fifth with the collaboration of Jordi Petit). The fourth study was carried out by Espai Públic.4. Good Practises | 9392  | Combating Homophobia2. How the LGBT community is viewed by the general public. This took shape in the form of 10 questions on the subject, which were included in a poll carried out by Barcelona City Council on a quarterly basis to get public opinion feedback. The poll is conducted by means of a telephone survey of 1,000 informants.3. Contributions by LGBT associations in Barcelona. 24 interviews were carried out with LGBT association representatives and groups aimed at finding out the views of LGBT activists regarding the experience of this community, and the public policies that affect them.4. An inventory of Barcelona City Council public policies aimed at this social group. The purpose of this study was to obtain information about what different Barcelona City Council Departments do in relation to the LGBT collective and identify the areas which would benefit from further development. The field work was based on extensive documented research taken from interviews with ranking administrators from the various areas.5. Study of the experiences of other European municipal councils. Research into the measures adopted by other local governments was carried out using questionnaires which targeted LGBT associations in which the policies adopted by their municipal governments regarding LGBT collectives were evaluated. A total of 26 associations from 17 EU countries responded to this questionnaire.The results of the diagnostic survey were made public and the subject of discussion in two debate sessions. The first of these presented the fifth report and took place in June 2009. The second took place four months later in October 2009, in which the results of the other reports were presented and the go ahead was given for the participative process.Based on the results of the diagnostic survey, a participative procedure was set up with the objective of involving the various interested sectors in drafting the Municipal Plan. For the purposes of channelling participation, the issues detected in the diagnostic survey were grouped into seven thematic areas: minors, education and families; health and welfare; immigration, minority groups and international cooperation; homo/transphobia in public spaces and discrimination in the workplace; participa-tion, sports, financial support, and cultural events; elderly LGBT; and transgender. A file was created for each thematic area which included the main needs and proposals for dealing with any issues arising from them. These were used to structure the debate in each of the channels of participation.Three channels of participation were established3: 1. Seven thematic work groups which brought together administrators from Barcelona City Council, experts and representatives from LGBT associations. Their role was to discuss and draw up proposals based on the diagnostic documentation.2. Individuals had the opportunity to participate by responding to an on-line questionnaire which invited them to send proposals for steps to be taken in each of the thematic areas. The questionnaire was posted on the same blog used during the diagnostic phase. On this occasion there were 1,665 hits and 51 questionnaires completed.3. In March 2010, the (CMGLidhT) Municipal Board for Gays, Lesbians and Transsexuals held an open public Forum for participation. The Forum laid out proposals and provided an opportunity to discuss them.Parallel to the participative process, came the task of dialogue with the areas of government within Barce-lona City Council, namely, to reach an agreement over how to integrate the proposals which had emerged, into the Plan.After the CMGLidhT gave their approval to the Plan, it was then approved by the municipal government. The Plan includes a total of 228 measures which will be put into effect during the next five years, with a detailed 2. In Catalan and Spanish «entender» literally translates as «to understand», but its slang or sociolectal meaning among this collective is «to be gay or lesbian». A translation would be «Is Barcelona gay/lesbian friendly?»].3. IGOP took charge of coordinating the participative process and Espai Públic handled the dialogue with government departments and the drafting of the Plan.calendar setting out short, medium and long term priorities during this period. A monitoring committee will evaluate the implementation of these measures and will take decisions concerning possible changes and whatever modifications may be necessary to introduce during the period of time the Plan is in force.The plan was presented publically in October 2010 within the framework of the International Conference European Rainbow Cities, in turn within the framework of the AHEAD project.Strengths•\t A key factor when drawing up the Municipal Plan has been the willingness of the employees in the majority of the council’s administration departments to participate, their pro-active attitude and open-mindedness.•\t The city of Barcelona has a solid network of LGBT associations who were consulted for advice, taking full advantage of their expertise when drafting this document. The outcome is that this Municipal Plan is very closely linked to the interests of LGBT people as it is based, for the most part, on advice received from them.•\t Various experts and researchers were consulted when drawing up both the diagnostic survey on the experiences of LGBT people as well as the Municipal Plan.Weaknesses•\t The main challenge during this process has been to integrate the LGBT perspective into all Barcelona City Council departments. It was not just a matter of action being taken in areas specific to LGBT rights, such as social action in education, but also those areas which on the surface appear less directly involved in LGBT issues, such as the environment, employment or international cooperation.•\t Barcelona City Council has a history of collaboration with LGBT associations. However, there was scant involvement by some LGBT associations in this project due to a feeling that it would involve a great deal of effort in return for something which in the end would not be binding, or would not contribute real improvements in the lives of LGBT people in Barcelona.•\t The question of respect for human rights, and in particular the rights of LGBT people, still rank low in the priority policy agendas of local authorities. So, aside from drafting measures of this kind there has to be a political commitment to see them through, something which depends very much on each council department.Recommendations•\t When drawing up a Plan of this nature it is essential to work from an extensive diagnostic survey which ensures in-depth knowledge of the experiences of this collective and of their needs. Participation is also important, because it allows for the involvement of the various agents in drafting the Plan and conse-quently gives added value.•\t As regards the diagnostic procedure it is important to triangulate and to combine contributions derived from different research techniques (for example, questionnaires reach a wide number of people; inter-views allow for going into more detail regarding implications, etc.). In addition, the suitability of different research techniques varies according to the social group being researched.•\t Information technology can be particularly useful for gathering information for the diagnostic survey as well as proposals in a participative process. However, it is important to take into account the bias that this implies since not all social groups have the same degree of access to the internet or navigate it with the same ease.•\t The process must be founded on realistic expectations to avoid generating frustration. To this end, it is essential to be prepared to listen, take proposals into account and explain the reasons behind including or rejecting contributions. In order to avoid frustration it is also necessary to establish dialogue with all the departments concerning which proposals they are prepared to implement. It should be borne in mind that almost all of them are in a position to adopt measures to combat discrimination against LGBT people. It is also advisable to negotiate throughout the process with other political groups that will eventually have 4. Good Practises | 9594  | Combating Homophobiato vote on the Plan. Arriving at a consensus with such groups also guarantees that the Plan remains in force following a change of government.•\t It can prove productive to bring together municipal administrators, LGBT association representatives and experts for these debates. When choosing participants we urge a willingness to accept criticism, especially from representatives of LGBT associations, as they bring added valued to the debate. Likewise, one has to bear in mind that the participative process can result in a loss of trust by some associations, so it is important to show that a willingness to participate will translate into tangible results.•\t Direct involvement by those responsible for the Plan is a factor which lends credibility to the process, al-lows for dialogue and is an enriching experience for all parties involved.A rainbow of actions3OverviewIn Ghent, the Service of Diversity and Equal Opportunities has set a target for 2020 by which all citizens, regardless of their sex, age, faith, sexual orientation, functional diversity or socio-economic situation, will be able to grow up being treated equally in all aspects of social life. Within this context a policy note has been drawn up which is aimed specifically at LGBT people. The document points out a series of steps to be taken to increase the visibility of LGBT people and combat discrimination on the grounds of gender identity and/or sexual orientation. This initiative is a measure which sets out to be a «cornerstone for sustaining society» for the city through specific measures adopted by the local authority in the fight against homophobia.This policy note initiative, «A rainbow of actions», is based on three mainstays: equality between men and women, affirmative action and awareness of diversity at all local government levels and departments. It consists of 26 measures to be put into effect by the departments covering Family, Social Inclusion and Im-migration. These measures break down into five areas:1. Interacting both online and face-to-face with the Ghent LGBT community.2. Providing attention for LGBT people, above all those who are particularly vulnerable (the elderly, those of ethnic minority origin, those with functional diversity, women, young people and transgender people).3. Improving and promoting research into LGBT issues.4. Promoting a «gay-friendly» culture in the local administration.5. Applying LGBT issues to all areas of local authority social services (e.g. sports, tourism, health and welfare, communication, education and culture).This policy note is effective between 2008 and 2013, with a mid-term evaluation (2011-2012) and another at the end of this period.Strengths•\t The fact that Ghent City Council has decided to implement a specific plan of action for LGBT issues shows their willingness to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. •\t The report is based on studies and research into the experiences of LGBT people and conversations held with LGBT collectives in the area.Thematic areas: Participation, information, recognition.Abstract: The Policy note 'A rainbow of Actions' 2008-2013 is a policy document targeting LGBT people in Ghent, coordinated by the City Council’s Service of Diversity and Equal Opportunities.

A «Charter of Intentions» was drawn up to define the network’s aims, goals, proposals and requirements for member public administrations.RE.A.DY’s aims are to: •\t Identify, promote and share policies related to social inclusion for LGBT people.•\t Contribute to the dissemination of good practices to address LGBT issues in Italy.•\t Support regional and local Public Administration in carrying out activities aimed at recognising and pro-moting the rights of LGBT people.Regional Authorities, Provinces, City Councils and Equalities bodies can join the network by accepting the Charter of Intentions which requires the following commitment:•\t Establish contacts with local LGBT Associations.•\t Promote studies into LGBT people’s needs in order to take these into account in regional and local Public Administration planning.•\t Assist in disseminating good practices from across the country. For example, one of the first activities of the network was to share the experiences of other network partners.•\t Support the network by promoting the spread of information.•\t Participate in annual meetings.

To this end, RE.A.DY offers its partners tools for dealing with LGBT issues.•\t The decision to have a central coordination office that changes annually was a useful device to decentral-ise power and to make the network active everywhere in Italy.Weaknesses•\t Lack of necessary resources required to develop RE.A.DY to its full potential: funding, time and staffing.•\t Lack of exchange with national institutions and official political recognition due to the fact that, on one hand, RE.A.DY has been more focused on operational activities rather than political ones; on the other hand, national institutions tend to address citizens and associations directly rather than other Public Administration offices (in our case, local governments).•\t Lack of consistent relationships with LGBT associations at a national level due to the low visibility of the RE.A.DY network.•\t Need for political guidance to ensure that the network keeps to its agenda and to encourage other Public Administration offices to become involved.•\t Need to renew relationships with RE.A.DY partners after political changes following elections. Recommendations•\t The partners should meet regularly in order to evaluate activities carried out and establish future guide-lines.•\t The central coordination office should support and encourage all partners periodically by providing con-crete input.•\t RE.A.DY should ideally be run through a form of decentralised management. Every partner should under-take defined tasks in the network in order to support the central coordination office's role.•\t One of the ways to reinforce the national network is for each partner to promote RE.A.DY in its region through local networking (City Councils, Provinces, and Regional Authorities).•\t Network partners should not simply share experiences, but should try to create common strategies for activities with similar goals, in order to pass these strategies on at a national level. For example, if several partners have organised training courses aimed at combating homophobic bullying they could design common guidelines proposals for the Ministry of Education.•\t The network should share tools to create a kind of «toolbox», containing training models, publications, documentaries, exhibitions, etc., for the network partners and for all those Public Administration offices interested in becoming a partner of RE.A.DY.Round table discussions between local LGBT  associations and Naples City Council5OverviewIn October 2007, round table discussions were launched between local LGBT Associations and Naples City Council based in the Equal Opportunity Office of Naples City Council. Members of the round table discussions include four of the main local LGBT associations: I-Ken Onlus (www.i-ken.org), Arcigay Napoli (www.arcigaynapoli.org), Arcilesbica Napoli (www.arcilesbica.it/napoli) and A.T.N. (Transsexual Association Naples).In October 2008, a relevant and specific agreement protocol defining shared actions was approved. The aims of the round table discussions are:•\t To denounce the persistence of a culture of discrimination against LGBT people denoted by homophobia and transphobia, bullying, violence, misuse of power and hate.•\t To highlight the absence of efficient means to affirm full citizenship rights and dignity for LGBT people.•\t To raise awareness among the population of Naples to the value of difference, integration and solidarity.•\t To devise an integrated plan of action to combat homophobia, promote respect for difference and im-prove the living and working conditions of LGBT people.•\t To launch training programmes promoting a culture of respect towards difference for children of all school grades.Strengths•\t To begin collaboration between Naples City Council and LGBT associations grounded in the local context with the aim of understanding LGBT needs and prompting the city council to address these needs.Weaknesses•\t To find the time and the political will to collaborate regularly.•\t To maintain positive relationships between the LGBT associations involved.Thematic areas: Local administration.Abstract: The round table discussions between LGBT associations and Naples City Council aims to report on the persistence of a culture of discrimination to the detriment of LGBT people; highlighting the absence of efficient means to affirm the dignity of LGBT people; promoting an integrated plan of actions to combat homophobia; initiating a training programme aimed at promoting a culture of respect for differences.Key words: Network, participation.Actors involved: Naples City Council, LGBT associations: ATN (Transsexual Association Naples), Ar-cilesbica Naples, I-Ken Naples, Arcigay Naples).

This programme was approved and implemented at a session of Cologne City Council on June 22nd, 2006, followed by the consti-tutive meeting of the LGBT City Consortium on September 25th, 2006. The LGBT City Consortium comprises representatives of the administration, politicians and LGBT organisations and meets to deal with relevant issues arising in Cologne. They produce reports and recommendations for the administration of Cologne City Council and are currently working on a list of issues and aims in an attempt to further improve these recommendations.The executive board of the LGBT City Consortium is managed by the Department of Social Issues, Integration and the Environment.The LGBT City Consortium comprises:•\t One representative from each political party in the City Council.•\t One representative from eight different LGBT organisations in Cologne.•\t One member from each department of the local administration who are responsible for questions of diver-sity and discrimination: for example, the Department of Health, Social Issues, Schools and Gender Equality.The LGBT City Consortium compiles an annual report presenting information on its activities. Four annual meetings are held, to which guests and experts are invited to make contributions. Regular guests include a representative from Cologne’s police force and a representative from the Integration Council. In order to ensure that work continues between meetings, workshops are held for consortium members. The main top-ics addressed at the LGBT City Consortium meetings in 2010 were «rainbow families» and «homophobia». Previous topics have included: victim protection and the prevention of violence, equal treatment in the work environment, education in schools on LGBT issues, precautionary health protection, working with senior citizens, immigrants and sponsorship for sports and culture. In June 2007 the City Council decided to enshrine the LGBT City Consortium in the municipal law of the City Thematic areas: Local administration.Abstract: The City Consortium for Lesbian, Gay and Transgender people coordinates the interests of LGBT people in Cologne. Members of the LGBT City Consortium, comprising representatives from the administration, politicians and LGBT organisations, meet to address LGBT issues that arise in the com-munity. Proposals made by members of the LGBT community are considered and, if appropriate, incorpo-rated directly into administrative policies. Involvement in drafting municipal law and representation on different committees gives members of the LGBT community greater influence over political decisions.Key words: Participation, mainstreaming.Actors involved: City Council, LGBT organisations, experts.Beneficiaries: LGBT community in Cologne, Administration.Contact details: Cologne City Council (Germany)Geschäftsstelle der Stadt AG LST, Dezernat für Soziales, Integration und UmweltClaudia.Kutzer@stadt-koeln.de+49 – (0) 221 – 221 27467Cologne, Germany4. Good Practises | 103102  | Combating Homophobiaof Cologne and it has since been adopted as formal procedure. The inclusion of amendment § 23 b in the Main Charter, grants the LGBT City Consortium the power to delegate representatives to ten commissions within the City Council, facilitating the direct engagement of the LGBT community in the administration of different political areas.In January 2008 the Commission for Social Issues and the Elderly resolved to implement internal procedural rules drawn up by the LGBT City Consortium. Strengths •\t The LGBT City Consortium has managed to improve upon previously limited channels of communication between the administration, politicians and LGBT organisations. Networking between these organisations helps combat discrimination and the positive outcomes of collaboration have prompted new learning processes within the administration and a greater understanding of collective responsibility. •\t The shear number of topics dealt with by the LGBT City Consortium illustrates not only how important cooperation is at present, but also that it will continue to remain so in the future. •\t As a result of continued cooperation within the LGBT City Consortium, the members are better informed regarding the appropriate person to contact for each issue. Locating the right person was a key factor in solving many of the issues raised by the Consortium.•\t Projects developed by the LGBT City Consortium have been successfully implemented and proved work-able. As a consequence of this, at the beginning of 2010 the number of representatives on the consortium from LGBT organisations was extended from six to eight. Examples of the impact of the work of the City Consortium include:•\t Workshops held for administrative staff and politicians to raise awareness about LGBT issues, to sensitise them to the special needs of the LGBT community and look at ways of improving the living conditions of LGBT people.•\t The City Consortium provides support to those managing processes for ensuring diversity on a local level.•\t Current problems and concerns of gay/ lesbian restaurant owners were addressed during a special work-shop attended by representatives from the relevant City of Cologne Departments.•\t As a demonstration of support for Cologne’s Christopher Street Day Parade, its organisers and partici-pants, the City Council allocated 10,000€ from their 2009 Budget to invite representatives from selected twin cities to the event. Weaknesses•\t Ensuring that the interests of the LGBT NGOs are not overshadowed by the city administration.•\t Finding common ground.Recommendations•\t It is important to hold regular meetings as this allows for dialogue and enables the LGBT City Consortium to implement urgent actions more efficiently.•\t The active involvement of the municipal administration, representatives of LGBT organisations, politicians and experts is crucial to the success of the undertaking as it facilitates networking and professional ex-change between the different groups and actors. In this way the City Council and the administration are better able to respond competently and efficiently when solving problems and making decisions. Without the involvement of all actors miscommunication and misunderstandings can occur.•\t Incorporating the LGBT City Consortium into the administration was important, as it was then able to send representatives to different committees, draw up reports and make recommendations to Cologne City Council, thus facilitating greater involvement of members of the LGBT community in political decisions.LGBT Office and the Permanent Piloting Group7 Turin, ItalyOverviewIn February 2001, Turin City Council founded the LGBT Office with the aim of combating discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The LGBT Office arose from a proposal by the Turin Gay, Lesbian and Transsexual Coordination Board, which is comprised of local associations (currently GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board). The LGBT Office is part of the Department for Equal Opportunities, Gender and uses of Time Policies of the City of Turin.The LGBT Office aims to meet the needs of transsexual and homosexual people, to help them improve their quality of life, and to build a social climate of respect and prejudice-free relationships. To this end, a survey was carried out by the City Council to investigate the living conditions of LGBT people in Turin. Following this study, the LGBT Office:•\t Collected information about the specific needs of LGBT people.•\t Organised and co-ordinated social and cultural activities, as well as training sessions in collaboration with other municipal offices and local associations working in these areas.Over its ten years of existence, the LGBT Office has:•\t Made local Public Administration offices and citizens aware of LGBT issues.•\t Carried out cultural activities.•\t Trained School and Public Administration staff in order to promote access to public services by LGBT people and to raise civil servants’ awareness of issues relating to gender identity and sexual orientation.•\t Carried out educational activities to combat homophobia addressed to young people and schools.Thematic areas: Local administration.Abstract: Turin City Council has backed the proposal made by local LGBT associations to institute an LGBT Office to overcome discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The establishment of a Permanent Piloting Group comprising representatives from the various Departments of the City Council has been one of the most important tools used in achieving LGBT Service goals.Key words: Direct participation, mainstreaming.Actors involved: Turin City Council: LGBT Office, Permanent Piloting Group (Representatives of City Council Departments), Representatives in charge of LGBT issues working at Infopoint desks in the ten urban administrative Districts.Province of Turin: Equal Opportunities and Uses of Time Policies Sector.Piedmont Regional Authority: «Equal Opportunities for All» Unit.GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board and various LGBT Associations.ISELT Coordination Board (Coordination Board for the Social and Working Inclusion of Transsexual Peo-ple).Beneficiaries: Citizens, civil servants.Contact details: LGBT Office: E-mail: serviziolgbt@comune.torino.it  Telephone: +390114424040Website: http://www.comune.torino.it/politichedigenere/ 4. Good Practises | 105104  | Combating Homophobia•\t Promoted the inclusion of transgender and transsexual people in the social environment and in the work-place.•\t Co-operated with LGBT associations in encouraging and advertising their activities, in promoting training sessions and in developing joint initiatives.•\t Established a network with EU, national, regional and local Institutions.The following two boards were set up by the LGBT Office to carry out these actions:•\t The GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board.•\t The Permanent Piloting Group.The GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board brings together members from regional and local Public Administra-tion and the GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board. Meetings of this Board are held regularly to define and plan various initiatives. A Training Group within the GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board has been created to co-operate with the LGBT Office for training School and Public Administration staff.The second Board, the Permanent Piloting Group, is made up of representatives belonging to sixteen Depart-ments within the City Council, all members having been appropriately trained in LGBT issues. The establish-ment of the Permanent Piloting Group has encouraged the promotion of projects and initiatives relating to LGBT issues within the City Council offices.The Permanent Piloting Group meets twice a year in order to plan activities and evaluate results. The Group members meet annually for training to bring them up to date on LGBT issues. The LGBT Office frequently organises working meetings with the Group representatives to fine-tune specific projects. A reference subgroup has been set up within the Permanent Piloting Group. This subgroup is made up of representatives from the Infopoint desks located throughout the ten urban administrative districts of Turin City Council. Besides providing information on LGBT issues, these representatives act as a support network between the LGBT Office and the various bodies working in each urban district.Thanks to the Permanent Piloting Group, the LGBT Office has been able to train several City Council Depart-ments on LGBT issues. Training has been the starting point for introducing changes in professional attitudes and in working procedures, with the aim of making public services more accessible to LGBT people. A specific session on equalities, including LGBT issues, is currently part of the training course for new employees at Turin City Council and for volunteers enrolled in the National Civil Service.Starting from a letter of agreement signed between the City Council and the Province of Turin Equalities Councillors, the LGBT Office co-operates with the Equal Opportunities and Uses of Time Policies Sector of the Province of Turin, in order to extend actions to a provincial level. An example of this is the training course for teachers, which is also aimed at staff working in the various towns of the province of Turin. The LGBT Office also carries out specific projects in cooperation with the Piedmont Regional Authority office named «Equal Opportunities for All» Unit.In addition to this, the LGBT Office takes part, at a local level, in the ISELT Coordination Board (Coordination Board for the Social and Working Inclusion of Transsexual People) made up of various City Council Depart-ments as well as Associations and Consortiums. The goal of the ISELT Coordination Board is to develop initia-tives aimed at including transsexual and transgender people in the social environment and in the workplace. In 2006, Rome and Turin City Councils launched RE.A.DY (a public administration network that deals with anti-discrimination matters regarding sexual orientation and gender identity) to promote good practice throughout Italy (see good practice 4). The LGBT Office is currently in charge of the central coordination office for this network. Strengths •\t The existence of an Office that deals specifically with LGBT issues acknowledges and legitimises the rights of LGBT people. •\t The City Council LGBT Office serves as a reference point for all those who want to develop policies that foster social inclusion for LGBT people. •\t The existence of the LGBT Office in the City Council organisation should act as a guarantee that its ac-tions aimed at combating discrimination and promoting good practice will continue, notwithstanding any eventual political changes in the City Council.•\t The actions carried out by the Permanent Piloting Group encourage the dissemination of a culture based on respect for difference in terms of sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as accomplish impor-tant initiatives in the various City Council Departments. The Permanent Piloting Group has been pivotal in promoting specific training for administration staff as well as implementing projects.•\t The training of School and Public Administration personnel has resulted in a general change of attitude and the launch of specific actions to allow LGBT citizens to access public services in a non-threatening environment. The contribution made by the Training Group of the GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board has been fundamental, particularly with regard to those activities addressed to schools.•\t The partnership with the GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board has increased awareness of LGBT people’s needs and has led to further initiatives against homophobia.•\t LGBT issues have been included in the programme of cultural activities promoted by Turin City Council and addressed to all citizens (events, festivals, seminars, exhibitions etc.).•\t The networking approach set up and maintained by the LGBT Office both within the City Council and externally.•\t Participation in the AHEAD Project has permitted the LGBT Office to develop new training tools and to produce know-how that can be made available to all.Weaknesses•\t The lack of past experience for people working in the office entails the day-to-day reinforcement of profes-sional skills and the management of previously unexplored areas.•\t The shortage of resources within the City Council has resulted in budget cuts for the Equal Opportunities Department. The LGBT Office has attempted to redress this situation by developing inter-institutional co-operation with other Departments of the City Council and by targeting external funding opportunities.Recommendations•\t Guarantee the human and financial resources necessary for the management of an LGBT Office. It is important to stress that the personnel recruited to work in this office require training and constant updat-ing on LGBT issues.•\t Annual planning to establish clearly defined aims and objectives is necessary to ensure that the actions carried out by Administration Offices have the desired effect. Over the last two years, the LGBT Office has identified two general aims: to raise awareness among citizens and civil servants of LGBT issues, and to develop the LGBT Office and the national and local Networks. In addition it has identified three specific aims: to prevent homophobia and transphobia among children, teenagers and young people; to favour the inclusion of transsexual and transgender people in society and in the workplace; and to raise aware-ness among citizens and civil servants about issues concerning families and homosexuality. •\t Hold sessions to assess objectives and evaluate methods employed and results obtained from the various activities, with a particular emphasis on training.•\t Develop networking to prevent further fragmentation of the policies adopted by the different bodies and associations, taking action horizontally (other City Council Departments and associations) and vertically (Provincial or Regional Authority, the EU and national Institutions).4. Good Practises | 107106  | Combating HomophobiaSame-sex and Transgender Lifestyles  Anti-Discrimination Unit8 Vienna, AustriaOverviewThe Viennese Same-sex and Transgender Lifestyles Anti-Discrimination Unit to handle lesbian, gay and transgender people’s issues was set up in 1998 as part of the City Councillor’s Office for Integration, Women’s Issues, Consumer Protection and Personnel. The Unit employs two officials and one assistant.The Unit’s main mission is to make proposals to the City Government and City Administration about how to minimise the discrimination experienced by LGBT citizens in Vienna, taking into account the legal system. In Austria, the majority of laws relevant to LGBT rights are national laws and Federal Provinces, like Vienna, have limited powers when it comes to making laws.The following are some of the areas in which the Unit operates: 1. Counselling people who have to deal with discrimination due to their sexual identity or sexual orientation. One of the central themes of counselling is discrimination in the workplace. 2. Giving workshops and training on the legal and social situation of LGBT people for municipal employees, students, social workers, trainee nurses, City of Vienna Council trainees and various organisations that deal with equality and diversity. 3. Further raising political awareness. Discussions are held on special issues such as: anti-discrimination legislation, LGBT people and the workplace, the experience of LGBT elderly, lesbian and gay parents, lesbian immigrants etc.4. Organising an international conference on relevant LGBT concerns: civil partnership law, anti-discrimina-tion at work, bullying etc.5. Maintaining close contact with NGOs, municipal departments and other relevant organisations. This main-ly concerns providing information, support and cooperation on specific EU projects with the objective of putting an end to discrimination towards LGBT people. 6. Collaborating on the project «Schoolmates» within the Daphne programme, which included a question-naire for pupils, teachers and non-teaching staff in schools.7. One-off actions have included: Thematic areas: Local administration.

The Unit can act independently without the need for city administration approval and is backed by the powerful position of the Executive City Counsellor. •\t The unit develops and implements projects aimed both at employees of the city administration and all citizens of Vienna. •\t The two Anti-Discrimination Officer posts are held by a woman and a man with equal authority. Both of them have been active for many years within the LGBT community and consequently have earned a high degree of credibility. •\t The Unit has been running for more than 12 years and is very well known within the City of Vienna ad-ministration, the LGBT community and among NGOs.•\t In the field of counselling, the unit concentrates on discrimination in order not to interfere with the LGBT NGOs that provide counselling for those in the process of coming-out. Weaknesses•\t During its early days, the unit had to deal with distrust from the LGBT community, unconvinced that the city administration was capable of handling LGBT issues in a positive manner. •\t Sometimes it proves difficult for the Anti-Discrimination Officers to define their role within the bureau of an Executive City Council, as they belong both to the city administration and the LGBT community. Recommendations•\t Administrative support. The Executive City Councillor’s office can provide support for the work done by this Unit, since it was created within the hierarchy of the local administration.•\t Forge close links with colleagues. Cooperation with colleagues working in Women’s Affairs, Integration, Youth, Counselling, Training, etc. can be very helpful when designing training programmes and network-ing with other areas of local administration.•\t Ensure the equal representation of lesbian, gay and transgender personnel within the Unit. •\t Work towards improving cooperation between the Unit, the LGBT community and LGBT media. •\t Ensure people working in this Unit are given adequate supervision, as working within the structures of a city administration, in the field of sexual orientation and gender identity and being the link with the LGBT community at the same time, can be particularly challenging.4. Good Practises | 109108  | Combating HomophobiaDiversity Strategy – Charter of Diversity9OverviewIn 2007 the City of Cologne became the first Germany municipality to sign the «Charter of Diversity», which was signed by the Lord Mayor of Cologne and Deputy Mayor for Social Issues, Integration and the Environment. The concept of Diversity is still comparatively young. Originally developed in the US, it found its way to Europe at the end of the 90’s and was adopted in Germany by four multinational companies. Diversity Management is a holistic strategy aimed at promoting diversity in organisations and institutions to the benefit organisations and employees alike.The City of Cologne believes that its 16,869 employees should ideally mirror the make up of society and continuously refines its efforts to integrate all target groups.After signing the Charter, the administration set up an internal task force to develop a Diversity Strategy. This task force is made up of representatives from the Department of Human Resources, the Department of Social Issues, Integration and Environment, the Intercultural Council, the Commission for Disabled Persons’ Affairs, the Council for Lesbian, Gay and Transgender people, the Department of Social Issues and Senior Citizens and the Department for Gender Equality. A planning group was also set up to work on the Diversity Strategy, consisting of representatives from all target groups. Representatives were elected to the planning group by all the City Consortiums: the Integration Council, the City Consortium for Disabled Persons’ Affairs, the City Consortium for Senior Citizen Policy, the City Consortium for Lesbian, Gay and Transgender People and Cologne's Working Women's Association (AKF). This group ensures the involvement of all departments in decision making and informs politicians regularly about the outcomes of their meetings.The task force and planning group have developed measures to implement the Charter of Diversity. A report was compiled based on the findings of a workshop and several committee meetings, reflecting the current status of the activities of the different City Consortiums and Councils. The groups are responsible for working on the following:•\t Providing information about Diversity.•\t Implementing a diversity monitoring strategy, to analyse the effectiveness of activities aimed at encourag-ing Diversity Management.•\t Developing a strategy for internal and external Diversity Management.Thematic areas: Local administration, employment.Abstract: In 2007 Cologne City Council signed the Charter of Diversity and implemented a procedure to develop a Diversity Strategy for the municipal administration. The Charter, based on a document origi-nally developed for companies, sets out a basic commitment to equality and respect for diversity. The City of Cologne adapted the Strategy to meet the needs of a municipal administration. The City of Cologne promotes awareness among its employees about LGBT issues and champions the Charter of Diversity in other cities and within the business community.Key words: Coalition, mainstreaming, participation.Actors involved: Cologne City Council, LGBT organisations, experts.Beneficiaries: Administration, LGBT community in Cologne.Contact details: Cologne City Council (Germany)Department for Social Issues, Integration and the Environmentchristian.rahmfeld@stadt-koeln.de+49 – (0) 221 – 221 21087Cologne, Germany•\t Championing the adoption of the Charter of Diversity by other companies and cities.In addition to developing a municipal Diversity Strategy, the groups regularly exchange experiences and coor-dinate acts, namely, a talk given to the Integration Council by a representative of the LGBT City Consortium, and the involvement of the lesbian/ gay Foundation for Elderly People in making amendments to the City Consortium’s Senior Citizen Policy.In September 2008 the Department for Business Development, together with the Municipal Coalition for Work, launched an annual competition: «Diversity wins – a competition for companies in Cologne». All companies and organisations that value and support the diversity of their employees were invited to take part in the competition. In 2009 ten companies were given the «Diversity wins» award. The 2010 competi-tion opened with the speech: «Diversity as a factor of Economic Success» and invited Executive directors of companies and public institutions to learn more about diversity. Over 80 people took part. By means of this competition the City encouraged employers in Cologne to improve the job prospects of groups normally discriminated against in the labour market.The regular Diversity meetings achieved both local and national news coverage, providing further exposure for the project. A conference is planned for the beginning of 2011 with speakers who are experts in LGBT issues. As the last step in the completion of the Diversity Strategy, guidelines for all councils and departments will be produced and it will be implemented by the end of 2011.Strengths •\t Diversity Strategies analyse existing power structures, social exclusion and discrimination, outline the problems and facilitate approaches to overcoming them. The exchange of experiences has clarified the need for the Diversity Strategy to be more than the sum of the respective strategies of target groups involved in the process, as those belonging to more than one target group experience multiple discrimina-tion. •\t The creation of additional work groups to evaluate previously developed strategies is an important step in the process. Such work groups included: female immigrants, immigrants with disabilities, LGBT immigrants and senior immigrants.Weaknesses•\t Diversity Strategies were developed as company management tools, mainly to improve human resources management and to enable product and marketing departments to develop new customer approaches, therefore only certain aspects of the Diversity Strategy were appropriate in this context. A broader ap-proach is required for the Strategy to be implemented in the community with the inclusion of all minority groups. RecommendationsWhen developing a Diversity Strategy, it is important to:•\t Base it on an inclusive image of society, in which diversity is viewed as normality, and stereotypes are critically challenged.•\t Involve employees, citizens and politicians, as this is crucial to enhancing social solidarity.•\t Raise awareness among employees of the city council.•\t Integrate the interests of LGBT people into the mainstream and guarantee active implementation of the Diversity strategy.•\t Obtain guidelines from all of target groups, as unification would work against the Diversity approach and is not the desired outcome.4. Good Practises | 111110  | Combating HomophobiaRainbow flag in Ljubljana Castle10OverviewIn 2001, Ljubljana staged its first Pride parade. An enormous 50-metre long rainbow flag was smuggled into Ljubljana castle in a rucksack by a group of people who then hung it from the castle tower during the Pride Parade. Although it went unpunished by officials in Ljubljana, the act itself was illegal. However in 2005, Ljubljana municipal authorities officially permitted the hanging of a rainbow flag from the castle tower during the Pride parade. Symbolically and in terms of LGBT visibility this was a very important act as Ljubljana castle is a popular setting for civil ceremonies. Since 2005, a rainbow flag has been hung from the castle tower each year during Pride parades. This has been permitted by both mayors: Danica Simšic (2003 – 2006) and Zoran Jankovic (2007–). Furthermore, since 2001, all three mayors (including Vika Potocnik in 2002) have accepted the position of patron of honour of the Ljubljana Pride Parade.

(Out of the 21 European Mayors who joined the campaign there were only two from post-socialist coun-tries: Budapest and Ljubljana.)4 The aim of the campaign was to mobilise support from as many mayors of European cities as possible for the right of LGBT people to freedom of assembly and expression and to raise awareness among mayors of those European cities where LGBT people have had their constitutional right to freedom of assembly and expression restricted or denied, or who have faced aggressive and violent opposi-tion from radicals, nationalists and religious fundamentalists. In a public statement of July 9th 2007, entitled «Budapest Says No to Street Violence», after the LGBT Pride March of July 7th 2007 was violently attacked, the Mayor of Budapest, Dr. Gábor Demszky emphasised the following:«The peace of the Gay Pride March was disturbed by trouble-makers who are appearing more and more often on the streets of Budapest. Moreover, the perpetrators of these organised atrocities did not confine themselves to their usual devices. Physical violence and murderous threats were meted out against peace-ful marchers who were expressing their sexual identities. Not a single well-meaning democrat can remain silent about this! […] As mayor of Budapest it is my duty to stand up for all those who are persecuted in Budapest, whether for their belief, descent, or sexual orientation. Budapest says no to aggressive, extrem-ists who are more and more openly stoking up hatred directed at the most different groups of people. In this situation, if need be, I am also Jewish, Gypsy, and Gay. Budapest is our city. We will not allow that anyone should fear because they belong to a minority.»Thematic areas: Recognition, hate crime, hate speech.Abstract: The Mayor of Budapest (1990-2010), Dr. Gábor Demszky joined the campaign for freedom of assembly for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Europe launched by ILGA-Europe on April 24 2007. In 2007, he also made two public statements: the first one, entitled «More tolerance in Budapest!», expressed his full support of the LGBT Festival and Pride March (of July 5 2007), and another one, entitled «Budapest Says No to Street Violence» was published after the Pride March, during which participants of the LGBT Festival became the targets of openly violent attacks for the first time in the 12 year long peaceful history of Hungarian Pride Marches. In 2009 he published an open letter of support for the organisers of the 14th Budapest Pride March.Key words: Freedom of assembly, Pride marches, street violence.Actors involved: Mayor of Budapest, ILGA-Europe.Beneficiaries: Organizers and participants of the Budapest based Hungarian LGBT Festivals (2007, 2009), inhabitants of Budapest.Contact details: Name of the Institution: Budapest Mayor’s OfficeE-mail / telephone: - [Since October 2010 he is out of office – after 20 years of the liberal «Demszky-era» there is a new (conservative) Mayor of Budapest.]Website: www.budapest.hu Budapest, Hungary4.

In this statement it was af-firmed that, «Budapest is a free and tolerant city where all minority groups can openly come out.»On September 4th 2009, one day before the Budapest Pride March, the Mayor of Budapest published an open letter of support for the organisers of the 14th Budapest Pride March, in which he emphasised the following:«As the Mayor of Budapest I am glad that the city led by me follows the examples of such Western me-tropolis as Berlin, Madrid or Vienna, and NOT that of those cities where members of ethnic, religious or sexual minorities cannot be openly themselves with joy and dignity.»Strengths •\t High media and social visibility of the raised issues was guaranteed because of the mayor’s position. •\t In 2007, it was a very important gesture for the Mayor of Budapest to provide at least symbolic and emotional support to the LGBT crowd who had been attacked. Weaknesses•\t These acts were in no way institutional, they were more dependent on the individual traits and political preferences of the mayor than on his political position. However, they can serve as good examples for other public servants in positions of authority.Recommendations•\t Mayors should be able to speak the language and represent the interests of members of social minorities.Campaign «St John gets it»12OverviewIn order to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, between May 13th and 27th, 2010, the Sant Joan de Vilatorrada Town Council Department for Solidarity, Cooperation and Promotion of Peace ran various events to increase the visibility of the experiences of LGTB people in the town and to raise awareness among residents about issues related to homophobia and transphobia. The objectives of this ini-tiative, in addition to promoting respect and ending discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, were to promote the participation of citizens in the town and work on human rights at a local level. This involved implementing an initiative that bridged the different age groups, and the fields of culture and education.In total, this campaign covered five areas:•\t The Cal Gallifa public library was equipped with a collection of documents about affective diversity, with its own logo to identify it, comprising more than fifteen children’s books plus more than fifteen books for adults (literature, poetry, comics, essays, etc.) and a dozen audiovisual materials.•\t One of the story telling sessions was dedicated to telling stories about affective diversity for children between 5 and 12 years old at the Cal Gallifa library.•\t Classroom workshops for sixteen and seventeen year old students about the prevention of homophobia and transphobia were held at the Quercus School, attended by more than 150 adolescents.•\t A talk aimed at parents was held about how to support their LGBT children, organized by the school’s Parents Association.•\t A campaign profile «Sant Joan t’entén»5 (St John gets it) was created on the social networking site Facebook to foster participation, above all that of young people, by means of comments and documents uploaded onto the net. More than 300 people joined the campaign.Thematic areas: Recognition, culture, education, hate speech.Abstract: During the week of May 17th, on the International Day Against Homophobia and Transpho-bia, the Council for Solidarity, Cooperation and Promotion of Peace in Sant Joan de Vilatorrada organised various events aimed at raising awareness among the townspeople about the experiences of LGTB peo-ple and offering resources to this collective in a campaign called «Sant Joan t’entén» (St John gets it). Key words: Recognition, visibility.Actors involved: Town council, The Quercus School, the school parents association and the Cal Gallifa public library.

In Catalan and Spanish, the use of the verb «entender» in this slogan, is a way of saying that one is gay or lesbian in the slang of the collective.4. Good Practises | 115114  | Combating HomophobiaIn addition to the Facebook campaign, activities were advertised using posters, flyers, the council’s own website and the local press. A council employee from the Customer Service department was seconded to coordinate the project. Strengths •\t The principle strength of this campaign was the political commitment it achieved. On June 28th of the three previous years, the Town hall had hung a banner in favour of sexual freedom. Sant Joan is a pioneer in Spain in holding a symbolic act of this type. In 2010 the town wanted to take things a step further and dedicate a whole week to events focusing on the experiences of LGBT people, and to the defence of the rights of this group.•\t Another of this project’s strengths which should be stressed was the level of understanding and willing-ness of the different agents to cooperate, above all the Cal Gallifa library, the Quercus School and the parents association.•\t Another of the campaign’s strong points worth mentioning is that it did not consist solely of sporadic activities and that its effects will be long term. One example of this is the collection of documents about affective diversity acquired by the library. •\t Finally, to publicise the campaign group «Sant Joan t’entén»; it was promoted on the social networking site Facebook, to which more than 300 people joined. The group promoted participation in two ways. Firstly, the sharing of reflections, ideas, videos, music etc. related to the LGBT sphere with followers of the group. Secondly, to suggest proposals or changes to measures already implemented in this area. Weaknesses•\t The principle difficulty of the project lay in coordinating the workshops for young people in the school, as the campaign was met with some resistance by the teaching staff, who for reasons of timetabling did not feel it was appropriate to dedicate teaching hours to a workshop of this kind. In the face of this conflict, and with mediation by the teaching coordinator of the school, it proved possible to convince the teachers of the importance of this activity.•\t The campaign also came up against another obstacle: such topics are infrequently addressed by the local administration and may therefore be met with reluctance to address prejudices.Recommendations•\t The promoters of this campaign recommend that the programming of an initiative of this kind should not be undertaken alone. It is important to have the support and involvement of different bodies, both mu-nicipal and non-municipal. The more agents involved, the stronger the campaign will be, especially taking into account that it deals with an issue that even today generates prejudices.•\t Another recommendation is to clearly explain the aims of the campaign and to put a lot of effort into promoting it. In the case of this campaign, it proved highly positive that schools served as the channel and that it made use of new technologies to publicise the campaign and advertise its events through the group created in the social networking site Facebook.•\t It is also recommended that libraries include publications on LGTB related issues, to be aimed at all age groups, from infants to the elderly.CInForMATIonLGBT Centre13OverviewThe Paris LGBT Centre has been operating since it opened its main office to the public at the end of 1994. During 2005-2006 the Mayor of Paris decided to set aside an office block which they owned in the city centre for the LGBT Centre, comprising a ground floor (with windows giving on to the street), first floor and basement.After renovating the premises, some 250 m2, these were then rented out to the LGBT Centre through a joint venture entity linked to the City Council which deals with managing social spaces. The proposal to provide the LGBT Centre with a new central and considerably larger location was a local authority initiative, under-taken in accordance with the independence and decision making role of the LGBT Centre itself.The official opening took place in February 2008, right in the centre of Paris, close to the Marais neighbour-hood, where the majority of the city’s LGBT venues open to the public are located. During the two and a half years of its existence the number of visitors has tripled and it now houses a total of 72 associations.Strengths •\t First and foremost, as regards this initiative, is the significance of the fact that the local authority managed to relocate the LGBT Centre in the centre of the city. A key factor was completing a needs assessment for the Centre before the move: listening to the requests of LGBT representatives about the future Centre and adapting these as realistically as possible.•\t It proved particularly important to invite practically all the associations and both general and LGBT media to the official opening of the new office, thus highlighting that the LGBT Centre is a space open to every-one and a meeting point for the Paris LGBT community.Weaknesses•\t The biggest difficulties were the deadlines for bids to carry out the renovation and completing them within the prescribed time limit. The construction work was particularly important and took more than a year to complete. Recommendations•\t The main recommendation is to know how to choose the right location for a centre with these charac-teristics. The location is a key factor and for this reason it is important to find somewhere with windows, which is visible from the street and is central and accessible by public transport.Thematic areas: Information.Abstract: At the beginning of 2008, Paris City Council paved the way for relocating the LGBT Centre in a new public building in the centre of the city, by carrying out alterations to the building to house the Cen-tre, turning it into one of the city’s focal points for the LGBT community and its network of associations.Key words: Visibility, information, participation.Actors involved: Mayor’s Office, Direction des Affaires Sociales & de la Santé (DASES), a joint venture enterprise which manages and rents premises, LGBT associations.

It is a helpline that can be called from anywhere in Italy for support on LGBT issues. This service is for LGBT people and their friends and relatives who require counselling on health or psychological issues and on legal aspects of discrimination. This helpline has the backing of Rome City Council, the Regional gov-ernment of Lazio and the Province of Rome. It is managed by a network of associations with complementary expertise, since its philosophy is to create a network in which every association contributes their own specific know-how. The network is made up of: •\t Arcigay Roma, the provincial Arcigay committee, the largest LGBT association in Europe, which champions LGBT rights. It initiated the first phase of the Gay Help Line project and today is mainly responsible for training helpline operators.•\t ArciLesbica Roma (the provincial Arcilesbica committee) is the Italian association that champions the visibility of and support for lesbian women.

Good Practises | 121120  | Combating Homophobia‘No Place For Hate’ Campaign16 London, United KingdomOverviewThe Inner London Borough of Tower Hamlets prides itself on its work to combat hate crime. It works in partnership with local agencies including the police and community organisations, and takes an inte-grated approach to all forms of hate crime, including homophobic crime. This borough has a large ethnic minority population (particularly Muslim), a significant number of commercial gay venues but a high rate of crime as well as of hate crime. The decision to prioritise tackling homophobia was taken after a high profile incident created anxiety about further such crimes. As a result, hate crime against the LGBT community received more funding than other strands of hate crime, with the appointment of a part-time specialist LGBT Crime Worker within Victim Support (until budget cuts removed this funding in 2010).The strategic approach adopted has won awards for the Council and involves a multi-agency Forum (the Tower Hamlets No Place for Hate Forum - THNPFHF) that brings together key agencies to develop a co-ordinated response to hate crime. THNPFHF has three key aims: to protect and support victims, to deter perpetrators and to prevent hate crime through raising awareness and challenging prejudice and hate in all forms. These issues have been addressed as follows:•\t Protection and support for victims of hate crime: Training for council service staff to raise awareness of hate crime; mechanisms for recording and monitoring hate incidents, including the Third Party Reporting Project where a number of LGBT service providers have been trained to provide support for victims of homophobic abuse in order to encourage reporting; and improving and extending the advice and sup-port for victims, beyond helping with prosecution. As an example, to ensure effective support for victims of homophobic crime, THNPFHF commissioned a Victim Support Crime Worker who provided specialist support to victims of LGBT crime and same sex domestic violence. In order to improve understanding, the Equalities Team commissioned research into the needs of victims of homophobic hate crime which sought to build a local evidence base and improve service delivery.•\t Hold perpetrators accountable: A Hate Incidents Panel, co-chaired by the Police Community Safety Unit Thematic areas: Hate crime, education. Abstract: The award-winning campaign ‘No Place for Hate’ covers a wide area and attempts to elimi-nate hate crime in all its forms. The London Borough of Tower Hamlets has been ranked among the municipalities with the highest hate crime rate and has one of the largest ethnic minority communities in the United Kingdom. The Campaign has tackled issues such as public space values, awareness and commitment; focused on reporting of and responses to hate crime; trained council staff in order to raise awareness and expedite taking action; and has devised educational programmes including those spe-cifically targeting children and young people; and adopted a ‘zero tolerance for hate crime’ pledge. The Campaign aims to prevent hate crime through raising awareness, encouraging reporting and building cross-community cohesion, using a variety of methods to convey these messages.Key words: Hate crime, community safety, violence between same sex partners.Actors involved: LBTH Equalities team; The LGBT Forum, Community Safety Partnerships, Police, Edu-cation and Youth Services.Beneficiaries: LGBT community, Black and Minority Ethnic Community, Asylum Seekers and new im-migrant communities, the general population, the Council, the Police Service.Contact details: Menara Ahmed, Hate Crime Policy and Partnership Manager, Community Safety Policy and Partnership, London Borough of Tower Hamlets Menara.Ahmed@towerhamlets.gov.ukCHATE CrIME & HATE SPEECHand the Council, to review and coordinate action in critical cases; training and interventions especially targeting young people (the perpetrators of the earlier locally infamous abuse); and improving school responses to incidents of discrimination. •\t Prevention, awareness and community cohesion: A ‘No Place for Hate’ Campaign was run with posters in public places particularly around the homophobic hate crime ‘hot spot’; a Pledge of Zero Tolerance of hate crime was devised and endorsed by high-profile signatories; a mobile exhibition ‘Escape to Safety’ was organised for Refugee Week; advice and guidance to schools and other child and youth settings to develop robust anti-bullying policies and practices ensuring the recording of interviews with bullies as well as the taking of appropriate preventative actions; and designing and giving training sessions for council staff and producing a Hate Crime Manual that details guidance on responding to hate crime (download-able from www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/hatecrime).•\t In addition, educational programmes were devised which included: ‘Who Do We Think We Are Week’, which gives students an opportunity to discuss issues such as diversity, identity, citizenship and explore how these values apply to their school, the wider community, and across the country; and the ‘No Place for Hate’ Champions and ‘No Place for Hate’ Youth Champions, in which local people deliver hate crime awareness activities which include challenging prejudice and hate, working with all communities and condemning all forms of hate including homophobia.Strengths This novel and strategic response has the following strengths:•\t It avoids the sense of competition between forms of discrimination or between different marginalised social groups. •\t It has the power to influence resource decisions (e.g. the Hate Incidents Panel identifies areas that are risky and seeks to help target resources there e.g. policing). •\t It links with other agendas (e.g. ensures the issue of hate crime is added to the Older People’s Partnership Board, the Learning Disabilities Partnership Board and the Mental Health User Group).•\t It seeks cultural change through a wide range of educational awareness training programmes (e.g. No Place for Hate posters, ‘Who Do We Think We Are’ and ‘Escape to Safety’ packages etc.) and provides a lasting basis from which to take action.•\t Much of this project was resourced through pre-existing funds.Weaknesses•\t A risk of such a broad programme is that, in times of economic hardship, it looks like it can be cut without specific impact. That is, equalities work that goes under a general title (such as ‘anti-hate crime’) does not trigger the same equality safeguards (which are legally enshrined in the UK) as work that is explicitly sup-porting the LGBT, Black and minority ethnic or elderly community). Thus, not naming these communities makes the funding more vulnerable.•\t Similarly, a project that seeks to tackle all issues of hate crime at once could allow a particular strand of hate crime to be neglected. For instance, within the broad hate crimes package, anti-homophobia actions could be minimised or dropped by councils that do not share this commitment.Recommendations•\t Securing high level support within the council is essential to a campaign so ambitious in its breadth. •\t A clear unifying theme or name is helpful to have a wide-reaching impact in many different areas.•\t Multiple or regular press releases about the campaign to both the mainstream and the LGBT press is a key driver for the campaign as a whole, and it is important to keep these two audiences in focus.4. Good Practises | 123122  | Combating Homophobia«As Long As They Keep Away From Me»17OverviewThe Netherlands is known around the world for its liberal position on homosexuality. The capital city of Amsterdam in particular is often associated with gay emancipation, as it provided the setting for the world’s first legally recognized ‘gay marriage’ in 2001, and hosts famous annual gay parades. However, a growing number of the LGBT citizens of Amsterdam face verbal or physical violence and studies show that a feeling of insecurity has increased over the last 5 to 10 years among them. Attitudinal surveys show that the tolerance of the Dutch towards homosexuality is more than just an image: general tolerance of homosexual-ity increased dramatically between 1970 and 1980, and has since remained stable or even grown slightly as demonstrated by recent surveys. Several Dutch scholars have analyzed how the remarkable Dutch position regarding acceptance of homosexuality is used in the construction of national identity: ‘we’, the native, progressive Dutch versus ‘them’, the others who are backwards. The increasing popular support for the claim that acceptance of homosexuality is something ‘typically Dutch’ and thus should be protected, can indicate that the acceptance of homosexuality has become a touchstone of belonging to the Netherlands. With seemingly widespread support for gay rights among the Dutch population and broad political consen-sus on the issue, it is surprising that violence against homosexuals is a major problem in Amsterdam. For example, in 2007, 201 cases were recorded, of which 67 were cases of physical violence, and 38 of serious threat. In the view of populist right-wing politicians with strong anti-Islamic sentiments, violence against homosexuals is ‘almost always’ committed by (descendants of) Moroccan immigrants who fail to recognise ‘Dutch’ values of tolerance. However, the empirical fact is that not all perpetrators follow the same (Islamic) religious ideals, and it seems that the widely supported gay-friendly attitudes of the country cannot prevent incidences of anti-gay violence.Research, considered to be an example of good practice, was conducted by Laurens Buijs, Gert Hekma and Jan Willem Duyvendak, researchers at the Amsterdam Research Centre for Gender and Sexuality at the University of Amsterdam.Forty-five incidents of violence were reconstructed by means of in-depth interviews with 17 perpetrators (involved in 14 incidents), and analysis of extensive files from the Public Prosecutor and the Dutch Resettle-ment Association of 35 perpetrators (involved in 31 incidents). Perpetrators were asked about their motives Thematic areas: Hate crime, hate speech.Abstract: The «As Long As They Keep Away From Me» research project into perpetrators of homo-phobic and transphobic violence was conducted in 2007 and 2008 by researchers at the University of Amsterdam. The main goals of the research project included gaining a deeper insight into the motives and determining factors behind anti-LGBT violence, as well as drafting recommendations about how to make policy in order to tackle this form of violence. The research was commissioned by Amsterdam City Council, who gave great importance to determining the roots of the problem and devising a solution.Key words: Anti-LGBT violence.Actors involved: Researchers, research participants, Amsterdam City Council, Amsterdam Police.Beneficiaries: The LGBT and general population of Amsterdam and the Netherlands.Contact details: University of Amsterdam,Amsterdam Research Centre for Gender and Sexuality E-mail / telephone: buijs@uva.nl; +31 20 - 525 9111 Website: http://www.arcgs.uva.nl/arcgs/home.cfmAmsterdam, netherlandsand what drove them to commit violent acts against LGBT people. Focus group interviews with young men from ‘risk groups’ (i.e. with individuals who meet the profile of potential perpetrators, but who have probably not actually committed violent acts) were also conducted in order to determine the dominant discourse on homosexuality in different social groupings. Additional surveys conducted in secondary schools offered the perspective of Amsterdam youth in general.One of the major findings was the heteronormative attitudes towards homosexuality (especially concerning four aspects: anal sex, feminine behaviour, public displays, and seduction attempts) found in all research groups (i.e. secondary school pupils, individuals belonging to violent risk groups and perpetrators), seemed to provide fertile ground for anti-gay violence. Strengths •\t Empirical research findings can provide a sound base for practical policies. More systemic research would be necessary to uncover what motivates the perpetrators of anti-LGBT violence. Weaknesses•\t Not all cities are willing, or have the means, to conduct such research projects.Recommendations•\t Research findings should be used in drafting policies to combat anti-LGBT violence.4. Good Practises | 125124  | Combating HomophobiaPermanent Contact Person within the Police  Department for LGBT people18OverviewIn the early 1990's an increasing number of cases of violent assaults on LGBT people required an im-provement in relations between the police authorities and the LGBT community. Set against the historical background of National Socialism and the existence of aggressive anti- homosexuality legislation up to the 1990s, a fundamental lack of confidence between police and LGBT community has developed. As a conse-quence, victims have felt unable to report criminal acts against LGBT people and instead of turning to state run institutions the LGBT community has set up self-help-groups. Police studies into prejudice-motivated attacks have verified this lack of trust, as fewer verbal attacks, complaints and criminal assaults against LGBT collectives have been registered at police stations than have been reported to victim counselling centres. Today police statistics continue to record only information given voluntarily by victims and no information on aggressor motivation is included in assault reports. In 1994 all legal distinctions between heterosexual and homosexual sexual acts were abolished bringing an end to prosecutions on the grounds of homosexuality. In response to these changes in the law the Berlin Police Department started to study the experience of being LGBT, especially with regards to personal safety. Measures were developed to improve mutual trust between the police authorities and the LGBT commu-nity. Furthermore, it was acknowledged that greater acceptance of LGBT people within the police staff was required.As a first step in this process, the experiences of other European countries, such as the Netherlands, were evaluated in order to analyse the situation elsewhere and to explore possibilities for improvement. Next, working groups were set up and expert symposia and forums were held with representatives from all target groups.The main objective of Berlin’s Chief Constable was to focus on the experiences of LGBT people. In recognition of the importance of this issue, a male contact person for LGBT people was appointed in 1992 and this was followed in 2006 by the appointment of a female contact person. The LGBT contact person provides support in the following areas:•\t Evaluation of criminal act reports, studies and publications on this topic.Thematic areas: Confidence building measures, participation.Abstract: The City of Berlin introduced new measures to promote respect for the LGBT community and improve their living conditions. One of these measures involved the appointment of a permanent contact person for the LGBT community within the Berlin Police Department, with the aim of developing trust between the police authorities and the LGBT community, clarifying what constitutes a criminal case and helping prevent criminal attacks.Key words: Participation, mainstreaming, police authorities.Actors involved: Berlin City Council, Berlin Police Department, LGBT organisations, experts.Beneficiaries: Administration, police and LGBT communities in Berlin.Contact details: Berlin Police Department (Germany)Central Office for Prevention Contact person for LGBT people Chief Inspector Uwe Löher, Inspector Maria Tischbier +49 (0) 30 4664 979444Berlin, Germany•\t Development of strategies for the prevention and prosecution of crime.•\t Training and advanced education of police officers related to victim protection and phenomenology.•\t Support for police investigations.•\t Attend LGBT community events.•\t Consulting service for affected persons, cooperation and support for projects and LGBT community cam-paigns. •\t Victim support and assistance. •\t Advice and support for LGBT people who wish to file a complaint against the police authorities.•\t Design and distribution of flyers for victims of violence and robbery; consulting services/ public relations.•\t Giving talks at events on the subject of aggression, violence and negotiation.Although evaluating the success of preventative measures is difficult, there has been a significant improve-ment in the level of involvement of the LGBT community in internal police procedures. Procedures to record and identify criminal acts against LGBT people have also been refined.The finding that theft is the most common crime suffered by LGBT people has resulted in reinforced efforts to provide police presence in neighbourhoods with a high index of LGBT residents and «cruising areas». Safety campaigns directed at LGBT people were also launched in these places. Strengths •\t Methods easily transferable to other governmental infrastructures.•\t The exchange of experience is a motivating factor in collaborative working.•\t Involving different LGBT NGOs and developing common objectives achieved a higher level of acceptance and bore greater trust-building results.WeaknessesCurrent procedures for recording statistics within government administrations are not comparable with those employed by NGO-counselling centres. Recommendations •\t The improvement of statistical recording methods in collaboration with NGO counselling centres, joint projects and the use of common terminology will permit levels of acceptance within the police authori-ties to be evaluated in order to demonstrate whether there has been an improvement, or if high levels of disapproval of LGBT people continue to exist within the police force.4. Good Practises | 127126  | Combating HomophobiaStockholm City Police Area Hate Crime Unit19 OverviewThe first step towards creating a Hate Crimes Unit in the Stockholm police was to carry out a diagnostic survey. It found that interpretations of hate crimes differed across the various administrative levels and that the police authorities were not equipped to identify hate crimes. The Hate Crime Unit was created working from the conclusions of this assessment in collaboration with local associations –among them LGBT associations. Its role was to deal with hate crimes based on race, religion or sexual orientation. This Unit came into operation in May 2007 and became permanent as of April 2009, the same time as contact officers were established in all areas of policing. At present this Unit has six full-time police officers and is part of the Stockholm Police Force. The Unit is responsible for investigating hate crimes in the city, developing working methods and coordinating training in hate crimes for the police in the Province of Stockholm. The aim of this Unit is to provide police personnel with regular training and receive feedback from all levels within the police force to provide better informa-tion and maintain an open debate on hate crimes, human rights and the importance of respect for diversity.The main objectives behind setting up the Stockholm Police Force Hate Crime Units are as follows:•\t Encourage people to report hate crimes.•\t Bring more cases of hate crime before the Courts.•\t Solve more cases of hate crime.•\t When faced with hate crime cases, to improve on the first steps that are taken as well as keep police offic-ers informed so that they can identify and investigate hate crimes, and bring them to court.•\t Develop working methods to ensure greater credibility of the police among ethnic minorities and LGBT people.It is hoped that these objectives will be achieved through the implementation of a series of measures. The following measures have been taken to encourage reporting hate crimes:•\t Construct a Police web page on hate crime for the Province of Stockholm.•\t Set up a telephone helpline and email address for the general public in the event that they have questions or require information about hate crimes.•\t Appoint link police officers in the four policing zones dealing with hate crimes.Thematic areas: Hate crime. Abstract: The Stockholm Hate Crime Unit was set up after it was found that the police lacked the tools to identify hate crimes and that very few cases were being brought before the courts. The general objectives of this Unit are to train police personnel so that they are equipped to identify, investigate and solve hate crimes, bring more such cases to court and ensure greater credibility of the police among ethnic minorities and LGBT people. This is now a permanent Unit which has been incorporated into the Stockholm Police Force.

This is handed out to the relevant personnel, such as reception staff, mobile units, community police, etc. This pro forma is also handed out and explained at training courses on hate crimes.•\t Increasing police response to hate crime scenes when a victim calls or reports a hate crime.•\t Sending forensic doctors to crime scenes to ensure evidence of possible hate crimes is collected.•\t Developing an anti-hate crime mobile office.The diagnostic survey showed that only a small number of cases of hate crimes are brought before the courts. One of the possible reasons for this is the fact that the police were working from a broader definition of hate crime than the public prosecutors. The following measures were adopted, aimed at increasing the number of hate crime cases solved and bringing more of these cases before the courts:•\t The Hate Crime Unit investigates all hate crime cases.•\t A public prosecutor was assigned to work closely with the police to facilitate sharing information and to set up guidelines for defining hate crimes.•\t A public prosecutor was assigned to work together with police officers to develop methods for assessing and investigating hate crimes with a view to bringing these cases to court.The following measures were adopted in response to the need to increase police credibility among ethnic minorities and LGBT people:•\t Assign a specific police officer for hate crimes in four of Stockholm’s policing areas.•\t Identify and actively interact with associations, organisations, shops, services and groups that are poten-tial targets of hate crimes.•\t Work towards combating illegal discrimination found in clubs, pubs and restaurants by interacting with the staff who work in these establishments.This experience contributed towards improving efficiency and legal certainty when dealing with incidents of hate crime, due to the fact that all the investigations of hate crime are carried out by the same unit. The number of cases of hate crimes brought to court rose to 17.8% in 2008, compared to a figure of 9% for the rest of the country. The main objectives of this Unit, such as increasing confidence in the police, willingness to report hate crimes and the ability of the police to detect such crimes, have been achieved as demonstrated by evaluations carried out periodically every two years.Strengths •\t Clarity of the unit’s task and mission, from management and leadership at all levels, give the unit enough space, resources, time and funding.•\t Clear communication of the unit’s objectives, internally and externally.Weaknesses •\t The unit has experienced difficulties in arguing for, and raising awareness on an issue that may be viewed 4.

In 2008, the Family Project requested help from the LGBT Office in addressing issues of homosexuality and transsexuality, the needs of same-sex families (with or without children) and families with LGBT mem-bers. Collaboration between the two services began with a meeting in which the Family Project staff learnt more about LGBT issues they had not dealt with previously. The LGBT Office also met the representatives of the two social groups which collaborate with the Family Project: the Family Policies Group (made up of the heads of the various District services) and the Family and Minors Group (made up of the association volunteers operating in the District). The meetings were an opportunity to identify and develop common goals with the Family Project: •\t Inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity as issues in the Family Project.•\t Inform and raise awareness among citizens about the changes taking place in the current definitions of family models to include homosexual families.•\t Train the District services staff and association volunteers in LGBT issues.•\t Facilitate access to District services for LGBT citizens through ad hoc staff training.The following projects were developed in the course of 2009/2010 as the result of cooperation between the services and associations: •\t Organisation of two open community events in collaboration with the University of Eastern Piedmont. The first comprised a series of lectures presenting modern family structures and the kind of relationships Thematic areas: Family.Abstract: The Family Project, which provides services for families in District 2 of Turin City Council, began collaborating with the LGBT Office in 2008.

These difficulties were overcome through a two-way exchange between the Family Project and the LGBT Office staff.Recommendations•\t Time must be devoted to information and awareness raising on LGBT-related issues in the community and the city.•\t All the community players (services and associations) must be actively involved in creating the network.•\t Actions must be long-lasting and be developed through year-to-year activity planning.CEDUCATIonComic Strip Contest against Homophobia21 Rubí, SpainOverviewIn celebration of International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia 2010 (May 17th), a comic strip contest against homophobia was held in one of the state secondary schools in Rubí. The aim was to foster respectful attitudes and behaviour towards those with different sexual orientations and gender identities, and at the same time to reflect on sexual diversity and the causes behind discriminatory behaviour.This contest was aimed at secondary school students ranging from 12 to 15 years of age. It began in March with an informative workshop in each of the town’s state secondary schools on various factors related to homophobia and which served as a platform to present the comic strip contest initiative. On May 11th, work-shops were held for 3rd and 4th year secondary school students to discuss homophobia and sexual diversity, run by a local association which deals with issues of sexual diversity. The contest was held later the same month.The contest was well received with a large number of participants: 41 students (24 girls and 16 boys) took part and a total of 26 comic strips were entered. The criteria used to evaluate the comic strips included how participants focused on the problem, the solutions put forward, creativity, language used (textual and in drawings / images) and originality. The award ceremony was attended by the counsellors involved, with 150€ awarded for the first prize, 100€ for the second prize and 50€ for the third prize. This project was publicised via a press conference, the media were informed and the contest rules were posted on municipal web pages. The project was also presented at the municipality’s Conference Agents of Equality.Since students took part this meant teacher involvement in the contest. The impact of this contest also reached parents and by extension all the town’s citizens as a result of coverage by the local press. Towns’ people were also able to see the comic strips entered for the competition in a public exhibition which ran for one month.Strengths •\t The high degree of involvement by students and awareness raising among adolescents, as well as the noteworthy support from the schools who took part.•\t As regards publicity, a key factor was choosing the date, May 17th, International Day Against Homopho-Thematic areas: Education, hate crime and hate speech.Abstract: Within the framework of the events held on May 17th, Rubí Town Council organised informa-tive workshops about sexual orientation and gender identity in the town’s secondary schools and held a comic strip contest against homophobia in one of them.Key words: Education Actors involved: Council Department for Women’s Affairs, Secondary Schools (students and teachers).

Without a doubt, they are a key factor when it comes to conveying a positive attitude towards sexual diversity.‘Education Champions’22 Sheffield, United KingdomOverviewStonewall, a UK LGBT lobbying charity, has released its third guide for those working in youth and educa-tion –including schools–, this time focusing on how to include diverse families. It covers different ways of effectively tackling all forms of homophobic bullying and contains simple, practical advice to ensure that teaching reflects the reality and diversity of 21st century family life. It also contains examples of leading schools from Stonewall’s Education Champions programme, including some from Sheffield. This programme involves Stonewall working with local authorities to conduct initial needs assessments, identify good practice and offer support to identify priority activities in tackling homophobia in schools.Work in Sheffield schools has not only provided case study and best practice material for the Stonewall guides but also broadened the reach of the Stonewall Education Champions programme. Stonewall is now developing the charter to meet local needs and to involve schools in working towards Bronze, Silver and Gold levels.The work done with young people in Sheffield includes schools and the youth services. Work with young people, including those in the GLOBAL group (Gay and Lesbian Others Becoming Leaders) also resulted in the following:•\t Producing a citywide report on bullying from the perspective of young people.•\t The involvement of a LGBT youth group and project (Fruitbowl) and ‘Indigo’, a BME LGB (Black minority ethnic lesbian gay and bisexual) group in generating wish-lists about what they would like schools to be.•\t A local survey and an anti-bullying conference at which Sir Ian McKellen addressed young people.Work with schools, including primary schools (for pupils aged 5-11 years), has involved curriculum work, policy work, school-based drama workshops and initiating a day to focus on challenging homophobic and transphobic bullying in schools (‘Spring Out’), work for National Bullying Week and LGBT History Month.Key outputs include:•\t An anti-bullying report by Sheffield Youth Council and GLOBAL (Gay and Lesbian Others Becoming Lead-ers).Thematic areas: Education, family.Abstract: Sheffield City Council has an impressive portfolio of work supporting LGBT communities and in tackling homophobia and transphobia. Work with young people has included producing a citywide re-port on bullying from the perspective of young people, a local survey and an anti-bullying conference.

It is often noted that homophobic views or comments expressed by parents can be very strong sources of prejudices which are often difficult to combat when working with children or young people.•\t There is a risk involved in linking policy to a well-known national organisation. It risks alienating those who have a negative view of that organisation and if the latter’s reputation suffers, then this can have a negative knock-on effect on the standing of one’s own work.•\t A scheme that recognises organisations' (schools') success by levels buys into the competition created between schools and could discourage those with recognised bullying from drawing attention to their point of departure or low level success on the scheme.•\t Any school-based work treads a difficult line around values: the attitudes and values of parents and the community have a powerful influence on children. However, displays of prejudice must be challenged. In the UK, at least, schools are told to respect the values of parents and community and to work within local values. This means that head teachers have to tread a thin line between these potentially contradictory guidelines.Recommendations•\t The involvement of youth LGB or LGBT groups and of Black and minority ethnic groups which can broaden perspectives and strengthen work to combat homophobia and transphobia, and can help develop actions relevant to specific local communities and cultures.•\t Linking with the national resources currently available for working with schools.•\t Offering a multi-step award scheme allows schools (or other organisations) to gain recognition for tak-ing the first steps when the environment may be particularly hostile. It can also push further those who already do a good job of challenging and eliminating homo/transphobia in schools.•\t The multiplicity of LGBT actions may help shift values and shape a more positive culture.•\t The practice of working with a school or local authority to monitor needs, seems to be effective in prioritis-ing and supporting taking actions.Schoolmates23 Vienna, AustriaOverviewHomophobia and prejudice are very common in schools. Young LGBT people and people assumed to be LGBT are discriminated against and are quite often victims of different sorts of violence. This is why reducing homophobia and heterosexism in schools is important. It is also necessary to raise awareness among and educate young people and teachers about LGBT issues and the possible effects of homophobic bullying. The need to make schools a safer place for LGBT-people was key to the «Schoolmates» project. To this end, an international survey was carried out, a workshop to combat homophobic bullying in schools was devel-oped and three handbooks on the topic of homophobic bullying: «Bullying in Class» (for students), «Bullying in School» (for teachers) and «Fighting Bullying» (workshop programme) were published.In connection with the «Schoolmates» project, the Samesex Lifestyles Anti-Discrimination Unit of the City of Vienna organised a symposium on homophobic bullying in the adult education centre «Urania» in Vienna in November 2009. This conference opened with a very well-attended press conference and presented the «Schoolmates» handbooks, the «Schoolmates» project, and raised awareness about the topic of sexual orientation and identity in schools with presentations and workshops given by international experts.

For each of these areas, four groups of beneficiaries were identified on the basis of the training needs of the Public Administration and schools: junior high school teachers, employees of Turin City Council’s Centre for Relationships and Families, the representatives of equality issues of the Province of Turin Job Centres and Turin City Council’s Municipal Police Department. In order to design training models, a three-phase process involved the following working groups:1. Methodology Working group: three experts in the field of training methodology were given the task of drawing up methodological guidelines to generate innovative and transferable training models to be tested out on four target groups (May – June 2010). 2. Training Planners’ Working group: four skilled trainers on LGBT issues had the task of designing a specific training toolkit for each group of trainees on the basis of the methodological guidelines defined by the previous working group. Experts met both trainees and stakeholders (i.e. representatives of institutions / associations that work with trainees) in order to define training needs and take them into account in the toolkit design (June – September 2010).Toolkits will be published and provided for anyone interested in starting local training courses, especially in Public Administration offices and schools.3. Trainers’ Working Group: experts on LGBT issues and adult training (as per the methodological guidelines) tested the four training toolkits in classrooms. The Training Group of the GLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board was chosen due to its expertise and its well-established collaboration with the LGBT Office (Octo-ber – November 2010).Thematic areas: Education.Abstract: This experience is one of the case studies carried out by the LGBT Office of Turin City Coun-cil within the AHEAD project. All case studies point at trying out innovative and transferable training models addressed to local public administration employees and school teachers. A three-phase process was implemented: the definition of methodological guidelines, the toolkit design and the toolkit testing.Key words: Training, education, toolkit.Actors involved: Turin City Council - LGBT Office and ITER (Institution of Turin for Responsible Educa-tion); Piedmont Regional Authority – «Equal Opportunities for All» UnitProvince of Turin - Equal Opportunities and uses of Time Policies SectorGLBT Turin Pride Coordination Board – Training GroupJunior High School «Via Sangone» in Nichelino (Turin)Several experts.Beneficiaries: Junior High School teachers.Contact details: LGBT Office: E-mail: serviziolgbt@comune.torino.it  Telephone: +390114424040 http://www.comune.torino.it/politichedigenere/4. Good Practises | 139138  | Combating HomophobiaThe project included periodical reciprocal feedback between the three above-mentioned groups. The training experience also included specific sessions devoted to evaluating the entire process.As mentioned before, one of the four training models was aimed at junior high school teachers. Formerly, the LGBT Office had only addressed training to high school teachers, but homophobic bullying in junior high schools prompted the LGBT Office to also address training to teachers working in these schools. Victims of this form of bullying are often pre-teenagers who do not comply with a specific gender role, and this behav-iour is often seen by the peer group as a «sign» of homosexuality. For this reason it is important for teacher training to start from a consideration of gender stereotypes, resulting from the rigid male/female dichotomy that persists in our culture. The toolkit for junior high school teachers was designed in four sessions (each one lasting four hours) and dealing with the following contents:•\t Homophobia and transphobia: how stereotypes and bias are created; the psychological and social roots of discrimination. •\t The formation of sexual identity: gender, gender identity, gender role, sexual orientation.•\t Gender stereotypes and sexual identity in school: how to cope with stereotypes and bias, how to welcome differences.•\t Homophobic bullying: strategies in school.The toolkit was tested on a group of seventeen teachers. The trainees were involved in several ways: brain-storming, role-play activities, showing films, documentaries and slides. This methodology was chosen in order to make interaction amongst the trainees easier.Strengths •\t Consolidation and implementation of local networks, in fact new agents became involved in this project who may continue to collaborate in the future.•\t Empowerment of the LGBT Office employees: acquisition of knowledge, expertise and new tools in de-signing training models.•\t Creation of a multi-professional working group: the presence of individuals with a variety of professional expertise allowed for a multidisciplinary methodological approach that resulted in an integrated/multi-faceted training model. •\t Empowerment of LGBT association trainers and consolidation of relationships with local LGBT asso-ciations. The testing phase brought added value both to the trainers and to the trainees. Trainers could develop their professional skills, while trainees became acquainted with associations and activities previ-ously unknown to most of them.•\t Creation of a transferable tool (training toolkit) that can be easily used in other contexts.•\t Benefits for the junior high school students and their families. Expectations resulting from this training include: a more open-minded environment and teachers better equipped to answer the needs of their students and the students’ families.WeaknessesThe various phases of the training process were designed in an excessively articulated way. This in turn caused some problems of management and interaction amongst the various actors and groups involved in the process:•\t The large number of professionals involved in the project often entailed overlapping of expertise.•\t The project term urged the professionals to produce their results within a shorter timescale than was necessary.•\t The number of meetings between the Methodological Working group and the Training Planners’ Working group was insufficient to share the feedback in the different phases of the training process.Recommendations•\t To simplify the process by reducing both the planning phases and the number of professionals involved, in order to make the training project more manageable.•\t To enable the three working groups to exchange information efficiently.•\t To plan the involvement of LGBT associations volunteers in the training activities in order to use their expertise and strengthen relationships with local associations. At the moment of writing this White Paper this training project is under evaluation and therefore a further update on the results of the junior high school training process will be published on the AHEAD website.4.

These comprised seven sessions exclusively for students, with meetings held with teachers before and after each workshop. The workshops provided the students with the chance to watch films, discuss issues, talk about key words, and design the public campaign.•\t Between September and December 2006, the campaign was developed with the assistance of a graphic designer. Eight different posters (70x100cm) and an informative flyer were produced.•\t In January and February 2007, the campaign was presented to the public.The project «Queer too Queer» (Q2Q) was designed to promote and raise awareness about queer cultures, build a sense of community and support young queer artists involved in art through networking with local and international partners.

Good Practises | 143142  | Combating HomophobiaTraining for the Health Care System26 Vienna, AustriaCHEALTHOverviewThe Vienna Hospital Association runs many hospitals, employing about 35,000 people. Prejudice and homophobia are very harmful in a hospital setting, as they can prevent patients from receiving equal and appropriate treatment. The workshops «Dealing with each other respectfully: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity», were developed in 2008 to tackle this issue. They were designed to combat prejudice and raise awareness among hospital employees about LGBT issues, reduce homophobia and heterosexism, ensure the provision of better medical services for LGBT people, foster conflict resolution skills, and bring an end to homophobic and transphobic bullying in the workplace. 18 workshops were held in 2010, each of them with about 20 participants, which were focused as follows:•\t Personnel managers (11 hours).•\t Doctors, nurses and administrative staff (11 hours).•\t Other hospital employees (of 11 hours).•\t Ambulance crews and hospital porters (16 hours).Strengths These form part of the workshop series «Dealing with each other respectfully», which tackle with the fol-lowing issues:•\t stress-reduction.•\t sexual harassment. •\t bullying and discrimination in general.•\t discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. People are encouraged to enrol for the whole series of four workshops.The four workshops are led by Mrs. Eveline Lintner-Puchner, an external psychotherapist who is known to and familiar with the participants, and Wolfgang Wilhelm from the Vienna City Council’s Same-sex Lifestyles Thematic areas: Health.Abstract: Workshops and training were provided for employees of the Health Care System of the City of Vienna aimed at combating homophobia and heterosexism, raising awareness of LGBT issues, providing better medical services for LGBT people; and reducing conflict and bullying in the workplace.

This format has proved to be successful among the participants; noteworthy features are: •\t The number of participants is limited to 20 people per workshop, in order to create a very close working atmosphere. •\t The workshops are held in the conference room of a pleasant hotel, which creates a relaxed atmosphere. Lunch is provided, helping to build trust between the participants and enable the group to work on an issue that is still considered uncomfortable. •\t The workshop has the backing of the hospital management and the Executive City Councillor for Public Health and Social Affairs.•\t Workshops and request for feedback are given a high profile by the human resource manager.•\t Run by highly qualified and experienced workshop leaders who are both psychotherapists and experi-enced in working with groups. •\t Attendance at the workshops is voluntary, but they are popular and attract many applicants, as employees understand the importance of these topics in their workplace and also in their personal lives.•\t The workshops last between 11 and 16 hours. This creates an intense working atmosphere, allowing participants’ sufficient time and a safe environment in which to discuss the issues, raise concerns, and voice prejudices, opinions, attitudes and beliefs.WeaknessesThe duration of the workshops can make attendance difficult for some participants.RecommendationsThe organisation of workshops on this scale. Dealing with these issues in the workplace can present a chal-lenge for a small unit and requires experience.4. Good Practises | 145144  | Combating HomophobiaHIV Prevention Campaign27 Paris, FranceOverviewThe HIV-aids prevention campaigns launched by Paris City Council, and directed especially at the popula-tion of men who have sex with men (MSM), are driven by the desire to respond to the reality of the epidemic, i.e. that large western urban centres continue to have a very high rate of infection among gay and bisexual men. For this reason priority was given to designing a campaign aimed specifically at spreading the message of prevention in this sector. The campaign made use of four advertising strategies. Firstly, free posters and postcards were distributed, directed at all publics, emphasizing the danger and continuing fatal nature of the illness under the title «Paris Plaisirs, Paris Capotes» (Paris Pleasures, Paris Condoms). This campaign was also launched in LGBT venues by means of their own media, associations, businesses and events connected to the LGBT sphere. Secondly, Paris City Council printed the telephone number of the free and confidential Aids Information Service helpline on the half a million condoms it distributes annually. Thirdly, campaigns specially aimed at gay men, or MSM, were run. Since 2001, Paris City Council has run a number of specific campaigns along these lines in consultation with several LGBT associations, and those involved in HIV-aids. Fourthly, the public administration also published various free leaflets about HIV-aids and sexually transmit-ted infections (STI´s) explicitly addressing MSM.Strengths •\t The principal strength of this type of campaign lies in the use made of highly entertaining and innovative ideas in order to disseminate preventative messages. In fact, the campaigns were considered to have been very successful by both the public and the media. The slogan chosen for the campaign, «Paris Plaisirs, Paris capotes», has become powerful and easily recognizable.•\t Another key factor was to also have the support of the media and the main LGBT and HIV-aids associa-tions, to adopt and spread the messages of the municipal HIV prevention campaigns. Weaknesses•\t The principal difficulty of the preventative campaigns implemented by the municipal administration was Thematic areas: Health.Abstract: Paris City Council ran specific campaigns aimed at the prevention of HIV-aids through print, radio and television advertisements. These focused on men who have sex with men and were accompa-nied by the distribution of free condoms. These campaigns have been evaluated by LGBT associations and by those fighting the spread of HIV-aids. Key words: Health, STI’s, prevention.Actors involved: The Mayor’s Office, The Director of Health and Social Affairs (DASES) and The Direc-tor of Communication (DiCom), Paris City Council, LGBT associations and those fighting the spread of HIV-aids. Beneficiaries: The population of men who have sex with men in the city of Paris. Contact details: Paris City Council (France)Mr. Lasnier- Paris City Council  Philippe.lasnier@paris.frto ensure visibility for the campaign publicity and to maintain that visibility throughout the whole year. •\t It is expensive for the local administration to maintain a continual, strong publicity campaign. This issue has created debate within the heart of the administration about whether the money invested in publicity for the preventative campaigns would have been better spent on grants for NGOs and associations who fight HIV-aids.Recommendations•\t In order to launch this type of campaign from within the local administration it is crucial that there are motivated professionals at both the political level and within the Departments of Health and Communica-tion (for example doctors, experts, associations who fight HIV-aids), who are convinced of the efficacy of the initiative.•\t Concerning the campaign contents, it is important to take into account various questions: to create mes-sages based on the reality of the state of the epidemic and of its evolution and not to conceal informa-tion from fear of the message being too harsh or offending public opinion. For example, it is extremely difficult to talk about death in this type of campaign because aids has been made invisible in daily life. Misinformation circulates to the effect that that HIV can be cured and that nowadays nobody dies of aids due to the combination drug therapies that exist, or that post-exposure treatment always protects from infection. It is important to combat these ideas by providing accurate information about the current state of the matter.•\t The message of the preventative campaigns must be clear and comprehensible to all inhabitants of the city, including immigrants and tourists who do not share the language or certain visual codes. •\t It is crucial to be aware of any implicit content preventative messages may contain. Sometimes these cam-paigns have a moralistic hue that results in people feeling judged and distances them from the general public. Furthermore, it is important to take into account that failure to use a condom might be due to a multitude of factors. For example, that people sometimes act impulsively or irrationally and should not be judged for doing so. It is also important to downplay sexual relations, put it in perspective and talk about it in all its forms. In the same way it is important to focus on the principal objective of the message, which is the use of condoms, and try to make this message more erotic. •\t This type of campaign is innovative because of its use of new technologies and other media (for example, interactive campaigns such as flashmobs) which can prove very effective at attracting the attention of the public.4. Good Practises | 147146  | Combating HomophobiaHepatitis A and B Vaccination Campaign28 Barcelona, SpainOverviewDuring 2009 Barcelona registered 200 cases of men infected with hepatitis A, the majority of whom had had sexual relations with other men. Among those infected with the illness in this period, 58% were unaware of the recommendation to be vaccinated and 20% were aware of it but had not considered vaccination to be necessary. In March 2010 the Agència de Salud Pública de Barcelona (Barcelona Public Health Agency) launched a new vaccination campaign to fight hepatitis A and B, with the aim of increasing the rates of protection in men who have sex with men. It had the further objective of contributing to the normalisation of sexual diversity within the health services.These objectives were achieved with the support of gay associations, the Consorci Sanitari de Barcelona (Barcelona Health Consortium) and other health institutes. Thousands of postcards were distributed, posters were put up and a banner posted on the internet, which all contained messages encouraging vaccination. A media campaign was also conducted in the city’s Primary Care Centres, Barcelona Public Health Agency’s Vaccination Centre, and in meeting places for sex. This campaign supplemented the project carried out by the Agency in collaboration with the LGBT movement, the sector’s business men and women and promoters of activities aimed at the gay public, in which free vaccination has been offered in some saunas and vac-cination centres since 2004. In the 5 years since the campaign was launched more than 2,800 men have been vaccinated. Strengths •\t Contributes to the improvement in health services received by the population of men who have sex with men (MSM).•\t Helps normalise sexual diversity in health centres.•\t Stems from the existence of a previous collaborative programme with LGBT bodies.•\t Has a system of evaluation that permits the process to be monitored.Weaknesses•\t At the moment of writing this white paper this project is under evaluation and therefore information about the difficulties encountered is not available.Thematic areas: Health.Abstract: Since 2004 the Barcelona Public Health Agency has conducted a Hepatitis A and B vaccina-tion campaign, aimed specifically at men who have sex with men (MSM), in primary health care centres, saunas and at meeting places for sex in Barcelona.Key words: Health, STI’s, prevention.Actors involved: Barcelona City Council, primary health care centres, pharmacies.

Its core message was to encourage athletes to accept their sexuality and to challenge athletes and sports clubs, among others, to take up the fight against homophobia. The campaign involved putting up posters in various sports facilities and was organised by a group of four young Finnish volunteers. Support for the campaign was voiced on the website by the Chairperson for the Committee for Equality and Sports and also through the European Commission programme «Youth In Ac-tion».The campaign was launched in August 2009 by its main partners, the Finnish Sports Federation and SETA, the leading Finnish LGBT rights organization. The campaign received backing from President Tarja Halonen and the Minister of Culture and Sport, Stefan Wallin.Strengths •\t The very high level endorsement for this campaign lends it status and brings the issue of challenging homophobia into the mainstream.•\t The high quality posters and their appealing design helped in the success of this campaign. The design itself constructs homophobia as passé and also, perhaps significantly, as unhelpful for sport.•\t It seems that the message is explicit once decoded and yet the posters are interesting rather than unim-aginatively direct. Weaknesses•\t The world of sport is full of gender normativity and segregation whereas this campaign focuses only on homophobia and not even consider heterosexism.•\t The majority of professional LGBT sportsmen and women are not open publically about their sexual orien-tation or gender identity, leaving the homophobic culture of everyday sports unchallenged.Thematic areas: Sports.Abstract: The City of Vantaa ran a poster campaign in sports facilities that sought to challenge homo-phobia, raise LGB visibility and encourage lesbian, gay and bisexual people to feel more comfortable with their sexual orientation, and to make sports facilities safer. The campaign’s posters were appealing and thought-provoking, using the metaphor of «team members’ different strengths» and managed to represent homophobia as passé. High level endorsement, from the President and Minister for Sport, was published on the web and the campaign was devised in collaboration with the national LGBT lobby group and the national sports body.

Good Practises | 151150  | Combating HomophobiaC‘A Minute’s Noise on IDAHO’30 Sheffield, United KingdomCULTUrEOverviewThe fourth International Day Against Homophobia (IDAHO) on May 17th 2008, sought to raise awareness about the impact of homophobia on the lives of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people throughout the world and also on the lives of their families, friends and colleagues. To mark this day, Sheffield City Council and the Centre for HIV and Sexual Health held an event to speak out loudly and clearly that homo-phobia is just not acceptable by holding a 'one minute’s noise' (instead of the usual one minute’s silence). Over 200 people attended the event, which was a wonderful example of people gathering together to hear a number of speakers, including the Leader of the Council, pledge support and call for an end to homophobia throughout the world. The event ended with a performance by the new Sheffield LGBT Choir 'Out Aloud'.Extracts from the city’s Community Cohesion Strategy illustrate several aspects of good practice, such as, directly naming the LGBT community and other specific communities in general texts, explicitly making inter-community knowledge and understanding a goal, and having strategies to achieve this:«Sheffield is now home to some of the UK’s wealthiest households and some of its poorest. The city has experienced a growth in economic migrants and refugees alongside more established black and minority ethnic communities and a more visible lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. There is an increasing polarisation of the population with increased numbers of adults aged over 60 years and rising numbers of young people.»The Council Leader, Paul Scriven, stated in his Foreword to A Strategy for Community Cohesion in November 2008 that:«The Council will work proactively to identify where different groups may not get along and how we can support individuals to work together better. I want all our partners to follow this example and to help each other in doing so.’ ‘One of the ways I will help this happen is with an annual ‘In My Shoes’ event in the city. Shoes will be placed across the city, with stories about the shoe’s owner placed inside. People will be able to read the stories of different people in the city and so try ‘to stand in their shoes’. I believe that the more we understand each other, the harder it is to be intolerant and the easier it is to work together on the things we all care about.»Thematic areas: Culture.Abstract: Sheffield City Council have an impressive portfolio of work supporting the LGBT communi-ties and to tackling homophobia and transphobia, one small aspect of which was their «One Minute’s Noise», which they first used to mark International Day Against Homophobia in 2008. They believe they were the first to engage people in noise-making as opposed to ‘a minute’s silence’.Key words: IDAHO, symbolic support, commemoration.Actors involved: Sheffield City Council, the Centre for HIV and Sexual Health (Sheffield), Sheffield First Partnership, LGBT community.Beneficiaries: LGBT community, Council Leaders and officers, the general population.

A fun, light-hearted action might draw more support (and positive attention from onlookers) than a complaint- or discrimination-focused action which can reinforce LGBT victim status.•\t High level support for LGBT equality initiatives from the Council Leadership is an important contribution to the success here.Weaknesses•\t A weakness of this symbolic event might be that it risks ‘preaching to the converted’ since only those who are supportive of it will attend or take part. However, media coverage and the reporting in policy docu-ments would help to publicise it and achieve its aim.Recommendations•\t The speakers will ideally be prominent figures and speeches need to be positive, short and pithy, and up-beat. •\t A choir, samba band or other organised groups can contribute noise and structure to the event and help round off a programme making it more appealing and likely to attract people. •\t Making use of an existing audience or event to ‘piggy back’ on can be helpful to provide critical mass or establish an event that on its own might not be enough to attract an audience.4. Good Practises | 153152  | Combating HomophobiaThe DIVERSA Festival of LGBTI culture31 Elx, SpainOverviewThe DIVERSA festival of LGBTI culture has been celebrated since 2008. Its principal objectives are to foster the visibility of and reflection about lesbian, gay, transsexual, bisexual and intersexual (LGBTI) culture and to work towards a more plural society which is respectful to sexual diversity. The festival attempts to show various perspectives and experiences of LGBTI people, and combat the expression of heterosexist discrimination towards sexual diversity such as sexism, homophobia and transphobia. The project provides an interactive space that functions not only as a place for meeting and discussion between members of the LGBTI collective and the rest of society, but also as a setting for communication and self-learning within the collective. It promotes the active participation of the public in various activities of the festival. Furthermore, the festival reclaims the public space as an experiential and political stage for people whose sexualities are marginalised, and their sympathisers. The DIVERSA festival is also a place for spreading the message of creativity that welcomes local artists working in areas related to LGBTI culture.In addition to the service and administrative support staff, the designer, the web programmers and various social agents who collaborate in specific activities, every year an average of 15 people participate in the design and development of this event. Depending on the activities planned each year (round table discus-sions, discussions, teaching units with students, exhibitions of concrete projects, etc.), involvement is sought from cultural institutions such as museums, libraries and universities, of health care centres such as hospitals, specific customer service departments, local businesses (bookshops, shops, bars, etc), as well as that of na-tional LGBTI associations dealing with similar themes. Finance is a variable factor year on year, with the total budget fluctuating between 70,000€ and 100,000€.The ultimate goal of festival DIVERSA is to increase in the public visibility of sexual-emotional diversity, and anti-discriminatory policies to promote not only artistic and cultural creativity, but also respect between citizens.Strengths •\t Festival DIVERSA is the only festival of LGBTI culture in Spain run by a public administration, namely, the Institut Municipal de Cultura d’Elx (Elche Municipal Institute of Culture). Therefore, without a doubt the great wealth of this event lies in the commitment and approval by the local administration, the variety of festival events, and the plurality as much in the festival production as well as in its audience.•\t Another strength that stands out is the festival’s marked educational and reflective character. The festival Thematic areas: Culture, participation. Abstract: This festival of LGBTI culture has been celebrated since 2008 as an initiative of the Institut Municipal de Cultura d’Elx (Elx Municipal Institute of Culture). The festival hosts events including, among other initiatives, projections, debates, exhibitions, teaching modules for students, and conferences, all focusing on the LGBTI theme. Key words: Culture, festival, visibility.Actors involved: The Elx City Council Municipal Institute of Culture, LGBT associations.Beneficiaries: The LGBT population as well as other citizens of Elx and neighbouring municipalities.Contact details: Elx City Council- (Spain)Institut Municipal de Cultura d'Elx (Elx Municipal Institute of Culture) (CCCE L'Escorxador)  info@centrelescorxador.com  www.centrelescorxador.comdoes not aim to create a purely recreational festive space, but rather also to provide theoretical content through debate forums.Weaknesses•\t The greatest difficulties lie in bringing the events closer to a non LGBTI public and making sure the festival reaches all citizens. Nevertheless, during the successful third festival, held in 2010, the number of partici-pants and spectators increased. •\t Although this project may be a way of making the LGBTI collective more visible, it remains sporadic and concentrated in one month. Furthermore, it is dependent on whichever party is in government at the time and is very vulnerable to budget cuts.•\t It is a major challenge to condense various perspectives and outlooks on LGBTI culture into the same festival. The difficulty lies in agreeing on common criteria that cover the various LGBTI experiences. •\t At the time of promoting these projects there is a risk that policies that are anti-discriminatory will be limited to a few sporadic events, without permeating the rest of the local authority’s social and political actions. Recommendations•\t It is very important to be clear about the aims of the project and, if possible, to count on the collabora-tion of social agents and specialist collaborators to produce a coherent project which avoids resorting to stereotypes. •\t The objective of DIVERSA is to promote contemporary creation and reflection by opening spaces for shar-ing studies that would otherwise not reach the city of Elx. It is also a way of promoting sexual-emotional education among young people, above all where no established model exists in approaches to sexual-emotional diversity in primary and secondary schools.4. Good Practises | 155154  | Combating HomophobiaLe point G: Resource Centre for sexual and gender identity, gay and lesbian memory32 Lyon, FranceOverviewPoint G is a centre which attempts to provide a space for expressing issues concerning gender (transgen-der, intersex and feminisms) and sexualities (LGB), from an intellectual perspective and with an open, comprehensive and dynamic approach.The goal of this project is to provide a heritage collection (archive collections and searches for old documents in our own collections) and current documents and publications, and to house this within a public establish-ment which is central to the life of the people of Lyon (a yearly average of 1 million people visit the building which houses the resource centre). The project was set up with the objective of giving life, depth, visibility and legitimacy to LGBT issues, and to include them within a public establishment rather than relegate them to a separate location. This proposal deals with the question of cultural and academic activities being open to all people, and attempts to reduce homophobia and all types of exclusion linked to sexuality and gender.This project by the Lyon Council and Library initially dealt with «gay and lesbian historical memory», but this focus was later redefined to go beyond links with the past and include the present day and be open to other cultural systems. The initiatives being carried out at present are as follows:•\t Create a multi-disciplinary collection (with writers and scientists from the last 15 years).•\t Carry out an inventory of the entire library’s collections (3,500,000 documents) to facilitate searches for pertinent documents.•\t Collaborate across departments specialising in particular areas (arts, society, etc.) in order to demonstrate that this issue applies to all intellectual and social sectors, in addition to involving the entire library staff in this project.•\t Set up a web page to give information about, and visibility to, activities and resources.At present there is a joint effort to set up a collaborative agreement with the International Master of Social Sciences in gender studies at the University of Lyon 2.Point G also collaborates in a number of events held in Lyon related to LGBT concerns, for example, LGBT film festivals, and the interdisciplinary think tank on intersexuality «Reference Centre for rare diseases with sexual differentiation ‘anomalies’» at the Hospital Femme Mère Enfant de Lyon. Thematic areas: Education, information. Abstract: Point G is a centre for documentation and information about gay and lesbian historical mem-ory, which was set up by the Municipal Library of Lyon in 2006. Point G also organises events such as exhibitions and conferences and has become a focal point for the city’s LGBT culture.Key words: Culture, historical memory.Actors involved: Municipal Library.Beneficiaries: The population as a whole and particularly queers, gays, lesbians, transsexuals, intersex and feminist people.Contact details: Lyon City Council (France)Municipal Library of Lyon  stomolillo@bm-lyon.fr http://www.bm-lyon.fr/lepointg/In its early days, between 2007 and 2009, the National Book Centre gave financial backing to creating a contemporary multi-disciplinary collection and there have been various donations that have played a very important role in the task of documenting this collective memory. At present the project employs one person on a part time basis. The employee is an anthropologist specialised in issues which included gender, sexuality, queer theory, STI prevention and public health.Strengths •\t First, this project has a number of strong points, the first being its wealth of documentary resources and materials.•\t Second, a key factor to ensuring genuine commitment to making this project visible was the desire of the directors of Lyon Municipal Library to make this project one of the library’s cultural policy priorities. In addition, the process of launching this project has raised awareness within the Library as a whole (the Municipal Library of Lyon has a total of 500 staff offering 24 services) as well as among its political and administrative counterparts in the city council.•\t Third, the on-going collaboration between those running the library services and the university and local collectives working in areas such as film, transgender identity, same-sex parenthood.•\t Finally, the personal involvement and interest shown by the qualified staff member who coordinates the resource centre, which goes far beyond fulfilling formal responsibilities, and her efforts to promote this project.Weaknesses•\t The main difficulty is the number of available staff. As mentioned earlier, Point G only has one part time employee and consequently she is burdened with most of the responsibility for this project.•\t The scarcity of previous similar projects in the public sector can complicate and slow down development. Often the specific needs of the project are not taken into account – the provision for human resources serves as a good example. In 2010, it was not possible to hold the annual Conference on Gay and Lesbian Memory, due to lack of personnel.•\t From a political point of view, the weakest point of the project lies in the challenge to ally a «neutral» public service with local active collectives and achieve effective cooperation.Recommendations•\t Cultural institutions such as public libraries have a twofold mission: they serve as a repository for heritage and need to keep abreast of changes in contemporary society. Therefore, their mission requires them to include gender and sexual orientation issues in their information and mediation services.•\t In order to meet their mission of providing spaces for learning, leisure and social activities to the whole population, public libraries are required to be open and visible to LGBTQI minorities to prevent their exclu-sion. This visibility helps to promote respect for diversity among the citizens as a whole. In more specific terms, this means increasing the visiblity in the reading rooms of specialised documentary collections on issues of gender and sexuality, drawing out the transversal nature of these issues without isolating them intellectually or socially.•\t Preserve heritage and propose events (conferences, showing films, meetings etc.) on LGBTQI issues for library users as a whole in collaboration with the LGBTQI associations.•\t Establish bridges between citizens and academics involved in the fields of gender and sexuality.4. Good Practises | 157156  | Combating Homophobia‘Read Dating’33 Manchester, United KingdomOverviewManchester City Council hosted several events for LGBT History Month 2010. LGBT History month was inspired by Black History Month, and seeks to celebrate diversity and to break the silence surrounding the lives of people who do not conform to conventional notions of sexuality and gender. The Council has celebrated LGBT History Month for five years now, and publicises it generally as well as seeking to pro-vide targeted services for LGBT users during the month. The aim is to reduce discrimination against, or the isolation that can be experienced by LGBT people.. This year included the Lesbian and Gay Choir performing in the city’s key venue (Central Library), LGBT poetry readings, an LGBT Archive history talk and a talk on LGBT individuals and military service and a new «Read Dating» event. «Read Dating» is based on the idea of «speed dating» except that people were invited to bring their favourite book or DVD to talk about for a few minutes with another individual, before moving around to the next person. The emphasis on dating was removed or reduced by this focus and hence a relaxed, friendly and sociable event allowed new contacts and potential friends to be made. Most attendees brought books and some shared poetry.The event was organised by the Library Service which is proud of its year-round engagement with the LGBT community, but takes the opportunity of LGBT History Month to carry out surveys to assess the level of sat-isfaction among LGBT customers in key aspects of the Library service, for example, collections and customer service, and to develop new ideas for meeting the needs of LGBT library users.Strengths •\t This novel idea for an event has the primary strength of creating a light-hearted, social event that facili-tates conversations between people that have not met before. The focus on a book or DVD creates a ready ice-breaker, and avoids Speed Dating’s focus on the self.•\t Another of its strengths is that it creates a social event that might appeal to LGBT people who are elderly, but does not target them in a way that problematises or pathologises the elderly. Indeed it is an event that can be advertised as inviting the participation of the whole LGBT community and it might enable social contact and facilitate friendships across the generations, itself a socially supportive and desirable outcome.Thematic areas: Culture.Abstract: Among the events that Manchester City Council hosted for LGBT History Month 2010, was an original event called «Read Dating». Based on the idea of «Speed Dating», «Read Dating» invited people to bring their favourite book or DVD to talk about for a few minutes with each participating individual, before moving around to the next person. The emphasis on dating was reduced or removed by this focus on books or DVDs, creating an informal and relaxed social event that enabled new contacts and potential friendships to be made.Key words: Social contact, cultural events - LGB History Month, library services.Actors involved: Manchester City Council Library Service.Beneficiaries: LGBT community, Library Services, the general population.Contact details: Manchester City Council (UK) www.manchester.gov.ukLead Officer on Gay Men’s Issues, Organisational Improvement and Service Inclusion team  Jon Atkin, j.atkin1@manchester.gov.uk +44 – (0) 161 – 234 1828 •\t A strength of this event was its accessibility to sections of the community that feel marginalised by or disinterested in the gay ‘scene’. Being hosted by the Library Service meant that those who may not be comfortable attending a publically identified LGBT venue might attend. It offered an accessible and alcohol-free venue and provided an alternative meeting place to the commercial gay scene, which does not appeal to everyone or welcome all equally. Weaknesses•\t This event makes use of people’s familiarity with Speed Dating and therefore carries the potential risk either of misunderstandings or of reinforcing the idea that LGBT socialising centres exclusively on dating. Some people might be put off the event because of its association with Speed Dating.•\t The other difficulty is that it has the potential to exclude those who cannot read or are not confident about their English or literary knowledge/understanding. However, the publicising of the event as about ‘books or DVDs’ can help avoid or reduce this form of exclusion.Recommendations•\t The focus of the conversations should include a range of media (books, DVDs, songs, films) to ensure the event is accessible to all and avoids excluding people on the grounds of language and literacy.•\t The Library Service provides an ideal venue for such social events for its accessibility and lack of associa-tion with either the LGBT community, the commercial scene or with alcohol.•\t This type of event need not be restricted to LGBT History Month, but could be hosted throughout the year. A series of such events could have various suggested themes or could even focus on music, songs or poetry, etc.4. Good Practises | 159158  | Combating HomophobiaCTransgender Employees’ Toolkit34 Brighton & Hove, United KingdomTrAnSGEnDEr PEoPLEOverviewThe Toolkit, probably the first of its kind in the UK, affirms the Council’s commitment to equality and fairness and to all employees being treated with dignity and respect. It upholds the objective that all work environments should to be free of harassment and bullying, hence the Toolkit being made avail-able to all employers in the borough. The Toolkit seeks to be practical and to provide advice and guidance for managers to confidently engage with, and to enable the effective inclusion of, transgender people in the workplace. Accordingly, it therefore outlines the responsibilities of employers and of employees, as well as support mechanisms and services available. The Toolkit applies to all council staff, and schools are advised to adopt it as a framework to ensure that they comply with legal obligations and support the inclusion and well-being of transgender staff. Since its creation in October 2000, it has been updated in line with the UK’s Equality Act 2010. Its existence is noted by SE Employers, the main body for local authorities sharing information (in the South East region) and it has been sent to one council on request.In addition to creating the Toolkit, on Transgender Day of Remembrance last year (November 21st 2009), Brighton and Hove Council flew the Transgender flag from both of its town hall buildings and held an exhibi-tion at the public library.Strengths •\t The creation and adoption of the Toolkit itself is a powerful symbol of commitment to supporting the Transgender community and a direct channel to educate employers to further their understanding and awareness of the issues facing transgender people. Whilst their legal status in the UK may have improved rapidly in recent years, the impact and symbolic value of such actions as the creation of this Toolkit for cultural change cannot be underestimated.•\t Any and all attempts to improve understanding and recognition of the legal situation can be valuable. For instance, the Toolkit reminds employers that even without the issuing of a full gender recognition certificate under the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, people still have the right to permanently live and work in the gender of their choosing.Thematic areas: Employment, transgendered people, recognition.Abstract: Brighton & Hove City Council’s Human Resources Department worked in partnership with The Gender Trust (Brighton) to create the Transgender Toolkit which was implemented last year. The Toolkit provides practical guidance for managers on employing transgender staff and therefore supports the effective inclusion of transgender people in the work place. In addition, the Council provides symbolic support for the Trans community and seeks to eliminate discrimination and bullying in any form in its services and by local employers. The Toolkit is a workplace support document, created for the Council’s own staff but made available to local employers, as well as schools.Key words: Transgender, employees, support for employers, symbolic support.Actors involved: Brighton & Hove City Council, The Gender Trust, Brighton (www.gendertrust.org.uk), LGBT Workers’ Forum.Beneficiaries: LGBT community as employees, local employers, council employees.Contact details: Brighton & Hove City CouncilJonathan Armitt, Human Resources Department jonathan.armitt@brighton-hove.gov.uk•\t A strength of this document lies in its practicality. Particular areas of recruitment and management prac-tice are discussed and the law and good practice clarified, such as, the legal allowance payable to some-one of a particular gender (for instance, for personal care-work) and data protection issues (covering, for instance, a manager who is asked for a reference for previous employee who has since changed gender). Weaknesses•\t The only difficulty identified in its own Equality Impact Assessment is the potential for its introduction to prompt the expression of unfavourable personal opinions or hostility. Two supportive factors will be managers who have been given training on the Toolkit and its introduction, and acknowledging the status of or high-level endorsement of the report.Recommendations•\t There is a great need for education on this issue and the symbolic value of adopting or endorsing a Toolkit that identifies Transgender people as facing equality issues is immense. Brighton has a significant LGBT community (estimated at 20-25%) but this does not eliminate discrimination. The Toolkit or a similar ap-proach might be usefully adopted by Councils elsewhere. •\t High level endorsement of the pack is valuable to support it among potentially hostile or ill-informed personal opinions.4. Good Practises | 161160  | Combating HomophobiaProtocol for recognising the identity of  transgender people35 Barcelona, SpainOverviewWithin the framework of the Municipal Plan for the LGBT collective (see good practice 2), the Regi-doria de Drets Civils (Civil Rights Advisory Council) outlines a series of specific measures focusing on the transgender collective. Noteworthy among these measures is the recognition of the chosen names and of the gender identity of transgender people throughout the local authority even if the changes have not gone through legal channels.Currently, the Spanish Law 15/20076 «Ley reguladora de la rectificaciones registral de la mención relativa al sexo de las personas» («Law regulating procedures for amending gender in the civil register»), establishes that transgender people can change their gender and name in the Civil Register, if they fulfil two requisites: a psychiatric diagnosis stating that they suffer from «gender dysphoria», and a medical certificate verifying that they have undergone at least two years of body modification treatment. The law considers that in exceptional circumstances, body modification treatment is not required if it is inadvis-able for reasons of health or age.On reaching adulthood, it can take a minimum of two years from the moment at which a transgender person starts their gender reassignment process until they secure a change in their documentation. Furthermore, there are some transgender people who are unable, or do not wish, to follow the protocols set out by psychi-atric units specialised in gender reassignment. Moreover immigrants, even those with the right of residence, are unable to benefit from the above mentioned law. So, although the law is a step forward as it does not require sex reassignment or divorce, it does not completely resolve the situation.From the point at which transgender people start their transition until they secure legal recognition of their name and gender identity there is an interim period during which a person’s documentation does not match their identity. There are many situations when dealing with municipal services, in which a citizen must iden-tify themselves. This routine, that for the majority of people is merely an ordinary day-to-day procedure, is problematic for transgender people, because their documentation does not correspond to their image and identity, and revealing their transsexuality puts them at risk of discrimination and abuse. Although the City Council do not have the authority to change a person’s name and gender in the Civil Reg-ister, they can modify those documents issued by the local administration itself, such as library card or public gym membership, or the lists of members of educational and health centres. Previously, the local administration had commissioned a report to guarantee the legality of these kinds of Thematic areas: Transgender.Abstract: Barcelona City Council has established common criteria for all council departments that per-mit transgender people to change their name on personal documentation issued by the City Council and contingent organisations, even in cases where a legal name change has not been carried out. Further-more, it has established a protocol to cover all municipal services containing agreed guidelines, criteria and specific recommendations in relation to dealing with transgender persons. Key words: Transgender, legal identity, Local Administration.Actors involved: City council and local administration employees. Beneficiaries: Transgender persons living in Barcelona. Contact details: Barcelona City Council (Spain)Municipal Plan for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Community dretscivils@bcn.cat  www.bcn.cat/dretscivils modifications and to ensure that they are in accord with related European legislation. On receiving ap-proval, the City Council established a protocol for the recognition of the gender identity and chosen name of transgender people in municipal documentation. It was envisaged that during the implementation of this protocol, all frontline local administration staff working directly with the public would be informed of the importance of this kind of modification and about how to carry it out. Strengths•\t On a practical level, it makes it easier for transgender people to carry out different local administrative procedures without encountering difficulties due to their gender identity, although it may not be a defini-tive solution. At a symbolic level, the objective of this procedure is to recognise and empower transgender people. Weaknesses•\t One of the risks involved with this innovative measure is failing to put it into practice due to lack of awareness. This protocol can only work if its principal actors are aware of it. So it is essential to circulate it among transgender people and municipal staff. Recommendations•\t To train the local administration staff who work in municipal customer service departments, to raise awareness of these protocols and how they should be applied. It is fundamental to sensitize all staff about the situation of transgender people and the problems derived from living with a gender identity that does not correspond with that assigned at birth, stressing that the protocol should be followed without questioning the life journey or trajectory of the transgender person, given that intimate questions such as these are disrespectful of a person’s privacy.•\t To make these measure known so that transgender people can make use of them in any city public service. When generating and disseminating informative material it is important to collaborate with associations and utilise meeting places for transgender people.6.

Good Practises | 163162  | Combating HomophobiaCLGTB ELDErLYLGBT elderly36 Barcelona, SpainOverviewThe Institut de l‘Envelliment de la UAB (the UAB Institute of Ageing) was commissioned by Barcelona City Council to design and carry out an event to combat the homophobia that exists in day centres for the elderly, within the framework of the European AHEAD Project.The objective of the event was to open, for the first time, a place for dialogue about homosexuality and elderly people in various municipal day centres in Barcelona in order to increase awareness of the repression that is a daily reality for elderly lesbian and gay people. The cornerstone of this event was the participation of elderly users of day centres. A core group composed of interested elderly people worked with a researcher from the Institute of Ageing for three sessions. Together, they watched the documentary «Coming out of the closet at 60» (directed by Ana Isabel Muñoz in 2006) about elderly gay and lesbian people in Barcelona, and they discussed and debated proposals about how to organize a film forum using this documentary. The next step consisted of the core group independently deciding on a format with which they felt comfortable, then launching the film forum with the assistance of people from the Institute of Ageing and with the support of the professionals who direct and organise activities in the day centres.In total seven day centres from two city districts were involved and 12 elderly people (6 men and 6 women) volunteered to participate in the core group, «one of whom was an elderly gay man». The group showed themselves to be open and interested in debating the issues of elderly gay and lesbian people and finding common ground in problems derived from ageing. Some people raised the difficulty of tackling the problem of HIV in the first film forum and proposed holding a subsequent film forum specifically related to this issue. When it came to transsexuality, a lack of awareness and the existence of many stereotypes came out, as well as the necessity to learn more about the issue before addressing it in a film forum. Two film forums were organised. The first was attended by 43 people (10 men and 33 women) and the second by 49 people (13 men and 36 women). An elderly HIV positive gay man who had appeared in the documentary, as well as two elderly lesbian women, were invited to the second film forum. Participation in Thematic areas: Elderly.Abstract: This project consists of the creation of a place for dialogue about homosexuality and older people in several of the city’s municipal day centres (Casals) through two film forums. The design and monitoring of the project was carried out by the Institut de l’Envelliment de la Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona (The Institute of Ageing), who organised the events and assisted the older people in the process of decision-making about how to approach this matter. Key words: Elderly. Actors involved: Municipal LGBT Plan, Director of the City Council Social Welfare Services, The Insti-tute of Ageing, directors of municipal day centres and users of the day centres for older people. Beneficiaries: The elderly users of day centres and LGBT elderly. Contact details: Barcelona City Council (Spain)Municipal Plan for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Community dretscivils@bcn.cat  www.bcn.cat/dretscivils  Institut Català de l’Envelliment de la Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona http://www.envelliment.org/the debates was intense, with contributions falling into three basic types: expressing pity and sadness on discovering the suffering of homosexual people during the repression of Franco’s regime; the sharing of posi-tive daily life experiences with homosexual people (to do with the family, neighbourhood, professional life, professionals who deal with them); and asking questions that they still had about homosexuality. A minority of contributors were clearly homophobic and expressed no desire to change. In general, the participants were extremely satisfied with the event and a strong interest in continuing to debate and learn about the issue was expressed. This event was intended to appeal to elderly people, in this case elderly heterosexual users of day centres, to combat discrimination against elderly homosexual people. Strengths •\t High degree of interest among elderly people in forming part of a core group to work on the issue of homosexuality. The day centre professionals who were involved in the project were surprised at how easy it was to recruit people for these tasks. •\t The key to the success of the first film forum was the trust that existed between the elderly day centre us-ers and the centres’ professional staff, and the management of the project by the Institute of Ageing staff. •\t It also proved important that all those involved only undertook tasks they felt capable of carrying out and that each person’s abilities were encouraged and their limitations respected. Weaknesses•\t A lack of awareness on the part of managers, assistants, activity organisers and elderly people about the problem of homophobia in day centres. It proved difficult for people to accept the suggestion that the absence of elderly homosexual people in day centres might be indicative of the possibility of their feeling excluded.•\t The day centres have their own rhythms and interests and as the event was not their own initiative, it may have suffered by being seen as an external imposition. •\t Part of the success of the event was the active, sustained involvement of those elderly people and profes-sionals involved at different project levels. This event required the dedication of a lot of time: coordination, information, and presence at meetings.•\t The management of film forums, where elderly gay and lesbian people share space with people with explicit homophobic attitudes, which is no easy task.Recommendations•\t Various obstacles have to be overcome in order to integrate the LGBT perspective into the area of elderly people: the stereotypes about older people held by elderly people themselves as well as those held by the professional staff. For example, imagining elderly people to be a homogenous collective and viewing them as non-sexual, lacking an active sexual life are views which need to be critically challenged. •\t The role of professionals who work in the field of older people is also a key consideration. •\t One of the principal obstacles is that the (apparent) absence of openly LGBT people in centres for older people results in a lack of awareness by the professional staff of the specific issues of older LGBT people. In fact, the absence or very minor presence of older LGBT people in these centres is not indicative of an absence of problems, but rather the complete opposite. It demonstrates that LGBT people are discrimi-nated against, excluded and afraid of being open.•\t It is fundamental to create a climate of trust and understanding, provide definitions and information to counteract stereotypical ideas and take great care with the language used to discuss these themes.BibliographyChapter 55.
