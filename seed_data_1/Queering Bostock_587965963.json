INTRODUCTIONRegarding queer identities, 1 the enduring misconceptions about sexual andgender identities underscore precisely why queer lived experiences are critically salient for understanding and remedying instances of discrimination.2 Without substantively acknowledging the lived experiences of discrimination, one danger is that the dominant establishment more easily retains the posture of redressing discrimination as a means for preserving a discriminatory status quo. For instance, where anti-subordination approaches might better detect and address the inequalities of a marginalized group's lived experiences than anti-classification approaches,3 scholars have noted that the establishment's choice to maintain anti-classification approaches allows the status quo to reify its dominant values-especially when such formal equality treatments replicate structural hierarchies favoring the status quo.4 Likewise, when comparing different equality 1. For inclusivity and for this work's critical lens, I prefer to use terms such as \"queer identities,\" \"queer minorities,\" and \"LGBTQ identities,\" rather than terms, such as \"gay\" or \"lesbian.\" Where possible, I do observe the distinctions between \"queer\" and \"LGBTQ\" as well. Although \"queer\" is historically pejorative, its reclamation in recent decades also invests the term with much subversive power. Also, I use \"homosexuality\" and its derivatives solely in historical context or to underscore their limitations. Where appropriate and respectful to do so, I replace the term \"homosexuality\" with \"queerness.\" All errors of reference are my own. 2. See generally Nancy Levit, A Different Kind of Sameness: Beyond Formal Equality and Antisubordination Strategies in Gay Legal Theory, 61 OHIO ST. L.J. 867 , 868, 931 (2000) [hereinafter Levit, A Different Kind of Sameness]. Levit posits that because \"popular construction of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered individuals as deviant has fostered novel forms of homophobia,\" such construction \"necessitates increasing visibility, combating untrue media representations, and replacing the dominant cultural images with more accurate portrayals of the lived experiences of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transsexuals.\" Id. at 868, 931 (footnote omitted). 3. See e.g., Ronald Turner, On Neutral and Preferred Principles of Constitutional Law, 74 U. PITT. L. REV. 433,481 (2013) (preferring an approach to anti-discrimination based within \"recognition of an antisubordination or nonsubordination principle grounded in the reality that racial segregation, as a matter of history and practice and lived experiences, has an asymmetrical legal and social meaning for blacks and whites and does not symmetrically burden those on different sides of the color line\") (footnotes omitted). 4. Anti-classification approaches reflected in disparate treatment solutions demonstrates this observation. See Jack M. Balkin & Reva B. Siegel, The American Civil Rights Tradition: Anticlassification or Antisubordination?, 58 U. MIAMI L. REV. 9, 21 (2003) (aligning disparate treatment doctrine with anti-classificationist approaches). Linda Hamilton Krieger has noted that in the Title VII realm, disparate treatment jurisprudence ignores the lived experience as \"current disparate treatment jurisprudence does not recognize that categorization based on race, sex, or national origin may distort 2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 285 approaches used to conceptualize and redress discrimination against queer minorities, Russell Robinson and David Frost urge that \"□Judges should make decisions with a full understanding of LGBT people's lives, not just the slivers that lawyers sometimes choose to serve up to them.\"5 Relying on a singular perspective that does not fully contextualize LGBTQ experiences could be \"problematic if presented alone, because isolating one [perspective] or the other fails to represent the whole of sexual minorities' lived experiences.\"6 Specifically, when sameness arguments are used to justify legal advancements, Robinson and Frost allude to some significant distinctions amongst LGBTQ experiences that are often obscured: \"As LGBT people, we may have the same basic desires and life goals as heterosexuals and yet face unique forms of stress as we seek to achieve those goals. These barriers extend far beyond the availability of a marriage license, and courts should know that.\"7 In this way, they observe that limited reflections of the LGBTQ experience in recent marriage cases contributed to \"the judicial struggle to enforce equal protection while minimally disrupting the status quo and extricating the courts from extended structural reform.\"8 Without doubt, the Supreme Court's 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia9 illustrates this conundrum. As expected, much fanfare hastrailed the Court's decision to finally settle whether Title VII's sex discrimination protections also shield individuals from sexual orientation and gender identity employment discrimination. 10 Because employment perception, memory, and recall for decision-relevant events such that, at the moment of decision, an employer may be entirely unaware of the effect of an employee's group membership on the decisionmaking process.\" Linda Hamilton Krieger, The Content of Our Categories: A Cognitive Bias Approach to Discrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity, 47 STAN.

TIMES (June 15, 2020), https://www.nytimes.com/ 2020/06/15/us/ gay-trans gender-workers-supreme-court.html. 286 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 discrimination protections have been long-sought by LGBTQ movements, the decision is enormously significant and resolves the absurdity left after Obergefell v. Hodges11-that sexual minorities could, colloquially-speaking, \"be married on a Sunday, and fired on a Monday.\"12 Appropriately then, Bostock exists as an important companion decision alongside other major pro-LGBTQ Supreme Court decisions since Romer v. Evans.13 Referencing that canon, however, we see something is amiss in Bostock. Unlike Obergefell and other prior pro-LGBTQ decisions, Justice Neil Gorsuch' s textualist opinion neglects the lived experiences of discrimination instrumental for developing anti-stereotyping approaches that substantively address anti-queerness and discrimination. By comparison, in the marriage equality cases US. v. Windsor14 and Obergefell, Justice Anthony Kennedy relied on the lived experiences of same-sex couples to develop and animate his animus-dignity anti-stereotyping framework. 15 This anti-stereotyping framework then demonstrated that legal recognition of same-sex marriages would not threaten the established institution of marriage-as traditional stereotypes had envisioned-but rather such exclusion inflicted intense societal stigma upon queer identities. 16 Further, beyond that canon of pro-11. 576 U.S. 644 (2015).12. See e.g., Noam Scheiber, L.G.B.TQ. Rights Ruling Pushes Workplace DynamicAlready in Motion, N.Y. TIMES (June 15, 2020), https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/ business/economy/lgbtq-supreme-court-workforce.html. 13. 517 U.S. 620 (1996).14. 570 U.S. 744 (2013).15. Recent scholarly works have discussed how both same-sex marriage casesestablish anti-stereotyping frameworks. See e.g., Cary Franklin, Marrying Liberty and Equality: The New Jurisprudence of Gay Rights, 100 VA. L. REv. 817, 872-881 (2014) (discussing how cases after Windsor interpreted the decision's as expounding a \"broad anti-stereotyping reasoning\") [hereinafter Franklin, Marrying Liberty and Equality]; Luke A. Boso, Dignity, Inequality, and Stereotypes, 92 WASH. L. REV. 1119, 1137-1140 (2017) (discussing Obergefell's \"equal dignity command\" as an anti-stereotyping approach). In Windsor, Justice Kennedy specifically relies on the effects ofDOMA on married same-sex couples and their families in order to find that disproportionate harms caused by DOMA stems from animus that tarnishes the dignity of married same-sex couples. See Windsor, 570 U.S. at 771-75. Meanwhile, in Obergefell, Justice Kennedy excerpts the lives of the litigating same-sex couples, such as James Obergefell and John Arthur, to help demonstrate the dignitary harms state marriage bans disproportionately inflict. Obergefell, 576 U.S. at 658. 16. Id. at 670. Justice Kennedy notes the states have \"contributed to the fundamental character of the marriage right by placing that institution at the center of so many facets of the legal and social order,\" and that \"[t]here is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to this principle.\" Id. Yet, \"by virtue of their exclusion from that institution, same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the states have linked to marriage. This harm results in more than just material burdens. 2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 287 LGBTQ cases, in the decades since Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 11 Title VII jurisprudence also promoted anti-stereotyping theories helpful for queer minorities-jurisprudence that Bostock could have also relied on and clarified.18 Thus, when Justice Gorsuch writes in Bostock that \"[f]ew factsare needed to appreciate the legal question we face,\" his remark is not necessarily one of inclusion, but of delicate erasure. 19Lived experiences matter in redressing discrimination against queer identities. Anti-stereotyping principles have affected, and ought to continually effect, doctrine in discrimination cases premised on non­heteronormative identities-on aspects of queerness. 2° Contemporarydiscrimination involves complex facets that ought to be explored and understood in context. As this Article will explore, within queer lived experiences, the dominant society has historically authored much of the categorical significances of sexualities and depended on that authorship to marginalize queer identities. 21 Especially when conceptions of sexuality andgender identities have been previously mischaracterized in favor of heteronormative gender roles, 22 and where the culture of marginalization forSame-sex couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives.\" Id. Moreover, Justice Kennedy's observation that \"[f]ar from seeking to devalue marriage, [same-sex couples] seek it for themselves because of their respect ... for its privileges and responsibilities \" and that \"their immutable nature dictates that same-sex marriage is their only real path \" strikes as ways to ameliorate status quo assumptions that same-sex couples would threaten traditional marriage. Id. at 658. 17. 490 U.S. 228 (1989).18. See Ann C. McGinley, Erasing Boundaries: Masculinities, Sexual Minorities,and Employment Discrimination, 43 U. MICH. J.L. REFORM 713, 714 (2010) (\"[ S]exual minorities have made some progress toward protection against employment discrimination by using the Price Waterhouse stereotyping doctrine to advance their cause.\"). 19. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1737.20. See e.g., Franklin, Marrying Liberty and Equality, supra note 15, at 827 (\"Theanti-stereotyping doctrine courts have recently developed in gay rights cases is directly responsive to the history of discrimination gays and lesbians have experienced in the American legal system. Historically, anti-gay stereotypes had a powerful prescriptive component.\"). 21. See e.g., Craig J. Konnoth, Created in Its Image: The Race Analogy, Gay Identity, and Gay Litigation in the 1950s-1970s, 119 YALE L.J. 316, 319-20 (2009) ( describing how during prior segments of the LGBTQ movement, \"[ c ]ourts and politicians ... rel[ied] on traditional psychiatry and religion to identify gays as a group and emphasized the perverse, homosexual identity of these organizations and consequently, \"[g]ays themselves internalized many of these claims.\"). 22. For instance, Russell Robinson and David Frost note that \"[c]ontemporary homophobia turns on a bifurcated conception of sex between men and the public 288 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 many LGBTQ individuals have involved forms of social or cultural invisibility,23 lived experiences of queerness are paramount for detecting discrimination, and also correcting it. Bostock' s failure to highlight the biases and indignities experienced by queer minorities in employment discrimination is not a forgivable oversight collateral to the decision's sweeping textualist interpretation of Title VII sex discrimination; this neglect was the price queer minorities had to pay for Title VII protection. Ultimately, Justice Gorsuch's lack of regard in Bostock for queer lived experiences tacitly privileges heteronormative values, rather than respects queer identities enough to address the underlying gendered stereotyping concerns that animate anti-queer bias. Instead, it underscores the status quo's own interest convergence in Bostock and limits the decision's transformative potential. Moving past this Part I Introduction, Part II will recount the historical misconceptions concerning sexualities, which the heteronormative status quo has engendered into anti-queer stereotyping bias, and have, in tum, marginalized queer identities in society and law. Part III will then illustrate the doctrinal anti-stereotyping tactics developed in canonical Supreme Court gender and sexual orientation discrimination cases that have responded to such biases to advance equality. Part IV will contrast that observation with a critical reading of Bostock that reveals how textualism accomplishes LGBTQ protections in its immediacy, but eventually preserves heteronormativity. And finally, before the Article's close, Part IV will also prescribe why and how future cases can attenuate that preservation by reviving anti-stereotyping considerations that highlight queer lived experiences of discrimination. What queering Bostock reveals is how inevitably un-queer the decision is at all. Bostock is a victory for LGBTQ identities associated with men who engage in that sexual behavior, including gay, bisexual, and queer\" and that \"public aversion to sex between men rests on a cramped understanding of gender.\" Russell K. Robinson & David M. Frost, The Afterlife of Homophobia, 60 Aruz. L. REv. 213, 218, 275 (2018) [hereinafter Robinson & Frost, Afterlife of Homophobia]. In addition, they articulate that for transgender people, \"a central tactic deployed by anti-LGBTQ forces is reimagining transgender women as 'biological males' who, as men, are constructed as a threat to cisgender women.\" This \"misgendering\" accordingly \"stereotypes cisgender women as fragile and uniquely in need of governmental protection from transgender women, and it also reinforces the stereotype that male sex necessarily entails sexual violence.\" Id. at 220-21 (footnotes omitted). 23. See e.g., William N. Eskridge, Jr., Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet: Establishing Conditions for Lesbian and Gay Intimacy, Nomos, and Citizenship, 1961-1981, 25 HOFSTRA L. REV. 817, 819 (1997) (\"Fear of social and familial ostracism kept most homosexuals in the closet. The law sealed that closet shut for most gays and lesbians, while at the same time, outing others in state-sponsored witchhunts.\").  2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 289 individuals, but it is also a decision with serious doctrinal limitations that unavoidably preserves a discriminatory status quo. II. CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF ANTI-QUEER STEREOTYPESA. Modern Historical OriginsBy historians' accounts, contemporary conceptions of non­heteronormative sexual and gender identities take their roots in the nineteenth century.24 John D'Emilio recounts that \"[d]uring the second half of the nineteenth century, the momentous shift to industrial capitalism provided the condition for a homosexual and lesbian identity to emerge.\"25 This history began with the categorization of same-sex sexual behaviors that gradually became merged into an identity-behaviors that, prior to the nineteenth century, infringed upon communal norms or morality and transgressed a certain teleology that prioritized \"the sanctioned bonding of husband and wife.\"26 But prior to the nineteenth century, same-sex intimacy,though often criminalized, was not yet associated with an identity: \"Though criminal records, church sermons, and other evidence reveal homoerotic activity among the residents of the colonies, nothing indicate[ d] that men or women thought of themselves as 'homosexual. \"'27 Others also similarlyhave noted that \"[i]n previous centuries, sexual activity between people of the same gender had been deemed a matter of taste or moral weakness, depending on the time and place.\"28 Though such behavior was punishable, \"there was no sense of homosexuals as a class of people with whom society needed to concern itself.\"29 In part, as D'Emilio surmises, this reality was 24. See e.g., Jonathan Ned Katz, The Invention of Heterosexuality, RACE, CLASS,AND GENDER IN THE UNITED STATES: AN INTEGRATED STUDY 49 (Paulas. Rothenberg & Christina Hsu Accomando eds., 11th ed., 2020) [hereinafter Katz, The Invention of Heterosexuality]. 25. John D'Emilio, Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities: The Making of aHomosexual Minority in the United States 1940-1970 11 (2d ed. 1998) [hereinafter D'EMILIO, SEXUAL POLITICS, SEXUAL COMMUNITIES]. 26. Id. at 10.27. Id. (\"Even trials of persistent offenders document daily lives that revolvedaround a heterosexual family role.\"). 28. Michael Nava & Robert Dawidoff, Created Equal: Why Gay Rights Matter toAmerica 40 (1994). 29. Id. Both Nava and Dawidoffs observations and D'Emilio's account contest theidea other scholars have proposed which asserts that a version of the gay identity pre­dates the modem industrialization era. For instance, John Boswell's study ofreligious and social regard for same-sex attraction in medieval Europe was framed as a study of \"gay people,\" a group that, as he recognized, has \"constituted a substantial minority in 290 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 due to the virtually-unspoken notion that \"'[h]eterosexuality' remained undefined, since it was literally, the only way of life.\"30 The shift toward industrialized capitalism cultivated the conditions for society to be less dependent on procreation for sustaining a communal economy previously based on agriculture, and consequently less reliant on the values that would promote such behavior.31 Individuals migrated to large urban centers and embraced new ways of living and work that encouraged \"a social context in which an autonomous personal life could develop.\"32 Out of a burgeoning capitalist society and a transformative modernity, the conflation between behavior and identity began to take hold through collective self-identification surrounding common same-sex erotic interests distinguishable from mainstream interests: \"In America's cities from the 1870s through the 1930s, there emerged a class of people who recognized their erotic interest in members of their own sex, interpreted this interest as a significant characteristic that distinguished them from the majority, and sought others like themselves.\"33 Such self-actualized group membership included individuals across lines of genders, occupations, race, national origins, and class, and inhabited different geographic spaces that emerged specifically for such group life to flourish.34 By the early twentieth century, the conflation between non-heteronormative sexual behavior and identity manifested into a distinctive group category so that in the early decades \"a subculture of gay men and lesbians was evolving in American cities that would help to create a collective consciousness among its participants and strengthen their sense of identification with a group.\"35 every age.\" John Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century 5 (1980) (footnote omitted). For the purposes of this article, the focus is on contemporary conceptions of non-heteronormative identities that have affected the way we regulate queer identities presently. Thus, I do not intend to resolve or debate the differences between these authors that pertain outside contemporary conceptualizations. 30.

Id. at 12 (\"By 1915, one observer of male homosexual life was already referring2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 291 In tandem with capitalism and industrialization, historical accounts have also traced the classification of non-heteronormative sexual identities -including one famously offered by Michel Foucault-to the medicalization of sexuality during the latter part of the nineteenth century. 36 According to Jonathan Ned Katz, the medical profession's ascendancy during the nineteenth century also contributed to normative perspectives on human sexuality: \"Medical men, in the name of science, defined a new ideal of male­female relationships that included, in women as well as men, an essential, necessary, normal eroticism.\"37 Such \"normal eroticism\" would standardize and consequently distinguish itself from types of deviant and unacceptable states of sexual being.38 In fact, as D'Emilio also puts it, \"[d]octors to it as 'a community distinctly organized.'\") ( quoting Jonathan Ned Katz, Gay American History 52 (1992)). 36. See e.g. Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality, Volume 1: An Introduction 43 (1978) (\"We must not forget that the psychological, psychiatric, medical category of homosexuality was constituted from the moment it was characterized-Westphal' s famous article of 1870 on the 'contrary sexual sensations' can stand as its date ofbirth­less by a type of sexual relations than by a certain quality of sexual sensibility, a certain way of inverting the masculine and the feminine in oneself. Homosexuality appeared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.\") 37. Katz, The Invention of Heterosexuality, supra note 24, at 50. Recently, in a posthumous work, the late queer literary scholar, Sam See has daringly queered the supremacy of this normal eroticism assumption through a re-examination of Charles Darwin's work. Specifically, See notes that Darwin's observations of nature and natural selection have been misunderstood and surprisingly encompass queer readings of nature: \"[Q]ueer features surprisingly undergrid some of the most far-reaching claims that Darwin makes about biological life.\" Sam See, Charles Darwin, Queer Theorist in QUEER NATURES, QUEER MYTHOLOGIES 25 {Christopher Looby & Michael North eds., 2020). In this way, See asserts that \"[t]he most precise-yet still tentative ('appears')--­origin of not only the human species but the 'whole vertebrate kingdom' is thus a queer body that defies naturalized definitions of sex.\" Id. From here, See reads Darwin as \"posit[ing] in other words, that humans comprise a queer species whose ostensibly nonadaptational traits exemplify rather than are exempt from the species' rule.\" Id. Likely, See's critical implication here is that essentialized readings of sexuality, biology, and nature are also constructions. 38. Katz, The Invention of Heterosexuality, supra note 24, at 50. As Katz describes, \"[b ]y the 1880s, the rise of doctors as a professional group fostered the rise of a new medical model of Normal Love, replete with sexuality. The new Normal Woman and Man were endowed with a healthy libido.\" Id. The categorization of what type of sexuality or eroticism was normal-an opposite-sex version-was promulgated as \"a new sexual ethic as if it were a morally neutral, medication description of health.\" Id. Furthermore, this normal state of sexual being had its counterparts in deviancy: \"The creation of the new Normal Sexual had its counterpart in the invention of the late 292 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 developed theories about homosexuality, describing it as a condition, something that was inherent in a person, a part of his or her 'nature,\"' and eventually such interpretations of same-sex attraction became so prevalent that it became a feature for self-identification.39 Once these conflations took better hold in the mainstream in the early twentieth century, decisions by the dominant status quo to privilege those who exhibited \"normal eroticism\" became easier to manipulate.40 Such privileging led to heterosupremacy: \"The idea of heterosexuality as the master sex from which all others deviated was (like the idea of the master race) deeply authoritarian. The doctor's normalization of a sex that was hetero proclaimed a new heterosexual separatism-an erotic apartheid that forcefully segregated the sex normal from the sex perverts.\"41 In this vein, once same-sex attraction became consistently indicative of a non-heteronormative identity-a so-called \"homosexual\" identity-and was deemed to threaten normalized heterosexuality, the idea of homosexuality as an identity helped privilege certain groups of people over others, as a kind of\"sexual hegemony.\"42 This privileging paralleled how the dominant status quo similarly oppressed other marginal groups, such as those based on race and gender lines.43 From Victorian Sexual Pervert. The attention paid the sexual abnormal created a need to name the sexual normal, the better to distinguish the average him and her from the deviant it.\" Id. 39.

Serena Mayeri, \"A Common Fate of Discrimination\": Race-Gender Analogies in Legal and Historical Perspective, 110 YALE L.J. 1045, 1057 (2001). Serena Mayeri's study extensively draws the similarities between racial and gender oppression identified by social scientists who noted \"that both women and Negroes occupied a 'caste-like' status, exhibiting tendencies toward self-hatred, an internalization of the inferiority attributed to them by the dominant society\" as a result of dominant status quo's \"similar[ly] ascribed attributes including intellectual inferiority, emotional volatility, and lack of sexual self-control; confinement to low social status and mythologized \"contentment\"; strategies of accommodation such as a deferential manner, pretension of 2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 293 making distinctions based on sexual identities, the heteronormative status quo rationalized conferring degrees of legal protections to those who would not disturb its dominant values.44 Often the rationale for denying protections to non-heteronormative identities arose by imbuing these sexual identities with hyper-menacing notions of deviance, degeneracy, or pathology.45 Indeed, the establishment \"marked gay people as inferior-less moral, less respectable, and less healthy than their fellows.\"46 Just within medicine, the pathological characterization of non-heteronormative sexual identities was a complex debate framed by the mainstream medical community's fin-de­siecle sexology, which stoked in the status quo a panic that paralleled existing status quo fears of relinquishing racial purity from African­Americans and immigrants.47 Various medical theories of pathology, many ignorance, and methods of 'outwitting' the dominant group; and finally, educational, economic, professional, and social discriminations that resulted in lower occupational attainments.\" Id.

Likewise, Craig Konnoth observes that this analogy to racial and gender oppression is precisely how the sexual minorities later followed the paths of racial and gender minority groups in advocating for advancements and protections. Konnoth, supra note 21, at 341. 44. As historian Craig Rimmerman intimates, the assimilationist strategies of theearly gay and lesbian activist group, the Mattachine Society, reflected the awareness of these distinctions. Craig A. Rimmerman, From Identity to Politics: The Gay and Lesbian Movements in the United States 22 (2002).

Anti-Queer Stereotyping Effects in Law295 Within the law, D'Emilio observes that \"[t]he severity with which legislatures and magistrates viewed homosexual behavior, moreover, buttressed the enforcement of a wide range of other penal code provisions against homosexuals and lesbians.\"55 Moving from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, the mainstream medical characterization of pathology influenced legal characterizations, prompting legislatures to refer to psychiatrists when promulgating \"sexual psychopath laws that officially recognized homosexuality as a socially threatening disease. \"56 Such laws became one of the various ways to justify disqualifying sexual minorities from legal recognition-for instance, in immigration cases. 57 But the hatred and stigmatization were not merely in statutes and enforcement. One incidental account of a court proceeding in 1951 by a New York City magistrate \"described how the court attendant's 'normally stentorian voice drop[ped] to a whisper' when reading a homosexual-related complaint, while judges commonly directed gratuitous, abusive language at defendants.\"58 Evidently, \"[ c ]ourt proceedings seemed designed to instill feelings of shame and obliterate self-esteem.\"59 Just as society was unsympathetic to queer minorities, aspects oflaw practice were also unsympathetic. Moreover, courts' historical reliance on stereotyping has also prominently justified disqualifying queer individuals from substantive legal protections.60 Status quo connotations that attached to non-heteronormative identities, 54. In part, D'Emilio points to this invisibility in the first half of the twentiethcentury: \"Prudence dictated that they remain unobtrusive and leave behind as little incriminating evidence as possible.\" D'EMILIO, SEXUAL POLITICS, SEXUAL COMMUNITIES, supra note 25, at 20.

A century after the conflation of identity and non-heteronormative sexual behavior, the Supreme Court's 1986 decision, Bowers v. Hardwick,62 illustrates the product of such stereotyping. The Bowers Court's focus on respondent Michael Hardwick's identity as a \"practicing homosexual\" significantly invigorated Justice Bryon White's rationale against constitutionally protecting Hardwick for engaging in an act of consensual same-sex intimacy that triggered Georgia's sodomy statute.63 The case illustrates how identity was punished in addition to conduct that threatened mainstream norms. Bowers involved Hardwick's violation of a sodomy statute that did not specifically define and forbid such acts based on the perpetrator's sexual identity; indeed, the statute was identity-neutral.64 In fact, an early footnote in Justice White's opinion described an opposite sex couple-\"John and Mary Doe\"-who had joined Hardwick to challenge the suit, but were dismissed for lack of standing as they had only \"alleged that they wished to engage in sexual activity proscribed by [the Georgia statute] in the privacy of their home\"; they had not actually been caught and prosecuted for engaging in such activity.65 Justice White did not raise the applicability of Georgia law on opposite-sex couples that would presumably, 61.

Id. at 188. In a sentence that seems to emphasize Hardwick's own self­identification, Justice White writes: \"[Hardwick] asserted that he was a practicing homosexual, that the Georgia sodomy statute, as administered by the defendants, placed him in imminent danger of arrest, and that the statute for several reasons violates the Federal Constitution.\" Id.; see also Levit, A Different Kind of Sameness, supra note 2, at 895 (\"This was the definitional logic of the Court in Bowers v. Hardwick, when it upheld Georgia's right to criminalize sodomy, implicitly assuming either that sodomy was exclusively a homosexual practice or that homosexual sodomy was exclusively criminalized.\") (footnote omitted). 64. The Georgia statute only provided that \"[a] person commits the offense ofsodomy when he performs or submits to any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another.\" Ga Code Ann. §16-6-2(a) (1984). 65.

In fact, the Court ignored it. By characterizing Hardwick's conduct as a homosexual version of sodomy, Justice White carved distance between Hardwick's case and prior Supreme Court decisions that had guaranteed constitutional privacy interests 66. See id. (\"We express no opinion on the constitutionality of the Georgia statute asapplied to other acts of sodomy.\"). 67. Id.

We see a similar marshalling of facts later in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, 138 S.

Those cases involved sexual activities that existed in a heteronormative world, which would presumably involve stereotypically heterosexual decisions regarding \"child rearing and education,\" \"family relationships,\" \"procreation,\" \"contraception,\" and \"abortion.\"71 Accordingly, under that logic, the Court \"[thought] it evident that none of the rights announced in those cases bears any resemblance to the claimed constitutional right of homosexuals to engage in acts of sodomy that is asserted in this case. No connection between family, marriage, or procreation on the one hand and homosexual activity on the other has been demonstrated[.]\"72 Justice White relied on the traditionof criminalizing sodomy to overshadow the lived experiences of persecution: \"Proscriptions against [homosexuals to engage in acts of consensual sodomy] have ancient roots. \"73 He cited the history of sodomy laws to deem any claim for a fundamental right to homosexual sodomy \"at best, facetious.\"74 Consequently, the Bowers Court assigned heteronormative moral value-judgments upon the lived experiences of sexual minorities, rather than deeply exploring lived experiences to illuminate the inherent discrimination and marginalization that sodomy statutes had on queer identities. 75 In recent decades, scholars have pointed out that sexual identities embody pluralism-one that often destabilizes the characterizations set up by the dominant mainstream regarding non-heteronormative sexual and gender identities and is influenced by the lived experiences of LGBTQ individuals. 76 Bowers is an example of traditional notions of who receives 71.

The law, however, is constantly based on notions of morality, and if all laws representing essentially moral choices are to be invalided under the Due Process Clause, the courts will be very busy indeed.

Other cases had also denied recognition based on the same definitional grounds that LGBTQ individuals were summarily not a protected group--for instance, Baker v. Nelson.77 Here, Bowers accomplished this denial by singling out homosexuals within an identity-neutral statute under Georgia law and disenfranchising them over their sexual activities, while remaining silent about the law's application to heterosexuals and their sexual activities. But because the Bowers Court relied on assumptions of status quo stereotypes without even articulating them in the opinion, it illustrates the power of stereotypes for obscuring the lived experiences of queer individuals. As Anthony Michael Kreis notes, Bowers' resistance to regarding consensual same-sex intimacy positively might have involved generalized anxieties that challenged heteronormative gender roles, particular roles that are underscored in traditional opposite-sex marnages: The danger in recognizing that sexual intimacy between two men or two women might serve a similar purpose as a marriage exposed two problems for the supremacy of masculinity-it challenged marital-related sex stereotypes and tapped into the fears that cropped up nearly a century prior that sex and gender roles were not innate and fixed.78Moral judgments placed on non-heteronormative sexual activities in Bowersexaggerated differences as a means for categorizing, marginalizing, and eventually discriminating against LGBTQ individuals. Hardwick's conduct was aberrant because the majority refused to recognize symbolic similarities to heteronormative procreative sex acts in ways that allowed prior constitutional precedents to protect those acts. 79 What differentiated Hardwick's sex was his sexual identity as a \"practicing homosexual.\"80 Infused with the connotations of his sexual identity, his conduct appeared destabilizing to the heteronormative status quo, which prompted the Court's reproach from a traditional and \"presumed\" moral vantage point.81 United States, 24 ETHNIC & RACIAL STUD. 531 (2001)). 77.

Toward the end of the twentieth century, stereotypes that identified queer individuals based on non-heteronormative behavior were weaponized to keep such individuals from inclusion within mainstream society. That differentiation appears in Bowers as one memorable example in law of the Court's dependency on entrenched anti-queer stereotypes. However, with the post-Second World War rise in queer politics and activism, particularly \"in the decades since the birth of the mass gay and lesbian rights movements following the Stonewall Riots, queer activism began to challenging the prevailing stereotypes. \"84 Queer visibility had emerged during this time especially in part due to the AIDS crisis, but also as a result of the overall civil rights movement. 85 Once marriage became a vigorously pursued issue, sameness arguments were being articulated to into one aspect of the human personality, the manner in which homosexuals physically express sexual love\" and consequently \"chose a construction of gay and lesbian social identity that marginalizes the humanity of a minority group\"). 82.

See generally Pauli Murray, The Negro Woman's Stake in the Equal Rights Amendment, 6 HARV. C.R.-C.L. L. REv. 253 (1971). The white status quo also can rely on stereotypes to manipulate integration of outsider racial groups that still results in inter- and intra­group oppression. See e.g., Ellen D.

Finally, the intersectional identities complicate what dominant stereotypes can do.

REv. 251, 274 (2002) (noting that \"while privileged white women while privileged white women struggle against stereotypes that suggest they are vulnerable, asexual, and naturally suited to nurturing, many African American women resist stereotyping as strong, promiscuous, and irresponsible mothers\") (footnote omitted)). 105.

Nor was it strictly anti-subordinationist: Because discrimination against women had traditionally been viewed as a benefit to them, Ginsburg was concerned that an anti-subordination principle would provide courts with too little guidance about which forms of regulation warrant constitutional concern.

Hopkins. 124 Again, anti-stereotyping principles confronted gender role stereotyping here. Accounting firm, Price Waterhouse, had hesitated to promote a woman candidate, Ann Hopkins, to partnership status because of stereotypical perceptions related to her gender: One partner described her as 'macho'; another suggested that she 'overcompensated for being a woman'; a third advised her to take 'a course at charm school.' Several partners criticized her use of profanity; in response, one partner suggested that those partners objected to her swearing only 'because it's a lady using foul language.' Another supporter explained that Hopkins 'ha[d] matured from a tough-talking somewhat masculine hard-nosed [manager] to an authoritative, formidable, but much more appealing lady [partner] candidate.'125 According to Justice Brennan, who authored the plurality opinion, the \"coup de grace\" comment recommended that \"Hopkins should 'walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, survivor benefits for widows without regard to their dependency on their husbands and provided similar benefits for widowers only once the latter could prove their financial dependency on their wives.

Central to animating the bias in the minds of Price Waterhouse's reviewing partners was the conflation between sex and gender performance-a moral judgment, revealed in the expectations against Hopkins' behavior. The Court's gender stereotyping theory in Price Waterhouse disaggregates sex and behavior to direct attention to the reality of Hopkins' experience at the firm-that her failure to conduct herself in a manner stereotypically expected of a woman in a management position was the inappropriate focus of her promotion review, not her actual merits or accomplishments at the firm.137 133.

But the post-decisional trajectory for Price Waterhouse's gender stereotyping theory has not been as innovative; in fact, in treatment by subsequent litigants, Kramer describes the theory as a \"mixed blessing.\" 139 In part, the trajectory might have been stunted by unresolved debates over the theory as either a transformative innovation for sex discrimination or merely a suspect strategy.140 Also, interpretative nuances amongst legal scholars over how to define Price Waterhouse's gender stereotyping theory has taken place, for instance, between Mary Anne Case's \"thin view of sex\" or \"trait neutrality\" approach and Kimberly Yuracko's approach that takes into account historical structural inequalities to applying Price Waterhouse. 141 138.

How courts define \"sex\" can curtail the theory's reach: \"[S]ex-stereotyping theory and arguments are typically anchored to binary 'biological' sex as a simplistic stand-in for the sex trait.\"142 Though Lin observes some deviations here, \"[ c ]urrent articulations of stereotyping theory tend to constrain readings of sex that acknowledge further sexual variation.\"143 Furthermore, the disaggregation between sex and gender originally in Price Waterhouse has taken on patriarchal status quo nuances: \"After Price Waterhouse, courts interpreted Title VII to reach both 'sex' as physical differences between only men and women, and 'gender' as cultural attributes self-determined or ascribed by others. Most judges and parties frame statutory 'sex' as a binary 'biological' classification that preserves the practice.\"144 As a result, the aggregate of such readings creates the conundrum of the status quo regulating the adjudication of its own stereotypes in these discrimination cases-and unfortunately, getting the frameworks wrong. Cases incorrectly suppose that \"sex stereotyping and the binary are necessarily linked and leaves intact normative barriers for those who identify with communities that include intersex, non-binary, agender, and gender-fluid, and renders less deliberative the important dialogic relationships between legal institutions and society, including social justice movements that advocate for politically vulnerable communities.\"145 In Lin's view, the cabining of \"sex\" and \"gender\" to status quo conventions in developing gender stereotyping theories after Price Waterhouse illustrates how \"[l]egal theories that do not reflect lived experience reinstate and legitimize dominant views of sex and gender, and allow institutions to persist in expressive harms against minorities.\"146 Consequently, much development is still needed.

Prior to Bostock, this disaggregation led to regarding sex as a protective trait separately from sexual orientation. 150 In these cases, courts kept LGBTQ workers from using Price Waterhouse gender-stereotyping to remedy sexual orientation employment discrimination cases under Title VII by claiming that by doing so, these claimants would \"bootstrap\" their way into a sex discrimination claim when sexual orientation had not-until perhaps with Bostock-been recognized as a Title VII protected category. Of course, this interpretative gesture questions who gets to author the disaggregation between sex and sexual orientation identity categories and recalls Lin's thoughts regarding the status quo' s imprimatur over how \"sex\" and \"gender\" distinctions in gender-stereotyping cases have been framed.

But Kramer's \"mixed blessings\" remark applies here as well. Though more successful than plaintiffs suing under sexual orientation discrimination, transgender plaintiffs here had to play by dominant distinctions of \"sex\" and \"gender\" to make successful claims that stereotyping resulted in discrimination. 152 Applying gender stereotyping, trans gender plaintiffs exchange recovery for having their narratives obscured in court. For instance, as Kramer, Lin and others have pointed out in their readings of Smith v. City of Salem, 153 a case where a male-to-female transgender firefighter claimed sex discrimination under Title VII after she was suspended from her job when she started appearing as a woman at work, 154 the use of gender-stereotyping was successful but also restricted the plaintiff's ability to articulate her lived experience.155 Despite identifying as female at her work, the plaintiff had to assert a male identity in court to access a gender stereotyping theory - basically arguing that she was a man who wanted to assert a female identity.156 In this fashion, the Sixth Circuit's gender-stereotyping rationale \"effectively erases transgenderism as an identity.\"157 Lin observes that \"[m]ost judges and parties frame statutory 'sex' as a binary 'biological' classification that preserves the practice.

Of course, the doctrinal successes and failures of queer minorities using Price Waterhouse to address sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination under Title VII had created circuit splits in federal courts prior to Bostock. \"Bootstrapping\" concerns may have evanesced after Bostock, where Justice Gorsuch's textualist majority functionally merges the categories of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation together.159 However, anti-stereotyping theories from Price Waterhouse and its progeny likely live to address discriminatory behavior premised on gender roles in the modem workplace, and hopefully apply to queer minorities. Given the various interpretative circuit splits over gender-stereotyping as it applies to both sex discrimination and discrimination against queer minorities prior to Bostock, it would be efficacious to continue developing this doctrinal area of anti-discrimination.160 B.

This broad protection would reject a rigid and unequal binary understanding of gender, and would embrace the myriad ways in which gender identity is experienced, defined, and, ultimately, expressed. Tying together the plurality of gender identity and the manner in which that identity is expressed does not result in a wholesale rejection of current Title VII jurisprudence. In fact, tying these ideas together is consistent with the gender stereotyping jurisprudence that the courts have developed in the context of Title VII following Price Waterhouse.\") (footnotes omitted). 161.

Laws and policies that banned same-sex intimacy, barred gays and lesbians from the military, and excluded them from certain jobs all sought to enforce traditional, normative conceptions of sexuality and gender.

Specific to the legal advancements of LGBTQ movements, the Court's recognition of lived experiences has been substantively effective for creating doctrinal justifications that overcome discrimination for queer minorities, where historically membership status based on group traits did not avail any affirmative protections. 163 The eventual development of a distinctive anti-stereotyping theory in the Supreme Court's major pro-LGBTQ cases began a decade within Bowers' shadow, with Romer v. Evans. 164 Unlike gender discrimination cases, anti-stereotyping approaches here try to lessen the threat anti-queer stereotypes posed to the heteronormative status quo in order to engender anti-discrimination protections. As we will discover, the anti-stereotyping approaches here highlight the lived experiences of queer minorities to a certain extent. Such approaches, however, also have limitations that beckon further development. 1. Animus in RomerThe earliest major examples of anti-stereotyping in the Court's pro­LGBTQ cases appear in Romer and Lawrence v. Texas, where concepts about animus and dignity in LGBTQ discrimination were used respectively. With animus, Justice Kennedy placed this concept in his Romer majority opinion to justify overturning a publicly-voted amendment to Colorado's state constitution that repealed municipal ordinance protections of individuals based on their sexual orientation. 165 Through the use of animus, Justice Kennedy would show that Amendment 2 created a \"license to discriminate\" 166 against sexual minorities that was designed and shaped by gays and lesbians was often justified on the ground that this model of the family was superior to all others, and that the law ought to encourage all Americans to assimilate into it.\"). 162.

These are protections taken for granted by most people either because they already have them or do not need them; these are protections against exclusion from an almost limitless number of transactions and endeavors that constitute ordinary civic life in a free society.175 To further apply this dissection of the \"special rights\" rhetoric to LGBTQ individuals in Romer and beyond, the denial of basic rights that enable participation in American society eclipses the lived experiences of LGBTQ individuals more so than other minorities because of the historic characteristics of marginalization specific to non-heteronormative attention are unusual demands.\"). 173. Amendment 2 proponents, Colorado for Family Values, distributed campaignliterature that warns \"about the danger [the militant gay agenda's] goals represent to you and your children's rights\" and describes \"the gay lifestyle has nothing in common with the kinds of traits and behaviors America has protected in its civil rights laws\" and \"it isn't kind of behavior society needs to reward with special class status.\" See Robert F. Nagel, Playing Defense, 6 WM. & MARY BILL RTS. J. 167, 194 (1997) (excerpting Colorado for Family Values' campaign literature). Then the proponents used a public group sex scenario involving three men that they claimed was protected by a California anti-discrimination ordinance in order to justify that \"special, protected civil rights are reserved for legitimate ethnic minorities who are truly disadvantaged.\" Id. Others have also noted that Amendment 2 proponents also used \"gay as privileged\" stereotypes, \"portray[ing] gays and lesbians as wealthy, well-educated, and politically powerful\" as another way to deploy the worthiness argument under special rights.

Nancy Levit observes similarly that the \"special rights\" rhetoric \"diverts attention from human conditions\" and is one of the devices of intolerance that requires dispelling in order to engender more visibility and \"replac[ e] the dominant cultural images with more accurate portrayals of the lived experiences oflesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transsexuals.\"176 Doctrinally in Romer, Justice Kennedy responded to Amendment 2 and the \"special rights\" justification by undermining the amendment's wide­ranging breadth. Within an equal protection framework, Justice Kennedy relies on animus to acknowledge the unprotected status of sexual minorities, but also to enshrine protections for them against Amendment 2's spurious deprivation of basic rights. Amendment 2 \"has the peculiar property of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group\" because \"[i]t identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protections across the board.\"177 From there, \"its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.\"178 Quoting Department ofAgriculture v. Moreno179 in part, Justice Kennedy articulated that \"laws of the kind now before us raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected\" and that such a '\"desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest. \"'180 Moreover, Justice Kennedyacknowledged how the animus-driven amendment to Colorado's constitution \"inflicts on [ sexual minorities] immediate, continuing, and real injuries that outrun and belie any legitimate justifications[.]\"181 Such observations of LGBTQ discrimination are ones he later imported and extended in Lawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell.

'naked preferences\"' and that \"the Constitution demands that every law serve a public-regarding interest or objective or, at a minimum, that it at least be intended to do so.\"19° Cass Sunstein explains how government conduct can be restricted because of naked preferences, \"if, for example, the government were barred from relying on disfavored stereotypes of women or members of minority groups, on the ground that reliance on such stereotypes is illegitimate and ought to be excluded from the category of public values.\"191 As viewed here by Justice Kennedy, that animus behind Amendment 2 appears as none other than a naked preference: \"It is a status-based enactment divorced from any factual context from which we could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests; it is a classification of persons undertaken for its own sake, something the Equal Protection Clause does not permit.\"192 In this way, though not in any thorough or explicit detail, Romer initiated the anti­stereotyping framework in Supreme Court LGBTQ rights cases. The Court's \"rejection of Colorado for Family Values' political handiwork was a tentative first step toward the conclusion that equal protection bars state action that reflects or reinforces stereotyped conceptions of gays and lesbians as a threat to one's 'grandkids.\"'193 The start was restrained but notable. Despite constitutional constraints on protecting sexual minorities at the time, the Romer Court was, nonetheless, able to provide a limited protection. Animus as the anti-stereotyping concept was the mediator between Romer' s constraints and its goals. 2. Dignity in LawrenceIn Lawrence v. Texas, 194 the Court's next major pro-LGBTQ ruling, theconcept of dignity emerged as another anti-stereotyping device. Compared to Romer and its animus jurisprudence, Lawrence's dignity-based anti­stereotyping doctrine stimulated a more robust-though not flawless­examination of the lived experiences of LGBTQ individuals in overturning Bowers.

But these stereotypes actually represent more than mere hatred toward sexual minorities. As the National Organization for Women's amicus brief supporting Lawrence and Gamer pointed out, sodomy laws-including Texas' here---used stereotypes against non­heteronormative sex to reinforce heteronormative gender roles between men and women, while cementing the biased conflation between identity status and conduct in sexual minorities: \"Texas's prohibition of same-sex intimacy prescribes a gendered standard of sexual behavior and proscribes deviation therefrom: men must not do what women are expected to do ( engage in sexual intimacy with men), and women must not do what men are expected to do (engage in sexual intimacy with women).\"199 Hence, Justice Kennedy's attempts to overturn Bowers would become more consequential by using an anti-stereotyping tactic to unveil these sodomy law's underlying subtexts. 195.

Moral connotations had allowed the Bowers Court to conflate Hardwick's conduct with his identity, impugn his character, and justify his non-protection.200 Instead, Justice Kennedy focused on elevating any latent constitutional interests in consensual same­sex intimacy-revisiting the privacy and autonomy protections that Justices Blackmun and Stevens had found in their respective Bowers dissents.201 Here, Justice Kennedy connected sexual conduct in Lawrence to conduct protected by Griswold v. Connecticut,202 Eisenstadt v. Baird,203 Roe v.Wade,204 and Carey v. Population Services lnternational.205 This connectiondepended on seeing how all of these cases invoked constitutional privacy and autonomy interests, and that such protections reached beyond protecting merely married adults.206 Where Bowers had stereotypically misjudged consensual same-sex intimacy as immoral, Justice Kennedy recast the conduct just far enough to distance it from heteronormative values weighted toward procreative and reproductive sex choices; instead, he examined why consensual same-sex intimacy shares similarity to conduct protected by reproductive rights cases. For instance, when Justice Kennedy criticizes the Bowers Court's distinctions between heteronormative sex and non­heteronormative sex in presenting the issue in Bowers as whether there is \"a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy,\" he is raising 200. See Bowers, 478 U.S. at 192, 196 (\"It is obvious to us that neither of theseformulations would extend a fundamental right to homosexuals to engage in acts of consensual sodomy.

After all, state sodomy statutes carried invasive penalties that pried at the sexual choices of LGBTQ individuals and were why Kennedy found that they interfered on the level of Griswold, Eisenstadt, Roe, and Carey: \"[Sodomy] statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.\"208 As a result, Justice Kennedy's humanizing here led him to justify curbing regulation of same­sex intimacy, allowing consenting adult individuals to \"choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.\"209 Justice Kennedy reached that conclusion after referencing the lived experiences Bowers had stereotypically mischaracterized: \"When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.\"210 This humanized characterization of consensual intimacy applied to sexual conduct between same-sex partners, and contrasted significantly from the heteronormative panic around consensual sex between men.211 In this fashion, broad references to humanity propelled Lawrence's anti-stereotyping goal and effect. Complimentary to Lawrence's use of dignity, Justice Kennedy also recounted a complex history of contemporary sexuality that both revealed the heteronormative values behind state regulation of sodomy and the status quo conflation of conduct and identity that constructed the \"homosexual identity.\"212 As another use of the lived experience to anti-stereotyping effect, Justice Kennedy demonstrated regulation of non-procreative sex acts was used originally to reinforce heteronormative values213 and the status 207.

But such values, even if they might be embodied by religious beliefs and morality,216 do not inform the regulation of private consensual sex acts; instead, constitutional values do.217 Justice Kennedy's attempt to establish and apply anti-stereotyping principles in Lawrence had some blind spots as well. Mostly, the blindness existed in the way Lawrence generalized the lived experiences of sexual minorities in ways that equate such experiences as being on par with experiences of the heteronormative status quo. An appeal to resemblance can reach for common humanity but also overstate similarities to a point where that appeal obscures crucial realities or differences.218 By true accounts, Lawrence and Gamer were engaging in a sexual encounter that prompted their arrest and later conviction, but they were not in a relationship does not suggest approval of homosexual conduct.[ ... ] It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons.\"). 214.

Hardwick, that the two should be treated as fundamentally different because historically they were. \"223 Coupled with what Spindelman refers to as the \"like straight\" idea propagated by advocates in Lawrence, the Court seemed to have been led by such persuasion to be able to examine the privacy and reproductive rights cases, where the Bowers Court had refused.224 The positive result was Justice Kennedy's 219.

In fact, \"[t]he person with whom Garner had had an enduring personal bond was the man who on a false accusation of weapons violations sent the police into Lawrence's apartment where Lawrence and Garner were having anal sex and who had earlier been granted a temporary restraining order against Garner based on charges of sexual battery in their enduring personal relationship.\" ( citing Bruce Nichols, \"We Never Chose to be Public Figures\": Houston Men Were Surrounded by Secrecy Throughout Appeal, DALLAS MORNING NEWS, June 27, 2003, at 19A). 220.

This likening of queer minorities with heteronormativity confounded Lawrence's conception of dignity with aspects of respectability as well.

Anti-Stereotyping in Windsor & ObergefellWith the marriage equality cases, Justice Kennedy furthered the anti­stereotyping concepts from Romer and Lawrence by deliberately tying them together-first, in Windsor and then finally in Obergefell. In doing so, Justice Kennedy ultimately evinced how exclusions of same-sex relationships from legal recognition in marriage were motived by the status quo's stereotypical animus against same-sex couples who aspired to marry, and, in turn, the same exclusions impinged on the dignities of these same­sex couples. Starting with Windsor's examination of the Defense of Marriage Act,230 Justice Kennedy began to fuse animus and dignity concepts to increase their anti-stereotyping potential while mediating toward the equal protections of same-sex couples in state marriages on the federal level, which DOMA deprived, and maintaining the boundaries of protected categories from expanding to envelope sexual minorities as suspect or quasi-suspect classes. Stereotypes depicting how same-sex couples disrupted the institution of marriage have plagued LGBTQ movements since same-sex couples started actively questioning their exclusion from marriage.231 Often, status quo arguments against including same-sex couples have harped on exaggerated differences from opposite-sex relationships that were rooted in a preference for maintaining heteronormative gender roles over recognizing relationships that bear no necessary relation to domestic space, to kinship, to the couple form, to property, or to the nation.\" In this regard, the opinion's implications are at once modest and quite broad in scope. The legal program that is most easily suggested by Lawrence is one undertaken by adult gay couples who seek recognition for their relationships and whose sexuality is not merely backgrounded, but closeted behind the closed doors of the bedroom. This is a project devoted to celebrating our relationships; it is not a project of sexual rights or the politics of sexuality. Indeed, against this framing of the \"gay agenda,\" the heterosexual reproductive rights cases start looking pretty dam radical. In this sense, overreliance on Lawrence risks domesticating rights, sex, and politics, and charting us down a path of domestic normative sexual citizenship. The political subjects it predetermines are husbands and wives, and the legal projects it maps out do not extend beyond gay marriage.

After a raucous period of marriage litigation and politics in the 1990s that involved cases such as Baehr v. Lewin234 and the rise of civil unions and partnerships,235 several notable states had begun adopting same­sex marriages in the 2000s.236 Despite setbacks, such as California's Proposition 8, the national debate over same-sex marriages was shifting positively in the 2010s.237 Justice Kennedy's anti-stereotyping jurisprudence 232. For instance, Eskridge contends that same-sex marriage opponents maintainedprocreative and religious reasonings for exclusions. See WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE, JR., THE CASE FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: FROM SEXUAL LIBERTY TO CIVILIZED COMMITMENT 96-99 (1996).233. In the litigation over California's Proposition 8, the Ninth Circuit in Perry v.Brown mentioned the various campaign advertisements from opponents of same-sex marriages: Television and print advertisements \"focused on . . .  the concern that people of faith and religious groups would somehow be harmed by the recognition of gay marriage\" and \"conveyed a message that gay people and relationships are inferior, that homosexuality is undesirable and that children need to be protected from exposure to gay people and their relationships.\" These messages were not crafted accidentally. The strategists responsible for the campaign in favor of Proposition 8 later explained their approach: '\"[T]here were limits to the degree of tolerance Californians would afford the gay community. They would entertain allowing gay marriage, but not if doing so had significant implications for the rest of society,\"' such as what children would be taught in school. Perry v.

Perry, 570 U.S. 693 (2013), in which same-sex couples from California challenged the constitutionality of Proposition 8. 570 U.S. 693, 702 (2013). Proposition 8 was a state ballot initiative that had amended the California state constitution, limiting marriages to only opposite-sex couples. Id. at 701.

First, he resuscitated and reframed Lawrence's dignity concepts, observing how \"the State's decision to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import.\"239 Instead of exactly importing Lawrence's conception of dignity, Justice Kennedy deviated from it in Windsor. Rather than warranting inherent respect for a person's identity and autonomy, 240 dignity in Windsor was more about beingdignified-about obtaining dignity through the respectability that marriage Is a Serious Problem, GALLUP (Dec. 6, 2012), http://www.gallup.com/poll/159113 /most-say-gay-lesbian-bias-serious-problem.aspx (relating that sixty-three percent of Americans now believe discrimination against gays and lesbians to be a \"very\" or \"somewhat\" serious problem).

Neil Siegel summarizes the potential narrowness of Windsor's marriage equalityissue: Reading Windsor as a case about extraordinary evidence of congressional animus--extraordinary because of the nature of the evidence (federal overreach) used to infer the presence of animus-limits the Court's reasoning to federal legislation that restricts marriage to opposite-sex couples. So understood, the Court's ruling either has no implications for the constitutionality of state prohibitions on same-sex marriage, or else it implies the validity of such prohibitions. If the state is the relevant constitutional subject, then perhaps it may choose to deny dignity, just as it may choose to confer it. Or perhaps it may act upon an understanding of dignity that is different from the prevailing conception in states that permit same-sex marriage. Neil S.

In Windsor, the women appeared and behaved like many couples in long-term committed marriages, who travel together, are concerned for each other's health, and expect to inherit each other's estates. 245 Even if others have later observed the identity construction at play as the opinion excerpted only the domestic and sanitized portions of their relationship,246 these recited factual details were, nonetheless, conspicuously reminiscent of prominent parts of traditional wedding vows­where couples promise each other in marriage \"to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.\"247 Together, these descriptions depicted such a domestic, conventional \"married\" life that when we learn of Windsor's hefty inheritance tax problem, that tax forfeiture became the outlier that eventually ignited the discussion about discrimination and led to dignity considerations. 248 And while certain states had begun to dignify same-sex 241.

Beyond dignity concepts, Windsor also significantly built on prior anti­stereotyping jurisprudence by focusing on animus, which Justice Kennedy ascribed as the source of DOMA 's indignity effect. From Romer, Justice Kennedy revived his use of Moreno's concept of a \"bare congressional desire to harm\" and applied it here to DOMA: DOMA's unusual deviation from the usual tradition ofrecognizing and accepting state definitions of marriage here operates to deprive same-sex couples of the benefits and responsibilities that come with the federal recognition of their marriages. This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of that class. The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States.250 Legislative history uncovered such bare desire to harm, showing how the House of Representatives \"concluded that DOMA expresses 'both moral disapproval of homosexuality, and a moral conviction that heterosexuality better comports with traditional ( especially Judeo-Christian) morality. \"'251 DOMA's purpose perpetuated that stereotype for legally married same-sex couples on the state and federal levels: \"[DOMA] tells [same-sex] couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal recognition. This places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage.\"252 Such inferiority derives from a status quo preference for opposite-sex relationships, as the context in which heteronormative male-to-female gender roles are best replicated versus same-sex relationships, which ostensibly blurs or complicates those traditional gender roles. Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for Edith Windsor, intimates this motivating perception through the speculative comparisons between same-sex and opposite-sex parenting made by the Bipartisan Legal demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, a dignity conferred by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than an incidental effect of the federal statute.

Since Windsor framed the issue under equality principles, Justice Kennedy's import of Romer's animus concept was central to preventing DOMA's survival under rationality review: \"The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity.\"257 The holding illustrated the relationship between animus and dignity in Justice Kennedy's anti-stereotyping approach; DOMA's irrationality was partly demonstrated by the disproportionate dignitary harms the act inflicted upon same-sex couples and their families, all of which originated from a stereotypical animus toward same-sex couples' desires to marry.258 A major underlying message here was that stereotypical fears and prejudice toward same-sex couples cannot be 253.

For instance, Obergefell again illuminated the lived experiences of same-sex couples who faced exclusion from state marriage recognition. Using vivid vignettes to demonstrate the indignities of being barred from marriage, Justice Kennedy recounted the personal and poignant struggles of same-sex couples more deeply and profoundly than he had ever done in the prior pro­LGBTQ cases.268 James Obergefell's fleeting and makeshift out-of-state wedding to John Arthur inside a medical transport plane on a Baltimore airport tarmac was conveyed even more affectingly when Justice Kennedy described how the couple returned to their home state to find that their out­of-state marriage would not be recognized, so that when Arthur passed away, Obergefell could even not be listed as the surviving spouse on Arthur's death certificate. 269 Thus, both men were, as Justice Kennedy mournfully described, to \"remain strangers in death.\"270 In referencing history, as he had done in Lawrence, Justice Kennedy acknowledged the beginnings of marriage as a heteronormative status quo institution-a \"lifelong union of a man and woman [that] always has promised nobility and dignity to all persons, without regard to their station in life\"271 But marriage, according toJustice Kennedy, is also an evolving institution, one that can also recognize sexual minorities, whose intimate behaviors were once \"condemned as 265.

And both histories can overlap. Once medicalized stereotypes no longer pathologized same-sex eroticism as a disease, but such eroticism was seen as \"a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable,\"273 and once same-sex relationships became more visible and recognized, one might have anticipated that Justice Kennedy would have described queer identities as coming into their own in modem American society; yet, the history he eventually describes turns toward more normalizing respects to mirror what Obergefell was accomplishing. According to Justice Kennedy, just as \"same-sex couples began to lead more open and public lives,\" they also \"establish[ ed] families. \"274 In other words, they came out of a history of marginalization, only to specifically enter a world of domesticity. Queer individuals do create families and have always done so. But Justice Kennedy used the lived experience as an anti-stereotyping device to lift the perceived taint off sexual minorities, and then redirect them to associations with traditional marriage values. The sleight-of-hand gesture was part of a larger transposition to demonstrate that same-sex couples do not threaten the traditional institution of marriage-as mainstream stereotypes might have it. Instead, their desires to marry, coupled with depictions of their conformity to heteronormative values of family and domesticity, showed they would only fortify marriage instead. And Justice Kennedy's historical characterizations here, and the factual references to the litigant's experiences, all played into an argument for dignity. As with Windsor, in Obergefell, dignity is something acquired, and once acquired, confers status and privileges. Once Justice Kennedy established that same-sex couples, in contrast to what traditional stereotypes propounded, did value and treat marriage in the same way mainstream opposite-sex couples ideally have, their legal exclusion from marriage's dignifying possibilities amounted to injury.275 Justice Kennedy's literary anti-stereotyping devices now aligned with a doctrinal anti-stereotyping pairing of animus and dignity concepts, drawing the conclusion that if the status of marriage was denied to an outsider group that functionally 272.

Yet by virtue of their exclusion from that institution, same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage. This harm results in more than just material burdens. Same-sex couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives. As the State itself makes marriage all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion from that status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects. It demeans gays and lesbians for the State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation's society. Same-sex couples, too, may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage and seek fulfillment in its highest meaning.276 Essentially, this mechanism, revisited and developed further from Windsor, served again as the anti-stereotyping reasoning that drew same-sex couples into the institution of marriage in Obergefell. This time, the dignity of same­sex couples justified due process concerns that ultimately allowed anti­stereotyping principles to mediate toward extending them the fundamental right to marry. A study that threads Bowers and Obergefell on either side of the Court's journey from refusing to decriminalize consensual same-sex intimacy in 1986, to legally recognizing same-sex marriages in 2015, illuminates the rise of an important anti-stereotyping jurisprudence. Bowers had perceived and imbued Hardwick' s homosexuality with immorality, while both Windsor and Obergefell found same-sex couples worthy of dignification in marriage. In this journey, anti-stereotyping concepts, such as animus and dignity, arose to shed the influence of queer-phobic stereotypes, uncover the inflictions of discriminatory acts of exclusion, and expose the humanity that queer minorities share with the rest of society. In considering Windsor's holding, Reva Siegel alludes to the profound anti-stereotyping effect of Justice Kennedy's development of animus from Moreno: \"[Windsor] reasoned about the social meaning of disparate treatment in ways that have been unmistakably informed by long-running public debate-and by the experience and standpoint of the excluded.\"277 Siegel observes JusticeKennedy's conceptualization of animus and how its two possible meanings-\"hostility toward a politically unpopular group\" and a legislative 276.

The result is an equality opinion unlike any the Court has handed down in quite some time. \"280 But scholars have also noted limits in Justice Kennedy's anti-stereotyping approaches in Windsor and Obergefell. First, these approaches are used to mediate toward constitutional protections in lieu of traditional formalist strategies, such as finding sexuality worthy of class protection under equality principles.281 But this result might be because modem discrimination depends more on the regulation of norms rather than exclusion of classes or because, as Kenji Yoshino and others have described, in recent decades \"the Court has moved away from group-based equality claims under the guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to individual liberty claims under the due process guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. 282 Secondly, looking more closely at Justice Kennedy's anti-stereotyping jurisprudence itself, the flaws evident in how the jurisprudence is both re­conceptualized from Romer and Lawrence and applied in the marriage cases bear serious consideration. In the marriage cases, the anti-stereotyping approach is co-opted by heteronormativity. For instance, as Russell Robinson notes, the concept of animus is not as well articulated in Windsor as it could be for clarifying its concept of bias that, in tum, could have illustrated the heteronormative contours of anti-queer bias.283 Robinson 278.

The ambivalence may be caught up in some hesitancy for showing the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. A discussion on the gendered nature of marriage would seem to complicate the underlying message in Windsor that married same-sex couples have no reason to endure indignities created by DOMA's differentiation between them and married opposite-sex couples, when both groups should be treated equally. A revelation on the gendered nature of traditional marriage would have been ideally meaningful, as much bias against sexual minorities derives from the fortification of heteronormative gender roles. But unfortunately, that distinction would not have easily aligned with Windsor's objectives in the area of marriage, which accordingly served to further \"straight-jacket\" anti-stereotyping potentials in Windsor than in Lawrence. Spindelman's \"like straight\" description, used to illustrate how advocates in Lawrence campaigned, also aptly describes how the plaintiff couples litigated in Obergefell to facilitate Justice Kennedy's ability to draw resemblances between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples. In that way, anti-stereotyping approaches in the marriage cases fell short of their potential because part of the approach's mediating role included transposing same-sex couples from a hostile stereotype into a respectable one.

We see this particularly in how Justice Kennedy used the lived experiences of Windsor and Obergefell litigants to draw sameness to the status quo, without regarding how gendered and heteronormative that status quo is. Katherine Franke has remarked that same-sex couples' lawyers in Obergefell were careful in articulating sameness arguments.288 Her comments align with others who have observed that Obergefell's privileging ofrespectability was the necessary virtue of same-sex couples who wanted to be married.289 But with the most determined and empirical detail, Cynthia Godsoe has deconstructed the mainstream assimilated characteristics of the Obergefell couples for creating the \"perfect plaintiffs\" to persuade the Court that same­sex couples deserved the right to marry because, contrary to prior stereotypes that characterized same-sex couples as disrupting the status quo' s heteronormative practices and values, same-sex couples now in Obergefell resembled heightened versions of married opposite-sex couples within the status quo.290 These observations do articulate that anti-stereotyping approaches in Windsor and Obergefell fell short of developing an inclusive normative scope of anti-discrimination for queer minorities. Instead, lived experiences were channeled through anti-stereotyping approaches to help same-sex couples obtain entry into a traditionally heteronormative institution­particularly by downplaying prior stereotypes that the status quo found threatening to marriage, and then imbuing same-sex couples with connotations ofrespectability. In marriage, queer couples must now contend with status quo values and practices, including heteronormative ones. The implications from this application of Justice Kennedy's anti-stereotyping jurisprudence from the marriage cases was seen soon after Obergefell when the Court decided Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights 288.

A Colorado baker, citing religious beliefs against same-sex marriages, had refused to bake and sell a custom cake that was meant to celebrate the out-of-state wedding of a male same-sex couple, Charlie Craig and David Mullins.292 Here, respectable appearances mattered over queer lived experiences. Even when Colorado's public accommodations laws rightfully protected the couple from discrimination, the Masterpiece Court sided with the baker on religious hostility grounds related to the adjudication of the couple's case against the baker, rather than any hostility related to the actual incident itself.293 Compared to the Obergefell plaintiffs, the Masterpiece couple openly flaunted their sexualities, embraced gender nonconforming appearances, belonged to a lower socioeconomic status, and did not rear any children.294 In this sense, Masterpiece's married couple was \"more queer\" than the couples in the marriage cases because they did not embody assimilated or respectable characteristics; instead, Craig and Mullins violated gender expectations and family-oriented characteristics.295 Consequently, they likely threatened the status quo, even as a married couple. Justice Kennedy, who authored Masterpiece before retiring, did not apply his anti-stereotyping approach to find the couple any justice here.296 He did not even accurately depict the couple's lived experiences.297 Instead, the failed outcome for Craig and Mullins in Masterpiece was likely a result of the flaws that others have pointed out regarding Justice Kennedy's conceptualization of animus and dignity, and also the flaws of repeated application of anti-stereotyping approaches in contexts such as marriage, where assimilationist demands are susceptible. The anti-stereotyping jurisprudence from the pro-LGBTQ cases has remarkably addressed certain types of queer discrimination with recurring success since Romer. In some instances, with mixed success, concepts such as animus and dignity have helped litigants to overcome the stereotypes that perpetuate their marginalization by a discriminatory status quo. Inevitably, however, the Masterpiece predicament illustrates how the anti-stereotyping jurisprudence originally developed from Romer and Lawrence has now been 291. 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018).292.

Like Price Waterhouse's Title VII gender­stereotyping theory jurisprudence, the anti-stereotyping approach developed here in pro-LGBTQ cases are limited by underlying judicial failures for fully recognizing the gendered norms of a heteronormative status quo. Its uses for recognizing and articulating instances of anti-queerness need not be short lived at the Court, however. We wait to curiously ponder when and how these anti-stereotyping approaches may be revived to redress future examples of discrimination against queer individuals. IV.

Each litigant's experiences displayed varying possibilities of anti­stereotyping: Gerald Bostock, a well-respected Court Appointed Special Advocate (\"CASA\") in Clayton County, Georgia, had joined a gay recreational sports league in 2013, which made his sexuality a target of open criticism.303 Clayton County brought an internal audit over Bostock's use of CASA program funds, which, as Bostock claimed, pretextually discriminated against him for being gay. 304 Soon after, the county fired himfor '\"conduct unbecoming of a county employee. \"'305 What always remained unclear was whether that unbecoming conduct was the alleged misuse of funds or Bostock's openness about his sexuality. Donald Zarda's experience harbored even stronger anti-stereotyping possibilities. In 2010, Zarda was a skydiving instructor at Altitude Express. 306 Because instructors are often strapped physically to their clients during dives, Zarda, who was gay, would disclose his sexuality to female clients to allay any concerns of impropriety.307 After one skydiving session, a woman client complained that Zarda had touched her inappropriately, and Altitude Express subsequently fired Zarda. 308 Other men at the skydiving operation had joked about being strapped to clients, but Zarda alleged he was terminated because he had referenced his sexuality and failed to fit within a \"straight male macho stereotype.\"309 Lastly, Aimee Stephens, who had been assigned male at going to represent himself as a man' and 'wanted to dress as a woman,' falls squarely within the ambit of sex-based discrimination that Price Waterhouse and Smith forbid\") (citations omitted); Zarda v.

Compared to Justice Kennedy's major pro-LGBTQ opinions, the lives and experiences of Bostock, Zarda, and Stephens are not focal points for demonstrating aspects of shared humanity that could conjure persuasion for sexual orientation and gender identity protection. Rather, a textualist posture was much more absolute. In fact, according to Justice Gorsuch, \"[ w ]hen the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it's no contest. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.\"319 Textualism dominated in Bostock. Accordingly, absent in Bostock are the rhetorical devices Justice Kennedy had employed in prior pro-LGBTQ opinions that highlighted lived experiences. Unlike Windsor or Obergefell's revelations about the litigant's lives, Justice Gorsuch only narrates the details of Bostock, Zarda, and Stephens' discriminatory experiences just enough to contextualize the consolidated cases as instances of sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination. \"Few facts are needed to appreciate the legal question we face,\" Justice Gorsuch writes conspicuously to start his succinct facts section in Bostock. 320 Indeed, Justice Gorsuch narrates the litigant facts sparingly and transactionally. Lived experiences are only essential to establish discriminatory acts and considerations involving sexual orientation or gender identity; textualism would take care of the rest. In that respect, Gerald Bostock's account of being fired for \"unbecoming\" conduct here lacks any nuanced discussion of what kind of criticisms he received for being openly gay or what was Clayton County's idea of unbecoming conduct-whether such conduct was based on the alleged misuse of funds for which Bostock was investigated or on perceived notions regarding his male sexual identity.321 Similarly, Justice Gorsuch simplifies Donald Zarda's firing at Altitude Express by withholding the reason why Zarda had revealed his sexual identity to prevent inferences of impropriety between him and a skydiving client.322 Justice Gorsuch's version leaves out possible interpretations of gender stereotyping here-from enduring presumptions of heterosexuality as a male skydiving instructor with female clients to having standards of hetero-masculinity forced against him because of his known sexuality.323 Finally, Aimee Stephens' story was told quite dispassionately 319. Id.320. Id.321. See id. at 1737-38.322. See id. at 1738.323. See Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1738 (\"Donald Zarda worked as a skydiving instructorat Altitude Express in New York. After several seasons with the company, Mr. Zarda mentioned that he was gay and, days later, was fired.\"). 346 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 as well. Nothing in Justice Gorsuch's account mentions Harris Funeral Home's strict gendered dress codes for employees, nor does Justice Gorsuch excerpt the employer's misogyny and stereotypical reactions to Stephens' gender transformation-all of which had appeared in Stephens' brief in opposition. 324Also, missing in Bostock is the near-customary historicism that appeared often in pro-LGBTQ cases. The collective history of employment discrimination for non-heteronormative queer identities could have established a counter-factual narrative to historically persistent status quo stereotypes about LGBTQ identities. Ironically, Justice Samuel Alito's dissent documents these historical moments of discrimination against LGBTQ employees-but only to validate his point that Title VII had never been read to protect against sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination and that status quo premise ought to continue.325 What remains in Bostock are vacant specters of the prior pro-LGBTQ cases, not anti-stereotyping's resurrection. Whereas reading Romer, Lawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell together, those cases ended up intertextually woven because of common themes, doctrinal developments, or approaches-a collection that has prompted others to refer to them as a \"quadrilogy\" of gay rights cases. 326 The intertextual conclusion of reading Bostock against that quadrilogy is that prior anti-stereotyping rhetorical devices and theories do not matter. Lived experiences contextualize discrimination in Bostock, but do not in Justice Gorsuch' s rendering centrally define discrimination protections; they are only obligatory for showing that an employer discriminated based on an employee's sexual orientation or gender identity. Otherwise, the factual details in Bostock, Zarda, and Stephens' experiences are not worth mentioning. B. Preserving StereotypesAs a result of eclipsing the factual and historical iterations of lived experiences, Justice Gorsuch's textualism in Bostock functionally precludes the case's doctrinal anti-stereotyping potential. Although textualism helps sexual minorities secure Title VII protection, it does not counterbalance or 324. Compare id., with Brief for Respondent Aimee Stephens at 4-7, Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) (No. 18-107). 325. Bostock, 140 S.

In fact, by privileging textualism over examining discrimination based on stereotyping bias, Bostock ultimately preserves and privileges complicated heteronormative gender and queer stereotyping issues in workplace discrimination. 1. Because of SexInstead of focusing on experiences to demonstrate stereotyping bias thatmotivate animus affecting the dignity of queer minorities, Justice Gorsuch solely concentrates on protecting sexual minorities based on the reading of the word, \"sex,\" and the operative phrase, \"because of,\" in Title VII's original prohibition against employers from discriminating \"because of ... sex[.]\"327 Textualism exegetically situates \"sex\" within its 1960s dictionary vernacular-indeed, the specific definition the employers had advocated using. 328 \"Sex\" here refers to male or female biological status. 329 The employee litigants, meanwhile, had argued to define \"sex\" as a \"term [that ] bore a broader scope, capturing more than anatomy and reaching at least some norms concerning gender identity and sexual orientation.\"330 Comparatively, Bostock, Zarda, and Stephens' broader reading evinces perhaps a \"queerer\" understanding than the dictionary definition-perhaps one that would encompass gender roles and stereotyping.331 But working within textualist parameters, Justice Gorsuch adheres to reading \"sex\" with its biological designations.332 We cannot ignore that this interpretation also effectuates a status quo line-drawing of protected statuses under mainstream classifications of gender and sexuality that just so happens to be a logical and 327. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(l).328.

With \"because of,\" Justice Gorsuch applies a more legally-operative definition by resorting to recent Supreme Court decisions to help decide that \"because of' evinces a traditional and \"simple\" but-for causation standard. 334 Consequently, the functional parameters of Title VII's \"because of sex\" textualism is expansive.335 Actionable discrimination occurs even if the act or practice merely involved some remote aspect of biological sex: \"So long as the plaintiffs sex was one but-for cause of that decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\"336 This expansive reading also clarifies Justice Gorsuch's reluctance to rely on employee litigants' contemporaneous \"queerer\" meaning of \"sex,\" which would have included gender identity and sexual orientation norms; it would not have made a difference in the result.337 So again, biological sex controls. Justice Gorsuch's textualist construction of Title VII's \"because of sex\" language as prohibiting discrimination \"because of a protected characteristic 333. The artificiality of what Bostock accomplishes emerges more clearly in contrast to Zalesne's observation that \"[w]hen courts state that the term 'sex' in Title VII refers to 'gender,' they are generally referring to \"an individual's distinguishing biological or anatomical characteristics.\" See Deborah Zalesne, When Men Harass Men: Is It Sexual Harassment?, 7 TEMP.

Although Bostock would only be one part of a plaintiffs Title VII claim, otherelements must still be met. See Frith v. Whole Foods Mkt., Inc., No. 20-CV-11358- ADB, 2021 WL 413606 *l, *6 (D. Mass.

Frith involved a class action under a Title VII employment discrimination theory based on race in which Whole Foods grocery employees sued the grocery chain for adverse employment actions taken against them when they wore face masks with Black Lives Matter messaging at stores during the Covid-19 pandemic, which was against company policy. Id. at *1-3. The plaintiffs did not allege any employment retaliation based on their race but only allege a Title VII race discrimination claim because Whole Foods singled them out for wearing racial messaging on their face masks based on Bostock. Id. at *6-7. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs suit because it refused to apply Bostock so expansively; plaintiffs still needed to allege that Whole Foods have \"treated any individual plaintiffs differently if that plaintiffs were of a different race.\" Id. at *7.

Presumably, this result is why Justice Gorsuch had written that \"nothing in our approach to these cases turns on the outcome of the parties' debate,\" over biological sex or otherwise. Id.  2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 349 like sex\" necessitates a powerfully \"sweeping\" standard. His reading seemingly and, without further substantive thought, enshrines situations that derive from prominent characterizations of sexual orientation and gender identity experiences. 338 Henceforth, an individual employee who is fired based on the employer's knowledge that the employee is attracted to individuals of the same sex would have a claim under Title VII because the protected characteristic of \"sex\" is implicated as a but-for cause.339 Likewise, an employee who is fired because of a transition from an assigned birth sex could also recover under Title VII. 340 The textualist interpretation functionally, putatively, or implicitly induces protected statuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Textualism, thus, accomplishes Title VII sexual orientation and gender identity workplace protections. Finally, Justice Gorsuch's examination of the phrase \"discriminate against\" is less patently provocative but does critically restrict Title VII in three ways. First, his textualist approach reads Title VII as covering disparate treatment cases only.341 Secondly, such discrimination must be intentional.342 Lastly, \"because of sex\" discrimination is discrimination against individuals, not categorically against groups.343 How this reading of \"discriminate against\" works with Justice Gorsuch's \"because of sex\" interpretation has significances, as we will see, iefra. 2. Precluding Anti-Stereotyping TheoriesTextualism allows Justice Gorsuch to keep any evaluation of stereotypingbias in gender discrimination-and anti-queer discrimination-unaddressed in Bostock. In one passage, he minimizes the relevance of performative gender characteristics that motivate sex discrimination by diverting his rationale toward textualism. In his example of \"an employer who fires a woman, Hannah, because she is insufficiently feminine and also fires a man, Bob, for being insufficiently masculine,\" he focuses not on the gender stereotyping aspects involved, but observes instead that \"in both cases the employer fires an individual in part because of sex.\"344 Accordingly, TitleVII liability ensues and \"[i]nstead of avoiding Title VII exposure, this 338.

Id.at 1741.350 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 employer doubles it.\"345 His but-for causation approach detects sex discrimination, but it misses the point that gender expectations might also play a part in controlling norms of femininity and masculinity, as well or perhaps more significantly and directly than biological sex. Wouldn't firing employees for not being feminine or masculine enough illustrate termination based on social constructions of gender at least as well as biological sex? Although scholars have noted how stereotyping bias invigorate modem discrimination, this disregard for stereotyping bias in sex discrimination repeats elsewhere in Justice Gorsuch' s Bostock opinion. He continually re­reads discriminatory scenarios based solely on his textualist imprimatur. Even his reference to Price Waterhouse seems like a misappropriation of that case for textualist purposes. After recapitulating his but-for causation approach in another sex discrimination scenario where \"the employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee's sex when deciding to discharge the employee,\"346 he quotes Ann Hopkin's case. But his brief and generic quotations do not conjure Price Waterhouse's gender stereotyping rationale; they merely reiterate a background observation from the case that \"an individual employee's sex is 'not relevant to the selection, evaluation, or compensation of employees. \"'347 It is curious why he excerpts specifically from Price Waterhouse, only to ignore its gender stereotyping rationale and to affirm his posture about the relevancy of sex in employment decisions when other authorities could have sufficed. 348 What seems absolute to Justice Gorsuch is biological sex, not its accompanying social stereotypes. In fact, this primacy toward sex is also the reason why queer minorities are protected under his textualist reading-not any biased notions about their sexual identities. Is this putting the cart before the horse? Under Justice Gorsuch' s textualism, sexuality and gender identity are not relevant because, in his words, \"it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex. \"349 He later explains this impossibility to underscore the operations of Bostock's textualism: [H]omosexuality and transgender status are inextricably bound up withsex. Not because homosexuality or transgender status are related to sex insome vague sense or because discrimination on these bases has somedisparate impact on one sex or another, but because to discriminate on345.

For instance, the statutory language of Title VII itselfrelays the intent that genderis not a consideration for employment decisions. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2(a)(l), (2). 349. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741.2021] QUEERING BOSTOCKthese grounds requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex.350 351 As Supreme Court Justices have been regarded as part of the status quo,351 it is not difficult to conclude that Justice Gorsuch's observation exemplifies another moment of mainstream conceptualizing of gender and queemess­except, he is not medicalizing sexuality; it is just a but-for cause to him. In Bostock, Justice Gorsuch's examples all ignore the stereotyping aspects of employment discrimination. He points out the discriminatory actions but not the underlying heteronormative stereotyping that could be the motivator for such biased conduct. In part, motivation is not the requirement in Bostock' s textualism, but rather the employer's intent.352 But the intent requirement correspondingly means that bias also becomes irrelevant: Consider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer's mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague. Put differently, the employer intentionally singles out an employee to fire based in part on the employee's sex, and the affected employee's sex is a but-for cause of his discharge. Or take an employer who fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth. Again, the individual employee's sex plays an unmistakable and impennissible role in the discharge decision.353 These textualist attributes leave Justice Gorsuch' s approach lacking in the critical dimensions that anti-stereotyping approaches might have raised. Instead, Justice Gorsuch's approach is transactional and restrained. This textualist result is incredibly beneficial to sexual minorities in its effects. However, it also leaves behind some significant questions for sexual orientation and gender identity-one of which is what about the character 350. Id. at 1742.351.

Id. at 1741-42.352 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 and nature of modem discrimination and the lived experiences of queer minorities? Essentially, Bostock eliminates bias by eliminating discussions of bias. Textualism conflates-or perhaps associates-sex with sexual orientation, and sex with gender identity, but such relationships appear thin and not deeply substantive, depending only on the causation element that textualism enshrines in the phrase, \"because of.\" Contrary to various scholarly perspectives on Title VII, Justice Gorsuch seems to suggest that Title VII would not even consider anything deeper than what his but-for causation detects in discrimination cases, such as notions of stereotyping bias perhaps, because his reading of \"because of sex\" accomplishes discrimination while bypassing considerations of bias: When an employer fires an employee because she is homosexual or transgender, two causal factors may be in play-both the individual's sex and something else (the sex to which the individual is attracted or with which the individual identifies). But Title VII doesn't care. If an employer would not have discharged an employee but for that individual's sex, the statute's causation standard is met, and liability may attach.354 That \"something else\" could be what Justice Gorsuch lists in the accompanying parenthetical-the employer's considerations of same-sex attraction or gender identification, which would be motivated by bias. 355 Yet, the way he describes the reasons for discrimination is an unsophisticated, mechanical, and perhaps intentionally-nai've mischaracterization of sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination, and discrimination generally. What Justice Gorsuch fails to acknowledge here is the employer's motivated judgment against an individual's same-sex attraction or non-conforming gender identification-the bias that privileges stereotypical heteronormative gender role expectations of how individuals should have opposite-gender relationships, or how individuals should live according to their biologically­assigned sex at birth. When Justice Gorsuch writes that \"Title VII doesn't care\" about that \"something else,\" there is reason to probe suspiciously at that remark because examinations of heteronormative gendered biases are centrally relevant in modem discrimination cases.356 To further obscure the relevance of stereotyping and support his use of textualism, Justice Gorsuch presents several invariably revisionist readings 354. Id. at 1742.355. Id.356. Even under a disparate treatment approach to Title VII, gender bias appears asanimating model for determining discrimination. See Kya Rose Coletta, Women and (In)Justice: The Effects of Employer Implicit Bias and Judicial Discretion on Title VII Plaintiffi, 16 HASTINGS Bus. L.J. 175, 202 (2020). 2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 353 of three of the Court's more prominent Title VII sex discrimination decisions, Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp. 357 Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart,358 and Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. 359 All of these cases revealed stereotyping biases, but under his readings, Justice Gorsuch demonstrates how the discriminatory actions respectively support his textualist \"because of sex\" reading of Title VII. For instance, in Phillips, Justice Gorsuch characterizes what happened to Ida Phillips when Martin Marietta Corporation refused to hire her because she had young children as an example of when \"an employer discriminates intentionally against an individual only in part because of sex.\"360 This reading fundamentally obscures scholarly observations that Phillips is \"one of the first cases in which the Supreme Court addressed stereotypes in Title VII\" and \"Martin Marietta's deployment of generalizing ascriptive stereotype, lie at the heart of Phillips's claim.\"361 Similarly, in his reading of Manhart, Justice Gorsuch seemed to forget the stereotyping elements of an employment decision to require women employees to submit larger pension contributions than their male counterparts because mortality tables generalized that women outlived men.362 Instead, he claims here that \"the employer [in Manhart] violated Title VII because, when its policy worked exactly as planned, it could not 'pass the [but-for] test' asking whether an individual female employee would have been treated the same regardless of her sex. \"363 In contrast, the Manhart Court itself had opined that \"[i]t is now well recognized that employment decisions cannot be predicated on mere 'stereotyped' impressions about the characteristics of males or females.\"364 And lastly, his reading of Oncale,where the male plaintiff Joseph Oncale had been harassed by his male co­workers because of perceived homosexuality,365 only focused on what was consonant to his textualist but-for causation: \"Because the plaintiff alleged that the harassment would not have taken place but for his sex-that is, the plaintiff would not have suffered similar treatment if he were female-a 357. 400 U.S. 542 (1971) (per curiam).358. 435 U.S. 702 (1978).359. 523 U.S. 75 (1998).360.

Oncale never alleged that he would have received better treatment if he had been a woman.\"369 Thus, Justice Gorsuch's reading of Oncale appears rather colorable. Invariably, from these observations here, Bostock tacitly privileges a heteronormative status quo. In addressing the employers' bare admission that they had terminated the litigants for their sexuality or for being transgender, Justice Gorsuch never investigates the deeper existing stereotyped reasons underneath the employer's admissions: \"Sorting out the true reasons for an adverse employment decision is often a hard business, but none of that is at issue here.\"370 He focuses only on what is \"bound up\" with sex for his textualist approach to Title VII.371 Even when he acknowledges that \"an employer who discriminates against homosexual or transgender employees necessarily and intentionally applies sex-based rules,\" he never develops what those \"sex-based rules\" are-whether they implicate gender norms and stereotypes, which would seem prudent. 372 After all, Bowers andLawrence remind us that rules tend to be backed by normative considerations of their authors and enforcers. Instead, Justice Gorsuch only follows up with another long recapitulation of his textualist but-for causation, premised on finding discrimination when the but-for causation is partly \"bound up\" with the disparate treatment of an individual's sex: \"An employer that announces it will not employ anyone who is homosexual, for example, intends to penalize male employees for being attracted to men and female employees for being attracted to women.\"373 In one more comparative example, drawn up rhetorically, Justice Gorsuch further demonstrates the cogs of textualism while showing how it displaces aspects of gender stereotyping in 366.

Id. at 1742.372. Id. at 1745.373. Id.2021] QUEERING BOSTOCKdiscrimination under Title VII: Consider an employer eager to revive the workplace gender roles of the 1950s. He enforces a policy that he will hire only men as mechanics and only women as secretaries. When a qualified woman applies for a mechanic position and is denied, the \"simple test\" immediately spots the discrimination: A qualified man would have been given the job, so sex was a but-for cause of the employer's refusal to hire.374 355 As long as treatment of biological sex is involved in the disparity, discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity qualifies as \"because of sex\" under Title VII: \"The 'simple [but-for] test' thus overlooks that it is really the applicant's bucking of 1950s gender roles, not her sex, doing the work. So, we need to hold that second trait constant.\"375 No need arises for anti-stereotyping theories. While textualism would recognize situations involving gender stereotypes as Title VII sex discrimination, it excludes them in the substantive analysis, only seeking a basis involving biological sex as the controlling litmus. In essence, Bostock's textualism leaves sex stereotypes-and their underlying perniciousness toward queer minorities-unexamined. What also remains unexamined and unchallenged, as well consequentially, is the heteronorrnative status quo. C. Converging InterestsJustice Gorsuch's neglect of anti-stereotyping potentials seems heavy­handed in Bostock. Despite textualism's sweeping effect for enveloping sexual orientation and gender identity statuses within Title VII protection, that protection remains tenuous after Bostock-solely linked by Justice Gorsuch's textualist approach, essentially under an operative reading of Title VII. Such protections for queer identities are merely as strong as they aretransitively linked to sex under Justice Gorsuch's textualism. However,examining the converging interests in Bostock might explain why thedecision both protects sexual minorities from discrimination, but also failsto address the substantive heteronorrnative biases that animate suchdiscrimination.In analyzing moments of racial progress, such as Brown v. Board of Education,376 critical race theorist Derrick Bell posited in his take on the Court's desegregation ruling that where a subordinated group advances from some prior inequality to achieve progress, such advances arise because the subordinated group's interests have converged with the interests of the status 374. Id. at 1748.375. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1748-49.376. 347 U.S. 483 (1954).356 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 quo.377 Under Bell's interest-convergence thesis, Brown's desegregationholding was not purely a status quo acknowledgment of African-American racial inequities, it also helped the United States' democratic image abroad during the Cold War.378 Recently, others have imported Bell's theory intocritical readings of marriage equality and other LGBTQ advancements. 379 Reading Bostock through the interest-convergence lens might clear some of the scholarly curiosity over this decision's pro-queer stance and yet cold, textualist rationale that leaves heteronormative bias against sexual minorities unaddressed. 1. Privileging Heteronormative ValuesEmployment discrimination protections have been an entrenched interestfor sexual minorities. 380 Bostock' s textualist approach fulfills that interest byproviding federal workplace protections and settling the debate over Title VII' s reach into sexual orientation and gender identity protections. Yet, by ignoring lived experiences and anti-stereotyping opportunities to doctrinally address heteronormative gender role stereotyping that substantively connects sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination to sex discrimination, textualism tacitly preserves and condones the persistence of heteronormative values and stereotypes against queer minorities. Unlike Justice Kavanaugh's Bostock dissent, where ordinary meaning is used to categorically deny protections to sexual minorities and preserve wholesale the interests of a heteronormative status quo,381 Justice Gorsuch's majority provides acontrolled mechanism for equality that more subtly retains the status quo' s posture for deciding the protective boundaries of Title VII sex discrimination, and also over who accordingly deserves protection. Besides the examples above that show Justice Gorsuch' s re-reading of 377. Derrick A. Bell, Jr., Comment, Brown v. Board of Education and the Interest­Convergence Dilemma, 93 HARV. L. REv. 518, 523 (1980) (\"The interest of blacks in achieving racial equality will be accommodated only when it converges with the interests of whites.

Ct. at 1825-30 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 357 gender and queer discrimination scenarios, one cannot overlook how the decision simultaneously recognizes an employer's religious convictions when they conflict with Title VII sex discrimination protections. Appearing at the opinion's near conclusion, the Court reveals that, \"[ w ]e are also deeply concerned with preserving the promise of the free exercise of religion enshrined in our Constitution; that guarantee lies at the heart of our pluralistic society.\"382 Religious values, such as those promoted by Judeo-Christian traditions, often bolster heteronormative views-not to mention stereotypes-on gender and sexuality.383 Thus, when Justice Gorsuch invokes First Amendment religious protections affirmed under Hosanna­Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. EEOC384 and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,385 Bostock effectively completes the tacit preservation of heteronormativity and stereotyping already existing in its textualism. Discriminatory workplace practices animated by anti-LGBTQ stereotyping bias might coincide with \"because of sex\" discrimination in Title VII and protect sexual minorities within the context of employment. But the underlying animus toward sexual minorities are not subverted, rather the engines that stoke such animus are venerated. This preservation is one example of converging interests in Bostock. 382. Id. at 1754. In a similar stroke just one Term after Bostock, the Courtunanimously sided with a Catholic-based foster agency's free exercise of religion in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, No. 19-123, 2021 WL 2459253 (U.S. June 17, 2021). In Fulton, the city of Philadelphia ceased to refer foster children to Catholic Social Services (\"CSS\") after observing that CSS would not certify same-sex couples as prospective foster parents. Id. at *4. The city's reason was that CSS's refusal to same-sex couples \"violated a non-discrimination provision in its contract with the City as well as the non­discrimination requirements of the citywide Fair Practices Ordinance.\" Id. By finding that CSS's foster services do not fall within the realm of public accommodations, Chief Justice Robert's majority opinion essentially removed from debate the issue that CSS had violated any non-discrimination provisions protecting against sexual orientation discrimination. Id. at *8. Though narrow, the Fulton ruling privileges religious exercise over the rights of same-sex couples by virtually creating a religious exemption for CSS: \"We do not doubt that this interest is a weighty one, for ' [ o ]ur society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.' On the facts of this case, however, this interest cannot justify denying CSS an exception for its religious exercise.\" Id. at *9 (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop, 138 S.Ct., at 1727). The Court here seems to continue its signaling since Masterpiece Cakeshop and Bostock that religious liberties preside over queer lived experiences. 383. Gillian R.

Enabling Future PrecedentsAnother instance of interest convergence arises with Bostock' s influence as a major controlling precedent for future textualist readings of Title VII in challenges that may take place involving other protected categories. Bostock' s textualist reading of \"because of sex\" hardens an already­cementing anti-classification approach to Title VII discrimination.386 Justice Gorsuch's reading of Title VII as protecting individuals from intentional discrimination promotes Title VII generally as a disparate treatment solution to workplace sex discrimination and underscores Title VII's anti­classification aspects.387 In the opinion, he explicitly and repeatedly rejects an approach to Title VII based on group discrimination. 388 When everything is interpreted through a but-for causation linked to a monolithic notion of \"sex,\" that reading engenders blindness toward differences in gender and sexualities much like color-blind approaches to race discrimination.389 Indeed, by reading \"because of sex\" as \"because of a protected characteristic like sex,\" textualism here affords a broad standard that finds discrimination whenever biological sex is remotely implicated. On the one hand, this approach achieves sexual orientation and gender identity protection. But what if the same textualist approach is applied to other protected categories, particularly \"race\" under a 1960s dictionary meaning? If \"because of race\" is read similarly as here in Bostock-as \"because of a protected characteristic like race,\" then what is the result? Recognizing Title VII discrimination textually as an intentional act against an individual based on stable definitions of race forecloses anti-subordination approaches and other frameworks for addressing racial inequities that approximate disparate 386.

I argue that this assumption is not only false, but that race color blindness when applied to the complexities of civil society--to actual decision-making in such areas as contracting, employment, and admissions--is not race-neutral. Instead, it is a disguised form ofracial privileging.\"). 2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 359 impact solutions recognized in Griggs v. Duke Power Company.390 Indeed, as some have noted, Bostock's textualism would conflict with affirmative action policies.391 Such policies could be read as discriminatoryif Justice Gorsuch's characterization of \"because of sex\" discrimination under Title VII is transferred, for instance, into the realm of workplace race discrimination because of how the carve-outs to diversify based on race in affirmative action policies have been characterized as reverse discrimination under disparate treatment theories.392 Two observations of Bostock'sperniciousness derive from considering the decision's future impact as Title VII precedence. First, though Bostock is in effect a pro-LGBTQ decision, its textualism may abolish affirmative action policies and, in turn, also more deeply entrench \"colorblind\" anti-classification approaches to anti­discrimination in the future. And so, the colorblind analogy in Bostock's \"we don't see historically-marginalized queer identities, we only see sex\" approach would then become fully realized in a \"we don't see historically­marginalized racial identities, we only see race\" approach. But specifics matter. Secondly, in a broad context, if this precedential effect on future race-based discrimination cases occurs, then Bostock facilitates the Court's ability to nitpick which minority category deserves more privileging-in this case, marginalized sexual identities in employment over marginalized racial groups. 3. Diversifying Corporate AmericaFinally, despite providing Title VII protection for sexual minonttes,Bostock' s textualist approach also seems propelled by another converging interest: Bostock engenders positive optics for America's corporate status quo. American businesses have incentives to promote workplace diversity.393 The underlying benefits of such investments are not lost uponindividual workers who represent various backgrounds in the American workplace; diversity initiatives create employment opportunities that 390. 401 U.S. 424 (1971).391.

In recent decades, workplace ratings of companies have included their acceptance of openly-identified LGBTQ workers, and well-branded corporations have promoted openly-gay managers to the top of their organizational hierarchies. 395 Among the Bostock amici, filings from corporate America stressed the value of workplace diversity and, particularly, how corporate America values its LGBTQ employees. For example, in its amicus brief supporting Bostock, Zarda, and Stephens, the \"Fortune 200\" tobacco giant, Altria Group, Inc., articulated its own efforts toward fostering an inclusive workplace for LGBTQ employees \"because creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace benefits both the company and its employees.\"396 In turn, such benefits are so because \"[ e ]mployees are more productive in inclusive workplaces, and the satisfaction of its employees helps drive Altria's success.\"397 Of course, externally as well, Altria' s efforts have significant branding effects as \"investment in diversity and inclusion has led to Altria being repeatedly named by Forbes as one of America's best employers and being rated among the 'Best Places to Work' for 2018 and 2019 by the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index.\"398 Substantively, Altria also supported gender stereotyping theories for extending Title VII protections to LGBTQ individuals and underscored the harms to businesses with continued sexual orientation and gender identity workplace discrimination. 399 Even more impressively, another amicus brief filed by a group of 206 394.

The failure to recognize that Title VII protects LGBT workers would hinder the ability of businesses to compete in all comers of the nation, and would harm the U.S. economy as a whole.400 Specifically, these business amici remarked on their awareness of the purchasing power of LGBTQ individuals: \"A diverse and inclusive workforce likewise furthers businesses' ability to connect with consumers, particularly given that the buying power of diverse groups has increased substantially over the past 30 years. In 2015, the buying power of LGBT people in the United States stood at over $900 billion.\"401 Business amici also observed that \"[r]ecent studies confirm that companies with LGBT­inclusive workplaces also have better financial outcomes. \"402 These filings here are important first-hand acknowledgments of mainstream corporate America's interests in LGBTQ diversity in the workplace. Extremely pernicious observations arise when critiquing corporate America's interests here. These observations all stem from recognizing the overlap between mainstream corporate America's interests in Title VII's workplace discrimination protections for sexual minorities and the status quo policing of \"good\" versus \"less desirable\" queer minorities-the kind of policing that has developed in tandem with the acceptance of marriage equality and societal validation ofrespectable gay identities. First, as Yurvaj Joshi has observed, \"[ c ]onspicuous consumption has been crucial to the construction of gay men and, to a lesser extent, lesbians as respectable citizen-consumers.\"403 Because \"today's gay and lesbian identities are constituted less by sexual practice and rather more by consumption,\" the result \"is a complex and symbiotic relationship between 'the gay community' and 'the gay market' and, that being the case, one cannot meaningfully separate the politics of being gay from the business of buying and selling gay .',4°4 Thus, there is a status quo privileging of which sexual minority is the marketable one and which is not: \"[W]ho is viewed as a gay 400.

Queer minorities are caught in the middle of this tension. As D'Emilio notes, \"[o]n the one hand, capitalism continually weakens the material foundation of family life, making it possible for individuals to live outside of the family, and for a lesbian and gay male identity to develop. On the other, it needs to push men and women into families, at least long enough to reproduce the next generation of workers.''411 This push for families ought to reverberate significantly with the discussion in Part III, supra, of Justice Kennedy's interpretation of gay history, where the growing visibility of same-sex couples also coincided with the forming of families-one of his underlying justifications for extending marriage rights to same-sex couples and one of 405.

As Richard Delgado has observed, Bell's interest convergence theory depicts the negotiation of equality through a materialist perspective: \"Interest convergence is a form of materialist analysis which seeks to explain the shifting tides of racial history by reference to underlying conditions such as labor needs, international competition, and the search for profit.\"414 Despite the corporate interest and need to include LGBTQ workers, the recognition of LGBTQ workers exists within workplaces where presumably heteronormative gender roles prevail, leaving respectability as the prescription for inclusion and survival.415 As \"[ s ]exual norms operate at the level of aspirational fantasy and as a form of social status,\" this respectability-driven corporate inclusiveness places major stereotyping expectations on LGBTQ individuals.416 Joshi notes that \"[ m Jost professional contexts, even those touted as being 'gay friendly,' maintain heteronormative ideas of gender and sexuality, adherence to which remains a precondition of institutional citizenship. LGBT professionals must tread carefully, and refrain from expressing their personal identities in personal and political ways that might be deemed 'unprofessional.\"'417 And so from the rise and dominant exclusion of non­heteronormative identities during the modem industrialization era all the way to the federal employment protections of sexual minorities secured in Bostock, a peculiar narrative comes to a full spiral rotation. In its new 412.

D'Emilio observes that the ideology of the family that is needed to maintain acapitalist labor force-in essence, to \"drive[] people into heterosexual families\"-in a modem capitalist world that also separates the physical bond of traditional family units altogether generates an \"instability\" for which non-heteronormative individuals have been targeted as \"scapegoats.\" D'EMILIO, Capitalism and Gay Identity, supra note 39, at 473. 416.

By leaving heteronormative stereotypes preserved, Bostock is complicit. Bostock fulfills Title VII protections for sexual minorities, while its textualism allows the heteronormative status quo the opportunity to continue fulfilling its gendered scripts, which includes privileging assimilated sexual minorities over others who might, otherwise, threaten status quo norms. From an interest-convergence perspective, Bostock's holding reveals how the status quo's interests converge with the protective interest that the Bostock litigants sought under Title VII. Importing Bell's thesis into Bostock helps explain why the Court might have chosen textualism to protect queer minorities under Title VII, but failed to theorize the real substance of employment discrimination premised on sexual orientation and gender identities. D. Reviving Anti-StereotypingDespite Bostock' s disregard for approaching the litigants' lived experiences through an anti-stereotyping lens and how converging interests disclose ulterior motives for its textualist holding, the Court's decision does not, however, foreclose anti-stereotyping resolutions in future discrimination cases. Because Obergefell's anti-stereotyping approach evinces inherent flaws that privilege assimilated gay identities over others, and because Bostock's textualism leaves heteronormative gender stereotypes intact, future pro-LGBTQ decisions must revive and develop anti-stereotyping rationales that appropriately and honestly regard the experiences of queer minorities. Interest convergence will likely reappear to cabin some of that discussion at every instance, but the arc toward fuller equality in various issues has often-especially for LGBTQ movements-been incremental.418As Bostock' s textualist precedent is being applied to protect individuals who have experienced sexual orientation and gender identity protections, a few considerations exist for ensuring that stereotyping and erasure of lived experiences do not continue in future precedents. Bostock is a major development; but if modem discrimination is fueled by discriminatory norms and stereotypes, then the visibility of lived experiences must persist to challenge those norms and stereotypes.419418. See, e.g., WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE JR., EQUALITY PRACTICE: CIVIL UNIONS AND THE FUTURE OF GAY RIGHTS xiii-xiv (2002). 419. Kramer, supra note 134, at 929. Again, Kramer is helpful to remind us thatmodem discrimination has more to do with work-culture norms and theways in which an employee's behavior violates these norms .... Modem discrimination is the product of a complex web of work-culture norms, 2021] QUEERING BOSTOCK 365 Bostock's textualism does not preclude future Title VII decisions from reviving gender stereotyping theories that derive from Price Waterhouse. Although any prevailing interpretation of Price Waterhouse remains tenuous amongst the circuits, perhaps the bootstrapping considerations that once prevented some federal courts from applying sex stereotyping rationales to sexual minority litigants are now less applicable after Bostock functionally conjoins Title VII sex discrimination with either discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In fact, lower federal precedence has recognized the viability of Title VII gender stereotyping theories in Bostock' s aftermath, even in a circuit that previously denied the use of gender stereotyping by gay and lesbian litigants in Title VII cases.420 Shortly after Bostock, a Virginia federal district court within the Fourth Circuit allowed gender stereotyping theories to survive a motion to dismiss challenge from an employer who had relied on the bootstrapping rationale.421The Fourth Circuit had previously refused to grant the use of Price Waterhouse for sexual orientation claims in Title VII gender stereotyping cases because of \"bootstrapping\" concems.422 But, in the court's perspective, Bostock had made the bootstrapping concerns irrelevant because Title VII sex discrimination now includes sexual orientation discrimination cases.423 Likely, similar rationale that reconciles gender stereotyping in circuits that previously allowed Price Waterhouse to be applied to sexual minority litigants in Title VII cases would also find gender stereotyping still viable despite Bostock. Hence, where possible, in post-Bostock employment cases, both textualism and gender stereotyping theories ought to reside side­by-side. Additionally, since Title VII precedents exact influence over Title IX discrimination cases,424 Bostock's application here in the educational context stereotypes, and unconscious biases, which work together to make discrimination subtle, messy, and more personal than ever before.

Additionally, relying on Bostock, the Department of Education has specifically interpreted that Title IX protects against sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination. See U.S. Dept. of Educ., U.S. Department of Education Confirms Title IX Protects Students from Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender 366 JOURNAL OF GENDER, SOCIAL POLICY & THE LAW [Vol. 29:3 is certainly guaranteed. Again, as anti-stereotyping approaches were not foreclosed but only overshadowed by Justice Gorsuch's textualism in Bostock, future decisions in Title IX can continue anti-stereotyping theories to complement the textualist approach to sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination. An example from the Eleventh Circuit shortly after the Bostock decision is illustrative here. In Adams by and through Kasper v. School Board of St. Johns County,425 Drew Adams, whose birth-assigned sex was female, started transitioning during adolescence after suffering from gender dysphoria and realizing he was transgender.426 While transitioning, he began using the boy's restroom at his high school, but school officials forbade him from doing so because of the School District's bathroom policy that segregated restroom use based on biological sex.427 Because Adams had entered the school district in the fourth grade as female, the school officials deemed him biologically female and enforced the bathroom policy, prohibiting him from using the boys' restroom.428 Further, the School Board later declined to adopt a more inclusive bathroom policy, ultimately differentiating Adams and leaving him '\"alienated and humiliated. \"'429 Adams sued and prevailed; the School Board then appealed.430 Siding with Adams, the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged the applicability of Bostock's but-for causation in a Title IX action: \"Bostock explained that if an employer fires a transgender female employee but retains a non­transgender female employee, this differential treatment is discrimination because of sex.\"431 But, unlike Justice Gorsuch's hermetic and exclusively textualist decision, the court considered Adams' experiences from the school board's treatment, detailing at great length how Adams \"suffered harm\" and acknowledged distress and anxiety caused by the stigma that the bathroom Identity (Jun. 16, 2021 ), https:/ /www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department­education-confirms-title-ix-protects-students-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation­and-gender-identity. The Department of Education's notice of interpretation specifically observes the textual resemblances between Title VII and Title IX, and applies Bostock's protections against discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity to Title IX protections consistently.

Future cases along these lines will be welcomed developments for animus-dignity anti-stereotyping, especially since such jurisprudence would no longer be cabined in the marriage context. Although Bostock preserves heteronormativity, its textualism also accomplishes a bare aggregation of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity conceptions through its simple but-for causation. Implications for a deeper \"queering\" of these conceptions intrinsically within Bostock might be thin; but doctrinally for the purposes of Title VII at least, sex discrimination appears to functionally envelope sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination, and cosmetically it coincides with various scholarly and judicial considerations that have more \"thickly\" or profoundly linked these types of concepts together.436 In a sense, Bostock exemplifies how the status 432.

Again, as Altria and the numerous business amici articulated in their briefs, the interests of corporate diversity would not seem bothered by this import in federal workplace protections because LGBTQ inclusion engenders significant capital. 437 From this perspective, courts following Bostock might capture this conceptual blurring and importing of sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination cases under constitutional sex equality jurisprudence. Although no direct precedence yet exists, this import appears possible since the jurisprudential boundaries between Title VII sex discrimination cases and constitutional sex equality cases are often porous.438 For early precedence that imports Bostock into constitutional sex discrimination without a statutory anchor, the Court of Appeals of North Carolina recently applied Bostock in a case where a woman who terminated a same-sex relationship was denied state domestic violence protections because North Carolina laws protected partners in opposite-sex relationships, rather than same-sex ones.439 The claimant in ME. v. T.J. based part of her appeal on Fourteenth Amendment equal protection grounds, and the appeals court found through application of anti­stereotyping approaches in Romer, Windsor, Lawrence, and Obergefell that the claimant's case warranted intermediate scrutiny.440 In an additional validation of the sex discrimination finding here, the court applied Bostock specifically to demonstrate \"that equal protection challenges of a law based upon LGBTQ+ status are also challenges based upon 'sex' or gender and, therefore, require at least 'intermediate scrutiny. ,,,44J Without a statutory anchor that would afford a textualist reading, the court here, nonetheless, imported Bostock's associations of sex with sexual orientation and gender identity categories. The court noted Bostock's applicability to Supreme Court equality jurisprudence because \"the Supreme Court has held that 'because of language used to determine a 'discriminatory purpose' when (finding sexual orientation is sex discrimination within the Title VII context, because \"[ f]undamental to the definition of homosexuality is the sexual attraction to individuals of the 'same sex.' ... One cannot consider a person's homosexuality without also accounting for their sex: doing so would render 'same' and 'own' meaningless.\"). 437. Brief for 206 Businesses, supra note 400, at 11.438.

Moreover, the court here used anti­stereotyping considerations of what constituted \"racial animus\" from North Carolina cases to analogize and further supplement the textualist foundations of Bostock' s conceptualization of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity categories.446 This decision demonstrates an expansive potential that can eventually erode the textualist basis for Bostock' s determination that sex discrimination is sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination, and replace it with anti-stereotyping ones-perhaps from LGBTQ cases or sex stereotyping cases-to use the lived experiences of queer discrimination to reach higher protections under constitutional equal protection. Again, lived experiences must matter in modem discrimination. Despite its protective and expansive holding, Bostock preserves a heteronormative and discriminatory status quo.

CONCLUSIONDonald Zarda and Aimee Stephens did not live to witness the Supreme Court validate their Title VII identities.447 Of the three Bostock litigants,only Gerald Bostock lived to experience the arrival of the Court's ruling.448 During a pandemic year, where often the lived experiences of the modern workplace migrated to virtual environments out of necessity, Bostock learned of the decision while on a virtual conference call for his current occupation as a mental health counselor.449 He celebrated by \"let[ting] out abig scream\" and \"hugg[ing] his partner.\"450 Likewise, the thought of TitleVII employment protections in the Court's holding should certainly give queer individuals much to cheer, knowing the post-Obergefell quandary of marriage rights without employment protections no longer endures. Yet, the Court's tacit disinclination in Bostock to substantively examine and address what motivates anti-queer bias while the Court promoted its expansive textualist rationale is quite curious. By proceeding on that curiousness-by queering Bostock in a way-we see here that the Court's advancements are driven by status quo convictions, rather than more genuine motivations toward understanding and recognizing queer lived experiences. Bostock's validation is a mixed blessing, and much remains to be addressed beyond the Court's textualism. For a decision about work, no doubt more work ostensibly lies ahead. 447.

    "abstract": "Although the Supreme Court’s 2020 Title VII decision, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, is a victory for LGBTQ individuals, its doctrinal limitations unavoidably preserve a discriminatory status quo. This Article critically examines how and why Bostock fails to highlight the indignities experienced by queer minorities under decades of employment discrimination. In Bostock, Justice Gorsuch presents a sweeping textualist interpretation of Title VII that protects against sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination. Yet, the decision sparsely recognizes queer lived experiences, compared to prior pro-LGBTQ cases where such recognition contributed to developing an anti-stereotyping framework that confronted some of the heteronormative biases that invigorate discrimination against queer individuals. In contrast, Bostock avoids any meaningful acknowledgment of the lives of the litigants or the experiences of anti-queer bias in exchange for a lengthy illumination of Justice Gorsuch’s textualist rationale.When conceptions of sexuality and gender identity have been previously mischaracterized in favor of mainstream heteronormative values, the lived experiences of queerness are paramount for detecting discrimination and correcting it. This Article argues that Bostock’s neglect of queer lived experiences was not a forgivable oversight, merely collateral to its expansive textualist reading of Title VII. Rather, the neglect of lived experiences and anti-stereotyping frameworks was the price queer minorities had to pay for Title VII protection. In this way, this Article shows that Justice Gorsuch’s lack of regard for the lived experiences in Bostock tacitly privileges heteronormative values, underscores the status quo’s interest convergence, and ultimately limits the decision’s transformative appeal",
