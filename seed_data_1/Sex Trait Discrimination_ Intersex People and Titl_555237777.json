Parry (Do Not Delete) 12/19/22 12:28 PM  1149 SEX TRAIT DISCRIMINATION: INTERSEX PEOPLE AND TITLE VII AFTER BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY Sam Parry* Abstract: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from workplace discrimination and harassment on account of sex. Courts have historically failed to extend Title VII protections to LGBTQ+ people. However, in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County changed this. Bostock explicitly extended Title VII’s protections against workplace discrimination to “homosexual” and “transgender” people, reasoning that it is impossible to discriminate against an employee for being gay or transgender without taking the employee’s sex into account. While Bostock is a win for LGBTQ+ rights, the opinion leaves several questions unanswered. The reasoning in Bostock heavily implies the existence of a sex and gender binary, and the Court names only two groups—transgender and homosexual people—for protection. Therefore, it remains unclear whether people who fall outside of the sex or gender binary are protected under Title VII. This Comment focuses on one non-binary group, intersex people, and asks whether Title VII covers intersex people after Bostock. This Comment starts by defining the term intersex and exploring the cultural and legal context of intersex people in the United States. It then turns to Title VII, detailing Title VII’s history and the Court’s reasoning in Bostock v. Clayton County. This Comment concludes that Title VII covers intersex people after Bostock because the Court’s definition of sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of sex traits. Because all intersex people have a natural variation in at least one sex trait (i.e., a trait that humans use to determine sex), Title VII categorically covers intersex people after Bostock. INTRODUCTION Corey is an intersex person who works for a large employer. Corey was born with Swyer syndrome,1 which means she has an uncommon combination of sex traits. She has XY sex chromosomes—a “male” genotype—but she has neither testes nor ovaries. While Corey’s internal and external anatomy look typically female, she did not naturally develop breasts or grow pubic hair during puberty.2 As a youth she received hormone therapy, and she has female secondary sex characteristics as an  * J.D.

Corey’s employer learns of her Swyer syndrome—learns that she has XY chromosomes—and decides to fire her on these grounds. Outraged, Corey sues her employer. She alleges that her employer discriminated against her because of her sex. Does Corey have a valid claim under Title VII? This Comment seeks to answer that very question: are intersex people covered under Title VII’s prohibition against sex discrimination? In 2020, the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County3 extended Title VII’s protections against workplace discrimination to include homosexual and transgender people.4 However, it remains unclear whether LGBTQ+ people who do not fall into these two categories can prevail on a sex discrimination claim under Title VII. In a social and legal system that assumes rigid sex differences, intersex people present a particular problem for courts. Intersex people, such as the fictional Corey, have natural variations in physical traits that humans use to determine sex.5 Because current Title VII jurisprudence assumes there are only two sexes, the legal status of intersex people remains in limbo. Part I of this Comment examines the cultural and historical context of intersex people, including the relationship between intersex identities and various LGBTQ+ identities. Part II surveys intersex jurisprudence, determining whether courts have included intersex people under sex or gender anti-discrimination laws. It then focuses on one anti-discrimination law in particular—Title VII—and details the statute’s scope following Bostock v. Clayton County. Part III analyzes whether Title VII covers intersex people given the Court’s ruling in Bostock. Ultimately, this Comment concludes that under the Bostock Court’s definition of “sex,” Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex traits.6 Because all intersex people have a variation in at least one sex trait, Title VII categorically covers intersex people after Bostock. I. THE CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF INTERSEX PEOPLE Current anti-discrimination laws do not reflect changing understandings of sex and gender in the United States.

Intersex people are particularly poorly understood by both the public and the legal system. Although intersex people make up an estimated 1.7% of the U.S. population,8 legislators and the courts effectively ignore them. This Part explains the meaning of “intersex,” contextualizes intersex people and intersex rights within the larger LGBTQ+ community, and examines legal barriers and discrimination that intersex people face. A. Defining “Intersex” The word “intersex” is an umbrella term referring to people whose sex traits or reproductive anatomy do not fit within the sex binary.9 The Oxford English Dictionary defines intersex as: [a] person who . . . is physically intermediate between male and female, having characteristics of both sexes (in a species which normally has two distinct sexes), or having sexual organs which are not fully developed as either male or female or which do not correspond to the individual’s chromosomal sex.10 Other definitions of “intersex” include “existing or occurring between the sexes,”11 and “having or combining the characteristics of both sexes; intermediate between male and female.”12 Because a person is labeled “intersex” based on entirely physical characteristics, the medical industry has been involved in categorizing intersex traits.13 As a result, intersex people are often discussed using medicalized terms, including a recent shift to the term “Disorder of Sex Differentiation/Development” or  7.

Idaho 2020) (litigating a ban on transgender high school athletes playing on sports teams in line with their gender identity); Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015) (litigating the right to same-sex marriage). 8.

BIOLOGY 151, 159 tbl.8 (2000). There are not reliable statistics on what percentage of the population has intersex traits. However, this much-quoted survey of medical records by Brown University biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling estimates the percentage to be around 1.7%. Although the study was published in 2000, it remains the most recent statistic available.  9. What is Intersex?, INTERSEX SOC’Y OF N.

For example, the Intersex Society of North America16 lists over twenty intersex variations.17 Some examples of intersex variations include Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, in which people with “male” XY chromosomes do not respond to testosterone, leading to genital and secondary sex characteristic development that appears more typically female.18 Klinefelter syndrome is another variation, in which people have an XXY chromosome pattern and may develop a small penis and testes, develop breasts, or be infertile—while other individuals will appear typically male.19 Yet another variation, Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, occurs when a variation of an enzyme leads to a high exposure to androgenic (“male”) hormones in utero.20 This leads people with XX chromosomes to have a variety of external genitalia, such as an enlarged clitoris or genitals that look more like a male child’s.21 Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia can also lead to development of “male” secondary sex characteristics during puberty, such as body hair, facial hair, a deep voice,  14.

B. Explaining Gender, Sex, Intersex, and LGBTQ+ Identities To situate intersex people legally and socially, one must understand the differences between sex, gender, and various LGBTQ+ identities. In American English, the words sex and gender describe related, though not identical, concepts. “Sex” is determined by physical, observable traits relating to sexual organs or secondary sex characteristics that classify a person, most commonly, as a “male” or “female.”33 There is debate over which qualities contribute to a person’s sex, with some medical definitions including up to nine distinct attributes: chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, internal morphological sex, external morphological sex, hormonal sex, secondary sex characteristics, assigned sex, gender of rearing, and gender identity.34 In the United States, a person’s identification documents establish that person’s legal sex.35 Of these documents, the birth certificate is the most important legal indicator of sex.36 Birth certificates reflect the sex a person was assigned at birth, based on the appearance of their external genitalia.37 All subsequent forms of identification reflect the birth certificate.38 Gender, in contrast, is determined by non-physical characteristics often associated with maleness or femaleness (or masculinity and femininity).39  32. See, e.g., Est. of DiMarco v. Wyo. Dep’t of Corr., Div. of Prisons, 473 F.3d 1334, 1336 n.1 (10th Cir. 2007) (using and defining the word “hermaphrodite”); In re Est. of Gardiner, 22 P.3d 1086, 1097 (2001) (using the word “hermaphrodites”). 33.

The last three of these traits are arguably more related to gender than to sex, reflecting the fact that some definitions of sex incorporate gender within them. As social constructs, the division between sex and gender are blurry and can change based on context. 35.

They refer to people who are primarily attracted to individuals of the same sex, in the case of gay and lesbian people, or to people of the same sex and another sex, in the case of bisexual people.45 People who are gay or lesbian can collectively be referred to as “homosexual.”46 Many other sexual orientations exist beyond gay, lesbian, and bisexual,47 but these three are the sexual orientations named in “LGBTQ+” and therefore are the most well-known. The T of LGBTQ+ refers to transgender, or simply “trans,” people. “Transgender” describes a gender identity and typically refers to people who do not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.48 In contrast, people who do identify with the sex they were assigned at birth are called cisgender.49 As mentioned above, some people are “nonbinary” or “gender non-conforming” and do not identify with either of the binary male or female sex categories.50 Science has not identified any reliable physical predictor of sexual orientation or gender identity, although some studies have identified correlations between neurobiology and queer identities.51 Ultimately, an individual self-assigns their gender identity and sexual orientation based on their feelings, self-knowledge, and their understanding of human possibilities.52 People with intersex traits do not always fit neatly into the LGBTQ+  45.

Intersex people are not well-understood in U.S. culture and many people in the United States assume intersex people are part of the LGBTQ+ community described above.53 However, while some intersex people consider themselves to be LGBTQ+ because of their intersex traits, others do not.54 While most queer identities are self-assigned, third parties, such as medical personnel, usually identify an individual as intersex.55 Most intersex people are additionally assigned “male” or “female” at birth and are raised as one of these binary genders.56 Intersex traits do not predict a person’s sexual orientation nor do they predict gender identity.57 Some intersex people feel comfortable in the gender assigned to them at birth, while others may prefer association with a different gender.58 Cultures incorporate intersex people, and other sex and gender minorities, into society in different ways. Cultures in the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Polynesia/Pacific Islands, Native America, Ancient Israel, and India all recognize a third sex, which includes intersex people, trans people, or both.59 While some cultures develop distinct “third sex” gender roles, others incorporate people with sex and gender differences into either male or female social roles.60 For example, in Samoa, Fa’afafine and Fa’afatama are third and fourth genders with distinct social roles.61 The special roles of Fa’afafine and Fa’afatama people include caring for elderly relatives and speaking frankly about taboo topics such as sexual health.62 In contrast, the culture of seventeenth century England recognized a third sex, but incorporated these individuals into either male or female social roles.63 The renowned jurist Lorde Coke explained that every person is “either a male, or female, or an hermaphrodite [sic]” and that, under English law, intersex people would take either a male or female legal status depending on which  53.

Intersex people also face challenges that are distinct from those faced by LGBTQ+ groups. C. Challenges Intersex People Face  Although intersex traits occur naturally and have existed as long as humans have, there is less awareness and advocacy around intersex people than many other sexual or gender minorities.65 While gay and trans activism in the United States was in full swing by the 1970s,66 intersex organizing and activism did not begin until the 1990s, with the founding of the now-defunct Intersex Society of North America.67 These divergent timelines likely result from multiple factors. Intersex traits vary and many can remain undetected without genomic or other medical testing.68 This means that people with intersex traits can go their whole lives without knowing they have a non-standard chromosome combination or internal organs atypical of their assigned sex.69 Another important challenge is the prevalence of infant sex assignment surgery. Infant sex assignment surgeries are cosmetic surgeries performed on infants born with ambiguous genitalia.70 The practice became standard in the United States in the 1960s, and aimed to help intersex children fit into typical male or female sex and gender roles.71 However, the  64.

II. THE UNCERTAIN LEGAL STATUS OF INTERSEX PEOPLE IN THE CONTEXT OF SEX AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION LAW While a few states define intersex people as a protected class,83 no such laws exist at the federal level. Likewise, courts disagree as to whether anti-discrimination laws recognizing “sex” or “gender” as protected classes also protect intersex people.84 Section A of this Part reviews current intersex jurisprudence, surveying court decisions that decided whether “intersex” describes a sex, gender, or neither, in various legal contexts. Section B examines the history and evolution of one federal anti-discrimination law in particular, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”). Section C outlines recent developments in Title VII jurisprudence brought about by the Supreme Court’s landmark decision Bostock v. Clayton County. A. Current Intersex Jurisprudence While intersex jurisprudence remains underdeveloped in comparison to jurisprudence on many LGBTQ+ identities,85 a handful of federal court cases speak to the legal status of intersex people. In lieu of a Supreme Court decision clarifying the status of intersex people with respect to sex or gender discrimination, these lower courts offer guidance. Several courts hold or imply that “intersex” describes a sex or a gender. In Zzyym v. Pompeo,86 the Tenth Circuit assumed that “intersex” describes a sex. The plaintiff, Zzyym, was denied a passport after submitting an application in which they identified “intersex” as their sex.87 Although the case did not explicitly address whether “intersex” describes a sex, the court implicitly accepted this premise in finding that “intersex” more accurately described Zzyym’s sex than “male” or “female.”88  83. See, e.g., N.J. STAT. § 26:2H-12.101 (2021), CAL. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 150900 (2021) (including intersex people as a protected class under state anti-discrimination laws). 84.

Home Depot, Inc.,89 a district court in New Jersey held that harassment of an intersex employee qualified as harassment on the basis of gender under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination.90 The court reasoned that the intersex plaintiff suffered harassment because of her gender: she was referred to as “it,” encountered the derogatory term “faggot” written on her locker, and found the phrase “we don’t need your kind here, go home” written on her car.91 While the holding makes clear that the harassment was on the basis of gender, the court does not explain why it considered this intersex plaintiff to be covered by a law prohibiting gender discrimination. In another workplace discrimination case, Johnson v. Fresh Mark, Inc.,92 a district court in Ohio suggested in dicta that if the transgender plaintiff was fired for being intersex rather than transgender, her Title VII claim may have been on stronger footing.93 Because Title VII prohibits discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sex,94 this court entertained the idea that “intersex” might describe a sex for the purposes of a Title VII claim.95 However, other courts have declined to recognize intersex as a sex or a gender or have otherwise limited protections for intersex people as a protected class. In DiMarco v. Wyoming,96 the district court in Wyoming held that the plaintiff, who was “born with ambiguous gender” (i.e., was an intersex person), did not experience discrimination based on sex for the purpose of their Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim.97 Rather, the court only analyzed whether there was evidence that intersex people, as a group, were “subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment.”98 By not considering intersex people to be included under the protected class of sex, the court implied that intersex discrimination is distinct from sex discrimination. Finally, in Woods v. C.G. Studios, Inc.,99 a district court in Pennsylvania held that the definition of “sex” in a Pennsylvanian  89. 804 F. Supp. 2d 223 (D.N.J. 2011). 90. Id. at 227. 91.

B. Title VII Jurisprudence Before Bostock v. Clayton County Title VII is a federal anti-discrimination statute that prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on any of five protected characteristics: race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.102 Title VII applies to all U.S. employers with fifteen or more employees, and to employers who are federal, state, or local governments.103 The relevant portion of the law prohibits discrimination “against any individual . . . because of such individual’s . . . sex.”104 Title VII itself does not define “sex,” nor does the statute’s legislative history shed light on what definition of “sex” the legislature intended.105 Famously, a U.S. Representative named Howard Smith who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 added the word “sex” to the text of the bill shortly before it went before the House floor for a vote.106 He seemingly believed that the addition would doom the entire bill.107 Instead, the bill passed and became law.108 Since the Act’s passage, Title VII’s reach has been expanded by both Congress and the courts. For example, in 1978 Congress defined “sex” to include “pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.”109 A few years later, in 1986, the Supreme Court held that Title VII extends  100.

For example, in EEOC v. Boh Bros. Construction Co.,112 an employee suffered sexual harassment at work from a co-worker who perceived him to be insufficiently “manly.”113 The court’s inquiry into whether the harassment was because of sex did not hinge on the plaintiff’s gender presentation (i.e., the court did not determine whether the employee was actually unmanly).114 Rather, the court focused on the “alleged harasser’s subjective perception of the victim.”115 The court stated that discrimination based on “wrong or ill-informed assumptions” about an employee can trigger Title VII protections.116 The Fifth Circuit has held that Title VII protection based on ill-informed assumptions about an individual also applies to sex discrimination against women117 and discrimination on the basis of national origin.118 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces Title VII claims for the federal government,119 also codifies this theory in its internal guidelines.120 In the context of race discrimination under Title VII, the EEOC guidelines state that “[d]iscrimination against  110.

City of Cincinnati,125 the Sixth Circuit held that a police department’s stated reason for firing a transgender woman—her lack of a “command presence”—improperly relied on subjective sex stereotypes about masculinity and therefore violated Title VII.126 Although individual LGBTQ+ plaintiffs have brought successful Title VII claims under these theories, their inclusion under Title VII was not guaranteed. Until 2017, no court categorically extended Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination “because of . . . sex” to people discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation (e.g., being gay, lesbian, or bisexual) or gender identity (e.g., being transgender or nonbinary).127 In 2019, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case  121.

Clayton County The 2020 landmark Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County expanded legal protections for gay, lesbian, and transgender people.129 Specifically, the Court held that individuals who are discriminated against for being homosexual or transgender can seek protection and a remedy under Title VII using its prohibition on sex discrimination.130 To the surprise of Supreme Court commentators and the LGBTQ+ community,131 Justice Gorsuch—a Trump appointee and judicial conservative132—authored the majority opinion. Justice Gorsuch is understood to be a “textualist,” meaning he believes the Court should narrowly look to the “text, structure, and history” of a statute to decide its proper meaning.133 Accordingly, the opinion he authored in Bostock relies heavily on the meaning of the word “sex” at the time Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the specific legal meaning of the phrase “because of,” and the logical inferences one must draw when putting these pieces of the statute together.134 1. The Bostock Court’s Narrow Definition of “Sex” To conduct its analysis, the Bostock Court adopted, arguendo, a narrow definition of sex: “status as either male or female [as] determined by reproductive biology.”135 The Court acknowledged that this definition was exceedingly narrow, and that even in 1964, the definition of sex captured “more than anatomy and reach[ed] at least some norms concerning gender  128.

The text of Title VII does not include the words “sexual orientation,” “gender identity,” “transgender,” or “homosexual,” so the Court did not attempt to define these terms, nor did the Court hinge its analysis on those definitions.140 Equipped with its definition of sex, the Bostock Court held that discriminating against a person for being homosexual or transgender must involve discriminating against that person on the basis of sex.141 This is because firing an employee for being attracted to members of the same sex (in the case of homosexuals) requires the employer to take into account the employee’s sex.142 Likewise, firing someone for being transgender requires an employer to take into account whatever sex the employee was assigned at birth.143 Because the employee’s sex is one of the elements relevant to the employer’s decision to terminate in either of these scenarios, the discrimination is based on sex. The Court then explained that Title VII carries a “but for” causation standard,144 meaning the law is violated any time an employee’s sex is a contributing factor in the decision to fire them, even if it is not the only, or even the primary, factor.145 Although the employer in these cases may also consider factors other than sex—an employee’s gender identity or their sexual orientation—this does not obviate the fact that the employer relied on sex as a factor in their decision to fire an employee.146 Bostock, therefore,  136.

The Court’s opinion in Bostock did not supply a singular test to guide future courts encountering different fact patterns. Rather, the Court asks readers to “imagine” different scenarios to illustrate that an individual’s sex is always one but-for cause of discrimination when a person is fired for being transgender or homosexual.147 Future courts attempting to apply Title VII to slightly different factual circumstances are likely to rely on these “simple test[s]” that the Court presented throughout the text of its opinion.148 Many of these tests assume or invoke a sex and gender binary, complicating the Title VII analysis for non-binary plaintiffs.   2. The Bostock Court’s Use of the Gender Binary Several of the Bostock Court’s tests explicitly invoke the gender binary or require courts to imagine the plaintiff as the other sex to determine whether sex was a relevant factor in the discrimination. For example, the Bostock Court imagined a scenario where an employer has a policy of firing known homosexual employees: The employer hosts an office holiday party and invites employees to bring their spouses. A model employee arrives and introduces a manager to Susan, the employee’s wife. Will that employee be fired? If the policy works as the employer intends, the answer depends entirely on whether the model employee is a man or a woman.149 Likewise, the Court invoked a binary idea of sex when stating the test for a triable Title VII claim. A triable claim exists when a plaintiff alleges “that the harassment would not have taken place but for his sex—that is, the plaintiff would not have suffered similar treatment if he were female.”150 In a different section, the Court used the phrase “men and women” to describe the “employees” who may be affected by employment discrimination, making no mention of additional possible sex categories.151 In other parts of the opinion, the Court did not explicitly invoke the sex  147.

Furthermore, the Court used the word “sex,” without supplying binary choices. For example, the Court stated that an employer triggers Title VII if they “intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex”152 or if they “necessarily and intentionally appl[y] sex-based rules.”153 Similarly, the Court stated that an employer’s policy violated Title VII when it “could not ‘pass the simple test’ asking whether an individual female employee would have been treated the same regardless of her sex.”154 Further, the Court acknowledged Title VII’s expansion over the years to reach scenarios other than those originally contemplated by the legislators who passed the law, affirming that “[a]s enacted, Title VII prohibits all forms of discrimination because of sex, however they may manifest themselves or whatever other labels might attach to them.”155 The Court also addressed a counter-argument that sexual orientation and gender identity characteristics exist separately and distinctly from sex.156 The Court rebutted this argument with a hypothetical in which an anonymous job applicant fills out an application form that asks for their sexual orientation and gender identity.157 The Court reasoned that it is impossible to define the words homosexual or transgender “without using the words man, woman, or sex (or some synonym)”; therefore, there is “no way an employer can discriminate against those who check the homosexual or transgender box without discriminating in part because of an applicant’s sex.”158 This sets up yet another test for whether sex is a but for cause of an employment decision: can the identity discriminated against be described without using the word sex, man, woman, or some synonym? Finally, to illustrate why discrimination against transgender people is also “because of sex,” the Court posed another hypothetical: [A]n employer [] fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female. If the employer retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth, the employer intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in  152.

The dissenters, also purported textualists,161 proposed a different test: “[h]ow would the terms of a statute have been understood by ordinary people at the time of enactment?”162 The dissenters included an appendix that provides dictionary definitions contemporary to the passage of Title VII.163 It also catalogues uses and definitions of the word “sex” from 1382 to 2011.164 While most definitions restrict sex to “one of two divisions of . . . human beings,”165 or similar language, the 1964 Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English defines sex as “being male or female or hermaphrodite.”166 Further, the word “intersex” appears under the definition of “sex” in both the 1966 and 2002 editions of Webster’s Third New International Dictionary.167 In both cases, the word follows a more scientific definition of sex, describing “the sum of the morphological, physiological, and behavioral peculiarities of living beings that subserves biparental reproduction . . . ” and includes “intersex” as a related term.168 Although the Court’s decision in Bostock was celebrated for unequivocally expanding Title VII protections to more LGBTQ+ people, the Court’s holding is explicitly narrow. The Court stated that its decision in Bostock only bears on whether “an employer can fire someone for being homosexual or transgender” under Title VII.169 The Court’s holding, therefore, does not make clear Bostock’s effect on the rights of unnamed sex or gender minorities such as nonbinary people, asexual people, bisexual people, or intersex people.

III. INTERSEX PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED UNDER TITLE VII AFTER BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY Although the legal status of intersex people under Title VII is currently undecided, this Part demonstrates why courts considering the issue should find that intersex people have a cognizable Title VII claim. Section A demonstrates that Title VII categorically covers intersex people because intersex discrimination involves discrimination on the basis of sex traits. Because all intersex people have a natural variation in a sex trait, discrimination against intersex people is always discrimination because of sex. Section B then turns to other possibilities for including intersex people under Title VII. It concludes that, although these avenues provide some coverage, the sex trait theory detailed in section A is the most straightforward path to Title VII relief for intersex plaintiffs. A. Discrimination Against Intersex People Is Discrimination on the Basis of Sex Traits Courts considering whether Title VII protects intersex people must find that discrimination against intersex people is discrimination on the basis of sex traits. Therefore, Title VII’s plain language covers intersex people. Both the Bostock court’s definition of “sex” and definitions in other contexts support this interpretation.170 Despite its use of sex- and gender-binary language, Bostock does not preclude courts from finding that Title VII prohibits discrimination against intersex people. Finally, all recent court cases involving intersex people assume that sex or gender categories include intersex people, while older cases are less conclusive. Overall, intersex people should be categorically included under Title VII after Bostock because the Bostock Court’s definition of sex includes intersex people.  1. Many Definitions of “Sex” Include Intersex Traits Intersex people are included under the Bostock Court’s definition of sex. Additionally, executive branch definitions of “sex,”171 definitions  170.

The Bostock Court defined sex as “status as either male or female [as] determined by reproductive biology.”175 This definition, on its face, does not include intersex people and explicitly credits the sex binary, mentioning “male” and “female” as the only options for a person’s sex.176 However, in the next paragraph, the Court states the definition in a different way, saying that sex refers “only to biological distinctions between male and female.”177 This restated definition includes intersex people. “Biological distinctions between male and female” refers to traits that are used to determine sex, also known as sex traits.178 The Bostock Court does not state what it considers to be relevant “distinctions” between males and females. However, medical experts179 and courts180 define up to nine different categories of sex traits: chromosomal sex, gonadal sex (reproductive sex glands, i.e., testes or ovaries), internal morphological sex (e.g., seminal vesicles, prostate, vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes), external morphological sex (genitalia), hormonal sex, phenotypic sex (i.e., secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair or breasts), assigned sex, gender of rearing, and gender identity.181 Discriminating on the basis of these “distinctions between male and female” is sex discrimination under the Bostock Court’s definition. For example, a hypothetical employer who bases hiring decisions on a secondary sex characteristic—say, the size of a woman’s breasts—discriminates on the basis of sex because their decision is based on a trait that is a “distinction” between males and females.182 Likewise, a hypothetical employer who has a policy of firing anyone with a certain external morphological sex—say, anyone who has a penis—also violates Title VII. Because the decision is based on a sex trait, it is based on sex. Although examples involving chromosomal sex,  172. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1789. 173. See supra section I.B. 174.

Under the Bostock Court’s definition of sex, intersex people are categorically covered under Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination. The list of nine sex trait categories is expansive, and the last two elements, gender of rearing and gender identity, arguably describe gender rather than sex.184 However, this does not disrupt the analysis of intersex people’s Title VII claims for two reasons. First, all intersex people have a variation in at least one of the first six indisputably “sex-like” elements.185 Second, courts interpreting Title VII fail to distinguish between sex and gender.186 Therefore, even variations in traits that may be more aligned with gender than sex should not defeat a person’s sex discrimination claim. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice recently adopted an interpretation of “sex” based on sex traits that includes intersex people. In March 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it will interpret “sex discrimination” to include discrimination against intersex people when implementing statutes such as the Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Crime Act.187 The agency cites Bostock for this change and indicates that “sex traits” are relevant to its reasoning: discrimination against intersex people “is based on variations in biological sex traits,” therefore being intersex is “inextricably bound up with sex.”188 The agency believes “sex” should be interpreted to include intersex people.189 In addition to the definition of sex used by the majority in Bostock, definitions supplied by the Bostock dissenters also support the idea that intersex people should be included under Title VII.190 One dictionary definition included in Bostock’s appendix defines sex as “being male or female or hermaphrodite.”191 This definition, from the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English of 1964, is contemporary to the passage of  183.

Two additional dictionary definitions supplied by the dissent include the word intersex under the general definition of sex, as a related term.194 It is true that many dictionaries in 1964 and many contemporary dictionaries fail to include “intersex” under their definition of sex.195 However, given the widespread lack of awareness about intersex people,196 and the persistent tendency to think of sex in binary terms (despite evidence that sex and gender are not strict binaries),197 it is reasonable to understand the failure to include intersex people as a result of ignorance, rather than intentional exclusion. Courts deciding whether intersex people are covered under Title VII will focus explicitly on intersex people in their analysis and need not overlook and exclude intersex people simply because the larger culture has. Additionally, it is not necessary for intersex to be considered a third sex for courts to recognize that intersex traits are sex traits.198 Therefore, even dictionary definitions that define sex as being “male” or “female” do not detract from the conclusion that intersex discrimination is sex discrimination. Aside from dictionary definitions, some historical sources include a third sex category or acknowledge that intersex people exist. There is evidence that early English law defined “intersex” as a sex, with one renowned 16th century jurist listing “hermaphrodite” alongside male and female as the three potential sexes of an heir.199 While English society was structured around only two sexes and instructed intersex people to be placed into the binary sex category where they fit best, the law nonetheless identified intersex as an alternative to having “male” or “female” sex.200 Finally, in the United States, there is no definitive legal definition of sex that is consistent across states and agencies.201 The most authoritative  192.

Furthermore, in some U.S. jurisdictions it is now possible to list “intersex” as a person’s sex on a birth certificate.205 If a person has “intersex” listed on their birth certificate as their legal sex, and they are discriminated against on this basis, the discrimination is unquestionably “because of sex” under Title VII. 2. Intersex People Are Not Excluded Under Bostock’s Reasoning The Bostock opinion can be read to include intersex people. While the Court clearly references the sex and gender binary throughout its opinion, it also includes several examples that can be read to apply to any number of sexes. Future courts finding that Title VII protects intersex people will be able to square that decision with Bostock, even though intersex people are not mentioned in the opinion. Several of the rule statements in Bostock can be read to include intersex people. For example, the Court states that an employer’s action triggers Title VII if the employer “intentionally treat[s] individual employees differently because of their sex.”206 This rule does not limit the choices of sex to “male” or “female” and accommodates an interpretation of “sex discrimination” that includes “sex trait discrimination.” Likewise, the Court states that an employer violates Title VII when they “necessarily and intentionally appl[y] sex-based rules.”207 Hiring, firing, or treating  202.

Additionally, the Court points out that it is impossible to define homosexual or transgender “without using the words man, woman, or sex (or some synonym).”210 This sets up another test: if an identity cannot be described without using these words, discrimination against that group involves discrimination on the basis of sex.211 Applying this test to intersex people, it is clear that one cannot define the term “intersex” without using the words man, woman, sex, or some synonym.212 Dictionaries defining intersex all use the terms male, female, and sex,213 and it is not possible to do otherwise. Indeed, the word intersex includes the word “sex” within it. Thus, under the Court’s logic, it is impossible to consider whether someone is intersex for purposes of an employment decision without considering that person’s sex. Additionally, the sex-binary hypotheticals posed in Bostock can be understood as illustrative examples that use the most common sexes—male and female—rather than exclusive examples prohibiting intersex people from accessing Title VII’s protections. To explain its holding in Bostock, the Court uses a series of examples and tests to illustrate that discrimination against gay people and transgender people is because of sex.214 If these examples are taken to be exclusive, then in several parts of the opinion the only sex options available are “men and women.”215 However, they can also be read—and are more properly understood—as non-exclusive examples using the most common sexes. For example, in a hypothetical involving an office party, the decision to fire a model employee for being gay depends on “whether the model employee is a  208. Id. 209. Id. at 1747. 210.

While it seems that the Court in Bostock did not intend to include intersex people in its holding, the Court’s definition of sex includes people with intersex traits. Further, the Court’s uncritical acceptance of a sex binary does not preclude intersex people’s inclusion under Title VII. Therefore, future courts determining the issue can decide that intersex people are included under Title VII without contradicting Bostock. 3. The Recent Trend Is for Courts to Understand Intersex Discrimination as Sex Discrimination As previously discussed, some courts have declined to find that discrimination against intersex people is on account of sex.217 However, courts deciding the issue most recently assume that intersex traits do implicate sex.218 This reflects a shift towards greater understanding and awareness around sex and gender minorities. Given the relative youth of the intersex rights movements and continuing lack of awareness about intersex issues,219 this pattern is not surprising. Because no court has ever ruled on whether Title VII specifically includes intersex people, a case begging this question will be a case of first impression for any judge who considers it. Future courts deciding whether intersex is a sex should continue the recent trend of recognizing discrimination against intersex people as discrimination on the basis of sex. The most recent case involving an intersex plaintiff, Zzyym v. Pompeo, treats “intersex” as a sex category that corresponds to the plaintiff’s nonbinary gender identity on the plaintiff’s passport.220 The Tenth Circuit does not discuss its reasoning for including intersex as a sex. However, it states that “intersex” would be a more accurate sex designation than “male” or “female” for the plaintiff,221 who is an intersex person born with ambiguous genitalia, was raised male, lived for a period as female, and who now lives as a nonbinary person.222 Another case, Hughes v.

In DiMarco v. Wyoming,226 decided in 2004, the court chose not to apply heightened scrutiny to an intersex person’s Equal Protection claim.227 The court did not explicitly state that discrimination against intersex people is not discrimination on the basis of sex; however, the plaintiff did not argue this point and the court failed to consider the issue on its own.228 Johnson v. Fresh Mark, Inc.,229 decided in 2003, was also equivocal about whether intersex is considered a sex.230 While the question before the court was whether a transgender person was covered under Title VII based on a sex stereotyping claim, the court seemed to suggest that the plaintiff may have had a stronger Title VII claim if she had proven she was intersex.231 Finally, an anti-discrimination case decided in 1987, Wood v. C.G. Studios, Inc.,232 did explicitly hold that discrimination against an intersex person was not on the basis of sex under a Pennsylvania statute.233 Although case law is not unanimous, judges considering the question more recently find that intersex people are included under statutes implicating “sex” or “gender.” Future courts considering the question in a Title VII context are free to follow the modern trend and decide that intersex people qualify for protections on account of sex under Title VII.

The Sex Stereotyping Theory Is Likely to Exclude Some Intersex Plaintiffs Under the sex stereotyping theory, plaintiffs have a valid Title VII claim when they are discriminated against for failing to conform to traditional sex stereotypes.236 Intersex people, by definition, have traits that fail to conform to sex stereotypes.237 Specifically, they have physical traits thought to be incongruent with either binary sex.238 Therefore, intersex people may have a cognizable Title VII claim if they are fired because they fail to conform to social expectations of what it means to be a “man” or a “woman” (i.e., because they are intersex). One challenge to using the sex stereotype theory is that courts tend to interpret sex stereotyping claims as relating to behavior or appearance.239 While some intersex people may be visibly gender non-conforming, others fail to conform to sex stereotypes in ways that are undetectable to an employer who does not have access to the employee’s medical records. For example, people with Turner Syndrome have an XX genotype, except that one of their X chromosomes is missing or partially missing.240 This can cause them to diverge from “normal” female development by, for example, starting puberty late or not at all, ending menstruation early in life, or being infertile.241 Most people with Turner Syndrome identify as  234.

Because past cases about sex stereotyping hinged on gendered behavior and appearance,243 an intersex plaintiff with less-detectable intersex traits is unlikely to prevail on a sex stereotyping claim. One article proposes a variation on the sex stereotyping theory that would fill this gap, called the “anatomical nonconformity” theory.244 This theory posits that courts should recognize a cause of action for intersex plaintiffs “for discrimination based on anatomical nonconformity—that is, the failure for a person’s anatomical sex to conform to societal expectations for their gender.”245 The article points out that the Supreme Court in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.246 held that “Title VII’s protections should extend to prohibit all discrimination ‘reasonably comparable’ to the principal evil that it textually prohibits.”247 Because sex stereotyping is reasonably comparable to anatomical nonconformity, intersex plaintiffs should have a cause of action under Title VII.248 This argument, though well-reasoned, was proposed before Bostock was decided. After the Bostock Court defined sex as “biological distinctions between male and female,”249 the sex trait discrimination theory proposed in this Comment provides a more direct path to Title VII coverage for intersex people. 2. Classifying Intersex People as a Third Sex Has Many Drawbacks Another option for intersex inclusion under Title VII is to understand intersex as a third sex category.250 This interpretation is well supported, as definitions in early English law and some contemporary to Title VII’s passage included “intersex” as a sex category alongside “male” and “female.”251 However, defining intersex as a third sex category has several drawbacks. First, many intersex people do not consider their sex to be  242. Ilana Gelfman, Because of Intersex: Intersexuality, Title VII, and the Reality of Discrimination “Because of . . .

The “Perceived Sex” Theory Is Difficult to Implement Analyzing Title VII claims based on a person’s perceived sex would include many intersex people but would be difficult for courts to implement consistently. One scholar argues that Title VII sex discrimination cases should be governed by a “perceived sex” test.261 If an employer discriminates against an employee based on their perception of the employee’s sex, they violate Title VII.262 Likewise, they violate Title VII if their perception of an employee’s gender assignment is at odds with their perception of the employee’s gender expression.263 This test has  252.

Finding discrimination based on perceived sex also reflects how discrimination actually operates and is a principle already reflected in Title VII case law.264 This test also incorporates the possibility that intersex may be perceived as a third sex category by some employers (who may discriminate on that basis) without requiring a court to recognize intersex as a third sex category by law. However, the downside to this test is that it requires courts to become quite savvy with the difference between gender assignment, gender expression, and gender identity, which is not an area in which courts have historically shown sophistication.265 While the perceived sex doctrine may have been a promising way to include intersex and transgender plaintiffs under Title VII pre-Bostock, transgender plaintiffs are now explicitly covered under Title VII using the plain meaning of the word “sex.”266 The “sex trait” discrimination theory covers intersex people in a similarly straightforward way. CONCLUSION Although intersex people are often left out of discussions about sex discrimination, courts considering the issue will find that intersex people have a clear path to coverage under Title VII. This is because Bostock’s definition of sex makes clear that discrimination on the basis of sex traits is discrimination on the basis of sex. Because intersex people always have a natural variation in a sex trait, intersex people are therefore always covered under Title VII. While there are alternative paths to Title VII coverage for intersex plaintiffs, recognizing that sex discrimination encompasses sex trait discrimination is the most comprehensive and straightforward path to Title VII protections. While recognizing employment rights for intersex people is important in itself, greater acknowledgement of intersex people, including by courts, is also important for other sex and gender minorities. Many popular representations of transgender people still implicate a gender binary that reinforces an understanding of sex and gender that is simply not true for many people. The gender binary suggests that there are only two options, and that every person is either one or the other. Acknowledging the reality of not only a range of possible genders, but a wide range of sex traits—a  264. See supra section II.B.1. 265.

    "abstract": "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from workplace discrimination and harassment on account of sex. Courts have historically failed to extend Title VII protections to LGBTQ+ people. However, in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County changed this. Bostock explicitly extended Title VII’s protections against workplace discrimination to “homosexual” and “transgender” people, reasoning that it is impossible to discriminate against an employee for being gay or transgender without taking the employee’s sex into account. While Bostock is a win for LGBTQ+ rights, the opinion leaves several questions unanswered. The reasoning in Bostock heavily implies the existence of a sex and gender binary, and the Court names only two groups—transgender and homosexual people—for protection. Therefore, it remains unclear whether people who fall outside of the sex or gender binary are protected under Title VII.\nThis Comment focuses on one non-binary group, intersex people, and asks whether Title VII covers intersex people after Bostock. This Comment starts by defining the term intersex and exploring the cultural and legal context of intersex people in the United States. It then turns to Title VII, detailing Title VII’s history and the Court’s reasoning in Bostock v. Clayton County. This Comment concludes that Title VII covers intersex people after Bostock because the Court’s definition of sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of sex traits. Because all intersex people have a natural variation in at least one sex trait (i.e., a trait that humans use to determine sex), Title VII categorically covers intersex people after Bostock",
