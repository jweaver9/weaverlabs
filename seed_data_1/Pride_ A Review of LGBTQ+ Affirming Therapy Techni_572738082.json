As more and more LGBTQ+ people sought out therapeutic services, psychological research in the field of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy began to develop in order to meet these needs. Although the number of articles and studies conducted in this field has grown exponentially since the start of the 21st century, a sizeable gap between research and application remains. Research often provides vague suggestions without discussing specific clinical recommendations. Until discussion shifts to emphasize the practical aspect of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, the mental health needs of this large and diverse group of people will not be met. Therefore, the major goal of this project is to review the intersection of mental health and LGBTQ+ people over time and conclude with specific recommendations for providing LGBTQ+ affirmative care across a variety of presenting concerns and treatment settings. It is worth noting that LGBTQ+ affirming therapy is not a specific theoretical orientation or form of treatment on its own. Rather, it is a way of providing therapeutic treatment that takes into consideration the history of LGBTQ+ individuals, the impact of intersectionality, unique individual experiences, and affirms that nobody is less than anybody else, regardless of their sexual identity and/or gender identity. The cultural identities of our clients should be praised, encouraged, and used to inform how we provide mental health services. These conditions represent the heart of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, which has the potential to have a significant positive impact on countless individuals who need our help as clinicians.   6 Dedication This project is dedicated first and foremost to my late father, Doug Lemon, for the love, care, and knowledge he provided me with in my personal, academic, and professional lives. I would never have such a strong passion for using psychology to help others without him, and the impact he had on the lives of myself, his family, his loved ones, and his clients leave a legacy that I will always cherish. I would also like to dedicate this to my mother, Andrea Lemon, for being a constant source of love and support through every challenge and reward that I have encountered. Additionally, I would like to thank my partner Blake, siblings Hayley and Clark, grandmother Sheila, and best friend Laura who have continued to support and love me from day one. Next, I simply would not be here without my incredible cohort within EKU’s Psy.D. program. Angie, Colbey, Gabby, Hogan, Mattie Helen, Megan, Mera, Molly, Myresha, Regan, and Taylor, thank you for loving and supporting me through the most challenging and exciting time of my life! Finally, I would like to thank all of the amazing teachers, professors, and supervisors that I have worked with in my academic career. Your inspiration, support, constructive criticism, and knowledge are the sole reason why I still have such an intense love of learning!          7 Table of Contents Title Page…………………………………………………………………...…….1 Abstract……………………………………………………………………...……5 Dedication…………………………………………………………………...……6 Table of Contents…………………………………………………………...…….7 Section I: Introduction……………………………………………………………….…...9  Introduction of the Topic………………………………………………....9  Definition of the Problem………………………………………..………10  Statement of Significance………………………………………..………10  Purpose…………………………………………………………..……….11 Section II: Literature Review & Conversion Therapy..………………..………...13  Method of Conducting Literature Review………………………….……13  History of Conversion Therapy…………………………………...……..13  Effects of Conversion Therapy…………………………………………..16  Methodological Analysis of Conversion Therapy Research Studies…….21  The Ex-Gay Movement………………………………………………….24  Institutionalized & Internalized Homophobia………………...…………27  LGBTQ+ Emotional & Psychological Health………………..…………30 Section III: LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy………………………………………33  Introduction to LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy………………………..…33  Importance of Clinician Training in LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy.……46  Affirming Therapy in the Coming Out Process……………………...…49  Role of Intersectionality in LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy…………...…55   8  Minority Stress Model & Resilience …………………….………....…..60 Discussion……………………………………………………..…………..……64 References………………………………………………………………………68 Appendix………………………………………………………………………..87  Appendix A: Resources for LGBTQ+ Clients………………………….87  Appendix B: Recommendations for Using Affirming Therapy in Clinical                  Practice……………………………………………...…………………..89  Appendix C: Glossary…………………………………………………..96                    9 I.  Introduction Introduction of the Topic  The LGBTQ+ community has a centuries-long history of facing discrimination, prejudice, victimization, and incarceration across the world. Only in the past few decades have LGBTQ+ individuals received increased legal protections and the right to marriage across much of the developed world. During this period of time, there has also been a significant increase in support from non-LGBTQ+ people across the world. However, these positive changes do not erase the significant difficulties that LGBTQ+ individuals experience in all areas of their lives, including academic, social, occupational, familial, emotional, and physical functioning (Godfrey et al., 2006). In fact, Gender and Sexual Minority (GSM) people are significantly more likely to seek out mental health treatment than heterosexual and cisgender individuals (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). Exacerbating their mental health concerns is the fact that many GSM individuals encounter significant barriers to seeking and receiving treatment of their emotional, mental, and physical health (Smalley et al., 2018). These barriers exist at the individual, environmental, and systemic levels. Individual barriers include discrimination in health care, lack of comprehensive health coverage, lack of information about available services, negative past experiences, and beliefs that clinicians will be homo/transphobic (Ross et al., 2007; Smalley et al., 2018). At the environmental level, GSM individuals experience a lack of legal nondiscrimination protections at the local, state, and federal levels and also do not see themselves represented in clinical spaces, be it in clinician materials or in a lack of neutral bathroom spaces (Smalley et al., 2018). Systemically, LGBTQ+ individuals often encounter a lack of competent clinicians, resources, research, and data (Smalley et al.,   10 2018). As a result of these struggles and barriers, it is crucial that mental health providers actively work to solve these problems and provide competent and affirming care to their LGBTQ+ clients through every step of the therapeutic process.  Definition of the Problem  Since the LGBTQ+ community experiences mental health concerns and seeks out mental health care at significantly higher rates than heterosexual and cisgender individuals (Cochran, 2001; Cooley, 1998; Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017), it is imperative that mental health clinicians receive training and education that allows them to serve their GSM clients in a competent, supportive, and caring way. In addition to lack of competency, a major barrier to seeking mental health services is the fact that the field of mental health has a long history of harming and shaming LGBTQ+ individuals by pathologizing and attempting to convert their minority sexual identities (Clarke et al., 2010; Davies & Neal, 1996; Shidlo & Gonsiorek, 2017). In addition to emphasizing LGBTQ+ education within training programs, it is essential to provide clinicians with specific recommendations so they can implement LGBTQ+ affirming therapy into their clinical work with ALL clients. If these conditions are met, the end goal of reducing mental health symptoms and improving overall quality of life for GSM people can be achieved.  Statement of Significance  Learning to work effectively with LGBTQ+ clients is crucial to being a well-rounded, multiculturally-informed, and ethically sound clinician. One’s ability to work well with LGBTQ+ clients is significant (American Psychological Association; APA, 2009). A study conducted by the APA (2009) found that out of over 2,500 clinicians who   11 were surveyed, 99% reported working with at least one LGBTQ+ client during their careers. In addition, LGBTQ+ individuals have a distinct culture and their own unique strengths and challenges as a result of their lived experiences (APA, 2009). LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to endorse symptoms of psychological distress and are more likely to seek out therapeutic services than heterosexual and cisgender individuals (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). In addition, LGBTQ+ individuals deal with life stressors and social stigma that heterosexual and cisgender individuals do not, including living in a homophobic society, coming out to loved ones, difficulties in adopting children, and a lack of religious and familial support (Godfrey et al., 2006).   Even if clients are motivated and able to seek out therapeutic services, they often experience discrimination, invalidation, and homophobia when working with clinicians. Nystrom (1997) found that 46% of LGBTQ+ clients had worked with homophobic clinicians and 34% had worked with clinicians who refused to acknowledge their LGBTQ+ identities as legitimate. Finally, the current project is significant because it is one of few (if not the only) project that directly discusses conversion therapy, LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, intersectionality as it pertains to LGBTQ+ individuals, the importance of clinician training, the process of coming out, and that provides clear recommendations for utilizing LGBTQ+ affirming therapy in clinical practice.  Purpose  The first purpose of the current project is to discuss the history of LGBTQ+ mental health treatment in order to establish context and the need for LGBTQ+ affirming care. This begins with a history of conversion therapy and a discussion of its effects and early research studies that praised its importance and efficacy. Another purpose is to   12 provide an overview of what LGBTQ+ affirming therapy is, what it means at a theoretical level, how intersectionality plays a role in it, how minority stress impacts LGBTQ+ mental health, and ways that it can be used in working with clients through the coming out process. Another purpose is to establish the importance of clinician education in working with GSM clients. The final and perhaps most important purpose of this project is to provide clinicians and students with specific practical recommendations for using LGBTQ+ affirming therapy in their own clinical work across a wide array of presenting concerns and treatment settings. Ideally, readers will come away with a historical understanding of the intersection between the LGBTQ+ community and the field of mental health, an idea of what LGBTQ+ affirming therapy means and looks like, and a more specific idea of what LGBTQ+ affirming therapy looks like from a clinical practice standpoint so that they can effectively treat mental health concerns for their GSM clients.               13 II. Literature Review & Conversion Therapy Method of Conducting Literature Review  Articles were collected using the Academic Search Ultimate and PsycINFO databases via Eastern Kentucky University’s library website. The keywords that were chosen to collect articles included “LGBT,” “LGBTQ,” “Conversion Therapy,” “Ex-Gay Movement,” “Affirming Therapy,” “LGBT Affirming Therapy,” “Effects of Conversion Therapy,” “Effects of Affirming Therapy,” “intersectionality,” and “affirming therapy techniques.” Additionally, three textbooks were utilized as part of this literature review, and they are listed in the References section.  History of Conversion Therapy In order to better understand the context within which conversion therapy was born, it is important to consider the history of the LGBTQ+ movement and what most of the world’s views were on non-heterosexual individuals. Until the past few decades, it was not uncommon to hear of LGBTQ+ individuals being tortured for the purpose of experiments or simply out of spite. For example, the Nazis experimented on gay men who were held in their concentration camps during World War II (Davies & Neal, 1996). In the United States during the late 1940s through the early 1960s, a major purge of LGBTQ+ people from the State Department led to thousands of people being fired from their jobs (Blakemore, 2019). This mass exodus is now known as the Lavender Scare. Historians believe the Lavender Scare was part of a larger pushback against the quickly growing underground gay culture that began as cities grew after the end of World War II. In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450, “Security Requirements for Government Employment,” which indicated that “sexual perversion”   14 was a fair reason to terminate a person’s employment (Blakemore, 2019, para. 10). As a result of this harrowing order, several LGBTQ+ government employees died by suicide (Blakemore, 2019). It was not until 1995, when Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 12968, that the government was officially barred from discriminating against employees based on sexual identity (National Counterintelligence and Security Center, n.d.).  Although the fields of psychology and psychiatry are forward-thinking today, they were not as progressive when it came to conceptualizing LGBTQ+ individuals until the 1970s. In the United States, the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) handbook for diagnosis, the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM), being homosexual was considered a “sociopathic personality” (Forstein, 2001, p. 169) starting in 1952. This  label not only communicated that homosexuality was a disorder, but it also suggested that it was “inherently dangerous to society at large” (Forstein, 2001, p. 169). It was not until 1973 that homosexuality was removed from the second edition of the DSM (Davies & Neal, 1996). Even later, the World Health Organization’s version of the DSM, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) considered homosexuality to be a mental disorder until 1992 (Davies & Neal, 1996). In 1994, the APA conducted a study of psychiatrists across the world and found that the majority of psychiatrists in Belarus, Brazil, China, India, Poland, Romania, Spain, and Venezuela “still considered homosexuality an illness” (Forstein, 2001, p. 170).  In terms of theoretical underpinnings, psychoanalysis, behavior therapy, CBT, hypnosis, eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing, psychotropic medications, couples therapy, family therapy, group therapy, inpatient psychiatric interventions, surgical interventions, fasting, praying, exorcism, and religious counseling have all been   15 used as conversion therapy (Butler, 2010; Flentje et al., 2014; Forstein, 2001; Haldeman, 2002; Shidlo & Gonsiorek, 2017). In order to gain a sense of credibility, conversion therapy utilizes a pseudo-scientific theoretical base that is not empirically supported (Shidlo & Gonsiorek, 2017). In addition to concerns surrounding interventions utilized in conversion therapy, the most common providers of conversion therapy were clergymen and very few were psychologists, psychiatrists, or social workers (Flentje et al., 2014). Oftentimes, various interventions used in conversion therapy have names that are similar to empirically supported interventions but the interventions themselves are virtually unrelated to said interventions (Shidlo & Gonsiorek, 2017). Shidlo and Gonsiorek (2017) explain that conversion therapy is based on flawed assumptions, namely that LGBTQ+ identities are “developmental disorders caused by poor relationships with parents, defective gender identity, social rejection, trauma, and sexual abuse” (p. 294). In addition, many of the techniques used in conversion therapy are sexist and focus primarily on men (Shidlo & Gonsiorek, 2017). Rix (2013) determined that the most common reasons for individuals to seek out conversion therapy were “religious beliefs, the desire to fit in socially, the wish to please family and friends, the fear of losing family and friends, and misinformation on what it means to be gay” (p. 12). Flentje (2007) reported that the most common reasons for terminating conversion therapy treatment were “acceptance of one’s sexual orientation and the realization that the individual participant could not change their sexual orientation” (p. 62).  One common subtype of conversion therapy was called aversion therapy, which was considered a form of behavior therapy aimed at ‘curing’ homosexuality. This was done by “associating electric shocks or nausea-inducing substances with homosexual   16 stimuli” (Clarke et al., 2010, p. 12). Another behavior-based subtype was called orgasmic reconditioning, which involved “associating heterosexual stimuli with masturbation” (Clarke et al., 2010, p. 12). Perhaps most severe were the mental health professionals who turned to surgical procedures in order to convert homosexuals into heterosexuals. Specifically, these providers surgically transplanted testicular cells from heterosexual men into homosexual men, castrated gay men, removed specific sections from the brains of gay men via cerebral ablation, and performed lobotomies (Silverstein, 2003).  Effects of Conversion Therapy Presently, there is no empirical evidence that conversion therapy can ‘cure’ homosexuality (Cramer et al., 2008; Davies & Neal, 1996). However, there is evidence that leaders of conversion therapy programs have a long history of inflicting “severe psychological damage” (Davies & Neal, 1996, p. 19) on their patients. Haldeman (1991) asserted that conversion therapy is unethical because it “reinforces the social stigma associated with homosexuality” (p. 8) and it persists despite evidence that sexual identity cannot be changed. Shidlo and Schroeder (2002) conducted a large study of 202 individuals who had experienced conversion therapy in order to assess their outcomes. A sizeable majority of participants indicated that their sexual identity had not changed to heterosexual, and they often spoke of the harms they experienced at the hands of clinicians who practiced conversion therapy. Gonsiorek (2004) asserts that attempts to change one’s sexual identity lack efficacy and introduce serious ethical concerns into a clinician’s work. Shidlo and Gonsiorek (2017) stated the significance of understanding that the effects of conversion therapy often include primary (LGBTQ+ individuals) and secondary (their loved ones) victims. The National Association of Social Workers (2007)   17 asserted that conversion therapy “cannot and will not change sexual orientation” (para. 5). Additionally, Tozer and McClanahan (1999) argued against the use of conversion therapy because an LGBTQ+ identity is not a pathological condition that requires treatment.  In 2009, the APA reviewed 83 studies that utilized conversion therapy and determined that claims of efficacy and safety are unsupported by research. The APA (2009) added that there is no scientific evidence that conversion therapy increases heterosexual attraction or decreases homosexual attraction. In fact, Shidlo and Gonsiorek (2017) asserted that the constructs utilized and supported by conversion therapy are contradicted by empirical studies. Largely as a result of the APA (2009) report and other similar research studies, 20 states and the District of Columbia have banned conversion therapy as of November 2021. An additional five states have partially banned conversion therapy for minors.  Meyer (2013) interviewed a former longtime participant in conversion therapy in order to gain a deeper understanding of what actually happens in conversion therapy and what the effects are on a personal level. For simplification purposes, this former participant will be referred to as Rob. When asked about constant messages that he heard in conversion therapy, Rob replied often hearing that being gay is a choice (Meyer, 2013). He also was told that he was a “criminal,” “immoral,” and “severely mentally ill” (Meyer, 2013, p. 39) individual. He also reported that he did not experience significant guilt about his sexual identity until he began conversion therapy (Meyer, 2013). After 3 years of conversion therapy, Rob struggled with depression, feelings of worthlessness, and severe suicidality (Meyer, 2013). Whenever he experienced setbacks, the consistent   18 reply was that he could become heterosexual if he tried “really, really hard” (Meyer, 2013, p. 40). As a result, he felt like a failure when he did not see progress over many years and sessions of conversion therapy. Rob also explained that he stayed in conversion therapy for so long because he strongly believed that his therapist was the only person in the world who had the ability to save him (Meyer, 2013).  In terms of ethical issues, APA (2009) determined that conversion therapy interventions often misrepresent empirical findings about LGBTQ+ mental health. Clinicians who conduct conversion therapy tend to engage in misinformation that leads to significant and long-lasting impacts on clients’ self-image (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Haldeman, 2002; Rix, 2013; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002). Examples of this misinformation include statements that ignore the APA’s stance on LGBTQ+ individuals, statements that LGBTQ+ identities are psychological disorders, and statements that LGBTQ+ lives and relationships are chronically unhappy (Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002). Clinicians utilizing conversion therapy also fail to follow the American Psychological Association (2012)’s guidelines for psychological practice with lesbian, gay, and bisexual clients because these guidelines prohibit discrimination, misrepresentation of empirical data, and require informed consent that would include a statement on the lack of empirical support for conversion therapy. Jenkins and Johnston (2004) maintained that clinicians who practice conversion therapy breach ethical principles by promising they can change their clients’ sexual identities and by portraying all LGBTQ+ individuals as miserable and hopeless people. Beckstead and Morrow (2004) and Shidlo and Schroeder (2002) conducted studies that assessed the perceived negative impact of undergoing conversion therapy.   19 They found that participants reported a decrease in self-esteem and authenticity, an increase in internalized homophobia, an increase in negative views on LGBTQ+ individuals, and increases in depression, hopelessness, shame, anger, social withdrawal, and suicidality (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002). Participants also demonstrated increased substance use and “high-risk sexual behaviors” (APA, 2009, p. 50). Beckstead and Morrow (2004) and Shidlo and Schroeder (2002) reported that participants experienced a loss of religious identity and beliefs that they had wasted their time and resources pursuing conversion therapy. One primary finding in these studies was that participants experienced significant disruption in their relationships with others. Participants reported hostility toward their parents, anger toward their clinicians, loss of LGBTQ+ friends, struggles with emotional intimacy in romantic relationships, and feelings of shame when they engaged in same-sex sexual behaviors (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Drescher, 2006; Haldeman, 2001; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002).  In 2011, Maccio conducted a cross-sectional research study with 37 individuals who had participated in conversion therapy. There was no statistically significant difference between the sexual orientation of participants before and after conversion therapy experiences (Maccio, 2011). Any noted changes in sexual identity through conversion therapy were slight, such as identifying as bisexual at the outset of treatment and identifying as gay at the end of treatment (Maccio, 2011). Maccio (2011) also determined that participants’ sexual behaviors, sexual feelings, and sexual thoughts did not change from pre- to post-conversion therapy. In 2006, Johnston and Jenkins surveyed 14 gay men who had undergone extensive conversion therapy. Many participants shared feelings of despair, fear, and   20 loneliness when they realized they were attracted to people of their own gender identity (Johnston & Jenkins, 2006). In response to these feelings, participants prayed to be changed, repressed their feelings, and finally turned to conversion therapy whenever those attempts failed (Johnston & Jenkins, 2006). They were clearly experiencing a significant amount of conflict between acknowledging their sexual identity and realizing that their identity was not compatible with their religious affiliations (Johnson & Jenkins, 2006). Once they began conversion therapy, common messages they received were that they were “sinful, sick, and weak” (Johnston & Jenkins, 2006, p. 69) and that they were not improving due to a “lack of effort, inherent depravity, or demonic possession.” Over time, several participants recounted believing that God hated them because they were not changing despite their best efforts (Johnston & Jenkins, 2006). Rather than giving them hope for what life might look like if they embraced a sexual minority identity, their therapists “portrayed gay men and lesbians as miserable people with no hope of finding happiness” (Johnston & Jenkins, 2006, p. 71). Overall, none of the 14 participants experienced significant or long-lasting change in their sexual identity (Johnston & Jenkins, 2006).  Over the past 20 years, there are many empirical studies that have proven the negative effects of conversion therapy. These effects include feelings of depression, guilt, hopelessness, poor self-image, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide planning, self-hatred, sexual dysfunction, violence, shame, loss of familial and social support, loss of faith, intimacy avoidance, and confusion about one’s sexual identity (APA, 2009; Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Blosnich et al., 2020; Flentje, 2007; Flentje et al., 2014; Haldeman, 2001; Haldeman, 2002; Meyer, 2015; Przeworski et al., 2020; Rix, 2013;   21 Ryan et al., 2020; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002). Shidlo and Gonsiorek (2017) concluded that most of these negative effects were caused by the following four factors: being told that their sexual identity is a mental disorder, being told that they can change their sexual identity if they are motivated enough, blaming clients whenever conversion therapy fails to work, and leading clients to have feelings of contempt towards themselves and towards other LGBTQ+ individuals. Despite the numerous negative impacts that have been reported regarding conversion therapy, it is not surprising that many GSM individuals seek to change their sexual identity because of the ways that society devalues non-heterosexual individuals and continues to demonstrate institutional homophobia in many aspects of our lives (Haldeman, 1994).  Methodological Analysis of Conversion Therapy Research Studies  Shidlo and Gonsiorek (2017) noted that a significant majority of published studies on conversion therapy show a clear “abhorrence toward LGB persons, relationships, and communities” (p. 295). One example of this abhorrence is found in a study conducted by Nicolosi (1993): “Homosexual relationships are so characteristically volatile because the homosexual hates what he loves” (p. 152). Satinover (1996) went so far as to characterize the “battle over homosexuality” as the “defining moment of our society” (p. 250). Haldeman (2002) asserted that common methodological concerns of conversion therapy studies were sampling bias, heavy reliance on testimonials, and response bias. In addition to methodological flaws, many research studies that supported the use of conversion therapy focused on three questions: “Are homosexuals sick?” “How can homosexuality be diagnosed?” and “What causes homosexuality?” (Clarke et al., 2010, p. 12).    22  In 2003, Spitzer published research that he believed supported claims that homosexual individuals could become heterosexual through conversion therapy. Once this research was published, many ex-gay organizations and practitioners of conversion therapy used these results to support their views (Grace, 2008). Spitzer (2003) also argued against the harms of conversion therapy by declaring that conversion therapy was beneficial to the participants in his study. However, many psychologists found that Spitzer’s research findings were weak after conducting several methodological reviews (Grace, 2008). Several critiques of Spitzer’s research were published, including the fact that Spitzer used selection bias of a narrowly stratified population (Grace, 2008). Spitzer also exclusively relied on self-reporting to support his claims of effectiveness, which is problematic considering the pressure for participants to report that they had changed and had become more socially and religiously desirable individuals as a result of treatment (Grace, 2008). In addition, Spitzer’s study used a retrospective design that asked participants to recall events from an average of 12 years prior (Grace, 2008). Perhaps most notably, Spitzer did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, “so he cannot claim that reported changes in sexual orientation were due to prayer as suggested by some survey respondents” (Grace, 2008, p. 571). In a surprising shift, Spitzer released an apology about the flaws in his 2003 study, stating that he made “unproven claims of efficacy” (Hancock et al., 2012, p. 500) of conversion therapy and that he apologized to anyone who pursued conversion therapy as a result of his supposed proof that conversion therapy was effective.   As part of the APA’s Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation report in 2009, methodological concerns in conversion therapy research   23 studies were discussed in depth. One primary concern was that the research “does not provide a sound basis for making compelling causal claims” (APA, 2009, p. 28). More specifically, a lack of internal validity in conversion therapy studies makes it difficult to state that changes in people’s “attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are a function of the particular interventions to which they were exposed” (APA, 2009, p. 28). Next, the APA reported that high sample attrition of up to 74% significantly lowered the overall sample sizes of conversion therapy studies (APA, 2009). In recent research on conversion therapy, a high reliance on self-reporting and measures with questionable psychometric properties including validity and reliability have been noted (APA, 2009). Another important consideration when evaluating the results of research studies is if the sample is representative of the group of people you are basing your findings on. The APA (2009) found that the majority of participants in most conversion therapy studies were white males over the age of 18. In studies across the history of conversion therapy research, there is a lack of racial diversity and there are little to no studies that have been conducted on children and adolescents (APA, 2009).  Next, the APA (2009) assessed the outcomes of conversion therapy studies. They found that none of the experimental studies they analyzed had compared outcomes to a control group (APA, 2009). When short-term reductions in same-sex behaviors were reported, they were often for people who described an attraction to men and women at the outset of treatment (APA, 2009). In the only randomized control group study that was found, the intervention did not affect same-sex sexual behavior (APA, 2009). Generally, the results from research studies on conversion therapy do not suggest that conversion therapy can increase sexual behavior with the other sex (APA, 2009). It was also   24 determined that studies that claimed an increase in participants’ overall quality of life had no basis for those claims because they did not adequately track mental health outcomes after the conclusion of treatment (APA, 2009).  The Ex-Gay Movement The ex-gay movement, or peer-based conversion therapy, peaked in the 1990s. During the 1990s, Exodus International had 120 local organizations in the United States and Canada and an additional 150 in other countries (Shidlo & Gonsiorek, 2017). Davies and Neal (1996) explained that individuals within the ‘ex-gay movement’ recruit vulnerable LGBTQ+ individuals by offering to ‘cure’ their sexual identity. This is often done by targeting individuals who strongly identify with their religious identity and who want to change their sexual identity as a direct result of their religiosity. Essentially, some Christians at the individual and institutional level have a concerning history of maximizing one’s psychological distress related to their sexual identity. Once this distress is elevated, they proceed to suggest that conversion therapy is the only viable solution to this distress (Gonsiorek, 2004). “At their core, conversion therapies seek to legitimize the use of psychological techniques and behavioral science to enforce compliance with religious orthodoxy” (Gonsiorek, 2004, p. 755). Gonsiorek (2004) adds that religious beliefs strongly influence negative beliefs about one’s LGBTQ+ identity and strongly influence one’s decision to seek out conversion therapy.  Grace (2008) conducted an in-depth study on the Christian ex-gay movement, what was used to support the movement’s claims of efficacy, and the impact of this movement on ex-gay individuals and those who participated in ex-gay facilitated conversion therapy. One of the foremost ex-gay institutions was Exodus International. In   25 fact, it was the oldest and largest institution that focused on religion and homosexuality. Founded in 1976, it became infamous for inflicting pain on thousands of individuals and for promoting sexual identity change efforts that traumatized and stigmatized these individuals and their families (Alessi, 2013). Exodus International’s mission statement stated the following: “Exodus is an international Christian effort to reach homosexuals and lesbians. Exodus upholds God’s standard of righteousness and holiness, which declares that homosexuality is sin and affirms His love and redemptive power to recreate the individual” (Grace, 2008). During the 1980s, Exodus International used the AIDS epidemic to increase interest in their mission of redemption for homosexuals. They played on the gay community’s fears about contracting AIDS, dying, and going to hell in order to bring more people to their mission (Grace, 2008). Exodus International regularly took Old Testament biblical scripture out of context and manipulated it to support their programs on a nationwide scale (Grace, 2008). In the mid-1990s, Exodus International took out full-page ads in major U.S. newspapers like The Washington Post and The New York Times in order to further spread the word of their “cure” for homosexuality. At the same time, conservative politicians and religious groups conducted major media campaigns in order to limit the civil rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and to preach the message that homosexuality is a choice that can be changed (Grace, 2008).  In 2001, Ford shared his experiences as a recipient of conversion therapy and later his reactions to these experiences as he became a mental health clinician and heard many clients report similar stories. He first shares that he was eager to attempt ex-gay therapy because his religion offered love when he was feeling his most vulnerable and isolated (Ford, 2001). This type of treatment was also seen as attractive because it was a place   26 where he could “acknowledge his sexual and affectional feelings without fear of rejection” (Ford, 2001, p. 71), and his participation was viewed as an obedience to God. At first, the love he experienced in the ex-gay ministry was “liberating” (Ford, 2001, p. 71), though he soon realized that love was purely conditional. A constant message he received was that accepting himself as a homosexual would keep him from heaven, which was a significant fear due to his religious beliefs and the importance he placed on them (Ford, 2001). As the honeymoon phase ends, failures are not tolerated and reporting of such failures often leads to severe chastisement (Ford, 2001). The treatment is never seen as the failure during these experiences. Rather, the person’s “relationship with God” (Ford, 2001, p. 73) is seen as the reason why their sexual identity is not changing. Ford (2001) reported a fear of abandonment so severe that he did not feel safe telling his therapist the truth and consistently viewed suicide as a “viable option” (p. 74). He added that “the thought of living my life as a gay man and going to hell seemed much worse than taking my own life while I was still in grace” (Ford, 2001, p. 79). Another trend was that many ex-gay therapists were known to have sexual relations with program participants and were often removed from their posts as a result (Ford, 2001). After several years of therapy with gay affirming therapy, Ford (2001) was able to experience happiness and security in his identity as a gay man.  When looking at the programs that made up Exodus International, it is clear that they focused on the rejection and sadness that gay men struggled with and provided them with an apparent solution (Grace, 2008). Once they entered the program, participants were subject to a deleterious process of blaming themselves and others for their sexual identities. Participants were told that they could not be fulfilled, were sinners who were   27 “sexually broken”, weak, and confused individuals who became gay because they had “absentee, uncaring, or otherwise abusive parents” (Grace, 2008, p. 551). They were also told that people choose homosexuality after experiences with incest and/or molestation (Grace, 2008). If it seems surprising that so many people turned to Exodus International given this information, consider that it often seemed like the only possible solution for LGBTQ+ people who struggled with familial rejection and religious condemnation (Haldeman, 2001). When the organization closed their doors in 2012, the president of Exodus International apologized for the damage that was done to the many LGB individuals who sought out their services.  Institutionalized & Internalized Homophobia Institutionalized Homophobia Institutionalized homophobia essentially translates to institutions and systems assuming that everyone is heterosexual and cisgender (Davies & Neal, 1996). Consider times in your own life when you may have noticed that people assumed that you have an opposite sex partner rather than asking before the fact. Generally, society does not consider the fact that there are many LGBTQ+ people in the world and that this ignorance adds to feelings of exclusion by anyone who is not heterosexual and cisgender.  One classic example of institutionalized homophobia being mentioned in academic literature is Tinney’s (1983) discussion of several different ways that society oppresses LGB people (transgender individuals are not mentioned in this article, unfortunately). One example mentioned is society’s attempt to keep large numbers of LGBTQ+ people from interacting with each other outside of LGBTQ+ bars and clubs. In many areas, there are zero LGBTQ+ community centers and zero places for LGBTQ+   28 minors to meet with each other, especially outside of major cities. Boswell (1980) cited numerous examples of history being revised to ignore positive mentions of LGBTQ+ culture and contributions made by LGBTQ+ people. This was done by simple deletion, censorship, and even changing of gender identities (Boswell, 1980). Another example is that the general population tends to minimize the existence and strength of LGBTQ+ people across the world. Additionally, there is often a “fear of over-visibility” (Tinney, 1983, p. 45) where people feel uncomfortable discussing non-heterosexual relationships and often complain if LGBTQ+ individuals share about their experiences in public. Finally, Tinney (1983) asserts that society assigns negative symbolism to people who deviate from the societal norm of identifying as heterosexual and cisgender. LGBTQ+ people are stereotyped as being shallow, promiscuous, drug-loving, and eager to “recruit” unsuspecting children and adolescents to join them.  Even today, schools often refuse to teach students about LGBTQ+ identities for fear of retribution by parents, government agencies, and educational institutions. When positive examples of LGBTQ+ identities are left out of schools, young people are being indirectly taught that identifying as such is unnatural, unhealthy, and uncommon (Davies & Neal, 1996). This lack of education also serves to further support the homophobia that still pervades a significant sector of society.  Whenever LGBTQ+ characters are introduced in films, television shows, and miniseries, they are still often depicted as stereotypical people who are loud, dramatic, simple-minded, and oversexualized. LGBTQ+ media representation is crucial to communicating the fact that being LGBTQ+ is normal, healthy, and relatively common to a large audience. Even “classic” LGB television shows such as Will & Grace (Mutchnick   29 et al., 1998-2006), Queer as Folk (Jonas et al., 2000-2005), and The L Word (Chaiken et al., 2004-2009) tended to depict mainly white, cisgender characters.  Institutionalized homophobia even permeates the world of mental health. For example, there is still a tendency for clinicians to assume that LGBTQ+ clients are in therapy for issues related to their sexual and/or gender identities. While this may certainly be the case, it is not true 100% of the time.  Internalized Homophobia While institutionalized homophobia exists at the institutional and societal level, internalized homophobia primarily exists at the individual level. As a result, experiences with internalized homophobia/biphobia/transphobia vary widely across clients. Internalized homophobia indicates the experience that LGBTQ+ individuals have when they take the hate and prejudice they experience and observe and turn it inwardly on their own sexual and gender identities. Internalized homophobia can lead to a dissatisfaction in one’s sexual and/or gender identity, hatred of oneself in general, and even self-destructive behaviors. In addition, internalized homophobia is associated with depression, anxiety, romantic relationship issues, social isolation, and even suicide (Alderson, 2013; Hill, 2009). Similarly, Love et al. (2014) found that internalized homophobia was related to issues with self-esteem, social support, intimacy, and overall emotional distress. These experiences often evolve into LGBTQ+ people feeling unhappy with their identity and wishing they were heterosexual and cisgender instead. Hansbury and Bennett (2014) asserted that all gay, bisexual, and transgender people “have internalized homo/bi/transphobia” as a result of growing up in a “homophobic society that either   30 tends to promote prejudicial myths about gay, bisexual, and transgender people or negates their existence in general” (p. 204).   LGBTQ+ Emotional & Psychological Health One critical consideration in conceptualizing LGBTQ+ clients is that of their emotional and psychological health compared to heterosexual clients.  Emotional Health Although research shows that LGBTQ+ individuals report significantly higher levels of psychological distress compared with heterosexual and cisgender individuals, Rieger et al. (2008) found that LGBTQ+ people had greater empathy, more sense of community, more connection to one’s true self, and were more likely to be involved in social justice causes. When looking at a three-year follow-up study of same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples, Balsam et al. (2008) found that same-sex couples “reported higher relationship quality, compatibility, and intimacy, and less conflicts” (p. 113). Resiliency and greater life satisfaction have also been determined as strengths within LGBT individuals (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017).  Psychological Health  When looking at specific types of psychological health indicators, Cochran (2001) and Hinrichs and Donaldson (2017) determined that gay men are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and substance use concerns than straight men. Similarly, Lombardi and van Servellen (2000) found that transgender individuals are at a higher risk for substance use and self-concept problems than cisgender individuals. Hinrichs and Donaldson (2017) and Lindstrom et al. (2020) determined that LGBT adults have disproportionately high rates of substance abuse, depression, and HIV risk. Muraco   31 (2014) and Woodford et al. (2018) demonstrated that LGBTQ+ individuals had a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, poor self-esteem, and suicidality compared with heterosexual and cisgender individuals. Specifically, 10% of trans and 5% of cisgender LGBQ students surveyed had attempted suicide in the past year (Woodford et al., 2018). By comparison, the American College Health Association (2014) reported that nationwide surveys of college students revealed a 12-month prevalence between 0.6% and 1.3%. In terms of lifetime prevalence, 41% of GSM individuals have had at least one suicide attempt compared to 1.6% of the general population (Smalley et al., 2018). Individuals who identify as gay or bisexual males are three times more likely to meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder than heterosexual males (Smalley et al., 2018). Lesbians were found to be significantly more likely to meet criteria for the disorder than heterosexual females (Smalley et al., 2018). When looking at rates of anxiety disorders, GSM individuals are 1.5 times more likely to meet criteria compared to heterosexual and cisgender individuals (Smalley et al., 2018). In addition to LGBTQ+ adults, Austin and Craig (2015) reported that GSM youth have an increased risk of experiencing depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance use than heterosexual and cisgender youth.   Traumatic experiences are also a pressing concern for the LGBTQ+ community. For example, individuals with a minority sexual identity were significantly more likely to experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than were individuals who identified as heterosexual (Smalley et al., 2018). GSM individuals were also almost twice as likely to meet criteria for PTSD compared to people who identified as heterosexual and cisgender (Smalley et al., 2018). When considering bias-related victimization, 60-  32 70% of GSM individuals reported at least one experience in their lifetimes (Smalley et al., 2018).   Woodford et al. (2018) surveyed 776 LGBTQ+ American college students in order to determine mental health concerns and potential causes for those concerns. They found that experiences with heterosexism, both subtle and overt, were associated with increased risk for experiencing depression and suicide attempts (Woodford et al., 2018). Stress researchers suggested that LGBTQ+ individuals experience heightened psychological distress because of a “mismatch between the person and their social environment” (Woodford et al., 2018, p. 434). Conceptualizing experiences of LGBTQ+ victimization can “help to explain why victimization is a risk factor for depression and attempted suicide” (Woodford et al., 2018, p. 434) in LGBTQ+ college students.  Anzani et al. (2019) established that transgender individuals are at a higher risk of struggling with depression, anxiety, substance use, and self-injurious behaviors than their cisgender counterparts. Making matters worse, they determined that 18% of transgender individuals had experienced one or more mental health providers trying to keep them from accessing gender affirming surgery (Anzani et al., 2019). Overall, 33% of transgender people surveyed reported that they had at least one negative experience with a healthcare provider in the past year alone (Anzani et al., 2019). Numerous reports agreed that when trans patients were open about their gender identities in healthcare settings, they were at an increased risk of discrimination (Anzani et al., 2019). As a result of these experiences, 23% of trans people avoid seeking mental or medical health services even though many are required to seek therapy if they want to receive gender-affirming treatment (Anzani et al., 2019).    33 III. LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy Introduction to LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy Unlike other types of psychotherapy, LGBTQ+ affirmative therapy is not its own separate system of therapy (Johnson, 2012). Instead, it involves a specialized knowledge that uses “traditional psychotherapeutic methods but proceeds from a non-traditional perspective” (Maylon, 1982, p. 69). As a result, affirming therapy can be used in conjunction with a traditional system, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). LGBTQ+ affirming therapy considers homophobia, rather than homosexuality, as a significant concern to address in therapy (Benson, 2013; Maylon, 1982). Additionally, it is important that LGBTQ+ affirming clinicians see an LGBTQ+ identity as equal to a heterosexual and cisgender identity (Alderson, 2013; Corturillo et al., 2016). Crisp and McCave (2007) summarized the goals of an LGBTQ+ affirming clinician as someone who “celebrates, advocates, and validates the identities” (p. 405) of LGBTQ+ clients.   History Historically, one of the first affirmative views of homosexuality came from the publication of Sexual Behavior in the Human Male by Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin in 1948 and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female by Kinsey, Pomeroy, Martin, and Gebhard in 1953. These studies demonstrated that having a minority sexual identity was more common than was previously believed and suggested that such identities were normal identities (APA, 2009). In 1957, Hooker reported that homosexual men were just as well-adjusted to everyday life as heterosexual men. Three years later in 1960, Armon replicated these results with lesbian women. In the 1970s, several research studies compared the personality of homosexual and heterosexual individuals using personality   34 measures like Cattell’s Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (APA, 2009). These researchers found that gay men and lesbian women were similar to heterosexual men and women in overall functioning and adjustment (APA, 2009). Just as important, research studies done from the 1960s-1990s consistently demonstrated that family dynamics and traumatic experiences did not impact the development of one’s sexual identity, which challenged the psychopathological view of homosexuality (APA, 2009).  Core Concepts of LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy Moradi and Budge (2018) view LGBTQ+ affirming therapy as encompassing four overarching points of emphasis (with examples in parentheses): working against anti-LGBTQ+ therapist beliefs by emphasizing LGBTQ+ affirmative beliefs (communicating clinician beliefs that LGBTQ+ individuals are equal to cisgender and heterosexual individuals), gathering information regarding the experiences and diversity of LGBTQ+ individuals (engaging in meaningful discussion about diversity within LGBTQ+ communities), integrating said information into therapeutic conceptualization and interventions (intentionally including how cultural context impacts LGBTQ+ clients and their presenting concerns), and “engaging in and affirming challenges to power inequities” (p. 2030) (discussing said inequities with clients and communicating understanding of this reality with clients).  Davies and Neal (1996) contend that respect is a “core condition” (p. 26) of affirming therapy, and that there are four specific types of respect within that condition: respect for the client’s sexual identity, respect for personal integrity, respect for lifestyle and culture, and respectful attitudes and beliefs. Respect for the client’s sexual identity   35 means that the clinician accepts that a non-heterosexual identity is just as healthy and is equal to a heterosexual identity (Davies & Neal, 1996). Respect for personal integrity means that the therapeutic relationship is collaborative in nature and that the clinician acts as a “companion in the client’s journey, rather than the tour guide” (p. 26). In terms of respect for lifestyle and culture, clinicians are tasked with learning about the diversity of cultural identities that exist within the LGBTQ+ community. It is essential to keep in mind that it is not the client’s job to teach a clinician about the LGBTQ+ community in general terms (Davies & Neal, 1996). Finally, respectful attitudes and beliefs translates to a crucial duty of clinicians to fully understand their own values and attitudes regarding sexual and gender identity prior to working with LGBTQ+ clients (Davies & Neal, 1996). In terms of beliefs, there are several that would make it impossible for a clinician to apply LGBTQ+ affirming therapy to their clients, including beliefs that a non-heterosexual identity is sinful, unnatural, a perversion, inferior to a heterosexual identity, that relationships can only be sexual, that LGBTQ+ parents are not equal to heterosexual parents, and that bisexual individuals can decide to be either heterosexual or homosexual (Davies & Neal, 1996). Hinrichs and Donaldson (2017) assert that a critical condition of affirming therapy is the development of a trusting therapeutic relationship that features active listening, validation, and an openness to explore all issues related to sexual and gender identities. At times, affirmative therapy can be utilized in order to address a client’s insecurities and self-criticism that have been exacerbated by society’s views on LGBTQ+ individuals (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). Hinrichs and Donaldson (2017) added that clients often do most of the therapeutic work themselves once an affirmative and   36 nonjudgmental environment has been established within the context of therapy. Appleby and Anastas (1998) suggest that there are six core principles of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy: Not assuming that clients are heterosexual; believing that homophobia and not an LGBTQ+ identity is the problem; believing that having an LGBTQ+ identity is a positive outcome of therapy; assisting clients in reducing experiences of internalized homophobia; being educated about the coming out process; and addressing one’s own biases related to homophobia and heterosexism. In 2009, the American Psychological Association’s Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation released a 140-page report detailing LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, evidence-based practice when working with GSM clients, a history of conversion therapy, and a review of conversion therapy effects. At the heart of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy are the beliefs that LGBTQ+ identities are stigmatized and can have many negative effects across the life span; LGBTQ+ sexual and gender identities are normal variants of human sexuality; and LGBTQ+ individuals can enjoy “satisfying lives and form stable, committed relationships and families that are equivalent to heterosexuals’ relationships and families in essential respects” (APA, 2009, p. 14). The American Psychological Association (2009) advocated the use of a person-centered approach that emphasizes unconditional positive regard, empathy, openness to client perspectives, and “encouragement of the client’s positive self-concept” (p. 55). Affirmative approaches view one’s sexual and gender identities as being a significant aspect of one’s personality and sense of self (APA, 2009).     37 Common Topics When Working with LGBTQ+ Clients Long (1996) interviewed LGBTQ+ clients and asked them what they would like their prospective therapist to know. Their responses centered around four major themes: “awareness of invisibility in society; coming out as a continual process; social and political LGBT history; and awareness of the effects of homo/transphobia, including the impact of violence” (p. 382). In addition, common topics that arise when working with GSM clients include discrimination, prejudice, rejection, relationship adjustments with friends and family, and difficulty working in inclusive environments (Butler, 2010).  Another common concern that often arises when working with LGBTQ+ individuals is a lengthy history of experiencing rejection. This rejection may come from the world at large, friends, family, and other loved ones as a result of them identifying as non-heterosexual and/or non-cisgender (Nel et al., 2007). Perhaps even more damaging is the fact that this rejection often extends to one’s self-rejection as a result of these experiences (Nel et al., 2007). This self-rejection is not unlike the concerns regarding internalized homophobia that are discussed in prior sections of the current project. Interventions In terms of techniques, Benson (2013) found that simply adopting and communicating an affirmative stance towards a client’s various identities was powerful for a significant number of transgender clients. Regarding LGBTQ+ affirming interventions, the most effective ones focus on “helping the individual develop self-love and a respect for others who” (Alderson, 2013, p. 54) identify as LGBTQ+. If you prefer to use a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approach, you may ask your clients, “What proof do you have that you are less than heterosexual people because you define as gay?”   38 (Alderson, 2013, p. 54). Participants in a qualitative study done by Rostosky et al. (2008) shared that they coped with their sexual identity and racial identity stressors by “seeking support, meaning making, using humor, using active problem solving, and avoidant behaviors” (p.71). McKinney et al. (2020) recommend the following interventions: acceptance practices to validate clients within invalidating environments, challenging heteronormative societal messages through advocacy, utilizing thought logs for analyzing and modifying negative self-talk, and “interpersonal training to build positive supports and mitigate negative social forces” (p. 184). Furthermore, Love et al. (2014) determined that the use of empathy significantly predicted the overall use of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy.  Crisp and McCave (2007) and Hill (2009) recommend a strengths-based approach when utilizing LGBTQ+ affirming therapy that emphasizes psychological health rather than pathology, addresses clients’ skills in self-determination, and builds on their existing strengths. In addition, Hill (2009) identified the goal of affirming therapy as assisting clients in “developing enough resistance to internalized oppression, enough clarity about sexual orientation and identity, and enough skill at making decisions about disclosure so that energy is freed for other life goals” (p. 354). Love et al. (2014) asserts that affirming therapy involves “celebrating and advocating the validity of” (p. 86) LGBTQ+ individuals and working against the messages they have received across their lives that promote homophobia, heterosexism, and internalized homophobia.  Zapor and Stuart (2016) recommend utilizing an affirmative CBT approach, especially when depression is a primary presenting concern because it “closely examines the environmental and social context of the client’s life, which may be colored by   39 heterosexism and discrimination” (p. 146). Additionally, affirmative CBT encourages clients to practice active problem solving while keeping in mind that one’s sexual identity and/or gender identity may have a major or minor impact on their presenting concerns (Zapor & Stuart, 2016). Pachankis (2009) promoted using affirmative CBT to promote authenticity through assertiveness training. Specifically, assertiveness training “encourages individuals to identify their individual rights…in any given situation and to act in accordance with those rights in a way that promotes self-respect” (Pachankis, 2009, p. 33). Job and Williams (2020) provided research data that supports the use of Positive Psychology when working with GSM clients. Interventions with the highest effect sizes included emphasis on love, humor, spirituality, self-compassion, gratitude, and optimism (Job & Williams, 2020). When outcomes were assessed, building self-compassion in clients was found to reduce psychological distress and increase resiliency in the face of minority stress (Job & Williams, 2020). Optimism was also found to be a key ingredient in successful Positive Psychology interventions with GSM clients, especially in reducing distress related to anticipated stigma (Job & Williams, 2020). In addition, establishment and/or maintenance of social support was found to improve health outcomes and mitigate the negative effects of minority stress (Job & Williams, 2020). A unique intervention that was supported by research is the use of humor interventions in order to reduce depression, increase happiness, and introduce a new positive coping skill (Job & Williams, 2020). In fact, 70% of participants indicated that humor interventions were helpful in dealing with homophobia and heterosexism (Job & Williams, 2020).    40 Strengths-based interventions are a crucial evidence-based practice that have proven to be effective at improving client wellness and reducing psychological symptoms (Smalley et al., 2018). Westcott (2020) posited that LGBTQ+ individuals have unique strengths that “promote psychological well-being in the LGBT community” (p. 8), such as: resilience, creativity, bravery, authenticity, love, and stress-related growth. When considering character strengths, integrity, love, gratitude, creativity, and fairness have been associated with LGBTQ+ clients (Westcott, 2020). Westcott (2020) recommended interventions that focus on helping LGBTQ+ clients develop positive identities, resources, and strengths in order to improve psychological functioning, reduce the impact of minority stress, and increase LGBTQ+ community connectedness. When conducting strengths-based work, it is important to begin with client-identified strengths and then assess for further strengths if necessary.  Smalley et al. (2018) researched evidence-based interventions for GSM individuals at the individual and interpersonal levels. In terms of individual-level interventions, they reported that an expressive writing intervention involving a 20-minute writing exercise three times per week for two weeks was found to reduce perceived stress (Smalley et al., 2018). Another expressive writing intervention resulted in increased openness about sexual identity, decreased mental health symptomatology, and decreased internalized heterosexism three months after the intervention concluded (Smalley et al., 2018). At the interpersonal level, a family therapy focused on attachment for suicidal GSM adolescents was found to reduce depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and avoidance (Smalley et al., 2018).     41 LGBTQ+ Affirming Group Therapy Nel et al. (2007) discussed at length his experiences with facilitating an LGBTQ+ affirming therapy group. The group was created in order to address issues and concerns that arise from identifying as LGBTQ+. At the outset, Nel et al. (2007) stress the importance of fostering trust and encouraging disclosure amongst group members. Overall, Nel et al. (2007) observed that the group they created led to feelings of safety and security, normalization, self-affirmation, belonging, honesty, self-acceptance, and personal change. When looking at aspects of the group that promoted change, Nel et al. (2007) posited that the group’s process and content combined to create significant personal growth within the group participants. Ross et al. (2007) utilized a group version of affirmative CBT in order to decrease symptoms of depression and increase self-esteem. After 14 weeks, results indicated that affirmative CBT significantly decreased depression and increased self-esteem in a group format (Ross et al., 2007). Lloyd et al. (2021) conducted LGBTQ+ group therapy with CBT underpinnings and found that all participants voiced support for the group’s ability to provide a safe, affirming, and validating place. In terms of symptom presentation, participants were found to experience a decrease in their symptoms of anxiety and depression and an increase in their self-esteem (Lloyd et al., 2021). Overall, these results support the use of affirmative CBT when working with LGBTQ+ clients in group therapy. LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy for Children & Adolescents Austin and Craig (2015) asserted that LGBTQ+ affirming therapy for children and adolescents should focus on empowerment rather than pathologization, “supporting   42 self-determination; considering presenting problems within a context of homophobia, transphobia, and discrimination” (p. 569), and encourage clients to challenge the heteronormativity, homophobia, and transphobia that they encounter. In addition, they emphasized identifying and establishing affirmative support systems (Austin & Craig, 2015). Overall, they saw the goal of affirming therapy as helping youth to “develop positive sexual and gender identities in large part by empowering them to cope effectively with identity based stigma and discrimination” (p. 569). Austin and Craig (2015) went on to develop a manual for utilizing group-based CBT with GSM youth. They identified the following factors as core elements for the manual: psychoeducation, inclusion of sexual and gender identity concerns, developmental concerns that impact coming out during adolescence, validation of a wide array of identities, and a discussion on the difference between internal and external stressors (Austin & Craig, 2015). When analyzing feedback, they found that the participants perceived the intervention as “affirming, a good fit, helpful, and consistent with CBT” (Austin & Craig, 2015, p. 575). Fluidity in Sexual and Gender Identity If one is considering the use of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, it is important to keep in mind that binary models of sexual identity severely limit our awareness of the experiences of people who identify as bisexual, pansexual, asexual, fluid, polysexual, queer, and many more (Clarke et al., 2010). When working with clients who identify as queer, it is important to know that they may be opposed to aligning themselves with a definitive sexual and/or gender identity (Clarke et al., 2010). This consideration can provide a crucial opportunity for clinicians to discuss how society and culture impact   43 how LGBTQ+ clients see themselves as individuals and as people who are part of the larger society (Clarke et al., 2010).  Discussing Conversion Therapy in the Context of LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy Given the fact that thousands of individuals have experiences with conversion therapy, it is likely that clinicians would work with LGBTQ+ clients who have experienced conversion therapy. In these instances, Shidlo and Gonsiorek (2017) recommend educating clients on the following: identifying as LGBTQ+ is healthy and normal, there is no basis for claims that LGBTQ+ couples are psychologically dysfunctional, LGBTQ+ couples’ parenting abilities are the same as heterosexual individuals, and the “effectiveness of (conversion therapy) is unsubstantiated and their theories are erroneous” (p. 303). Clinicians should also be aware of the potential for such clients to struggle with tension between their sexual identity, religious identity, and other identities that are preventing LGBTQ+ clients from experiencing an integrated and cohesive identity (Shidlo & Gonsiorek, 2017).  Working with Internalized Homophobia As a clinician, it is important to bring internalized homophobia to the awareness of your LGBTQ+ clients (if indicated) and to discuss the messages that society gives us all about sexual and gender identities. Ideally, this can lead to conversations about the impact of those messages on your client’s feelings about themselves and about other people who share similar identities. It is not uncommon for issues of internalized homophobia to be part of an LGBTQ+ client’s presenting concerns and reasons for seeking therapy, but clinicians must be careful not to assume that this is always the case.    44  When working with internalized homophobia in therapy, clinicians may want to engage in cognitive restructuring in order to create a positive view of one’s sexual and/or gender identity. When discussing stereotypes of the LGBTQ+ community, it is important to include discussion about diversity and intersectionality within the community (Davies & Neal, 1996). Another solution could be to discuss the possibility of self-disclosure or ‘coming out’, but only when it is safe, and the client feels comfortable doing so. At times, establishing or maintaining an LGBTQ+ support system can also serve to reduce one’s feelings of internalized homophobia (Davies & Neal, 1996). Davies and Neal (1996) recommend working on internalized homophobia and more adaptive coping strategies when dealing with societal homophobia rather than helping clients find a ‘cure’ for their LGBTQ+ identity.  Clinician Self-Disclosure If an LGBTQ+ clinician is working with LGBTQ+ clients, an inner conflict may arise over whether or not they should disclose their own sexual or gender identity to their clients. When considering this, it is important to understand the purpose of such self-disclosure. Hanbury and Bennett (2014) advocate for therapist self-disclosure if the purpose is to “provide a model and to detoxify the client’s shame” (p. 209). Self-disclosure could also be appropriate if the clinician intends to communicate a deeper level of empathy that non-LGBTQ+ clinicians cannot. Others see such self-disclosure not as a possibility but as an inevitability (Cole & Drescher, 2006). Clinician self-disclosure can also serve to “make therapy a more readily viable choice for those who have felt shunned and pathologized by those who purported to offer them help” (Cole & Drescher,   45 2006, p. 3). Harrison (2000) also expressed support for clinician self-disclosure, especially as a way to provide a “positive role model” (p. 39).  Therapeutic Alliance Bettergarcia and Israel (2018) affirmed that the therapeutic relationship is of critical concern when working with transgender clients. Their research results indicated that the therapeutic relationship can be strengthened when an affirming approach is utilized (Bettergarcia & Israel, 2018). Furthermore, seeing a clinician as affirming made trans clients more likely to view their clinicians as trustworthy, an expert in their field, and likeable (Bettergarcia & Israel, 2018). Bettergarcia and Israel (2018) demonstrated that the strongest predictor of overall psychological adjustment, positive affect, self-esteem, and optimism was the therapeutic relationship. Burckell and Goldfried (2006) also communicated support for the importance of “establishing and maintaining a strong therapeutic alliance” (p. 45). Impact of Using LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy Use of affirming therapy has been found to have a substantial impact on the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals. Smalley et al. (2018) found that 80% of individuals who received affirming care reported improvement in gender dysphoria, 78% improved in psychological symptom presentation, and 80% improved in overall well-being. Affirmative therapy was found to increase active coping skills during times of increased distress and the use of cognitive strategies were found to reduce self-stigma and reduce negative self-beliefs (APA, 2009). Research has indicated that affirmative CBT can result in significantly decreased depression, anxiety, and overall psychological distress compared to baseline functioning (Zapor & Stuart, 2016).   46 Importance of Clinician Training in LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy Davies and Neal (1996) suggest that clinician trainers educate students about LGBTQ+ issues in order to minimize any pressure on clients who may feel compelled to educate clinicians within the therapeutic context. Trainers are also encouraged to teach students about the development of sexual and gender identity, the coming out process, and LGBTQ+ issues across the lifespan. Additionally, it is important to avoid homophobia within the areas of supervision and consultation. In these instances, it is critical for supervisors, supervisees, and consultants to remain vigilant for signs of homophobia and to address them as they arise in an appropriate but open manner (Davies & Neal, 1996).  McGeorge et al. (2018) highlighted the importance of training in working with LGBTQ+ clients because LGBTQ+ individuals seek therapy services at higher rates than people who identify as heterosexual. If LGBTQ+ clients do not feel their clinicians are not educated in the nuances of working with this population, rapport may be difficult to establish and progress may be hindered (McGeorge et al., 2018). Additionally, the mental health concerns that LGBTQ+ people experience as a result of living in a heterosexist society make clinician training essential in order to provide the support they deserve (McGeorge et al., 2018).  Despite the importance of LGBTQ+-focused clinical training, Chazin and Klugman (2014) reported that a significant number of clinicians feel they have limited knowledge in working with LGBTQ+ clients. Bettergarcia and Israel (2018) affirmed that educating clinicians about supportive and affirmative therapy is “key to increasing positive experiences, decreasing negative experiences, and building trust with   47 transgender communities” (p. 429). Corturillo et al. (2016) stressed the importance of faculty members attaining knowledge about the negative impact that living in a heterosexist world has on the experiences of LGBTQ+ clients. In their quest to assess the education of faculty members regarding working with LGBTQ+ clients, Corturillo et al. (2016) found that many faculty members reported receiving very little LGBTQ+ affirmative training. Specifically, 44.6% of respondents reported that they had received this type of training during their graduate training. Even when faculty members had received such training, they reported that most of such courses were “non-clinical courses, such as human development, family science, and human sexuality” (Corturillo et al., 2016, p. 68). As a result, it is crucial that faculty members receive clinically based training that specifically focuses on clinical experiences with LGBTQ+ clients. Furthermore, Corturillo et al. (2016) recommend an approach to training that includes LGBTQ+ considerations in each aspect of one’s educational experience, particularly in graduate school training.  Further stating the importance of faculty member training, McGeorge et al. (2018) found that faculty members’ level of LGBTQ+ clinical training predicted the degree to which they incorporated LGBTQ+-focused training in their own courses. When considering course content, McGeorge et al. (2018) recommend teaching students about “the sociopolitical constructs that negatively influence the lives of LGB individuals and relationships, such as sexual minority prejudice, gay-related stress, internalized homophobia, heterosexism, heterosexual privilege, and heteronormativity” (p. 4). Constantine (2001) determined that multicultural training and the presence of empathy significantly predicted a clinician’s ability to successfully implement LGBTQ+ affirming   48 therapy. Alessi et al. (2016) found that more LGBTQ+ competency training hours were associated with “more affirmative attitudes, higher levels of affirmative counseling self-efficacy, and more positive beliefs” (p. 453).  Carlson et al. (2013) created the Affirmative Training Inventory (ATI) in order to determine how much training student clinicians receive in working with LGBTQ+ clients. They decided to assess the validity and factorial structure of the ATI in order to determine how well the ATI measures LGBTQ+ training (Carlson et al., 2013). Carlson et al. (2013) determined that the ATI is a valid measure of LGBTQ+ affirmative training. This outcome suggests that preparing students to work with LGBTQ+ clients includes course-based training, supervision, and an “overall LGBTQ+ affirmative environment in the training program” (Carlson et al., 2013, p. 218). As a result, the emphasis should be on how all faculty members view working with LGBTQ+ clients because of the impact that this can have on a program’s overall environment. Carlson et al. (2013) also determined that the more students learn about LGBTQ+ affirming therapy and the more opportunities they have to work with LGBTQ+ clients, the more competent they felt when working with LGBTQ+ clients.  Godfrey et al. (2006) sought out to determine which aspects of curricula are essential for working effectively with LGBTQ+ clients. They advocate for students to learn about unique strengths and challenges of LGBTQ+ individuals, in addition to ways that LGBTQ+ culture compares to and contrasts with the dominant culture (Godfrey et al., 2006). According to LGBTQ+ clients, the most effective clinicians are those that understand societal prejudice, internalized homophobia, relationship concerns, and community supports as they relate to LGBTQ+ people (Godfrey et al., 2006). Godfrey et   49 al. (2006) recommend that clinicians educate themselves about heterocentrism, heterosexism, negative effects of conversion therapy, and the privileged status that comes with identifying as both heterosexual and cisgender.  In 2013, Bidell used the Sexual Orientation Counselor Competency Scale (SOCCS) self-report tool to determine the impact of an LGBT-affirming counseling course on clinician competency. At the end of the full semester course, Bidell (2013) found that an “LGBT graduate course can significantly improve counseling students’ sexual orientation counselor competency and self-efficacy” (p. 303). Not only did the students significantly improve their competency and self-efficacy, they also scored significantly higher in both areas compared to the control group (Bidell, 2013).  Affirming Therapy in the Coming Out Process The process of coming out is a central theme for many (not all) LGBTQ+ people (APA, 2009; Davies & Neal, 1996). It signifies an individual accepting themselves and feeling comfortable and safe with sharing their sexual and/or gender identity with loved ones (Davies & Neal, 1996). Coming out is critical because it tends to be a culmination of a person’s sexual and/or gender identity exploration process (Alderson, 2013). LGBTQ+ people who are out are more likely to be psychologically healthy compared to those who are not (Alderson, 2013). A major contribution to this difference is likely related to the impact of integrating their LGBTQ+ identity and overcoming internalized homophobia (Van Zyl et al., 2017). LGBTQ+ youth who had come out were found to experience improved overall well-being compared to closeted youth (Kosciw et al., 2015). This improved well-being was also found to last throughout young adulthood (Kosciw et al., 2015). While coming out is a common occurrence, it is a largely individual process that   50 varies widely. Coming out is influenced by many variables, including gender identity, racial identity, ethnic identity, regional identity, physical ability, socioeconomic status, and religious identity. It is also worth noting that coming out as having a non-heterosexual identity can look vastly different from coming out as having a non-cisgender identity. When considering the impact of race and/or ethnicity on the coming out process, one important consideration is that although a member of a minority racial and/or ethnic identity has likely experienced racial prejudice, they are often supported in these experiences by their loved ones. When coming to terms with LGBTQ+ prejudice, that familial and peer support may not be guaranteed (Davies & Neal, 1996). As will be discussed in the section on the role of intersectionality, LGBTQ+ people of color often experience more discrimination than do white LGBTQ+ individuals. So, it is reasonable to consider that LGBTQ+ people of color may rely on support from loved ones even more heavily than do white LGBTQ+ individuals. Another crucial consideration of LGBTQ+ people of color is that for as rare as it is to see LGBTQ+ media representation, it is far rarer to see LGBTQ+ people of color represented in the media. Media representation can also serve to “challenge negative stereotypes” regarding any minority identities (Butler, 2010, p. 88). Youth having these role models and examples of people like them can be a crucial part of acceptance that they are not alone in their identities.  An additional consideration in variations of the coming out process is where the individual is from and/or where they live geographically. As mentioned earlier, LGBTQ+ community centers and events are often exclusive to larger cities and metropolitan areas, though that is slowly changing. In more heavily populated areas, you are more likely to   51 have visible representation of LGBTQ+ people than you are in more rural areas. Much like in media representation, having representation in one’s everyday life can also have a sizeable impact on one’s own sexual and/or gender identity exploration and acceptance. When living in smaller towns, LGBTQ+ people may rarely encounter other LGBTQ+ people unless they visit more metropolitan areas. This is a significant consideration when looking at the feasibility of your client maintaining, expanding, or creating an LGBTQ+ support network. When LGBTQ+ people grow up in less populated areas, they often come out at older ages, if at all (Davies & Neal, 1996).  When considering working with clients in their coming out process, another major factor is how clients perceive and experience their clinicians (Davies & Neal, 1996). The more affirming the clinician, the more likely clients will feel comfortable in discussing and pursuing the coming out process. There are of course many other considerations when working with the coming out process.  One of those considerations is the impact that denial can have on a client coming out. A client may be having gay sexual experiences but may not identify as gay/bisexual/pansexual. If denial is at play, then it is likely that even mentioning coming out would seriously damage rapport. Another concern that presents itself in therapy is that of identity confusion, which is when clients think that they may be LGBTQ+ but they are not satisfied with that prospect (Davies & Neal, 1996). In these situations, the way a clinician responds is critical to the success of providing affirming therapy. This situation presents an opportunity to discuss LGBTQ+ agencies, centers, and events in the area as a way of further introducing a client to what may be some of their first experiences with LGBTQ+ people.    52 While coming out to friends and family can be a relieving and joyous experience, there is a significant possibility that it may produce significant feelings of depression, anxiety, and isolation (Ali & Lambie, 2019). This depression can occur after coming out or in anticipation of how loved ones may react to the news. Oftentimes clients fear that they will lose family support and that their coming out may damage their family relationships for a long period of time. Considering losing the support and love of family is a threatening prospect, and its likelihood should be assessed when clinicians are in the earlier stages of discussing the coming out process. In the most severe cases, this depression can lead to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and/or self-destructive behavior (Davies & Neal, 1996). In the face of these issues, clinicians should help their clients identify positive aspects of them identifying as LGBTQ+. While there are of course negative aspects, it is recommended that a focus be placed on positive aspects in order to reduce feelings of depression and increase the likelihood of clients integrating their LGBTQ+ identity. When working with clients during the coming out process, it is crucial for them to have established healthy coping skills and social support (Ali & Lambie, 2019). A strengths-based group counseling intervention was found to be helpful for LGBTQ+ individuals during their coming out process (Ali & Lambie, 2019). Participants mentioned that sharing of information and experiences, modeling, and validation were highlights of the group intervention (Ali & Lambie, 2019). The group was found to be a safe environment for clients to process their identities while feeling a sense of togetherness with others who were also coming out at the same time (Ali & Lambie, 2019). Overall, a strengths-based group therapy intervention was found to be a helpful   53 and positive experience for participants who were going through the coming out process (Ali & Lambie, 2019).   Alderson (2013) found that individuals who were rejected by their families after coming out experienced worse health outcomes compared to those who were accepted by their families. Page (2014) determined that parental rejection has been associated with “maladjustment, risky sexual behavior, increased substance use, victimization, violence, and suicidality” that can last well into adulthood (p. 1). Page (2014) found that familial rejection also increased one’s likelihood of experiencing depression, anxiety, decreased self-esteem, and other mental health symptoms. Goldfried (2001) asserted that parental support served to significantly reduce psychological symptomatology. Bohan (1996) discovered that approximately half of the violence that occurs against LGBTQ+ individuals comes from their own family members. As a result, it is important to consider issues of safety and anticipated reactions when clients think about coming out to their families. Additionally, it is important to discuss what the worst-case scenario would look like in order to further prepare your client for the reality of their coming out to family and loved ones (Alderson, 2013). Johnson et al. (2019) reported that LGBTQ+ youth who have supportive families have better overall psychological well-being compared to LGBTQ+ youth who experience familial rejection.  Ideally, clients will move into a phase of coming out where they have pride in their LGBTQ+ identity. They may reject society’s messages about the normality of heterosexuality and cisgender identities and proceed to embrace their LGBTQ+ support system. It is worth noting here that during this time, clients may also express feelings of anger towards heterosexuals and society at large for the discrimination and prejudice they   54 have experienced. Often, these contrasting feelings of pride and anger can lead to LGBTQ+ activism and an identity as an activist.  Finally, it is hoped that clients will move into a phase where they fully integrate their sexual and/or gender identity into their overarching sense of self (Van Zyl, 2017). Upon having repeated positive experiences with heterosexuals, clients often see that many heterosexuals are not overtly hostile and do not support homophobia, biphobia, and/or transphobia. Clients in this phase often see similarities between themselves and heterosexual and cisgender people while still acknowledging the differences between them. However, it is unreasonable to expect clients to ignore the power differential between themselves and heterosexual, cisgender people.  When working with clients during their coming out process, it is unlikely that you will only encounter cisgender clients. You may work with clients who identify as gender fluid, which “extends beyond behavior and interests to the experience of multiple, and sometimes contradictory, gender identifications” (Clarke et al., 2010, p. 153). As might be expected, these instances can make the coming out process a more complex and at times confusing process.  Another crucial consideration in the coming out process is the fact coming out is never a one-time experience (Butler, 2010). Rather, LGBTQ+ people experience coming out as an ongoing event that continues to occur across the lifespan (Clarke et al., 2010). As a result of the various conditions at play in different contexts of their lives, it is not uncommon for some clients to be out in some contexts and to choose not to disclose their sexual and/or gender identity in others.    55 Whenever clients come out within the context of therapy, Chazin and Klugman (2014) recommend that clinicians communicate acceptance regarding their sexual and/or gender identities, share appreciation of the difficulty associated with coming out, and gather information about their client’s developmental and interpersonal history. The overarching goals of this response are to foster a trusting and collaborative relationship that would guide the rest of treatment. It is also worth noting that a clinician’s acceptance of a client coming out can help clients feel more motivated to come out to others (Chazin & Klugman, 2014).  Role of Intersectionality in LGBTQ+ Affirming Therapy When considering the role that intersectionality plays in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals and the utilization of affirming therapy, it is also important to consider the impact of having little to no research that includes LGBTQ+ people of color (Clarke et al., 2010). Crenshaw (1989) posited that “no single element of identity, be it race, ethnicity, class, disability, gender, or sexual orientation can truly be understood except in relation to the others” (p. 145). When using one’s intersecting identities to gain a deeper and more holistic understanding of them, Nadal et al. (2015) suggest that clinicians “understand how these identities sometimes conflict with each other and sometimes can even complement each other” (p. 154). Clarke et al. (2010) stated that there were “significant gaps in our knowledge about the lives of BTQ (Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer) people,” and LGBTQ+ people who “experience both heterosexism and social marginalization relating to race, culture, gender, old age, disability, rural isolation, social class, and poverty” (p. 21). Moradi et al. (2010) found a similar lack of visibility when researching studies conducted with gay people of color. Between 1998 to 2007, Huang et   56 al. (2010) found that “only two nationally representative studies were undertaken regarding LGB individuals” (p. 70). Based on this literature review, it is likely that these gaps still exist, especially when considering the lives of LGBTQ+ people of color.   Parmenter et al. (2021) demonstrated that “various co-constructed systems of oppression intersected to further isolate, exclude, and disenfranchise LGBTQ+ people of color from the mainstream white LGBTQ+ community” (p. 9). This furthers the point that focusing on only one cultural identity ignores so many lived experiences of clients, especially LGBTQ+ people of color (Parmenter et al., 2021). In the context of therapy, LGBTQ+ people of color reported that clinician recognition of intersectionality allowed them to “feel seen in a holistic manner” (Parmenter et al., 2021, p. 9). It was also determined that “connecting with other LGBTQ+ people of color” was associated with improved overall well-being for LGBTQ+ people of color (Parmenter et al., 2021, p. 9).   Inclusion of LGBTQ+ people of color in research is crucial because there can be significant differences in their experiences compared to white LGBTQ+ individuals. Many studies assert that gay people of color have difficulty “integrating two minority identities” (Alderson, 2013, p. 41). Flores et al. (2009) found that African and Latino American men attracted to other men were less likely to identify as gay and more likely to report internalized homophobia compared with gay white men. When comparing rates of coming out between white people and people of color, people of color are less likely to be openly LGBTQ+ to their parents (Grov et al., 2006). Bowleg et al. (2003) determined that Black lesbians reported experiences of triple jeopardy due to the stress they experienced due to having Black, lesbian, and female identities. Interestingly, Rostosky   57 et al. (2008) reported that almost half of the participants asserted that they experienced more stress due to their sexual identities rather than their racial identities.   As might be expected, there are several studies supporting the fact that LGBTQ+ people of color experience even greater health disparities compared with white LGBTQ+ individuals. Camarena and Rutter (2015) reported that African American LGBTQ+ individuals are vastly overrepresented in HIV/AIDS rates. As a result, it is crucial to have discussions regarding safer sexual experiences with all clients, especially with LGBTQ+ people of color. Compared to white LGBTQ+ individuals, LGBTQ+ people of color are “exposed to greater heterosexist stigma” (Muraco, 2014, p. 26). When working with LGBTQ+ people of color, Balsam et al. (2011) and Camarena and Rutter (2015) recommend discussing minority stress in order to reduce psychological distress and sexual health disparities. Similarly, Camarena and Rutter (2015) suggest that said psychological distress could be minimized using concrete coping skills.   When considering theoretical underpinnings to utilize when working with LGBTQ+ people of color, Camarena and Rutter (2015) advocate for the use of feminist theory because it emphasizes client empowerment and addresses the impact of societal oppression. Feminist approaches analyze experiences of power and oppression in the lives of clients and work collaboratively to challenge oppressive environments, which includes analyzing the power dynamics between the clinician and the client (Camarena & Rutter, 2015). Once this analysis has begun, an important next step is to discuss systemic underpinnings of clients’ distress and to help clients feel a greater sense of power in their newly integrated identities (Camarena & Rutter, 2015). Additionally, it is important to analyze messages regarding gender roles, power, and privilege that clients have   58 internalized. Camarena and Rutter (2015) also suggest that narrative and cognitive interventions could be integrated into a clinician’s feminist theory work when working with LGBTQ+ clients of color. “The power of the intersectional lens is the way it frames individuals’ experiences of identity and power as complex, dynamic, subjective, and specific, rather than as single-axis, static, autonomous, and generalized” (Addison & Coolhart, 2015, p. 440). Additionally, it is important to consider how the various identities of clinicians interact and overlap with those of LGBTQ+ clients. Addison and Coolhart (2015) advocate for “looking at the intersections of multiple identities” (p. 442) in order to better conceptualize the experiences of LGBTQ+ clients in therapy.   In 2013, Bowleg conducted a qualitative research study with 12 Black gay and bisexual men regarding their experiences with intersectionality. One participant explained that it would be difficult to separate his race, gender, and sexual identity because he does not experience life through exclusive and distinct identities (Bowleg, 2013). The researchers characterized the importance of intersectionality by stating “focusing on a single category obscures the depth of understanding provided by that category’s intersection with other categories” (Bowleg, 2013, p. 758). Interestingly, 83% of participants ranked their identity as Black as their primary identity rather than their gender or sexual identity (Bowleg, 2013). It is important to keep in mind that cultural identities are socially constructed via power relations and can differ significantly across geographic locations. One participant noted that “negative stereotypes associated with Black men often overlapped with those held of gay people” (Bowleg, 2013, p. 760), such as promiscuity and incapable of sustaining long-term romantic relationships.    59  Meyer (2015) conducted extensive research in order to determine what experiences LGBTQ+ individuals were having with violence and the impact that intersecting minorities can have in violent experiences. He found that “racism, sexism, and social class inequality continue to affect what individuals encounter in their daily lives, including forms of violence” (Meyer, 2015, p. 4). History has demonstrated that cases of violence involving white LGBTQ+ individuals have received significantly more media coverage than instances involving LGBTQ+ people of color (Meyer, 2015). This is especially concerning given the fact that LGBTQ+ people of color experience violence at higher rates than white LGBTQ+ individuals (Meyer, 2015). Meyer (2015) also demonstrated that LGBTQ+ individuals of lower socioeconomic status were more likely to experience violence compared to their higher socioeconomic status peers. Overall, Meyer (2015) reported that queer people are “privileged and disadvantaged in significant ways based on their social position” (p. 13).   In 2011, Balsam et al. (2011) created the LGBT People of Color Microaggressions Scale based on a three-phase, mixed method empirical research study. They were able to assess the frequency and distress caused by microaggressions experienced by LGBTQ+ people of color (Balsam et al., 2011). Through factor analysis, three domains of microaggressions were found: “racism within LGBT communities, heterosexism within racial/ethnic communities, and racial/ethnic discrimination in dating and close relationships” (Balsam et al., 2011, p. 171). Results indicated that microaggressions were associated with depression and perceived stress and that different types of microaggressions led to different effects (Balsam et al., 2011).    60 When providing LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, Haldeman (2007) emphasizes the fact that some LGBTQ+ individuals may struggle with marginalization within the LGBTQ+ community due to their racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic identities. This should be kept in mind especially when considering that not every LGBTQ+ client will be able/willing to become part of alternative sexual identity communities.  Minority Stress Model & Resilience  In 1995, Meyer created the minority stress hypothesis, which suggests that individuals who possess minority identities may experience increased stress and mental health symptoms due to the discriminatory and prejudicial experiences that take place when living in the dominant culture. This hypothesis includes three major components: internalized homophobia, stigma or expectations associated with discrimination, and encountering experiences that reinforce anticipated discrimination (Meyer, 1995). Breslow et al. (2015), Muraco (2014), and Westcott (2020) found that experiencing discrimination, prejudice, and victimization are all associated with increased psychological distress, substance abuse, and suicidality. Another common experience that increases minority stress is the devaluation of same-sex couples and same-sex parents (Muraco, 2014). Lindstrom et al. (2020) also demonstrated that sexual minorities have a storied history of experiencing more stress and marginalization than do heterosexual individuals. Relating to LGBTQ+ affirming care, the APA (2009) found that the minority stress model “provides a framework for considering the social context of stress, distress, coping, resilience, acceptance, and goals of treatment” (p. 17).   In 2018, Smalley et al. addressed the importance of LGBTQ+ health, including the impact of minority stress, barriers to accessing care, and evidence-based approaches   61 for improving health care while also reducing minority stress. Their research indicated that GSM individuals are less likely to seek and access ongoing health care due to “experience-based fear and mistrust of the medical community” (Smalley et al., 2018, p. 4). This fear is affirmed by the fact that, though the Affordable Care Act provided federal protection of gender identity-based discrimination, this protection only applies to institutions that receive federal funding (Smalley et al., 2018). “56% of sexual minority adults and 70% of transgender individuals report experiencing discrimination in health care settings” (Smalley et al., 2018, p. 18). As LGBTQ+ people endure negative health care experiences, they are more likely to avoid seeking care in the future (Smalley et al., 2018). Smalley et al. (2018) reported that over 67% of GSM individuals reported experiencing discrimination in their personal lives and 15-43% experienced it in their professional lives. Even worse, transgender individuals reported that 90% of them had experienced discrimination at work (Smalley et al., 2018). These experiences of discrimination are clearly experiences that can increase minority stress and decrease overall psychological functioning and well-being.   Protective factors related to minority stress have also been explored. Research findings indicate that people who report consistent social support experienced reduced minority stress compared to those without social support (Job & Williams, 2020; Muraco, 2014). The APA (2009) asserted that one’s collective identity can reduce the impact of minority stress and is more effective at reducing this impact compared to individual factors like coping skills, resilience, and optimism. Job and Williams (2020) determined that reaching out to social supports during times of distress also improved physical health. Interventions created for use with romantic relationships were found to increase   62 relationship satisfaction and mitigate the impact of minority stressors (Job & Williams, 2020).   Resilience is an emerging area in mental health research that has grown in popularity over recent years. Bartos and Langdridge (2019) researched the intersection between resilience and LGBTQ+ research by conducting a meta-analysis of 21 qualitative studies about the hardships faced by the LGBTQ+ community. They produced a unique and insightful definition of resilience as it pertains to LGBTQ+ individuals: “resilience is thus not about a return, but instead an adaptive innovation in living in the face of ongoing social threat and stress” (Bartos & Langdridge, 2019, p. 243). This clarification was provided as a response to common views of resilience as being able to ‘bounce back’ after a stressful experience. Additionally, Bartos and Langdridge (2019) uncovered countless stories of LGBTQ+ resilience that “involve an active sense of agency” (p. 244). Examples were also given as to what innovative resilience looks like for LGBTQ+ individuals and included the concept of families of choice and relationship diversity (Bartos & Langdridge, 2019).   Woodford et al. (2018) reported that resilience in LGBTQ+ college students was associated with decreased risk for suicide. Conversely, students with lower levels of resilience were more likely to experience interpersonal microaggressions and to conceptualize these experiences as more damaging than individuals with higher levels of resilience (Woodford et al., 2018). Breslow et al. (2015) determined that resilience was highly associated with a lower degree of psychological distress. Overall, these results indicate that increasing resilience among LGBTQ+ students can lower their risk for experiencing depression and suicide attempts (Woodford et al., 2018).   63  In 2019, Schmitz and Tyler interviewed 46 LGBTQ+ young adults about their experiences with resilience through challenging experiences. Results revealed that resilience-building experiences were associated with improved mental health and safe coping strategies (Schmitz & Tyler, 2019). Participants reported how important it was for them to establish or maintain their own self-confidence in their sexual and/or gender identity (Schmitz & Tyler, 2019). Many individuals shared that they experienced a high degree of support and acceptance on their college campuses, which improved their resilience and responses to challenging identity-related situations (Schmitz & Tyler, 2019).  Another emerging area in LGBTQ+ mental health research is the importance of resilience in living through the current COVID-19 pandemic. Gonzalez et al. (2021) interviewed 129 LGBTQ+ individuals who shared their experiences with resilience throughout the pandemic. This research is especially important because of the fact that LGBTQ+ people have been disproportionately impacted by health epidemics in the past, namely AIDS (Gonzalez et al., 2021). Participants reported that “overcoming difficult experiences, radical acceptance, self-reliance, and community support helped them build resilience and use their resilience to better navigate the COVID-19 pandemic” (Gonzalez et al., 2021, p. 139). LGBTQ+ participants also indicated that their experiences of turning inward and enjoying time with themselves as part of being marginalized may have allowed them to be less negatively affected by social distancing (Gonzalez et al., 2021). Another common finding was that LGBTQ+ people continued to find community online throughout the pandemic, which was a consistent part of their lives prior to the pandemic   64 since online communities are “safer alternatives to in-person spaces, particularly for people who might not be publicly out” (Gonzalez et al., 2021, p. 140).  Discussion Whenever people identified as LGBTQ+ in the past, many times the response by religious and conservative individuals was for them to engage in conversion therapy. However, studies conducted over the past 25 years have indicated that conversion therapy has been repeatedly associated with increased depression, anxiety, and suicidality and decreased self-esteem, self-worth, and overall psychological well-being. As of February 2022, there are still no studies that empirically support the use of conversion therapy. Studies that have supported the use of conversion therapy in the past have been found to involve significant methodological flaws. Overall, the methodological flaws of conversion therapy studies include an inability to make causal claims due to internal validity concerns, lack of construct validity, issues with conclusion validity, use of unreliable measures, small and narrowly stratified samples, and limited generalizability of findings (APA, 2009). Research on conversion therapy does not support the ability of such interventions to change one’s sexual attractions (APA, 2009). The majority of research on conversion therapy is based on a mainly white male sample of adults from strongly religious and conservative backgrounds and is thus not generalizable to LGBTQ+ individuals as a whole (APA, 2009).  Two common concerns that persist in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals are institutionalized and internalized homophobia. Institutionalized homophobia includes negative stereotypes about being LGBTQ+, a lack of LGBTQ+ education in schools, and a lack of LGBTQ+ media representation. Internalized homophobia involves the hate one   65 experiences in the world about LGBTQ+ individuals being turned towards oneself. It has been associated with social isolation, anxiety, suicide, and low self-esteem (Alderson, 2013; Hill, 2009).   In terms of psychological and emotional health of LGBTQ+ individuals, having a minority sexual and/or gender identity has been associated with significantly higher levels of overall psychological distress (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). This includes disproportionately high rates of anxiety, depression, suicidality, and substance use (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017; Lindstrom et al., 2020). These concerns help explain why so many LGBTQ+ people seek out mental health services, significantly more so than heterosexual and cisgender individuals.   Unlike CBT, Client-Centered Therapy, and Psychodynamic Therapy, LGBTQ+ affirming therapy is not its own system of therapy. Rather, it is a way of conducting therapy and of conceptualizing clients in a more culturally-informed and open-minded way. Key conditions of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy include a strong therapeutic alliance, respect, validation, and openness to discuss concerns regarding discrimination, oppression, and homo/transphobia. Affirming therapy involves establishing feelings of safety and security, helping clients to love and accept themselves, and helping clients integrate their LGBTQ+ identity into their overarching sense of self. In terms of empirically-based interventions, CBT, Positive Psychology, and strengths-based approaches at the individual and group levels have demonstrated successful outcomes. Since most clinicians will end up working with LGBTQ+ clients, they should receive education on doing so, just like they would for working with clients of other diverse   66 cultural identities. Clinician training and education has been found to increase clinician confidence and competence in clinical settings (Bidell, 2013).   A common concern when working with LGBTQ+ clients is coming out, especially because it is a process that occurs across the lifespan. Coming out is important to many LGBTQ+ people because it is associated with improved psychological functioning and relationships with loved ones. When working with LGBTQ+ clients in their coming out process, it is important to establish effective coping skills and strong social support (Ali & Lambie, 2019). Just as important, clinicians should prepare their clients for the possibility that they will not experience positive reactions when coming out to their loved ones. These situations are certainly ones where having a strong support system can have a protective effect.  Another important consideration when working with LGBTQ+ clients is the role of intersectionality or intersecting cultural identities. Clients do not experience life in separate identities, so why should clinicians treat clients as if they do? Race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, region, and sexual and gender identity combine to create an individual’s lived experiences. Sometimes one’s identities give them conflicting messages and sometimes various combinations of identities can make it difficult for people to find spaces where they can fully be themselves. The sooner this is realized and put into action on the part of the clinician, the better.   Finally, the minority stress model helps to explain how and why people with minority identities experience increased mental health symptoms as a result of experiences with prejudice and discrimination (Meyer, 1995). This model includes internalized homophobia, expectations of discriminatory experiences, and experiences   67 that reinforce one’s expectations of discrimination (Meyer, 1995). Additionally, the minority stress model helps to explain many of the barriers that LGBTQ+ clients face in seeking and receiving healthcare. Resilience has been established as a protective factor for minority identity individuals because it is associated with improved mental health and an increased likelihood of conceptualizing negative experiences in more manageable and less harmful ways (Breslow et al., 2015).  Although there have been many recent gains in acceptance and legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals, there is still a long way to go before true equality is fully achieved. Since discrimination, prejudice, and microaggressions are still part of everyday life for LGBTQ+ people and their mental health concerns continue to be a significant concern, it is imperative that the mental health field does its best to provide much-needed support. In order to do so, we as clinicians must make a concerted effort to provide affirming care by seeing homo/transphobia as the problem rather than identifying as LGBTQ+, not assuming that one’s LGBTQ+ identity is their presenting concern, demonstrating unconditional acceptance, and providing relevant resources and recommendations.          68 References Addison, S.

GSM individuals should also be included in basic health care coverage so that their needs can be met (Smalley et al., 2018). • When considering systemic barriers to accessing care, it is recommended that LGBTQ+ clinical and cultural competency be included in education for all health professionals, including continuing education experiences (Smalley et al., 2018). • In order to address environmental barriers to accessing health care, it is recommended that bathrooms should be gender neutral, materials displaying GSM people should be included, and documentation should include space on patient forms to indicate a wide variety of sexual identities, gender identities, and relationship statuses (Smalley et al., 2018). Client Conceptualization • When working with LGBTQ+ clients, it is crucial that providers consider the societal and institutional context that their clients have experienced (Smalley et al., 2018).  • Use client strengths to balance your understanding of the negative effects of marginalization and discrimination experienced by the LGBTQ+ community (Westcott, 2020).     90 Clinician Focused • Clinicians have an obligation to explore their own sexual identity and to feel secure in every part of their sexual identity prior to working effectively with LGBTQ+ clients (Davies & Neal, 1996). • Explore your own attitudes towards individuals of varying sexual and gender identities as a clinician before working with LGBTQ+ clients (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). • It is crucial for clinicians to be familiar with various resources and events for LGBTQ+ clients in their area so they can recommend various groups and activities, if necessary (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). • Use open-minded language that does not make any assumptions about one’s sexual or gender identities when working with clients during sessions (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017).  • Clinicians should address their own personal biases regarding sexual and gender identities prior to working with LGBTQ+ clients (Cramer et al., 2008).  • Training interventions for clinicians should focus on clinicians’ attitudes, especially regarding internalized homophobia and heterosexism (Alessi et al., 2016). • Avoid assuming that issues of sexual and/or gender identity (such as coming out or transitioning) are an LGBTQ+ client’s primary presenting concerns (Chazin & Klugman, 2014).  • Clinicians should consider the role that advocacy can play when working with LGBTQ+ clients. This involves assisting clients in identifying societal issues that   91 they would like to change, supporting those actions, teaching coping skills for issues that clients cannot change, and being aware of resources that are available (Pachankis & Goldfried, 2013). Discrimination, Prejudice, & Oppression • Clinicians should be aware of the reality that many LGBTQ+ clients have experienced some form of oppression related to their sexual and/or gender identity and the impact of that oppression varies considerably (Davies & Neal, 1996). • “Show willingness to discuss and point out ways that homophobia, heterosexism, and transphobia, along with other forms of discrimination and prejudice, affect the client’s mental health and intersect with current stressors” (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017, p. 952). • Research the sociopolitical oppression that marks the history of LGBTQ+ people and use that context to aid the accuracy of your clients’ conceptualizations (Moradi & Budge, 2018).  • Consider the fact that LGBTQ+ people as a group have experienced a significant amount of oppression over time at the individual, group, systemic, and institutional levels (Alderson, 2013).  • If indicated, discuss ways in which oppression has impacted the lives of LGBTQ+ clients (Alderson, 2013).  • When working with transgender clients, clinicians should aim to address the ways in which normative gender society has impacted their lives (Benson, 2013).    92  Environmental • Use inclusive and non-heterosexist language in verbal and written communication in your work as an affirming clinician (Alderson, 2013). • Use intake forms that do not assume one’s sexual or gender identities and include a space for clients to list theirs if they are not listed as options on the forms (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). • Provide gender neutral bathrooms within your clinical practice (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017).  • Including space for client strengths on intake forms can allow clients to focus on their resources as opposed to their deficits. This space could include specific questions, such as: “What are your greatest strengths?” “What strengths do you see in yourself in terms of how you connect with others?” and “What abilities or qualities contribute to your resilience?” (Westcott, 2020). Group Focused • Consider setting up a peer support group of LGBTQ+ clients for a wide variety of presenting concerns, depending on trends in client needs (Lloyd et al., 2021). • When groups are provided, emphasize the role that intersectionality plays in identifying as LGBTQ+. This opens the door for discussions about how each participant’s lived experiences differ even with a shared sexual identity and/or gender identity (Lloyd et al., 2021).   93 • When planning LGBTQ+ therapy groups, consider including discussions about how participants respond to oppression and discrimination in their daily lives (Lloyd et al., 2021).  Identity • If indicated, clinicians should discuss and question assumptions about identifying as LGBTQ+ (Davies & Neal, 1996). • “Staff should ask all clients about sexual orientation and gender identity. This prevents us from making assumptions” (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017, p. 951). • Include question about pronouns on intake paperwork (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). • Ask open-ended questions regarding the impact that gender, sexual identity, race, socioeconomic status, and other identities have had on your clients (Addison & Coolhart, 2015).  • As clinicians, strive to keep in mind the fact that LGBTQ+ individuals represent people across the spectrums of age, socioeconomic status, gender identity, ethnicity, race, and other cultural identities and the impact that such diversity has on them (Moradi & Budge, 2018).  • In order to start work with clients who struggle with internalized homophobia, clinicians are encouraged to provide an open-minded and nonjudgmental place for their clients to pursue identity exploration (Hinrichs & Donaldson, 2017). • Consider LGBTQ+ clients as unique individuals and take care to not generalize their experiences based on your knowledge about the LGBTQ+ community (Smalley et al., 2018).   94 • Keep in mind that clients are constantly impacted by multiple intersecting cultural identities that may conflict with each other at times (Smalley et al., 2018).  Interventions • When working with LGBTQ+ clients, it is important to balance openness with empirically informed interventions (Cerbone, 2020). • If primary presenting concerns include guilt and/or shame as a result of identifying as LGBTQ+, consider focusing on constructive ways to cope with these feelings. Establishing and maintaining supportive environments may also be helpful in these situations (Bybee, 2009). • Consider using expressive writing interventions when presenting concerns include stress, openness about sexual and/or gender identity, or internalized heterosexism (Smalley et al., 2018). • Clinicians should emphasize resilience in sessions with LGBTQ+ clients, especially when their presenting concerns are related to depression and/or suicidality (Woodford et al., 2018).  • Apply LGBTQ+ affirmative techniques and beliefs in your work with all clients, not a select few (Moradi & Budge, 2018). • Utilize positive affirmations with clients in order to reduce the negative impact of heterosexism (Love et al., 2014).  • Discuss the possibility of collaboratively establishing an individualized values system to further determine what being LGBTQ+ means to your client as an individual (Davies & Neal, 1996).     95 Support Systems • LGBTQ+ clients should be encouraged to establish, maintain, or expand an LGBTQ+ support system (Davies & Neal, 1996). • Discuss the importance of your LGBTQ+ clients becoming involved in LGBTQ+ community activities and events (Davies & Neal, 1996). • Use social support systems to increase clients’ psychological well-being (APA, 2009). • The use of mutual support groups is critical in reducing minority stress and feelings of isolation (APA, 2009). Therapeutic Relationship • Clinicians are encouraged to work with their LGBTQ+ clients to identify stereotypes of non-heterosexual/non-cisgender people and proceed to undo the negative connotations that are associated with such stereotypes (Davies & Neal, 1996). • Consider establishing a companion/peer-type of relationship with your clients in order to communicate that your clients are not inferior to you as the clinician (Davies & Neal, 1996). • Use your power as a clinician to affirm the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are reported by your LGBTQ+ clients (Davies & Neal, 1996). • Make sure to check in with clients in order to maintain rapport and catch any mistakes that may have transpired throughout client interactions (Smalley et al., 2018).     96 Appendix C Glossary Biphobia – Negative beliefs towards people who identify as bisexual that present as anxiety, aversion, discomfort, disgust, and/or fear of bisexual individuals.

Homophobia – Negative beliefs towards lesbians and gay men that present as anxiety, aversion, discomfort, disgust, and/or fear of lesbians and gay men. Homosexual – See Gay Institutionalized homophobia – An organization’s failure to provide appropriate service to people as a result of their sexual identity. It can be seen in attitudes and actions that lead to discrimination through prejudice, ignorance, and stereotyping.   97 Internalized homophobia – Negative beliefs about oneself as a lesbian or gay man that exists as a result of internalizing the negative beliefs that others and society and general have towards lesbians and gay men.  Intersectionality – When people are conceptualized as multiple identities occurring simultaneously in order to produce a coherent experience, rather than considering these different identities to constitute an additive model of identity.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in legal protections for and increases in social acceptability towards LGBTQ+ individuals, they continue to experience widespread prejudice and discrimination and seek therapy more often than their heterosexual counterparts as a result. As more and more LGBTQ+ people sought out therapeutic services, psychological research in the field of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy began to develop in order to meet these needs. Although the number of articles and studies conducted in this field has grown exponentially since the start of the 21st century, a sizeable gap between research and application remains. Research often provides vague suggestions without discussing specific clinical recommendations. Until discussion shifts to emphasize the practical aspect of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, the mental health needs of this large and diverse group of people will not be met. Therefore, the major goal of this project is to review the intersection of mental health and LGBTQ+ people over time and conclude with specific recommendations for providing LGBTQ+ affirmative care across a variety of presenting concerns and treatment settings. It is worth noting that LGBTQ+ affirming therapy is not a specific theoretical orientation or form of treatment on its own. Rather, it is a way of providing therapeutic treatment that takes into consideration the history of LGBTQ+ individuals, the impact of intersectionality, unique individual experiences, and affirms that nobody is less than anybody else, regardless of their sexual identity and/or gender identity. The cultural identities of our clients should be praised, encouraged, and used to inform how we provide mental health services. These conditions represent the heart of LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, which has the potential to have a significant positive impact on countless individuals who need our help as clinicians",
