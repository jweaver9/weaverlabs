IntroductionAs a technical and relational mode of state interventioninto property relations, social conditions, and majority‐minority interactions, urban planning is informed bynational and provincial/state legislative frameworks butalso by local political structures, histories, geographies,and moments of tension and collaboration (Cordes,2019). Urban planners in their various roles as tech‐nocrats,mediators, advocates, coordinators, negotiators,and visionaries, translate knowledge into action throughplans and policies (Barry et al., 2018). Nevertheless,how planning knowledge is produced, shared, and val‐ued, makes everyday geographies possible for some peo‐ple and forecloses them for others. This thematic issuefocuses onone such “hard‐to‐reach” (Beebeejaun, 2012),invisibilized and excluded citizenry within urban plan‐ning, the LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgenderand Queer) population. It addresses fundamental munic‐ipal governance dynamics about sexual and genderminority exclusions, representations, needs in urbanplans and policies, and attempts at more explicit prac‐tices of LGBTQ+ inclusion.Despite over a decade of research, LGBTQ+ urbanplanning issues have yet to be “mainstreamed” andevenly integrated into the everyday work of munici‐pal governance (Cooper & Monro, 2003; Murray, 2015).The scholarly planning literature has only begun toaddress how planning ideology and practices reinforcehetero‐cis‐normativies (Castán Broto, 2021; Doan, 2011,2015; Forsyth, 2001; Frisch, 2002). Planning scholarshipon LGBTQ+ populations has attended to the regulationof sexual premises and gay bodies through bar licencingand health clinics (Brown & Knopp, 2016; Prior, 2008),the hetero‐normativites embedded in municipal bylawsand housing policies (Hubbard, 2013; Oswin, 2019),but most research has focused on queer neighborhoodformation with recent critical attention to neoliberalnecropolitical displacements from urban spaces (Bell &Binnie, 2004; Gorman‐Murray&Waitt, 2009; Haritawornet al., 2014; Irazábal & Huerta, 2016). The decline ofthe “gayborhood” (Ghaziani, 2014) has stimulated urbanUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 145–149 145planning inventories of the LGBTQ+ “cultural infrastruc‐tures” of large global cities such as London (Campkin,2023) and the creation of “best practice” manuals suchas Planning Out’s (2019) LGBT+ Placemaking Toolkit.Recognizing that municipalities need to respond tonational equalities legislation and international humanrights declarations, inter‐municipal agencies such asthe UNESCO‐backed Canadian Coalition of InclusiveMunicipalities (2019) are also beginning to provide civicleaders with toolkits for LGBTQ+ inclusion.Building on this scholarly legacy and growing practi‐tioner interest, the current collection further questionsthe hetero‐cis‐normative assumptions of urban planningwhile also addressing the place of LGBTQ+ inclusionwithin municipal governance and the role of commu‐nity activism at city hall. It takes up Doan’s (2015) callfor a greater understanding and knowledge of LGBTQ+citizens and the need for inclusive queer urban spacesthat are joyful, equitable, and somethingmore than sitesof festivalized rainbow washing. Across three sectionsand via differently sized and regionally embedded urbancase studies (from Mumbai to Geneva, Windhoek andWalvis Bay to Los Angeles, Brighton to Acapulco, andOttawa to Vancouver), this thematic issue accentuatesthe lived disjunctures of municipal governance for sexualand gender non‐normative citizens. Discussion trains onLGBTQ+ inclusion in housing and community service pro‐vision, cultural and tourism policy, participatory and rad‐ical planning practices, advisory boards and strategies.2. Counter‐Hegemonic Reactions toHetero‐Cis‐NormativitiesPolicy, law, and municipal planning are important localforms of governmentality through which hetero‐cis‐normativities continue to be enforced, but they also pro‐vide the legislative frameworks through which LGBTQ+rights can be addressed (Cooper & Monro, 2003). Urbanplanning, however, needs to further disrupt long‐heldassumptions about what makes a “good” and “just”city beyond ordering land uses and services so as toreproduce two‐parent, heterosexual families withina gender binary that fortifies divisions between pub‐lic/private, formal/informal, institutional/commercial,propertied/tenant (Oswin, 2019). The three contribu‐tions in this section all work to counter this gender binaryand accompanying normativities by questioning assump‐tions about student housing, informal settlements, andthe radical potential of punk music culture.Residential space makes up a significant componentof land use in cities, rendering affordable housing akey queer urban planning and governance concern. Forqueer residents, private rental market housing does notnecessarily ensure privacy and safety. Arun‐Pina’s (2023)depiction of the “representational distortions” involvedin housing higher education students in Mumbai, Indiainvites urban planners to confront their regulatory rolein reinforcing the “cis‐heteronormative familification” ofthe urban housingmarket that reproduces a sense of per‐petual disbelonging for LGBTQ+ students. The heteronor‐mative assumptions permeating housing policies is alsothe focus of Delgado et al.’s (2023) Namibian case studyof housing injustices in rapidly urbanizing and econom‐ically unequal Windhoek and Walvis Bay. The orderinggaze of planners pushes LGBTIQ+ people and their com‐munities into informal settlements that, even withoutservices and security, afford relatively “safer” and moreaccommodating housing options that support alternatefamily structures.In addition to housing, cultural policy can also impactupon the vitality of marginalized communities and theinterstitial spaces of sociality upon which they depend.Gelbard’s (2023) article on the solidarities of punk andqueer refusal of displacement by creative placemak‐ing practices in Ottawa, Canada asks urban plannersto address participatory planning barriers and embracethe counter‐narratives of underrepresented communi‐ties when developing cultural policies and promotingsafety and inclusion. In the second section of this the‐matic issue, critical attention is directed to urban plansand policies that target LGBTQ+ inclusion within munici‐pal governance.3. Queering Plans and PoliciesWithin municipal governance, it is diversity committees,social planners, and cultural and recreational depart‐ments that provide key arenas for the integration ofsexual and gender minorities. Progressive municipalitiesincreasingly adopt anti‐discrimination ordinances, sig‐nal inclusion through Pride proclamations and supportfor festivals, offer sensitivity training for municipalities(Bain & Podmore, 2021a), create LGBTQ2S advisory com‐mittees (Murray, 2015), or adapt municipal facilities tomeet diverse gender needs (Patel, 2017). The process ofLGBTQ+ inclusion through municipal governance, there‐fore, involves community leaders, enfranchised insider‐activists and allied politicians and planners (Browne &Bakshi, 2016). The contributors in this section examinehow networks of LGBTQ+ knowledge production circu‐late in and out of city hall through the actions and out‐comes of individuals and groups striving for change andthe conflicts, impediments, and contradictions resultingfrom these transformative projects.Through a case study of Geneva, Switzerland, Duplan(2023) examines the governance–activism nexus thatbrings public officials charged with implementing legis‐lated political equality agendas into fluid allyship coali‐tions with LGBTQ+ activists. She asserts that while thespecter of pinkwashing looms large, this nexus increasesthe visibility of queer lives and improves access to publicspaces andmunicipal services. Smith et al. (2023) use theconcepts of “choreographing” and “non‐decision mak‐ing” in urban design and impact assessment to analyzehow the needs of trans people and communities arearticulated in municipal policy and practice in BrightonUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 145–149 146& Hove, England’s “LGBTQ capital.” To address ques‐tions of justice in municipal governance, Podmore andBain (2023) provide a case‐study analysis of the ten‐sions between contemporary planning’s civic actions ofLGBTQ2S recognition and its outcomes of redistributionfor three adjacent peripheral municipalities in Canada’sVancouver city‐region where an aestheticized rainbow‐washing politics sidelines more transformative socialinclusions. Moving from the periphery to Vancouver’scity‐centre, where the equity needs of transgender,gender diverse, and Two Spirit peoples (TGD2S) are pri‐oritized, Muller Myrdahl (2023) examines the civic adop‐tion of a 2016 trans‐supporting policy strategy. The arti‐cle questionswhat constitutes innovationwith respect tosocial inclusion policies. Taken together, these four arti‐cles interrogate how LGBTQ+ policy inclusions circulatethrough city hall and identify the key actors and munici‐pal arenas that bring forward or halt such policies acrossdifferent national contexts. Beyond advisory commit‐tees and insider‐activist advice on strategies and policies,planners have much more to learn from LGBTQ+ com‐munities in terms of organizing and providing services,developing radical planning praxis, and understandingthe impacts of policy on individuals and communities.4. Governance Coalitions and LGBTQ+ ActivismsIn the later half of the twentieth century, LGBTQ+activists in the large metropolitan centres of liberaldemocracies have explicitly worked to resist municipallogics of erasure and discipline, and in the process,built community resilience through the establishment ofgrassroots organizations, services and support agenciesand movements for human rights. Rather than simplyincorporating LGBTQ+ activist coalitions into municipalgovernance, the articles in this section suggest that plan‐ners and civic leaders can seek transformative inspira‐tion by way of such historical examples. There is, how‐ever, the perpetual danger of generalizing from specificand disconnected place‐based examples that emergefrom different political opportunity structures, resourcelandscapes and inter‐organizational relations (Bain &Podmore, 2021b). Moreover, the hand‐over of LGBTQ+service provision to the state and its ensuing bureaucrati‐zation within urban neoliberalism reinforces activist pro‐fessionalization (Browne&Bakshi, 2016) and reproducesthe homo‐cis‐normative inequities across the acronymthat compound exclusions for queer others (Haritawornet al., 2014). Neoliberal municipal regimes of consump‐tive respectability that figure LGBTQ+ inclusion as cen‐tral to their diversity brand, can also disempower activistcoalitions creating tensions, disconnections and mis‐recognitions (Bain & Podmore, 2021a).In their overview of American LGBTQ+ communityservice organizations (CSOs), Hess and Bitterman (2023)offer a taxonomy of community needs and analyzeLGBTQ+ services provision. They document how, dur‐ing the Covid‐19 pandemic, CSOs adapted their historicservices to meet the needs of vulnerable populationswhen governments could not keep pace, and, in so doing,re‐established themselves as anchors for gayborhoodcommunities. In contrast, the gay tourism destination ofAcapulco, Mexico, long‐exploited as a site of gay plea‐sure, exhibits, Payne (2023) argues, significant CSO gapsthat exacerbate “territorial inequalities” between queertourists and local residents. Despite the presence of anevolving LGBTTTI movement, queer locals continue toexperience a loss of social rights, a deepening of socio‐economic segregation, and an ensuing lack of politicalvoice within the urban governance frameworks of plan‐ning and policy.Nevertheless, the potential exists to politically lever‐age queer pleasure as an expression of queer joy.Analyzing the 50‐year history of the Los Angeles Prideparade, Turesky and Crisman (2023) provide a histor‐ical example of intersectional and insurgent planningwherein heterogeneous queer people organized theme‐selves and claimed agency. The event has createdemphemeral spaces for queer bodies to resist policing,collectively express queer joy, and, in the process, advo‐cate for more just cities.5. ConclusionsThe queer(ing) of urban planning and municipal gover‐nance is only partially underway in some “progressive”cities. It remains a highly localized, selective, and ad hocprocess that is all too dependent on the political willof civic leaders, the knowledge of urban planners, andthe resources available to local LGBTQ+ activists and resi‐dents. Themost common approaches to queeringmunic‐ipalities involve practices of queer infrastructure preser‐vation and rainbowization to symbolize civic recognitionof gender and sexual diversity, but these are only prelim‐inary transformative initiatives.Planners need to continue to think “beyond queerspace” (Doan, 2015, p. 257) since most LGBTQ+ pop‐ulations are more diverse, dispersed, and much lessvisible than the more enfranchised gay male popula‐tions who have built communities in the gayborhoodsof large urban centres. Despite such central‐city queerinfrastructure (both material and virtual), social isola‐tion, with its accompanying experiences of depression,addiction, and suicide, remain prevalent and should beof concern to urban planners along with complex andcross‐cutting issues of racism, ageism, surveillance, polic‐ing, and housing precarity. It also remains importantto push beyond the discursive analysis of planning’shetero‐cis‐normative assumptions about how LGBTQ+citizens live, work, travel, and socialize across metropoli‐tan areas (Doan, 2011), and view the various realms ofmunicipal governance as functionally intertwined ratherthan siloed. Without an intersectional lens, however, onthe challenges facing specific groups of LGBTQ+ popu‐lations across municipal governance—implicating hous‐ing, policing, income, poverty reduction or health ser‐Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 145–149 147vice delivery—any synergistic benefits will only continueto accrue for those within the acronym who are alreadymost visible and empowered (Irazábal & Huerta, 2016).AcknowledgmentsThe guest editors would like to thank all the authorsin this thematic issue for their contributions.
