However, there are still areas where discrimination is evident such as the workplace. Some lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender employees may not share their identity at work due to discrimination concerns. Such forms of discrimination may be passive acts such as microaggressions. These microaggressions can make work-life stressful; furthermore, the stress experienced at work may impact other areas such as home life. This study explored two areas. The first area investigated was whether identity disclosure at work affected workplace microaggressions. The sample size was 88 working adults who identified as cisgender and lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Participants completed an online survey posted through social media. The survey consisted of the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale and the Microaggressions Experiences at Work Scale. A multiple linear regression model assessed whether identity disclosure, specifically acceptance concerns and concealment motivation, could predict workplace microaggressions. Findings indicated the model was a good fit, and there was statistical significance for both acceptance concerns and concealment motivation as predictors for workplace microaggressions. However, acceptance concerns were the stronger predictor. The second area investigated relationship satisfaction with romantic partner. Sixty-two participants met the inclusion criteria, investigating whether acceptance concerns, concealment motivation, and workplace microaggressions could predict relationship satisfaction. The analysis was also multiple linear regression, and the model was determined to be a good fit. However, acceptance concerns were the only statistically significant predictor for relationship satisfaction. The findings provided insight on how lesbian, gay, bisexual identity disclosure and microaggressions spill into relationship life.    i                                                         ii THE IMPACT WORKPLACE MICROAGGRESSIONS HAVE ON THOSE WHO IDENTIFY AS LESBIAN, GAY, AND BISEXUAL.

treated as equal, no matter who they are or whom they love, we are all more freeâ (Obama, 2015). The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) population has experienced multiple obstacles and triumphs throughout history. One area that has undergone progress and setbacks in the past few decades is employment equality (Lloren & Parini, 2017). Employment policies regarding LGBT fairness are not always clear and have not gathered enough attention. When the government and policymakers collect engagement regarding inequality, it can be short-lived. Federal Policies for Fairness in Employment  Federal and state government policies have encountered progressive changes toward equality; however, those policies are not always fully enforced. Furthermore, policies are not always stable and tend to swing. During the Obama administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission indicated that discrimination based on sexual orientation was a federal violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Specifically, Title VII outlines areas that prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and national origin (Civil Rights Act, 1964). However, the Trump administration reinterpreted the sex discrimination clause and retracted protections for LGBT individuals (Feuer, 2018). Nonetheless, in June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court passed a decision to include LGBTQ protections under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. However, the act did not pass until February 25, 2021 (Warbelow et al., 2021).  State Policies and Fairness Discrepancies  In 2016, thirty states did not have protective policies for LGBT employees; however, that number had decreased by 2020. According to the 2020 State Equality Index, there was a reduction where 19 states were not expressive in prohibiting LGBT discrimination (Warbelow et 2  al., 2021). Although the recent index report indicates that more states promote protections, the LGBT population continues to experience prejudice. The discrimination experienced is not isolated to a specific context. In 2022, some states, such as Florida, prohibited disclosing LGBT persons in the school system with the âDonât say gayâ referendum (American Psychological Association, 2022). Although the context emphasized in this study is the workplace, the school setting example highlights how LGBT policies can go back and forth suddenly. Overview of LGBT Identity and Stigma  LGBT individuals encounter challenges developing a positive identity due to societal stigma (Mohr & Kendra, 2011). Furthermore, some LGB individuals have difficulties adapting to and affirming a stigmatized identity, which can impact interpersonal relationships and psychological well-being (Meyer, 2013). These individuals are often forced to grapple with when and where they can share their identity safely with others. One setting where LGBT individuals may invest significant mental energy and effort into sharing or withholding aspects of their identity is the workplace. However, certain qualities of a work environment could influence whether a person feels comfortable disclosing their identity to their peers. LGBT Identity and Work Settings  When work or corporate policies are created, not all minoritized populations are always considered. Policies are often created under heteronormative assumptions that could both directly and indirectly invalidate, stigmatize and isolate LGBT employees. Scholars have indicated that institutional practices are conceptualized from a heteronormative framework, and two processes occur: all people are assumed to be heterosexual, and sexual minorities are invisible (Herek, 2007). These biased assumptions frequently occur in work settings. Some individuals may feel pressured to conform to heteronormativity while at work. In fact, many LGB individuals do face 3  stigma of deviating from heterosexual norms, leading to fear of stigma and identity disclosure concerns (Mohr & Kendra, 2011). Negative or perceived negative bias may cause LGBT individuals to be private about their identity. Throughout history, multiple employment sectors demonstrated a negative bias toward LGBT workers, such as the federal government with the lavender scare and the military with the former policy of âDonât ask, donât tell.â Historical contexts may have shaped a negative bias toward non-heterosexual identities in the workplace. In response, some individuals may feel the need not to disclose their identity from others. The nondisclosure of identity can serve as a defense mechanism. Microaggressions  Although multiple civil rights movements from the mid- to late-20th century helped shape equality in sectors such as employment, discrimination continues to occur in the early 21st century. A recent study indicated that LGBT employees continue to report high rates of job discrimination, work stress, and mental health concerns (Moya & Moya-Gorfano, 2020). Discrimination can occur in multiple ways that are either obvious or muted. Overt acts of discrimination may involve acts of violence or derogatory comments. Covert acts of discrimination can be subtle; however, they come in multiple variations. These covert acts of discrimination are known as microaggressions. Whether intentional or nonintentional, the bias can place LGBT employees in an uncomfortable position in deciding to share their identity. Microaggressions have been defined as minor insults and passive actions intended to denigrate a person (Nadal, 2008). Scholars indicate that multiple exposures to microaggressions over time can deliver the same amount of harm or more significant harm than overt acts of discrimination (Nadal et al., 2011; Sue, 2010). Microaggressions happen in settings such as the 4  workplace. LGBT microaggressions can be overlooked due to workplace policies gravitating toward a heterosexist bias (Resnick & Galupo, 2019). Overview of Disclosure and Nondisclosure  Some LGBT individuals may want to avoid microaggressions and other forms of discrimination due to confrontation concerns. The avoidance of confrontation can lead to being private about sexual orientation identity. Literature regarding disclosure has been limited in recent years. Scholars have investigated factors that could impact LGBT identity privacy. One factor studied is the first experience stigma, which occurs when an individual has a negative experience disclosing their identity for the first time and has increased fear of disclosing their identity again (Chaudoir & Quinn, 2010). The fear of disclosing identity again may lead some individuals to conceal their identity. A recent study highlighted the inconsistencies of prior studies on whether identity disclosure promotes identity affirmation. Thuillier and colleagues indicated multiple factors occur when individuals decide to partake in identity disclosure. One factor is the present environment and current experiences. Another factor is the present situation, which involves the availability of social support and the involved stakes. A third factor is past experiences of disclosing identity, which help decide whether to disclose LGB identity (Thuillier et al., 2021). Perhaps a work environmentâs stance on inclusivity could facilitate or impede someone in sharing their sexual orientation. LGBT identity privacy has been investigated in prior studies. Mohr and Fassinger (2000) defined sharing and not sharing LGBT identity as disclosure and nondisclosure of oneâs identity. The construct of disclosure and nondisclosure has further expanded into a measurement scale defined by several factors such as concealment motivation and acceptance concerns (Mohr & 5  Kendra, 2011). The comfort level of identity disclosure can depend on the work climate. Factors that could foster identity disclosure are inclusive work environments that promote fairness through workforce policies. Some have argued that changes in inclusivity need to come at the state level, and others have argued at the federal level. As previously mentioned, the Supreme Court decision in 2020 indicated that discrimination based on sexual orientation was a violation of Title VII. However, the progress made with this policy is not distinctly clear. Also, as previously mentioned, microaggressions are forms of discrimination that could impact LGB employees but could be difficult to report to work officials. Limitations in Research  There have been a limited number of studies in recent years investigating LGBT identity disclosure. Sources available concerning identity disclosure took place earlier in the 21st century, such as Mohr and Fassingerâs (2000) study. Studies exploring LGBT workplace experiences have been stagnant in the past decade. However, as mentioned, multiple societal events could have altered changes in workplace policies. Those changes have not been explored sufficiently in recent years. This investigator has noticed gaps within years of publications. Specifically, studies within the past decade appear to be limited, and older sources have been cited due to such gaps. There also appear to be more sources available within specific employment industries such as federal agencies, law enforcement, and the military. This study was more generalized and not employment-sector specific. The findings of this study could help lessen the existing gaps in the literature. Statement of problem one: Does workplace discrimination still occur for LGB individuals? How do microaggressions impact oneâs satisfaction with their employer? Do acceptance concerns and concealment motivation impact workplace satisfaction? 6  Same-Sex Relationships Overview  An additional area that has undergone multiple changes is same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriages officially became legally available in all 50 states in 2015. However, the Respect for Marriage Act was enacted until December 2022. This act made same-sex marriage recognizable and voided the Defense of Marriage Act. The legislative stance could indicate society is accepting of such relationships. However, not all parts of society are accepting. Not all people and sectors agree with recognizing same-sex marriage. The lack of acceptance could cause individuals in a same-sex relationship to reveal less about their identity in settings such as the workplace. Couples who are open about their identity at work run the risk of discrimination at work, impacting oneâs mood at work and at home. Sensitivity to stigmatization and homonegative experiences can lead to poorer psychosocial effects in LGB relationships (Meyer, 2013). Same-sex couples are tasked with proving legitimacy of their relationships when heterosexual couples are not subjected to this invalidating experience. Identity Disclosure and Same-Sex Couples  Being in a relationship can impact identity disclosure. Studies have found that being in a relationship helped with greater outness, less internalized homophobia, and greater well-being (Savarese et al., 2022). This information suggests that those who identify as LGBT and are in a relationship may experience differences with identity disclosure. On the contrary, another study found individuals with higher internalized phobia were vulnerable to conflict and poorer relationship quality than individuals with lower internalized homophobia (Totenhagen et al., 2018). What remains unclear is whether being out helped with relationship quality or if the social support helped decrease internalized homophobia. 7  Work Stress Spillover and Couples  LGBT individuals may view the workplace as a stressor when a work environment does not promote inclusion of those in same-sex relationships. Furthermore, work stress can carry over to other areas of life, such as the household. Studies have shown that people cannot completely detach from work stressors, which can affect home life and couplesâ relationship quality (Debrot et al., 2018). Others have examined how work stress can also impact same-sex couples. Stigma remains a defining difference between heterosexual and same-sex couples, which may impact the couple where one person is not out in the workplace may lead to distress in the couple. Research has shown that support from work can positively influence relationships. Goldberg and Smith (2013) found that supervisor support was negatively related to mental health problems in lesbian and gay parent couples. An experience known as the spillover-crossover effect explores work stressâs impact on couples (Schaer et al.,2008). The act of concealing identity at work can also be seen as a work stressor. This study helped clarify whether workplace microaggression experiences can spill over into relationship life and impact the quality of relationships with same-sex couples. Statement of Problem Two  Does workplace satisfaction impact relationship satisfaction? Are those who are in unsupportive work environments experiencing difficulties because of work stress caused by LGB identity? Aim of Study  The primary purpose of this study was to explore the impact that identity disclosure had on work experiences, specifically microaggressions. Individuals who reveal their LGB identity may report more microaggression experiences. The study helped clarify whether outness can 8  serve as a predictor of workplace microaggression experiences. An additional area investigated was the effects of identity disclosure and workplace microaggression experiences on same-sex couples. The effects of outness, microaggression experiences, and relationship satisfaction can help illustrate the prevalence of discriminatory experiences. 9  Chapter II: LITERATURE REVIEW  Presenting Problem and Societal Shifts  The work setting has experienced multiple shifts across time, and one area that has changed and gathered focus is fairness to employees. Progress in workforce diversity in the 21st century includes equitable business practices and inclusive policies. Although organizations have focused on inclusive policies such as fairness to female and ethnic minority employees, additional marginalized populations could be overlooked, such as sexual minorities. The LGBT population continues to be subject to stereotypes and negative consequences, which have impacted their opportunities in settings such as the workplace (Buddel, 2011). Several states have noticed the unfair differences for LGBT employees and have begun to update workplace inclusion policies. Challenges with Noninclusive Work Settings  Statewide LGBT protective work practices have been gaining momentum; however, only 23 states in 2019 had protective policies based on the Human Rights Campaign State Inequality Index (Warbelow et al., 2019). The absence of LGBT inclusion policies in other states places LGBT employees at risk of encountering workplace discrimination. Studies indicate that LGBT individuals continue to report higher rates of discrimination, work stress, and mental health concerns (Moya & Moya-GarÃ³fano, 2020). These discriminatory experiences toward LGBT people can cause individuals to experience unwanted feelings such as fear. Fear can lead a person to be vigilant to surrounding potential threats. Researchers investigating hypervigilance in LGBT groups found that 39.9% of participants reported having hypervigilant experiences at work. That study also reported other emotions associated with hypervigilance, including anxiety, 10  stress, exhaustion, and shame (Rostosky et al., 2021). Noninclusive work environments can exacerbate perceived or actual perceptions of discrimination toward LGBT employees. Potential Benefits of Inclusive Work Settings  Work environments that promote inclusivity of LGBT workers can help decrease stressful, emotional experiences. Studies have investigated how some work climates can support LGBT employees. LGBT employees reported feeling less isolated and better in workspaces with supportive LGBT policies based on a study that explored diversity management (Lloren & Parini, 2017). A supportive LGBT work climate also predicted job satisfaction and âliving a calling,â according to a study investigating life satisfaction and job satisfaction in LGB populations (Allan et al., 2015). Fair business practices can be a form of inclusivity within the work context. In turn, inclusivity can help modify attitudes of acceptance for LGBT employees. The modified attitudes can help LGBT employees feel more comfortable with their identity within the work context. Work Satisfaction  Acceptance for LGBT coworkers can promote cohesion and be a form of inclusiveness. Researchers have further investigated several factors that could predict workplace satisfaction. According to a study surveying LGB employees, predictors for supportive work environments are support from supervisors, coworkers, and the organization (Huffman et al., 2008). The same study indicated that supervisor support was strongly related to job satisfaction, while coworker and organizational support significantly impacted life satisfaction. A federal agency study involving LGBT employees found that employees who perceived their work environment as fair, supportive, and empowering were less likely to turn over from their agency (Sabharwal et al., 2019). The mentioned studies indicated how supportive workspaces can lead to LGBT 11  employment satisfaction across several areas. However, the impact and understanding of unsupportive LGBT workspaces should also be considered. Factors contributing to unsupportive work environments can limit work satisfaction. Work Dissatisfaction  Other studies have investigated the effects of LGBT identity and unsupportive workspaces. A 2015 federal employee study found LGBT employees reported less satisfaction in workplace transparency in evaluations, unfair pay, discomfort with whistleblowing, and experiencing less respect from supervisors (Cech & Rothwell, 2020). Another federal employee study found that LGBT employees had perceptions of fewer opportunities to advance, felt less empowered, and were dissatisfied with peer relationships at work (Lewis & Pitts, 2017). Others have also reported that less job satisfaction was associated with discrimination experiences based on LGBT identity (Ragins et al., 2007). LGBT employees continue to experience challenges in work settings based on identity discrimination. Discrimination  An argument could be made about job dissatisfaction and discrimination experiences at work. Discrimination toward marginalized groups can convey a message that someone is not welcomed within a context. Victims of discrimination could feel hesitant to report discrimination due to possible concerns of further mistreatment from other workers. Discrimination can be conveyed through various forms of expression. Some acts of discrimination are overt displays of hostility, while other acts of discrimination are passive acts that may also cause harm to others. Some of these acts of discrimination can be more difficult to report. The following sections on microaggressions help illustrate the effects that microaggressions can have on LGBT employees. 12  Microaggressions  One classification of discrimination is microaggressions, which are subtle acts of discrimination such as insults and minor putdowns that demonstrate a negative bias or lack of sensitivity toward a group (Nadal, 2008). However, few studies investigating prejudices among LGBT individuals have distinguished between discrimination types. Microaggressions can be encountered in various ways, and scholars have classified microaggressions into several categories: microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations (Sue et al., 2007). Microassaults are language or actions that symbolize and promote inferiority. Microinsults are acts of exclusion, such as commenting that someone does not hold the stereotypes of their group. Microinvalidations are comments or actions that dismiss struggles encountered by a marginalized group (Sue et al., 2007). By classifying microaggressions into different categories, researchers could recognize and distinguish patterns of discrimination. The distinction of different microaggression types can also help others become aware of how commonly these forms of discrimination occur. LGBT Microaggressions  Most studies that investigate microaggressions have focused on ethnic discrimination. Studies investigating LGBT microaggressions have emerged; however, the focus has been on differences in subpopulations. One example included ethnicity within LGBT populations, and a study found themes related to prejudice against persons of color within the LGBT community (Balsam et al., 2011). Another area of focus with LGBT microaggressions has been discrimination experiences in healthcare settings. A study found that 53% of a sample consisting of 489 adults reported microaggression experiences based on LGBTQ identity (Casey et al., 2019). The mentioned study also found that one in six adults reported avoiding healthcare due to 13  anticipated discrimination experiences. However, LGBT individuals could find discrimination unavoidable in other contexts, such as in the workplace. An LGBT employee might not be able to avoid the workplace; however, they may avoid interactions with coworkers to avoid possible microaggression experiences. Workplace microaggression studies among LGBT individuals have started to come out in recent years. The Workplace  Some work cultures promote inclusivity, while other work environments do not emphasize LGBT inclusivity. Studies that examined the effects of workplace support and discrimination found that the higher an organizationâs diversity climate perceptions, the more employees felt that the organization cared about them (Stewart et al., 2011). A study found that more LGBT support at work was associated with less discrimination. Furthermore, the same study found that hostile work environments were associated with high levels of workplace discrimination (Holman, 2019). Others have also found other ways work climate can impact LGB employees, and one study found how internalized homonegativity and the effects of work stress had an impact on oneâs well-being (Singh & OâBrien, 2020). The studies described how supportive and hostile work environments contrast with discrimination experiences. To better understand workplace discrimination, researchers should closely examine specific types of discrimination experiences, such as microaggressions. LGBT Microaggressions in the Workplace  Although there have been studies investigating LGBT microaggressions, few investigated LGBT microaggressions within the workplace. Examples of prior findings are specific to a particular setting or occupation. For instance, a study focused on the relationship between LGBT-friendly policies and workplace diversity within business schools. The findings of that 14  study indicated that LGBT-friendly policies help promote the proportion of diversity among staff (Cook & Glass, 2008). Another study involving multiple federal agencies found that LGBT status was a negative predictor of fair treatment. Compared to non-LGBT coworkers, LGBT employees reported that work success was not fostered, and they felt less respected by their supervisors (Cech & Rothwell, 2020). The mentioned studies did not assess for influential factors such as outness. A study investigating LGBT workplace microaggressions found several common themes: work climate, organizational structure, and workplace policy (Resnick & Galupo, 2016). Resnick and Galupo (2019) wanted to gather further insight from those themes and developed the Microaggressions Experiences at Work Scale (MEWS). The MEWS assesses LGBT experiences in workplace values, heteronormative assumptions, and cisgender normative culture. There are few microaggression measures explicitly tailored for LGBT populations, such as the MEWS. Prior studies investigating LGBT microaggressions applied measures intended for racial discrimination and adapted wording to fit LGBT populations. One of the purposes of the present study was to apply a measure, the MEWS, to an LGB workforce-specific population. Microaggressions have been described as discriminatory and unfair business practices experienced by marginalized populations such as those identifying as LGBT. Those discrimination experiences can occur in various settings, such as the workplace. Some LGBT individuals may find the reason not to disclose their LGBT identity at work to avoid microaggression experiences. The rationale for sharing or not sharing oneâs LGBT identity with others has been described as disclosure or nondisclosure of identity. The benefits and drawbacks of identity disclosure in the workplace are not always clear, as studies have had mixed findings. The following sections highlight the variability of those findings. 15  LGBT Stigmatized Identity  Historically, LGBT identities have been stigmatized by society. During the 20th and 21st centuries, multiple events facilitated changes in recognizing these identities. Some of these events included laws that outlawed homosexuality, while other events, such as civil rights movements promoted equality. One argument that can be made about LGBT identity is that it is more accepted in present society. Prior studies indicated that coming out was associated with positive identity development (Ragins et al., 2004). Older studies indicated positive effects of disclosing LGB identity (Cain, 1991). However, others have also argued that LGBT individuals continue to experience discrimination. People who identify as LGBT may want to avoid microaggression experiences in familiar places such as school and work. Scholars have indicated that concealing or being out about sexual orientation is influenced by prior experiences (Thuillier et al., 2021). This concealment can be more prone to less accepting work environments. The workplace culture can influence how comfortable someone is with their identity within the work environment. Scholars have investigated the process of sharing or not sharing LGBT identity with others. One study involving interviews with gay and lesbian police officers found that those who were âoutâ were excluded from social events and those who were âclosetedâ indicated the need to keep their identity private to maintain their friendships at work (Miller et al., 2003). The choice of not disclosing LGBT identity at work with the example mentioned illustrates how someone could feel motivated not to share their identity to maintain cohesion with other employees. 16  Concerns About Sharing Stigmatized Identity  LGBT identity concealment has been associated with reduced feelings of belonging and decreased job satisfaction based on a study that asked participants to recall or imagine possible experiences where they revealed or concealed their identity (Newheiser et al., 2017). Others described how disclosing identity can cause LGBT people to be subject to discrimination. A focus group study that involved interviewing LGBT officers in the United States found that identity concealment was a mechanism to avoid harassment and unfairness at work (Mennicke et al., 2018). Another focus group study of LGBT employees found that members feared being ostracized at work and felt the need to circumvent conversations regarding their LGBT identity (Nygren et al., 2016). Hiding LGB identity can lead to defense mechanisms and could lead to behaviors such as being reserved about identity, or even self-isolation at work to avoid stigma. Other studies have indicated the possible consequences of disclosing oneâs LGB identity. A study that involved interviewing lesbian employees about stressful experiences found several common themes related to identity, which included termination for being out and feeling the need to hide aspects of intimate relationships in work conversations (Bowleg et al., 2008). Another study involving gay police officers found several themes during interviews (Collins & Rocco, 2015). One of those themes was that being out led to difficulty moving further in their careers; thus, not being out could be a motivator (Collins & Rocco, 2015). Scholars have indicated that individuals with stigmatized identities in work settings could experience barriers to advancement, be at risk for isolation, be stereotyped, and risk possible job loss (Clair et al., 2005). Consequences associated with identity disclosure may cause someone not to reveal their identity. 17  Although nondisclosure can serve as a protective motivator, other studies have found that nondisclosure can contribute to depression and anxiety. Lesbian women who did not disclose their identity reported having higher rates of depression and anxiety. However, the same study found that homosexual men who were not disclosing reported similar anxiety but a lower rate of depression (Pachankis et al., 2015). Supportive literature indicates that employees can have negative experiences when keeping their identity private and other negative experiences in sharing their identity with others. The choice to share aspects of identity is not always clear. The Disclosure Process  The disclosure of LGB identity is not an all or none concept and can be complex. Some scholars believe that identity disclosure can vary in context and could be understood as a range. Outness inventories were developed to assess being open with their identity in multiple areas of an individualâs life. In some facets of life, individuals can be open in disclosing their LGB identity, while someone could be apprehensive in other areas. Some individuals have delayed coming out at work due to homophobic views associated with their occupation. The coming out experience occurred in various stages, according to a study that consisted of interviews with openly gay sports journalists (Magrath, 2020). One of the themes of the study indicated that workplace culture served as a deterrent for coming out to colleagues. Another theme identified how coming out at work was a gradual process. Supportive environments can help ease the process of identity disclosure. LGBT supportive practices have also been linked with disclosure and authenticity at work (Fletcher & Everly, 2021). The process of identity disclosure can involve environmental and personal influences. A recent study explored factors that could impact disclosure at work. The study focused on how perceived discrimination and perceived risks of discrimination can influence whether lesbian and 18  gay workers decide to disclose their identity at work (Thuillier et al., 2021). One factor involved perceptions of personal life events and how this impacted bias. Scholarly work from others highlighted how perceived personal discrimination was related to less disclosure at work (Velez & Moradi, 2012). However, other studies described how social support could help with disclosure. Social support from family, friends, and coworkers and positive experiences of coming out could influence disclosure at work (Thuillier et al., 2021). Behaviors at work can be influenced by other areas of life, such as the input and evaluation from family and friends. A heterocentric work setting may view LGB sexual orientation as abnormal; however, other areas of life, such as friendships, can normalize a personâs LGB identity. The same could occur for work settings that promote inclusivity, which may not view LGB identity as abnormal. One of the findings in Thuillierâs study was that favorable workplace experiences predicted positive disclosure of coming out, but negative experiences did not predict disclosure at work. A regression analysis indicated that the relationship of disclosure depends on earlier experiences of coming out in other life settings. Outness Inventories  Prior life influences and support can influence oneâs openness to disclose oneâs LGBT identity. Outness inventories are not always sensitive and can view outness as a clear yes or no. Some outness inventories have been used as a screening tool to assess whether an individual meets LGBT criteria for a study, such as confirming being out as yes or no, while other studies defined outness as a range. The Outness Inventory developed by Mohr and Fassinger (2000) assesses how open lesbian and gay individuals are about their sexual orientation. This inventory assesses for outness to specific figures such as peers and other areas of life. These other areas of life have been classified into three domains: out to family, out to world (e.g., friends, 19  supervisors, strangers), and out to religion (Mohr & Fassinger, 2000). Identity disclosure is a rather complex concept that involves several factors. Mohr and Fassinger later developed the Lesbian and Gay Identity Scale; however, the scale had wording that was not inclusive for those identifying as bisexual. The scale has been revised to be more inclusive for those who identify as bisexual, provide updated culturally sensitive language, and include constructs such as identity affirmation and identity centrality (Mohr & Kendra, 2011). The construct of identity affirmation is the association of positive thoughts and feelings with sexual orientation and membership in the LGB community. A component of identity centrality is acceptance concerns related to perceived public affirmation. Another component of identity centrality is concealment motivation, which intends to keep oneâs identity private. LGBT individuals could continue to encounter microaggression experiences at work. However, multiple factors such as outness can influence the prevalence of microaggression experiences. Disclosure of identity can serve as either a motivator or deterrent for some individuals. Thus far, identity disclosure has been explained as occurring as a range as opposed to being an all or nothing concept. This study helped clarify how much of an effect identity disclosure has on microaggression experiences at work. While identity disclosure and microaggressions can impact work life, areas outside of work can also be affected. Work Stress and Home Life  Negative work experiences can impact well-being at work, and those negative experiences can also influence factors such as home life. Studies have investigated the carryover effect, which occurs when stress impacts relationships (Carnes, 2017). Researchers have continued investigating this work stress carryover effect, known as the spillover-crossover model 20  (Demerouti et al., 2005). One study investigated how role stressors and role overload impact married couples. Specifically, the study investigated how heterosexual couples interacted with each other based on role stressors and role overload. The findings indicated that work stress harms the spousalâs emotions; however, that effect could diminish through coping mechanisms on how to deal with work stress. Additionally, the study indicated that men and women have different ways of dealing with work stress (Carnes, 2017). Others have indicated that the emotional depletion from work stress can lead to lower psychological resources in providing support (Cheng et al., 2014). Other studies have investigated how work stress impacted relationship satisfaction among married couples. One factor related to work stress is job insecurity, and a study found as job insecurity concerns increased, couple relationship satisfaction decreased (Blom et al., 2020). Multiple categories fall within job insecurity, such as work culture, turnover, and work demands. Work Stress and Home Life for Same-Sex Couples  The research available for same-sex couples examining the spillover-crossover effect has been limited. One study investigated the spillover-crossover effect and lesbian and gay identity disclosure, work satisfaction, and family satisfaction. Specifically, the investigated factors were work-family conflict and family responsibilities interfering with work. The investigators believed job demands of hiding oneâs traits at work, such as sexual orientation, could lead to depleted resources that spill over into home life. The crossover occurs when stress and strain transmit to the partner. This indirect strain impacts interpersonal interactions, social support, and communication among partners. Employeesâ disclosure to a supervisor was negatively related to their partnerâs âfamily interference with workâ and positively related to family satisfaction. The findings also indicated that less disclosure to a supervisor or coworker was associated with a 21  partner having increased family interference with work and decreased family satisfaction (Williamson et al., 2017). The studyâs findings were specific to family satisfaction and not coupleâs satisfaction. Social Support and Same-Sex Couples  Social support is a construct that has been widely defined to describe social relationships. The convoy model has described social support as characteristics related to the types of support exchanged, including affection and affirmation (Antonucci et al., 2019). Other models indicate that social support can protect an individualâs well-being from the adverse effects of stress. Results from a study indicated that social support from family and friends was related to well- being; however, the support provided by oneâs romantic partner buffered well-being from the adverse effects of stress. The buffering effect appeared to be beneficial to relationship quality for couples (Graham & Barnow, 2013). The increase in social support has been correlated with increased levels of relationship and personal satisfaction (Gallor & Fassinger, 2010). A study involving surveying themes from same-sex couplesâ stories indicated that as oppression increases in an environmental context, couples become closer and more committed to the relationship (Frost, 2013). Social support could mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. However, does this stressor impact relationship quality?  Relationship Satisfaction and Relationship Quality  Researchers have described relationship satisfaction as the interaction between oneâs acceptance of their partner and the partnerâs felt acceptance (Rossman et al., 2022). Sexual minority stress can impact relationship quality, and studies have explored this from an intrapersonal perspective. A study designed to investigate how couple dyad interactions differed from discrimination experiences found that higher levels of individual discrimination were 22  associated with difficulties with relationship adjustment and negative communication. The study also found that higher levels of sexual identity disclosure were associated with higher levels of positive communication among partners (Scott et al., 2021). Others also indicated that dyadic coping and communication can help with relationship quality among both partners (Donato et al., 2009). Social Support and Relationship Satisfaction  There is an interaction between social support and relationship satisfaction where the amount of social support provided can correspond to relationship satisfaction. Congruity of social support behavior between partners was an indicator of relationship functioning, according to a study investigating the influence of positive and negative interaction behaviors with married couples (Chow & Ruhl, 2018). Strong social support can come from external sources such as coworkers and internal sources such as a romantic partner. However, factors to consider are how outness could impact social support and relationship satisfaction. One study explored how outness and LGBT community connectedness predicted internalized sexual orientation stigma and relationship satisfaction. The findings indicated that a higher level of perceived social support and global relationship satisfaction corresponded to higher levels of outness, while lower levels of support corresponded to internalized stigma (Sommantico et al., 2018). Studies investigating LGBT couples have focused on relationship stage differences and have placed limited attention on external stressors that could impact relationship satisfaction (Macapagal et al., 2015). Such studies have focused on relational maintenance behaviors and relational outcome differences between male-male and female-female relationships. That study found communication differences by gender. However, such studies placed less emphasis on 23  external factors that could also be impacting a coupleâs relationship factors (Haas & Pachankis, 2021). External factors could include demanding areas such as work experiences. Measuring Relationship Satisfaction and Social Support  Relationship satisfaction has been measured in various ways for same-sex couples, such as understanding the effectiveness of therapeutic treatment. The Relationship Assessment Measure for Same-Sex Couples, developed by Burgoyne (2001), measures couples therapy treatment effectiveness; however, others have criticized that this measure does not fully explore same-sex couplesâ relationship satisfaction (Belous & Wampler, 2016). Other measures, such as the Gay Lesbian Relationship Satisfaction Scale (GLRSS), have been developed with language and differences unique to same-sex couples (Belous & Wampler, 2016). The GLRSS measures areas such social support from others and relationship satisfaction as measured through partner support. Measures developed for sexual minority couples have only been recently used in studies, yet the focus on LGB couples is still understudied. Workplace Experiences, Social Support, and Relationship Satisfaction  There have been few studies investigating same-sex couples and how workplace experiences have impacted their relationships. Some studies have investigated internalized homophobia, career development satisfaction, and dyadic adjustment among dual-earner same- sex couples. However, the areas of focus were individualsâ self-perception and not external factors that could contribute to internalized homophobia (Dispenza, 2015). Qualitative case studies had similar findings. In a case study, same-sex couples were interviewed and asked to describe their career experiences and relationship life. Several common themes emerged from the interviews. The workplace was described as a barrier where individuals described anxiety about how much personal information to reveal about their sexual orientation to others. Other 24  themes also indicated that confiding in select coworkers regularly decreased identity stress at work. Another theme included how affirmations helped promote identity interplay in the work world and personal world (OâRyan & McFarland, 2010). Supportive experiences could impact areas outside of work, such as partner relationships. Comfort level with identity disclosure can impact work experiences and possibly affect relationships at work. However, discriminatory experiences could deter someone from disclosing their identity in the workplace. These individuals could feel less supported at work. The lack of support can carry over to other parts of life. However, a supportive work environment could affect identity disclosure and impact relationship satisfaction. Therefore, it could be possible that there is a relationship among identity disclosure, work experiences, and relationship satisfaction. However, each of these areas could help predict how much of an influence one has on the other. 25  CHAPTER III: METHODS  Procedures  The National Louis University Institutional Review Board approved the study as of May 2021. Participants were recruited through weekly advertised posts on Facebook from June 2021 to May 2022. The posts contained a description of the study and a SurveyMonkey link containing a demographic questionnaire, three measures, and an LGBTQ+ mental health resource guide. To be eligible for the study, participants had to be 18 or older and needed to have career experience. Additionally, participants had to identify as cisgender, lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Transgender persons were not considered for the current study because the studyâs intended purpose was to assess the influence of sexual orientation and not gender identity in the workplace. A disclaimer was placed in the study description, which indicated that participants who had been in a relationship for six months or more during their employment could also voluntarily answer additional questions regarding the quality of their relationship. Data were collected over 10 months, from June 2021 to May 2022. Participants  Although 116 participants began the survey, only 88 who met full inclusion criteria and answered the measures completely for the first research question investigating LGB identity disclosure, and workplace microaggressions. Only 66 participants met inclusion criteria for the second research question investigating relationship satisfaction with a romantic partner. Measures  The investigators were granted permission to use published measures for this study via Rights Link for the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale (LGBIS) and the GLRSS. Permission was granted from Taylor and Francis to use the MEWS. 26  LGB Identity Disclosure  The study utilized the LGBIS as a screening tool in measuring outness. Mohr and Kendra described outness as a spectrum influenced by several factors (2011). Sexual orientation was measured using six items from the LGBIS. The items inquire about the extent sexual orientation was disclosed on a six-point scale, ranging from disagree strongly (1) to agree strongly (6). The measure contains nine subscales. Three items came from a subscale that assesses acceptance concerns. The acceptance scale was intended to measure public affirmation specific to acceptance concerns. The label for this subscale is the Need for Acceptance Subscale. Another three items came from a subscale that assesses identity disclosure. The identity disclosure scale that assesses motivators related to concealing identity was labeled the Need for Privacy Subscale. Other subscales from the LGBIS measure that were not included in the study were internalized homonegativity, identity superiority, and identity centrality. The investigators explored how acceptance concerns and privacy influence other measures (i.e., MEWS and GLRSS). The six items from the acceptance concerns and privacy scale were averaged, with 36 being the maximum score. Higher scale scores indicate more privacy and concealment motivation of LGBT identity. Workplace Microaggression Experiences  Workplace microaggression experiences were measured using the MEWS. The scale is a 27-item measure that assesses LGBT microaggression experiences an individual has encountered by a colleague, client, or other member of the work environment in the past 12 months. Items were measured on a five-point scale (1 = Never to 5 = A great deal). The measure comprises three subscales: workplace values, heteronormative assumptions, and cisnormative culture. Each subscale has a different range for scores where workplace values range from 12 to 60, 27  heteronormative assumptions range from 9 to 45, and cisnormative culture values range from 6 to 30. The sum of all scales was gathered for an average total where higher scores indicated an increased occurrence of microaggressions at work. The scale demonstrated adequate reliability of .90 for cisgender populations.  Relationship Satisfaction  Participants who identified as being in a relationship during employment were provided the option to answer additional questions regarding relationship quality. The relationship quality was gathered using a measure that assesses relationship satisfaction and social support. Relationship satisfaction was measured using the GLRSS. The survey quantitatively measures the amount of relationship and social support same-sex couples receive from their partner. The measure consists of two subscales, relationship satisfaction and social support. The survey is comprised of 24 items using a 7-point Likert scale: 0 = Strongly disagree to = Strongly agree. A total average score was gathered from the full-scale score. Higher scores indicated greater relationship satisfaction and higher social support. The scale demonstrated a reliability level of .82.  Data Collection  Data were collected through SurveyMonkey software and inputted and coded into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet documents. The Microsoft Excel spreadsheet documents were encrypted, and password protected. Data were coded and then analyzed using Jamovi statistical software version 2.2.3. 28  CHAPTER IV: DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  Research Question One  Does workplace discrimination still occur for LGB individuals? How do microaggressions impact oneâs satisfaction with their employer? Do acceptance concerns and concealment motivation impact workplace satisfaction? Null Hypothesis  Concealment motivation and acceptance concerns cannot predict workplace microaggression experiences more than chance alone. Alternative Hypothesis  Concealment motivation and acceptance concerns can serve as predictors of workplace satisfaction. The Sample for Research Question One  G*Power statistical software determined the appropriate size sample. The sample size determined to yield a medium effect was 68 participants, and the number for our sample was 116. However, only 92 participants met the inclusion criteria, and only 88 participants thoroughly answered each measureâs survey items. The four participants who did not fully answer items were excluded from the statistical analysis. The final sample size was 88 participants, and the alpha was set to .05, which decreased our chance of type I error. The obtained power with this sample size was .90. The sample comprised 63 cisgender males and 25 cisgender females aged 18 to 68. Although more than half of the sample identified as White, there were other ethnic identities within the sample, which are shown in Table 1. The population explored for the study were 29  sexual minorities, and most participants identified as gay; however, there were other sexual orientation identities, as indicated in Table 1. Most participants identified as employed n = 82; however, some identified as unemployed n = 5, and 1 identified as being laid off. There was variability with the range in years of education; however, most participants identified as having a bachelorâs degree or above for college education, as shown in Table 1. Table 1  Research Question One Demographics  Ethnicity n % White/Caucasian 57 64.80 Latino/Latinx 12 13.60 Black 5 5.70 Asian/Pacific Islander 3 3.40 Biracial: White/Latinx 3 3.40 Biracial: White/Native American 2 3.40 Multiracial: Asian/White/Latinx 2 2.30 Biracial: Asian/White 1 1.10 Afro Caribbean 1 1.10 Multiracial: Black/White/Latinx 1 1.10 Multiracial: Black/White/Native American 1 1.10 Sexual Orientation Gay  57  64.80 Bisexual 15 17.00 Lesbian 6 6.80 Bisexual and pansexual 6 6.80 Lesbian and gay 1 1.10 Gay, pansexual, asexual 1 1.10 Asexual homoromantic 1 1.10 Pansexual 1 1.10 Degree High school diploma  6  6.80 Vocational certification 5 5.70 Some college 10 11.40 Bachelors 35 39.80 Masters 25 28.40 Professional degree 7 8.00 31  Figure 1  Concealment Motivation Histogram  Note. The histogram in Figure 1 had a fair distribution for concealment motivation subscale scores. The image did not have a skew which does not indicate a violation. 32  Figure 2  Concealment Motivation Normal Q-Q Plot  Notes. The image displays a straight line with a slight curve. The lower-end and high-end values veer slightly away from the expected value line. This does not indicate a violation. Summary of Normality for Concealment Motivation  Most of the data indicated that the assumption of normality was met for concealment motivation except for kurtosis and the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. However, the histogram, as shown in Figure 1, and normal Q-Q plot, as shown in Figure 2, did not indicate major deviations. Linearity Assumption for Concealment Motivation  The relationships between two variables should be linear and not form a curve. 33  Figure 3  Linear Relationship Scatter Plot for Concealment Motivation  Notes. The scatter plot scores formed roughly a straight line and not a curve. This indicated that the predictor concealment motivation subscale score and measured variable, MEWS total score, have a linear relationship. The arrangement of scores was rectangular and concentrated on the lower center, and the relationship was somewhat positive. The assumption was not violated.  Homoscedasticity Assumption for Concealment Motivation  The variability of scores for concealment motivation was similar to the variability of scores for the MEWS dependent variable. Figure 3 also indicates a pattern that appeared to form a rectangular shape, and there were no major deviations or triangular pattern. The homoscedasticity assumption was met. Outliers  There did not appear to be major influence or deviations by outlier scores. 34  Figure 4  Concealment Motivation Box Plot  Notes. The figure revealed there were four outliers for the concealment motivation subscale. The four outlier scores were in the lower score range. Assumptions for Acceptance Concerns  Normality Assumptions for Acceptance Concerns  There did not appear to be a skew for acceptance concerns. The skewness was 0.03, and the z score was 0.13. The z score fell between â1.96 and 1.96. There did not appear to be a violation of skewness. However, the kurtosis was â1.06, and the z score was â2.09, indicating a kurtosis violation. This score could indicate an underestimation of the variance. The Shapiro- Wilk test was significant, p = .007, indicating a violation of normality for acceptance concerns. 35  Figure 5  Acceptance Concerns Histogram   Notes. The figure did not appear to be skewed for the acceptance concerns subscale, and the figure appeared fairly symmetrical. This did not indicate a violation. Figure 6  Acceptance Concerns Normal Q-Q Plot   Notes. The image roughly forms ed straight line where the predicted values line up closer to the expected values. This indicates there was no violation. 36  Summary of Normality Assumption for Acceptance Concerns  Most of the data indicated that the assumption of normality was met for acceptance concerns except for kurtosis and the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. However, skewness, the histogram, as shown in Figure 5, and a normal Q-Q plot, as shown in Figure 6, did not indicate major deviations. Linearity Assumption for Acceptance Concerns  There was a linear relationship between acceptance concerns independent predictor and the MEWS. Figure 7  Linear Relationship Scatter Plot  Note. The image was not curvilinear. Figure 7 indicates a positive relationship where higher subscale scores on the acceptance concerns predictor corresponded to higher scores on the MEWS. The linearity assumption was met. Homoscedasticity Assumption for Acceptance Concerns  Figure 7 has a pattern that forms a rectangular shape and not a triangular pattern. There do not appear to be major deviations. The homoscedasticity assumption was met. 37  Outliers  There did not appear to be major influence and deviations by outlier scores.  Figure 8  Acceptance Concerns Box Plot   Note. Most acceptance concerns subscale scores were concentrated toward the rectangular area; however, there appeared to be two outliers on the high end and three on the low end. Assumptions for the MEWS  Normality Assumption for the MEWS  The skewness for the MEWS was positive (1.10), and the z score was 4.28. This indicated a violation of skewness. Kurtosis for the MEWS was 0.94, and the z score was 1.84, which was not a violation of kurtosis. The Shapiro-Wilk test was significant as p = .00001. This indicated a violation of normality. 38  Figure 9  MEWS Score Histogram    Notes. The image appeared to be positively skewed for MEWS total scores. The distribution was not evenly spread, which was a violation. This indicated an overestimation of scores. 39  Figure 10  MEWS Normal Q-Q Plot  Notes. Scores started trending as straight lines, and a slight deviation occurred at higher values. The expected values generally lined up with the observed values. Normality Assumption Summary for MEWS  In concluding the normality assumption for the MEWS, areas that met the assumption were kurtosis and the normal Q-Q plot. The skewness, Shapiro-Wilk, and histogram did not meet the normality assumptions. The positive skewness indicated an overestimation of MEWS scores. Linearity Assumption for MEWS As mentioned, there appeared to be a positive linear relationship between the concealment motivation and the MEWS, as shown in Figure 3. There also appeared to be a positive relationship between acceptance concerns and the MEWS, as shown in Figure 7. The patterns do not appear curvilinear, as previously discussed in the linearity assumptions for concealment motivation and acceptance concerns, as depicted in Figures 3 and 7. There was no violation. 40  Homoscedasticity Assumption  The patterns generally appeared to form a rectangular shape and not a triangular pattern. There did not appear to be major deviations, as depicted in Figures 3 and 7. The assumption was met. Outliers  There did not appear to be major influence and deviations by outlier scores.  Figure 11  MEWS Box Plot   Note. The figure shows three outliers on the low end and six on the high end for the MEWS total scores. Linear Regression Assumptions for Research Question One  A multiple linear regression model was the appropriate statistic to address the first research question. Before assessing the multiple linear regression model for the goodness of fit, the linear regression assumptions were verified. The reliable social science equation determined the sample size, as Tabachnick and Fidell (2013) noted, N > 50 + 8m. The sample size required 41  was a minimum of 66 participants. Eighty-eight participants met the inclusion criteria and completed the surveys for workplace microaggression experiences. This assumption was met. Linearity: Multicollinearity Assumption There was no presence of multicollinearity with the predictor variables. There was not a high degree of correlation exceeding 0.7. According to Pearsonâs r, the correlation between concealment motivation and acceptance concerns was r = .46, n = 88, p < .001. The tolerance value was .79, indicating there was not a high degree of correlation with the independent variables. This suggested that multicollinearity was not present. The relationship between concealment motivation and acceptances concerns was within the acceptable range. Linearity: Singularity  There was no presence of singularity, as the independent variables were not perfectly correlated with one another. The relationship of the variables was < 1 and > â1 as Pearsonâs r = .46, n = 88, p < .001. The variance inflation factors (VIF) for concealment motivation and acceptance concerns were both 1.26, meaning there was not a high degree of variance among the independent variables. Homoscedasticity Assumption  The variance of the residuals about predicted dependent variable scores should be the same for all predicted scores. The residual scatter plots indicated a substantial difference between obtained and predicted dependent variable scores. The residuals formed a rough rectangular distribution. 42  Figure 13  Fitted Residual Scatterplot    Notes. There was no clear systematic pattern of the fitted residuals that deviated from the rectangle formation. The image was not curvilinear, indicating the assumption was not violated. 43  Figure 14  Concealment Motivation Residual Scatterplot    Notes. The scores were centered along the zero point. There was no clear systematic pattern of the residuals that deviated from the rectangle formation for concealment motivation subscale scores. The image was not curvilinear, indicating the assumption was not violated.  Figure 15  Acceptance Concerns Residual Scatterplot  44  Notes. The scores were centered along the zero point. There was no clear systematic pattern of the residuals for the acceptance concerns subscale scores that deviated from the rectangle formation. The image was not curvilinear, indicating the assumption was not violated. Multivariate Normality Assumption  Residuals should be normally distributed about the predicted measured variable scores.  The normal Q-Q plot should indicate that points lie in a straight line. This would indicate no major deviations from the normality assumption. Figure 16  Linear Regression Q-Q Plot Research Question One  Note. The figure depicted a reasonably straight diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right, indicating no major deviations from the normality assumption.  Normality for Research Question One  The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality tends to be used in studies with n > 50. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was not significant, p = .393, indicating no violation. 45  Outlier Assumption  The standardized residual values were > 3.3 and < â3.3. Cookâs distance maximum values were not > 1. The maximum value of Cookâs distance was < 1 (.13). This was acceptable and indicated no significant influences by outlier scores. Multiple Linear Regression Model for Research Question One  The assumptions for linear regression with the dataset were met, and further analysis for multiple linear regression was assessed. Multiple linear regression was used to determine whether concealment motivation and acceptance concerns could serve as a predictor of workplace satisfaction. Research Question One  Does workplace discrimination still occur for LGB individuals? How do microaggressions impact oneâs satisfaction with their employer? Do acceptance concerns and concealment motivation impact workplace satisfaction? Null Hypothesis  Concealment motivation and acceptance concerns cannot predict workplace microaggression experiences more than chance alone. Alternative Hypothesis  Concealment motivation and acceptance concerns can predict workplace microaggression experiences. Model Summary  The multiple regression model with the predictors concealment motivation and acceptance concerns produced RÂ² = .19, F(2, 85) = 9.97, p < .001. This determined that the model was a good fit and statistically significant. The model also accounted for 19% of the 46  variance for the MEWS scores. The null hypothesis indicated concealment motivation and acceptance concerns could not predict workplace microaggression experiences more than chance alone. The null hypothesis was rejected. The alternative hypothesis was supported, as the model was statistically significant, p < .001, indicating concealment motivation and acceptance concerns could serve as predictors for an increase in microaggression experiences at work. As shown in Table 2b, the model had significant positive beta weights, indicating participants with higher scores on concealment motivation and acceptance concerns were expected to have higher scores with the MEWS. Although concealment motivation (Î² = .24, p = .034) served as a predictor with higher MEWS scores, the analysis indicated that acceptance concerns (Î² = .49, p < .001) was a stronger predictor for the MEWS scores based on the model.  Table 2a  Model Fit Measures for Research Question One  Model R RÂ² F (2,85) p 1 0.44 0.19 9.97 .00013 Notes. The overall model is statistically significant, p < .01. The model accounted for 19% of the variance for MEWS scores.

The multilinear regression model indicated that both predictors were significant. However, acceptance concerns was a stronger predictor than concealment motivation. CI = confidence interval; LL = lower limit; UL = upper limit, p < .05 47  Research Question Two  The first research question investigated whether concealment motivation or acceptance concerns predicted microaggression experiences at work for LGB individuals. The second research question investigated if concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and microaggression experiences predicted relationship dissatisfaction in same-sex couples. Specifically, does concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, or workplace microaggressions impact relationship satisfaction? Are individuals less revealing of their identity, or are those in unsupportive work environments experiencing differences in relationship satisfaction? Null Hypothesis  Concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, or microaggression experiences at work cannot predict relationship satisfaction more than chance alone. Alternative Hypothesis  Concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, or microaggression experiences at work can predict relationship satisfaction. Sample for Research Question Two  Research question two was interpreted with caution due to being underpowered by sample size. Specifically, the sample size assumption indicates N > 50 + 8m would suggest that the sample size would need to be greater than 74 participants. The sample size was smaller than 74 participants. According to G*Power statistical software, the sample size was underpowered. This increased our chance of type I error. Post-hoc analysis indicated to achieve a power of .80 and a medium effect size, the required sample size should be 77 participants. 48  Sample Demographic for Research Question Two  One hundred sixteen participants began the survey; however, 66 individuals met the inclusion criteria for the studyâs second research question regarding relationship satisfaction. However, only 62 participants fully completed the survey. The sample consisted of 47 cisgender males and 15 cisgender females. The ages ranged from 18 to 68. More than half of the sample identified as White; however, there were other ethnic identities within the sample, as shown in Table 10. Most participants identified as employed and had a college education of a bachelorâs degree or above, as indicated in Table 3. Most participants identified as gay; however, there were other sexual orientation identities, as depicted in Table 10. To meet the criteria for the second research question, participants had to be in a relationship during their employment in the past year. Most participants identified as being in a relationship (87.10%), 8.10% were single, and 4.80% identified their relationship situation as complicated. The time in the relationship ranged from less than 6 months to 26 years, and the mean was 6.80 years. 49  Table 3  Research Question Two Demographics  Ethnicity n % White/Caucasian 41 66.10 Latino/Latinx 9 14.50 Black 2 3.20 Asian/Pacific Islander 3 4.80 Biracial: White/Latinx 1 1.60 Biracial: White/Native American 1 1.60 Multiracial: Asian/White/Latinx 2 3.20 Biracial: Asian/White 1 1.60 Afro Caribbean 1 1.60 Multiracial: Black/White/Native American 1 1.60 Sexual orientation   Gay 43 69.40 Bisexual 7 11.00 Lesbian 5 8.10 Bisexual and pansexual 4 6.50 Lesbian and gay 1 1.60 Asexual homoromantic 1 1.60 Pansexual 1 1.60 Degree   High school diploma 6 6.80 Vocational certification 5 5.70 Some college 10 11.40 Bachelors 35 39.80 Masters 25 28.40 Professional degree 7 8.00   Participants Who Did Not Meet Criteria  As mentioned previously, four participants met the inclusion criteria; however, those individuals did not answer all items for the measures used in the study. An accurate total score could not be acquired from the missing items for each measure, and those 4 participants were not included in the final sample size of 62 participants. There was no pattern for participants who left items unanswered. Two participants did not answer an item on the MEWS that pertained to coworkers assuming they were heterosexual. One participant did not answer an item on the 50  GLRSS regarding sharing with a family decision to adopt. Another participant did not have an item selected in the LGBIS regarding relationship privacy. There was no clear demographic pattern for participants who chose not to answer items. Two participants identified as White gay males; one participant identified as White, female, and bisexual; and one participant identified as White, female, and lesbian/gay. Assumptions for Research Question Two  Prior to statistical analysis and assessing model fit, assumptions were verified.  The Level of Measurement Assumptions  The predictorsâ concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and MEWS total score were all continuous interval scales. The GLRSS measured variable was also a continuous interval scale. Related Pairs Assumption  Each item answered for the concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and MEWS total score corresponded with a score on the GLRSS dependent variable. Several individuals did not answer all measurement items; however, those individuals were excluded from the study. The assumption for related pairs was met.  Independence of Observation Assumption  The measure was advertised through a Facebook post containing a SurveyMonkey link.  Participants answered items anonymously, and items were responded to privately. This alleviated influence or bias from other respondents. This assumption was met. 51  Assumptions for Concealment Motivation  Normality Assumption for Concealment Motivation  The skewness was 0.35, and the z score was 1.14, which falls between â1.96 and 1.96. This indicates there was not a violation of skewness. Kurtosis was â1.07, and the z score was â1.79, which did not indicate a violation of kurtosis. However, the Shapiro-Wilk test was significant, as Shapiro-Wilk p = .002. This was a violation. Figure 17  Concealment Motivation Histogram Research Question Two   Notes. The figure did appear to have a slightly positive skew. This could indicate a possible overestimation of lower subscale scores for concealment motivation. 52  Figure 18  Concealment Motivation Normal Q-Q Plot   Notes. The figure displays a fairly straight line with a slight curve. The lower-end and high-end values veered slightly away from the expected value line. This did not indicate a violation. Summary for Normality Assumption for Concealment Motivation  Two areas did not meet the assumption of normality, significance with the Shapiro-Wilk test and the histogram did not have a fair distribution of scores. However, other areas that met the assumption of normality were skewness, kurtosis, and the normal Q-Q plot, which formed a fairly straight line. Linearity Assumptions  The relationships between two variables should be linear. 53  Figure 19  Linear Relationships Scatter Plot  Notes. Figure 19 indicates a linear, negative relationship between concealment motivation subscale scores and the GLRSS scores. There appeared to be a straight line and not a curve. Scores concentrated on the upper center, and the relationship was negative.  Homoscedasticity Assumption  The variability of scores for the concealment motivation predictor was similar to that for the GLRSS dependent variable. Figure 19 also indicates a pattern appearing to form a rectangular shape, and there were no major deviations. The assumption was met. Outliers  There did not appear to be major influence or deviations by outlier scores. 54  Figure 20  Concealment Motivation Box Plot Research Question Two  Notes. The figure reveals a few outliers for the concealment motivation predictor variable. The two outlier scores were in the lower score range. Acceptance Concerns Assumptions  Normality Assumptions for Acceptance Concerns  There did not appear to be skewness for acceptance concerns. Skewness was 0.16, and the z score was 0.51. The z score fell between â1.96 and 1.96. There did not appear to be a violation of skewness. The kurtosis was â1.04, and the z score was â1.74, indicating no violation of kurtosis. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was significant, indicating no violation. Shapiro- Wilk p = .030. 55  Figure 23  Acceptance Concerns Histogram   Notes. The figure did not appear to be skewed and appeared fairly symmetrical for acceptance concerns subscale scores. The assumption was not violated. 56  Figure 24  Acceptance Concerns Normal Q-Q Plot Research Question Two   Notes. The normal Q-Q plot in Figure 24 roughly formed a straight line. The observed values lined up closer to the expected values. There was no violation.  Summary of Normality Assumption for Acceptance Concerns  The normality assumption was met. Although there was one violation of normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test, all other areas met the assumption of normality, which were skewness, kurtosis, distribution based on histogram images, and the normal Q-Q plot having values that closely lined up with the expected values. Linearity Assumption  The relationships between two variables should be linear and not form a curve. 57  Figure 25  Linear Relationship Scatter Plot  Notes. The figure indicates a negative relationship where lower scores on the acceptance concerns subscale corresponded to higher scores on the GLRSS. Scores appeared to form roughly a straight line and did not form a curve. The linearity assumption was met.  Homoscedasticity Assumption  According to Figure 25, the patterns appeared to form a rectangular shape, and there did not appear to be major deviations. The relationship of the acceptance concerns with the GLRSS appeared to form a pattern and negative direction. There was not a triangular pattern in Figure 25. The homoscedasticity assumption was met.  Outliers  There did not appear to be major influence or deviations by outlier scores. 58  Figure 26  Acceptance Concerns Box Plot Research Question Two   Note. Most scores were concentrated toward the rectangular area; however, there appeared to be two outliersâone on the high end and one on the low end, as depicted in the figure. Assumptions for the MEWS  Normality Assumption for the MEWS  The skewness was 1.07, and the z score was 3.52. This indicated there was a violation of skewness. Kurtosis was 0.60, and the z score was 1.01, which did not indicate a violation. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was significant, indicating a violation, Shapiro-Wilk p < .001. 59  Figure 27  MEWS Scores Histogram    Notes. The image of the histogram was positively skewed for the MEWS total score. The distribution was not evenly spread, which was a violation. This indicated an overestimation for the MEWS scores.  Figure 28  MEWS Scores Normal Q-Q Plot   Note. The observed values start trending as a straight line, and a slight deviation starts to occur at higher values, as shown in Figure 28. 60  Summary of Normality Assumption for MEWS  The image of the histogram and skewness violated normality, indicating that there was not a fair distribution. There was also a violation of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. However, there was no violation of kurtosis or the normal Q-Q plot. The assumption of normality was not met. Linearity Assumption  The relationships between two variables should be linear and not form a curve.  Figure 29  Linear Relationship Scatter Plot  Notes. There was a negative linear relationship between the independent variable, MEWS total score, and the GLRSS, as shown in the figure. The linearity assumption was met. Homoscedasticity Assumption  Patterns generally appear to form a rectangular shape, and the image appeared to be curvilinear. There was not a triangular pattern in Figure 29. The assumption was met. 61  Outliers  There did not appear to be major influence and deviations by outlier scores  Figure 30  MEWS Scores Box Plots  Note. There were three outliers for the MEWS total score on the low end and five outliers on the high end, as indicated in Figure 30. Assumptions for the GLRSS  Normality Assumptions for the GLRSS  There did not appear to be skewness for GLRSS. Skewness was â0.42, and the z score was â1.39. The z score fell between â1.96 and 1.96, which did not appear to violate skewness. According to Table 19, the kurtosis was 0.11, and the z score was 1.79, which did not indicate a violation of kurtosis. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality indicated there was no violation of normality as Shapiro-Wilk p = 3.13. 62  Figure 31  GLRSS Histogram   Notes. The image of the histogram appeared to be fairly symmetrical for the GLRSS total score. There was a slight negative skew. This indicated no violation. Figure 32  GLRSS Normal Q-Q Plot   Note. According to the image, the observed scores closely aligned with the expected value. 63  Normality Assumption Summary for GLRSS  The assumption of normality was met for the GLRSS. There was no violation of skewness, kurtosis, and the Shapiro-Wilk test. The images of the normal Q-Q plot and histogram did not have major deviations. The Linearity Assumption  The relationships between two variables should be linear and not form a curve.  Figure 34  Linear Relationships Scatter Plot  Notes. There did not appear to be a pattern that deviated from a rectangular formation for concealment motivation subscale scores, as depicted in the figure. The image did not appear to be curvilinear, and the normality assumption was met. 64  Figure 35  Linear Relationship Scatter Plot   Notes. There did not appear to be a pattern that deviated from a rectangular formation with acceptance concerns subscale scores, as depicted in the figure. The image did not appear curvilinear, and the normality assumption was met. 65  Figure 36  Linear Relationship Scatter Plot   Notes. There appeared to be a pattern. Scores were concentrated, with lower scores on the MEWS predictor corresponding to higher scores on the GLRSS. The image did not appear to be curvilinear, and the normality assumption was met.  Homoscedasticity Assumption  The patterns for the images appeared to form a rectangular shape, and there did not appear to be major deviations. There was no triangular pattern in Figures 34-36, however, the images depicted a negative direction with the predictor variables and GLRSS dependent variable. The homoscedasticity assumption was met. Outliers  There did not appear to be major influence or deviations by outlier scores. 66  Figure 37  GLRSS Box Plot  Note. There were two outliers for the GLRSS total score on the low end and one outlier on the high end.  Linear Regression Assumptions for Research Question Two  Sample Size Assumption  The methodology determined the sample size, N > 50 + 8m, from Tabachnick and Fidell (2013). The sample size required was a minimum of 74 participants. However, only 62 participants met the inclusion criteria and completed the surveys for the second research question. This assumption was unmet, and further analysis must be interpreted with caution. Linearity: Multicollinearity Assumption  According to Pearsonâs r, the correlation for concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and MEWS total score were in the acceptable range not exceeding a correlation of 0.7 as indicated in Table 4. This suggests that multicollinearity was not present. The tolerance value in Table 5 was > .10, indicating there was not a high degree of correlation with the predictor 67  variables. This also suggested that multicollinearity was not present. The relationship between concealment motivation and acceptances concerns was within the acceptable range. Linearity: Singularity  There was not a presence of singularity, as the predictor variables were not perfectly correlated with one another. The relationship of the variables was < 1 and > â1 as Pearsonâs r = .03 to .48 as indicated in Table 4. The VIF for concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and MEWS total score are as shown in Table 5. There was not a high degree of variance among the predictor variables. Table 4  Correlation Matrix for Research Question Two   Concealment Acceptance MEWS GLRSS Concealment Acceptance Pearsonâs r Pearsonâs r â 0.48 ***  â   MEWS Pearsonâs r 0.03 0.32 * â  GLRSS Pearsonâs r â0.36 ** â0.46 *** â0.29 * â Notes. The correlations among the predictor variables concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and MEWS total score were within the acceptable range. The correlations did not exceed 0.7. This suggested that multicollinearity was not present. The relationship of the variables was < 1 and > â1 as Pearsonâs r ranged from .03 to .48. * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p <.001.  Table 5  Collinearity Statistics   VIF Tolerance Concealment motivation 1.33 .76 Acceptance concerns 1.48 .68 MEWS total score 1.14 .88 Notes. The tolerance value was greater than .10 for each of the predictor variables. Scores indicated there was not a high degree of correlation with the independent variables. The tolerance did not indicate the presence of multicollinearity. The VIF values were not above 10, indicating there was not a high degree of variance among the independent variables. 68  This indicated there was not presence of multicollinearity. The relationship of the variables was less than 1.0 and greater than â1.0, as shown in Table 5. There was not presence of singularity, as the independent variables were not perfectly correlated with one another. Homoscedasticity Assumption  The variance of the residuals about predicted dependent variable scores should be the same for all predicted scores. The residual scatter plots indicated a substantial difference between obtained and predicted dependent variable scores. According to the standardized residual scatterplots, there was no clear or systematic pattern of the residuals, which deviated from the rectangle formation as shown in Figures 38 to 41. Figure 38  Fitted Standardized Residuals Scatterplot Research Question Two   Notes. The fitted standardized residual scatterplots were a rectangular formation and did not form a systematic pattern of the residual. The assumption was not violated. 69  Figure 39  Residual Scatterplot Concealment Motivation    Notes. The standardized residual scatterplots were a rectangular formation for concealment motivation subscale scores and did not form a systematic pattern of the residual. The image was not curvilinear, indicating the assumption was not violated. 70  Figure 40  Residual Scatterplot Acceptance Concerns    Notes. The standardized residual scatterplots were a rectangular formation for acceptance concerns subscale scores and did not form a systematic pattern of the residual. The image was not curvilinear, indicating the assumption was not violated. 71  Figure 41  Residual Scatterplot MEWS Total   Notes. The standardized residual scatterplots were a rectangular formation and did not form a systematic pattern of the residual. The image showed a concentration of scores in the lower range of the MEWS total score. The image was not curvilinear, which indicates the assumption was not violated  Multivariate Normality Assumption  Residuals should be normally distributed about the predicted measured variable scores. According to the normal Q-Q plot in Figure 42, the points lie on a reasonably straight diagonal line from bottom left to top right. 72  Figure 42  Linear Regression Normal Q-Q Plot Research Question Two    Note. The figure indicates that the GLRSS residuals formed a diagonal line, indicating there was no major deviation from the normality assumption.  Tests for Multivariate Normality Research Question Two  The Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of normality were consistent in not violating assumptions of normality, as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov was not significant p = .930. The multivariate assumptions of normality were met according to the image of the residual scatterplots forming a straight line and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Outlier Assumption  The standardized residual values should not be > 3.3 or > â3.3. Cookâs distance maximum values were not > 1. Cookâs distance takes into account substantial outliers and high leverage. High leverage is the observation differences and their distance from the regression line. The maximum value of Cookâs distance was 0.22, which is < 1. This was acceptable and indicated there were no significant influences by outlier scores. 73  Multilinear Regression Model for Research Question Two  Most of the assumptions for linear regression with the dataset for the second research question were met. The multivariate assumption of normality was met, there was no influence by outliers, and the normal Q-Q plot lined up closely with the expected values. However, the effective sample size assumption was not met. Although further analysis for multiple linear regression was assessed, the results were carefully interpreted with caution. Research Question Two Revisited  Do concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and workplace microaggressions impact relationship satisfaction? Are individuals less revealing of their identity, or are those in unsupportive work environments experiencing differences in relationship satisfaction? A multiple linear regression was used to determine if concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and MEWS total score could predict relationship satisfaction. Null Hypothesis  Concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and microaggression experiences at work did not predict relationship satisfaction more than chance alone. Alternative Hypothesis  Concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and microaggression experiences at work served as a predictor of relationship satisfaction. Model Summary for Research Question Two  The multiple regression model with the predictors concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, MEWS total score produced RÂ² = .27, F(3, 58) = 7.04, p < .001. This determined that the model was a good fit and statistically significant. The model accounted for 27% of the variance for the GLRSS scores. The null hypothesis indicated that concealment motivation, 74  acceptance concerns, and MEWS total score could not predict relationship satisfaction more than chance alone. The null hypothesis was rejected as the model was statistically significant, p < .001. The alternative hypothesis was supported, as it indicated that concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and MEWS total score can serve as predictors for the relationship satisfaction score. As shown in Table 6b, the acceptance concerns predictor (Î² = â.29, p = .037) had significant negative regression weights, indicating participants with lower scores on acceptance concerns were expected to have higher GLRSS scores. The other predictors, concealment motivation and MEWS total score, did not appear to contribute significantly to the multiple regression model. Table 6a  Overall Model Test Research Question Two  Model R RÂ² F ratio (3,58) p 1 0.52 0.27 7.04 .0004 Notes. The overall model was statistically significant, p < .01.

CI = confidence interval; LL = lower limit; UL = upper limit, p < .05. Acceptance = acceptance concerns, concealment = concealment motivation. 75  CHAPTER V: DISCUSSION  Results Summary  A multiple linear regression analysis took place to answer two research questions. The first research question investigated whether the degree of LGB identity disclosure could predict LGB microaggression experiences at work. Specifically, the LGB identity disclosure areas were concealment motivation and acceptance concerns, with the MEWS as the dependent variable. An increase in concealment motivation and acceptance concerns impacted the increase of MEWS scores. Acceptance concerns were a stronger predictor than concealment motivation in predicting LGB workplace microaggression experiences. The second research question explored if LGB identity disclosure or LGB microaggression experiences at work impacted same-sex partner relationship satisfaction. The results indicated that combining concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and LGB microaggression experiences can impact relationship satisfaction. However, only one variable, acceptance concerns, was significant. Lower scores in acceptance concerns could predict an increase in relationship satisfaction. The results were interpreted with caution due to being underpowered. There was a limited number of participants for the second research question. Acceptance concerns were the only predictor that impacted the GLRSS score. The other predictors alone did not contribute significantly to the linear regression model. A lower score on acceptance concerns predicted a higher GLRSS score. Research Question One Findings  The first research question investigated identity disclosure in the form of concealment motivation and acceptance concerns and the impact those had on workplace satisfaction and microaggression experiences at work. A multiple linear regression model indicated that concealment motivation, and acceptance concerns, served as a predictor for LGB MEWS scores. 76  Higher scores on concealment motivation indicated that individuals were more likely to be private about their identity. Concealment Motivation  Participants, on average, endorsed being in the moderate range for the concealment motivation subscale. Other studies that have used the LGBIS indicated that concealment motivation typically fell in the midpoint (moderate) range in nonclinical and college population samples. However, in clinical samples and the military population, scores were at the higher end of the midpoint range (Cramer et al., 2022). Participants in this study did acknowledge concealment motivation to a moderate degree. This scoring range suggests they could experience a need to conceal their LGB identity. The need for privacy could serve as a protective motivator. The nondisclosure of LGB identity was also seen as a motivator, according to a study involving gay police officers who found being out led to difficulty moving ahead in their careers (Collins & Rocco, 2015). The act of concealment can be more prone to less accepting work environments. Individuals with stigmatized identities in work settings could experience barriers to advancement, being stereotyped, and risk possible job loss (Clair et al., 2005). Microaggression experiences at work indicate less identity approval in workspaces, resulting in the need to conceal identity. Less concealment of identity could perpetuate microaggression experiences. Acceptance Concerns  Participants, on average, endorsed being in the moderate range for the acceptance concerns subscale. Higher scores on acceptance concerns could also indicate that individuals were more likely to be concerned about how others would perceive them about their identity. A component of acceptance concerns relates to perceived public affirmation. Participants denied 77  feeling entirely accepted, as scores indicated that participants, on average, endorsed a moderate level of acceptance concerns. Although the LGBIS measure may not fully answer why someone experiences acceptance concerns, it serves as a self-reported indicator. There could be personal, societal, and workplace experiences that lead to the perception of not being accepted. Other studies that have used the acceptance concerns subscale also found that scores were in the midpoint range for acceptance. However, a study with a clinical and military population found that scores were slightly above the midpoint, which showed an association with anxiety and acceptance concerns (Cramer et al., 2022). Other scholars have also indicated how environmental work factors led to acceptance concerns. One study found how perceived discrimination and perceived risks of discrimination can influence whether lesbian and gay workers decide to disclose their identity at work (Thuillier et al., 2021). Institutions may undermine oneâs work identity for those who identify as a sexual minority, which could impact participation in formal and informal activities (Resnick & Galupo, 2017). The undermining of identity could also lead to factors such as the need to feel accepted to avoid possible alienation. One study found that federal LGBT employees had perceptions of fewer opportunities to advance, felt less empowered, and were dissatisfied with peer relationships at work (Lewis & Pitts, 2017). Victims of discrimination could feel hesitant to report discrimination due to possible concerns of further mistreatment from other workers. Essentially, there is a need to feel accepted to prevent discrimination experiences. Acceptance concerns scores in the moderate range were still able to yield an effect with reported microaggression experiences. 78  Microaggressions  Most participants in this study endorsed scale items indicating they had encountered workplace microaggression experiences. Participants reported mild to moderate microaggression experiences at work based on LGB identity. The mild to moderate range could be due to factors such as the workspace becoming progressive or inclusive of LGB employees. Some studies found that progress and acceptance of outness varied in context. Specifically, a study found differences in outness among military service members in sectors such as their unit leaders, friends, medical professionals, and chaplain. Service members were likelier to be out in spaces such as with friends and medical professionals. However, within their working unit, there were differences. The study found that those with higher education, bachelorâs degrees and above, and higher rank officer status were less likely to be out to unit leaders (McNamara et al., 2021). The progress with outness and acceptance may have progressed in some spaces; however, the workspace is an area that continues to move slower. However, another factor to consider is whether individuals consider microaggressions as a form of discrimination. Participants in this study answered a demographic questionnaire before answering items from the measures. Most participants denied encountering workplace discrimination; however, scores indicated a mild to moderate degree of discrimination experiences. Participants may be unaware that microaggression experiences are acts of discrimination. Microaggressions can be challenging to report due to their varying degree of complexity. Some scholars have explored the complexities of reporting defensive interactions challenging identity in everyday encounters. Specifically, scholars have indicated how difficult it can be to describe specific invalidating exchanges, and instead, gathering themes retrospectively helped describe 79  prejudicial experiences (Wilkes & Speer, 2021). There are other reasons why microaggressions are challenging to report. Other scholars indicate that perpetrators are sometimes unaware of their microaggressions. Those experiences have been described as invisible by both the perpetrator and the recipient. The vagueness of microaggression experiences can make those experiences challenging to process in comparison to overt acts of discrimination (Sue et al., 2007). Supportive and Unsupportive Work Environments  A factor to consider is the amount of support in the workplace, which can also influence discriminatory experiences. Studies have indicated that employees believe that the organization cares about them when an organizationâs diversity climate perceptions are high compared to low (Stewart et al., 2011). An association found that more LGBT support at work was associated with less discrimination. However, hostile work environments were associated with high levels of workplace discrimination (Holman, 2019). Some work environments are not exclusively supportive or unsupportive toward LGB employees. Moderate views could lead to moderate discriminatory experiences. Implementing Workforce Diversity Training  The workforce could be seen as a representation of society regarding discrimination.  Studying work environments provides a range of age groups and other areas of diversity. Additional studies investigating microaggression experiences can help provide additional information in this less explored area. This area seems to be under-explored due to the assumption that society has progressed with LGB identity acceptance. Recent studies indicated that LGB individuals continue to experience high rates of discrimination, work stress, and mental health concerns related to those experiences (Moya & Moya-GarÃ³fano, 2020). The 2021 State 80  Equality Index indicates that protections for LGB employees have incrementally grown to 32 states (Warbelow et al., 2021). One factor that could facilitate growth would be establishing effective equality policies and training in the workplace. Workplace policies may need further implementation or clearer guidelines, which could help outline examples of microaggressions. Implementing diversity training on acceptance and understanding of LGB minorities could assist workspaces in demonstrating inclusivity and sensitivity. Scholars have indicated that organizations implement diversity training; however, they discussed the ineffectiveness of that training. The same scholars mentioned how increasing group contact among members from different groups could serve as another means to alleviate bias toward minority groups more so than diversity training alone (Dobbin & Kalev, 2018). Other scholars have investigated the differences between various formats in promoting social justice for LGBT individuals within a group context. Specifically, a study found that specific interventions in training that focused on lesbian and gay individuals were influential in positive social justice-related attitudes and behaviors. Interventions such as emphatic joy and antiheterosexism also indicated training effectiveness compared to generalized formats (Gonzalez et al., 2019). Other Considerations  The final four items in the MEWS pertained to cisnormative culture. The items could be debatable in their application to cisgender sexual minorities. One of the criteria to participate in this study was identifying as cisgender. However, some participants endorsed how those items still could apply to them. Research Question Two  The second focus of the study investigated concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and LGB microaggression experiences at work and the impact those have on a coupleâs 81  relationship satisfaction. A multiple linear regression model demonstrated a significant effect on concealment motivation, acceptance concerns, and microaggression experiences. The findings were interpreted with caution due to being underpowered. Results indicated that lower acceptance concerns with oneâs own LGB identity accounted for higher relationship satisfaction. Scores also indicated that participants, on average, were more likely to be experiencing relationship satisfaction with same-sex partners. Participants, on average, endorsed being in the moderate range for concealment motivation; however, concealment motivation did not substantially affect relationship satisfaction. Participants, on average, endorsed being in the moderate range for acceptance concerns. Relationship Support  Those who experience fewer concerns about needing to be accepted by others could feel more supported by their relationship. Perhaps being in a relationship could serve as a form of being accepted. One study that used the GLRSS found that being in a relationship predicted outness. In addition, the study also found that the length of time in a relationship predicted lower internalized stigma (Sommantico et al., 2018). Participants reported having low to moderate microaggression experiences at work based on LGB identity. As previously mentioned in a different chapter, work stress could spill over into home life. Studies have shown that people cannot completely detach from work stressors, affecting home life and relationship quality (Debrot et al., 2018). Job demands of hiding oneâs traits at work, such as sexual orientation, could lead to depleted resources that spill over into home life. The crossover occurs when stress and strain transmit to the partner (Williamson et al., 2017). However, the effects of microaggression experiences at work and relationship satisfaction did not substantially impact relationship satisfaction in this study. Although, acceptance concerns had a significant impact. 82  Future Considerations with Same-Sex Couplesâ Research  This studyâs relationship and social support findings contribute to same-sex couplesâ research. In same-sex couplesâ research, areas such as identity disclosure could be further explored. Feeling more accepted or the perception of feeling more accepted served as a predictor for relationship satisfaction. Few empirically based studies to date have investigated how to do work stressors such as discrimination crossover onto relationship life with same-sex partners. Previous chapters discussed how the crossover-spillover effect of work stress and relationship have been investigated with heterosexual couples. However, work stress was not explicitly explored in this study. Instead, discrimination in the form of microaggression of experiences could be seen as a work stressor. Therapeutic Considerations  Areas of identity disclosure can be further explored in the same coupleâs therapy. Feeling more accepted or the perception of feeling more accepted served as a predictor for relationship satisfaction. Acceptance concerns and social support can be an area that is further assessed in therapy. In recent studies, LGB identity affirmation and relationship satisfaction have been investigated. Such studies also found that identity acceptance is a predictor of relationship satisfaction in same-sex couples (Pepping et al., 2019). Strengths and Limitations  Strengths  Few studies have investigated LGB identity disclosure and workplace microaggressions in the last decade. Many political shifts can shape the views of LGB workers and their heterosexual coworker counterparts. Available studies to date have been case studies that investigated therapy with the LGB population and focused on personal factors associated with 83  identity, not external factors. Some studies have further examined how internal factors such as internalized homophobia affect external factors such as support. Internalized homophobia affected outness and autonomy support from others. Autonomy support included external factors such as coworkers and friends. The study found that greater outness was related to autonomy support, lower depression, and lower anxiety (Ryan et al., 2017). There have also been few studies that investigated identity disclosure and workplace microaggressions and how those areas could impact relationship satisfaction. This study contributed to the limited studies regarding relationship satisfaction and work. The sampleâs age appeared to be representative of the workforce, where participants identified as being in early-middle to middle-middle adulthood. This assisted with some of the generalizability of the results. Although the sample did primarily identify as gay, there was diversity in other sexual orientations identified. Research outside of lesbian, gay, and bisexual orientation is limited, and this study could help contribute information regarding other sexual minorities. Many participants identified as being more than one sexual orientation. Participants primarily identified as White; however, collectively, other ethnic/racial identities also made up the sample, which could help with some of the general representation of the population. Limitations  The second research question regarding relationship satisfaction was interpreted with caution due to being underpowered. Data collection occurred during various stages of the pandemic, where some people could have encountered a shift in working remotely and may have encountered fewer interactions with coworkers. The lack of exposure to coworkers during the earlier stages of the pandemic may have led to possible reduced encounters of microaggression experiences. Reduced interactions may have led to fewer identity disclosure and microaggression 84  experiences. Other factors that could have been considered were the shifts from working remotely to a hybrid format to working 100% again in person for some work sectors. The data had a low representation of women as most participants identified as male. Although there was diversity indicated, most of the sample identified as White. The sample may not have captured enough ethnic representation of the LGB workforce population. Transgender individuals were not included in the study and are part of the LGBT community. Perhaps, inclusion in future studies could also help with the general population representation. However, as previously mentioned, the transgender population should be studied independently due to additional societal oppression. Limitations with Procedures  There could be a reconsideration of the sample collection process. The study was advertised on Facebook, and participants were provided an option to share the advertised post of the study voluntarily. This could have possibly led to ethnic and gender bias in the sample. Suppose the study had been posted to other social media or an email distribution list. In that case, the sample size could have been larger and possibly incorporated more female-identifying participants. Future Directions  There appears to be growth in the number of states placing employment protections for LGB employees. This trend should be monitored through research to verify if there are changes in identity disclosure and microaggression experiences. Most of the sample identified as White; however, some participants had other ethnic identities. Possible differences between ethnic discrimination, LGB identity, and microaggressions in the workplace can be further explored. 85  The population from this study ranged from early-middle to late-middle adulthood.  Possible age and cohort differences with identity disclosure and microaggression experiences could be further explored. Specifically, each generation may have had unique struggles that could have impacted their coming out process. For instance, a stigmatized LGBT identity may have encountered different challenges for early-age adults in the 1970s compared to an early-age adults in the early 2000s. Further investigation could point out differences in acceptance and resiliency between cohorts. The age differences could also be further explored to examine potential differences in relationship satisfaction. Different cohorts may have encountered different experiences in sustaining long-term relationships. Since same-sex marriage was not legalized recognizable for some time, social support may have differed between cohort groups. The population from this study reported a mild to moderate degree of identity disclosure. Factors contributing to identity closure could be further investigated. As previously mentioned in earlier chapters, stigma can be both external and internal. Multiple factors could contribute to oneâs personal view of stigma. Exploring cultural views may shed more light on stigma views and differences with the disclosure process. Culturalism that can be explored in more detail is ethnicity, generation of citizenship, and region in the United States. A work culture that could be explored is the working class and professional class differences regarding outness and LGBT discrimination experiences. Understanding those differences could help in better understanding barriers to identity disclosure. Most of the sample identified as gay, and differences in microaggression experiences and relationship satisfaction among other identifying sexual orientations could be further explored. Specifically, there could be differences among those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, and those who identify as asexual. Although not investigated, a study with a similar design and focus can 86  investigate differences with outness, microaggression experiences, and relationship satisfaction among transgender individuals. Findings from this study and similar studies could provide supportive information to promote social justice. Specifically, legislatures could continue to address inequity in states that do not have protective practices, businesses could be conscious of less overt forms of discrimination, and companies could promote inclusivity of marginalized populations such as LGBT employees. 87  References  Allan, B.

    "abstract": "Progress has occurred in recent years for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender equal rights. However, there are still areas where discrimination is evident such as the workplace. Some lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender employees may not share their identity at work due to discrimination concerns. Such forms of discrimination may be passive acts such as microaggressions. These microaggressions can make work-life stressful; furthermore, the stress experienced at work may impact other areas such as home life. This study explored two areas. The first area investigated was whether identity disclosure at work affected workplace microaggressions. The sample size was 88 working adults who identified as cisgender and lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Participants completed an online survey posted through social media. The survey consisted of the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale and the Microaggressions Experiences at Work Scale. A multiple linear regression model assessed whether identity disclosure, specifically acceptance concerns and concealment motivation, could predict workplace microaggressions. Findings indicated the model was a good fit, and there was statistical significance for both acceptance concerns and concealment motivation as predictors for workplace microaggressions. However, acceptance concerns were the stronger predictor. The second area investigated relationship satisfaction with romantic partner. Sixty-two participants met the inclusion criteria, investigating whether acceptance concerns, concealment motivation, and workplace microaggressions could predict relationship satisfaction. The analysis was also multiple linear regression, and the model was determined to be a good fit. However, acceptance concerns were the only statistically significant predictor for relationship satisfaction. The findings provided insight on how lesbian, gay, bisexual identity disclosure and microaggressions spill into relationship life",
