Thus, these experienceshave been addressed as violations of intersex human rights. This research intends to explore intersexhuman rights across Europe and Latin America through a scoping review and legal research, includingthe review of activist documents. It seeks to study the experiences of violence suffered by intersexpeople, the role of states in promoting justice, and the possibilities offered by a human rightsframework to guarantee a dignified life for bodily diverse communities. This research also illustratesthat, although regional, cultural and social landscapes differ in both continents, intersex groups aresubject to constant violations of their human rights, and they struggle for recognition and for theirbodies to be respected outside the binary categories of sex and gender. Furthermore, European andLatin American states have made proven legislative advances that have led to the greater visibility ofintersex people but also face remaining difficulties and gaps.Keywords: intersex; human rights; children; Europe; Latin America1. IntroductionIntersexuality is a term that designates various conditions in which a person is bornwith diverse sex characteristics that differ from traditional definitions of male and female.According to Khanna (2021, p. 186), “to be intersex means that a person has genitals,reproductive organs, secondary sex characteristics, hormones and chromosomes that falloutside the commonly known binary definitions of either male or female sex”. Sinceintersex individuals have characteristics that do not fit into masculine and feminine roles,beliefs and practices, they suffer discrimination and stigmatisation from birth. Accordingto Human Rights Watch, intersex people are subjected to medical treatments that canpermanently harm them from infancy (Tamar-Mattis and Knight 2017). In general terms,violence against intersex individuals results from misinformation, stereotypes and mythscirculating about intersex. Subsequently, the trauma arising from these acts connectsintersex people’s conditions with human rights research and practice (Lev 2006).When addressing the violence committed against intersex people, it is essential todifferentiate the concepts of sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics todistinguish their fight for the respect of their rights from other population groups that mayhave also suffered discrimination within these terms. The Yogyakarta Principles (2007)refer to sexual orientation as “each person’s capacity for profound emotional, affectionaland sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a differentgender or the same gender or more than one gender” (p. 6). In addition, the same docu-ment conceives the concept of gender identity as “each person’s deeply felt internal andindividual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assignedat birth, including the personal sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen,modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) andother expressions of gender, including dress, speech and mannerisms” (The YogyakartaSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317. https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci11070317 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/socsciSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 2 of 18Principles 2007, p. 6). In contrast to these concepts, sexual characteristics can be regardedas “each person’s physical features relating to sex, including genitalia and other sexual andreproductive anatomy, chromosomes, hormones, and secondary physical features emergingfrom puberty” (YP+10 2017, p. 6). Intersex activists emphasise that, by subsuming thenotion of sex characteristics within the LGBT human rights framework, there is a riskof creating misconceptions around bodily diverse populations and neglecting importantissues that intersex people face, such as epistemic injustice (Carpenter 2015).In this sense, according to the United Nations “between 0.05% and 1.7% of the popula-tion is born with intersex traits” (UN 2017, p. 1), which means that they have variationsin their sex characteristics that do not fit the medical and social definitions of male andfemale. Hence, they are subject to discrimination and other human rights violations basedon the variation of their sexual characteristics (Ghattas 2019). According to a previous studyon the situation of intersex people in Europe, perfectly healthy intersex individuals havealso experienced prenatal interventions and medical interventions on their bodies (Monroet al. 2019, apud in Ghattas 2019). The documentation analysed indicates that the majorstruggles intersex people face are related to society’s perception of the variation of theirsex characteristics. Therefore, from an early age, intersex people are subjected to so-calledsex-normalising surgeries, which can be understood as irreversible procedures performedon intersex children to assign a sex that fits the gender role according to social expectations(Tamar-Mattis and Knight 2017). These “[i]nvasive, irreversible and non-emergency med-ical interventions” have resulted in traumatic experiences that intersex people undergofrom an early age (Ghattas 2019, p. 15).Existing research on human rights law and the human rights of intersex people inEurope and Latin America has addressed the role of the law in protecting the life ofbodily diverse people. Garland and Slokenberga (2018) have explored medical practices onintersex children to explain how, in Europe, these practices entail human rights violations,according to the guidelines of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the EuropeanUnion values. However, few European countries, including Malta, Portugal, Germany andIceland, have strictly prohibited medical procedures and treatments of intersex children.In Latin America, legal research frameworks have addressed the human rights of intersexpeople. For instance, Flores-Manzano and Vázquez-Martínez (2021) demonstrated how thehuman rights of intersex communities have been violated, stigmatised and made invisiblein Ecuador without present regulations having achieved greater inclusion. In Chile, thelegal problems associated with intersex status have also been investigated.Grez (2020) argued that the intersex human rights struggle extends to medical practiceand law borders. There remain social norms and beliefs that encourage discrimination andviolence toward intersex people, which is why protecting them against violations of theirhuman right to bodily integrity is urgent.Injustice against intersex people in Latin America and Europe calls for research as towhether human rights are enshrined in the legal provisions. A comparative investigationof these matters would also deepen the analysis of intersex people’s human rights on bothcontinents and would help us to better understand why such a framework is needed toimprove the lives of intersex people. This research explores the current human rightssituation of intersex people in Europe and Latin America through a scoping review and alegal research framework that includes the analysis of activist documents. Accordingly, itseeks to understand the general human rights provisions related to intersex people in thesecontinents by also reviewing intersex activist perspectives on these legal developments.Thus, it aims to understand how European and Latin American states have establishedmeasures to protect intersex people’s human rights at different levels. In addition, thisresearch interrogates the existing gaps between the parameters provided by internationallaw and their application in the national legislation. Both Europe and Latin America havedistinct trajectories of legal development, sociocultural contexts and activism for intersexhuman rights, and may, therefore, provide different approaches. While in Europe theresults of activism have encouraged legislation that promotes the protection of the rights ofSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 3 of 18intersex people (OII Europe 2022), in Latin America, the recognition of their problems hasbeen first acknowledged in the decisions of the courts, and these sentences have been usedaccordingly as tools to protect the rights of intersex people and advocate for a legislationthat guarantees their rights (Pikramenou 2019). The different legal dynamics of thesecontinents are the reason why they were chosen as cases of study for this research.This article is divided into four main sections. First, the methodological strategyto analyse the current human rights situation of intersex communities in Latin Americaand Europe will be described. Second, an analysis will be provided of the human rightsviolations based on gender expression/identity and sex characteristics. Subsequently, adiscussion will take place on the current status of intersex human rights in both regions.The final section will present the concluding remarks of the study.2. Materials and MethodsThis research is the result of a scoping review and legal research that includes publica-tions and reports of major intersex NGOs and institutions. In this section, the approachesto data collection and analysis are addressed.2.1. Scoping ReviewA scoping review was carried out to analyse the human rights situation of intersexpeople in Europe and Latin America. Scoping reviews have become a well-known techniquefor synthesising research evidence in epidemiology and synthesis studies, but also in thecontext of social sciences (Pham et al. 2014). According to Pham et al. (2014), the primarypurpose of this review modality is to identify available research evidence on a given topic.In this research, the scoping review was conducted to analyse the contemporary de-velopment of intersex human rights and their most common violations. Consequently,recent literature on the protection of the human rights of intersex individuals was identi-fied, examining their political demands and the legal and public policy gaps concerningtheir protection.The literature review was conducted between 2015 and 2021. To identify the correctcontent, “intersex” OR “DSD” OR “differences in sex development” OR “disorders of sexdevelopment” AND “human rights” were used as keywords. SCOPUS, Web of Science andPubMed databases with texts in English were the sources. In addition, Scielo, a databasewith a predominance of texts in Spanish and Portuguese, was chosen to provide morecoverage of the cultural environment, particularly for Latin America. Across the databasesmentioned, 165 articles were found. Subsequently, 21 duplicates were removed, leaving144 articles. Their titles and abstracts were analysed for relevance to the study topic. Afterthis process, 45 articles were selected for inclusion in the final analysis.2.2. Legal Research Approach and Review of Activist DocumentsAlthough this paper is based on the references found in the scoping review, it focusesmore thoroughly on the legal instruments for protecting the human rights of intersexpeople, since the purpose of the study was not only to explore the current situation ofintersex human rights in Europe and Latin America but also to examine their effectiveapplication. This research is based on the comparative analysis of the legal context ofintersex people’s human rights in Europe and Latin America.To better understand this approach, it is essential to explain the legal doctrine used.Van Hoecke described the legal doctrine as a set of specific actions such as interpretingtexts, creating arguments, providing empirical evidence for these arguments, creatingaxioms and logical suppositions, and assuming positionings (Van Hoecke 2011). In a strictsense, the legal doctrine is a normative and argumentative discipline because it deals withinterpreting texts and arguments (Van Hoecke 2011). Subsequently, the legal doctrine hasbeen defined as an empirical discipline because it presents research questions that leadto creating statements that are then tested through empirical data collection (Van Hoecke2011). Furthermore, since legal doctrine is a discipline that explains why norms are valid inSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 4 of 18each society, it provides explanations, axioms and logical statements (Van Hoecke 2011).Finally, the legal doctrine is a normative discipline because it describes the norms andsystematises them, assumes positions, and adopts values and interests (Van Hoecke 2011).According to Van Hoecke (2011), the different definitions of legal doctrine led to theadoption of plural methodologies to address the place of norms in a given society (VanHoecke 2011). As a result, numerous sources can be considered in methodologies to explorelegal doctrines. For instance, a researcher can incorporate law cases, scholarly writings andprimary sources to create and sustain arguments and normative positions (Van Hoecke2011). Hence, legal research is an approach that focuses on laws and regulations and thefunctioning of organisations and institutions in legal research society (Van Hoecke 2011).Leeuw and Hans (2016) also explained that legal research considers the consequences oflaws for individuals, organisations and social actors. Thus, the legal research approachassumed in this research included examining publications and reports of major intersexNGOs and institutions. Through the review of these documents, the way intersex activismevaluates the implementation of these laws and regulations in everyday life was analysed.2.3. Data Collection, Systematising and ReviewThe process of collecting, systematising and reviewing information comprehendsdifferent levels. First, the legal issue addressed in this research was described, which is theprotection of the human rights of intersex people. In that sense, numerous sources wereconsidered, such as jurisprudence of national and international courts, recommendations ofinternational organizations, statements and publications from intersex NGOs, with 43 legaldocuments and 27 publications of intersex NGOs reviewed. Additionally, attention waspaid to the institutions, and a distinction was made according to their international, regionalor national scope. The institutions analysed in this research were the United Nations, theEuropean Parliament, the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, andthe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Regarding the national legislations,the countries of Spain, Belgium, Germany, Iceland, Portugal, Malta, Colombia, Mexico,Argentina, Chile and Costa Rica were studied to establish legal comparisons. Finally, thisresearch collected experiences and data from declarations and reports made by the NGOsOII Europe, ILGA-Europe, Intersex Human Rights Australia–IHRA, Brujula Intersexual,STOPIGM, and other individual intersex activists.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Human Rights Violations Based on Gender Expression/Identity and Sex CharacteristicsTraditionally, the presence of differences within a diverse society, such as the contrast-ing ways of expressing one’s sex, gender identity or the diversity of bodies, has promoteddiscriminatory scenarios where a person becomes a subject of violence or marginalisationbecause of their bodily difference (UN 2001). Discussing these scenarios exposes the legalsystems’ difficulties in eradicating unequal treatment and discriminatory practices. Thescoping review and legal research, including the review of activist documents, explaineda number of essential advances in intersex human rights, elucidating experiences andmechanisms for their protection. It is essential to highlight how intersex organisationsassert that gender recognition is not enough to protect the right to the physical and mentalintegrity of intersex people (IHRA 2019). In addition, social movements have highlightedhow significant it is not to confuse sex and gender when considering intersex humanrights, which are mainly determined by sex characteristics and embodied experiences(IHRA 2019).These legal developments, debates and disputes can be interpreted in the context of theConvention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) (UN 1989) and the United Nations Conventionagainst Torture and Other Cruel and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment(UNCAT) (UN 1987) to elucidate the struggles against cruel medical procedures, self-recognition and identity, and the right to truth. There are differences in how these legaldocuments mention intersex human rights. On the one hand, the Yogyakarta PrinciplesSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 5 of 18plus 10 (YP+10 2017) explicitly address the human rights of intersex people. On the otherhand, the CRC (UN 1989) and the UNCAT (UN 1987) affirm the universal application ofhuman rights that can be used for intersex individuals.The Yogyakarta Principles (2007) were launched in 2007 by experts and activists fromdifferent fields to apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (UN 1948)in response to massive human rights abuses related to sexual orientation, gender expres-sion/identity and sex characteristics. The initial idea of this civil society manifestation wasto articulate universal values applicable to sexual orientation and gender identity and toclarify concepts to avoid discriminatory treatment (O’Flaherty 2015). Since its creation,this statement has achieved an international influence and positive impact; however, therewere issues that the first version did not explicitly cover, and, in 2017, additional principleswere developed to extend some topics. The guarantee of the protection of human rightsof intersex people was one of the main aims of the new approach. Thus, the YP+10 (2017)considers sex characteristics and relevant situations for intersex people.There are serious human rights violations associated with bodily perception. In conse-quence, the YP+10 (2017) includes crucial matters, such as the right to bodily and mentalintegrity, the right to legal gender recognition, and the right to truth. In addition, the YP+10(2017) proposes states’ obligations that are essential for the legal defence of intersex humanrights. The YP+10 Principle 32, which mandates the right to bodily and mental integrity,and its obligation “D” prescribe how intersex child protection must be developed:STATES SHALL: ( . . . )(D) Bearing in mind the child’s right to life, non-discrimination, the best interestsof the child, and respect for the child’s views, ensure that children are fully consultedand informed regarding any modifications to their sex characteristics necessary to avoidor remedy proven, serious physical harm, and ensure that any such modifications areconsented to by the child concerned in a manner consistent with the child’s evolvingcapacity. (YP+10 2017, p. 10)This obligation focuses on one of the main aspects of the defence of intersex humanrights, the agency of children and their best interest when performing medical proceduresat an early age (YP+10 2017). Carrying out medical interventions which are stronglyinfluenced by social stereotypes and not biological needs is a violation of the UDHR (UN1948). Article 3, which concerns the right to life, liberty, and security of the person, andArticle 5, linked to the prohibition of torture, punishments, or degrading treatments, canbe interpreted in relation to the protection of intersex children against abuse presentedby medical treatment (UN 1948). The same tenet is also established by Article 7 of theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (CCPR) (UN 1966), which prohibitstorture or degrading conduct against people, specifying that a human being cannot besubjected to experimentation without her/his/their free consent. In addition, the CRC(UN 1989), in its Article 24, determined that States Parties must implement all effectivemeasures to abolish traditional health practices, which also applies to the protection ofintersex children. Consequently, Article 37 prescribes that no child shall suffer any type ofdegrading treatment or punishment.Concerning the right to legal recognition, the YP+10 (2017), in its Principle 31 andobligation “B”, points out the state’s obligation to ensure modification of names, basedon the self-determination of the person: (B) Ensure access to a quick, transparent andaccessible mechanism to change names, including to gender-neutral names, based on theself-determination of the person. (YP+10 2017, p. 9)Administrative procedures linked to gender assignment at the moment of birth andthe desire to change this in the future should not be discriminatory and, whether or notthey actually are discriminatory, they should be considered a violation of the UDHR (UN1948). Article 6, which mentions that “everyone has the right to recognition everywhereas a person before the law”, represents this mandate. Moreover, Article 7 affirms thatall people are entitled to equal protection before the law without discrimination. In thesame vein, the CCPR (UN 1966) in Article 16 states that “everyone shall have the right toSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 6 of 18recognition everywhere as a person before the law”. Furthermore, the CRC (UN 1989) inArticle 7 recognises “the right to every child to acquire a nationality”. Moreover, Article 8clearly states that when a “child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his orher identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a viewto re-establishing speedily his or her identity”. Finally, the CRC completed the ruling withArticle 8, n. 2, which calls on the states to provide appropriate assistance and protectionto re-establish the rights of children when they are “illegally deprived of some or all theelements of their identity”. In this sense, these legal tools provide human rights-basedarguments for parents of intersex people who want to classify them at birth in a binarycategory or would like to wait until the intersex person decides to modify the categoryinitially assigned when they are older.The third important statement for intersex people in the YP+10 (2017) is Principle37, the right to truth, which contains an important state duty to intersex people in itsobligation “C”. The YP+10 (2017) directly mandates the protection of intersex people’srights to know the truth about their medical histories. The circumstances surroundinginvasive medical interventions related to the bodies of intersex people in the early stagesof life are accompanied by secrecy in the procedures, the prohibition of the parents fromtelling their children about the interventions performed, and the denial of access to medicalrecords (Horowicz 2017). Intersex people are denied the truth about the medical proceduresperformed on their bodies, and how these procedures can impact their body and identity,and this constitutes a violation of the right to autonomy, identity and personality.It is possible to appreciate that the legal framework for claiming the right to truth andprotecting intersex people against these violations is not as well developed as the right tobodily and mental integrity and its link with torture, or the legal recognition and its linkwith equal treatment before the law. However, the right to truth has been established underthe umbrella of transitional justice, understanding transitional justice as the process of asociety from conflict to peace after systematic human rights violations. In this context, theachievement of justice during the restructuring of society gives legitimacy to the new stateinstitutions (Sweeney 2018).There are intersex human rights violations related to medical procedures, self-recognitionand identity, and truth. The scoping review and the legal research framework with thereview of activist documents illustrated how the knowledge produced on the human rightsof intersex people represents a predominant interest in the first two legal matters. Theright of intersex communities to the truth has been tenuously addressed in legal researchbecause this issue has not been fully developed in international human rights law, either.Consequently, it is important to inquire about the collective struggle of intersex persons fortheir right to the truth, which includes complete knowledge about the medical proceduresperformed on their bodies.3.2. Current Human Rights Situation of Intersex People in Europe and Latin AmericaThe protection of intersex people’s human rights has been a matter of recognitionand awareness in Europe and Latin America, acquiring more visibility in the last decadethanks to intersex advocacy and activism efforts. Although there have been significantsteps toward constructing intersex human rights frameworks, there is still a gap betweenthe parameters provided by international law, which is not strictly enforceable, and theapplication of these in the national legislation.3.2.1. EuropeThe research included a review of resolutions, recommendations and reports of theEuropean Union institutions, as well as intersex-related legislation in some countries ofthe European continent were analysed. The European Union (EU) has an institutionalisedstructure distinguished by its strong representation in fields such as human rights protec-tion. Its legal framework is characterised by fundamental values that are not subject toexceptions, with a horizontal system for the protection of fundamental rights, which meansSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 7 of 18the prevalence of these rights must be considered by all internal bodies, regardless of thetopics they cover (European Parliament 2021). Moreover, there are specialised bodies thatdeal with the topics directly related to human rights protection: the Council of Europe(CoE), the European Parliament, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights(FRA) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).Over the past few years, EU bodies have issued resolutions and recommendationsfor its member states to stop the practice of sex-normalising surgeries on intersex children.In 2013, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) was the first toshow its concern for the physical integrity of intersex children regarding the performanceof cosmetic surgeries within the EU (PACE 2013). Years later, the FRA (2015) and theCommissioner of Human Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE 2015) issued reports onthe situation of intersex people and the need to protect their human rights in Europe.Furthermore, in a 2017 resolution, the PACE (2017) confirmed that these surgeries haveshown no “ . . . evidence to support the long-term success of such treatments, no immediatedanger to health and no genuine therapeutic purpose for the treatment” (p. 1). Followingthis idea, the European Parliament (2019) pointed out in resolution in 2019 the “urgent needto address violations of the human rights of intersex people, and calls on the Commissionand the Member States to propose legislation to address these issues” (p. 4).European laws and courts’ rulings are not only tools to interpret legal principles butalso a means to struggle for intersex rights. Some of these legal documents directly mentionintersex people, while others assume that the rights of bodily diverse communities areof direct application in the human rights field. Regarding torture, the European Courtof Human Rights (EctHR) has extended the scope to consider the applicability of theEuropean Convention of Human Rights, Article 3, when (i) the treatment performed isinhuman and degrading, which includes not only physical but also mental suffering (CoE2021), and (ii) such treatment reaches a deep level of psychological anguish.1 In addition tothese requirements, the intensifying criterion to classify the actions under Article 3 is “thesuspicion that it is committed under the inevitable context of discrimination based on sex,age, race, ethnic origin and religion”2 or that it is committed “particularly to children andother vulnerable members of society”, which requires reinforced protection as a positiveobligation of Article 3.3 Furthermore, concerning the case of medical interventions, theECHR has emphasised that the procedures that violate physical integrity must have a solidjustification for creating such an amount of suffering.4 Moreover, the states have a positiveobligation to prevent the commission of ill-treatment and investigate the possible violationof human rights that covers itself with the redress of the damage, according to Article 13 ofthe Convention.5As reported in the Council of Europe’s issue paper, for intersex children, the med-ical procedures performed, which begin at birth and in childhood, and later hormonaltreatments in adolescence and adulthood may lead to lifelong physical and mental con-sequences (CoE 2015). In addition, the intensity of an unnecessary clinical interventioncan cause bodily humiliation, great pain and traumatisation; thus, the report describeshow medical diagnoses given to an intersex child become a reason to transform their bodywithout their consent and provoke unnecessary suffering. Thus, the Council of Europe(CoE 2015) expressed disapproval of these corrective surgeries and stated the need for thelegal prohibition of these practices.Establishment of positive obligations regarding these practices has been achievedby some European countries that have become leaders in the protection of the humanrights of intersex people. Malta, Portugal, Iceland and Germany have achieved greaterprotection of the fundamental rights of intersex people, particularly children, who are themost vulnerable to unnecessary medical interventions during the first stages of their lives.Meanwhile, Belgium and Spain are currently in the legal process of creating their nationalregulations regarding intersex human rights.Malta was the first country to recognise and protect the rights of a person based on theirsex characteristics. Its government enacted in 2015 a law called the Gender Identity, GenderSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 8 of 18Expression and Sex Characteristics Act,6 which, besides ensuring the self-determinationand expression of gender identity for Maltese citizens, condemns any medical treatmentor intervention performed to adjust children’s sex characteristics without their informedconsent. Furthermore, the law contemplates the parents’ consent as a replacement onlyunder exceptional circumstances and the support of an interdisciplinary team elected bythe government to ensure the child’s best interests.7 According to intersex activism, this lawis vital because it protects the territory of sex characteristics and mandates caring for thechildren’s physical integrity (ILGA 2015). Additionally, the law forbids genital mutilation,which is one of the most disturbing concerns for intersex people.8Along the same lines, Portugal adopted a law in 2018 to regulate the same twoconcerns: the self-determination and expression of gender identity and the protection of thephysical integrity of an intersex person against modifying their sexual characteristics. ThisPortuguese law prohibits medical interventions on intersex people “until the moment thatis a manifestation of their gender identity” (Article 5) and as long as there is no “provenrisk” to the health of the intersex person.9Another notable legislative act is the one issued by the government of Iceland in201910 which focuses on gender recognition. The law regulates important aspects regardingintersex people’s rights in its Article 11a, according to which: (i) permanent changes “shallonly be made in conformity with the will of the child and its level of gender identity,and always with the best interests of the child in mind”; (ii) the duty of hospitals is toprovide “counselling and support” for the guardians and child; (iii) the possibility forthe guardians and child to “seek expert opinion outside the team on the necessity ofsuch treatment, free of charge” is required; and (iv) an important step for data collectionis the mandate that medical institutions “enter information on the treatment into thehealth record and provide the Director of Health with information on the number andnature of surgical operations and medication and the age of those who undergo thesechanges.” This law considers many crucial aspects for the protection of the rights of intersexpeople. Sadly, regarding the right to bodily integrity, there are some exceptions. The lawexcludes hypospadias and micropenis from these regulations, indicating that in thesecases the permanent changes “shall not be performed unless a detailed assessment ofpossible advantages and consequences in the short and long term has been undertaken,including the consequences of not performing a surgical operation or providing medicationor postponing it until the child can express its will.” This decision has been made even whenthere were reports documenting the serious human rights violations that these proceduresconstitute for intersex people (StopIGM 2020a).Because the laws from Malta, Portugal and Iceland address similar aims, their effec-tiveness can be compared. Intersex activists in Europe have pointed out that even thoughthese countries recognise the need to protect intersex people from these medical abuses,there are still extensive gaps in the current legislation (StopIGM 2019a). Regardless of thenorm, paediatric units of public and private hospitals still consider intersex traits as “ab-normalities”, and therefore, they openly acknowledge the need for a surgical “correction”,“reconstruction”, or “repair” of the minor’s body (StopIGM 2019a, p. 56; 2019b, p. 21).Thus, these three countries have established regulations prohibiting unnecessary med-ical interventions but they have not defined a clear legal consequence if those prohibitionsare carried out. If the treating doctor performs surgery without informed consent and thereis no imminent risk to the health of the child, the three countries’ laws fail to define thespecific type of sanction (administrative, civil, or criminal). If the norm prohibits specificconduct, their legal duty would be to establish the consequences for its non-compliance,but since there are no clear judicial measures, it is impossible to advance to a stage ofcompensation/reparation for the victims. This results in another serious legal gap inthe legislations.In the cases of Germany and Belgium, both countries recognised the right of intersexpeople to choose a non-binary or diverse option in the civil register. Regarding the Germancivil register, there are two regulations, one created in 2013 which prescribes that a child whoSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 9 of 18cannot be assigned to the male or female sex should be registered without any legal gender,and a later gender register could be added with a medical certificate that proves the binarysex.11 The second regulation in 2018 gave the option for intersex babies to be registered ina category named “divers”.12 Both regulations were criticised by intersex activists sincethey potentially increase the pressure for gender assignation and the stigmatisation ofa child with a medical diagnosis related to intersex traits (OII Europe 2013, 2018; ILGAEurope 2018). Additionally, the German Congress lately approved a law to ban unnecessarymedical procedures for intersex children until they can express their full and informedconsent or until it is approved by the Court.13 However, according to activists, someloopholes would allow these surgeries to be performed; if the intersex condition is notreported, doctors can implement any treatment of the person, and again, there is noconcrete legal consequence for violating the law (Haug 2021; Bundesverband 2021; OIIEurope 2021a).In Belgium, the situation is also recent. In 2021, the House of Representatives called onthe government through a resolution to legislate in the protection of the physical integrityof intersex children and ensure the prohibition of medical treatments without the informedand full consent of the intersex person.14 Currently, this bill is in progress, and intersexactivists have maintained the importance of this step in protecting the rights of intersexpeople, emphasising that further legislation is needed to comprehensively cover points thatthe resolution did not mention regarding harmful practices (OII Europe 2021b).Lastly, Spain constitutionally recognises the autonomy of its regions, which enjoy acertain level of independence in the administration of some of the national mandates,15thereby introducing a diverse range of rights protections. Hence, the legal status of medicalinterventions depend on the region where the intersex baby is born. For instance, if the birthtakes place in Madrid, Aragón, Murcia or the Canary Islands,16 the regional legislationsprotect the children and prohibit unnecessary medical procedures to the intersex person. If,on the contrary, the person is born in another region, the legal protection to safeguard therights to bodily integrity will depend on the legal advances that community has made instrengthening the protection of the human rights of intersex people. Thus, some intersexpeople in Spain have greater guarantees of legal protection of their rights, whereas othersmay encounter obstacles to obtaining legal recognition.Regarding national legislation, Spain does not have a law that directly protects intersexpeople’s human rights. However, a draft bill is in progress for the effective equality of transpeople and the guarantee of LGTBI rights.17 This draft bill has a depathologising approach,where the intersex person will have comprehensive healthcare, and forbids any genitalmodification practices in the newborn, except “in cases where medical indications requireotherwise to protect the health of the person”.18 Another aspect to highlight is the one-yearperiod that the government will give the parents of the intersex baby to register the sex inthe civil registry, in the light of this draft bill.19Aside from these three states, most European states lack harmonisation betweenthe decisions issued by European entities and their materialisation in national legislationregarding intersex people’s rights. Regardless of the strong recommendations made by theEuropean institutions, according to the FRA report published in 2015, “sex (re)assignmentor sex-related surgery seems to be performed on intersex children, and young people, in atleast 21 EU Member States” (FRA 2015, p. 6). This means that, despite of the deficiencyof evidence proving these so-called corrective procedures to be necessary, most countriescontinue to neglect the creation of legislation that prohibits non-consensual surgeries onsex characteristics.In France, according to the Periodic Report on the CCPR elaborated by the NGOsStopIGM and GISS/Alter Corpus, numerous forms of intersex genital mutilation continueto be practised, such as unnecessary medical procedures and cosmetic genital surgeries(StopIGM 2020b) through public institutions such as the Reference Centre for Rare Dis-eases.20 The national guidelines contemplate numerous treatments for intersex newbornsSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 10 of 18without medical necessity, interventions like “‘masculinising’ genital surgeries, ‘feminising’procedures, and sterilising procedures are carried out in public university clinics to intersexchildren where approximately 86% are under four years” (StopIGM 2020b, p. 20). Theseprocedures are justified as a means, for example, to “restore functional genital anatomy toallow future penetrative intercourse (as a male or a female)”, “avoid stigmatization relatedto atypical anatomy” and “respond to the parents’ desire to bring up a child in the bestpossible conditions” (StopIGM 2016, p. 10).This same line of action has been taken in other European countries, for example, inthe UK no specific rule bans intersex surgeries (Nelson 2018). Therefore, these surgeriescan generally be performed with valid legal consent. However, children and infants cannotgive informed consent, which means British law assumes the parents’ responsibility isto provide informed consent under the Children Act (Nelson 2018). In another ‘shadowreport’ prepared by the Intersex NGOs in the UK, it was argued that intersex genital surgerypractices are still widely practised in the UK (StopIGM 2019d). As in France, intersex childsurgeries are permitted through the public health system and facilitated by third parties(StopIGM 2019d). Although this country is committed to preventing surgeries and anycruel or degrading treatment against intersex people, medical procedures for bodily diversechildren are still being normalised to remove their “atypical” sex traits (Monro et al. 2017,p. 11). Hence, intersex people continue to be victims of serious human rights violationswith procedures such as “masculinising genital surgical procedures that are unnecessary forbasic functioning are routinely advocated and performed in NHS hospitals for hypospadias,for social rather than medical reasons” or “clitorectomies which are entirely unnecessaryfor medical reasons” (Monro et al. 2017, p. 11).Another important human rights violation observed in the research is the lack ofcompensation and recognition of the intersex victims for the mentioned practices. Forinstance, in Austria the absence of data collection and monitoring and the difficultiesintersex people have accessing their clinical records has created a hostile environment forthem to claim their rights in the court (StopIGM 2019e). The consequence of this is a cultureof impunity and difficulty of access to justice.The previous national situations made it possible to appreciate the diversity of legis-lation and current human rights protection in Europe. The scoping review and the legalresearch framework with the review of activist documents showed to what extent major vio-lations of human rights prevail in European laws, especially in terms of medical proceduresand gender recognition. In this regard, European countries’ realities are heterogeneous and,therefore, the degrees of recognition of the rights of intersex people are diverse. There arecountries with conservative cultures and restrictive gender recognition legislations that arereluctant to guarantee a dignified life for LGBTI communities and particularly for trans andintersex people, such as Hungary, Lithuania, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.On the contrary, there are countries that demonstrate greater inclusion in legislation, whichis evident in how intersex people have used the law to defend equality. This situation hasparticularly prevailed in Malta, Portugal, Germany, and Iceland, and it is in progress forBelgium and Spain. According to the results of this research, none of these countries hascompleted its development or public discussion of the right to truth as a guarantee of theachievement of social justice for the intersex community.3.2.2. Latin AmericaLatin America has a history of social movements claiming participatory actions re-flecting diversity and experiences that are mirrored in the exercise of rights (Dagnino2006). Hence, the countries of Latin America share a common past of violence in additionto cultural beliefs which promote sexual hierarchies and endonormativity practices thatlegitimise violence and punishment of people with sexual orientations, gender expres-sions/identities and sex characteristics that differ from the norm. Usually, this violence isnurtured by traditional conceptions of men’s and women’s roles in society. In this way,the protection of human rights and the creation of anti-discrimination laws for the LGBTISoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 11 of 18population in Latin America are invisible to state authorities, leaving the region with oneof the highest rates of violence against this population (SinViolenciaLGBTI 2019).The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR 2015) has defined theviolence in the Latin American region against the LGBTI population as a social phenomenoncalled bias violence. According to Motta and Sáez (2008), this violence emerges fromthe preconception that all members of a particular group must have or develop specificcharacteristics of their community. In this sense, a person’s appearance with differentbodily expressions or gender identities creates negative attitudes and value judgements(Motta and Sáez 2008).Regarding the specific concerns of intersex people, regional recognition and awarenesshave increased considerably in the last decade. For example, in 2013 the IACHR (2013) heldthe first public hearing to understand intersex issues in the region. Intersex activists andadvocates expressed their experiences: the types of violence, not only medical, that intersexpeople suffer during the process of “normalisation”; the clinical methods of standardisingintersex bodies and their irreversible consequences; and the national legislations whichdirectly violate international children rights. As a result, the Commission recognised thesevere violations of human rights that intersex people undergo for having a diverse bodyand gave suggestions to the countries to promote good practices (IACHR 2013).The IACHR (2015) stressed the severe human rights violations that the states com-mit, such as forced sterilisation, genital “normalisation”, denial of medical records andhealth insurance services, secrecy in the procedures, and the absence of informed consent.Conclusively, it encouraged the member states to create public policies and legislation tostop unnecessary medical interventions without free and informed consent; to providesupport to families and intersex children; to generate awareness campaigns on the effects of“normalisation” interventions of intersex children; and to develop educational campaignsto end the stereotypes and invisibility that surround intersex people (IACHR 2015).Unlike Europe, Latin America does not have a clear regionalisation process, whichmeans that, although there are regional entities, normative unification processes are difficultto achieve; this leads to a significant differentiation in the legislation and gathering of datafor the region, which is also heterogeneous in the legal advances regarding the protectionof intersex human rights (Rueda 2009). Nevertheless, forums and collaborations have beenconducted to pursue regional activism. For instance, the San José de Costa Rica Statementwas signed in the First Latin American Regional Conference of Intersex People in 2018.This conference was sought by intersex activists to generate collective demands in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean for stopping human rights violations by the states, regionalinstitutions, medical constituencies and the media (Declaración de San José de Costa Rica2018). The second version of this regional activism meeting was held in 2020 in Argentina;around 30 activists gathered to discuss the human rights situation of intersex people inLatin America (Balderrama 2020).There have been jurisprudential advances in Latin America and the Caribbean; it ispossible to find examples of protection of intersex people from abuses of their human rights.Since there is a considerable difference in terms of the development of intersex humanrights among the countries, it is challenging to make a general review of the topic in theregion; instead, it is more accurate to highlight the major advances of some nations andname specific state regulations whose modification should be considered.Among the positive precedents in intersex human rights protection, Colombia shouldbe mentioned. In the 1990s,21 this country was one of the earliest in the world to establishthe right to the autonomy and bodily integrity of a person when their sex characteristicsdiffer from the traditional binary models (Zelada and Nicoli 2019). Their ConstitutionalCourt (CCC) developed parameters to consider whether it is possible or not to perform amedical intervention: (i) the urgency of the treatment; (ii) the risk and impact on the currentand future autonomy of the minor; and (iii) the age of the minor. These parameters forcethe examination of the consequences of such interventions in the minor’s life, and if theSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 12 of 18treatment is invasive and irreversible, the minor must wait until they are old enough todecide for themselves.22For the protection of the rights of intersex people, in 1999 the Court made a judgementon whether the parents could authorise a medical and surgical intervention for readjustingthe genitals of an intersex infant.23 The Court ruled that the intersex minor must decide thegender with which they identify, and hence, the ruling indicated that the age of five years isthe minimum threshold for a person to consent in an informed way to the possible invasivetreatments. Also, it established that parental consent is legitimate for children under thisage only if informed consent is sufficiently capable of efficiently supporting the decision.24However, in Colombia, no law prohibits the authorities from executing unnecessarymedical interventions on intersex children. According to the document issued by theCapital City Hall, “Diagnosis of the situation of intersex people in Bogotá” (Alcaldía Mayorde Bogotá 2014, own translation), the problem with intersex invisibility in Colombia and theconsequent lack of normative advances is the weak consolidation of intersex as a politicalidentity. Unlike the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans sectors, in the intersex community thereis an absence of leadership that reacts to the confusion and ignorance around being anintersex person (Alcaldía Mayor de Bogotá 2014).There are other relevant Latin American examples that have improved the legalprotection of intersex human rights. For instance, Argentina’s evolution in the recognitionof gender identities has continuously improved, as was the case with the Gender IdentityLaw enacted in 2012, which opened the door to (i) creating a gender identity where peoplecan modify their body without third party considerations, ordering the state to cover thenecessary surgeries and hormonal treatments as part of the Mandatory Medical Plan, (ii)offering guidelines for human rights-based procedures in the rectification of sex registration,and (iii) recognising the citizen’s right to decent treatment, allowing themselves the genderidentity they want, including the use of a different name from the one that appears in theirlegal documents.25This law is a worldwide example because it is not framed in binary categories; on thecontrary, it encourages respect for diversity and self-perception of gender and body, whichhas become a crucial argument for international trans and intersex advocacy (OUT-Right2012). Regarding exclusively intersex matters, in 2020 Argentina proposed a bill elaboratedby intersex and LGBTI activists to guarantee the protection of human rights of people basedon their sex characteristics.26 The bill includes aspects such as the right to bodily and sexualdiversity, the prohibition of any procedure without the full and informed consent of theperson whose body is involved, the right to receive truthful information about the people’ssex characteristics, the right to determine their sex on the medical certificate, the right to beregistered or modify the civil register, the right to have proper social security assistance, theprotection against acts of discrimination, and the creation of a truth commission to clarifythe events that previously occurred in the country related to body modification proceduresfor people with variations of sex characteristics.27It is expected that the approval of this law will change the current situation in Ar-gentina for intersex people, since genital mutilations and other medical procedures are stillbeing carried out in health institutions that continue to recommend early interventions inbabies born with intersex traits (StopIGM 2017, p. 108). In this sense, there remain manyLatin American countries that sponsor, through their public health institutions, unnecessarymedical procedures and pathologising treatment for intersex people (StopIGM 2017, p. 6).For instance, protocols to quickly frame the newborn intersex child in a specific gender areimplemented in Brazilian hospitals. Consequently, medical personnel can proceed withmedical intervention, enforcing under a pathologising language the idea of sex assignationon behalf of the parents (Machado 2009).In Mexico, according to the Periodic Report of the CCPR elaborated by the NGOsStopIGM and Brújula Intersexual (StopIGM 2019c), there is (i) an absence of nationalregulations to stop cosmetic surgeries in intersex children, (ii) a lack of administrativemeasures to enforce the application of the little existing guidance for these people inSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 13 of 18hospitals, (iii) indiscriminate medicalisation of bodily diversity accompanied by degradingtreatment such as repeated genital examinations and photographs for scientific research,which constitute harmful practices, and (iv) pathologising recommendations of earlyinterventions for children in order to “deal” with intersex traits. Thus, the report mentionsthat these practices remain typical, encouraging public health institutions and paediatricassociations to follow treatment guidelines that go against the human rights of intersexpeople (StopIGM 2019c). These are intended under the umbrella of early intervention toprevent future stigmatisation, create “normal” appearances, avoid cancer risk and reducepossible “negative feelings” for the children and their parents. (StopIGM 2019c).Since the region represents a significant gap in creating legal protocols, Costa Rica is an-other example where hospitals implement their procedures to effect medical interventions(Rueda 2017). In their medical institutions, it is more suitable to hide the intersex condition,so the parents will not question the interventions or “create confusion where there is none”(Rueda 2017, s.p.). Thus, intersex traits are still considered a pathology for healthcareproviders, and intersex activism urgently demands change (Rivera and Jiménez 2017).As in Europe, Latin American states lack governmental regulations that strictly forbidgenital mutilation and unnecessary procedures for intersex children (Rivera and Jiménez2017). For instance, Chile issued in December 2015 a legal notification ordering a stop tounnecessary treatments of intersex children (Ministerio de Salud, Gobierno de Chile 2015).Nevertheless, one year later, the government issued a new notification contradicting theinitial one and falling back in protecting the rights of intersex children (Ministerio de Salud,Gobierno de Chile 2016). It defined the condition of hypospadia as a medical emergency,implemented the term Disorders of Sex Development, and changed the wording of the textfrom the “need” to defer to the “possibility” of deferring surgery until the patient can showtrends of sexual identity, among other changes (Ministerio de Salud, Gobierno de Chile2016). For activists, this new regulation was considered a pathologisation of intersex traitsand their further medicalisation. Thus, this notification justified procedures that extendfrom “the intervention through unnecessary and non-consensual hormonal therapies thathave repeatedly resulted in serious consequences to the health of the intersex individual, tosurgeries that can be compared to forced sterilisation and genital mutilation procedures”28(Inter and Aoi 2016, s.p.).This scoping review and legal research, including the review of activist documents,demonstrated that Latin America has a long history of human rights law developmentsand struggles. In this context, intersex people have used international human rightslaw to defend their freedoms and lives against degrading medical treatment, violenceand discrimination. Since Latin America is part of a heterogeneous continent and doesnot display a solid regionalisation process as in Europe, it is essential to analyse whathappens in each country regarding the human rights of intersex people, who in somecases have joined LGBT movements to make more visible the failures of the state towardthem. Although Latin America continues to experience setbacks in the defence of therights to sexual and bodily diversity, there are countries that have stood out worldwide,either because their courts have developed the framework to guarantee human rights, asin Colombia, or because they are making extraordinary progress, as in Argentina, or haveexhaustively researched intersex issues through strong activism, as in the case of Mexico(Alcántara 2019). However, as in Europe, in Latin America, the right of intersex people tothe truth continues to fall into a gap in human rights research.4. ConclusionsThis research explored the current status of intersex human rights in Latin America andEurope. To undertake this aim, a scoping review and legal research, including the reviewof activist documents, were conducted to allow a better understanding of the experiencesof intersex individuals in these regions. Because of this methodology, questions abouthow European and Latin American states have addressed the human rights of intersexpeople and the gaps in legislative measures to protect them were approached. AlthoughSoc. Sci. 2022, 11, 317 14 of 18Europe represents a regionalisation process that translates into parliaments, commissionsand courts, Latin America has shown progress in terms of the inclusion of intersex peoplethrough the IACHR and national courts. Thus, this research identified existing legal sourceson human rights concerning intersex people that mention the exercise of their rights toself-determination and identity, to be protected from cruel and degrading treatment, and tobe effectively included. In addition, there are provisions in Europe and Latin America thatprohibit surgeries on intersex children and violence against them.The analysis of treaties, conventions, regulations, laws, jurisprudence, recommenda-tions, institutional declarations, activist statements and reports evidenced that intersexpeople in Europe and Latin America experience many forms of discrimination and violencebased on stereotypes and myths about what is male and female. Two topics predomi-nate in international human rights law: first, their right to bodily integrity and protectionfrom cruel and degrading treatment in the medical field, and second, their right to self-determination and identity, which is reflected in the possibility of choosing a gender, andthese are evidenced in legal documents. These rights have also emerged in United Nationsinternational regulations as a critical element in guaranteeing intersex people’s humanrights. The YP+10 are essential in this matter and their content appears implicitly orexplicitly in the legal developments of European and Latin American countries.In addition, this research provided insights into how intersex organisations perceivecurrent developments of the human rights framework to protect their rights. For instance,in Europe, intersex organisations have clearly identified violations of the right to integrityand claim for intersex people the right not to be subjected to medical treatments or surgeriesduring infancy. In this case, within Europe, some states’ progress is needed to establish ad-ditional mechanisms that will effectively implement the existing human rights frameworks.In contrast, in Latin America, intersex organisations also identify challenges in the generaldevelopment and recognition of a human rights framework for intersex people. Legalinitiatives are present in some Latin American countries to guarantee the rights of intersexpeople, mainly their rights to bodily integrity, self-determination and identity. However,legal advancements are required concerning the prohibition of sex-normalising surgeries.Another important finding in both regions is the lack of reparation and judicial mechanismsfor intersex people who have been the victims of massive human rights violations duringtheir lives. Legal tools that not only acknowledge but also aim to repair their sufferingare essential to promote real change. The insights provided by this research reveal howimportant it is to continue evaluating the legal framework from a comparative perspectiveto better understand what happens to intersex people in each country within the sameregion and between regions.Whether social beliefs regarding gender, and, thus, the political approaches that prevailin both Europe and Latin America, are obstacles to implementing public policies for intersexpeople remains a pending research question. If European and Latin American societies donot develop a cultural openness toward gender and bodily diversities, intersex individualswill continue to experience violence against their bodies. Consequently, in Europe, it isimportant to continue working on the effective implementation of regulations to protectthe intersex community and the typification of tangible sanctions for non-compliance. Inaddition, in Latin America, it is essential that states commit to developing policies based ona human rights approach to enable intersex people to have a dignified life and independentrecognition. Finally, it is necessary to remember that human rights are not only a tool tobetter interpret the law and create more efficient public policies, but primarily a means toachieve social justice.Funding: The research forms part of the project INIA.

    "abstract": "Today, intersex people of Europe and Latin America are subjected to different degrees of\r\ninvisibility and discrimination for being part of bodily diverse communities. Thus, these experiences\r\nhave been addressed as violations of intersex human rights. This research intends to explore intersex\r\nhuman rights across Europe and Latin America through a scoping review and legal research, including\r\nthe review of activist documents. It seeks to study the experiences of violence suffered by intersex\r\npeople, the role of states in promoting justice, and the possibilities offered by a human rights\r\nframework to guarantee a dignified life for bodily diverse communities. This research also illustrates\r\nthat, although regional, cultural and social landscapes differ in both continents, intersex groups are\r\nsubject to constant violations of their human rights, and they struggle for recognition and for their\r\nbodies to be respected outside the binary categories of sex and gender. Furthermore, European and\r\nLatin American states have made proven legislative advances that have led to the greater visibility of\r\nintersex people but also face remaining difficulties and gaps.European Commission\t85986",
