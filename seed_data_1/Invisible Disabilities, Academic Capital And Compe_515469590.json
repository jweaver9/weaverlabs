Recent research has begun to explore how visible diversity may present barriers to a genetic counseling applicant becoming competitive, but has not yet characterized potential barriers with invisible diversities, such as being a first-generation college student, or a part of the LBGTQ+ community. Therefore, this study aimed to address this gap among those with invisible diversities, as well as explore their academic capital (AC), a theoretical framework used to identify factors that make students more likely to succeed in post-secondary work including supportive networks, trustworthy information, family uplift, college knowledge, overcoming barriers, concerns about cost, familial expectations, and navigation of systems. Genetic counseling applicants for the 2021 and 2022 admissions match cycles were recruited via a multipronged, snowball method and surveyed via Qualtrics (IRB# HSC-MS-21-0477). Responses were analyzed using IBM SPSS [statistical software Version: 28.0.0.0]. Results indicated that individuals who are LGBTQ+ had significantly lower overall AC scores by 6.322 points (p<0.001), particularly in the subcategories of navigation of systems (1.520, p=0.029), supportive networks (1.138, p=0.004), and trustworthy information (0.941, p=0.015). Applicants who identified as being from an NIH disadvantaged background were more likely to have concerns about cost (p<0.001), and lower scores for college knowledge (1.578, p<0.001). Individuals who identify as having a low socioeconomic status had greater concerns about cost (2.485, p=0.013). Lower AC subcategory scores were found for first-vi  generation college students for college knowledge (2.539, p<0.001), and for applicants who spoke English as a second language for supportive networks (1.296, p=0.015) and for college knowledge (1.907, p <0.001). The results show concerns about cost of the application process were prevalent across groups, and that applicants with mentors had significantly higher AC scores (p=0.042). Therefore, the field should implement interventions to assist applicants with invisible diversity to address mentorship, trustworthy information, and costs.               vii  Table of Contents Approval Page……………………………………………………………………….………....i Title Page……………………………………………………………………….………...…...ii Acknowledgements……………………………………………………………………….….iii Abstract………………………………………………………………………………….…….v Table of Contents…………………………………………………………………….……...vii List of Illustrations…………………………………………………………………….   ….viii List of Tables…………………….…………………………………………………….…….ix Introduction…………………………………………………………………………….……..1 Methods…………………………………………………………………………….…….…...4 Results…………………………………………………………………………….……..…....6 Discussion…………………………………………………………………………….……...24 Appendix A…………………………………...……………………………………….……..33 Bibliography………………………………….……………………………………….……..61  Vita…………………………………..………………………………...……….……………64    viii  List of Illustrations Figure 1.

How Intersectionality of Multiple Identities Affected Genetic Counseling Applicants……………………………………………………………………….………......22     1  Introduction Underrepresented minority (URM) groups consistently have less access to healthcare services and higher rates of health problems (Schoonveld et al. 2007). Research suggests better health outcomes are achieved when patients share a common identity with their healthcare provider, yet URMs continue to be underrepresented in healthcare positions (Oh & Lewis 2005). Only 7% of genetic counselors identify as being a URM, which is significantly lower than comparable healthcare professions (Mittman & Downs 2008). These numbers are so low may be because people who identify as a URM continue to face barriers to becoming competitive applicants to healthcare training programs such as genetic counseling.  Studies have started to investigate the factors contributing toward the lack of visible diversity in the genetic counseling profession and attention has also been brought to the lack of representation for other groups, including individuals who are first-generation college students, have an invisible disability such as a mental health condition, or identify as a part of the LBGTQ+ community. To investigate barriers to entering the training pipeline, it is helpful to explore the academic capital underrepresented individuals have when applying to genetic counseling programs. St. John et al. first defined academic capital (AC) as, “social processes that build family knowledge of educational and career options and support navigation through educational systems and professional organizations” (St. John, 2011). In the original investigation of AC factors that made students more likely to succeed in post-secondary education were analyzed; these factors were considered to build AC. They included supportive networks, trustworthy information, family uplift, college knowledge, overcoming barriers, concerns about cost, familial expectations, and navigation of systems. Supportive  2  networks included people in a student’s life that encourage their success and provide emotional support needed in college. Parental support can be particularly important, and students whose parents want them to achieve more than they did had higher rates of associated success; this characterizes family uplift. Higher achievement is also seen in families who have familial expectations to pursue college. Trustworthy information, a student’s trust in their post-secondary educators, also promotes greater success in education. Having role models in a student’s family or communities helps provide college knowledge, which contributes to the social structure to provide a framework for college success. If a student has role models or people they can turn to, and are aware of the resources available in their school, they are able to navigate the systems necessary for success in a post-secondary education. Students with confidence in their abilities to overcome barriers also have greater success in post-secondary education. Lastly, financial resources are important. Students who are confident they can financially afford to complete their education also show greater success. All these factors combined yield a high AC. Past interventions that aim to address inequities in higher education admissions have often failed to address concerns related to low AC (St. John 2011).  Huang et al. (2021) explored AC for applicants to genetic counseling programs who self-described as having an underrepresented racial/ethnic identity. She found both URM applicants and those not underrepresented ranked the same three social processes as most difficult: financial resources, navigation of systems, and college knowledge. However, those who identified as underrepresented had significantly lower AC scores. AC was further reduced for those who felt underrepresented in multiple identities versus those who felt underrepresented in one identity. Of note, different underrepresented groups experienced  3  separate challenges in the social structures needed for success in their education. For example, LGBTQ+ students ranked grade point averages as more challenging than students who are not LGBTQ+. This showed how each group could benefit from uniquely targeted interventions to increase their success in entering post-secondary education, including for genetic counseling programs.  Huang et al. (2021) also found a high proportion of genetic counseling applicant respondents identified with having invisible forms of diversity in addition to visible diversity, and each group reported different barriers to entering the genetic counseling training pipeline. Specifically, applicants who identified as LGBTQ+ received significantly lower AC scores in the subcategories of concerns about cost, navigations of systems, and trustworthy information compared to their counterparts. Huang et al. (2021) also found that students who were disadvantaged per the NIH definition worked more hours through their undergraduate education and had lower GRE scores. People who identify with an invisible underrepresented group, or underrepresented identities that cannot be physically seen, may therefore also benefit from specific targeted interventions to increase accessibility to and competitiveness within the genetic counseling application process.  Invisible diversity was not the area of focus for Huang et al.’s (2021) study. Therefore, this study aimed to explore what barriers are encountered by genetic counseling applicants with invisible diversities in becoming a competitive applicant, and to describe how invisible diversities relate to AC. This study also intended to begin to explore intersectionality. Intersectionality is defined as, \"the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group” (the National Conference for Community and Justice, n.d.).  4  Methods Participants To be eligible to participate, individuals needed to be over the age of eighteen and have been an applicant to a genetic counseling program for matriculation during the fall of 2021 or fall of 2022. Procedures A multipronged snowball recruitment method was used to procure participants for this study. Multiple organizations were contacted and asked to distribute the survey. Organizations included the Minority Genetics Professionals Network (MGPN), Genetic Counselors for Racial Justice, the Association of Genetic Counseling Program Directors, and undergraduate special interest groups. An announcement was placed on the UT Genetic Counseling Program (UTGCP) website and social media channels twice, once in August and once in October. Program directors were asked to consider sending the survey to applicants to their programs for the fall 2022 cycle and to first-year students. The survey was also posted to genetic counseling discussion groups on Discord and Reddit, as well as during the MGPN recruitment event, the UTGCP recruitment event, and the Texas Society of Genetic Counselors (TSGC) prospective student webinar.  The survey was available from August 6, 2021, through December 31, 2021. This study was approved by the UTHealth IRB (HSC-MS-21-0477). Instrumentation The survey consisted of five blocks of questions: two eligibility questions, twenty-five demographics and educational background questions, twenty-eight AC questions, one open-ended intersectionality question, and two additional open-ended questions. The  5  demographic questions asked participants about their identities, including race, sexuality, gender, socioeconomic status, and first-generation status. The education questions were adapted from items listed on webpages of genetic counseling programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling. Open-ended questions assessed how intersectionality affected an applicant’s experience with the application process, specific barriers each applicant experienced, and areas where applicants feel more support in the application process is needed.  Several survey questions were modeled after Huang’s 2021 study of applicants’ visible diversity, competitiveness, and AC. Permission was obtained to mirror questions from the principal investigator (K. Huang, personal communication, November 8, 2020). Additional questions were added to capture invisible diversities and intersectionality.  The survey also included an assessment of applicants’ AC using the Academic Capital Scale (ACS), a validated tool for assessing AC (Winkler & Sriram, 2015). Permission was obtained from the authors in June 2021 to use this scale (C. Winkler, personal communication, June 10, 2021). There were 28 total Likert-style questions to assess the subcategories Winkler and Sriram. determined to contribute toward AC; participants could score each question on a scale from 1 to 6, with a one representing strongly disagreeing with a statement and a six indicating strongly agreeing with the statement. The number of points were added for each of the 28 Likert-style questions to calculate each genetic counseling applicant’s AC score. The Qualtrics Research Platform Software, as a service at UTHealth, was used to generate the anonymous survey (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). The option to provide a name and email address was collected in a separate form upon survey completion for participants to be  6  entered in a drawing for one of ten available gift cards, and/or for permission to be contacted for future studies.  Data Analysis IBM SPSS statistical software (Version: 28.0.0.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was utilized for quantitative data analysis. Calculations were done to reflect descriptive statistics and comparisons were performed via Mann Whitney U tests and Kruskal Wallis tests as appropriate. A regression analysis was used to account for associations between underrepresented identities and AC. Qualitative data analysis of open-ended questions was performed by N.E.S. using inductive, conventional content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). Transcripts were entered into Microsoft Excel (version 2022) and coded for themes that were derived from the data. N.E.S. assigned a label to each unique code, reflecting the underlying concept as it developed and then organized codes into conceptually similar groupings. C.N.S., a female-identifying certified genetic counselor and training program director with 25 years of experience, served as data auditor and independently reviewed ten transcripts for coding and grouping consensus. The codes were discussed until concordance was achieved. N.E.S. analyzed the remaining transcripts (Atkinson & Haj 1996). The inter-coder reliability was 0.97. Results Participants Of 451 submitted surveys, 263 were completed. While a precise survey response rate cannot be calculated, we can extrapolate from the 2021 genetic counseling Match data in which there were 1,065 applicants. Therefore, if roughly the same number of applicants participate in the Match for 2022, there were roughly 2,130 people eligible for the survey,  7  suggesting a 21.1% initial response rate (451/2130) and a 12.3% response rate for completed surveys (263/2130). Since this does not account for applicants who could have applied for both cycles, this may be a slight underrepresentation. Most participants were white (67%), female (93%), cisgender (>99%) applicants who spoke English as their first language (86%) and had no disabilities (65%), (Table 1). The next most reported race or ethnicities were East Asian or Southeast Asian (14%) and Hispanic or Latino (13%). Many sexualities were represented. Most respondents were heterosexual (71%); followed by bisexual (15%), queer (7%), or questioning or unsure (7%). Gender identity was also captured; one person who is transgender completed the survey. Participants reported a variety of first languages, with Spanish (5%) and Vietnamese (2%) most commonly reported following English (86%). Of the 32% of participants who reported an invisible disability, most self-identified as having a mental health condition (61%), such as anxiety or depression.

The top six identity aspects in which applicants felt underrepresented were by race/ethnicity (27%), being a first-generation college student (19%), socioeconomic status (18%), multicultural background (16%), sexual orientation (16%), and religious beliefs (11%), (Figure 1).    10  Figure 1. Self-Reported Underrepresented Identities of Genetic Counseling Applicants (n=263)  Educational Background  Most applicants had a bachelor’s degree (n=205, 78%) and obtained their primary undergraduate education at a four-year public university/college (n=174, 70%), and had a parent or guardian with at least a bachelor’s degree (n=186, 71%). The average GPA was 3.56 (Table 1). Less than 38% of survey respondents reported a GRE score, so this information was removed from analysis. Financial Background  To finance their undergraduate education, just over half of genetic counseling applicants had parental support (n=151, 57%), scholarships (n= 146, 56%), and/or part-time jobs (n= 132, 50%), (Table 2).

To prepare for their application, most participants were able to obtain advocacy experience (defined as bereavement counseling, crisis counseling/texting, working with individuals with a disability or genetic condition, or other similar activities) (n= 206, 78%), conduct informational interviews with genetic counselors  12  (n= 203, 77%), attend informational webinars (n=203, 77%), shadow a genetic counselor (n=159, 60%), and/or be in a research position (n= 147, 56%), (Table 3).

This was followed by costs, which could be incurred by GRE fees, application fees, and transcript fees, (Table 3). Academic Capital Scores The median AC score was 132 (IQR 18). The subcategories for which applicants had the lowest average scores were financial resources (18/30, 60%), navigation of systems (22/30, 73%), and trustworthy information (14/18, 78%), (Table 4).

Specifically, overall AC scores were significantly lower (6.322 points, p<0.001) for applicants who are LGBTQ+ compared to those who are not. Particular subcategory scores were also significantly lower among LGBTQ+ applicants; navigation of system scores were 1.520 points lower (p=0.029), supportive network scores were 1.138 points lower (p=0.004), and trustworthy information scores were 0.941 points lower than applicants who are not LGBTQ+ (p=0.015). AC  14  subcategory scores were also significantly lower for applicants who met the National Institute of Health (NIH) definition of disadvantaged in the areas of financial resources         (-4.556 points, p<0.001) and college knowledge (-1.524 points, p<0.001). The AC subcategory of financial resources was also significantly lower for applicants who felt underrepresented by their socioeconomic status (-2.483 points, p=0.013). First-generation college students had college knowledge AC subcategory scores that were 2.603 AC points lower than their counterparts (p<0.001); however, their family uplift subcategory scores were 2.051 points higher (p=0.028). Students who speak English as a second language had AC subcategory scores that were 1.319 points lower for supportive networks (p=0.015), 1.986 lower for college knowledge (p<0.001), and 1.931 points higher for family uplift (p=0.028). Students who had different education backgrounds, like attending a community college as their primary undergraduate institution, had 2.302 higher AC scores for the subcategory navigation of systems (p=0.029). Students who had different religious beliefs had higher subcategory scores of financial resources by 2.209 points (p=0.045), and for family expectations by 1.254 (p=0.009). There were no significant differences for students with invisible disabilities or medical conditions, non-citizens, or veterans (Table 5).     15  Table 5: Regression for Academic Capital Score and Subcategories for Applicants with Invisible Diversities Total Academic capital score coefficients Navigation of systems subcategory coefficients Family uplift subcategory coefficients  Supportive networks subcategory coefficients Financial Resources subcategory coefficients Trustworthy information subcategory coefficients Overcoming barriers subcategory coefficients Family expectations subcategory coefficients College knowledge subcategory coefficients LGBTQ+ (n=71) 6.322 1.520 0.755 1.138 1.083 0.941 0.488 0.254 0.165 Invisible disability or invisible medical condition (n= 83) 1.314 0.596 0.075 -0.587 0.308 0.138 0.418 -0.270 0.527 NIH Disadvantaged background (n= 97) 3.799 -0.114 -1.952 0.234 4.556 -0.744 0.081 0.175 1.524 Low socioeconomic status (n= 48) 4.087 1.154 -0.742 0.157 2.483 -0.035 0.498 0.033 0.532 First-generation college student (n= 49) 3.194 1.383 -2.051 0.877 0.209 0.122 -0.170 0.269 2.603 English-as-a-second language (n= 37) 3.298 1.778 -1.931 1.319 1.087 -0.013 -0.229 -0.643 1.986 Education background (n= 28) 4.434 2.302 0.985 0.387 0.901 -0.169 -0.465 0.638 -0.191 Religious beliefs (n= 30) -3.266 0.361 1.085 0.044 -2.209 0.046 -0.377 -1.254 -1.000 Citizenship status (n=21) -3.830 -1.817 -1.388 0.221 0.052 -0.731 -0.436 0.469 -0.295 Veteran status (n= 5) -1.571 -2.645 0.217 -0.948 3.298 -1.340 0.036 -0.836 0.478 *The regression coefficient states that on average the ACS score (or any of the subcategories) changes by X units for those that identify with that specific diversity compared to those who do not.

This included age, visible disability or medical condition, race/ethnicity, multicultural background, and gender expression. However, there were significant differences in several subcategory AC scores for people underrepresented by race/ethnicity. Specifically, financial resources scores were 1.677 points lower (p=0.043), and college knowledge scores were 1.700 points lower (p<0.001) for individuals with visible diversities. However, family uplift scores were 2.590 points higher for URMs than those not underrepresented by race/ethnicity (p<0.001) and people underrepresented by having a multicultural background had college knowledge subcategory scores that were 1.266 points higher than their counterparts (p=0.026), (Table 6).         17   Table 6: Regression for Academic Capital Score and Subcategories for Applicants with Visible Diversities    Total Academic capital score coefficients Navigation of systems subcategory coefficients Family uplift subcategory coefficients  Supportive networks subcategory coefficients Financial resources subcategory coefficients Trustworthy information subcategory coefficients Overcoming barriers subcategory coefficients Family expectations subcategory coefficients College knowledge subcategory coefficients Race (n=71) 1.170 0.947 -2.590 0.408 1.677 -0.481 -0.277 -0.213 1.700 Age (n= 16) -0.527 1.108 -1.013 -0.916 0.668 -0.043 0.554 -0.518 -0.367 Visible diversity/medical condition (n= 10) -3.452 -0.046 -1.720 -0.776 0.342 1.579 -1.173 -0.984 -0.672 Multicultural background (n= 41) 1.145 0.268 1.623 0.482 0.578 0.021 -0.207 -0.394 -1.226 Gender expression (n= 19) 5.445 1.064 0.903 0.522 0.369 1.116 0.371 0.444 0.626 *The regression coefficient states that on average the ACS score (or any of the subcategories) changes by X units for those that identify with that specific diversity compared to those who do not.

A post-hoc Dunn’s test showed a statistically significant difference between applicants who had two or more underrepresented identities compared to applicants who had no underrepresented identities (ACS: 130 vs 138, respectively; p<0.001). Additionally, applicants who had one underrepresented identity had a statistically significant difference between applicants who had no underrepresented identities (ACS: 131 vs 138, respectively; p<0.001), (Table 7).

Many applicants (43%) described the financial burden as limiting the number of graduate schools to which they applied, while some (12%) reported time as a barrier (Table 9).       20  Table 9. Most Common Barriers to Number of Applications Submitted Barrier Count  n= 149 Illustrative Quote Financial 113 (76%) “Cost!!!!! Everything is so expensive. I don’t qualify for fee waivers, but applying to only five schools was over $1,000.” Time 31 (21%) “[…] Time and effort (mostly having to do with the amount of writing needed for multiple personal statements and statements of purpose).” Location 21 (14%) “Yes, there were barriers to the number of applications I was able to submit. I am a 28-year-old mother of two girls who needs to stay within driving distance to my potential program.” Requirements 17 (11%) “With covid, I was waitlisted for a lot of advocacy last cycle and was unable to get shadowing experience. With a different major, I didn't have all the prereqs, so I had to take some summer courses.”   Applicants were asked to describe what resources would have been helpful in applying to genetic counseling programs. Guidance from a genetic counselor mentor was most commonly cited (21%), followed by the request for a common application (16%), (Table 10).  Table 10. Most Requested Items to Navigate Genetic Counseling Program Applications Resource Count n=187 Illustrative Quote Genetic counselor mentor 54 (29%) “Having a mentor with a similar background that has successfully navigated through the process.” Common application 42 (22%) “All the programs essentially require the same basic application elements. With this in mind I would love to see the programs work together to create a streamlined application that can be sent to all programs a student wants to apply to. I think this would help alleviate some stress of having to make sure all these components are in place in any number of different applications and may make it easier for programs to handle applications too.” Financial assistance 21 (11%) “Complete transparency about cost of programs. It is difficult to find information about costs of programs on their website, and I usually get taken to other sites to find it on my own which is difficult to navigate. There is also not full transparency about the  21  amount of financial aid/scholarships/grants that programs can offer. I am not able to apply to programs that offer no aid, and since I cannot tell on some program websites if they offer aid, I have ruled out applying to many programs because of their lack of information about providing aid to students.” Centralized information 19 (10%) “Straightforward information regarding tuition expenses and health care coverage for myself and spouse while attending grad school.” Informational webinars 15 (8%) “I think the informational webinars hosted by the genetic counseling programs have been extremely helpful in supporting my search for aspects that I am looking for in a program. On websites, it can be difficult to differentiate each program to determine what makes that program unique but being able to interact with faculty and students from programs makes the process a lot more personal. Attending various workshops which focus on different aspects of the application also provides a lot of support for prospective students.” Writing assistance 12 (6%) “Genetic counselors/current students willing to proof read personal statements/cvs” Help for diverse applicants 12 (6%) “More resources for advocacy experience for my expressed gender” More shadowing opportunities 9 (5%) “More shadowing opportunities— where I was from it was difficult to get in person shadowing, and the pandemic compounded those issues.” Awareness of profession in undergraduate institutions 9 (5%) “More awareness from my previous-health advisors in college — not being pushed toward MD/DO or nursing as my only healthcare field options. […]”   Respondents were asked to describe how the intersectionality of identifying with multiple underrepresented groups impacted them as a potential genetic counseling student. Responses were relatively unique, with a few reporting that intersectionality provides them with direction (8%), made them feel like an outsider (6%), raised concerns about being  22  LGBTQ+ (6%), or raised concerns about being from a low socioeconomic class (5%), (Table 11). Table 11. How Intersectionality of Multiple Identities Affected Genetic Counseling Applicants Item Code Count n=69 Illustrative Quote Provides direction 20 (29%) “Being from a Minority group, there are so many challenges to face when doing this such as trying to further my education. I think that me fighting for my future helps to open doors for more people like me to not be afraid to fight for their dreams.” Feeling like an outsider 16 (23%) “Being a part of an underrepresented group makes me wearier of being excluded from the community aspect of this career because I am not certain that I will fit in with other genetic counselors.” LGBTQ+ concerns 15 (22%) “Being nonbinary in medicine is somewhat uncommon in my experience and it's very uncomfortable to navigate power dynamics and have to educate professors, peers, coworkers, and patients on being nonbinary/queer” Low socioeconomic status concerns 12 (17%) “While I don't think of myself as low SES necessarily, I am working full time in the service industry to support myself while in school which seems to be unusual for applicants. I am also older than the typical applicant. Because I am working full time in addition to taking classes, I feel I am at a disadvantage getting crisis counseling hours. If I took the time off work to go to the extensive training the most \"desirable\" opportunities require, I would fall below the hours threshold at work and lose my health insurance or income I need to survive. Furthermore, I don't have time to talk a lot after classes or do research with professors, so I know my recommendation letters will not be as personalized as students who have had time to really bond with their professors outside of class, or research with them. Internships or low paid GCA positions are not options for me.” Nervousness/anxiety 8 (12%) “[…] I’m nervous about how to navigate certain aspects of professional, academic, and social situations given that my ADHD affects how I interact with others.” Need for mentor 7 (10%) “It impacts me because I carry the burden of many by having a unique intersectionality. It also affects me  23  because it's hard for me to find role models who are like me - which in turn makes it hard to find GC mentors.” Mental illness 7 (10%) “I am trans, neurodivergent and mentally ill. Every class photo I see online of GC classes are predominantly white cis able bodied women, and while I don’t know the intricacies of their mental health, I do know that they all appear pretty gender conforming. This makes me nervous because I don’t know if I will be an outsider in my future program. On top of that, my mental illness and neurodivergence makes it more difficult for me to succeed in school. I am worried I won’t be able to receive accommodations. I am also worried I will get overwhelmed and burn out.” Person of color 7 (10%) “As a woman of color, it has made me feel like an outsider and that I don’t entirely belong.” First-generation college student concerns 7 (10%) “As a first generation college student and the first born of parents and grandparents who did not attend college, I feel as though I am navigating college, finances, applications, and exploring master’s programs all on my own with a lack of mentorship from close people I can trust.” Consideration of prejudice/hate 6 (9%) “I feel there aren't any past applicants that could help me make my application, and the admissions board don't have the same background as me so there is the worry of implicit bias.” Asian American concerns 6 (9%) “As a queer Asian American GC prospective applicant, I want to attend a program that values and sees my worth. I don’t want to be tokenized. I want my program faculty to see the potential I have to bring about change to the field. I cannot attend a program that does not protect its students of underrepresented identities.” Feeling disadvantaged 6 (9%) “I wish my culture and experiences that have shaped me could help me in the application process. However, I find myself to be disadvantaged and unfortunately I am not a competitive applicant yet, so I have to work twice as hard.” Latina concerns 4 (8%) “I am a transgender, latina from Costa Rica who would need financial aid to study. I believe all these challenges give me a unique or distinguished perspective on life which would be good for the program’s diversity. I just hope they see it that way, as the advantages I’ve acquired from the challenges I’ve overcome.”     24  Discussion  This study sought to describe barriers to becoming a competitive genetic counseling applicant that are experienced by those who self-identify as having an invisible diversity. It also sought to describe AC for individuals with invisible diversity. Additionally, this study began to explore intersectionality and how it may impact the interventions needed by underrepresented applicants to achieve entry into the genetic counseling training pipeline. By identifying barriers for applicants with specific underrepresented identities, interventions can be developed in order to increase accessibility to and diversity within genetic counseling training programs.   When investigating specific underrepresented groups with invisible diversity, LGBTQ+ students appeared to be a group that could particularly benefit from targeted interventions due to their significantly lower AC scores both overall and within unique subcategories. Specifically, LGBTQ+ students had lower subcategory AC scores for navigation of systems, supportive networks, and trustworthy information. Since LGBTQ+ students may be less trusting of information received by their post-secondary institution, distributing genetic counseling information to other trusted organizations may be helpful. Past research has found that gay-straight alliance (GSA) membership has been associated with members’ higher academic success, feelings of empowerment, and feelings of safety (Toomey, 2011). To increase access to information and resources regarding genetic counseling for applicants who identify as LGBTQ+, materials could be distributed through outreach to groups like gay-straight alliances on undergraduate campuses. Additionally, genetic counseling programs demonstrating support of LGBTQ+ organizations at their home institution may signal a more inclusive graduate experience for potential applicants.  25  Increasing access to information would also be helpful for other invisible underrepresented groups. First-generation college students had particularly low AC in the subcategory of college knowledge. Research has shown that first-generation college students often face unique challenges compared to their peers. For example, first-generation college students experience lower levels of connectedness to their college, are more likely to be working a full or part-time job, and are more likely to experience struggles unique to being a part of an ethnic or racial minority (Goldman, 2020). At the undergraduate level, prior successful interventions have focused on skills training for first-generation college students, including discussions about networking, discussions about support systems on and off campus, and conducting informational interviews. These interventions helped increase the likelihood of first-generation college students seeking support while improving relationships with instructors (Schwartz, 2018). Similar skills training could be implemented as an intervention for genetic counseling applicants who identify as being a first-generation college student. One method of providing training opportunities could be through informational webinars, which were identified as a resource which could be helpful in navigating genetic counseling applications by some applicants. Of note, applicants who speak English as a second language and those who met the NIH disadvantaged criteria also had significantly lower AC scores in college knowledge. Research has shown that first-generation college students are more likely to have a low socioeconomic status, be a nonnative English speaker, and be a racial/ethnic minority (Ives, 2020). Therefore, skills training as an intervention could prove beneficial for applicants from several different invisible diversity groups while maximizing the efforts of genetic counseling programs.  26  Another area of focus that would address concerns from multiple applicant groups is with regard to costs. Not only do a staggering proportion of students have concerns about affording their genetic counseling applications, but many underrepresented groups also had significantly lower AC scores for financial resources. Cost was cited by most as the greatest barrier to the number of applications students submitted. In 2021, the median amount spent by genetic counseling applicants in one admission cycle was $2,634 (Lee, 2021). Efforts should be expanded to provide need-based aid for applicants experiencing financial barriers if the field hopes to move towards equity in the admissions process. This is in concordance with the recommendations provided by the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) 2021 Exeter report on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts within NSGC. The Exeter group recommended scholarship and grant opportunities for applicants to address barriers to entry into the profession, and that funding not have a prescribed use (The Exeter Group, 2021). Providing this financial assistance would be particularly beneficial for NIH disadvantaged students, and students with a low socioeconomic status. Importantly, applicants who identified as either first-generation college student, or from an NIH disadvantaged background, or who learned English as a second language, showed significantly higher subcategory scores for family uplift.  This suggests that applicants who have family support may be more likely to overcome other barriers such as cost and college knowledge and make it to the genetic counseling pipeline when their support network is behind their decision to pursue graduate education. This is concordant with findings from previous research. Goodall (2018) found that parental engagement in learning is the best method for closing the achievement gap between children of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. With parental or family support, students may have greater  27  success pursuing graduate school. Those who have lower levels of family support may particularly benefit from mentorship in the genetic counseling community. Some underrepresented groups of genetic counseling applicants had no significantly different AC subcategory scores when compared to students in majority groups. Invisible diversities without significant differences were veterans, those with different education backgrounds, those with invisible disabilities such as mental illness and visa holders. It is possible these students have existing supports in place giving them higher AC scores. For example, many schools have services available to provide support for military veterans or an international office for visa holders. In addition, universities have begun to devote more resources to supporting students’ mental health, as mental health problems contribute to negative outcomes in undergraduate education, including lower grades, delayed graduation, and dropping out (Ashwood, 2016). With increased access to mental health services, students may feel more confident in their abilities to overcome any barriers to their success in post-secondary education. This is particularly important as Cantor et al. (2018) found that roughly 44% of genetic counseling students have experienced mental illness during their training. They also found students with mental illness experienced fear of discrimination and labeling. Students indicated that genetic counseling programs could help by sharing mental health resources, creating safe environments, facilitating peer support, having informal check-ins, and by addressing mental health at the beginning of training (Cantor, 2018). Destigmatizing mental health has been shown to help graduate students by preventing a decline in academic performance and increasing professionalism and compassion for patients (Quek et al., 2019). Therefore, despite some groups having no significant differences in AC score subcategories,  28  it is important to continue to support these groups and to consider how intersectionality may plays a role in their readiness for graduate school. Approximately one third of respondents indicated that they felt underrepresented in two or more ways. The intersection of multiple identities may impact how a student interacts with the genetic counseling application process. Pairwise comparison showed there was not a significant difference between applicants who had one underrepresented identity and those who had two or more underrepresented identities. This suggests that some interventions, such as those that address cost concerns, should be universally available to applicants who identify with at least one underrepresented group. However, attention should be paid to how intersectionality may play a role in which interventions are most beneficial for a unique applicant who has two or more underrepresented identities.  When asked how the intersectionality of multiple identities affected genetic counseling applicants, many respondents identified the desire for a mentor. There is evidence that mentorship could reduce barriers for genetic counseling applicants, as those who had a genetic counselor or genetic counseling student mentor had significantly higher AC scores (p= 0.042). It is also possible that students who had a mentor accessed one because they had higher AC. Mentorship was also a theme in open-ended responses, with many students indicating a need for a mentor from a comparable background who has overcome similar obstacles.  Currently, there is a mentor program through the Minority Genetic Professionals Network that matches people in the genetics field with a mentor (Minority Genetic Professionals Network, n.d.). Mentees can be high school students, undergraduate students, or genetic counseling assistants. They can request a mentor with similar race/ethnicity,  29  sexuality, religion, disability status, citizenship status, first-generation status, and gender identity. To be a part of the MGPN, mentors and mentees must be from a minority racial or ethnic group. Within their program there are opportunities for students with other underrepresented identities to receive support and mentorship (Minority Genetic Professionals Network). Similar initiatives could be implemented to create other mentorship programs to reach students who do not qualify for MGPN but may be underrepresented in other ways, such as LBGTQ+ or first-generation college students who are not people of color. MGPN could serve as an example for other initiatives to promote increasing AC and providing resources for becoming a competitive genetic counseling applicant. It may particularly help applicants’ ability to navigate systems and have a supportive network, as these were the two subcategories with significant increases in AC scores when applicants had a mentor. One group who could lead the initiative is NSGC. In fact, a recommendation of the NSGC Exeter report is to implement a mentorship process (The Exeter Group, 2021). Study Limitations  While this study was the first to delve into invisible diversities of genetic counseling applicants, it was limited by a relatively small sample size of approximately 12% of eligible participants. In addition, there is likely ascertainment bias in who chose to complete the survey. Part of recruitment included distributing the survey to the genetic counseling program director listserv. While program directors could have distributed the survey to any applicant who applied to their program, it is possible it was distributed more widely to first years in their programs since they are in contact with them more regularly. Since current GC students were successful in being matched, they may have been more competitive genetic counseling applicants with higher AC scores. Additionally, the survey was distributed to  30  undergraduate genetic counseling special interest groups and applicant platforms. These applicants may have had greater access to resources which could be reflected in their AC scores.  In addition, the small sample limited the ability to further investigate intersectionality, since there were not enough participants in some subcategories to conduct a pairwise analysis of different combinations of underrepresentation. Groups like veterans had particularly small sample sizes. Therefore, future studies may wish to employ more rigorous recruitment strategies in order to better investigate intersectionality.   Since this research was modeled off the study conducted by Huang et al. (2021), some limitations from the previous study method carried over. For example, the AC scale was originally developed to measure AC scores in students at-risk to not finish their undergraduate degrees and was adapted for use in genetic counseling applicants. Another limitation was the low completion rate, which kept the overall sample size low. Despite decreasing the overall length of the survey to help address the high number of incomplete surveys faced by Huang et al. (2021), approximately half of participants who began the survey did not complete it. Future Implications  This study reaffirms the need to assist genetic counseling applicants from underrepresented groups in accessing the genetic counseling pipeline. Further studies should continue to investigate the best method for outreach for systemically excluded populations. Many participants indicated that having a genetic counselor or genetic counseling student mentor would be helpful. Moving forward, the field should ascertain whether it is a lack of mentorship opportunities for specific groups, or a lack of knowledge about existing  31  mentorship opportunities that is driving the desire for mentorship. If it is a lack of knowledge about existing opportunities, information on existing opportunities can be distributed in preferred platforms. This study could not conclude whether students with genetic counseling mentors had higher AC because they had a mentor, or whether students who had higher AC were more likely to have a mentor. Huang et al. (2021) found that most students accessed her survey through online discussion forums and program websites, so these platforms could be used to promote new or existing mentorship platforms for genetic counseling applicants. National organizations that have centralized information about programs, such as NSGC, AGCPD, ACGC, and ABGC could also direct applicants to mentorship opportunities that already exist, such as MGPN, or that are built as the field continues to address outstanding needs, such as those of LGBTQ+ applicants and first-generation college students. In addition, the field must put additional resources towards the cost of the application in order to bring more individuals into the genetic counseling pipeline.  While this study invited participants to share about the intersectionality of their underrepresented identities, it was not the main focus of this project, and the groups were not large enough for comparison. The field would benefit from an in-depth study of intersectionality in genetic counseling applicants. This could allow developed interventions to be even more targeted for the unique needs of individuals from multiple underrepresented groups. Practice Implications  This study sought to describe the barriers to becoming a competitive genetic counseling applicant experienced by genetic counseling applicants with invisible diversities, and by assessing how AC plays a role in these barriers. Individuals who identified as NIH  32  disadvantaged, having a low socioeconomic status, being a first-generation college student, or speakers of English as a second language had significantly lower AC subcategory scores for concerns about cost of the application process showing a need for financial assistance in applications. This study also demonstrated clear benefit from having a mentor as reflected in significantly higher AC scores. Mentorship programs may also help individuals from NIH disadvantaged background and first-generation students who both showed lower AC subcategory scores for college knowledge. Therefore, increasing mentorship programs and decreasing costs would be helpful for many applicants with invisible diversities. LBGTQ+ applicants may benefit from interventions focused on partnering with LGBTQ organizations to address concerns with supportive networks, trustworthy information and navigating systems that appear to be unique to this underrepresented group. To increase diversity in the genetic counseling profession across different invisible diversities there is a need for interventions in the system through skills training, providing financial assistance, partnership with gay-straight alliances, and mentorship.                    33   Appendix A Copy of Survey  Start of Block: Default Question Block  Q1 Are you currently 18 years or older and will you have completed an undergraduate degree by the start date of the genetic counseling program to which you are applying for?  o Yes  (1) ________________________________________________ o No  (2) ________________________________________________    Q2 Did you apply to a genetic counseling program for fall 2021 admissions or will you apply to a genetic counseling program for the next fall 2022 admissions cycle? o Yes  (1)  o No  (2)   Skip To: Q3 If Did you apply to a genetic counseling program for fall 2021 admissions or will you apply to a gen... = Yes Skip To: End of Survey If Did you apply to a genetic counseling program for fall 2021 admissions or will you apply to a gen... = No   Q44 The following questions will ask you information about your identity.

    "abstract": "The field of genetic counseling has historically lacked diversity. Recent research has begun to explore how visible diversity may present barriers to a genetic counseling applicant becoming competitive, but has not yet characterized potential barriers with invisible diversities, such as being a first-generation college student, or a part of the LBGTQ+ community. Therefore, this study aimed to address this gap among those with invisible diversities, as well as explore their academic capital (AC), a theoretical framework used to identify factors that make students more likely to succeed in post-secondary work including supportive networks, trustworthy information, family uplift, college knowledge, overcoming barriers, concerns about cost, familial expectations, and navigation of systems. Genetic counseling applicants for the 2021 and 2022 admissions match cycles were recruited via a multipronged, snowball method and surveyed via Qualtrics (IRB# HSC-MS-21-0477). Responses were analyzed using IBM SPSS [statistical software Version: 28.0.0.0]. Results indicated that individuals who are LGBTQ+ had significantly lower overall AC scores by 6.322 points (p\\u3c0.001), particularly in the subcategories of navigation of systems (1.520, p=0.029), supportive networks (1.138, p=0.004), and trustworthy information (0.941, p=0.015). Applicants who identified as being from an NIH disadvantaged background were more likely to have concerns about cost (p\\u3c0.001), and lower scores for college knowledge (1.578, p\\u3c0.001). Individuals who identify as having a low socioeconomic status had greater concerns about cost (2.485, p=0.013). Lower AC subcategory scores were found for first-generation college students for college knowledge (2.539, p\\u3c0.001), and for applicants who spoke English as a second language for supportive networks (1.296, p=0.015) and for college knowledge (1.907, p \\u3c0.001). The results show concerns about cost of the application process were prevalent across groups, and that applicants with mentors had significantly higher AC scores (p=0.042). Therefore, the field should implement interventions to assist applicants with invisible diversity to address mentorship, trustworthy information, and costs",
