The strategy was implemented in mid-2019 after a year of transition funding and the issuance of a wide-ranging request for concepts.In the first report, covering 2018–19, we focused on docu-menting our baseline measures, summarizing learnings to date, and issuing a list of recommendations for strategy adjustments and follow-up. This report covers grant data and outcomes from Q4 of 2019 through Q3 of 2020, with a few more recent updates where relevant. Since grant reports are a prime source of data and information for Social Justice Program evaluations, there is a natural lag time between the awarding of a grant, the completion of the grant period (or its first year in the case of multiyear grants), and the submission of a report, which is due to Arcus 30 days after the grant period ends. Thus, for example, grants awarded in Q4 of 2020 (i.e., in December) would be active during calendar 2021 with reports due  January 31, 2022.This report presents an update of progress against the goals and objectives laid out in the Social Justice strategy. In 2023, the Social Justice Program will release a so-called “deep dive” report that will examine each indicator (i.e., measure of progress) against baselines to assess progress over the first five years of the strategy (2018–22). The following information is included in this annual  evaluation report:n An overview of the program’s theory of change at the goal level and across goalsn An exploration of key strategy implementation questionsn An analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Social Justice grantees and the communities in which  they workn Two in-depth analyses of the strategy at work: Mexico  in the international portfolio and Arizona and Georgia  in the U.S. portfolion A summary of outcomes in the remaining regions,  countries, and U.S. states within each goal arean An analysis of grant data in 2020n Findings, learnings, and recommendations.Return to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportReturn to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 20212PAGELGBTQ people, and particularly those most marginalized, are at risk of discrimination and violence around the world. Arcus has focused on LGBTQ people in specific regions of significant need and where there is an opportunity for change—not only where threats to the lives of LGBTQ people are acute, but also where the Foundation can make a  difference based on our knowledge, contacts, and partners on the ground. We place a significant emphasis on LGBTQ people of color, trans communities, refugees, and those living at the intersections of these identities, because of the particular challenges and difficulties they face. These are some of the most marginalized communities—or as we prefer to say, communities pushed to the margins—who are thus under the greatest threat of violence and discrimination.Our consultations with the leaders in the field, as well as our own work in LGBTQ social justice since the Foundation’s inception, led us to focus on three goals: increased safety, increased protections and the curtailing of harmful policy, and increased acceptance and inclusion. All three together are necessary ingredients for LGBTQ people to live their authentic lives with dignity.Theory of ChangeGoal LevelWithin each of these goal areas, we are focused on specific objectives where we believe Arcus can contribute to change.Increased SafetyGOAL 1Across all of the geographic regions in which we fund, the safety of LGBTQ people is a critical threshold issue. Without safety, it is difficult, if not impossible, for LGBTQ commu-nities to gain visibility, power, and influence in order to advocate for protections and inclusion. To increase safety, our theory of change focuses on the following:n Gathering and using documentation of hate violence and discrimination. Violence and discrimination can be addressed only if the crisis is made visible with evidence.n Protecting, empowering, and advocating for those impacted by a lack of safety. Those most pushed to the margins, including migrants and trans women of color, may initially require the protection and assistance of allies and advocates, but must also be empowered to articulate and advocate for their needs, since they are in the best position to know what is needed to keep them safe. n Supporting community-generated safety initiatives. Many of the communities we support in our focus coun-tries and U.S. states are creating and implementing their own visions of safety that do not rely on policy change or interventions by criminal justice systems. We believe these new visions of safety may have the potential to protect those most at risk while fostering community institutions and leadership.The U.S. program director and program officer are  conducting a consultative process with grantees and other relevant stakeholders that aims to sharpen our approach to increasing safety in our focal regions, with a specific focus on better understanding the community-generated safety initiatives that are being implemented as alternatives to reliance on law enforcement.Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2Policy change is a necessary ingredient to promoting safety, acceptance, and the ability of LGBTQ people to thrive. This work involves advocacy on behalf of positive protections, such as nondiscrimination and identity-document change, as well as organizing to stop or curtail harmful policy  proposals such as religious exclusions or restrictions on  transition-related health care. Our theory of change to  increase protections includes the following:n Base building and mobilization. A large and active  base of support is the fuel that advocacy organizations need to build the kind of power and influence necessary  to successfully change policy. n Grassroots, “grasstops,” and public advocacy. Advocacy by experts, by large numbers of community members, and through the media are all important tactics to both pro-mote positive policy change and stop harmful proposals.n Strategic litigation. Long an important part of Arcus’ social justice support, strategic litigation, which has been so successful in the United States, is increasingly being used in East and southern Africa, the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico to increase protections.The Social Justice Program  Strategy and Theory of ChangeReturn to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 20213PAGESupport the enablers of policy and social changeWhen taken together, the goal-level objectives described in the preceding section comprise, as a group, enablers of change: documentation, base building and mobilization, advocacy, strategic litigation, lifting of pro-LGBTQ faith  voices, fair and accurate reporting, and community- generated initiatives.Provide grantees with adequate flexibilityThe opportunities and challenges presented to Arcus  grantees change and shift regularly. With a new U.S.  administration have come new possibilities and threats. At the state and country levels, well-funded opponents are engaging in multi-issue culture wars that manifest in new policy proposals on a variety of issues. These threats mean that grantees must be able to pivot and flex their priorities and tactics, and therefore their funding must be flexible and sustained. Thus, when possible, the Social Justice Program provides its grantees with multiyear general operating sup-port that takes into account the shifting landscape grantees face but nevertheless advances grantees’ missions and plans, as well as Arcus goals and indicators.We are committed to aligning our funding with our strategic objectives, which means remaining focused on our objectives and engaging in an evaluation process that identifies areas of impact, areas of challenge, learnings, and the need for adjustments when necessary.Addressing Strategy  Implementation QuestionsTo ensure that our strategy is on track and advancing, we ad-dressed the following questions to assess whether our funding is focused on the most pressing issues facing our target  populations and whether the grantees we support are effec-tively advancing the goals and objectives of this strategy.1. How do we know we are focused on the most pressing issues facing LGBTQ people most pushed to the margins in our focus regions?In both the development of our strategy and its subsequent implementation, Social Justice Program directors and  officers consistently source information and feedback through deep consultation with grantees and other stake-holders. Our efforts balance the need to be disciplined in aligning grants with the objectives of our strategy (as detailed above) and the need to ensure that the assumptions that underpin the strategy are tested for validity throughout the implementation time period. Consultation takes two main forms: 1) retention of consultants to conduct extensive Increased Acceptance and InclusionGOAL 3The Arcus Social Justice Program is working to increase acceptance and inclusion by focusing on two objectives in which we have seen positive outcomes throughout our decades of work.n Increasing the visibility and influence of faith leaders and faith messages. Allied faith leaders command the  respect of their congregants, other faith leaders, and public officials. Their words and messages garner the attention of the media, and they are often given their own public platforms through broadcast and online vehicles. Given their influence, it is critical to LGBTQ acceptance, protections, and safety that allied faith leaders be sup-ported in their efforts to speak out to multiple audiences.n Improving the accuracy and fairness of media  reporting. Given the pervasiveness of the media and  the influence it has, particularly on issues where public opinion is still fluctuating, the Social Justice Program supports efforts to promote fair and accurate reporting through media monitoring, advocacy, and training. Our primary focus is on reporting on trans communities with regard to eliminating misgendering and “dead naming.”Both the Arcus International and U.S. portfolio staff teams are in the process of better defining our faith-related  funding. On the international side, we have commissioned an external evaluation of faith efforts in East Africa with the objective of gaining a better understanding of what approaches have been effective. On the U.S. side, the 2019 request for concepts process did not adequately surface requests from faith-based organizations working to advance LGBTQ justice in our focal states. As a result, we are retaining a consultant to conduct a scoping project that will identify  potential faith grantees that can be funded in early 2022. Program-Wide Strategic Objectives Across all of these goal areas, and across all of the regions in which we fund, the Arcus Social Justice Program’s theory of change points to the following objectives:Support ecosystems of organizationsIt is rare that one organization by itself brings about  impactful change. That is why the Arcus Social Justice Program funds ecosystems of organizations working on the same or similar issues and employing a range of tactics. Many of these groups are based in the U.S. states or in coun-tries that we have prioritized for support. Others are regional or national in scope (in the case of the United States) but are authentically partnering with those closest to the ground.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 20214PAGEterventions are sustainable, particularly those that involve a seemingly never-ending cycle of training activities. As  a result, Program Officer Erica Lim commissioned an evaluation to better understand the types of faith-related efforts that can be effective in East Africa. That research has been completed with final recommendations based  on those findings available in early 2022.2. Are the grantees we support advancing the goals and objectives of the strategy?Implied in this question is its corollary: are we funding “the right grantees”? In some ways, this question is impossible to answer in the abstract, since it implies knowledge of whether there are other organizations, which if funded, could achieve more. (To be clear, when such organizations come to our attention, we do invite them to apply for funding.) In sum, we believe we are on the correct course, both with regard to the selection of grantees (some of which we funded prior to the adoption of the current strategy, although most of which emerged through the Request for Concepts process in 2019) and the early results they are producing. That said, just as we balance strategy discipline with emerging critical needs, in this context we balance our commitment to building long-term, deep relationships with core partners with the need to reassess the degree of grantees’ alignment with our strategy and the need to bring on new partners. For example, in a few cases the U.S. portfolio this year includes transition grants to organizations whose strategy fit isn’t as highly aligned as we need it to be. In addition, this year the U.S. portfolio team is recommending the addition of a new grantee that has been able to achieve some impressive outcomes in the areas of base building and civic engagement—two important elements of our protections goal.In “The Strategy at Work” section of this report, we detail the advances that specific grantees are making in each priority geographic region. Rolling up these outcomes, we have been able to identify the following areas of impact. Increased SafetyGOAL 1n Documentation of hate violence. In the international regions where Arcus works, the Foundation supports a significant number of grantees in documenting incidents of hate violence and then using this data to a) advocate with public officials to prosecute these cases, b) intro-duce evidence in litigation, and c) present evidence of mistreatment and impunity by criminal justice officials. Some grantees are working closely with public officials to develop protocols for investigating incidents of hate violence. One grantee in Africa developed an app that research that updates our knowledge of context, threats,  and assets and identifies potential grantee partners; and  2) ongoing discussions with grantees, currently via video  meetings but normally through site visits and conferences.  In addition, meetings with funder colleagues and our involvement in the Global Philanthropy Project and Funders for LGBTQ Issues help us remain current.In a few instances, we have needed to question our original assumptions or assess progress in specific areas of work to ensure that we are indeed focused on the most pressing issues facing the communities we center. The following are two key examples of this reconsideration:n In the United States, re-examining whether we are adequately supporting efforts to advance the safety of LGBTQ people. Arcus began to implement its strategy in this goal area with a focus on improving anti-LGBTQ violence data gathering and reporting, while also  supporting a small number of community-generated safety initiatives. We learned through consultation and through a partnership with the National Coalition of  Anti-Violence Projects, a grantee, that while accurate  data is important, it is not central to keeping people and  communities safe—especially when the main perpetrators  of violence include those same public officials who are charged with addressing incidents of violence. As a result, Program Officer Glo Ross conducted an extensive research and consultation process on how grantees and other partners are addressing safety. This recently completed research will be the basis on which the U.S. portfolio team builds out stronger efforts to fund new approaches to safety and adjusts our current goal-level indicators to measure change in this area. Those changes are currently in process and will be completed early in 2022.n In East Africa, assessing whether faith-related efforts are advancing acceptance and inclusion. Faith has been an essential aspect of Arcus’ Social Justice Program over the last 15 years, though not outside the United States until 2013. In the countries we fund in Africa, we have supported the work of pro-LGBTQ faith leaders and faith communities to train other clergy in the theological underpinnings of LGBTQ acceptance and how to best support their LGBTQ parishioners, to advocate publicly against hate violence, and to work with public authorities to improve their treatment of LGBTQ people. While we are seeing some positive outcomes from these efforts (e.g., the growth of accepting clergy and faith communities and a decrease in hate violence in one region where a minister spoke out on the radio), it is still unclear whether these in-SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 20215PAGEn Strategic litigation. Continuing a long successful strategy for policy change in the United States, Arcus is contribut-ing to the building and strengthening of this sector of the movement in Africa, Central America, Mexico, and the  Caribbean, including the establishment of one region- wide litigation network in Central America and Mexico.  Notable outcomes to date include a positive ruling on decriminalization in Botswana in a case supported by  an Arcus grantee; accountability by governments in  Honduras and El Salvador for murders of trans women; and a positive ruling on decriminalization in Jamaica.n Base building and new movement capacities. The growth of movement strength and capacity is a necessary  precursor for sowing the seeds of victories down the line. In Africa, the continent-wide LGBTQ coalition increased its membership by 85 percent. Arcus’ support helped create the aforementioned litigation network in Mexico and Central America and the network of organizations assisting migrants in Mexico. Arcus is also the first  significant funder of a national LGBTQ advocacy coalition in Mexico. In the United States, grantees expanded their bases of supporters and mobilized them to vote, resulting in the defeat of two anti-immigrant sheriffs in Georgia  and increased LGBTQ Latinx turnout in Arizona, North  Carolina, and Florida. In the Central Valley of California, Arcus grantees are building a growing base of young  Latinx LGBTQ activists and leaders in one of the most  conservative regions of the state. In Florida, an Arcus grantee established the Black LGBTQ Leaders Network, the first network of its kind in the state.Increased Acceptance and InclusionGOAL 3n Promoting faith-based work. In Africa, a growing number of clergy are being trained on LGBTQ issues by Arcus faith grantees, resulting in more clergy speaking up in public, including on radio broadcasts. In one region in Kenya, after a faith leader spoke up against anti-LGBTQ violence, incidents in that area decreased.n Engaging with the media. Media advocacy in Mexico by an Arcus grantee resulted in the accurate and objective reporting on the community of muxe people—Indigenous gender variant people and trans women—living in a region of the country.enables LGBTQ people to report incidents of violence without having to contact public authorities.n Migrants’ and asylum seekers’ rights. Arcus grantees are supporting LGBTQ migrants and asylum seekers in a refugee camp in Kenya, an ICE detention center in the U.S. South, and along migration routes in Mexico. In Kenya, a grantee forged a partnership with the U.N. High Commis-sioner for Refugees to provide safety and legal rights  training for those in the camp. In the United States,  grantees are slowly but surely successfully gaining  the release of trans detainees from ICE custody while advocating with the Biden administration for an end  to trans detention. In Mexico, Arcus helped a grantee create the first network of 20 organizations working  with LGBTQ migrants throughout the country.n Pandemic-related interventions. An Arcus grantee secured the released of more than 20 gay men arrested  in Uganda for allegedly violating COVID-19 restrictions.  The court awarded compensation to the men for their mistreatment while in custody. In the United States,  Arcus grantees across the southern tier provided funding, food, shelter, and other mutual aid assistance to  community members.Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2n Advocacy for pro-LGBTQ policies. Advocacy by  Arcus grantees contributed to the following policy  advancements: a ban on conversion therapies in Mexico City and in Tallahassee and Jacksonville, Florida; passage of a comprehensive hate crimes bill in Georgia; and  passage of nondiscrimination ordinances in Mesa,  Arizona, and in seven localities in Georgia.n Advocacy in opposition to anti-LGBTQ policies. Arcus grantees contributed to the defeat of all religious refusal policy proposals at the state and local levels in Georgia, Florida, and New Mexico. In Uganda, our grantee is  working to prevent the enactment of a law that would increase criminalization of LGBTQ people.n Correcting gender markers on ID documents. Across all regions, Arcus grantees have been successful in  advocating for changes to policies and procedures to  enable correction of gender markers on identification  documents. Grantees are working at the administrative, legislative, and judicial levels on these issues; for example,  a grantee in New Mexico is involved in a successful  collaboration with the department of motor vehicles.Return to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 20216PAGEwere conducted with LGBTQ people, the following challeng-es were brought on or exacerbated by the pandemic: 1) job loss leading to food and shelter insecurity, 2) disruptions in accessing health care, especially ongoing HIV medications and gender-affirming care, 3) elevated risk of domestic and family violence, 4) social isolation, and 5) scapegoating, discrimination, and the abuse of state power. In addition,  the LGBTQ organizations that serve these communities were undergoing crises of sustainability as a result of funding cuts, lockdowns, and increased demand for service delivery.In addition, lockdowns in Arcus focal countries resulted in stalled progress on key decriminalization litigation cases— all involving efforts by Arcus grantees—in Kenya, Botswana, and the eastern Caribbean as courts struggled to function.  In addition, an antidiscrimination bill scheduled to be  introduced in the Honduran Congress was delayed.Grantee Responses to the PandemicIncreased SafetyGOAL 1n Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexuals of Botswana (LEGABIBO) joined the National NGO COVID-19 Technical Working Group to monitor the government’s response to COVID-19 and ensure inclusion of marginalized groups.n In Uganda, the Human Rights Awareness and  Protection Forum filed successful litigation to win  the release of 20 LGBTQ people arrested for violating COVID-19 social distancing mandates. All of the detained individuals were subjected to harassment and some to violence while in detention, and lockdowns delayed  legal proceedings.n The Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya organized a tele-counseling program to address the mental health and wellbeing of LGBTQ people in the context of the pandemic.n In Mexico, muxe communities supported by grantee  Mexfam distributed packages of food from the local  government (of Juchitan) to more than 130 muxe  (Indigenous gender variant and trans women).n In the Caribbean, the Eastern Caribbean Alliance  for Diversity and Equality (ECADE) raised $5,700  through crowdsourcing and distributed it for COVID-19- related support.In March 2020, everything changed. Our day-to-day work lives, our ability to travel to meet with grantees and to network with colleagues, and our understanding of our own sense of safety and risk were upended. Yet in some ways, events unfolded in a predictable manner: those most pushed to the margins were at greater risk for illness and death and for continued mistreatment by officials under the guise of “safeguarding public health and safety.” Protective equip-ment and access to quality health care remained out of reach of those to whom these protections have always been out of reach. These disparities persist to this day as the rollout of vaccines across the globe has yet to reach great numbers of people living in the Global South.The pandemic greatly impacted the ongoing work of Arcus grantees, forcing many to pivot to new ways of working  and supporting their communities. Because in-person fundraising was now impossible, the Social Justice Program developed our Grantee Technical Assistance Initiative to  help build online fundraising capacity. International RegionsIn all of the Social Justice Program’s international regions, the dire subsistence needs of LGBTQ people necessitated our grantees’ engagement in humanitarian direct-service delivery programs, often without proper training or funding. A report from our colleagues at the Global Philanthropy Project1 found that, amid an overwhelming commitment of global humanitarian resources to COVID-19 relief, essentially none were targeted to LGBTQ people as a population in need of support. Therefore, the burden fell on existing LGBTQ organizations to provide food, shelter, and other basic needs, requiring the diversion of critically needed funds used to advance human rights. In light of this diversion, the Social Justice Program’s international team allowed grantees more flexibility in the expenditure of their Arcus grant dollars, although it did not award emergency response dollars.Additional research conducted by OutRight Action  International2 found that in 38 countries where interviews A Year Like No Other:  The Impact of the Pandemic1 “Where Are the Global Covid-19 Resources for LGBTQ Communities?” https://globalphilanthropyproject.org/2020/09/01/covidreport-sept2020/2 “Vulnerability Amplified: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on LGBTIQ People” https://outrightinternational.org/content/vulnerability-amplified-im-pact-covid-19-pandemic-LGBTQq-peopleReturn to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 20217PAGEn The Contigo Fund took a lead role in the formation of the Central Florida LGBTQ+ Mutual Aid Network and Relief Fund in March 2020, capitalizing on Contigo’s network of key stakeholders and coalition of grantees. This network raised more than $66,000 in grassroots donations,  distributed to more than 600 LGBTQ+ individuals. n The Solutions Not Punishment Collaborative (SNaPCo) raised over $20,000 in donations to support sex workers and other Black trans and queer folks in Atlanta during the pandemic.n The Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico moved all of its support groups to a virtual format, and while some of its participants lost access to the groups because of this shift, other members (such as those living in rural areas of New Mexico) gained increased access to the orga-nization’s programs and resources. Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2n Southerners on New Ground (SONG) supported rural  southern LGBTQ organizing in areas hard hit by COVID-19. In Columbus, Georgia, SONG connected members through statewide calls to center the pandemic and mutual-aid efforts within a larger framework of Black liberation  and power building.n Forward Together shifted its voter engagement and  Census outreach to phone, digital, and texting platforms to reach communities safely.n The National LGBTQ Task Force moved its national Queer the Census program fully online. The program  was so successful that its director was tapped by the  incoming Biden administration to run outreach efforts  at the Census Bureau.The success of Equality Florida in quickly pivoting its fund-raising activities online led the Arcus Social Justice Program to develop our own online fundraising capacity-building initiative. Equality Florida implemented new sustainable fundraising strategies aimed at smaller dollar donors.  The organization brought on a digital strategist and hired  a direct-mail firm to begin aggressively cultivating small  donors and monthly donors through email, social media, digital advertising, and direct mail. These investments  increased its digital fundraising by 400% in 2020.Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2n The U.N. independent expert on sexual orientation  and gender identity drafted the ASPIRE guidelines  on “COVID-19 response free from violence and  discrimination” based on SOGI. n In the Caribbean, Parliamentarians for Global Action  organized a regional online consultation with members  of Parliament in partnership with an MP in St. Lucia  and the U.N. Development Program regarding COVID-19  disparities relative to LGBTQ communities, offering  concrete recommendations.n OutRight Action International launched an LGBT- specific emergency assistance fund and related fundrais-ing campaign, resulting in 125 small grants totaling $1 million to organizations in 63 countries (as of May 2021).U.S. Southern TierAs with international grantees, U.S.-based grantees shifted their focus to community survival, developing mutual-aid programs and moving their organizing and community- building activities online. These efforts were tied to an  analysis of structural inequities and a commitment to strengthen community support networks and power. Although Arcus did not award emergency response funding, U.S. grantees, many of which already receive multiyear general operating support, were provided flexibility to use funds to respond to emerging needs. Some grantees—the Campaign for Southern Equality, Astraea, Third Wave, and Borealis—did create their own emergency grantmaking funds.Grantee Responses to the PandemicIncreased SafetyGOAL 1n The Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement  developed a mutual-aid response within its existing organizing activities and long-term vision to grow “people power.” The group raised $20,000 to assist members of  its base to pay rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, and other expenses. n Equality Arizona connected more than 10,000 Arizonans to a statewide mutual-aid network to meet needs during the pandemic and provided personal protective equip-ment to three southern Arizona hospitals during the first wave of the virus. Return to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 20218PAGEof LGBTQ human rights. However, AMLO’s presidential bid in 2018 relied on a coalition that included a conservative evangelical party, and he believes in referenda, as opposed to legislative processes, as a means to recognize LGBTQ human rights. Also troubling is that, as president, he’s taken measures that demonstrate a distrust of civil society (e.g., he cut federal funding for NGOs on the belief that government should help people directly) and was criticized for weaken-ing democracy and the rule of law by increasing the role of the military in the economy. Grantees have also informed us that there are women in the current government who define themselves as “feminists” but do not recognize transgender women as women, which makes it difficult to advocate at the federal level for trans legal protections. As a result, many  advances in LGBTQ human rights in Mexico, including  federal recognition of same-sex marriage and gender-identity protections, have come through the courts.The social environment is mixed. Compared to other regions of the world, LGBTQ Mexicans can freely form LGBTQ organi-zations, express themselves in the media (which features  the most respectful reporting on LGBTQ people among our focus countries, according to the Arcus baseline media scan), and enter into direct dialogue with public authorities up to the highest level. In one opinion poll reported by the Williams Institute in 2021, 83% of respondents agreed that the government should enact antidiscrimination protections for trans people. However, levels of violence and discrimina-tion are extremely high across all populations, especially  impacting LGBTQ people. SOGI-motivated murders are among  the highest in the world (459 LGBTQ murders documented  in the last five years), and often lack proper government investigation. (A federal statistics agency quoted by the U.S. State Department estimated that, in 2020, 94% of all crimes in Mexico, including those targeting LGBTQ people, were  either unreported or not investigated.) A 2019 poll by the country’s National Human Rights Commission found that 6 of every 10 LGBTQ people reported experiencing discrim-ination in the past 12 months and more than half reported incidents of hate speech and physical aggression. The Catholic Church is very influential (over 80% of Mexicans  are Catholic) with a mixed record on LGBTQ issues. While there has been some dialogue by the Church with LGBTQ people, Church officials still make anti-LGBTQ statements.  In July 2020, the National Human Rights Commission  Arcus’ Work in MexicoMexico is the largest (128 million people) of the Foundation’s 11 focus countries outside the United States and the only one  where the government is not openly hostile to LGBTQ people.2020 Social Justice Grantee Partners Based in MexicoPolitical EnvironmentPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (often known by  his initials AMLO) and his governing party, Morena, are  generally seen as progressive on LGBTQ issues; in June 2021, two trans women from his party were elected to Congress, a first in Mexico. AMLO speaks about equality for all, includ-ing marginalized groups, among which are LGBTQ people. He marked the International Day Against Homo-Bi-Trans-Phobias, and his party has considered taking legislative action to outlaw conversion therapy (a measure that was adopted in Mexico City in July 2020), reduce hate crimes,  and recognize the human rights of LGBTQ people.

A growing number of Mexican states have enacted policy protections that include LGBTQ people. However, the country’s federal system is de-centralized, so nationwide change takes time and resources. Arcus contributes to increased safety and legal protections  at the federal level by investing in the development of the  Mexican LGBTTTI+ Coalition, a broad coalition of diverse groups from across Mexico that have an ambitious policy agenda, prioritizing marginalized groups and particularly trans women. Arcus was the first large donor to the coalition. A likely long-term outcome of this effort is a stronger nation-ally organized LGBTQ base, representing the community’s views to government and society at large, with periodic  reviews of federal government policies on LGBTQ human rights and a check on political parties’ related platforms. In the area of safety, support to Letra S funds documentation of hate crimes and advocacy among prosecutors and govern-ment human rights commissions against impunity. This work occurs within a multi-organization network, SinViolencia, which documents hate crimes in nine countries, including El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, in addition to Mexico. The long-term potential for this network is also to document discrimination in employment, health, and education, and to advocate for policy remedies.Another opportunity is the investment in a developing trans movement, toward an eventual national organization of trans people (currently there is no national platform for trans groups to come together and adopt national joint strategies). Our support responds to the critical needs of trans people, primarily regarding their safety, as they are the targets of much of the anti-LGBTQ violence and discrimination.  (Forty-three murders of trans women, with an average age  of 30, were documented in 2020 by grantee Letra S). The primary intermediary for regranting in Mexico, the feminist group Fondo Semillas, is committed to trans inclusivity  and to funding trans groups. Our grant to Fondo  Semillas is coordinated with Wellspring as a funding partner, in terms of purpose, amount, and duration.Many Mexican activists participate in regional networks and organizations, often as leaders. Among those are groups that Arcus already supports, including the regional membership group ILGA-LAC; SinViolencia network, documenting hate crimes; the Latin American Litigation Network; Corpora en Libertad Network, supporting LGBTQ people in detention; as well as regional and international advocacy efforts, such as condemned the Roman Catholic diocese of Mexicali for inciting homophobia by calling for anti-LGBTQ protests and, in March  2020, the Mexican LGBTTTI+ Coalition repudiated the Bishop of Cuernavaca’s statement that COVID-19 is a punishment from God for defending LGBTQ people’s and women’s rights.Arcus’ Funding ApproachBecause few U.S. foundations and other donors support LGBTQ work in Mexico, Arcus helps to fill a gap in funding. This gap is more serious in comparison to the other focus countries in Central America or Africa where we fund. While the funding we provide is significant for our grantees, there are inherent risks when we are the sole institutional donor  to an organization or project, most important among them  is the risk to an organization’s financial sustainability.  Fortunately, colleagues at Wellspring have been able to  co-fund several groups with us. The LGBTQ movement in Mexico is fragmented, with  many organizations staffed by volunteers and with very limited resources. Our funding supports a large number of groups by and for those pushed to the margins, including trans people (via intermediaries) and various trans leaders (via a grant to the Mexican LGBTTTI+ Coalition); muxe in Oaxaca (Indigenous gender variant and trans women, our first grant focused on Indigenous people outside the United States, via a grant to Mexfam; intersex people (via Astraea’s Intersex Fund); refugees and migrants (via grants to Fundación Arcoíris and Human Rights Watch); lesbian and bisexual women (via  Fondo Semillas as an intermediary and Las Reinas Chulas, which is focused on bisexual women); and LGBTQ people in detention (via a grant to COMCAVIS TRANS in El Salvador,  with a partner group in Mexico, Almas Cautivas).Grantees in Mexico are pursuing great opportunities for change, especially through their ability to work with govern-ment officials at all levels and in all branches. There is also support from the courts at both the federal and state levels, which have ruled favorably in individual and strategic cases (the Supreme Court of Mexico even accepted an award from the national Mexican LGBTTTI+ Coalition in 2019, in recogni-tion of its judgments). Arcus currently supports three groups that conduct litigation in cases that have the potential for strategic legal impact: Amicus DH and GIRE (Grupo de  Informacíon en Reproduccíon Elegida), both focused on trans people, and a strategic litigation network in Latin America that includes Mexico (grantee: Colombia Diversa). There is a strong government-appointed National Commission  SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202110PAGEin cases of violence based on gender identity. Mexfam’s muxe conference drew about 150 participants in Oaxaca. Letra S conducted additional trainings with 36 prosecu-tors and 44 lawyers from across Mexico and the Central American region, and Fondo Semillas’ subgrantee  LEDESER conducted the “Seminar on Gender and Sexual Diversity” with the government of Michoacán State,  training judges and legal operators of the Civil Registry about LBT women and specifically trans human rights. Advocacy with health and municipal authorities by Fondo Semillas’ subgrantee Colectivo Feminista Cihuatlahtolli enabled trans sex workers to gain increased access to health services in Veracruz. Fondos Semillas’ subgrantee Mujeres de UDJ was able to secure the release of a lesbian in Jalisco State from a con-version therapy center where she was being held against her will. n Community-defined safety initiatives. Fundación  Arcoíris is the lead organization for the National Network to Support LGBT Migrants and Refugees in Mexico consist-ing of 20 LGBT groups in 17 of the 32 states. The network created a map of migration routes with services available  to migrants and refugees; trained 302 people from mem-ber organizations and other institutions, including  shelters, in how to assist LGBT migrants; and provided direct humanitarian assistance.  Amicus DH is developing a website (identitrans.org) that will contain guides for each Mexican state and for Mexi-can citizens living abroad on how trans people can change their names and genders on identity documents. To date, the first guide has been finalized. Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2n Policy advocacy. Mexico City’s legislature adopted a ban on conversion therapy, relying in part on the U.N. SOGI Expert’s related report, among other types of input. Amicus DH’s assistance and advocacy has enabled trans people under 18 to change their names and gender markers on their birth certificates in the State of Jalisco. Synergía successfully advocated in three states for admin-istrative procedures for the change of gender markers for trans individuals, either by administrative decision (Nue-vo Leon) or by legislative provision (Jalisco and Sonora).n Impact litigation. Colombia Diversa and Promsex have created an LGBT litigation network that held its first the Organization of American States and the United Nations, where Mexico plays a lead role in supporting the recognition of LGBTQ human rights.Finally, with regard to LGBTQ migrants and refugees, our funding in Mexico offers us the opportunity to support this marginalized population on both sides of the southern U.S. border and to contribute to grantees’ sharing of information and strategic thinking. Mexico has a unique place in this context, as a source (Mexican migrants and refugees to the United States), a destination (many Central American and other migrants and refugees who enter Mexico on their way to the United States eventually stay in Mexico; over 40,000 Hondurans applied for asylum in Mexico in the first five months of 2021), and a way station.Early Areas of ImpactIncreased SafetyGOAL 1n Grantees documenting and addressing violence and discrimination. Letra S documented 79 murders of LGBTQ people committed during 2020, with over half of them trans women. One factor in this number, which is about one-third lower than the year before, is likely pandemic-related confinement. Letra S held 18 meetings with criminal justice officials that led to follow-up in several cases and the creation of a working group with the General Prosecutor’s Office to develop a special protocol to investigate crimes against LGBTQ people. In one case, advocacy by SynergÍa led to a proper investigation of the murder of a trans activist in Guanajuato. COMCAVIS TRANS, partnering with Almas Cautivas, pub-lished three reports in 2020 on trans women in detention, the implications of the pandemic on LGBTQ people in detention, and the promotion of the rights of trans women in Latin America. These reports were submitted for a con-sultative opinion of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on LGBTQ people in detention. n Protecting, empowering, advocating for those most vulnerable. In Oaxaca State, Mexfam conducted a dia-logue with and virtual training of 50 officials who have responsibilities in the administration of justice and social inclusion (including the general director of the Civil Reg-istry and the State Human Rights Commission) regarding the safety, gender-identity recognition, and other human rights of muxe (Indigenous gender variant and trans women). In addition, after a muxe woman was arbitrarily detained, Mexfam successfully advocated for the devel-opment of an internal protocol on emergency responses SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202111PAGE ARIZONA• Equality Arizona Foundation• The Outlaw Project• Trans Queer Pueblo• Borealis Philanthropy for    Transforming Movements Fund* *In 2021, this fund changed its name to    Emerging LGBTQ Leaders of Color Fund.ARIZONAthe 2010 passage of SB1070, an anti-immigrant law that made it illegal to fail to carry immigration papers, barred people from hiring or knowingly transporting unauthorized immigrants, and allowed police to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally, among other provisions.  The law galvanized a generation of Latinos to run for politi-cal office and get politically involved and gave rise to a  spirit of activism among young immigrants. These changes are evident in the growth and development of grassroots organizations in the state run by and for Latinx communities that combine service, advocacy, and organiz-ing. These organizations meet the immediate daily needs of communities while in turn developing a base of constituents who trust them to advocate for local and state policy pro-tections and to mobilize voters. For example, the executive director of Puente, a Phoenix-based service, advocacy, and organizing hub, won a seat in the Phoenix City Council and is helping lead major policy changes long deemed priorities by this community. He is also a longtime member of Mijente, an organizing and direct-action group that works in Arizona and other states and has been indirectly supported by Arcus through the Transforming Movements Fund (renamed the Emerging LGBTQ Leaders of Color Fund). These groups work intersectionally on many issues, includ-ing LGBTQ rights, which has enabled a reorganized and strengthened Equality Arizona to connect into an existing ecosystem of social justice organizations. And while Arcus does not support election-related campaigning, it is import-ant to note that elections are often opportunities to test and demonstrate the power and influence of communities on the ground. That power is built by the types of organizations Arcus supports—specifically at the local, state, and regional levels—each day, year-round through authentic non-lobbying community engagement and base building.Despite these positive changes, the current LGBTQ policy landscape in the state remains a challenge. The Movement Advancement Project rates Arizona’s overall policy status  as “low,” its sexual orientation policy as “fair,” and its  gender-identity policy as “negative.” Arizona: Early Areas of ImpactArcus’ funding in Arizona is relatively new, most of it begin-ning in 2019. In addition to Equality Arizona and indirect funding of Mijente, we also support Familia, a national organization focused on trans justice, especially with regard to refugees and migrants, and Trans Queer Pueblo.meeting in Bogota, Colombia, in 2019 with 46 participants from 14 Latin American countries, including Mexico. The network published a legal analysis of the binding force of the decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, including its consultative opinion on LGBT human rights of 2017.Increased Acceptance and InclusionGOAL 3n Fair media coverage. As a result of efforts by Mexfam, the strengths of and challenges to muxe women in Mexico were reported in 15 local and national media reports. The work of Mexfam, Almas Cautivas (a partner of COMCAVIS TRANS), the Mexican LGBTTTI+ Coalition, and Letra S were accurately reported in the media.Our Work in Arizona and GeorgiaArizona: Context2020 U.S. Social Justice Grantee Partners: ArizonaArizona presents the Arcus Foundation with significant opportunities and a legacy of challenges.The racial demographics of Arizona indicate that the state  is soon likely to be one of a growing number of states with  a “new American majority” population, i.e., a majority of residents of color. Currently, Arizona is 50% white, 43% Latino, and 7% Black and Asian. This type of demographic profile was originally identified as one of the attributes the Social Justice Program was considering when we identified the five states in the southern tier where we would focus.  We were also looking for states demonstrating high potential  to become true battlegrounds that could “flip” to a pro- LGBTQ-equality environment through both demographic change and emerging organizing infrastructure. Just a few years later, we see this happening.Ongoing tensions on the state’s border with Mexico have exacerbated a history of explicit racism and nativism among some residents. One encouraging sign was the reaction to SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202112PAGE GEORGIA• Faith in Public Life• Forward Together• Equality Foundation of Georgia• Solutions Not Punishment Collaborative    (SNaPCo)• Proteus Fund for Rights, Faith &   Democracy Collaborative • SPARK Reproductive Justice NOWGEORGIALike Arizona, Georgia is a state in transition, moving in  the 2020 election from deep red to purple. Demographically, it is 60% white, 30% Black or African American, and 10% Latinx and Asian.But also like Arizona, the LGBTQ policy profile is challeng-ing, receiving an overall rating by the Movement Advance-ment Project of “low,” a sexual orientation policy rating of “low,” and a gender-identity policy rating of “negative.”Georgia: Early Areas of ImpactThe ecosystem of Arcus grantees working in Georgia is  anchored by the state equality organization, Georgia Equality. Its work on policy advocacy is supported by Arcus grantees Faith in Public Life, the Georgia Rights, Faith & Democracy Coalition (a grantee of the pooled Rights, Faith & Democracy Collaborative at Proteus), and SPARK Repro-ductive Justice NOW. At the local level in Atlanta is SNaPCo (Solutions Not Punishment Coalition), a grassroots group  by and for trans women of color that focuses on criminal  justice reform. Long-time Arcus grantee SONG is a regional organization that collaborates across social justice issues with grantees in Georgia. Finally, most recently, Forward Together, whose work in New Mexico Arcus has funded for  a number of years, has begun to organize in Georgia.Increased SafetyGOAL 1n Protecting, empowering, and advocating for those most vulnerable. On May 7, 2019, Atlanta Mayor Keisha  Lance Bottoms signed legislation that would close down and repurpose the Atlanta City Detention Center. SNaPCo director Toni-Michelle Williams served on the policy working group for the Reimagine ACDC Taskforce. Included was specific advocacy for the repeal of policies that criminalize trans people in Atlanta, such as arrest for disorderly conduct, solicitation, idling, and loitering. In November 2019, SNaPCo hosted over 80 Black TGNC and queer people to discuss and reimagine the use of ACDC. SONG won a seat at the table on the Atlanta City Council task force to repurpose the city’s jail.Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2n Base building for power and influence. SONG’s ability to mobilize its base in 2020 contributed to the election of two new Georgia county sheriffs who, unlike the incum-bents, committed to ending cooperation with the Immi-gration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. SONG’s work in Georgia was aided by the growth of its base across Increased SafetyGOAL 1n Protecting, empowering, and advocating for those most vulnerable. Trans Queer Pueblo directly supported 49 LGBT migrants to gain their release from detention. Even though its efforts to connect with migrants in deten-tion by regular visitation was disrupted by the pandemic, the organization was still able to make some visits and sustain letter-writing campaigns.n Community-defined safety initiatives. As the pandemic impacted its state, Equality Arizona prioritized the safety both of its constituents and first responders by connecting more than 10,000 Arizonans to a statewide mutual-aid network to meet their needs during the pandemic and by providing PPE to three southern Arizona hospitals during the first wave of COVID-19. Trans Queer Pueblo recruited and trained two volunteer lawyers to support legal-aid work and hosted one name-change clinic. The group also established an infrastruc-ture to reach its base of members to check in on wellbeing and provide support as needed throughout the pandemic.Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2n Base building for power and influence. In order to make the case with elected officials for increased pro-tections, Equality Arizona organized more than 500 community members to participate in over 100 face-to-face dialogues and interviews with elected officials and candidates for public office.n Policy advocacy. Equality Arizona along with ONE Community, a coalition of socially responsible businesses in the state, contributed to the successful enactment of a nondiscrimination ordinance in the city of Mesa.Georgia: Context2020 U.S. Social Justice Grantee Partners: Georgia SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202113PAGE Georgia Equality also helped advocate for the passage of seven local nondiscrimination ordinances, including three outside of metro Atlanta.  The Rights, Faith & Democracy Coalition working in  Georgia defeated three municipal RFRA (i.e., religious refusal) ordinances and raised the total number of cities offering comprehensive nondiscrimination protections (with limited religious exemptions) to 11. The combined efforts of partners and allies statewide, including Faith in Public Life and Georgia Equality, ensured no anti-equality legislation passed in Georgia for the seventh year in a row. the U.S. Southeast, with 1,000 new members and 11 new chapters founded across eight states. Georgia Equality implemented a plan to reach over 450,000 pro-equality voters in the general election and expanded this to a universe of 650,000 voters for the sub-sequent runoff elections. To this end, it built a volunteer base of 500 who put in 110,000 volunteer hours and made over 25,000 phone calls and sent nearly 500,000 text messages. This cohort of 650,000 pro-equality voters will be mobilized by Georgia Equality going forward, which is especially significant as Georgia is becoming increasingly more important in national elections. To aid in this effort, the organization has hired a southern regional field orga-nizer to expand its reach to underserved areas of the state. SPARK focused on expanding its digital organizing campaign and leadership development programs, which resulted in engaging over 700 queer and trans BIPOC and expanding its active membership base by more than 100 members. SPARK also launched its Trans Health Policy  Report, which includes a virtual resource of trans-affirm-ing services across the South, and released an updated zine to amplify member artwork. To bolster queer and trans BIPOC power building in the South, SPARK hosted a series of political education workshops and skill shares and held a zoom townhall, all led by members. As a result of this work, SPARK continued to shift political and  cultural narratives around gender, racial, and reproductive  justice in the South by centering the leadership of young queer and trans BIPOC. More organizations, community  members, and partners have connected with SPARK around its focus on centering queer, trans, and Black liberation within the reproductive-justice movement. n Policy Advocacy. Georgia Equality successfully advo-cated for the passage of a comprehensive hate crimes bill in Georgia. Passage of this legislation has been a goal of a multiracial and interfaith coalition for decades and represents the first time that sexual orientation and gender have been enumerated as protected categories in any Georgia law. While they were not successful in having “gender identity” explicitly named, legal scholars from the Movement Advancement Project, Lambda Legal, and the Human Rights Campaign and from within the Geor-gia Attorney General’s office all agree that the language passed will offer protections for individuals who identify as transgender, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming. Importantly, through this work, Georgia Equality built deeper coalition ties to Georgia NAACP and other groups working for racial justice. Return to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202114PAGEIn the following sections, we examine how grantees have advanced the objectives of the Social Justice strategy in the focal regions, countries, and U.S. states not included in the above in-depth analyses. As part of our overall theory of change, the Social Justice Program funds ecosystems of grantees working in countries and U.S. states and collabo-rating with grantees focused nationally and regionally. A regional map of each ecosystem is shown at the outset of  the following sections.East and Southern Africa:  Kenya, Uganda, Botswana,  Malawi, South AfricaIncreased SafetyGOAL 1n Documenting and addressing violence and discrimi-nation. In Kenya, Transgender Education and Advocacy completed research on public and institutional accep-tance of trans people in the country, finding that 83% of those surveyed had transphobic opinions. This data was shared with the media in an effort to publicize the need for protections for transgender Kenyans. In Uganda, the Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF) documented 253 incidences of anti-LGBTQ human rights violations, with 46 accepted for follow-up investigations by local council authorities and the police. Iranti developed a mobile app for use by LGBTQ people  in East and southern Africa that will enable the group  to document incidents of violence and discrimination  on its own, instead of relying on law enforcement to  gather documentation.n Protecting, empowering, and advocating for those most vulnerable. UHAI, the East Africa intermediary, regranted Arcus funds to organizations that assisted more than 400 refugees fleeing violence and living in refugee camps. Assistance provided included short-term housing,  food, counseling, HIV medication, and advocacy to address other needs. The Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya established a formal partnership with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to provide security trainings  to LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers in Kenya.Strategy Advances in 20202020 Social Justice Grantee Partners:  East and Southern Africa UGANDA• East African    Visual Artists (EAVA)• HRAPF (Human Rights    Awareness and Promotion Forum)• Tranz Network Uganda    (through Donor Advised Fund)• Universal Coalition of    Affirming Africans Uganda    (through Donor Advised Fund) KENYA• Gay and Lesbian Coalition of    Kenya (GALCK)• Initiative for Equality and Non-Discrimination (INEND)• Jinsiangu • National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC) • PEMA Kenya (Persons Marginalized and Aggrieved in Kenya)• Transgender Education and Advocacy (TEA) MALAWI• Malawi Network of Religious Leaders Living with or Personally   Affected by HIV and AIDS (MANERELA+) BOTSWANA• LEGABIBO (Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals of Botswana) ZAMBIA• ZANERELA+ (Zambia Network of Religious Leaders Living    With or Personally Affected by HIV and AIDS) SOUTH AFRICA• Just Detention International South Africa• Triangle Project• Western Cape Provincial Council of Churches EAST AFRICA – REGIONAL• Yvette A.

After a pro-LGBTQ faith minister associated with and trained by the Church World Service, an Arcus grantee, advocated over the  airwaves for an end to anti-LGBTQ violence, incidents  of such violence in his region of Kenya decreased. The grantee conducted faith community sensitization  workshops with 223 Muslim and Christian faith leaders and sponsored a three-day virtual dialogue with 27  women theologians. Similarly, in Malawi, faith leaders trained by grantee MANERELA+ issued statements over the radio and in the pulpit condemning violence, resulting in decreased  violence in one Malawian district. A sheikh, previously  at the forefront of preaching against LGBTQ persons, is now a change agent among “religious champions”  working with MANERELA+. The sheikh reached out to  130 other sheikhs and local leaders. A documentary produced by grantee East Africa Visual Artists, focusing on interviews with religious leaders  and LGBTQ people in Uganda, was completed and screened in an effort to promote inclusion by faith leaders and the public. HRAPF secured the release of 20 LGBTQ people arrested and detained under the cover of pandemic restrictions. The High Court of Uganda awarded damages to these indi-viduals, who were mistreated during their long detention. In Malawi, MANERELA+’s advocacy with local health  ministries enabled LGBTQ communities to more easily access public health facilities.n Community-defined safety initiatives. The Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya implemented an emergency  security response mechanism for its member organizations.Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2n Base building for power and influence. Over the past two years, the membership of Pan Africa ILGA increased by 85%, from 138 member organizations to 256. This  expansion includes growth in southern Africa from 38 to 64 members and in East Africa from 44 to 72 members.n Policy advocacy. In both Kenya and Botswana, grantees are working with, advising, and advocating with govern-ment agencies on a range of issues. Grantees of Astraea’s Intersex Fund are advising the Kenyan Bureau of Statistics on both the inclusion of a third gender in the national census and the addition of “intersex” as an option on birth certificates, as well as on funding gender-affirming surgeries and ending surgeries on intersex children.  In Botswana, LEGABIBO submitted guidelines to the  government on creating inclusive policies that protect trans and gender-diverse communities and on changing gender markers on identification documents.n Strategic litigation. After the Kenyan High Court upheld the constitutionality of the country’s laws criminalizing same-sex activity in 2019, two Arcus grantees—the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya (GALCK), and the Nation-al Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC)  —partnered with Nyanza, Rift Valley, and Western Kenya Network (NYARWEK) to file an appeal with the Court of Appeals. A further appeal to the country’s Supreme Court may be filed and could delay a final decision at least 3 years and as long as 10. A positive ruling on decriminalization in Botswana was appealed by the government. In 2021, the country’s highest court sustained the lower court’s ruling, effectively decrim-inalizing same-sex relations in Botswana. Arcus grantee LEGABIBO, the country’s national LGBTQ organization, engaged in public messaging and advocacy in connection with the case.

Arcus grantee Entre Amigos in El Salvador conducted a mapping of faith organizations and leaders in the country, identifying eight that are inclusive of LGBTQ people. A similar mapping was commissioned by Arcus to assess the situation among pro-LGBTQ faith leaders in the Carib-bean. The information provides a basis for future funding.n Fair and accurate media coverage. Grantees throughout the region reported that their activities and messaging were being reported accurately and fairly by the media. They included COMCAVIS TRANS (El Salvador), Cattra-chas (Honduras), Mexfam and Letra S (Mexico), Human  Rights Watch, and Colombia Diversa Litigation Network (both regional). Arcus conducts detailed media scans every three years  to monitor coverage of LGBTQ issues and communities.U.S. Southern TierGrantees advanced safety for LGBTQ communities through decriminalization campaigns and support for LGBTQ  immigrants and asylum seekers; protections for LGBTQI communities through voter engagement and advocacy efforts; and growing and activating a base of LGBTQ people through grassroots, multiracial, and cross-sector organizing. Increased SafetyGOAL 1n Protecting, empowering, and advocating for those most vulnerable. Black Youth Project 100 and Southern-ers on New Ground led community-based safety initiatives in Durham, North Carolina, leading to the city’s first  Community Safety and Wellness Task Force. The Transgender Law Center represented clients in three immigration cases in the southern tier. One client was Chin, a trans immigrant who had been trafficked and then held in solitary confinement. Chin was released from de-tention and able to return to his family in March 2020. TLC also helped incubate and grow the Black LGBTQ Migrant Project, which freed 10 Black migrants from detention. The National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) provided support and assistance to more than 250 LGBTQ immi-grants and asylum seekers. Notably, NCLR directly  represented more than 35 asylum seekers with a 100% success rate.In Honduras, given the wide discrepancy between the  government’s data on hate violence deaths and data  collected by community groups, Cattrachas is advocating  for a more reliable and accurate system to record hate  crimes against LGBT people.Increased ProtectionsGOAL 2n Policy advocacy. In Honduras, the Human Rights  Secretariat ruled that prohibiting blood donations by LGBT people was discriminatory and recommended that the Department of Health repeal related legal provisions. Cattrachas coordinated a related communications  campaign, including via radio and social media.  Arcus grantee Synergía successfully advocated to allow trans individuals in Honduras to have their ID photos  correspond to their gender identity and expression in  the civil registry process. A collaborative of organizations, including Guyana Trans United, funded by our grantee Astraea, formed a working group that will advocate for expanded gender-identity recognition. In Trinidad & Tobago, Astraea’s subgrantee CAISO developed the LGBTQ Policy Agenda 2.0 to focus on national policy and human rights, with a focus on reach-ing media and public officials.n Strategic litigation. The Organization of American States has emerged as a forum for accountability and justice for LGBTQ people in the region. Its executive human rights arm, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, ruled that Jamaica’s law criminalizing same-sex relations violates the American Convention on Human Rights. A case against the government of Honduras in connection with the murder of Vicky Hernandez in 2009 was heard by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights during the period covered by this report. In June 2021, the ruling  in the case, which was finally decided with a finding against the government, included in its remedies a list of corrective actions to be taken to protect trans people in Honduras. Cattrachas provided legal support to the family of the victim and conducted media advocacy. Grantees SynergÍa and Parliamentarians for Global Action submit-ted amicus briefs. The same court ruled favorably against the government in another case of a trans woman who suffered torture and arbitrary detention, contributing to  a growing body of jurisprudence protecting trans people in the region. Arcus grantee Promsex was involved in  this litigation.

Overall, 99Rootz engaged over 1,300 youth in leadership-development programs—a record number even amid challenging times and the difficulties of  organizing in rural conservative communities. It reached 5,049 young voters during the 2020 primary in the Central Valley. Equality Florida added 17,000 grassroots supporters and recruited, trained, and mobilized 415 volunteers to execute its  most expansive voter mobilization effort to date. The group also  identified 40 leaders comprising the emerging Black LGBTQ Leaders Network that the organization will help support. Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement launched an LGBTQ Latinx digital voter-engagement campaign to digital-ly engage LGBTQ Latinx voters in Arizona, North Carolina, and Florida, reaching almost one million impressions across all platforms and leading to historic Latinx voter turnout. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs added three grassroots organizations into the coalition. United We Dream expanded its membership (field and on-line) to 800,000 and trained over 200 members in outreach and digital organizing strategy. Arcus support contributed to this expansion through a final grant to the organization.n Policy advocacy. In Florida, Faith in Public Life  successfully advocated for conversion therapy bans in Tallahassee and Jacksonville. The organization also  successfully partnered with Florida-based organizations to prevent eight proposed anti-LGBTQ bills from passing in the Florida state legislature.  The Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico worked directly with New Mexico’s motor vehicle division to streamline and improve the process for changing gender markers on drivers’ licenses, leading to new user-friendly forms and efficient processes to correct gender markers. After over a year of interACT’s advocacy efforts and col-laboration with medical students and LGBTQ allies, the Massachusetts Medical Society passed a resolution at its December 2019 meeting in support of safeguarding intersex children’s bodily autonomy by delaying medical interven-tions. This sets a precedent for other institutions to follow suit across other states, including Arcus’ priority regions.Return to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202120PAGEGrantee MapsGrant Data2020 U.S. Social Justice Grantee Partners CENTRAL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA• California Rural Legal Assistance• Power California for 99Rootz program• The Source LGBT+ Center ARIZONA• Equality Arizona Foundation• The Outlaw Project• Trans Queer Pueblo NEW MEXICO• Santa Fe Dreamers Project• Transgender Resource Center of    New Mexico SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST U.S.   (REGIONAL)• Faith in Public Life• Forward Together• NEO Philanthropy for Four Freedoms    Fund’s Border Butterfly Project• Funders for LGBTQ Issues for Out    in the South Fund• Proteus Fund for Rights, Faith and    Democracy Collaborative • SONG (Southerners on New Ground) • Third Wave Fund NATIONAL• Groundswell Fund for Black Trans Fund• Borealis Philanthropy for Fund for    Trans Generations• GSA Network• interACT• Justice Work for LGBTQ+ Women’s    Research and Organizing Initiative • National Center for Lesbian Rights • New York City Gay and Lesbian    Anti-Violence Project• National LGBTQ Task Force • New Venture Fund• Point Source Youth• Public Religion Research Institute • Astraea Foundation for Racial    Justice Fund• Borealis Philanthropy for Transforming    Movements Fund• Transgender Acceptance Index• Transgender Law Center • TLDEF (Transgender Legal Defense    and Education Fund)• True Colors Fund• Urgent Action Fund for Women’s    Human Rights • United We Dream Network NORTH CAROLINA• BYP100• Campaign for Southern Equality• Equality North Carolina Foundation• The Freedom Center for Social Justice• Southern Vision Alliance  GEORGIA• Equality Foundation of Georgia• Solutions Not Punishment    Collaborative (SNaPCo)• SPARK Reproductive Justice NOW FLORIDA• Contigo Fund• Equality Florida • JASMYN (Jacksonville Area Sexual    Minority Youth Network)Return to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportWAMT NDSDMNIAWIILIN OHMIPANYWVDCMDDENJCTMARINHMEVTMOARLAMS AL GASCNCTNKYVAFLNEKSOKTXIDNVUTAZ NMCOWYORCA21PAGESOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 20212020 International Social Justice Grants MEXICO• Amicus • Fundación Arcoíris • Fondo Semillas (grantmaking) • GIRE (Grupo de Informacíon en    Reproduccíon Elegida) • Género, Ética y Saluda (GESS)    for Coalición Mexican LGBTTTI+    (Mexican LGBTTTI+ Coalition)  GUATEMALA• Colectivo Amigos Contra    El Sida (CAS)  EL SALVADOR• Entre Amigos Asociación Salvadoreña    de Derechos Humanos  CARIBBEAN – REGIONAL • Astraea Foundation (grantmaking) MEXICO, CENTRAL AMERICA, CARIBBEAN –   MULTIPLE COUNTRIES• Colombia Diversa for Red de Litigantes    LGBT de las Américas (LGBT Litigants    Network of the Americas)• Hivos (grantmaking) • Human Rights Watch  INTERNATIONAL• Astraea Foundation for International Trans Fund • Columbia University for Human Rights Advocates Program • Global Interfaith Network • United Nations Foundation for Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity   UGANDA• East African Visual Artists    (EAVA)  KENYA• Gay and Lesbian Coalition    of Kenya (GALCK)  MALAWI• Malawi Network of Religious    Leaders Living with or    Personally Affected by HIV    and AIDS (MANERELA+)  ZAMBIA• ZANERELA+ (Zambia Network of Religious Leaders    Living With or Personally Affected by HIV and AIDS) SOUTH AFRICA• Western Cape Provincial Council    of Churches  SOUTHERN AFRICA – REGIONAL• Inclusive & Affirming Ministries  • Iranti • The Other Foundation (grantmaking)  AFRICA – MULTIPLE COUNTRIES• Initiative for Strategic Litigation in Africa (ISLA) • Network of African National Human    Rights Institutions (NANHRI)  • Investigative Reporters and Editors    for Taboom Media HONDURASGUYANAMEXICOTRINIDAD & TOBAGOGUATEMALAEL SALVADORKENYAUGANDAZAMBIA MALAWIBOTSWANASOUTH  AFRICAMulti-year grantTransFaithSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202122PAGE2020 Social Justice  Funding by PortfolioIn the following visuals, multiyear funding is presented  only in the year it was awarded.

These examples point to the need for us to continue to partner with colleague funders to leverage our support (see below).3. The process for conducting future Social Justice evaluations should reflect learnings from our current efforts, includ-ing a concrete timeline for an internal evaluation in 2021 (to cover 2020). Analyze the opportunity of a “mid-term” (four-year) evaluation in 2022 with the inclusion of an external assessment that will cover 2018–21.  This internally conducted evaluation focused on work in 2020 was guided by a set timeline, as recommended.  As stated in the opening section of this report, our “deep-dive” evaluation will be developed in 2023. This comprehensive assessment will include close tracking of indicators to assess progress against baselines, including updated media scans administered by consultants. It will also be conducted with the help of an outside evaluator who will interview a sample of grantees to identify impact and guidance for future years.4. Compare Arcus’ funding to that of other donors and to sector research, such as the Global Resources Report for 2017–18; to specific reports on funding for trans people and LBQ women; and to funding for the U.S. southern region, to understand how Arcus performs against such benchmarks and how we are perceived in relation to  other donors.  The Social Justice team has incorporated regular discus-sions about how Arcus compares to other funders when new sector reports are released. For example, we have discussed reports from the Global Philanthropy Project (GPP) focused on funding for trans and intersex organiza-tions and communities, LBQTI women, and COVID-related needs in the LGBTQ community, and funding provided by embassies for LGBTI issues. A new Global Resources Report is to be completed in 2022 by the GPP and Funders for LGBTQ Issues, to cover 2019–20, which will facilitate further analysis of Arcus’ funding compared to other donors.5. Define our approach to leveraging funding from  other donors.  A sub-strategy memo on this issue is in the last stages of completion by staff following a discussion on leverage earlier this year.Following Up on Our Last ReportIn September 2020, the findings from the first evaluation report for the current Social Justice strategy (covering work in 2018–19) were presented to the Arcus board, along with a copy of the full report. Below are the recommendations included in that report with updates on actions taken:1. Rethink the indicators for the three goals, in light of our learning so far, but delay any changes to the indicators until 2021: Analyze goal 1 in the United States and goals 1 and 3 both in the United States and internationally. Work is underway that will enable staff to make adjust-ments to indicators for goals 1 (safety) and 3 (acceptance/inclusion) in 2022. Specifically, the U.S. program staff will be presenting to the team recommended changes to goal 1 objectives, focusing on better defining the objective and indicator related to community-generated safety initiatives.  With regard to goal 3, U.S. staff are commissioning a  consultant to conduct a scoping project that will better  define our objectives in supporting faith work in the United  States. This project will also identify potential grantees. Similarly, an evaluation project being conducted by a con-sultant assessing faith efforts in East Africa was submitted to the Foundation and will be analyzed by staff along with the scoping research Arcus commissioned on faith work in the Caribbean. Taken together, these projects will sharpen and clarify our objectives on goals 1 and 3, enabling us to identify the most appropriate and effective indicators.2. Apply a degree of flexibility to the Arcus rules and prac-tices, keeping in mind the end goals of our strategy and our values and principles. For instance, under certain conditions in the International portfolio, Arcus should be able to support smaller groups of people pushed to the margins with more than the maximum one-third of their annual budget. This recommendation remains valid, especially in 2020 when, across all regions, we provided higher levels of support to some grantees and, in some cases, lengthened grant periods. We have supported trans groups in Kenya and Uganda and LGBT groups in Mexico (e.g., Mexfam  in its support of muxe women and the Mexican LGBTTTI+ Coalition) above one-third of their annual budgets  when no other donor had yet come forward. Here the Learnings, Challenges, and OpportunitiesReturn to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202127PAGEevidence of the power and influence built when this work is consistently funded over at least a decade. Of course, these groups must be resourced year-in and year-out to do the long-game community engagement needed to win policy campaigns and generational shifts.3. A portfolio that intentionally increases the number  of grantees based at the state and local levels (often smaller in size with higher potential impact) calls for more flexible requirements related to proposals, reports, and other obligations expected of organizations with greater capacity.This approach also requires a more strategic definition of “risk.” Indeed, it would be risky for Arcus to avoid funding small and medium-sized groups, because that would signal that we are not resourcing communities in our geographic priority areas or aligning our grants with our strategy. As a whole, the Social Justice Program strives for a balanced risk portfolio, with many long-time partners in the lower risk  category and newer partners (especially those working in more challenging contexts) in medium- or high-risk categories.Challenges1. Pandemic-related travel restrictions posed obstacles.Across all our priority regions, travel restrictions resulted in our inability to identify new grantee prospects in the way we have done in the past through in-person meetings. This is especially true in some of our newer countries (e.g., Trinidad & Tobago, Guyana) and U.S. states (e.g., North Carolina). These restrictions were in place for 10 months in 2020 and are continuing throughout 2021, with an uncertain outlook for 2022.2. Anti-LGBTQ opponents have a new narrative. Recent publications by conservative movements mapping LGBTQ funding and highlighting Arcus in particular have been forwarded to us by grantees. These publications position Arcus at the top of a so-called “gender ideology movement” that is working to “replace sex with gender,” to the detriment of women’s rights and in favor of transgender people. In some of these publications, Arcus’ grants data is very precise, relying on the transparency of our website, but mischaracterizing some of our funding as “lobbying.” These developments point to our need to resource efforts that  combat this opposition and its perpetuation of inaccurate  information about LGBTQ funding as well as movement goals and strategies. This opposition reinforces our commit-ment to continue to strengthen trans organizations and  allied groups, since trans communities are the specific  targets of these opponents.Learnings1. Intermediaries and pooled funds continue to enable us to reach emerging organizing by the communities  we center.Intermediary organizations and pooled funds in Arcus’  United States and international portfolios provide grants (usually less than $20,000 per year) to smaller and emerging groups. These groups, especially in the Global South, often  lack legal status but are nevertheless aligned with our strategy because they are led by and exist for the benefit of people pushed to the margins, such as refugee organizations in  Kenya (funded by UHAI), trans groups in all regions (funded by the Fund for Trans Generations, Third Wave, Ground-swell, and the International Trans Fund), and women-led groups in the Caribbean (funded by Astraea). Many of these emerging organizations are focused on community safety (goal 1) and organizing/base building (goal 2). 2. Base building is a necessary condition for LGBTQ  protections and policy.Arcus grantmaking has long prioritized LGBTQ cross-move-ment organizing led by and for LGBTQ people most pushed to the margins. In the United States, our current strategy focuses on the southern tier because we believe that invest-ing in these communities is key to sustainable social change and has potential “spillover” impact to other regions of the country. Through our support of organizations working to increase protections (goal 2), we support cross-movement collaboration and work that increases the political power of constituencies to influence change through civic engagement and participation in advocacy. Simply said: winning and sustaining protections and policies has the greatest potential for success when motivated bases of people act to make it so. This is especially true in the communities our grantees repre-sent, since they often do not have the financial resources to influence change through expert advocacy or political cam-paign donations. However, when organized, they have the growing numbers to show their power by deciding elections and advocating for change. The successes of our grantees in both Georgia and Arizona are prime examples of why we continue to invest in a strategy that measures success, in part, by tracking base building indicators.The five states in which we focus our support were original-ly identified because—among other things—they showed a high potential to become true battlegrounds that could “flip” through demographic change and emerging organizing infrastructure. Just a few years later, we see this happening in places like Arizona and Georgia. This was the result of many years of community organizing and provides further SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202128PAGEcontrary bill, introduced by former Congresswoman Sandra Moran, an out lesbian, seeking to address hate crimes and anti-LGBT discrimination, stalled in Congress.Also in Guatemala, two transgender women and one gay man were murdered in separate attacks. Among them were Andrea Gonzales and Ceci Caricia Ixpata, leaders of our  subgrantee OTRANS Queens of the Night. Both had sought help from the attorney general’s office in connection with threats they had received. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and foreign embassies, which included  the United States, called for proper investigations. In Honduras, a journalist who publicly condemned  anti-LGBTQ violence was killed. Guyanese drag artist Singh was murdered in April 2021 in his home in Trinidad &  Tobago, a crime that shocked people across Caribbean LGBTQ communities.5. A major human rights funding colleague faces an  uncertain direction.Open Society Foundations has been a major donor for LGBT issues internationally (ranked No. 5 by dollar amount during 2017–18, with almost $17 million in grants). Recently, OSF initiated a major strategic planning and restructuring process.  At this point, it is not clear to what extent LGBTQ issues will be included in OSF’s new programmatic and staffing plan.6. The intense need for healing trauma and continued mutual aid is only growing among grantees.It is rare to be in conversation with a grantee and not hear about the urgent need for healing and mutual aid in re-sponse to the question “what are your biggest challenges at the moment?” As a strategic grantmaker, Arcus will need to continue balancing this reality with our commitment to re-maining on strategy, understanding that healing and mutual aid have become critical areas of many of our grantees’ work and are factors that impact their ability to create a thriving base of people from which to organize and advocate.Opportunities1. Impact litigation expands protections in the  Global South.While decriminalization appeals stalled in Kenya as a result of the pandemic, litigation did move forward in the Carib-bean, with grantee ECADE initiating in 2020 a petition to repeal anti-gay criminal laws in Barbados and supporting security and communications for similar petitions filed by other groups in St. Vincent and Dominica. In 2021, ECADE filed additional petitions in Antigua and Barbuda, as well as Similarly, in the United States, we are seeing the growth  of anti-trans policy measures introduced as one battle in a  larger culture war designed to lure voters “in the middle” toward a more conservative agenda. Arcus grantees in  the United States and in the Global South are working to curtail these measures through advocacy, media work, and strategic litigation.3. Obstacles persist to advancing racial justice in the United States.Multiple grantees noted that, while there are certainly huge wins to celebrate in 2020, the fact remains that approximately  half of the country supported white supremacist policies  and leadership. While this was not a complete surprise,  it is certainly a more visible and hostile terrain that LGBTQ groups will need to continue navigating. This landscape especially impacts groups working at the local level in  states with swaths of deeply conservative areas that are experiencing visible backlash from white supremacists  and religious conservatives. 4. We continue to support movements in countries with high levels of violence and few protections.In Uganda, although a newly introduced Sexual Offences  Bill was not adopted, media coverage of the bill sent a  negative message to the public, including to law enforcement.  Arbitrary arrests continued in Uganda, with 42 LGBT  people from the Happy Family Shelter arrested in June 2021. Fortunately, the Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum, our grantee, mobilized legal assistance immediately and successfully obtained the release of those arrested, even winning compensation for the victims in certain cases. Still, group arrests in Uganda have intensified, with three such events over the past year in which law enforcement used COVID-19 prevention measures as a rationale to arrest people they perceived as LGBTQ. This oppressive context forces progressive movements to focus on the existing situation in which LGBTQ people are subject to criminal penalties and slows efforts to gradually move forward toward repealing the criminalization law and then incrementally adopting and implementing antidiscrimination provisions—a legislative trajectory we have also seen in the case of South Africa.In Guatemala, a pending “Life and Family Protection Bill” described “sexual diversity” as “incompatible with the biological and genetic aspects of human beings” and defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The bill included wording that “freedom of conscience and expression” protects people from being “obliged to accept non-hetero-sexual conduct or practices as normal,” a provision that could be used to justify discriminatory denial of services. A SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 202129PAGEtrans people. The work will not be easy, but there is a signif-icant shift in the possibilities, and groups will need steady and increased support to take advantage of opportunities.The Equality Act has passed the U.S. House of Representa-tives and is stalled in the Senate, with an uphill battle ahead. Groups working on a state and federal strategy include for the first time leaders such as Imani Rupert-Gordon of the National Center for Lesbian Rights and Andy Marra of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, both Arcus grantees. The increase in leaders who are queer women of color at this type of federal policy table is itself a key indicator of the kind of movement advancement Arcus has centered for many years.It is important for Arcus as a funder to recognize that, as  administrations change, our grantmaking approach must take into account whether and how grantees have shifted their long-game and short-term approaches accordingly.3. State equality group grantees working in coalition across movements can increase their potential for success.Equality North Carolina worked closely with Mijente, an organization that mobilizes Latinx communities, on voter turnout and poll protection, leading to some local electoral successes. Equality North Carolina attributes these wins to its ability to engage in multiracial, multi-issue coalition work that began long before the election. The organization is ap-plying learnings from Latinx organizing partners to increase its own “cultural organizing” and to better “queer the vote” in advance of the next election cycle.in St. Kitts and Nevis, with support from the University of the West Indies, our grantee SynergÍa, and others. While it will take several years to obtain final judgments, some of these petitions have the potential to succeed based on favorable precedent set in Belize and Trinidad & Tobago and on an In-ter-American Commission on Human Rights decision against Jamaica’s anti-gay criminal law.A recent important decision was issued by the Inter-Ameri-can Court of Human Rights against Honduras in the case of a trans woman, Vicky Hernández, murdered in 2009. In its decision, the court set a precise standard for the protection of trans women against violence and for larger measures that included legal recognition of gender identity. Grant-ees—including Cattrachas, SynergÍa, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights—contributed to this outcome.2. New opportunities emerge from a new U.S. administration.International PortfolioIn its earliest days, the Biden administration made public its support for the human rights of LGBTQ people abroad and made efforts to regain a leadership role for the United States in international human rights inter-government institutions, such as the U.N. and the OAS. In a specific memorandum, Biden provided clear directions for U.S. agencies to initiate proactive measures in diplomacy, development/funding, and technical assistance, even exceeding the measures of the Obama administration. In addition, there were key appoint-ments, such as Samantha Power, known for her support of the human rights of LGBTQ people, as head of USAID; Jessica Stern, former executive director of our grantee OutRight, named special envoy on LGBTQ issues at the State Depart-ment; and Chantal Wong, the first out lesbian nominated ambassador to the Asian Development Bank. Vice President Kamala Harris included LGBTQ and HIV  NGOs among her meetings in Guatemala but also stated that Central American refugees should not come to the United States, thereby sending mixed messages to LGBTQ people facing violence. U.S. PortfolioAfter four years of an openly hostile and deeply harmful U.S. administration, grantees now work in a vastly different con-text. As we hear from groups, their work and priorities have not changed; if anything, they have been ratcheted up many notches. Grantees have shifted from resisting harm to proac-tively advancing their agendas. For example, we have heard from grantees that focus on immigrant justice that there is a real opportunity to essentially end migrant detention for Return to the 2020 Arcus Social Justice Program Strategy Evaluation ReportSOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | ANNUAL EVALUATION UPDATE: 2020 | SEPTEMBER 2021For more information about reports in our learning series: arcusfoundation.org/learningsSign up for updates: arcusfoundation.org/subscribeConnect with us: arcusfoundation.org/socialDesign: ©Emerson, Wajdowicz Studios / NYC / www.designEWS.com  Photography: Front cover: ©Kike ArnalAbout Arcus FoundationFounded in 2000 by Jon Stryker, the Arcus Foundation is a private grantmaking institution dedicated  to the idea that people can live in harmony with one another and the natural world.

Measuring against predetermined indicators, the report examines progress made within the program's three goal areas: increased safety, increased protections, and increased acceptance and inclusion. Insights gained from this assessment allow Arcus to determine how well our strategies are working, where we may need to question our assumptions, and whether the evidence points to the need to adjust our strategies.The data and information included in the report comes from grant reports submitted by our grantees; our ongoing engagement with grantees, colleague funders and others with relevant experience in our geographic regions; research reports; and media sources. In addition, Arcus analyzes its own grantmaking data to ensure that funding reflects the foundation's priorities and values",
