    "fullText": "For many people, espe-cially residents of the “Live Music Capital of the World,” jazz music is a familiar, and often welcomed, sound. On the streets of downtown Austin, one is sure to hear the smooth notes coming from a jazz band playing in a club or a street musician’s saxophone. But in the 1940s, Austi-nites might have been sur-prised to hear those notes coming from anywhere at all. The origin of jazz dates from the early 1910s, but it was still unfamiliar and unappreciated enough in the ‘40s that it prompted former Daily Texan writer, Pvt. E. Gartly Jaco, to write a series of articles about it, titled “Jazz from Jaco.” Though it may seem strange to have had such ar-ticles printed alongside news about World War II, perhaps it was all the more neces-sary to shift the attention of students to a topic such as jazz to remind them of the cultural movements also tak-ing place at the time. 1Thursday, October 3, 2013@thedailytexan facebook.com/dailytexanServing the University of Texas at Austin community since 1900dailytexanonline.com bit.ly/dtvidLIFE&ARTS PAGE 10 NEWS PAGE 3 SPORTS PAGE 6ACLX2Austin prepares for extra ACL daysUT falls out of top 25 world universities.PAGE 5Professors push social media in classrooms.PAGE 5NEWSIs online education really that great for UT?PAGE 4Texan’s sex column series serves key purpose.PAGE 4OPINIONAustin Roth is set to lead cross country senior year.PAGE 6Offensive balance paces UT soccer success.

Following a unanimous decision by Austin City Council, C3 Presents — the independent company that puts on the festival — has been permitted to double ACL from one weekend to two weekends. This year’s ACL Fest will be held Oct. 4-6 and 11-13, with the majority of bands playing both weekends. The doubling of festival time means a greater influx of out-of-towners. Emily Jackson, front desk clerk for Hostelling International Austin, said they are completely booked. “All 49 of our beds are booked for the weekends, but there’s vacancies in between,” Jackson said. “We’re seeing people come from Mexico, Australia and Germany, but most are from within the United States.”Jackson said the majority of the bookings last from Thursday through Sunday, an indicator that most of the guests are going to ACL.“Normally on festival weekends it’s like this,” Jackson said. “Our price is normally $28.30 per night and during ACL it’s $37.50.”Local restaurants, hotels planning to cash in twice By Shane Arthur Miller@shanearthurmillREVENUE page 8Austin City Limits Music Festival will extend to two weekends this year, and though the influx of an expected 225,000 visitors will necessitate road closures and increased shuttle bus service, city officials do not think the ad-dition of a second weekend will present difficulties.The Austin Police Department will use data gathered from previous years to prepare for and monitor the weekend festivals, held annually in Zilker Park. Both Barton Springs Road and Stratford Drive will be closed between Oct. 4-6 and 11-13.“With any event, we always have a debriefing afterwards with event promot-ers and various city staff,” William Manno, commander of specialized patrol and events planning, said. “We talk about what did not work … so when we start the planning stage for the next year’s event, [we discuss] what was identi-fied [and] what has been done to mitigate those issues from last year.”Alongside the Austin Parks and Recreation department and the transportation department, APD will monitor the two festival weekends from a command post outside Zilker Park to address any safety issues in a timely manner, Manno said.City police, transportation unfazed by two weekendsBy Amanda Voeller@amandaevoellerTRANSPORT page 2POLICE THROWBACKUTPD praises student response to fork attackJazz writeups defend now-classic genreBy Lan Le@lannnlePhoto courtesy of 1955 Cactus YearbookPvt. E. Gartly Jaco, pictured second from the left, returned to teach at UT in 1955. Jaco wrote columns defending jazz as legitimate music as a Daily Texan columnist in the 1940s.According to UTPD Sgt. Charles Bonnet, the students who overpowered 22-year-old Chenxi Deng after he used a fork to stab graduate student Li You in the nose last week were gutsy, but try-ing to be the hero isn’t always sensible. “We’re not going to take a stance saying everyone should get physically in-volved if you see some-thing happening.” Bonnet said. “We leave that up to an individual’s morality, their own physical fitness. If you see something hap-pening — if it means mak-ing a phone call, that’s what it means. These individuals felt comfortable subduing this guy, and it worked out in this case, but it might not always.”Bonnet said the students acted heroically. “I don’t think there’s any other way to describe their actions,” Bonnet said. “The main point is that we’re all in this together in terms of campus safety. Whether its reported crimes or suspi-cious activities, we want to encourage a spirit of coop-eration. This is just one way that manifested itself, but we’re not saying it’s the best way or the right way.”Electrical engineering se-nior Shangheng Wu was one of several witnesses named in the police affidavit. Al-though Wu was not involved in the struggle to overwhelm Deng, he said he witnessed the moment firsthand.“I heard a girl yelling continuously and I turned around,” Wu said. “A white By Alberto Long@ albertolongFORK page 2 JAZZ page 22breckenridgeWWW.UBSKI.COM 1-800-SKI-WILD   •   1-800-754-9453COLLEGE SKI & BOARD WEEKVail • Beaver Creek • Keystone • Arapahoe Basin20 Mountains. 5 Resorts. 1 Price.plus t/sFROMONLY2 NEWSThursday, October 3, 2013Main Telephone(512) 471-4591EditorLaura Wright(512) 232-2212editor@dailytexanonline.comManaging EditorShabab Siddiqui(512) 232-2217managingeditor@dailytexanonline.comNews Office(512) 232-2207news@dailytexanonline.comMultimedia Office(512) 471-7835dailytexanmultimedia@ gmail.comSports Office(512) 232-2210sports@dailytexanonline.comLife & Arts Office(512) 232-2209dtlifeandarts@gmail.comRetail Advertising(512) 471-1865joanw@mail.utexas.eduClassified Advertising(512) 471-5244classifieds@ dailytexanonline.comCONTACT USVolume 114, Issue 36TOMORROW’S WEATHERHigh Low92 71New girl, man.COPYRIGHTCopyright 2013 Texas Student Media.

The article, published Sept. 1, 1944 — exactly five years after World War II had begun — hit each of those points, with Jaco’s fervor equal to that of any jazz musician’s today. In the case against those who called jazz “discon-nected noise,” Jaco said, “Laws of psychology prove that when a person cannot understand something, he either shuns it altogether or denounces it in some man-ner,” a statement many non-mainstream musicians to-day would likely agree with. Jaco returned with his second article on Oct. 3, this time defining jazz for the “laymen,” though he admit-ted it “would be like attempt-ing to depict art without il-lustration, music without notes, life without living.” With these limitations placed on him, Jaco began to describe jazz. “Originality and individu-ality is its keynote, emotion and phrasing is its medium of expression and syncopat-ed rhythm is its basis,” Jaco said. “To be colloquial, jazz is democratic music.” Jaco’s third article in the series, published Nov. 30, boasted a bright future for jazz in the post-war era, cit-ing the success of many of the day’s jazz musicians, in-cluding Coleman Hawkins and Don Byas. In addition to predict-ing the popularity of jazz, Jaco briefly discussed the differences between the musical talents of white and African-American jazz performers in the ‘40s, lean-ing heavily in favor of music produced by the latter. “Past performances of mixed white and colored musicians in a jam session proved that the colored jazz artist is far superior and more advanced in his musi-cal ideas than his opposing white performer,” Jaco said. While Jaco’s opinion con-cerning the connection be-tween race and musical talent might be taken with a grain of salt, the rise of artists such as Buddy Johnson and Dizzy Gillespie following the war and the continued popularity of jazz today reveal his pre-dictions were on track.  In a city now known for the diverse genres that fill its clubs, bars and cafes, it is hard to imagine the need to make the case for the seem-ingly-classic jazz; but Jaco’s articles are a good reminder that even the classics had to face a little resistance. guy just ran to the assail-ant immediately and the as-sailant was tackled down to the ground. The white guy restrained the assailant and kept him on the ground, yelling that ‘What the fuck are you doing? You just stabbed a girl!’ The other witnesses held the assailant’s feet and helped keep him on the floor.” According to the police affidavit, You had four vis-ible puncture wounds on the left side of her nose and abrasions near her left eye, as well as a possible nose fracture.Hongjiang Li, an electrical and computer engineering graduate student who knows the victim personally, said she is getting better.“All I can say about the victim is that she’s recover-ing,” Li said. “She doesn’t want this to be a public topic anymore.”According to Bonnet, Deng followed the victim from China in order to re-kindle a romantic relation-ship. The police affidavit said Deng was auditing classes that would put him in close contact with the victim.Non-UT students are vir-tually unrestricted in regis-tering to audit classes and only require an instructor’s signature and $20.Deng will be in court on Oct. 9. He is charged with aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury, un-der the category of dating violence, which is a second-degree felony with a maxi-mum sentence of 20 years in prison.Deng’s attorney, Peter Bloodworth, declined to comment on the case.“Our goal is, as citizens recognize that there’s an is-sue, we try to correct it that night, and we’ll put it in place for the next night if what we did worked,” Manno said.Jake Dirr, Austin Center for Events spokesman, said the event’s additional week-end will not have a dramatic impact on transportation schedules in Austin.“This event doesn’t require a large amount of road clo-sures … and it’s the same plan that we implement more or less every year,” Dirr said. “Now we just implement it for two weekends [which] doesn’t require a whole lot of additional planning.”Manno said many resi-dents of the neighborhoods around Zilker Park have complained about people parking near their houses, so APD will have a greater pres-ence in the area to enforce parking restrictions.“ACL has reimbursed the [police] department [for] the cost of the officers for this traffic mitigation and en-forcement in the neighbor-hoods, so this is not costing the taxpayers,” Manno said. Because Zilker Park does not offer parking for most festi-val visitors, a free shuttle leaves from Republic Square on the corner of 4th and Guadal-upe. During the 2012 festival, 85,158 patrons used the shuttle.ACL will pay Zilker Metro-politan Park a total of $53,060 for the event, according to the contract between the festival and the city. The festival con-tributed $102 million to the Austin economy in 2012 in its standard one-weekend format.Although each band is dif-ferent, the majority of bands visiting for ACL will stay downtown during the festival weekends but will not stay in Austin during the week.Zilker Park closed for event set-up on Sept. 23 and will remain closed to the public until Oct. 26.TRANSPORT continues from page 1JAZZcontinues from page 1Engineering renovations to begin in NovemberRenovations to various campus buildings will begin this November to prepare for the demolition of the En-gineering Science Building next fall and accommodate students, faculty and staff displaced by the demolition.Project Management and Construction Services will oversee the renovations, which will cost $12 million. The ENS building will be torn down to prepare for the new Engineering Education Re-search Center, which the Uni-versity received some fund-ing for from the UT System Board of Regents last month.Michael DeBow, associate director of Project Manage-ment and Construction Ser-vices, said several projects have already been completed including a new custodial training facility, renovation of a space in the McCombs School of Business and the George I. Sánchez Building.“It is very important that we stay on schedule and get these renovations done, so that work on demolishing the ENS building will be able to start in the fall of 2014,” DeBow said.DeBow said some of the major projects beginning next month are moving the McKin-ney Engineering Library to the Perry-Casteneda Library and renovating five different floors of the UT Administration.DeBow said he works closely with those having to relocate and said they have thorough discussions about what needs have to be met to make the transition to their temporary facilities.— Reanna ZunigaThe white guy restrained the assailant and kept him on the ground, yelling that ‘What the fuck are you doing?

Kyle Herbst, Iliana StorchChants rang through the halls of the Tower as mem-bers of Save Our Communi-ty Coalition went to deliver a letter to President William Powers Jr. Wednesday, ex-pressing their concern with an outsourcing plan Powers’ Committee on Business Pro-ductivity released last year.The committee, com-posed of business leaders outside the UT community, wrote the plan titled “Smart-er Systems for a Greater UT” to identify untapped revenue sources and meth-ods the University might use to increase efficiency. One recommendation the report made was a potential increase in parking, food and housing prices.The group began its protest with a street per-formance providing back-ground on the Smarter Systems plan. After the performance, the coalition walked into the Tower to request a meeting with Powers about the group’s unhappiness with the plan.The coalition began last semester in response to the Smarter Systems plan, and is composed of student orga-nizations, faith leaders, local nonprofit organizations and the Texas State Employees Union, which protests the outsourcing and privatiza-tion of on-campus job and services. The coalition was formed by the United Stu-dents Against Sweatshops, a group which aims to protect the rights of student workers on and off campus. “Taking outsourcing off the table is a basic, minimal request from the communi-ty because this plan is wide reaching and we already know that outsourcing and privatization has a devastat-ing effects on local econo-mies and our community as a whole,” Plan II junior Bianca Hinz-Foley said.  The president’s office was locked when the group marched up the narrow staircases of the building. According to coalition member Sophie Poitier, a philosophy and rhetoric se-nior, the group plans to send an email since they were un-able to deliver the letter di-rectly. Poitier said the coali-tion will keep running the campaign until they get an acceptable response.“We don’t think it’s right for a university to cut costs when humans are involved,” Poitier said. “There are oth-er ways costs could be cut than a person’s livelihood.”Alonzo Mendoza, a 2012 UT alumnus who graduated with a masters in special ed-ucation, has been involved with the United Students Against Sweatshops for several years. Mendoza has been in the coalition since it was founded in January.“[The protest] is important to me because even though I’m not being directly af-fected by this, the reputation of UT is at stake,” Mendoza said. “As an [alumnus], I want to be proud of my university.”W&N 3NO PURCHASE NECESSARY.

Engineering renovations to begin in NovemberRenovations to various campus buildings will begin this November to prepare for the demolition of the En-gineering Science Building next fall and accommodate students, faculty and staff displaced by the demolition.Project Management and Construction Services will oversee the renovations, which will cost $12 million. The ENS building will be torn down to prepare for the new Engineering Education Re-search Center, which the Uni-versity received some fund-ing for from the UT System Board of Regents last month.Michael DeBow, associate director of Project Manage-ment and Construction Ser-vices, said several projects have already been completed including a new custodial training facility, renovation of a space in the McCombs School of Business and the George I. Sánchez Building.“It is very important that we stay on schedule and get these renovations done, so that work on demolishing the ENS building will be able to start in the fall of 2014,” DeBow said.DeBow said some of the major projects beginning next month are moving the McKin-ney Engineering Library to the Perry-Casteneda Library and renovating five different floors of the UT Administration.DeBow said he works closely with those having to relocate and said they have thorough discussions about what needs have to be met to make the transition to their temporary facilities.— Reanna ZunigaSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGYEnviroment crucial to gene developmentWhile many would pre-dict humans develop more as they age through experi-ences rather than through gene development, recent studies by psychology pro-fessors Elliot Tucker-Drob and Paige Harden and psychology graduate stu-dent Daniel Briley suggest the opposite.The three researchers collaborated on the study “Genetic and Environmen-tal Influences on Cogni-tion Across Development and Context,” focusing on how certain genes are dormant for a period of life, but when they become active, they reach differ-ent levels of potential de-pending on people’s living environment.“People have these genes that have the potential for them to learn and thrive … but because they’re living in impoverished situations, they’re not able to make use of those genetic poten-tials they have and they’re just not realizing them,” Tucker-Drob said.   A similar result is found when looking at the ge-netic relationship by age, Tucker-Drob said.“At first they’re dor-mant — the kids have them, but they just haven’t become active and even-tually what happens once when the kids are about 10 years old is that the genes are all turned on,” Tucker-Drob said.Briley and Tucker-Drob worked on another project, where they found cognitive ability links more with ge-netic differences in people as they age.“Our results indicate that in the very early stages of a child’s life, this increase in genetic influences can primarily be attributable to ‘novel’ genetic effects,” Briley said. “This could mean that certain genes are ‘turned on’ at specific developmental periods or that as children transition into new environments ge-netic influences that pre-viously were unimportant become important.”According to Briley, one explanation for the transi-tion is that children gain more control over their ac-ademic choices as they age.Briley and Tucker-Drob used meta-analysis — which combines data from multiple studies — to analyze the genetic cognition relationship. A portion of this data came from research done with the Texas Twin Project, which Tucker-Drob and Harden direct. Both stud-ies involve the hotly-de-bated topic of nature ver-sus nurture, according to Tucker-Drob.“The goal of this research isn’t to try to take a side in the nature-nurture de-bate — it’s actually to try to reconcile things so we can look at how genes and en-vironments work together,” Tucker-Drob said. Frank Mann, a graduate student who works with Tucker-Drob, said he finds this research helpful.“It’s not nature versus nurture; it’s nature and nur-ture working in concert to-gether,” Mann said. “I think it’s fascinating research. It provides a useful tool that can adds degree of nuisance to understand a variety of developmental processes.”By Wynne Davis@ wynneellynAs a computer science major, I am aware of the ever-increasing and potentially beneficial impact of technological innovation on soci-ety. Take education — students have access to a staggering amount of information and ma-terial through laptops and computer labs, on-line academic journal databases and forums like Piazza and Canvas. Most students actively use these resources — it would be foolish not to. In these cases, technological innovation means opportunities for advancement. In other cases, though, technological innovation means excuses for devolution.Recently, UT unveiled a “synchronous massive online course” (SMOC) program that provides both UT-students and non-UT students access to an online course for a several-hundred dollar fee. The program was touted as a way to retain the benefits of in-class learning while bringing those benefits to the masses. However, the “masses” didn’t exactly show up: Fewer than 40 non-UT students signed up as of the first full week of classes. It’s worth taking a step back and asking the question: What’s the purpose of SMOCs, or online education in general?The main argument is that it is cheaper, because technology makes it easier to bring lectures and other course material to a wider audience. But there is a hidden assumptions in this argument which is almost always taken for granted by our higher education leaders: that the quality of online education is sufficient to even be worth the cost.In July, San Jose State University decided to halt its project with online course pro-vider Udacity because two-thirds of the stu-dents enrolled in those online classes failed them. In contrast, the non-online versions of the course averaged at about two-thirds passing. The courses were Elementary Statis-tics, College Algebra and Entry-Level Math.As another example, a five-year study is-sued in 2011 by Columbia University’s Com-munity College Research Center tracked 51,000 students enrolled in Washington State technical and community colleges. It found a correlation between online course enrollment and failure to earn a degree or transfer to four-year colleges.The reasons for both of these failures are quite simple, and have been consistently cited by critics of online education schemes. The impersonality and lack of interaction in these online courses make learning and even passing far more difficult, especially for struggling students — having a teacher phys-ically present to answer your questions and work through things with the class makes the difference.On that note, it’s worth differentiating between “learning” and “passing,” because that’s a distinction that the “innovators” in higher education often blur. Transferring courses like Entry-Level Math to the on-line realm supposedly simplifies the way students acquire knowledge. But why “sim-plify” the process of learning? Having basic math skills is important enough to spend time on. If we think (as the “innovators” seem to) that education is simply about get-ting the credits to get the degree and then join the workforce, then we should simplify away. It’s the same simplification that comes about in the push for more high-stakes test-ing, which conflates multiple-choice ques-tions and grades with the struggle and re-ward of acquiring actual knowledge.The immediate counter-argument is that despite online education’s lesser quality, it is a necessary evil in light of the need to save money. The issue with this argument is that the cost of something can only be deemed appropriate when compared to its value. The value of online education is unproven: Ex-amples like San Jose State and the Columbia University report showing the high failing rates of students in online courses point out online education’s deficiencies. It is irrespon-sible to invest large sums of money in pro-grams of dubious quality, but disturbingly, that did not stop the UT System Board of Re-gents from paying out $5 million to partner with online education platform edX last year. The lesser cost of online education is often brought up, but large, undependable invest-ments are as impractical as it gets.The so-called “innovations” of online edu-cation — MOOCs, i>clickers, the flipped classroom, and so on — provide a false choice between quality and cost. These are not innovations. They are excuses for risky spending that pass over the question of edu-cational quality.Rathi is a computer science honors sopho-more from Austin.4A OPINIONLEGALESE | Opinions expressed in The Daily Texan are those of the editor, the Editorial Board or the writer of the article.

These level-headed and uncontroversial com-ments are surprising, considering Regnerus’ signed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case which overturned California’s anti-gay marriage Proposition 8.Moreover, in recent months, Regnerus has inserted himself into the international debate regarding same-sex parenting in a decidedly political way, raising important questions about his complicity in the ways in which his study is being used to limit LGBTQ rights.Initially, I defended Regnerus’ right to fight for his flawed study in the academic sphere. However, it’s clear to me now that assuming good faith was a naïve mistake. I was wrong: Regnerus has not been irresponsibly silent. At best, he has been reckless in his promotion of his work without regard to the fallout. At worst, he is aware and doesn’t mind. In February of this year, Regnerus gave an interview to a Russian language news agency in Ukraine. The homophobic article that resulted cites “shocking” evidence from a “reputable university” (ours)  showing in-ferior results for children of same-sex par-enting. The reporter asked Regnerus about a September 2012 investigation into whether Regnerus breached ethics standards in his research protocol. The article claims that not only did the University say that Regnerus did nothing wrong, which is true, but that UT has allegedly tested the methodology and confirmed that the research is of high qual-ity. Actually, the University has not taken a position on the quality of the study. In the Q-and-A, Regnerus explains the Uni-versity’s ruling on the ethics allegations. He re-states that his data is accurate and accessible. The article ends by saying the study shows “the tragic consequences” of gay parenting.While Regnerus’ responses themselves are no different from what he has told this news-paper, Vse Novosti is not The Daily Texan. Regnerus gave this interview in a Russian-language news outlet shortly after the State Department expressed its concern about the “discriminatory” anti-gay laws then being debated there, laws that were later passed.    Adding cowardice to irresponsibility, Reg-nerus still told The Dallas Morning News in June that he could not police ideological uses of his study. Regenerus’ Vse Novosti inter-view seems even more reckless in hindsight as his study was later used by Russian law-maker Andrei Zhuravlyov to advance a bill that would allow the removal of children from same-sex households. A few weeks ago Regnerus spoke out against Zhuravlyov’s bill, and I applaud him for that. But in the same column, Regnerus defended his foray into the political sphere based on his personal opposition to gay marriage. Zhurav-lyov’s  bill had not come up when Regnerus gave his interview. However, are we to believe that Regnerus was not aware of Russia’s general situation when he chose to respond to the Rus-sian language outlet even as he declined to be interviewed by The New York Times? University documents show that the Office of Public Affairs collaborated with Regnerus on the initial  press release for the NFSS study. They highlighted the sensitivity of the study and reminded him of the expected negative reaction to the research. Given the risks to the University’s and his co-researchers’ repu-tations, why didn’t Regnerus steer clear of high-profile political debates his study doesn’t address? Regnerus claims that he is merely an objective scientist, but in the last year he has acted more like a political hack than an intel-lectual responsibly using the his position.Perhaps the newest Russian initiative to remove children from the homes of same-sex couples has taught Regnerus the risks of inserting himself into complex cultural and legal debates. If so, Regnerus should admit his role in politicizing the study and apolo-gize for contributing to its misuse. If not, the University community should call him to ac-count for his irresponsibility.

The two-year de-fault rate has increased from 9.1 percent to 10 percent, and the three-year default rate has increased from 13.5 percent to 14.7 percent.

And it’ll only get better from here. The Weather Channel forecasts highs of 77 and 73 degrees for the weekend — just in time for ACL.The Daily Texan’s sex column series just turned one month old, and as expected, it’s already received some backlash.It’s a bit cheesy, and the comical, vulgar na-ture of the writing has offended some and will continue to do so. On social media, I’ve seen replies to the columns from the Texan’s ac-count that mourn the desperate direction the Texan has taken and criticize the paper for contributing to the “decline of journalism.” (Full disclosure: since the sex columns are handled through our Life & Arts department, I had no part in writing, editing or coming up with the ideas for the columns. I read them for the first time when they appeared on the Texan’s website).Whether people personally like the sex column series or not cannot be changed; some people may never wrap their heads around the idea that a newspaper can simul-taneously produce enterprising journalism and a sex column, or that the two types of work are both of value.However, if the purpose of the sex column extends beyond attracting attention, to the promotion of open and honest conversations about sex, it can be nothing but a social good for our University.Having a column where four anonymous writers of varying sexual orientations and ex-periences talk about a weekly topic, ranging from first kisses to masturbation, is beneficial to a college population because it desensitizes taboo topics and embraces the diversity of sexual history and preferences. By including everyone in the conversation, and narrating the real version of how sex plays out instead of the idolized one seen in the media, students can make sense of their own sexual encoun-ters and questions. This freedom of expres-sion about sex is like a breath of fresh air to college students in Texas.It’s a known fact that Texas in particular does poorly when it comes to providing high school students with objective information on sexual education. In 2004, the State Board of Educa-tion approved controversial health textbooks that mentioned no methods of contraception other than avoiding sex altogether. Unsurpris-ingly, Texas has the highest percentage of teen-age pregnancies in the nation. It is no stretch to assume that Texas’ abstinence-only approach to sex education has failed, because putting so much emphasis on purity leaves Texas students with little knowledge of what to do to stay safe. The University, however, has substantial resources on sexual education and health. University Health Services offers free peer-led workshops on sexual health. The Voices against Violence organization covers the darker side of sex, offering interactive per-formances such as Get Sexy, Get Consent, to help students recognize the signs of an abusive relationship and the rules of con-sent. Any UT student can organize a free performance for their extracurricular group with two to three weeks’ notice. In addition, The Gender and Sexuality Center is a well-known institution that serves the interests of women and the LBGTQ community at UT. They provide both a mentor program and walk-in advising.However, many students — due to time constraints, disinterest or other reasons — don’t go out of their way to attend available seminars, classes or productions.Which is why the Texan’s sex columns, vulgar though they may sometimes be, are crucially important. A column in the school newspaper is a public forum, at the tip of stu-dents’ fingers both tangibly and over the Web. It’s easy, effortless and takes less than five minutes to read. And they will read them: the columns are consistently some of the most-trafficked stories on the Texan’s site. A sex column can’t be credited with making monumental positive changes to public health. However, it is a medium that may inspire stu-dents to do their own personal research, see STD/STI screening as a common and often necessary precaution, and to be more assertive about what they want sexually.Manescu is a journalism and international relations junior from Ploiesti, Romania.By Larisa ManescuDaily Texan Columnist@LarisaManescuA few years ago, having Twitter or Facebook open during class was a sure sign a student was distracted — but as social media becomes more popular, many profes-sors have embraced the sites and integrated them into their own curriculums.UT professors from a range of colleges discussed methods through which they integrate social media into their classrooms in or-der to promote collabora-tive learning. The profes-sors said social media sites including Twitter, Face-book and hoot.me estab-lish links between students and professors.Associate English profes-sor Elizabeth Richmond-Garza said she focuses on the different ways people present themselves in per-son and online and hopes her students understand the importance of representing themselves honestly.“The discipline of Twit-ter is what I am interested in them understanding,” Rich-mond-Garza said. “I teach [the concept of] double lives, and social media [has cre-ated] a virtual life for my students. Twitter is a double life through verbalization.”Richmond-Garza said she puts her teaching material on one screen and a Twit-ter feed on another, allowing students to comment and ask questions via Twitter in real time.“I have learned you must be interactive with social media for it to work success-fully,” Richmond-Garza said. Wanda Cash, a journalism professor and associate di-rector of the College of Com-munication, said Twitter and Facebook provide valuable storytelling tools, an idea she emphasizes with her jour-nalism students. Cash said students must have Twitter accounts, which they are al-lowed to use in class.“I require a Twitter ac-count and take a grade on it, so I know students are be-ing interactive,” Cash said. “Students can go back and see what classmates and pro-fessors have to say about spe-cific topics.”Clinton Tuttle, a UT exten-sion instructor in the busi-ness school, uses hoot.me, a Facebook application that allows students in a class to connect without “friending” each other, to make his large classes seem more intimate.Anne Braseby, a faculty development specialist in the Center for Teaching and Learning, said social media will become even more rel-evant to students as it is inte-grated directly into Canvas and Blackboard, two online course information sites.“This is relevant to stu-dents, if the faculty decide to use this method and encour-age [and] maybe even reward students for using social me-dia to learn collaboratively,” Braseby said.NEWS 5         Right now, PPD is looking for qualified participants  for a post-surgical pain relief research study of an investigational medication.

In the 2012-13 rankings, UT tied for 25th with the Georgia Institute of Technology. The University’s overall score also dropped by 6.6 points to 72.2 out of 100 possible points. Times Higher Education rank-ings score universities by looking at 13 different cat-egories including teach-ing, research, citations in academic research, inter-national outlook and in-dustry income.UT spokesman Gary Susswein said the Uni-versity’s ranking did not change significantly.“It was a minimal drop,” Susswein said. “The bot-tom line is we continue to rank in the top tier of uni-versities around the world.”Susswein said UT ranked fifth among American public univer-sities as it did last year. The University of Califor-nia-Berkeley, University of California-Los Ange-les, University of Michi-gan–Ann Arbor and the University of Washington ranked higher than UT in that category.The California Institute of Technology placed first in this year’s rankings.In September, UT dropped six places from 46th to 52nd in U.S. News and World Report’s 2014 national universities rankings.—Jacob KerrNEWS BRIEFLYUC Berkeley honors President PowersPresident William Pow-ers Jr. was named the Uni-versity of California at Berkeley’s Alumnus of the year for 2014.Powers received his undergraduate chemistry degree at UC-Berkeley in 1967. According to UC-Berke-ley’s website, Powers was honored with the position for his experience in the U.S. Navy, managing editor of the Harvard Law Review, legal consultant to the U.S. Congress and the Brazilian legislature, as well has his role as UT president. “As president, Powers has made great progress in transforming UT into one of the finest public research universities in the nation,” the statement said. “He has strengthened the undergraduate core curriculum, inaugurated the School of Undergrad-uate Studies and aggres-sively recruited a diverse student body and faculty.” Powers joins various UC-Berkeley professors holding the Alumnus of the Year title.—Christine AyalaCAMPUSQSA hosts domestic violence seminarUT’s Queer Students Al-liance began National Do-mestic Violence Awareness Month with a seminar focus-ing on defining healthy rela-tionships Wednesday.“No two relationships look the same, so domestic violence can be difficult to define, but it comes down to power and control,” said Erin Burrows, health education coordinator for Voices Against Violence, who led the presentation. “Domestic violence comes down to anytime you feel afraid of your partner, no matter the cause.” About 40 students worked in groups to answer ques-tions such as, “What does healthy communication look/sound like?” and “How do you take care of yourself in a relationship?” English senior Tianhe “Zen” Ren, vice director of the alli-ance, said the goal of the event was to raise awareness about domestic violence within the LGBTQ community.“A lot of domestic violence awareness focuses on het-eronormative relationships,” Ren said. “We have to learn to recognize the signs of violence in LGBTQ relation-ships as well.” Burrows said domestic violence within LGBTQ re-lationships can be difficult to define.“Especially if someone hasn’t come out to their fam-ily yet, their partner may use their sexual orientation against them with homopho-bia, transphobia, etc.,” she said. Burrows said physical or sexual violence is “just the tip” of the domestic violence ice-berg, while verbal and emo-tional abuse often go unseen.Ren said one step to re-ducing domestic violence would be to have more allies within the LGBTQ commu-nity promoting education and awareness. “People feel uncomfort-able coming to the Gender Studies Center or to QSA meetings because they feel others will assume they’re LGBTQ,” she said. “We just want more people to be aware and become allies for students who are LGBTQ.” The group’s treasurer Rog-elio Meza said an ally is any-one who personally supports the LGBTQ community.“We want to educate people and bring aware-ness to the community,” Meza said. “It makes me happy to see non-LGBTQ students at our meetings supporting us and being willing to learn more.”Meza said support is about more than just acceptance — it also means becoming more educated. He said sex education in schools often focuses only on heterosexu-al relationships.“We want to bring LG-BTQ awareness to the gen-eral populace as well as to LGBTQ students them-selves,” he said. “Not every-one is the same and that’s a beautiful thing.”Aaron Berecka / Daily Texan StaffQSA Member Devon Howard helps run Wednesday’s workshop on maintaining healthy relationships.

By Anna Daugherty@DaughertyannaSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGYProfessors embrace social media in classroomsBy Cinnamon Cornell@CinnamonCornellSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY Costa Rican singing mice subject of researchTwo species of mice found in the mountains of Central America sing to mark their territory, according to a new study by UT researchers.This finding came after postdoctoral student Bret Pasch researched two species of mice — the Alston singing mice and their cousins, the Chiriqui — and wrote his dis-sertation under associate biol-ogy professor Steven Phelps.Pasch first became inter-ested in the mice in 1999 while taking a tropical biol-ogy course in Costa Rica.“I listened for the mice in the forest and caught a few,” Pasch said. “I have been re-turning on-and-off to study them ever since.”Pasch worked with Phelps, who began to study the singing mice 10 years ago when he first came upon them in a field guide of mam-mals in Central America. “I was looking for a species that I could study that showed interesting variation in their social behavior… [so] I could use neurobiological and ge-netic methods with to under-stand the evolution of that be-havior in detail,” Phelps said.According to Pasch, the results of this study suggest a wider understanding of the geographical boundaries the mice inhabit.“Our findings provide new insight into the role of vocal communication in shaping the geographic distributions of animals,” Pasch said. “Be-cause closely related species often share similar ecological requirements — eating simi-lar foods and living in similar places — as well as similar means of communication, the researchers suggest inter-specific communication will be a common contributor to natural range boundaries.” The Alston and Chiriqui mice sound like small birds during their song, according to Phelps.“Songs consist of a set of rapidly repeated notes, called trills,” Pasch said in a state-ment. “Notes are produced each time an animal opens and closes its tiny mouth, roughly 15 times per second.”Pasch conducted a signifi-cant amount of independent field work before coming to a conclusion for his dissertation. Phelps said the combined field work is an impressive look at how animals behave in their natural environments.The relationship Pasch found between the mice’s singing and the geographical boundaries are not the end of the Phelps’ lab studies on singing mice. “The next step for us is to understand whether the be-haviors responses the mice show are learned or whether they’re evolution adaptations,” said Phelps. “And on top of that, I would like to know how the brain is processing those different signals.”By Wynne Davis@wynneellynOur findings provide new insight into the role of vocal communi-cation in shaping the geographic distribu-tions of animals.—Bret Pasch, postdoctoral studentEthan OblakDaily Texan StaffWanda Cash, a journalism professor and as-sociate director of the College of Communication, discusses the value of creating Facebook groups for students to engage with  one another.6 SPTSGET HELPPERSONAL TRAININGutrecsports.orgMOTIVATIONSTARTS HERE6CHRIS HUMMER, SPORTS EDITOR / @texansportsThursday, October 3, 2013WACO — In front of a packed house of just more than 3,000 fans — the most ever for a Baylor volleyball game — at Waco’s Ferrell Center, No. 4 Texas had to fight to earn its third-con-secutive Big 12 victory 3-1.The Longhorns (9-2, 3-0 Big 12) opened up the game strong with a dominant first set on both sides of the net. Sophomore middle block-er Molly McCage tallied a team-high four kills on just six attempts while Texas outhit Baylor .400-.094 en route to a 25-17 Game 1 win.Despite the dominance, Texas allowed Baylor to make the opening set closer than it actually was, com-mitting a few late errors before eventually snagging the game. The sloppy play carried over to the start of the second frame as Baylor jumped out to a command-ing 13-9 lead.“We just weren’t manag-ing our game, and we’ve got to make better decisions as far as good swings versus bad swings,” head coach Jer-ritt Elliott said.With the momentum heavily on the Bears’ side, Texas dug deep to secure an 11-2 run led by four service aces from junior outside hit-ter Haley Eckerman. Baylor responded with a 5-0 run of its own but Texas held on for a 25-21 set win.After falling behind early in the third frame 9-4, the Longhorns rallied to tie the game at 13. The end of the set was a back and forth battle but Baylor closed it on a 4-1 run to capture a 25-23 win.“I think in the third sets we usually get a little relaxed and teams tend to come back and want to win that set,” freshman middle block-er Chiaka Ogbogu said. “We played at the same level in the second set, but they just had a little more intensity.”Texas wasted no time es-tablishing the tempo in the fourth set, jumping out to a 14-9 lead before a 7-4 run made it 21-14. The Bears did their best to push Texas to the brink and a fifth set, but the Longhorns proved too much taking the set 25-19.“The third set was probably one of our worst all season,” Elliott said. “I thought they rose to the challenge and they competed, and that’s part of the game. It’s unfortunate, but you have to be perfect on both sides of the ball.”Eckerman led Texas with 15 kills as Texas outhit Baylor .299-.211 in the contest and won the block battle 11-7. Ogbogu continued her clutch play as she notched 10 total kills including three in the final set.“I know how good of a team we are and our op-ponents especially do,” Og-bogu said. “We had already won two sets so I felt like I had to come in and be really confident and keep swing-ing knowing my setters were gonna trust me.”With a 3-0 start in confer-ence play, the battle-tested Longhorns will take on LSU on Saturday afternoon in Baton Rouge.“We just need to stay con-sistent,” Elliott said. “But I think we’re doing things better for longer stretches of time than we’ve done earlier in the season.”SIDELINEHorns cage Bears in WacoVOLLEYBALLThe sun has not yet dawned, but it’s 5:45 a.m., and the buzzing of the alarm clock indicates to senior cross country runner Austin Roth it’s time to begin the daily grind. Roth and the cross coun-try team begin their practice at 6:30 a.m. and practice for aboutt two hours. After practice, Roth goes through stretching, class and repeats it again the next day. “I have to remind my-self that there are results to be had,” Roth said. “None of us would put in all this work if there weren’t great results. For us we put in all this work to win a champi-onship or a race.” Roth has had success competing in indoor and outdoor track. During his sophomore and junior years, he qualified for the NCAA West Preliminar-ies and received All-Big 12 honors in the 3,000-meter outdoor steeplechase. Roth also had success running in 3,000-meter and 1,500- meter indoor track events.During his first three years on the 40 Acres, Roth has only competed in six cross country events. But this season, he de-cided to return full-time to cross country. As a senior, this is Roth’s last chance to run as a Longhorn and to help his  teammates. “It was important — espe-cially after my last two sea-sons where I didn’t complete the seasons — to comeback and give it one last shot,” Roth said. “We have a really solid team this year. I just wanted to get the most out of the last chance I have.” And Roth is doing just that by being a leader on the team. As senior member of the cross country team, Roth feels that it is important to mentor his teammates. “I try to be as much of a leader as I can but I also try to help the guys who are going to be carrying the Texas legacy into the future,” Roth said.Roth has had a great start to his season, he has two top-five finishes and won the Ricardo Romo Classic in San Antonio. Unfortunately, winning has eluded him as he has only won two events during his collegiate career, though he stressed the importance of team success.“Ultimately, I would rath-er finish fifth in a race with all my teammates around me,” said Roth. “It’s a lot bet-ter than to just be with your teammates coming through the line.” Charlie Pearce / Daily Texan StaffFreshman middle blocker Chiaka Ogbogu goes for a kill in Texas’ four-set win against Baylor Wednesday night.

The Parker, Colo. native had surgery to repair her injured left hip on Sept. 30 and will be forced to red-shirt as a result.“Nicole is a valuable and instrumental member of our program,” head coach Jerritt Elliott said in a state-ment. “She is the ultimate competitor and an amazing young woman that we are lucky to have in our pro-gram. We will be right there with her each step of the way and I can’t wait to see her leadership on the court in 2014.”Dalton had 14 starts in 31 matches as a freshman in 2012.

Two of this weekend’s scheduled college football games are now in jeopardy: Air Force at Navy and Army at Boston College. Navy is in a favorable position here, as it funds its athletic programs through ticket sales, concessions and licensing. Army and Air Force use government funds for athletics, and so are in less control of their own spending. Boston Col-lege has offered to pay for Army’s travel to this Satur-day’s game, and Navy has done the same for Air Force. Of course, neither of these brotherly acts are at all altruistic: The admirals at the Naval Academy and the Jesuit brothers at Boston College all know quite well the value of a home football date in comparison to the cost of a chartered plane. The U.S. Department of Defense is expected to an-nounce Thursday whether Army’s players are allowed to get on a bus to Boston, and a Pentagon spokesman speculated Wednesday as to whether concession proceeds from the Naval Academy football program could be used to fund travel for the re-mainder of their season. It is difficult to determine what is more bothersome — that the soccer season at Navy was in jeopardy be-cause of Congress’ obstinacy or that the nation’s military leaders have been scram-bling for three days to ar-range funding for a football game. Once again, the needs and well-being of student-athletes seem to be a periph-eral consideration at best.The administrations at the academies aren’t at fault here. Like the rangers at Yel-lowstone National Park or docents at the Smithsonian Institution, they are victims of out-of-touch decision-making and a business cli-mate where public relations tend to wash out truth and common sense. This weekend’s games will probably be saved. But for the athletes at the service academies have been left in a week of limbo, not knowing if the practices they’re slog-ging through all afternoon will be for an inter-squad scrimmage or one of the big-gest games on their schedule.By Joe CapraroDaily Texan Columnist@joecapraroIllustration by Ploy Buraparate / Daily Texan StaffUltimately, I would rather finish fifth in a race with all my team-mates around me.

This normally friendly scrim-mage featured a new aspect that looked to reinforce the team’s mantra of competition. Like a game of pick up, Texas’ seniors were given the respon-sibility of selecting the swim-mers on their teams. As the last meet rolled around, it became clear the orange and white teams were separated in the standings by less than 10 points. As the anchor legs began their final lap, chants of, “Go” and, “Finish Strong!” erupt-ed from the teams and were echoed throughout the com-plex by spectators. The white team came out victorious on paper 161.5 to 158.5, but as head coach Eddie Reese ad-dressed his team, the focus shifted away from who won and who lost.“One of the best meets I’ve seen,” Reese said. “We got the best out of everybody today. Seniors put together great line-ups and it’s exciting but there’s a lot of hard work ahead.”The meet was Reese’s first opportunity to see his fresh-men in a competition and they didn’t disappoint. Freshman Michael Hixon claimed the one-meter diving event, fresh off an appearance at the FINA World Championship.“The freshmen know it’s about swimming the entire distance,” Reese said. “Not just to the wall, but through the wall. To do well we must be a team from the first swimmer to the last.”The meet saw notable per-formances from junior Clay Youngquist, sophomore Sam Lewis and freshman Will Licon, who all posted two wins a piece in events for the white team. After the meet, Youngquist was pleased with the performances of some of his younger teammates.“We saw what our freshman class was made of and they put up some good numbers,” Youngquist said. Despite their promise, team coaches and veterans know the freshmen will need leadership to set the precedents of hard work in the coming months. Leadership will need to come from veterans such as junior diver Will Chandler who also performed well in his fourth Orange-White meet.“They ask me questions all the time and I just try and give them the best answers,” Chandler said. The Longhorns open their season at home against North Carolina on Oct. 17. The team may be coming off its 34th consecutive Big 12 title, but at Texas, only the National Championship banners are hung from the rafters.Texas women’s soccer will hit the road to play West Virginia in Morgan-town, W.Va., and Kansas in Lawrence, Kan., coming off its first Big 12 Conference wins at home last weekend.Texas beat TCU on Fri-day and Iowa State on Sunday to improve to an 8-3-1 record on the season, marking a four game winning streak. The team’s last loss came on the road to Colorado College.Since the loss, Texas has outscored its opponents 11-1 and so far this sea-son it has seen 11 different players ranging from fresh-man forwards to the soph-omore goalkeeper score a goal and 16 players record either an assist or goal.“It takes a little bit of pressure off of each player and it certainly makes it hard to defend us,” head coach Angela Kelly said. “We’re going to need to be battle tested and we’re go-ing to need every single one of us to be plugged in.”Of the 11 players who scored, six have scored multiple goals. In 2012, only nine different players scored for the entire season. Sophomore forward Kelsey Shimmick and junior de-fender Brooke Gilbert lead the team with four goals apiece, followed by sopho-more midfielder Chantale Campbell with three. The Mountaineers hold an 8-2-2 record and also head into the matchup on a four-game winning streak and an undefeated mark in Big 12 play, having beat Oklahoma State and Baylor in their last outings. The win against Baylor broke up a 31-game win streak for the Bears. Since join-ing the conference last year, West Virginia has yet to lose a Big 12 regular season game.“I’ve competed against West Virginia my whole ca-reer, especially at Tennessee and I have a ton of respect for their coaching staff and for their style of play,” Kelly said after the Iowa State win. “It’s a great environ-ment in Morgantown. This is like an NCAA first or second round game to me. We’re ultimately here to win championships, so we need a little bit of that seasoning and we’re going to get it.”Kansas will play TCU at home Sunday after tak-ing on Texas on Friday. Going into the weekend, the Jayhawks have a 5-5-1 record, and are coming off a loss to Santa Clara. The Jawhawks will open confer-ence play against the teams from Texas.“It’s one game at time,” Kelly said. “It’s still very early in the conference sea-son and we can’t ever look past an opponent and we’ve been taking it one game at a time.”Potent attack, balance leading LonghornsBy Brittany Lamas@brittany_lamasJoe Capraro / Daily Texan StaffSophomore midfielder Lindsey Meyer defends against TCU Friday night in a 2-0 Longhorn win.

To do well we must be a team from the first swimmer to the last.—Eddie Reese, men’s swimming & diving head coach8 L&AAtoms are small. Very small. If all 7 billion people on earth were the size of a hydrogen atom, and they all hugged each other tightly to form a giant ball, that ball would still only be about 1 billionth the size of a grain of sand.And the parts that make up atoms are much smaller than even that. In fact, the hydrogen atom is about a billion times larger than the proton at its center.And electrons? If they do have a definite size — which they probably don’t — it’s less than one thousandth the size of a proton.Atoms make up every-thing, but they’re mostly empty space. Everything we see, hear and feel is, on an atomic scale, an illu-sion. When you’re looking at your cat, you’re not look-ing at her, you’re looking at the photons of light that her fur scattered back into your eye. When you hear her purr, what you’re hearing is a wave of vibrating particles traveling from her mouth to your ear. And when you rub your hand against her back, you’re not actually touch-ing anything, but you feel the repulsive forces of your mutual outer electrons. You may even pick up a few extra electrons in the process, only to lose them again in a shock the next time you touch a door handle.And that’s not even the weirdest part of the world of the small.The physics of the sub-atomic world, referred to as quantum mechanics, rep-resents a major departure from the world that we in-habit. Even the concept of measurement doesn’t apply in the same way that it does in our more conventional “classical world.”This comes down to Bell’s Theorem, which says that for the predictions of quan-tum mechanics to work, there can’t be any “hidden” variables.To get an idea of how this works, electrons have a qual-ity called spin, which can be “spin up” or “spin down.” What is spin? We’re not exactly sure, but it affects the direction that an elec-tron moves when placed in a magnetic field.So let’s send 100 electrons through a spin detector. We will measure some as spin up and the rest as spin down.Send them through again and the detector should spit out the exact same results.These measurements de-pend on the orientation of the magnetic field. If you rotate the field 10 degrees or so, the results might change slightly: One electron will probably have the opposite spin as what it had before.Rotate the device another 10 degrees, for a total of 20 away from the initial posi-tion, and through symmetry, we should see the same effect. One of the electrons from the previous result should have the opposite spin. It could be the electron that switched before — in which case we’d be back to the same result as the original measurement. More likely though, it would be a different one, in which case 98 of the 100 electrons should have the same value as they did initially.But what if we start over, measure the 100 electrons from scratch, and then ro-tate the device 20 degrees before taking a second measurement?Intuition tells us that we should get the same result: Ninety eight or more of the electrons should return the same value. But quantum mechanical predictions and measurements indicate that the actual value is only 97.In other words, mea-suring with that 10 de-gree alignment somehow messed with the spin of our electrons. But that’s not quite right. It didn’t “mess” with the results; it created new results. Neither ex-periment gives the correct values of the spin because there is no definite value of the spin — at least not be-fore it’s measured.If this seems confusing, that’s because it is. Even those who devote their lives to quantum mechanics don’t understand it, though they do develop an intu-ition for it, and many think we never will, nor should we expect to.We live in a fascinating universe full of enormous galaxies, black holes, qua-sars, dark matter and who knows what else. But per-haps the most fascinating part, as the study of quan-tum mechanics shows time and again, is that even its building blocks are com-pletely baffling.8 Thursday, October 3, 2013 LIFE&ARTSSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGYAtomic marvels and mysteriesIllustration by Ploy Buraparate / Daily Texan StaffBy Robert Starr@robertkstarrMost businesses report higher expectations for the two weekend format. Food vendor The Mighty Cone, known for its easy-to-eat chicken in torti-llas, are doubling its inventory. The Mighty Cone has been catering ACL since the second incarnation in 2002, when the festival reached out to owner Jeff Blank to run a food booth. “Last year, we sold about 45,000 cones,” Sara Couring-ton, general manager of The Mighty Cone, said. “I’m in love with ACL’s commitment to local Austin food vendors because it’s respectful to what Austin’s all about.” Another local Austin eatery, Amy’s Ice Creams, shares the same optimism. “We aren’t necessarily ex-pecting to see a 100 percent increase in sales but at least 80 percent,” said Aaron Clay, marketing and public rela-tions director. “What’s inter-esting is that the weather is going to play an even bigger role; When the weather is be-tween 72-88 degrees, it’s the best time to eat ice cream.”Amy’s has been at ACL since the beginning and sold a reported $45,000 of ice cream at ACL 2012. Several music shows will also be played at venues like Emo’s, Stubb’s and Antone’s, all of which C3 owns or operates.As part of its contract, C3 Presents will pay the city of Austin a base sum of $53,060 plus $3 per 3-day wristband sold. In 2009, the base sum was only $24,830. The festival is notorious for producing mass amounts of trash at the festival grounds, which C3 is legally obligated to take care of. “C3 rents the facility and they’re in charge of trash pick-up. The department works with them, but we’re not in charge of clean up,” said Vic-tor Ovalle, manager of Austin Parks and Recreation public information and marketing. C3 festival spokeswoman Lindsay Hoffman is more than confident about this year’s environmental work-force. Hoffman said C3 will have about 200 volunteers per day, as well as about 3,000 fans particpating in a recycling program. Other measures include compost-ing, purchasing carbon offsets and providing eco-friendly food vending and merchandise. A week after clean up, the parks and recreation depart-ment will conduct what it calls “post-event maintenance.”Ovalle said that the dou-bling in length is no cause for environmental concern.“We’ve got good turf crews,” Ovalle said. “The good thing about C3 is that they’ve always helped us return the park back to normal.”REVENUEcontinues from page 1most crowded in the early morning. Finally, for fans of tra-ditional Californian skater punk in the vein of De-scendents, check out the delightfully bratty FID-LAR. The band revels in irreverent and adrenaline-packed hits such as “Wake Bake Skate” or the already classic “Cheap Beer.” Its self-titled debut was re-leased earlier this year to critical acclaim and shows are always insane, usually featuring the band just drunk enough to func-tion as it shreds and whips the crowd up into a fren-zied mosh pit. Led by the enigmatic Zac Carper, FIDLAR is one band worth arriving early for.While ACL can some-times get a bad rap for leaning too hard toward radio-friendly indie rock or Americana, the festival de-livered this year with three of the most exciting young bands in punk rock. The Cure The men of The Cure may have aged, but their hair is just as lively as ever. The Cure’s hairstyle of choice is not quite an afro and not quite a mo-hawk. It looks like something that is probably achieved by the band sticking their fingers in electric sockets and hair-spraying it into place right be-fore they take the stage. Beauty is pain. But don’t worry about The Cure because according to them, boys don’t cry.Grimes Grimes’ setlist is not the only unpredictable factor at the Canadian electronic art-ist’s live performances. There is no telling what color Claire Boucher’s hair will be when she performs at this year’s ACL festival. It’s possible it could even change between week-ends. She is like the real-life version of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” charac-ter Clementine Kruczynski, whose trademark move is con-stantly dying her hair different vivid colors. Boucher’s hair has been orange, green, blue, pink, dark brown, platinum blonde and rainbow streaked. fun. It would be unfair to say the members of fun. are entirely to blame for the awful hipster haircut trend of shaven sides with a tall, fluffy top. But they definitely are not helping. This hairstyle looks like the army regulation cut they probably gave soliders during World War II. Paired with suspend-ers or skinny pants, it is an ob-vious hipster alert. Dawes Most members of Dawes look like any other folk rock band, with bedhead and a lit-tle scruff, maybe a plaid flan-nel shirt. But drummer Griffin Goldsmith has something spe-cial resembling a cloud resting on top of his head. Griffin’s dirty blonde almost-afro looks so soft you could take a nap in it. Even though he’ll be at the back of the stage, audience members from all distances will likely see his curly locks bouncing to the beat.

The conservancy, a solu-tion-oriented, science-based organization, is dedicated to protecting nature and conserv-ing land and water in various regions worldwide. Ranked as one of the world’s most ethi-cal companies in 2013 by the Ethisphere Institute, the con-servancy is an honest worker in the conservation space, ac-cording to Barbara Laing, di-rector of marketing and com-munications at The Nature Conservancy. For the past three years, the conservancy has had a booth at Austin City Limits where staff members inform visitors about the conservan-cy’s mission and work.“We get thousands of peo-ple at the festival who turn up at our booth, wanting to know more about the con-servancy,” Laing said. “We want more people to be in-volved. There is something in nature for everyone.” The Nature Conservancy has been involved in all 50 states and more than 35 coun-tries worldwide. In Austin, the conservancy works to maintain the Barton Creek Habitat Pre-serve. Its work in the preserve exists to protect the water qual-ity of the Barton Creek water-shed, which in turn protects the quality of the water that re-charges the popular swimming hole at Barton Springs.Across the street from Bar-ton Springs is Zilker Park, where Rick Kostecke, associ-ate director of conservation research and planning, said the The Nature Conservancy will have a booth during both weekends of this year’s festival.“Staff, including myself, will be at the booth to talk to folks and provide informa-tion about TNC’s mission and our work here in Texas — everything from freshwa-ter to Gulf of Mexico to land protection,” Kostecke said.Kostecke also said having a booth at ACL gives the con-servancy the opportunity to interact with a younger and more diverse audience — an audience that they would not have been able to reach by other, more traditional means. By Kritika Pramod Kulshrestha@kritika88Jarrid Denman/ Daily Texan StaffRick Kostecke, lead scientist for The Nature Conservancy, observes the 4,084-acre Barton Creek Habitat Preserve on Tuesday afternoon.Austin City Limits music festival is a visual feast. Col-lege students walk around Zilker Park in cutoffs and bikini tops, the Austin skyline stands out against the violet sunset in the evenings and headlining artists sport some outra-geous hair styles. The Daily Texan compiled a list of our favorite hair donned by singers and song-writers that you should be on the look out for this weekend.   HAIMThe middle part is hard to pull off for anyone. For HAIM, it is even more im-pressive as all three sisters part their long locks right down the middle. The look fits the ‘90s rock-influenced sounds created by Alana, Este and Danielle Haim, plus their drummer Dash Hut-ton. Maybe the group will influence your own festival fashions. Just check with an honest friend before trying the middle part for yourself. Photo courtesy of haimband.comThe Los Angeles-based band HAIM sports not one, but three middle parts. Check out their set and their hair at the AMD Stage on Saturday from 2-3 p.m.By Hannah Smothers  & Sarah Grace Sweeney @hannahsmothers_@sarahgrace317 HAIR page 8Between South By South-west, Chaos in Tejas, Fun Fun Fun Fest and weekly shows at clubs such as Red 7 or Mohawk, punk shows are as common in Austin as 5 p.m. traffic on Lamar Boulevard. And while Austin City Limits Music Festival is usu-ally lacking in punk bands, this year will feature three big punk acts in its lineup with Savages, Parquet Courts  and FIDLAR. Savages is an all female quartet from London, known for giving intense and electri-fying live performances. Its debut record, Silence Yourself, was released this past sum-mer and includes forceful and explosive hits including “Husbands” and “She Will.” The band has gained a repu-tation for adhering to a strict set of independent values, but has become memorable for its talent. Every member of the group is skilled, espe-cially the propulsive bassist Ayse Hassan and drummer Fay Milton, who might be one of the most brutal drum-mers in punk right now. Guitarist Gemma Thomp-son leads the band with a drive that echoes early Joy Division, and singer Jenny Beth brings it all together with her howls that all but force the listener into sub-mission. Even those who do not typically like punk rock would enjoy Savages.Parquet Courts is a punk rock band with Texas roots. Formed in Denton by An-drew Savage, Sean Yeaton and brothers Austin and Max Brown, the band found suc-cess after moving to Brooklyn and crafting some of the best indie punk of the past few years by stripping the music down to its basics. Echoing post-punk and indie-rock legends such as Television or Sonic Youth, the band cre-ates direct and hard-hitting rock with elements of jazz, all while featuring complex yet slightly detached lyrics in the vein of Pavement’s Stephen Malkmus. All these compari-sons ring true when listening to its fantastic second album Light Up Gold, released in August 2012. Parquet Courts are set to put out a fantastic new EP called Tally All The Things You Broke, which de-buted earlier this week on KVRX. They are also known for incredible live shows and are local favorites, so expect their stage to be one of the By David Sackllah@dsackllahBEES page XXDiverse hairdos on stage at ACLACL lineup includes room for punk bandsPUNK page 8GREEN page 8",
