Goldberg*Courts have long struggled to resolve the question of how far acommunity may go in exercising its power to treat minority mem-bers differently. Popular prejudice, \"community morality\" and in-vidious stereotypes repeatedly have had their day in court asjudges work to reconcile equal protection and privacy rights withtheir own attitudes about the place of people of color, women andgay people in society.1 In the early 1990s, the tension between theAmerican ideal of equality and the reality of human diversitystarkly emerged. A national wave of citizen-sponsored initiativesseeking to amend state constitutions and local charters to prohibitgovernments from protecting lesbian, gay and bisexual citizensfrom discrimination spread across the country.On November 3, 1992, the citizens of Colorado passed Amend-ment 2 to the Colorado constitution, a voter initiative promoted by* Staff Attorney, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, New York.I wish to thank the plaintiffs of Evans v. Romer, for their extraordinary personalcommitment to the struggle for lesbian and gay equality, the witnesses who offeredtheir time and expertise to developing the record in the case, and, of course, the tre-mendous team of lawyers, paralegals and administrative assistants who have all de-voted countless hours to the trial, the appeals and the politics of this litigation.Among the many people to be thanked are my Lambda Legal Defense colleagueMary Newcombe, Lambda's cooperating attorney Clyde Wadsworth, the ACLU'sMatt Coles, Bill Rubenstein and David Miller, Jean Dubofsky and her associates,Jeanne Winer, Gregory Eurich, Natalie Bocock-Turnage and others at Holland &Hart in Denver, and the Colorado Legal Initiatives Project. I am also grateful toElizabeth Bachman and the other editors of the Fordham Urban Law Journal fortheir editorial and research assistance. And, always, I thank my partner, Paula Ettel-brick, for her insight and support.1. See, e.g., Bradwell v.

The Amend-ment, which forbids any state or local government entity, includingschool districts, from prohibiting discrimination against lesbians,gay men or bisexuals, provides:Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches ordepartments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, mu-nicipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce anystatute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual,lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relation-ships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of, or entitle anyperson or class of persons to have or claim any minority status,quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.This Section of the Constitution shall be self-executing.This essay recounts the struggle that ensued following the pas-sage of Amendment 2. At the time of its passage, Amendment 2was one of several voter initiatives that appeared on the ballot invarious states.2 First made famous at a national level by Colo-rado's Amendment 2 and Oregon's Measure 9,3 these initiativeswere developed and promoted by organizations with radical rightwing affiliations.4 Radical right organizations sought support for2. In 1992, the most publicized anti-gay voter initiative campaigns took place inColorado, Oregon, and Maine. See, e.g., Timothy Egan, Anti-Gay Backlashes are on3 States' Ballots, N.Y. TIMES, Oct. 4, 1992, ยง 4, at 4. Since the 1992 elections, state-wide initiatives have been attempted in Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri,Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Movements have also sprouted in many local com-munities, including Cincinnati, OH, Lewiston, ME, Springfield, MO and Austin, TX.See, e.g., Jim Simon, Gay Rights Fight Takes National Stage - Conservative GroupsSee 'Clash of Two Belief Systems', SEATTLE TIMES, May 28, 1994, at B1.3. Both initiatives sought to prohibit passage of any legislation or policies pro-tecting lesbians, gay men and bisexuals from discrimination and repeal any such ex-isting laws. Additionally, Measure 9 would have declared homosexuality to be\"abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse.\" See Egan, supra note 2, at 4.4. While this Essay focuses on the legal consequences and justifications for Colo-rado's Amendment 2 presented at trial, a general understanding of the origins of thenational phenomenon of anti-gay initiatives is critical to assess the initiatives' goalsand the threat they pose.The radical right in the United States is grouped loosely within a national umbrellagroup, the Christian Coalition. It has a multi-pronged agenda that includes attacks onwomen's reproductive freedom, multicultural curricula, education about evolutionand sexuality in schools, as well as active opposition to laws against sexual orienta-tion-based discrimination. In addition, organizations affiliated with the radical rightpromote prayer in schools and school voucher programs that enable public schoolstudents to attend private parochial schools with state funding. Ultimately, many ofthese organizations aim to reduce or eliminate the constitutional separation of churchand state. See, e.g., Craig Hines, Campaign '94: Conversion in South Carolina; Ex-Dem Leader, Now GOP Hopeful, Wows Christian Right, Hous. CHRON., Sept. 4,1994, at A20 (describing the leading players of the religious right and their programs);David E. Anderson, Watchdog Group Looks to Right, Surveys Plans, ST. PETERS-105819941 THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS 1059their anti-gay rights campaigns by alternately highlighting religiousthemes, such as the Bible's alleged condemnation of homosexual-ity, with campaigns based on popular myths about gay people.They also appealed to a sentiment common among moderate vot-ers: while all citizens should enjoy equal rights, no single groupshould be afforded \"special rights.\"'5 Such an approach succeededin Colorado.The passage of Amendment 2 by a majority of Colorado votersawakened many lesbians and gay men across the country whoselast awareness of an anti-gay initiative campaign was Anita Bry-ant's 1977 movement to overturn a Dade County, Florida ordi-nance against sexual orientation discrimination.6 An otherwiselocal transgression of lesbian and gay civil rights took on additionalnational significance as a group of citizens brought suit in the Colo-rado District Court, challenging the constitutionality of Amend-ment 2.BURG TIMES, Jan. 16, 1993, at 6E (surveying the activities of a number of prominentreligious right groups).With the election of Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992, radical right organiza-tions lost much of the access to and support of the White House previously providedby the Reagan and Bush administrations. See, e.g., Larry B. Stammer, Religious Rightis Outside White House Looking In; Lobbying: After 12 Influential Years, Conserva-tives Meet Reversals. Some Expect Setbacks to Be Rallying Point, L.A. TIMES, Feb. 2,1993, at Al (describing the strategic adjustment made by the conservative right inresponse to Clinton election). Many organizations turned instead to local politics,including the initiative process at issue in this Essay.See generally, PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY, TEACHING FEAR: THE RELIGIOUSRIGHT'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST SEXUALITY EDUCATION (1994); PEOPLE FOR THEAMERICAN WAY, PROTECTING THE FREEDOM TO LEARN: A CITIZENS'S GUIDE(1989). For further information, organizations that track the agenda and activities ofthe radical right include: The Institute for First Amendment Studies, Great Barring-ton, MA; Political Research Associates, Cambridge, MA; and, People for the Ameri-can Way, Washington, D.C.5. The Colorado Amendment 2 campaign was successful largely because it cen-tered on the \"No Special Rights\" theme. By characterizing protection against sexualorientation discrimination as \"special rights\" for lesbians and gay men, the movementsucceeded in appealing to voters who cared little about homosexuality, but who held ageneral aversion to civil rights protections for any group. The misrepresentation ofcivil rights as protective laws which benefit only minority groups (hence the term\"special rights\") has long been used as a strategy to attack those laws. After thesuccess of the \"special rights\" rhetoric in Colorado, other state organizers used thesame strategy, having concluded that it is better to try for \"the 20-yard gain ratherthan the 100-yard touchdown every time.\" See Simon, supra note 2, at B1 (quotingDavid Welch, director of the Washington State Christian Coalition).6. See, e.g., John Donnelly, Colorado Gay Rights Battle Is a Test of Will, NewTactics, MIAMI HERALD, Jan. 10, 1993, at 1A (describing Bryant's \"Save Our Chil-dren\" crusade as the \"nadir\" of the gay rights movement).FORDHAM URBAN LAW JOURNAL [Vol. XXIUltimately, Colorado District Court Judge Jeffrey Bayless de-clared Amendment 2 unconstitutional and ordered a permanent in-junction to bar its enforcement.7 Still, for the historical record andthe benefit of future litigation in this area, it is critical that the storyof Amendment 2 be told. By examining the multifaceted issuesthat come into play as the majority of a community is pitted againsta minority of its members, we can move toward a greater under-standing of some driving forces behind the American politicalprocess.The following brief account is intended to provide a sense of thetrial's scope and tempo rather than its jurisprudential underpin-nings. Thousands of pages of transcripts provide ample materialfor future versions of this significant event.I. Outside the Courtroom: The National Response toAmendment 2While Amendment 2 subjected Colorado citizens most directlyto its impact, its shock waves reverberated around the country.Responding rapidly to the election's outcome, concerned citizensmounted a national boycott of Colorado. Endorsements emergedfrom a wide variety of people and organizations-from the en-tertainment industry to the American Public Health Association tothe U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities.8Many groups, recognizing that lesbians and gay men were not theonly ones threatened by Amendment 2, joined in the public out-rage and called for the provision's repeal. 9In addition to the calls for a boycott, advocates responded toAmendment 2's passage with concerted efforts to educate lesbians,gay men and other civil rights supporters on strategies for coun-7.

See Booth, Amendment 2 Boycott, supra note 8, at 14A. At the same time, theidea of a boycott was debated hotly in and outside of Colorado and gay communities.Some condemned the boycott as divisive while others objected to the boycott's puni-tive effects on those who opposed Amendment 2. See Michael Booth, Boycott MayDivide Gay Community, DENVER POST, Dec. 6, 1992, at 1C, 5C.Still others believed that supporters of gay and lesbian rights should not avoid Col-orado but rather flood the state, vocally, with their messages. See Michael Booth,Boycott Alternatives Discussed, DENVER POST, Dec. 7, 1992, at 1B, 4B.1060THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASStering a national spate of similar initiatives being unleashed by rad-ical right organizations under the Christian Coalition umbrella.' ยฐCommunity meetings, training programs and weekend strategy ses-sions proliferated as groups around the country prepared for bat-tles that lay ahead.Above all, it had become clear that gay rights had moved fullyinto the eye of the storm over \"community values.\" Indeed, theAmendment 2 campaign, and the litigation strategy mounted in theamendment defense, clearly illustrated the grand proportions ofthe radical right's strategy to dismantle civil rights protections andeviscerate the separation between church and state.\"II. Initiating the LitigationA. Preview: The Preliminary InjunctionBefore the trial of Amendment 2 finally commenced at 8:30 a.m.on Tuesday, October 12, 1993, in a Denver district court room, itwas difficult to imagine exactly what a trial of the anti-gay measurewould look like. Less than a year earlier, Lambda Legal Defenseand Education Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union andsome of Colorado's premier civil rights attorneys had been beforethe same judge, Jeffrey Bayless. At that time, we sought to enjoinColorado Governor Roy Romer and Attorney General Gale Nor-ton from enacting or enforcing Amendment 2 pending a trial onthe merits.' 2During those five days of the preliminary injunction hearing inmid-January 1993, a palpable tension filled the courtroom. Funda-mental constitutional rights-and the basic question of whetherlesbians, gay men, and bisexuals would remain full and equal Colo-rado citizens-were at issue. Late on the Friday afternoon of Janu-ary 15, Judge Bayless announced his decision to grant a preliminaryinjunction, ruling from the bench that the plaintiffs had met thenecessary burden to obtain a grant of preliminary injunction.13 Al-10. See supra note 4.11. See generally Suzanne Goldberg, Facing the Challenge: A Lawyer's Responseto Anti-Gay Initiatives, 55 OHIo ST. L.J. 665 (1994) (chronicling the author's exper-iences litigating against anti-gay initiatives).12. Evans v. Romer, No. 92 CV 7223, 1993 WL 19678 (Colo. Dist. Ct. Jan. 15,1993)(hereinafter \"Evans \").13. Id. at *12. The threshold for obtaining a grant of a preliminary injunction is ashowing that there is an urgent necessity for the injunction. Once that threshold ismet, the court must weigh six factors: whether the side seeking the injunction has areasonable probability of winning the case on the merits; whether there is a danger ofreal, immediate, and irreperable injury which would be prevented by a preliminary10611994]FORDHAM URBAN LAW JOURNAL [Vol. XXIternatively, waves of relief and elation as well as pain and anger,swept through the gay community in the courtroom as well asthroughout the state and the country.B. Prelude to Trial: The Colorado Supreme Court Ruling andThe State's BurdenBy the time of trial, the governing legal standard was set firmlyin place by the Colorado Supreme Court. In denying the state'sappeal of a preliminary injunction against Amendment 2's enact-ment or enforcement, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that themeasure left gay men, lesbians and bisexuals \"out of the politicalprocess through the denial of having an 'effective voice in the gov-ernmental affairs which substantially affect their lives.' \"14 Findingthat \"Amendment 2 singles out and prohibits this class of personsfrom seeking governmental action favorable to it and thus, fromparticipating equally in the political process,\" the Court held thatthe amendment could survive constitutional review only if it wasnarrowly drawn to achieve a compelling state interest.'5Although each side's burden was clear by the time of trial, withthe state having to identify and support a compelling interest, deci-sions about the direction of the litigation were not simple. Attor-neys preparing for trial debated the propriety of making certainarguments or pursuing particular evidentiary points. Among thoseopposing Amendment 2, for example, the question of whether andhow to address the origins of sexual orientation was a subject ofserious disagreement.1 6  Other strategy decisions, such as thestate's use of moral philosophers to justify the amendment as a rea-sonable expression of community morality, caused the trial toinjunction; whether there is an adequate remedy at law; whether a grant of prelimi-nary injunction would be in the public interest; whether the balance of the equitiesfavors the injunction; and whether the grant of injunction will preserve the status quountil the case is decided on the merits.

Moving to TrialLess than a year after the granting of the preliminary injunction,the challengers were back in court for a trial on the ultimate ques-tion posed by the Colorado Supreme Court: does the state have acompelling interest in enacting a constitutional amendment that re-stricts the political participation of its lesbian, gay and bisexualcitizens?During the back-and-forth of pre-trial briefing, the state outlinedthe justifications for Amendment 2 that it intended to present. Theproffered reasons reflected a significant shift from the pre-electioncampaign, during which Colorado Governor Romer publicly op-posed the amendment and many public officials distanced them-selves from the vitriolic anti-gay rhetoric of Colorado for FamilyValues (\"CFV\"), the primary sponsor of the voter initiative.' 7 Bythe time of trial, the state's position had begun to mirror CFV'scampaign strategy.A. The Opening ArgumentsThe state advanced six justifications for the discriminatoryamendment, arguing that Amendment 2: 1) deters factionalism; 2)preserves the integrity of the political process; 3) preserves thestate's ability to remedy discrimination against deserving groups; 4)prevents government from subsidizing the political objectives of aspecial interest group; 5) prevents interference with personal, fa-milial and religious privacy; and 6) promotes the physical and psy-chological well-being of children. 8Responding to each of these points in the opening argument,trial co-counsel Gregory Eurich identified the prejudice and irra-tional hostility against lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals reflected ineach of these justifications. He explained that the reasons ad-vanced were code words for the view that \"Amendment 2 is justi-fied because we don't like gays and lesbians.\"1 9 In response toreason number 6 - protection of children - he queried, \"Do you17.

Shortly after that, the Deputy Solicitor urged that gays are apolitically powerful class. To prove his point, Mr. Tymkovichbrought out a map of the United States with blue shading filling ineach state and municipality with laws barring sexual orientationdiscrimination. With only eight states and one hundred-odd mu-nicipalities having such protections, the skeletal blue spots con-veyed, if anything, the gross nature of the Deputy Solicitor'soverstatements.23B. The Plaintiffs' Arguments Against Amendment 21. The Politics of Anti-Discrimination LawsAs the first witness to testify against Amendment 2, DenverMayor Wellington Webb attested to society's interest in promotingequality and reducing discrimination.24 Rejecting the state's efforton cross examination to equate civil rights with special rights,Mayor Webb explained that civil rights protections have a positiveeffect on all citizens of Denver.25 Next, the plaintiffs called Le-Anna Ware, the Director of the Wisconsin Civil Rights Bureau.Ms. Ware testified that enforcement of Wisconsin's sexual orienta-20.

She told the courtthat from her vantage point, there is a definite need for protectionagainst sexual orientation-based discrimination28, and that as anAfrican-American woman, she felt strongly that such discrimina-tion should not be tolerated for any reason.292. A Lesbian and Gay History LessonUniversity of Chicago historian George Chauncey detailed alengthy history of discrimination against lesbians and gay men inthe United States, starting with colonial America and followingthrough to the then raging debate over gays and lesbians in themilitary.3ยฐ He highlighted for the court the historical trend of re-pression and pathologization of lesbians and gay men in Americansociety. 31 During cross-examination of Professor Chauncey, theState sought to minimize the history of repression of gay and les-bian Americans by contrasting it with the history of racism in theUnited States.32 In response, Professor Chauncey stated simplythat discrimination is not a contest, and reinforced his earlier testi-mony regarding extensive govenment-endorsed discrimination.3. Homo 101: A Psychological/Scientific StudyRichard Green, a psychiatry professor at University of Califor-nia, Los Angeles, who specializes in human sexuality andpsychosexual development in children, took the stand next. Dr.Green identified for the court the elements comprising sexual ori-entation, which include a sexual or erotic attraction or fantasy life,overt sexual behavior, and self-identification, and then testified26.

This secrecy results in augmentation of the disease.38 Inresponse to numerous questions on cross examination about \"thegay agenda,\" Dr. Conant explained again and again to the State'sattorney that AIDS is not a gay disease.39The next witness was Dr. Judd Marmor, the past president andlife fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, to explain hisrole in the process that produced the APA conclusion that homo-33.

Attemptingto challenge Dr. Green's testimony, the State's attorney pursued a line of questionsabout the sexuality of rats. Dr. Green explained repeatedly that one cannot drawdirect conclusive comparisons between the sexuality of rats and that of human beings.Finally, tripping over terminology that would be challenging to anyone not exper-ienced in research science, the State's attorney asked Dr. Green whether it was truethat gay men had reduced levels of \"testosterony?,\" a chemical that one reporternoted sounded suspiciously like a pizza topping. Lawyers for both parties along withreporters and others could be seen around the courtroom attempting to stifle theirlaughter in the midst of this most serious scientific discussion.

Explaining that religious teachings,4' ignorance,42and people's insecurity about their own sexuality 43 are all sourcesof homophobia, Dr. Marmor then debunked common myths thatfuel anti-gay attitudes such as the equation of homosexuality withpedophilia. 44 After informing the court that the American Psychi-atric Association, the American Psychological Association, theAmerican Medical Association and the American Bar Associationhave all condemned discrimination based upon sexual orientation,Dr. Marmor added that Amendment 2 promotes homophobia andinjures the psychological health and self-image of thousands ofmen and women with homosexual orientations.45Early morning on Day Three, the court and most of the attor-neys received a lesson in genetics from Dean Hamer, a leading re-searcher at the National Institutes of Health, who testified abouthis research on the influence of human genetics on sexual orienta-tion.46 Dr. Hamer told the court that his research has identified aportion of a gene that bears some link to male homosexuality. 47His cross-examiner also received a lesson. In response to questionsthat attempted to minimize the significance of the genetic studies,Dr. Hamer explained that while 99.9% of DNA is common to allhuman beings, 99% is also common to human beings and chimpan-zees.48 In other words, a seemingly small genetic difference mayhave a great influence.4.

The \"feeling thermometer\" is a test given by the scholars at theUniversity of Michigan Institue for Social Survey Research Center. The scholars askpersons to imagine a thermometer which measures the warmth or coldness they feelto certain groups of people. One hundred degrees is the highest temperature on thescale and zero degrees is the lowest. Lesbian and gay men belong to one of the fewgroups included in the survey about which more than 50% of persons feel coldlyabout. The only group receiving a lower overall average score in 1992 was that ofillegal aliens, but more persons placed lesbians and gay men at zero on the thermome-ter than illegal aliens. Id.52.

As supervisorfor much of the medical care in Colorado for children who haveexperienced sexual abuse and neglect, Dr. Jenny decided to re-search the question for herself.55 Her study, based on Coloradocases, found that 2 of 269 perpetrators were lesbians or gay men,and that heterosexual male family members of children were over100 times more likely than lesbians or gay men to molest chil-dren.56 On cross examination, Dr. Jenny told the state's attorney,\"[T]o say we're going to pass a state law to protect children, wemight as well pass a law against heterosexuals.

Title 7 and the Civil Rights TraditionToward the close of plaintiffs' case-in-chief, Yale law professorBurke Marshall, who served as assistant attorney general in chargeof the United States Civil Rights Division and was the chief drafterof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, testified eloquently byvideo deposition about the nature of discrimination.59 Accordingto Professor Marshall, civil rights protections bring those discrimi-nated against \"safely into the mainstream of American society\"and enable them \"to participate fully in the life of the UnitedStates, including its economic life.\" 6 When asked about the needfor protections against sexual orientation discrimination, ProfessorMarshall stated that lesbians, gay men and bisexuals experience\"rampant discrimination and... violent retaliation simply becauseof what they are\" all of which render them vulnerable as a group.6'He added that the purpose of anti-discrimination laws is to upset a54.

Moral Philosophy and Amendment 2?Anticipating the state's discussion of the attitudes of ancient so-cieties toward homosexuality and the role of morality in law, theplaintiffs called classics scholar Martha Nussbaum to the stand.66Testifying that in ancient Mediterranean societies homosexual acts\"took place with social approval, 67 Professor Nussbaum addedthat such information is relevant to contemporary society becauseit adds an historical perspective from Greek culture which in manyways remains respected today.68 She concluded that the attitudesof ancient Greeks regarding homosexuality leave us little basis forinterpreting the ancient texts to mean that homosexual relationssubvert family or society.6962.

As described by Nussbaum, Finnis ar-gued \"the [Pilatonic Aristotelian tradition of moral philosophy\" that the State has alegitimate public interest in discouraging all sexual acts not performed within mar-riage. Evans III.Nussbaum criticized Finnis for basing his opinion on weak translations of classicaltexts. Finnis relied on translations that were published when British and Americancultures promoted a high degree of shame with regard to homosexuality and aretherefore inaccurate in their reading of sexual attitudes in ancient times.

Amendment 2's Creators-Colorado for Family ValuesRepresenting the state's first line of Amendment 2's defense,Colorado for Family Values' founders-Colorado Springs used carsalesman Will Perkins, and his colleagues Tony Marco and KevinTebedo-took the stand to explain their motivation for introducingAmendment 2 in the state. Mr. Perkins told the court that \"theobjective of the homosexual proponent is to blend the gender issueto where ... it's not an important thing,\"70 adding that the poten-tial for group bathrooms 71 is one reason for his organization's in-tention \"to deny protected class status to ... homosexual[s]. ' 2 Inresponse to questions by Boulder attorney Jeanne Winer on cross-examination, Mr. Perkins admitted that he knew that the phrase\"No Special Rights ' 73 was not included in the actual text ofAmendment 2, but that CFV used the phrase anyway in promotionof the amendment to convince voters to support it.74 At the con-clusion of cross-examination, as Mr. Perkins admitted in responseto a series of questions that his strong views about the dangers ofhomosexuality did not stem from training in medicine or psychol-Aquinas based his views on ancient texts, \"[he] was well aware that he was using someof their contents for rather different religious purposes.\" Id. at 800.70.

Id. at 752 (recounting the hypothetical posed byPerkins to the superintendent).Perkins returned to the bathroom hypothetical in his testimony to assert that ifprotected status were granted on the basis of sexual orientation, lesbian and gay advo-cates would be able to demand group bathrooms to prohibit the discrimination inher-ent in supervising some bathrooms but not others.

Sensitive to Sensitivity TrainingApparently in another effort to demonstrate the political powerof lesbians and gay men, the State called to the witness stand PatRomero, Personnel Director for the Department of Education inColorado and active P-FLAG member. Ms. Romero had con-ducted work-place sensitivity trainings on gay, lesbian and bisexualissues prior to Amendment 2's passage. 2 7 She explained that thesetrainings were held to help all employees realize their full potentialby challenging discrimination in the work-place and to sensitizeworkers to the needs of clients, particularly lesbian and gay youthwho are at high risk of suicide.' 28 At the close of Ms. Romero'stestimony, the strategic decision to rely on Ms. Romero tostrengthen the State's case clearly backfired.

The Plaintiffs' RebuttalAlthough most of the state's arguments had been thoroughly ad-dressed during the case-in-chief, the plaintiffs called two witnessesat the close of the State's case to reaffirm that there is no rational,let alone compelling, justification for Colorado to limit the civilrights protections available to lesbians, gay men and bisexuals. Re-sponding to the State's argument that inclusion of sexual orienta-tion protections endangers the civil rights of racial and otherminorities, Joe Hicks, Executive Director of the Southern ChristianLeadership Conference in Los Angeles, affirmed that civil rightsprotections against sexual orientation discrimination strengthenthe rights of all people. 36 Supporting Mr. Hicks' point and chal-lenging Professor George's pronouncements on the role of moral-ity to justify discriminatory laws, Duke University Law Schoolprofessor Jerome Culp testified that \"if we can't fight social norms,we won't deal with the oppression that exists in America.' 37E.

ResolutionNearly two months after close of trial, the Colorado district courtruled that \"Amendment 2 is unconstitutional as being violative ofthe fundamental right of an identifiable group to participate in thepolitical process without being supported by a compelling state in-terest.' 14 1 The court held that of the six allegedly compelling inter-ests presented by the state, 42 only the promotion of religiousfreedom and the promotion of family privacy were actually com-pelling.143 As to those interests, however, the court concluded thatthe Amendment was not narrowly drawn to promote them \"in theleast restrictive manner possible.\"'1 44 As a result, the court ordereda permanent injunction against the enforcement of Amendment 2.The State appealed the decision, but in a point-by-point rejectionof the State's justifications for Amendment 2's discrimination, theColorado Supreme Court upheld the District Court's grant of apreliminary injunction. 45 The State immediately announced its in-tention to seek review of the ruling by the United States SupremeCourt.III. ConclusionThe trial of Amendment 2 represents a profound moment in thehistory of lesbians and gay men and American civil rights jurispru-dence. Lawyers, political scientists and historians will have tostruggle for some time to come to grips with what it means to put asegment of society on trial for its basic rights.138.

LEXIS 779 (Colo.Oct. 11, 1994).1080THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASSEven as the courtroom defeat of Amendment 2 took its impor-tant place in the string of litigation victories over anti-gay initia-tives, radical right groups were in the midst of mounting campaignsin nine states to place Amendment 2-like measures on November1994 ballots. 146 The clear message from the Colorado courts, aswell as courts in California and Cincinnati-that the anti-gay meas-ures violated fundamental constitutional rights of lesbian, gay andbisexual citizens' 47 -seemed to have little effect on the enthusiasmof initiative promoters. Still, the victory provided a critical affirma-tion to lesbians, gay men and others that a minority group cannotbe excised from constitutional protections at the majority's whim.The litigation served also as a backstop for Colorado civil rightsadvocates by enabling them to turn their attention to the all-impor-tant tasks of public education and organization on lesbian and gayissues and on civil rights issues generally.Still, as the trial of Amendment 2 has delineated, the underlyingtension between the community's desire to restrict those it despisesand the individual's desire to live freely and equally will remain achallenge, as it has been since the time of this country's founding.Ultimately, it is the hearts and minds of the public, not the courts,that hold the key to a peaceful resolution.146. The radical right organizations were largely unsuccessful in placing anti-gayinitiatives on state ballots in 1994. Of the nine attempts made, only two were success-ful. Initiative organizers in Arizona, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, and Wash-ington failed to obtain the requisite number of signatures necessary to gain a place onthe ballot. An initiative in Florida was ruled invalid in March 1994. Only Idaho andOregon voters will adress the issue in November. A tenth movement was expected inOhio, but never materialized.

Organizers in several states have prom-ised to place anti-gay initiatives on state and local ballots in coming years.147. Citizens for Responsible Behavior v. Superior Court, 2 Cal.
