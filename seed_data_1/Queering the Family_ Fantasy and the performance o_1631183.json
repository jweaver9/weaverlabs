    "fullText": "INCE, K.  \nQueering the Family: Fantasy and the performance of sexuality and gay relations in \nFrench cinema 1995-2000 \n \nPublished in \nStudies in French Cinema 2002, Vol 2(2), pp. 90-97 \n \n  \nAbstract \n \nThis paper looks in detail at the representation of sexuality in the family in three films of the \nmid to late 1990s, Balasko’s Gazon maudit, Berliner’s Ma Vie en rose, and Giusti’s Pourquoi \npas moi? Its double focus is the changing structure of the French family at the end of the \ntwentieth century, considered against key political developments such as the pacte civil de \nsolidarité (PaCS) of November 1999, and the cinematic fantasies in which these structural \nchanges are envisioned. Fable, fantasy or anti-realism mark the endings of Gazon maudit and \nPourquoi pas moi?, while sequences of childhood fantasy punctuate the entire length of Ma \nVie en rose. No particular theoretical approach to fantasy is preferred, but the conclusion of \nthe paper is that cinema may be a privileged cultural vehicle for politically enabling fantasy, \nand that the three films discussed demonstrate this where the French family is concerned. \nBiography \nKate Ince is Senior Lecturer in French Studies at the University of Birmingham. She has \nworked and published on Marguerite Duras and topics in critical and feminist theory, and co-\nedited books on women’s erotic writing (French Erotic Fiction, Berg 1996, with Alex \nHughes), Samuel Beckett (Samuel Beckett, Pearson 2000, with Jennifer Birkett), and \nMarguerite Duras (Duras, Femme du Siècle, Rodopi 2001, with Stella Harvey). She recently \npublished a book length study of the performance artist Orlan, Orlan, millennial female (Berg \n2000).

This followed a period of \npolitically affirmative gay cinema in the 1970s led by the GLH-PQ (Groupe de Libération \nHomosexuelle – Politique et Quotidien) and the collaboration between Lionel Soukaz and \nGuy Hocquenghem (Marshall 1998: 262-3), after which gay militancy once again \ndiminished. Central to the renaissance of homosexuality in French cinema has been the genre \nof the AIDS film, anticipated in Carax’s Mauvais Sang/The Night is Young of 1986 and \nfinding its fullest expression in Vecchiali’s Encore (1988), Collard’s Les Nuits fauves/Savage \nNights (1992), and other films of the early 1990s (Cairns 2000: 89, Rollet & Williams 1998: \n193-208).  Vital to any rapid historical sketch of French gay and queer cinematic sexualities \nsuch as this must be a recognition of the imbalance in the representation of gays and lesbians. \nIn their introduction to Gay Signatures: Gay and Lesbian Theory, Fiction and Film 1945-\n1995, Heathcote, Hughes and Williams set out how this imbalance is characteristic of French \ncultural production in general (Heathcote, Hughes and Williams 1998: 15-17), and cinema is \nno exception: only in Balasko’s Gazon maudit/French Twist (1995) has lesbianism reached a \nlarge cinema audience. In summary, then, although the quantity of French films dealing in \nrepresentations of non-heterosexual sexualities has come to be considerable, it is still \nimpossible to affirm the existence of a queer French cinema. Bill Marshall’s comparison of \nFrench to other national cinemas is telling: ‘The more positive images to be found in \nmainstream film were neither a way of placing gay desire dynamically in the forefront of a \npostmodernist cinema, as with Almodovar’s activities in post-Franco Spain, nor were they to \nbe challenged by a ‘New Queer Cinema’ in the Anglo-Saxon sense, which would \nprovocatively revel in the abject’ (Marshall 1998: 262). \n    Despite the absence of a current identified by critics and audiences as ‘queer French \ncinema’, two of the three films I shall look at here were highly successful, both critically and \ncommercially. Gazon maudit, whose international popularity and interest for anglophone film \ncriticism is now well known, was second in the ranking of entrées recorded at the French box \noffice in 1995 (Waldron 1995: 65). Despite disppointing audience figures when it opened in \nFrance and Belgium in 1997, Berliner’s Ma Vie en rose/My Life in Pink went on to notch up a \nhuge international success: by the end of March 1998 it had been released in 16 countries and \nearned more than $4 million in ticket sales, finding its biggest audiences in Switzerland \n(500,000 entries) and the UK, the film's third co-producing country after France and Belgium \n(Anon 1998: 27). Critically speaking, after a positive reception at Cannes in 1997, Ma Vie en \nrose 'became the darling of the 1997 festival circuit and carried off nearly every award there \nis: Best Film at Karlovy Vary, Seattle, Fort Lauderdale, Kiev; Best European Screenplay and \nBest Actress for Michèle Laroque at Fort Lauderdale; Audience Award at Sarajevo' (Anon \n1998: 27). The film achieved a first for a foreign-language film in the UK by opening the \n1997 Edinburgh Festival, and carried off the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Picture, although \nthis coup was unusually not followed up by an Oscar nomination in the same category. The \nthird film I shall consider here, Giusti’s Pourquoi pas moi?/Why not me? (1999) has not \nknown the same international success as Gazon maudit and Ma Vie en rose, although it has \nhad an international release in at least four countries outside France, been positively \nreviewed, and won awards at the Miami and Seattle Lesbian and Gay Film Festivals in 2000.1 \n                                                 \n1 In Miami Pourquoi pas moi? won an Audience Award and Jury Award for Best Fiction Feature, and in Seattle \nBest Lesbian Feature. Stéphane Giusti (b.1964) has directing or writing credits on seven TV movies and co-\nwriting credits on one cinema movie of 1997: since the success of Pourquoi pas moi? he has written and \ndirected a further cinema film (Bella ciao (2001)) that does not appear to have been as successful (Anon 2002). \n      My reason for selecting these three films, however, rather than any commercial or critical \nsuccess they have enjoyed, is that the family and its structure is an important theme in all \nthree of them. By the end of Gazon maudit, Laurent and Loli’s nuclear family has been \ntransformed and enlarged to include Marijo and her new baby. In Ma Vie en rose the Fabre \nfamily has not outwardly changed, but its members have gained in wisdom through the \ndivision and social exclusion they have undergone, while in Pourquoi pas moi? significant \nchanges have occurred to three of the narrative’s five families . The family in these films is \nimportant because it functions – as in a number of other recent films of which the most \nnotable is probably Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau’s Drôle de Félix (2000) – as a \nmetaphor for the state of the French nation. It can do this because the French Republican \nmodel of the family as institution exactly parallels the ‘assimilationist’ model of unity and \ndifference often observed at work in the discourse and practices of French national identity \n(Ezra 2000: 145-53). Differences are tolerated as long as they fit in: the French family, like \nthe French nation, is governed by a restrictive type of universalism that accepts difference \nonly as the individual difference of personhood. This is in contrast to the multi- or \npluriculturalism adopted as the model for social policy by most other European states. One \nstrand of my argument here will be based on the frequently made observation that the \nmulticulturalist model of society lacking in France more easily accommodates non-normative \ndifferences of sexuality and gender.2 In the films under scrutiny, however, the universalist \nconception of the family extends to incorporate gay and queer sexualities, and undergoes \ntelling changes in the process. The other issue I want to introduce and pursue is that of \nfantasy, which features in the narrative and/or mise en scène of all three films. Fantasy, I shall \nargue, may be playing a role in the transformations that have started to open up new political \npossibilities for queer and gay sexualities in France in recent years. \n                                                 \n2 The multiculturalist model is perhaps for this reason more open to a conception of personal identity different \n      I shall begin with and devote the main part of my analysis to Ma Vie en rose, whose \nnarrative runs as follows. The Fabre family throw a party for their neighbours in the bland, \ncomfortable, strikingly untypically French suburb south of Paris in which they have just \narrived, where Pierre, the father of the family, has a new job as a draughtsman. At a short \nmock ceremony at the party in which Pierre presents his 'tribu' to the guests, Ludovic, the \nyoungest child of Pierre and Hanna, appears from upstairs dressed as a 'princesse' (in a pink \nsatin-style dress with puffed sleeves and wearing his mother's earrings). Since Ludovic \narrives in response to Pierre's announcement of his eldest and sole daughter Zoe, the guests \nare temporarily confused, taking Ludo to be a girl, an embarrassment Pierre covers up by \nsaying that the youngest of his three sons is an accomplished practical joker. Actually far \nfrom a joke, this piece of cross-dressing is the first of four transvestite performances Ludovic \neffects in the main part of the film, meaning that Ma Vie en rose is structured around a \nsequence of transvestite acts that admirably bear out the imitative and performative \nconstitution of gender theorized by Judith Butler in Gender Trouble (1990). Ludovic's second \nperformance is a mock marriage ceremony carried out in play with his schoolfriend Jérôme, \nthe son of Pierre's boss Albert, a coincidence which is to have dire consequences for the \nFabres. Unaware of the tragic early death of Jérôme's sister, Ludovic dons one of her dresses \nto act out the wedding ceremony, causing Jérôme's mother Lisette to faint from the shock \ncaused by this innocent insensitivity and by seeing Jérôme about to 'kiss the bride'. Ludovic's \nthird performance, which takes his adamant and clearly articulated desire to be a girl into the \nrealm of fairy tale, involves his usurpation of the role of Snow White in the school play, to \nwhich end he locks his rival for Jérôme's affections, Sophie, into the backstage toilet. When \nJérôme dismounts from his white steed to kiss the sleeping Snow White, the veil comes away \n                                                                                                                                                        \nfrom that of Republican individual personhood, but this issue is beyond the scope of this article. \nfrom Ludovic's face, revealing his bold and determined prank to the entire assembled \naudience, following which the Fabres depart from the school amid hostile stares and silence. \nThis third performance brings conflict between the Fabre parents over Ludovic's transvestism \nto a head, with Pierre angrily insisting that his behaviour cease forthwith, while Hanna \ncontinues to tolerate it and encourage Ludovic during the sessions of psychotherapy she and \nPierre have started to attend with their son. Ludovic's fourth and decisive (for the family's \nfate) act of cross-dressing follows a turbulent episode in which he is bullied for his femininity \nby other boys at school, leading to a quasi- or acted attempted suicide in which he hides in \nthe domestic freezer. When Pierre offers Ludovic 'anything' in recompense for the lack of \nsympathy that contributed to this dramatic episode of self-harm, Ludo asks (to his father's \nrenewed anger) to be allowed to wear a skirt to the birthday party of Sophie, the schoolfriend \nfor whom he substituted himself in the school play. At the insistence of Ludovic's \nunconventional and free-thinking grandmother Elisabeth that Ludo be allowed to act out \ncompletely his fantasy of girlhood (her theory of fantasy is that this will 'cure' Ludovic of his \ntransgender desires), Ludo duly goes to Sophie's party wearing a kilt, but despite hypocritical \ntolerance by others at the party itself, this proves to be the final straw for the Fabres in the \nneighbourhood, as Pierre's visible failure to impose his paternal authority on his son leads to \nhim being sacked by Albert. After a period of torment for the family in which Hanna cracks \nand turns on Ludovic, his psychotherapy is terminated as a failure, and homophobic graffiti is \nscrawled on the family's garage door (the confusion in the film's diegesis between \ntransgenderism and homosexuality is striking and an aspect already noted by other \ncommentators), Ludovic's family finally symbolically punishes him by cutting short his \nprized girlish hairstyle. Ludovic rebels by going to live with his grandmother, but when \nPierre is successful in getting a new job in faraway Clermont Ferrand, Ludovic chooses to go \nwith them rather than stay with Elisabeth. \n    Fantasy is the motive force of Ludovic's transgender desire, although this is not identifiable \nas simply either conscious or unconscious (fantasy or phantasy, to use the conventional \npsychoanalytic orthography). Ludovic not only passionately wants to be a girl: he confidently \nbelieves that he will become one, one day. (This is best shown by the expression of \nunadulterated delight on his face when, after gaining a hazy idea from his sister Zoe of the \nlink between femininity and menstruation, he awakes one morning with stomach ache and \nimmediately concludes that his periods have started, and girlhood/womanhood has come \nupon him in the night.) The script and narrative of Ma Vie en rose make for highly \nconvincing emotional drama, but by far the most cinematically inventive episodes of the film \nare the sequences of Ludovic's fantasy that take place in the televisual funhouse world of \ndolls Pam and Ben, the French equivalents of Barbie and Ken. The theme tune of Pam and \nBen's TV show doubles the song by French chansonnière Zazie that plays over the film's \nintensely pink sequence of credits, graphics that are matched and developed in the interiors \nand landscapes Ludovic is fantasmatically transported into in the 'Pam and Ben' sequences of \nthe film. Pam and Ben's perfect, romance- and flower-filled technicolour universe is as \nheterosexually normative a world as can be dreamt, but ‘queered’ by means of its excessive, \ncoloured and kitschy aesthetic. This queerness is clearly associated with children’s \nimagination in the film: Ludovic’s fantasized Pam comes to his rescue in more than one \nepisode of family drama just as a fairy godmother would, and blows fairy dust that (for \nexample) encircles and confines potentially punishing adults. Pam is often shown in flight, \nseemingly a metaphor for the free-floating  power of (unrepressed?) desire associated with \nchildren’s fantasies. \n    Berliner's bold and very contemporary thematization of transvestite childhood in Ma Vie \nen rose can be read according to 1980s feminist psychoanalytic theory, according to which \nunconscious phantasy does not recognize the difference between masculine and feminine, and \nallows a mobility of subject positionings across sexual difference. Sue Thornham summarizes \narguments originally made by Freud, Mary Ann Doane and Constance Penley, ‘Identification \nin fantasy, then, is shifting, unconfined by boundaries of biological sex, cultural gender or \nsexual preference’(Thornham 1997: 95). The proponent of the importance of fantasy in Ma \nVie en rose, as mentioned above, is Ludovic's grandmother Elisabeth, or 'Grany', blonde, \ndynamic, independent and with a colourful past, as she reveals to her grandson in the scene \nwhere she shows him a music box given to her by a previous admirer. Here, Elisabeth \neffectively teaches Ludovic by example that it is ‘OK’ to fantasise (when she feels old, she \nsays, she closes her eyes, and makes the world her own). The scene is also a good illustration \nof the permeability of the boundaries of subjectivity where fantasy is concerned: it is \nElisabeth who announces how she gains access to her fantasy world, but what the film's \nspectators see is the scene in Ludovic's intensely coloured 'Pam and Ben' world, in which he \ncan wear dresses to his heart's content. In this fantasy world of ideal beauty, heterosexual \nnormativity and yet possibility for the performance of feminine sexual difference across \ngenders, the boundaries of subjectivity between Ludovic and his grandmother have broken \ndown. Fantasy continues to figure prominently in the plot of Ma Vie en rose: as previously \nmentioned, it is at Elisabeth's insistence that Ludovic is allowed to 'go through with his \nfantasy' by wearing a skirt to Sophie's birthday party. This has the opposite of the hoped-for \neffect, because it precipitates the Fabres' definitive exclusion from their community. (Ludovic \nhas already been expelled from school after a petition is sent by neighbourhood parents to the \nheadmaster, and directly after the episode Pierre is sacked by his right-wing, patriarchal and \nCatholic fundamentalist boss Albert.) The acting out of fantasy is therefore the key point of \nexcess and the transgression of social mores in Ma Vie en rose. \n    Fantasy is also crucial to the conclusion of Berliner’s film. More than one reviewer has \nalready declared this ending, in which Ludovic is finally forgiven by his parents for the \ndisruption his cross-dressing has caused to the family’s existence after Hanna comes to \nunderstand Ludovic's transgender desire by (in a further surrealistic fantasy sequence) \nclimbing a conveniently positioned ladder up an advertising billboard featuring Pam and Ben \nand 'falling' into Ludovic's fantasy world, to be unsatisfactorily inconclusive, since the later \ndevelopment of Ludovic’s sexuality – whether he will be a transvestite, transsexual or gay \nadult -  is not shown. Ending the film’s narrative at this point seems to me, however, to be a \nwise directorial decision by Berliner (perhaps also by the scriptwriter Chris van der Stappen), \nsince by so doing his film’s structure draws attention to the foreclosure of definitively \nconstructed sexual difference that characterizes queer sexuality.  Ludovic is only 7, and to \nshow subsequent transgressive behaviour or imaginings would have deprived Berliner’s film \nof its emphasis on the interrelationship of fantasy and childhood dramatized so convincingly \nby DuFresne’s performance and the ‘queer’ cinematic aesthetic that is its mise en scène. \n    In the very final shot of the film Pam is seen flying over the toytown roofs of suburbia and \nwinking defiantly, as if to announce that despite the film's arrested ending and as in the \ncinema of David Lynch, fantasy and sexuality still pervade middle class suburban existence, \nwaiting to erupt and disrupt lives in the same way as they have done to the Fabre family and \ntheir community. Her flight and wink are for and at the audience, a performance of the power \nof fantasy cinema can engage and sustain. So although Ma Vie en rose links fantasy to \nchildhood, it also suggests – both in the effects on Pierre and Hanna Fabre and with its final \nhint that Pam-inspired fantasies will not be absent from Ludovic’s later life – that fantasy has \na place and a role to fulfil in adulthood too. \n    Stéphane Giusti’s Pourquoi pas moi? is a very similar production to Ma Vie en rose where \ngenre is concerned, a comédie that doubles as meaningful social drama and refreshing \ncinematic entertainment. In the film, a group of  lesbian and gay twentysomethings who run a \npublishing house together in sun-drenched Catalonia decide to come out to their parents at a \nweekend house party organised by the mother of one of their number, Camille. Josepha \nd’Augères, Camille’s widowed mother, is up to this point the only parent who knows of and \naccepts her daughter’s homosexuality, including Camille’s three-year relationship with \nAriane. The other members of the younger generation of characters in the film are Eva \n(lesbian) and Nico (gay), who have shared a flat for four years, Tina (lesbian), a new recruit \nto the publishing company, and Lili, the company’s secretary and only straight member of the \ngroup. Although these five characters dominate the first half of the film’s narrative, their \ndecision to declare their homosexuality to their parents turns out to have more far-reaching \neffects among their parents’ generation than they could possibly have imagined. A theme of \nartistic performance links several of the parent characters: Nico’s mother is Sara Manuel, an \ninternationally famous chanteuse, and Eva’s father the charismatic bullfighter ‘El Rubbio’ \n(real name José), played by the ageing rock star Johnny Halliday. The parents of Lili go by \nthe real and performing names of ‘Diane et Tony’, singer and pianist respectively, but a very \ndifferent class of performer to Sara Manuel, since they play only at bals and fêtes populaires. \nIt is revealed early in the weekend house party that Diane and Sara performed together and \nwere lovers at a point in their careers preceding Diane’s marriage to the down-to-earth Tony, \nthe formation of their performing duo, and the birth of daughter Lili. \n    The prominence of performance as a theme of Pourquoi pas moi? stands in, even more  \nthan in Ma Vie en rose,  for the performative constitution of gender and identity. It is through \nthe act of singing together again after a separation of so many years that Diane and Sara \nrealise the strength of their attraction to each other, and decide to renew their lesbian affair. \nTony is initially heartbroken by being left by his wife, but by the end of the film is already \nplanning a new musical duo with a male singing partner - these newly queered performing \nrelationships suggest that where sexual/gender identity is concerned, life and performance are \ncoterminous. Perhaps even more important to the narrative of the film, however, are the \nchanges brought about to the five very different families involved. Nico’s single mother Sara \nhas started a lesbian relationship; Camille’s widowed mother has shared a bed with a married \nwoman (Ariane’s mother, who refuses to sleep with her husband when he refuses to \ncomprehend Ariane’s lesbianism as anything other than a curable genetic fault); Lili’s \nparents’ marriage has broken up, as apparently has that of Ariane’s parents, although the \npermanency of this is less certain. Of the film’s heterosexual couples, only Eva’s parents José \nand Malou are still together. A wholesale ‘queering’ of the family has occurred, which is \nreinforced by the new relationships forged by Eva (with Tina) and Nico (with Manuel, a new \nfellow-player in his sports team). There are strong elements of comic farce in the scenes in \nwhich all these partner-changes are played out, but seriousness too, particularly in the \ntemporary separation and re-uniting of Camille and Ariane.  \n    The very final scene of Pourquoi pas moi? is particularly suggestive as regards the family. \nIn it, Nico exits from the changing room in which he has declared to Manuel that he may be \nin love with him onto a sports pitch where a spangle-attired cabaret singer atop an illuminated \npodium draped with semi-naked dancers clad as angels/cherubs performs a love song called \n‘Crazy’. The scene’s décor and atmosphere are remarkably and excessively camp and \nsentimental. A high camera angle from the podium shows Nico break into a smile of pleasure \nand happiness (as it turns out, Manuel is indeed going to respond to his declaration of love). \nHowever, all the other characters from the turbulent weekend are also standing by, in their \nnewly configured partnerships, swaying to the music – an image of renewed unity it is \ndifficult not to interpret as an image of an expanded, 'queered' family. \n    I shall now return to the conclusion of Ma Vie en Rose, in order to compare it with the \nendings of Gazon maudit and Pourquoi pas moi? One reviewer of Ma Vie en rose called it ‘a \nterrifying film about the rejection of difference’.3 The acceptance and forgiveness shown \n                                                 \n3 Jeune cinéma 244 (Summer 1997), p.50, quoted in Cairns 2001:125. \ntowards Ludovic by his parents at the end of the film cannot palliate the wholesale rejection \nof him by the middle-class community in Mennecy, dominated as it is by normative nuclear \nand heterosexual families. Instead, I would suggest (having not been able to consult the \noriginal review, I’m not sure if this is what the reviewer was suggesting), Hanna and Pierre’s \nfinal ‘acceptance’ of Ludovic is actually a rejection dressed up as acceptance of his \ndifference. Hanna has understood the power of fantasy (and children’s consumer culture) in \nproducing Ludovic’s transgender desire, but what she says to him as she also seeks a \nconfirmation from him that he prefers real family life to the fantasy world of Pam is ‘you’ll \nalways be my child, whatever happens’, to which Pierre adds ‘our child’. Ludovic is accepted \nas a neutral, sexuality-free individual and member of the Fabre family, not as the sexually \ntroubled and troubling child he has been throughout the film. (It is of course true that \nfollowing the symbolic imposition of masculinity by his family’s punishment of him, his \ntransvestite performances have ceased, leaving Ludovic subdued and solitary, if not visibly \ndistressed.) The model of the family this implies is one of neutrality and individualism, in \nwhich the response to asserted difference such as Ludovic’s transvestism is tolerant \nrecognition (and even love) which cannot, however, bear to view Ludovic’s transvestism, and \nthe acting-out of fantasy it implies. \n    A comparison of the conclusion to Ma Vie en rose with the positive, upbeat endings of \nGazon maudit and Pourquoi pas moi? will clarify the reading of the French family I am \nmaking. In Gazon maudit, butch lesbian Marijo is readmitted to the heterosexual family of \nLaurent and Loli as she gives birth to the child conceived with Laurent in exchange for \nending her lesbian affair with Loli –  a chaotic period in the family’s life depicted in the main \npart of the film. In the film’s final scene an already improbable three-parents-plus-three-\nchildren family structure seems to spin off into the realms of fable when it is suggested that \nstereotypically philandering French male Laurent may be starting a homosexual affair with \nthe handsome gay Diego. Instead of being accepted, contained and neutralized, difference \nproliferates. The sexuality of every member of the family has been ‘queered’ at some point or \nfor some part of the film, and it is hard to imagine what sexual relations exist in the \ntransformed, extended family as it is presented to the audience, or how they can be reconciled \nwith one another. The domestic situation shown in Gazon maudit is not realistically \nsustainable, and a kind of fantasy inheres in the fable-like conclusion to the film. In Pourquoi \npas moi? fantasy also takes over the film’s final scene, although it is unclear whether the \ncabaret song on the sports pitch is of Nico’s imagining, a kind of collective fantasy of the \nnew queer family of young people and their parents, or a directorial whim. The closing \nimages supplied by Balasko’s and Giusti’s films both seem to be deliberately ephemeral, \nfantastic and anti-realist.  What I would like to suggest about these problematic endings to \nGazon maudit and Pourquoi pas moi? is that their fantasy may have a politically \nperformative force. Through the metaphor of the family, a change in the French State itself is \nbeing imagined and willed. This cinematic performativity can surely be historically related to \nthe fact that the PaCS - the pacte civil de solidiarité that allows gay (and straight) cohabiting \ncouples to register their union and benefit from rights equal to those of married couples - has \nbeen planned and come into force in the interval between the making of the two films (Cairns \n2000: 91). Importantly for both cinematically represented and real social French masculinity \nof this era, a question mark remains over paternal sexuality. In Gazon maudit Laurent is very \ndefinitely still the pater familias, but is shown as not unambiguously heterosexual. In \nPourquoi pas moi? only one father figure has not had his nuclear family transformed by the \nrevelations and shifts in relationships that occur in the film, and he is a torero, symbolically \nalso associated with art, performance and femininity. In the wake of the PaCS, is the \nassimilationist model of patriarchal familial identity I have identified in Ma Vie en rose going \nto change to something closer to the idealistic, fantastic endings of Gazon maudit and \nPourquoi pas moi?, and what future families might sexually different French men and \nwomen be able to aspire to? \nFilmography \nGazon maudit (Josiane Balasko, 1995) \nMa Vie en rose (Alain Berliner, 1997) \nPourquoi pas moi?

    "abstract": "This paper looks in detail at the representation of sexuality in the family in three films of the mid to late 1990s, Balasko’s Gazon maudit, Berliner’s Ma Vie en rose, and Giusti’s Pourquoi pas moi? Its double focus is the changing structure of the French family at the end of the twentieth century, considered against key political developments such as the pacte civil de solidarité (PaCS) of November 1999, and the cinematic fantasies in which these structural changes are envisioned. Fable, fantasy or anti-realism mark the endings of Gazon maudit and Pourquoi pas moi?, while sequences of childhood fantasy punctuate the entire length of Ma Vie en rose. No particular theoretical approach to fantasy is preferred, but the conclusion of the paper is that cinema may be a privileged cultural vehicle for politically enabling fantasy, and that the three films discussed demonstrate this where the French family is concerned",
