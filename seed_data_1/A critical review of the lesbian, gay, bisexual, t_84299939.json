The theme \nof the congress was Diversity in Harmony: \nInsights from Psychology. The International \nUnion of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) spon-\nsors the International Congress of Psychology \n(ICP) every four years. The ICP 2016 was a \ngreat success, bringing together a diverse set \nof international contributions. In a world of \ndivision, psychology and psychologists have the \nresponsibility to study and promote harmony \nacross different types of diversities, including \nracial, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender, and \nsexual diversity, among others. It is important \nto explicitly address the scientific contributions \nof psychologists who study gender and sexual \ndiversity because even in 2016, some local laws \npenalise gender and sexual minorities. For \ninstance, the latest report of the International \nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Asso-\nciation (ILGA) indicates that same-sex sexual \nacts remain illegal in 72 states (37 per cent of \nUnited Nation states) (ILGA & Carroll, 2016). \nDebunking myths and promoting a scien-\ntific understanding of sexuality and diversity is \none of the main responsibilities of psychologists. \nThus, the objective of this review is to summa-\nrise the contributions to the ICP 2016 about \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex \n(LGBTI) issues. To provide a comprehensive \noverview of the different activities, we reviewed \na total of 246 abstracts published in the Interna-\ntional Journal of Psychology issue for ICP (2016) \nunder the sections Sexuality, LGBTI (n=81) \n(‘Sexuality, LGBTI,’ 2016), Gender and Sexu-\nality (n=74) (‘Gender and Sexuality,’ 2016), \nand (‘Diversity,’ 2016) (n=91). Our selection \ncriteria were as follows. We included abstracts \nthat addressed L, G, B, T, or I issues, either \nindependently or in different combinations. \nWe also selected abstracts addressing Queer \n(Q) issues and issues such as androgyny or \n‘X-Gender’ (a Japanese term similar to gender-\nqueer). We extracted the information about \nthe country and continent of origin and the \nmain broad topic (e.g. Lesbian). When there \nwere several countries participating in a sympo-\nsium or thematic session, we classified the \nabstract based on the lead author’s affiliation. \nFollowing an initial screening, we retained all \nthe abstracts in the ‘Sexuality, LGBTI’ section, \n18 of the ‘Gender and Sexuality’ section, and \n12 of the ‘Diversity’ section, for a total of 111 \ncontributions. There was no overlap between \nthe abstracts, so that each abstract is part of \nonly one section. We present a summary of the \n‘LGBTI, Sexuality’ section and a combination \nof the other two sections separately.\nWe identified two invited addresses \nrelated to LGBTI issues. The first one was a \ndiscussion of social categorisations (including \n‘male’, ‘female’, ‘gay’, and ‘straight’) as not \nfitting all persons. The presenter suggested \nnew directions for psychological inquiry \n(Marecek, 2016). The second invited address \nfocused on the minority stress theory and \nresilience aspects to different areas of inter-\nvention, including legal aspects, educational \nstrategies, policy issues, community services, \nPsychology of Sexualities Review, Vol. 7, No. 2, Winter 2016 93\n31st International Congress of Psychology: Diversity in harmony\nand the provision of culturally relevant infor-\nmation (Meyer, 2016).\nThe ’Sexuality, LGBTI’ section included 13 \nsessions listed as contributed/invited symposia \nand thematic sessions (corresponding to a \ntotal of 50 presentations). LGBT issues (54 per \ncent) or LGBTI concerns (23 per cent) were \nthe main topics addressed. The lead authors’ \naffiliations were with organisations or universi-\nties in North America (62 per cent) or Asia \n(38 per cent). The range of topics included \npsychological associations supporting human \nrights (Schlittler & Anderson, 2016), LGBT \nmental health (Moreno, 2016), transgender \nhealth (Singh, 2016), LGBT parents (Sweeney, \n2016), and issues specific to LGBTI people \nin East Asia (Suen, 2016). With regard to the \npresentations within the symposia or thematic \nsessions, most of them corresponded to LGBT \n(29 per cent), transgender issues (19 per \ncent), gay (12 per cent), or LGB concerns (12 \nper cent). Contributions focusing specifically \non bisexuality (2 per cent) or lesbian concerns \n(4 per cent) were less frequently addressed. \nInterestingly, there were also contributions \nwith heterosexual samples focusing mainly \non attitudes toward LGBTI people or issues \n(8 per cent). Half of the presentations were \nfrom Asian authors (50 per cent), followed by \nauthors from North America (30 per cent), \nEurope (16 per cent) and Africa (4 per cent). \nThe content included the development and \nuse of professional practice guidelines on \nsexual and gender diversity for psychologists in \ndifferent countries (Jowett, 2016; Koch, Horne, \nAnderson & Schlittler, 2016; Victor, 2016), \npublic attitudes toward LGBT people in China \n(Shen & Chang, 2016), LGBT-targeted coun-\nselling and health services in Thailand (Ojanen \n& Ratanashevorn, 2016), the transgender \nexperience in Japan (Machida, 2016), lesbian \nmothers preparing their adolescents for homo-\nphobic stigmatisation in the Netherlands (Bos, \nVan Rijn-Van, Van De Bongardt & Gartrell, \n2016), the reshaping of heteronormativity in \nthe United Kingdom (Peel, 2016), the lives \nof Latino/a LGBT people (Heredia, Cerezo, \nAbreu & Aranda, 2016), and several health \nissues in LGBT people including smoking \n(Smith, Obasi & Reitzel, 2016), self-injury \n(dickey & Garza, 2016), suicide (Manalastas, \n2016), and risky sexual behaviour (Moreno & \nMcKerral, 2016).\nThe section corresponding to ‘Sexuality, \nLGBTI’ also included 31 individual oral and \nposter presentations. Of those, 68 per cent \ncorresponded to works from Asia, 19 per cent \ncame from Europe, and 13 per cent from \nNorth America. The main topics addressed \nfocused on transgender concerns (20 per \ncent), LG issues (19 per cent), LGBT (16 per \ncent), or LGB topics (13 per cent). Following \nthe same trend of the symposia and oral pres-\nentations, bisexual (3 per cent) or lesbian \nconcerns (3 per cent) were less frequently \naddressed. The main topics included loneli-\nness among rural gay and bisexual men in \nthe United States (Hubach, Li & Dodge, \n2016), the role of threat in sexual prejudice \nin the Netherlands (Mevissen, Schmitz, Pryor \n& Bos, 2016), the intersection of Jewish and \ntransgender identity in Hungary (Ritter, \n2016), attitudes towards bisexuals (Chen & \nChang, 2016), the positive effects of ‘coming \nout’ in friendships in Taiwan (Wang, Wu \n& Shih, 2016), the effect of social support \nto reduce depressive symptoms among \nLGB adults who experienced homophobic \nviolence in South Korea (Yi & Kim, 2016), \nthe positive effect of an inclusive school \nclimate on LGBT students in China (Wei & \nLiu, 2016), the results of a systematic review \nof LGBTQI studies in Korea (Lee & Kim, \n2016), and the contrasts in India ranging \nfrom the stigmatisation of LGBT people by \nhealthcare professionals (Satpathy, 2016) to \nthe community support leading to the elec-\ntion of a transgender mayor (Jain, 2016).\nWe also looked at 165 abstracts of pres-\nentations in the ‘Diversity’ and ‘Gender and \nSexuality’ sections, which we present together \nhere. In the ‘Diversity’ section, there was one \ncontributed symposium about the intersec-\ntionality frameworks in psychology (Rivera, \n2016) and one thematic session (May, 2016) \nthat gave only brief mention to LGB issues. \nWith both of these sections combined, session \ntopics focused on LGBT (50 per cent) or \n94 Psychology of Sexualities Review, Vol. 7, No. 2, Winter 2016\nReviewed by Alexander Moreno, Julie Koch & lore m. dickey\nLGB (50 per cent) issues. Lead presenters \nwere from North America (50 per cent), Asia \n(25 per cent), and Africa (25 per cent). One \ninvited symposium focused on gender and \nsexuality in India and China (Natu, 2016), \nwhile a thematic session focused on LGBT \nyouth minority stress and health research \n(Schrager, 2016). \nThere were 24 oral presentations, poster \npresentations, and presentations included \nwithin the broader symposia and thematic \nsessions. Of these, 33 per cent addressed \nLGB issues. Other presentations focused \nexclusively on sub-populations such as \ntransgender people (13 per cent) and gay \nmen (13 per cent). Presentations addressing \nexclusively LG (4 per cent), LB (4 per cent), \nand intersex issues (4 per cent) were under-\nrepresented. No presentations focused exclu-\nsively on lesbian or bisexual issues. Presenters \n \ncame from North America (46 per cent), \nAsia (33 per cent), Africa (13 per cent), and \nEurope (8 per cent). The presentations in \nthese sections represented a broad range \nof topics, from creative new ideas to LGBT \nissues in contexts/regions that are under-\nrepresented. For example, one presentation \nfocused on the queer economy in two urban \nareas of China (Liu, 2016). Another pres-\nentation introduced ‘Boys’ Love’ (Japanese \ncomics that highlight romantic relationships \nbetween male heroes) and why heterosexual \nwomen enjoy them (Song & Rong, 2016). \nOne poster presentation explored sexual \norientation and violence in family of origin \nand intimate partner relationships in Costa \nRica and Puerto Rico (Irizarry-robles, Serra-\ntaylor, Jimenez-chafey & Villafane-Santiago, \n2016).

AKTA provides \nservices to LGBT people and to those who \ndo not identify as LGBT. They provide \nprevention programming and education \nabout HIV, sexually transmitted illnesses, \nand sexual health. Additionally, IPsyNet \nheld an open meeting to invite psychological \norganisations around the world to actively \nget involved in their mission to increase the \nunderstanding of sexual orientation and \ngender diverse people and to promote their \nhuman rights and wellbeing (IPsyNet, 2016). \nThe great success of the LGBTI program-\nming at ICP was mainly due, among others, \nto the active role of IPsyNet in promoting \nLGBTI-related programming for the second \ntime at ICP. IPsyNet worked with the confer-\nence organisers, prepared a program of \nLGBTI-related presentations, and offered \ninternational students and researchers travel \nsupport awards to encourage LGBTI-related \nsubmissions.\nThis review has some limitations. It is \npossible that some other contributions were \nsubmitted under other topic sections (e.g. \nculture, aging, clinical psychology, counsel-\nling and psychotherapeutic interventions, \neducational and school psychology, ethics, \nfamily and community, general, harassment \nand trauma, health psychology, human rela-\ntionships, media and psychology, among \nothers). Rapid communications submitted \nto the ICP (at a later date than the initial \nsubmission deadline) were not published \nwith the other ICP abstracts in the Interna-\ntional Journal of Psychology (Issue 51; 2016) \nand are not included here. There was also an \nexclusive section with presentations in Japa-\nnese that we did not include in this review. \nFor that reason, we may have not captured all \nof the abstracts addressing LGBTI concerns. \nWe suggest future directions and recom-\nmendations for other psychological meetings. \nFor example, we hope that future presenta-\ntions will include topics that were under-\nrepresented in the 2016 ICP program, such \nas bisexual, lesbian, and intersex concerns. \nBased on the published abstracts and our \nown observations during the different pres-\nentations, research on transgender and \nbisexual parents, transgender men who \nbecome pregnant, miscarriage in lesbians \nand bisexual individuals, LGBTI older \nadults, and indigenous sexualities is still \nscarce. Those topics could be mentioned \nin future calls for abstracts. Also, we could \nnot find contributions with the lead authors \nbelonging to South America, Australia, or \nAfrican countries (aside from South Africa). \nThe Middle East region (Western region of \nAsia) was also underrepresented. It is impor-\ntant to promote the participation of these \nregions to provide a wider understanding of \nglobal LGBTI issues. Those countries face \nlocal challenges to promote LGBTI rights \nbut the Americas and Europe are the regions \nin the world where most of the progress \nachieved in the global fight for legal LGBTI \nequality has been concentrated (ILGA & \nCarroll, 2016). We encourage the organisers \nof ICP and other international psychological \nmeetings to create or maintain a section \nspecific to LGBTI-related programming. We \nalso recommend specifying in the guidelines \nfor submission how LGBTI psychology is \ndifferent from sexuality, gender, diversity, \nor culture. This will allow capturing and \nmapping LGBTI psychology in the future. \nMore general recommendations include the \nneed to create a journal to publish studies \non LGBTI psychology in Japan, the use of \ninformation and communication technolo-\ngies to reach wider audiences and deliver \nLGBTI educational materials, and the use of \nculturally appropriate materials to educate \non LGBTI concerns. Future directions might \nalso include looking at the experiences of \n96 Psychology of Sexualities Review, Vol. 7, No. 2, Winter 2016\nReviewed by Alexander Moreno, Julie Koch & lore m. dickey\nLGBTI people in international contexts \n(those who live, work, or study abroad from \ntheir nation of origin). From a public health \nperspective, we need more interventions \nto reduce disparities, to promote LGBTI \nhealth and to stop the targeted advertising \nof tobacco and alcohol to LGBTI people. To \npromote ethical practice, we should address \nthe increasing training needs regarding \nLGBTI affirmative therapy in Asia, the devel-\nopment or adaptation of practice guide-\nlines for psychologists working with LGBTI \nclients in more countries, the promotion \nof existing guidelines in countries that have \ndeveloped them (IPsyNet, 2016), and the \nbanning of conversion therapy. Psychology \nand psychologists must perform their profes-\nsional activities within a framework of \nthe respect of human rights. This human \nrights perspective, including LGBTI rights, \nclearly acknowledges the value of diversity \nand harmony as reflected in the theme and \nprogramming of the 2016 International \nCongress of Psychology.\nCorrespondence\nAlexander Moreno is a certified clinical \npsychologist/neuropsychologist member \nof the Order of Psychologists of Quebec \nin Canada.
