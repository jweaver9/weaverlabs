More specifically, this research examined the relationship between gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout, job satisfaction, and organizational support on the potential departure intentions of women coaches at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level.  Moreover, the data collected were analyzed to understand how these relationships differed by sport, race, and sexual orientation.  A total of 59.3% (n = 118) of respondents had considered leaving their coaching position within the last three years.  Burnout as well as a combination of job satisfaction and organizational support had a statistically significant relationship with departure intentions within a regression model. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are included.   iiiDEDICATION  I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my mom, Deidre Hutchins, who has always shown me what can be accomplished by giving 100% effort, remaining positive, and being resilient.  She has always led by example and has shown me that women are capable of anything.                                          ivACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I am incredibly grateful to the many people who have guided and supported me through this journey.

There has been a drastic decline in the percentage of women coaches at the collegiate level over the past 40 years (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  In the early 1970s, women coaches accounted for nearly 90% of those coaches in women’s sports; the most recent statistics, published in 2014, show that number dropped significantly to 43.4% (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  Women coaches face several obstacles while working in this field dominated by men (Estler & Nelson, 2005; Thelin, 2011).   Issues such as gender stereotyping (Rhode & Walker, 2008; Sartore & Cunningham, 2007), work-family conflict (Knight et al., 2015; Rhode & Walker, 2008), as well as burnout (Kamphoff, 2010; Pastore & Judd, 1993) have been reported for women in the profession of coaching. In my own experience, this research rings true.  As a woman working in the field of college athletics, I often find myself in the minority. I decided upon the topic for this dissertation while working as a women’s basketball coach at the small college level.  In 2016, our basketball team made it to the national tournament for the first time in school history, where we traveled to Pennsylvania along with 35 other teams from differing locations across the United States.  When I arrived at the coaches’ meeting prior to the tournament, I looked around and saw that every head coach in the room, aside from myself, was a man.  I sat perplexed, almost unable to focus, thinking to myself: Where are all the women?   Soon after that experience, I found myself in the History of Higher Education (HED 580) course at the University of Maine and as we began to cover the history of athletics, my eyes were truly opened to the changing landscape of collegiate athletics both before and after Title IX’s inception.  I can vividly recall seeing statistics while completing reading for a project in the    2course, notably that Acosta and Carpenter (2014) reported that after the passing of Title IX in 1972, the percentage of women coaches dropped from 90% to 46%.  These statistics fueled my interest and I began to dig deeper in my quest to understand the issue.  I chose to focus on the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III as it most closely resembles the level in which I had experience coaching while also having the largest percentage decline in women coaches of all three athletic divisions.  Moreover, when compared to the much larger NCAA Division I, a dearth of literature and research exists about Division III athletics and the people operating within them.  As I shifted out of my coaching role and into the role of athletic director, I wanted to understand why other women leave their positions as coaches.  From my own personal experience, I have seen women colleagues who have opted to leave the profession all together, or mirroring my own experience of taking on a role in administration.  I chose to focus my efforts on women coaches at the NCAA Division III due to its under-researched status and its philosophy of balancing both academics and athletics equally, one that reflects my own values as a professional.  Through developing a greater understanding of departure intentions of women coaches, my hope is to elicit change. A change not only for myself as an athletic director who oversees a coaching staff, but in a more generalized fashion for other NCAA Division III programs with a goal of building greater support systems that foster positive, inclusive climates for both men and women to successfully and equally hold the role of coach.   Research Questions The purpose of this study was to understand the factors influencing the potential departure decisions of women coaches and, in turn, to facilitate opportunity and suggestions for informed change.  In order to address the purpose of the study, the following research questions    3were utilized in the study: What is the relationship of gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout, job satisfaction, and organizational support on the potential departure of women coaches at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level? How do these factors differ by sport?  How do these factors differ by race?  How do these factors differ by sexual orientation? In the remainder of this chapter, I provide an overview of both the methodological and theoretical frameworks proposed for this study, followed by the methods as well as key terms, and concluding with a roadmap of the research study. Methodological and Theoretical Frameworks  A quantitative design was chosen for this study.  Through use of a survey, a nonexperimental design was created and applied to address the research questions (McMillan, & Schumacher, 2010).  This methodology was selected to examine relationships between women coaches at the NCAA Division III level and their intention to depart the coaching profession. More specifically, this research was grounded in a post-positivist paradigm.  Clear statistical data allowed for an opportunity to more fully understand the realities of the factors that influence the departure of women coaches.  A quantitative format enabled the opportunity to find statistical significance and relationships between the factors that influence departure. The theoretical framework used to guide this study was organizational support theory.  More specifically, Eisenberger et al.’s (1986) theory of perceived organizational support suggests “employees form global beliefs concerning the extent to which the organization values their contributions and care about their well-being” (p. 504).  Organizational support theory has been used frequently in research related to athletics inclusive of coaching performance (Rocha & Chelladurai, 2011), coaches’ work experience and job satisfaction (Dixon & Sagas, 2007; Kim &    4Cunningham, 2005), coaching burnout (Kilo & Hassmèn, 2016), and intentions to remain in a sports organization (Spoor & Hoye, 2013). Rhoades and Eisenberger’s (2002) meta-analysis of research driven by organizational support theory was used to understand the antecedents and consequences of perceived organizational support to more fully comprehend the factors that influence such support; the first of which relates to favorability of employees and the latter influencing employee’s commitment.  The data collection method for this quantitative study was an online, web-based survey.  An online platform was chosen for both cost and time efficiency.  Stratified random sampling was used to ensure an adequate sample existed to address the research questions.  Women coaches at both public and private NCAA Division III affiliated institutions throughout the United States were selected for participation in this study.  The sample accounted for head coaches varying by sport to assess any potential differences within the 21 sports with NCAA Division III championship offerings. In order to properly analyze the data, a binomial logistic regression, crosstabulations, an ANOVA, and independent t-tests were performed.   The use of these tests allowed for deeper understanding of multiple variables impacting the consideration to depart inclusive of organizational support, job satisfaction, gender stereotypes, work-family conflict, and burnout; more specially how these variables differ sport, by race, and by sexual orientation.  For this study, the dependent variable was departure, while the independent variables were job satisfaction, gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout, and perceived organizational support.  Using a binomial logistic regression provided an opportunity to understand potential relationships between the dependent and independent variables (McMillan, 2012).     5Terminology Throughout the following research study, the terms men and women as well as feminine and masculine are used frequently.  In delving further into the root of these terms, it is important to first define the meaning of the terms sex and gender and these two terms differ.  Heidari, Babor, De Castro, Tort, and Curno (2016) defined sex as biological traits “associated with physical and physiological features including chromosomes, gene expression, hormone function and reproductive/sexual anatomy” (p. 7).  The terms male, female, and intersex are normally associated with sex (American Psychological Association, 2012; Heidari et al., 2016; Johnson & Repta, 2012).  Gender, unlike sex, is socially constructed (Heidari et al., 2016).  “Gender refers to the attitudes, feelings, and behaviors that a given culture associates with a person’s biological sex” (American Psychological Association, 2012, p. 11). While gender can often be misunderstood as binary (e.g., man & woman), there are other terms within the scope of gender as gender actually exists along a spectrum (Heidari et al., 2016).  In relation to this particular study, the terms woman as well as transgender and non-binary/non-conforming are cited in the survey. “Gender influences how people perceive themselves and each other, how they behave and interact and the distribution of power and resources in society” (Heidari et al., 2016, p. 7).   Within the realm of gender also exists the components of gender expression, often expressed on a continuum from masculine to feminine.  While masculinity is often linked to men and femininity to women, both can be defined at their core as “behaviors, practices, and characteristics that can be taken up by anyone” (Johnson & Repta, 2012, p. 25).  More specific to this research study, women coaches may experience gender stereotyping, which places societal expectations on them to adhere to a more feminine leadership style where they are motherly or    6nurturing, while men coaches are expected to have a leadership style that lends itself to masculine traits such as power, aggression, and/or assertiveness (Bower et al., 2015; Koch et al., 2015; Rhode & Walker, 2008; Sartore & Cunningham, 2007). In this study, I utilized the terms of woman and women to refer to individuals who express feminine characteristics and man and men to refer to individuals expressing masculine characteristics, keeping largely in line with the literature I cite and the definitions they provide. Nevertheless, I do acknowledge that a larger range of gender expressions and sex identities exist beyond such binary definitions.  In this study, I also utilized terminology related to sexual orientation, including lesbian, gay man, heterosexual, asexual, bisexual, queer, and pansexual.  The term sexual orientation is defined as “a person’s sexual and emotional attraction to another person and the behavior and/or social affiliation that may result from this attraction” (American Psychological Association, 2015a, p. 862). The term lesbian refers to “a woman who is attracted to women” (American Psychological Association, 2020, p. 146), while the term gay is an inclusive term that can refer to a man or woman who is attracted to a person of the same gender identity (American Psychological Association, 2020).  Heterosexual refers to a person who is attracted “to a member of the other sex” (American Psychological Association, 2015b, p. 22).  Asexual refers to a person “who does not experience sexual attraction or has little interest in sexual activity (American Psychological Association, 2015b, p. 20).  Bisexual is a term to define when a person is attracted to “members of both sexes” (American Psychological Association, 2015b, p. 22)   Queer is a term “to describe a sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, that does not conform to dormant societal norms” (American Psychological Association, 2015b, p. 22). Pansexual refers to a person who “might describe their attraction to people as being inclusive of    7gender identity but not determined or delineated by gender identity” (American Psychological Association, 2020. p. 146). Roadmap In the next chapter, I provide an overview of the literature related to this study. Chapter four provides an overview of the methods used to conduct the study and its design. In chapter five, I present the results of the data analysis. Finally, in chapter five, the discussion of the results are presented along with implications for policy, practice, and future research.          8CHAPTER 2  LITERATURE REVIEW While Title IX was put in place in 1972 in order to level the playing field for athletics at educational institutions (cite), a gender imbalance among coaches at the collegiate level also resulted. Specifically, roughly 90% of the coaches of women’s collegiate athletic teams were women in 1972 but a little more than 40 years later, the representation of women coaches among women’s collegiate athletic teams has fallen to 43.4% (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014). Among coaches for men’s collegiate athletic teams, women’s representation continues to be only 2.0% (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014), thereby begging the question: Where are all the women coaches?   While some researchers have noted the rise in the number of new coaching positions being filled by men since 1972 (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014; Welch & Sigelman, 2007), others have found major obstacles for women in the world of collegiate athletics leading to their departure (Kamphoff, 2010; Kilty, 2006; Pastore & Judd, 1993).  Moreover, in athletic programs with a male athletic director, there are fewer women coaches (Kilty, 2006).  As of 2014, 4 out of 5 collegiate athletic directors were men, implying a greater likelihood of a man being hired in any open coaching positions (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014; Kilty, 2006). Whether viewing this issue from the perspective of women simply not filling these newly opened positions to coach women’s collegiate sports, or from the perspective of women leaving their positions all together, understanding the obstacles faced by women in the coaching profession is warranted.  In this chapter, I provide a brief history of women in athletics as well as the historical perspectives of women’s sports governed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and its respective divisions. Following the history, I review the current literature encompassing women coaches.  I then address themes within the literature surrounding departure    9including organizational culture, job satisfaction, as well as organizational support.  Next, I review the theoretical framework to be used within this study, followed by the conceptual framework.  Lastly, I summarize the chapter and end with the gaps in the current literature. History of Women’s Collegiate Athletics Much like other parts of higher education, there is a long-standing history of inequity related to women in the profession of collegiate athletics (Norman, 2012a; Suggs, 2006; Thelin, 2011).  Similar to the struggle women have had to fit into the male-dominated culture of collegiate life, the same has held for their experiences in athletics (Estler & Nelson, 2005; Thelin, 2011).  Early athletics were typically facilitated by and for the student population (Estler & Nelson, 2005; Thelin, 2011).  Since the population of students enrolled in higher education was historically dominated by men, athletic opportunity was readily available to this populace. While there were initially no formal coaches in college athletics (Thelin, 2011), by the early 1900s, institutions began hiring athletic directors and other professionals to oversee athletics (Thelin, 2011).  As time changed, so did the student population in higher education, bringing more women and more women’s colleges. As women became more interested in athletic activities, the formation of athletic clubs and “play days” were developed (Bell, 2007; Suggs, 2006).  There was pushback, however, due to the concern that being too athletic would be harmful to women’s bodies, especially during menstruation (Bell, 2007). While men were competing on teams in which there were opportunities to compete against other institutions, women’s opportunities were much more limited and informal, including competing against other groups of women within their own institution (Bell, 2007; Suggs, 2006). It was commonplace not only for other women to coach these groups, but for these women coaches to have a background in physical    10education and teaching (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014; Estler & Nelson, 2005; Suggs 2006).  These coaching positions for women’s sports were mostly volunteer positions, made up of approximately 90% women (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014; Bell 2007).   Women’s involvement in collegiate sports grew and, in 1957, the Division of Girls and Women in Sport (DGWS) revised their formal stance on women’s athletics, deeming that intercollegiate programming “may” occur (Bell, 2007).  This statement was soon adapted to show intercollegiate programming for women as “desirable” (Bell, 2007).  Due to the growing interest in women’s intercollegiate athletics, the DGWS saw the need for a governing organization to manage women’s sports.  This need eventually led to the appointment of the Commission of Intercollegiate Sports for Women (CISW); later renamed the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW; Bell, 2007; Suggs, 2006). The CIAW was soon replaced by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) in 1971 (Bell, 2007; Estler & Nelson, 2005). The AIAW began to promote national tournament opportunities for various women’s sport offerings (Welch & Sigelman, 2007). Perhaps the most impactful change for women seeking opportunity in the profession of collegiate athletics happened in 1972 with the passing of Title IX (Bell, 2007; Suggs, 2006).  Title IX states, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” (United States Department of Labor, n.d.).  After initial pushback regarding the application to college athletics, women student-athletes soon felt the positive impact with the rise of competitive women’s teams.  In the eight-year period after the passing of Title IX, the number of women’s teams per school went from 2.5 to over 5.6 (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014). According to the most recent statistical data, as of 2014,    11there were nearly 9,600 women’s intercollegiate teams giving opportunity for more than 200,000 women student-athletes (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).   The rise in women’s offerings since 1972 has grown by an average of more than six teams per school; beginning with an average of 2.5 women’s teams in 1972 to 8.83 teams per NCAA school in 2014 (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  Title IX has created more opportunities for women student-athletes to compete at a higher level as well as paid positions to coach those teams, ultimately making these coaching positions more appealing to both men and women (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014; Walker & Bopp, 2011; Welch & Sigelman, 2007).  Despite this interest by both men and women, as of 2014, men held 57.1% of the coaching positions for women’s sports as well as 98% of the coaching positions for men’s sports (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).   National Collegiate Athletic Association  As of 2019, the NCAA serves as the national governing body for 1,102 higher education institutions offering varsity sports (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-a, n.d.- b).  The NCAA is broken down into three divisions “to align like-minded campuses in the areas of philosophy, competition and opportunity” (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-d, para. 1).  The NCAA Division I is the most widely researched division, which may be attributed to a multitude of reasons including the largest average number of sport offerings (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014), the largest athletic budgets, or even the overall number of full-time students (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-a).  While the NCAA Division I boasts higher budgets and over triple the number of undergraduate enrollment, the NCAA Division III has the largest membership at 443 institutions.  NCAA Division I currently has 351 member institutions, while NCAA Division II has 308 (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-d).  Aside from    12representing the smallest number of member schools throughout the three divisions, NCAA Division II institutions can offer partial scholarships to their student-athletes, engage heavily in community service projects, and create balance between athletic competition and academic focus (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-g).  With the NCAA Division III boasting the largest membership of all three divisions, this size may also lend itself to impactful differences within member schools including institutional mission, public or private funding, as well as overall enrollment (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-d). The largest NCAA Division III affiliate has 25,725 undergraduate students while the smallest has just 285 (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-d).  Likewise, institutions differ between public and private, with 80% of NCAA Division III members being privately funded institutions (National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2019b).  These differences in enrollment, mission, as well as being public or private, may impact available resources, in turn influencing overall workload for coaches.    There are a variety of differences among the divisions as well; however, the most salient exists between Divisions I and III.  Schools with a Division I affiliation normally boast the largest overall student population (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-a), where roughly 1 in 25 students participate in athletics (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-d).  While the student population at NCAA Division III schools is smaller, nearly 1 in 6 students participate in athletics (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-d), making it the largest division in regard to the proportion of student-athletes (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-b).  Along with overall student population and student-athlete participation numbers, NCAA Divisions I and III differ in the overall philosophy in regard to student-experience.  At the    13NCAA Division I level, student-athletes are competing at the highest collegiate level, therefore both the athletic and academic responsibilities are held on equal ground (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-a). At the Division III level, however, it is very much a student-first mindset (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-b).  To this point, the NCAA Division III ensures student-athletes at this level have more time for academics by decreasing the length of athletic season as well as promoting competition within a geographic location that diminishes extended travel (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-b).    Additional differences between divisions are both the institutional type and the overall athletic budgets.  As of 2019, 65% of schools affiliated with the NCAA Division I were public universities, while 80% of schools affiliated with NCAA Division III were private (National Collegiate Athletic Association, (2019a-b). NCAA Division I schools administer larger budgets than Division III schools (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-a).  There are also scholarship opportunities available to student-athletes at the NCAA Division I level (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-a), whereas no student-athletes at the NCAA Division III level receive any financial assistance based upon athletic participation (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-e).    Another difference among divisions is often visible within the actual coaching job description itself. In sampling three job descriptions of various coaching positions currently available at differing institutions with NCAA Division III affiliation, many similarities exist within role and responsibility expectations.  Coaches were first and foremost responsible for teaching skills within their respective sports, planning and conducting practices, developing strategy for competition, recruiting and retaining student-athletes, coordinating team travel, managing a budget, monitoring academic progress, as well as ensuring compliance within their    14respective institution and to both their local and national conference affiliates (NCAA Market, 2019a, 2019b, 2019c).  Within the field of coaching, it is also common for coaches to take on additional responsibilities outside of their respective sport as a way to increase their salary (Kamphoff, 2010).  Women Coaches in the NCAA Considering the differences between the divisions, including student population, philosophies, and financial budgets (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-a, n.d.-b), it is not surprising that differences also exist in the percentages of women coaches at the different levels.  While much of the current research focuses on NCAA Division I, as of 2014, it was Division III that boasts the highest percentage of women coaches at 47.3 percent (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  NCAA Division III has the highest percentage of women coaches, as well as the largest decline in representation over a 30-year period; a drop of over 11% (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).    Major differences in the overall percentages of women coaches can be seen when broken down by sport.  As of 2014, field hockey boasted the highest percentage of women coaches across all three divisions; collectively making up 94.4% of field hockey coaches, while the sport with the least collective representation is track and field; where only 17.9% of women hold the position of head coach (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  More specifically at the NCAA Division III level, women head coaches are most underrepresented in the sports of skiing (11.1%), water polo (14.3%), and track and field (19.7%).  The three sports at the NCAA Division III level with the highest percentage of women coaches were field hockey (95.7%), lacrosse (86.7%), and softball (67.5%).  Out of these three sports, field hockey and softball are only offered to women.  Looking more generally across all sports at the NCAA Division III level, women make up less    15than half of the head coaches in 13 out of 19 sports (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  Table 1 shows the breakdown of women coaches by women’s sport in 2014 as reported by Acosta and Carpenter (2014).   While there is limited representation of women in the world of collegiate coaching, there is even less representation of racial diversity in the profession.  In the 2017-18 academic year, over 90% of women’s sports were coached by white coaches (Lapchick, Zimmerman, Coleman, Murphy, & Martin, 2019).  While NCAA Division I & II have seen slight increases in the percentage of African American coaches, the percentage in the NCAA Division III decreased in the 2017-2018 academic year (Lapchick et al., 2019).  In fact, it has been shown that African American assistant coaches are more likely than white assistant coaches to leave their profession (Cunningham, Sagas, & Ashley, 2001); potentially influencing the pool of head coaching candidates to be predominantly white.  Discrimination plays a key role in the decision for African American coaches to leave their position (Cunningham, 2010).  The lack of women of color in the coaching profession sheds a glaring light on how the intersectionality of race and gender can impact opportunity and experiences; especially in the role of coach at the collegiate level (Carter-Francique & Olushola, 2016).                   16Table 1. Percentage of Women Coaches by Women’s Sport in 2014 (NCAA).  (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014) The Importance of Women Coaches  Women coaches act in a vital role as mentors and role models to women student-athletes (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014; Norman, 2012a; Rhode & Walker, 2008); yet as of 2014, women held less than half of the coaching positions in collegiate women’s athletics (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014). For women student-athletes to properly navigate the complexities of participating at a high level of competition, it is important for them to form connections with    17women coaches who serve in leadership positions (Acosta & Carpenter 2014; Norman, 2012a; Rhode & Walker 2008).  This connection also supports future professional aspirations of women student-athletes to achieve leadership positions such as coaches; showing first-hand that women are valued and important in these roles (Norman, 2012a; Rhode & Walker 2008).  Not only do women coaches serve as important mentors to student-athletes, but they also serve as mentors to each other (Norman, 2012a; Rhode & Walker 2008). Women coaches help to develop a network of other women coaches to support each other and offer advice (Marshall, 2001; Norman, 2012a; Rhode & Walker 2008).  Through these networks, new women coaches can connect with senior coaches who may be able to share with them lessons learned for them to become more confident in an industry historically dominated by men (Marshall, 2001; Norman, 2012a).   Mentorship and networking are also areas where women coaches have been disadvantaged in the past (Kerr & Marshall, 2007; Rhode & Walker 2008). Men have been shown to have long-established networking relationships in the coaching field, giving an opportunity for information sharing and relationship building within the profession of coaching (Kerr & Marshall, 2007).  These networks are often referred to as the “old boys’ network,” in which men tend to be mentored and sponsored to advance into leadership positions, such as coaching, while women have traditionally not had the same opportunities (Bower, Hums, & Grappendorf, 2015). Mentoring relationships and networks can help women coaches navigate the complexities of the coaching profession (Marshall, 2001), including some of some of the most prevalent issues including gender stereotyping (Bower et al., 2015; Rhode & Walker, 2008; Sartore & Cunningham, 2007), work-family conflict (Dixon & Bruening, 2007; Kamphoff, 2010;    18Kilty, 2006; Welch & Sigelman, 2007), as well as burnout (Kamphoff, 2010; Pastore & Judd, 1993). I discuss each of these issues in turn below. Issues Facing Women Coaches Gender Stereotyping Women may be subjected to discriminatory behavior in a workplace that is male-dominated (Koch, D’Mello, & Sackett, 2015), including gender stereotyping. Koch et al. (2015) defined stereotype as “category-based traits or attributes that are often applied to a group of people as a result of accepted beliefs about the members of the group” (p. 129).  In order to situate this definition within the confines of gender, societal views may depict women as possessing feminine attributes, while men tend to be characterized as masculine in nature.  More specifically, when gender stereotyping occurs in the workplace setting, women leaders may be seen as motherly or nurturing, while it would be socially expected that a man lead with authority and power (Bower et al., 2015; Koch et al., 2015; Rhode & Walker, 2008; Sartore & Cunningham, 2007).  Gender stereotyping has been found as a specific challenge for women working in collegiate athletics (Bower et al., 2015). A socially constructed view of a competent coach or leader may place emphasis on masculine traits such as power, aggression, and/or assertiveness (Kerr & Marshall, 2007).  These perceived characteristics for a successful employee may either deter an athletic director from hiring a woman or, if hired, may set up a woman coach to feel the need to acclimate her coaching style to fit in (Theberge, 1993).  However, when women choose to coach with authority and assertiveness, they are either labeled lesbian or accused of trying to act like a man (Kilty, 2006).  Likewise, women coaches may feel as though they need to act in a certain feminine way to avoid being stereotyped as lesbian within a homophobic athletic culture    19(Kamphoff, 2010).  The simple interest of working in the profession of coaching can often times lead to the assumption of women’s sexual orientation (Norman, 2012b; Kamphoff, 2010).  Homophobia in college athletics may hinder opportunity for women in coaching, as societal norms paint an adverse picture of lesbian coaches (Kilty, 2006; Norman, 2012b). Homophobia has been indicated as a reason for lesbian coaches to leave the profession; more specifically due to the strong demands of needing to conceal their sexual orientation (Kamphoff, 2010). There may also be a prejudgment towards women in general in a leadership role, solely based on their gender (Bower et al., 2015; Burton, 2015; Norman, 2012b).  In cases where the athletic director is a man, there tend to be fewer women coaches on staff (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  Koch et al. (2015) found that “males, compared to females, tend to see male-dominated positions as more masculine or tend to adhere more strongly to gender stereotypes” (p. 139).  As of 2014, 77.7% of athletic directors were men, therefore making the chances of a woman coach less probable (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).   Work-Family Conflict Gender stereotyping can also serve as another obstacle for coaches in the form of work-family conflict (Bower et al., 2015; Bruening & Dixon, 2008). When it comes to balancing work and family, mothers are often stereotyped as being the primary caretaker for the children (Bruening & Dixon, 2008; Welch & Sigelman, 2007).  Societal views have painted a picture of a man out in the workforce while a woman would stay home, caring for a child (Bruening & Dixon, 2008; Welch & Sigelman, 2007). While the issue of work-life balance –  or the push and pull between responsibilities at work and those with family that often time-overlapping (Rhode & Walker, 2008) – can be difficult for both men and women coaches (Knight, Rodgers, Reade,    20Mrak, & Hall, 2015), women coaches are more apt to struggle with this issue, citing more difficulty spending time away from family (Kilty, 2006; Welch & Sigelman, 2007).   Working as a coach requires work hours that fall outside of a normal 9-5 workday, as nights and weekend work hours are expected as the norm (Bracken, 2009; Dixon & Bruening, 2007; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al., 2015). Many professions accommodate for working mothers to manage their family time in the evenings and weekends; however, with extended hours traveling for games as well as recruiting, women coaches are often disadvantaged when it comes to attempting to balance both roles (Dixon & Bruening, 2007; Kamphoff, 2010).  A typical workday for a head coach could range between 10-14 hours, depending on travel requirements, recruiting periods, as well as whether or not they are in season (Dixon & Bruening, 2007).  This extended time away from family and the need to balance both work and family could cause a copious amount of stress (Bracken, 2009; Kamphoff, 2010; Rhode & Walker, 2008)      Burnout  An overabundance of this kind of stress can lead to burnout (Tashman, Tenenbaum, & Eklund, 2010). Burnout has been found to be another struggle for women coaches, ultimately making it difficult for them to manage the complexities of coaching (Kamphoff, 2010; Pastore & Judd, 1993). Job burnout, as defined by Maslach, Schaufeli, and Leiter (2001), is “a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job” (p. 397).  Burnout encompasses three main areas of focus including exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment (Maslach et al., 2001; Pastore & Judd, 1993; Purvanova & Muros, 2010).  Researchers have found that women tend to cite higher effects of emotional exhaustion than men related to burnout (Maslach et al., 2001; Pastore & Judd, 1993; Purvanova & Muros, 2010).    21Specifically, in the field of coaching, burnout can also be caused by negative forms of stress that coaches experience within their profession (Frey, 2007). Major areas of stress for coaches can come with intense time demands (Frey, 2007; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al., 2015), pressure to win (Pastore & Judd, 1993; Theberge, 1993), balancing family obligations (Kilty, 2006; Kamphoff, 2010; Rhode & Walker, 2008; Knight et al., 2015; Welch & Sigelman, 2007), managing program finances (Welch & Sigelman, 2007), as well as perfectionism (Deuling & Burns, 2017; Tashman et al., 2010).   These stressors may lead coaches to feel that they have simply given all that they can to their team and that there is nothing left to provide (Kamphoff, 2010), ultimately leading to emotional exhaustion (Pastore & Judd, 1993).  Women coaches have been found to feel as though they have something to prove; often feeling the need to work harder than a man in the same position (Bower et al., 2015; Norman, 2010; Pastore, 1993; Rhode & Walker, 2008).  This constant state of pressure may ultimately lead to burnout, leaving a coach to feel as though they have given everything they can to their position (Kamphoff, 2010).   Women Coaches’ Departure Negative experiences such as gender stereotyping (Rhode & Walker, 2008; Sartore & Cunningham, 2007), a lack of work-life balance (Kilty, 2006; Welch & Sigelman, 2007), and burnout have been found to contribute to women coaches’ feelings of hardship within the field of collegiate coaching (Kamphoff, 2010).  Such sentiments can ultimately play a role in departure decisions (Ryan & Sagas, 2009).  When an employee decides to leave their job it, in turn, can cause issues for the organization (Cho, Johanson & Guchait, 2009; Ryan & Sagas, 2009).  With turnover comes a loss of productivity and experience as well as a financial burden placed on the organization at it seeks to hire and train a new employee (Hellman, 1997; Ryan & Sagas, 2009).     22For the athletic department, departure can mean a loss of productivity in time when having to find and train a new coach, as well as potential departure of student-athletes, loss of a quality program, and a period of adaption (Raedeke, Warren & Granzyk, 2002; Ryan & Sagas, 2009).  More specifically in relation to the representation of women in the field of intercollegiate coaching, when a woman leaves her job there may be a greater likelihood of a man being hired in the open coaching position (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014; Kilty, 2006).  For these reasons, it is important to understand the themes related to departure to ensure that proper procedures are in place to limit departure of quality coaches.  Of course, the decision to leave one’s position may culminate from a host of reasons; however, the overarching themes throughout the literature shed light on three major areas, including: (a) organizational culture, (b) job satisfaction, and (c) organizational support.   Organizational Culture  Organizational culture has been found to influence an employee’s intention to leave (Macintosh & Doherty, 2010).  Organizational culture, as defined by Schneider, Ehrhart, and Macey (2013), is “the shared basic assumptions, values, and beliefs that characterize a setting and are taught to newcomers as the proper way to think and feel” (p. 362).  In other words, culture influences the mindsets of those involved within the organization (Hartnell, Ou, & Kinicki, 2011), through a deeply rooted history (Schneider et al., 2013).  When organizational culture is not conducive to a supportive environment for all employees, it can have negative effects on an employee’s intention to remain in the organization (Macintosh & Doherty, 2010). In relation to collegiate athletics, the overall organizational culture stems from a long-standing history that favors masculinity in a variety of facets (Estler & Nelson, 2005; Theberge, 1993). This culture can be seen within historical artifacts of athletics, such as “ferocious”    23mascots (Thelin, 2011) as well as the uniforms worn in each sport (Rhode & Walker, 2008).  Keywords dominate the culture of athletics with masculine associations such as competition, aggression, domination, and grit (Kerr & Marshall, 2007).  The stereotypical vision of an athlete portrayed as muscular and agile is historically associated with the physique of a man (Rhode & Walker, 2008).  As such, it may become difficult for a woman coach to be deemed successful in a male-dominated culture (Theberge, 1993). The “old boys’ network” is another example of how an organizational culture may impact the potential departure of women in the work place (Rhode & Walker, 2008).  These long-standing and historical networks have been accepting of men and traditionally unavailable to women who were looking to advance professionally in the field of collegiate athletics (Rhode & Walker, 2008). Informal mentorship opportunities may add a greater prospect for men to advance, while these same networks have not developed for women (Rhode & Walker, 2008). Specifically, in athletics, the formation of an old boys’ network can enhance the feeling of marginalization for women, and at the same time place value, power, and camaraderie within circles of men (Theberge, 1993; Norman, 2010).  Being a part of a gendered group may also allow for greater access of both information and rank (McDonald, 2011). However, these networks have historically been accessible only to men, who continue to this day to hold the majority of all of the most influential positions in athletics (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014); ultimately leaving women at a disadvantage based on gender.   Job Satisfaction  Components of organizational culture can influence an employee’s satisfaction with their job (MacIntosh & Doherty, 2010), either positively or negatively.  Job satisfaction relates specifically to an employee’s mindset as related to the inner workings of their position (Hellman,    241997; Tooksoon, 2011).  In turn, when an employee is dissatisfied with their job, their intention to remain in that job may diminish (Cole & Bruch, 2006; Hellman, 1997; Herzberg, Mausner, & Snyderman, 1959; Jawahar & Hammasi, 2006; Moynihan & Pandey, 2007; Tooksoon, 2011).   Job satisfaction can be defined as an attitude which is “a positive or negative evaluative judgement one makes about one’s job or job situation” (Weiss, 2002, p. 175).  Likewise, Herzberg et al. (1959) classified job satisfaction as an attitude and advanced specific factors that lend themselves to employees having high job-attitudes inclusive of achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement, and salary. When employees have negative job attitudes, the effects are seen through performance, intention to stay in their position, mental health, interpersonal relationships, as well as their overall attitude (Hertzberg et al, 1959).  More specifically to women coaches, a major facet within the realm of job satisfaction resides in how their employer facilitates the balance of both work and family (Bruening & Dixon, 2008; Dixon & Sagas, 2007; Grady & McCarthy, 2008; Knight et al., 2015; Mainiero & Sullivan, 2005). Women, in particular, find themselves grappling with this balance between life and work at the midpoint of their careers and have been found more likely to make changes within their careers to better balance for family (Mainiero & Sullivan, 2005).  Flexibility within the position may help to ensure there is a balance between work and life as well as contribute to satisfaction in the women’s work experiences (Grady & McCarthy, 2008), especially when women are still expected to perform the majority of caretaking responsibilities in the home (Bruening & Dixon, 2008; Dixon & Sagas, 2007; Grady & McCarthy, 2008; Knight et al., 2015; Mainiero & Sullivan, 2005).      25Organizational Support  Another major theme surrounding the intent to depart includes the issue of employees feeling supported by their organization (Cho et al., 2009; Gardner, 2012; Jawahar & Hammasi, 2006; Knight et al., 2015).  When employees do not feel as though they are supported in areas such as equity, development opportunities, as well as advancement, they are likely to depart their position (Jawahar & Hammasi, 2006; Knight et al., 2015).   More specifically, if organizations are not taking steps to address harmful stereotypes and hierarchies, employees may feel as though they are not supported or valued within the organization (Jawahar & Hammasi, 2006).   In regard to women coaches, the lack of support by administration has been found to be a significant reason a coach would depart their position (Kamphoff, 2010).  Support within an athletic administration has been directly linked to a coach’s professional life as well as their life outside of work (Dixon & Sagas, 2007).  More specifically, effective organizational support influences a coaches’ satisfaction with their job (Kim & Cunningham, 2005). When there is a supportive culture within the athletic department, coaches are more satisfied with their jobs (Dixon & Sagas, 2007).  Likewise, organizational support, specifically in women’s sports, has been found to be a main factor in a woman accepting a coaching position at an institution (Bracken, 2009). When an organization does not show support for their coaches, the coaches can feel as if they are easily replaceable (Allen & Shaw, 2009).  Organizational support may also include support for motherhood, the administration’s outspoken valuing of women’s sports, and flexible work hours (Kamphoff, 2010). When coaches feel that the organization supports their familial obligations, this may decrease work-family conflict and in turn, may have a positive influence on their overall job satisfaction (Dixon & Sagas, 2007).  Another influential form of support for women coaches may come from the social    26support they receive from parents of student-athletes as well as the community (Knight et al., 2015; Myers, Vargas-Tonsing, & Feltz, 2005). Coaches also need to feel supported from their administration through their vision for the program. Fluctuation within upper administration and a consistent ebb and flow of expectations may result in frustration at the coaching level (Knight et al., 2015).  This lack of consistency also coincides with the coaches’ need to feel supported in dealing with difficult decisions related to their program (Knight et al., 2015).  Theoretical Framework Encompassing themes of organizational departure, culture, and job satisfaction, organizational support theory offers one way to understand the factors that may influence the departure of women coaches at the NCAA Division III level.  Organizational support theory has been utilized in numerous research studies within the realm of collegiate athletics including coaching performance (Rocha & Chelladurai, 2011), coaches’ work experience and job satisfaction (Dixon & Sagas, 2007; Kim & Cunningham, 2005), coaching burnout (Kilo & Hassmèn, 2016) and intentions to stay at a sports organization (Spoor & Hoye, 2014).   Within the area of organizational support theory, Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchinson, and Sowa (1986) introduced the idea of perceived organizational support in which “employees form global beliefs concerning the extent to which the organization values their contributions and care about their well-being” (p. 504).  Through use of organizational support theory, further insight regarding connections between employees and employers can be understood (Baran, Shanock, & Miller, 2012).  More specifically, employees see supervisors acting as representatives of the organization (Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002) and, in turn, employees believe their treatment is reflective of the assessment the organization places upon them as an employee (Eisenberger et al., 1986).  Ultimately, this treatment from an employee’s supervisors    27and coworkers influence their commitment to the organization (Eisenberger et al., 1986; Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002).   In sport organizations, perceptions of gender equitable human resource management practices from top level management were associated with perceived organizational support from both men and women working in upper management positions; and in turn influenced their decision to stay within their organization (Spoor & Hoye, 2014). More specifically related to college coaches, organizational support theory has shown direct impact on job satisfaction and a reduction in work-family conflict, which in turn may influence life satisfaction (Dixon & Sagas, 2007).  Likewise, Kim and Cunningham (2005) found a direct link between affective organizational support and job satisfaction in collegiate coaches; linking the affective side of support more so than the financial support.   Through a meta-analysis of research driven by organizational support theory, Rhoades and Eisenberger (2002) identified antecedents and consequences of perceived organizational support or POS.  Antecedents were the products from which employees perceive an organization treats them favorable, in turn enhancing POS; fairness, supervisor support, as well as organizational rewards and job conditions.  Within the area of fairness, both resource allocation and overall treatment of employees were core component of how fair treatment of employees could be assessed.  As related to supervisor support, Rhoades and Eisenberger (2002) likened the way that employees form views on how their organization supports their wellbeing to how employees feel as though their supervisors support and value them.  Within organizational rewards and job conditions, there are a variety of facets that influence an employee’s perception of support from their organization including recognition, pay, promotion, job security, autonomy, and role stressors, training, and organization size (Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002).      28Consequences were the areas related to outcomes of perceived organizational support, specifically influencing an employee’s organizational commitment, job-related affect, job involvement, performance, strains, desire to remain, and their withdrawal behavior (Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002).  Through the use of organizational support theory, there may be an opportunity to determine the influence of perceived organizational support in relation with some of the major obstacles for women’s coaches found throughout the review of the literature including gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, and burnout (Dixon & Bruening, 2007; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al, 2015; Sartore & Cunningham, 2008); thus, understanding how these factors may influence departure. Summary  In summary, there has been a drastic decline in the percentages of women coaches since the passing of Title IX in 1972; from 90% down to 43.4% as of 2014 (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  Along with this decline, there have been long-standing inequities for women within collegiate athletics (Norman, 2012a; Suggs, 2006).  Women coaches tend to face barriers including gender stereotyping (Rhode & Walker, 2008; Sartore & Cunningham, 2007), work-family conflict (Knight et al., 2015; Rhode & Walker, 2008), as well as burnout (Kamphoff, 2010; Pastore & Judd, 1993).  In relation to the literature on departure, common themes included organizational culture (Macintosh & Doherty, 2010), job satisfaction (Cole & Bruch, 2006; Hellman, 1997; Jawahar & Hammasi, 2006; Moynihan & Pandey, 2007; Tooksoon, 2011), and organizational support (Cho et al., 2009; Gardner, 2012; Jawahar & Hammasi, 2006; Knight et al., 2015).  Viewing the challenges of women coaches through the lens of organizational support theory is one way to understand potential departure intentions (Eisenberger et al., 1986).  Within    29this framework, a greater understanding can be gleaned of how treatment from an employee’s supervisors and coworkers influence their commitment to the organization (Eisenberger et al., 1986; Rhoades & Eisenberger, 2002).  More specifically related to sports organizations, organizational support theory may provide an opportunity to understand the influence of departmental support on major obstacles for women coaches found throughout the review of the literature including gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, and burnout (Dixon & Bruening, 2007; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al, 2015; Sartore & Cunningham, 2008) and how those factors may influence job satisfaction or departure.  While there exists much scholarship about the status of women coaches in collegiate athletics, several gaps in knowledge exist. The first major gap is the absence of research focused on the NCAA Division III level; specifically regarding the departure of coaches.  Most studies are focused on NCAA Division I, while other studies combine the three divisions together. With differing practice and season lengths, overall missions, budgets and pay, as well as travel schedules, the potential variances in experiences for coaches within these levels is clear.  More research is warranted to understand these differences.  Another gap includes differentiation of departure intentions by sport.  Some research has been more general, intending to be indicative of coaches and sports as whole, while other researchers have chosen to focus on specific sports such as basketball, volleyball, soccer, and swimming.  In order to fully understand the differences by sport at the NCAA Division III level, if any, more research is needed that differentiates among sports. In the next chapter, I present the overview of my study’s design with an eye toward addressing these gaps in the existing literature.      30CHAPTER 3  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY  This study was guided by the following research questions:  (1) What is the relationship of gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout, job satisfaction, and organizational support on the potential departure of women coaches at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA Division III level?  (2) How do these factors differ by sport?   (3) How do these factors differ by race?   (4) How do these factors differ by sexual orientation? In the following chapter, I address the methodology and research design for the research study.  I begin by highlighting the proposed methodological framework and its connection to the theoretical framework.  I then follow with an overview of the research design including the methods I employed, the instrument, sampling strategies, the selection of participants, as well as the distribution of the survey.  Next, I address how I analyzed the data.  After, I discuss ethical conduct of the research followed by the strategies for enhanced validity and reliability.  Lastly, I review the limitations of the research study. Methodological Choice and Rationale   The research design choice for this study was a quantitative design.  Through use of a survey, a nonexperimental design was created and applied to address the research questions (McMillan, & Schumacher, 2010).  A quantitative design was chosen in coordination with the foundation of a post-positivist paradigm (Ryan, 2006) as I was most interested in examining the relationships among the variables of gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout,    31organizational support, and job satisfaction on the departure intentions of women coaches. A quantitative design allowed for the opportunity to seek statistical significance and relationships between the factors that influence departure. In utilizing this quantitative design, the data obtained were more generalizable and indicative of the wider population of women coaches throughout the NCAA Division III (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  Methods of Data Collection     To explore these relationships, I utilized a survey design to collect data and sought to determine how these factors varied by sport as well as race and sexual orientation. This survey design consisted of an online, web-based survey for data collection. Surveys allow for an efficient means to reach a wide sample (Dillman, Smyth, & Christian, 2014).  More specifically, a web-based survey allowed for participation across the United States creating an opportunity for increased generalizability of data (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  With a vast majority of the population using the Internet, a web-based survey afforded the opportunity to engage a wide net sample (Dillman et al., 2014).  Using the design of survey research was also a cost-efficient way to disperse the survey and allowed for timely receipt of the survey to all participants (Dillman et al., 2014; McMillan, 2012).  Implementing a web-based survey allowed for a visually appealing resource that most respondents seemed to be able to navigate with minimum difficulty (McMillan, 2012).   Instrument  In order to address the research questions, the survey (see Appendix C) was comprised of six sections in which major themes throughout the research were addressed.  In line with the existing literature as presented in chapter 2, the survey included questions that measured the following themes as related to barriers for women coaches: (a) gender-related barriers, (b) work-   32family conflict, (c) burnout, (d) perceived organizational support, (e) job satisfaction, and (f) departure intentions as well as (g) demographics inclusive of gender, race, sexual orientation, institutional type, longevity coaching, marital status, and dependents.  Gender-related barriers were captured through use of a five-item scale created by Spoor and Hoye (2013) that reflected issues inclusive of old-boys’ club mentality, discrimination, as well as attitudes of colleagues.  Work-family conflict was assessed using an adapted version of the five-item work-family conflict scale developed by Netemeyer, Boles, and McMurrian (1996).  Burnout was addressed with a one-item scale that first provides the definition of burnout in relation to this research study; and then directly asked whether the coach has felt burnt-out within the past three years.  To capture data regarding perceived organizational support, an eight-item adapted version of the survey created by Eisenberger et al. (1986) was used.  Job satisfaction was assessed using two questions adapted from the University of Maine’s (UMaine’s) Climate Survey for Faculty (Gardner, Blackstone, & McCoy, 2011) covering areas such as salary, career achievement, recognition, workload, level of responsibility, departmental support, as well as institutional support.  Next, the survey assessed whether the respondents intended to stay at their institution using a question adapted from UMaine’s Climate Survey for Faculty (Gardner et al., 2011). Demographic information was asked at the end of the survey to gain information including gender identity, race, sexual orientation, dependents, marital status, length of time as a head coach, institutional type, as well as sport currently coached.   Survey Design and Participant Recruitment A recruitment email (see Appendix B) was sent with the survey link in the body of the email to all selected participants.  This email began with an invitation to participate in the research study.  To build rapport and trust with the intended respondents, information regarding    33my own role as an Athletic Director and former coach was included (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).   Next, the importance of the study and how their responses may serve as tools for recommendations were outlined.  The topics of anonymity, completion time, and opportunity to enter a raffle were addressed in the next paragraph.  The email concluded with the link to the survey and contact information for both the researcher and the faculty advisor (Dillman et al., 2014).  The incentive for completing this survey was an opportunity to enter a raffle to win one of two gift cards.  While incentives for electronic surveys can be more difficult to implement than in mail surveys, the use of incentives, specifically prepaid, easily redeemable incentives have been shown to improve response rates (Dillman et al., 2014).  The first screen of the survey included the informed consent (see Appendix A). Following that page, each of the six small-item scales were separated to their own page, to keep them grouped appropriately to allow the respondents to properly process the questions (Dillman et al., 2014).  The questions were placed strategically to ensure that respondents feel as comfortable as possible, beginning with the least sensitive questions moving to the potentially most sensitive questions (Dillman et al., 2014). The last page of the survey included a confirmation of completion, a thank you message to the responder for taking the time to complete the survey, as well as instructions on how to enter the raffle for the two Amazon gift cards (Dillman et al., 2014).  All but two questions in this survey used a Likert scale that allowed each participant to rank their level of agreement with the statements included; allowing for consistency throughout the survey to avoid any confusion for the respondent.  The additional two questions in the survey were open-ended questions.  Consistency within the visual layout of the survey was also used to ensure proper flow and to avoid any improper signals.  Lastly, there were navigation buttons at    34the bottom of each page, labeled next, back, and on the last page back and finish; allowing respondents to return to a previous page as well as move forward in the survey (Dillman et al., 2014). Participant Sampling As of 2020, the NCAA Division III is comprised of 449 member institutions, all of which offer women’s sports (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-b).  As of 2019, there were roughly 4,370 women’s teams at the NCAA Division III level and women coaches account for roughly 44.3% of coaches for women’s sports (Lapchick et al, 2019).  All women head coaches of women’s teams from NCAA Division III were identified and the process of stratified random sampling was used to select a sample for the study (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  Throughout the proposal process, I had anticipated being able to request a list of all NCAA Division III women head coaches of women’s sports from the NCAA research office.  After emailing for this request, I was made aware that the NCAA member institutions have not authorized the NCAA National Office to distribute contact information for their staff to outside researchers.  To achieve a full scope of the population, I downloaded the names of the 449 NCAA Division III affiliated member institutions and went to each of their athletic staff directories found on their websites and created a spreadsheet of all women head coaches of women’s sports by sport.  There are 21 championship sports in total at the NCAA Division III so I categorized by the following: basketball, bowling, cross country, field hockey, fencing, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, rifle, rowing, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming/diving, tennis, track and field (indoor and outdoor), beach volleyball, volleyball, and water polo.  All schools who offered indoor track and field also offered outdoor track and field; likewise, they utilized the same head coach for both sports so those two sports were combined in    35gathering total population.  This left a total of 20 sports for the total population to be sorted.  As of April 4, 2020, the breakdown of coach by sports was as follows in Table 2: Table 2. Number of Women Coaches by Sport as of April 2020. Basketball: 258 Golf: 48 Volleyball: 256 Ice Hockey: 32 Softball: 255 Rowing: 19 Lacrosse: 246 Gymnastics: 13 Soccer: 190 Bowling: 8 Field Hockey: 151 Skiing: 5 Tennis: 94 Beach Volleyball: 3 Cross Country: 91 Fencing: 3 Swimming/Diving: 66 Rifle: 2 Track and Field: 60 Water Polo: 2  Stratified random sampling was chosen to properly address the research questions. As of April 2020, there were a total of 1,802 women head coaches at the NCAA Division III level. Using a sample size calculator, based on a population size of 1,802, a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5%; a sample size of 317 was recommended (Qualtrics, n.d.).  This sample size allowed for divisions of subgroups based upon sport coached to ensure that the sample encompassed a wide range and lent itself to properly address the research questions (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  Keeping the research questions in mind, a nonproportional structure was used within this stratified random sampling to ensure that an adequate number of subjects were selected from each sport (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).    After categorizing the population, calculations were completed to determine how stratified random sampling would be performed. Sports such as water polo, rifle, fencing, beach volleyball, skiing, bowling, gymnastics, and rowing had such low numbers of women coaches that adjustments would need to be made when attempting to take an equal draw from each sport. Originally, with a calculated sample size of 317 and with 20 sports, 16 women coaches (rounded    36from 15.85) from each sport would be needed to account for the sample.  Seven of the sports had fewer than 16 women coaches: water polo, rifle, fencing, beach volleyball, skiing, bowling, and gymnastics. For these sports, then, the total number of coaches from each sport were selected, which provided a total of 36 women coaches.  This total of 36 was deducted from the sample size of 317; calculated out to 281.  The seven sports from which all the coaches were already sampled from were then deducted from the originally total number of 20 teams, leaving 13 remaining sports.  The remaining sample (281) was then divided by the remaining sports (13), which calculated to 21.61 (rounded to 22 women coaches).  To achieve the sample size of 317, a random selection of 22 women coaches were made from each of the remaining sports.  Unfortunately, with this larger per sport sample, that left the sport of rowing unable to meet the criterion with only 19 coaches. At this time, all rowing coaches were selected for the sample.  A selection of 22 coaches were made from the following sports: ice hockey, golf, track and field, swimming/diving, cross country, tennis, field hockey, soccer, lacrosse, softball, volleyball, and basketball.  A random number generator was found online and used to select the sample from each sport.  After randomly selecting the 22 coaches from the remaining teams, a total list of 319 coaches was compiled from the stratified random sampling. After completing three email requests of the first stratified random sampling, a secondary stratified random sample was needed to meet an appropriate response rate for the sample.  There were 12 sports remaining that had coaches in which had not been sampled.  The first round of sampling utilized all the women coaches in the sports of water polo, rifle, fencing, beach volleyball, skiing, bowling, and gymnastics.  With the remaining 12 sports, ice hockey only had 10 coaches who had yet to be contacted.  After including those 10 coaches, I randomly selected    3728 coaches from the remaining 11 sports.  While golf only had 27 remaining coaches who had not been previously contacted, the remaining 10 sports had enough remaining women coaches to use a random number generator to select 28 coaches per sport, thus accounting for a secondary stratified random sampling of exactly 317.  This second round of stratified random sampling was compared to the first round to ensure there were no duplicates from coaches listed twice due to their status of coaching more than one sport.  When no duplicates were found, the second sample was ready to receive the first recruitment email. Distribution Using the Qualtrics platform served as a timely and cost-effective way to follow up with potential participants who did not respond.  After the initial email was sent out on Tuesday, April 14th 2020 at 10:00a.m. (EST), five immediate responses were received including four “out of the office” automatic replies as well as one undeliverable address that was directed to the spam folder.  These automatic replies made the online survey platform more efficient than paper mail.  The initial email generated 70 recorded responses.  The follow-up email was sent out eight days after the original survey was sent out.  On Wednesday, April 22nd, 2020 at 10:00a.m., the Qualtrics platform was used to send out a reminder email that contained the same email language as the original, apart from an additional line at the beginning of the email that stated: “This is a friendly reminder that I am seeking your participation in a research study focused on women head coaches.  If you have already completed the survey, thank you and please disregard this message.” This follow-up email garnered another 30 total recorded responses. One final follow-up email was sent out 21 days after the original email that served as a last effort to gain data from the sample (Dillman et al., 2014; McMillan & Schumacher, 2010), which garnered another 24 responses.      38The online platform provided an ease of opportunity to send out a second level of a random stratified draw for additional respondents as the response rate from the initial pool did not meet response needed from this sample size.  After receiving a total of 124 recorded responses from this first round of the random stratified sample, a second draw was needed.  The first email for this second draw was sent out on Wednesday, May 6th, 2020 at 10:00a.m. and garnered and additional 69 responses.  Following the same timetables, a follow-up email was sent out on May 12th, 2020 at 10:00a.m., which brought in an additional 24 responses.  A final reminder was sent out to the sample on May 27th, 2020, yielding 14 responses for a total of 231 recorded responses.  A total of 636 emails were sent out to various NCAA Division III coaches with a total of 231 returned, yielding a 36% response rate.  The original sample size calculated for the study based upon a population size of 1,802, a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5%, was 317.  With a total of 231 returned responses, this accounted for 72.8% of the calculated sample size.  The 231 total responses accounted for 15.03% of the total population of women coaches at the Division III level as of April 2020. Methods of Data Analysis   To prepare for analysis, the data were exported from Qualtrics to SPSS.  All 231 recorded responses were uploaded to SPSS.  A total of 32 incomplete responses were removed from SPSS.  Of the 32 incomplete responses, 11 of them had only completed 3% of the survey, which equated to accepting the informed consent but not answering any questions. An additional 14 incomplete responses were removed for only completing 12% of the survey; equal to completing the first two questions.  Additionally, the last 8 incomplete responses out of 32 were removed; seven of which had completed 40% of the survey and one that had completed 61%.  Of all the incomplete responses, none had answered questions regarding departure or demographics; vital    39information to be able to address the research questions.  Ultimately, this left a remaining 199 total completed responses to be used in data analysis. I first employed descriptive statistics to the remaining 199 responses. The descriptive statistics provided key insights regarding the demographic make-up of the respondents. Demographic information regarding gender identity, race, sexual orientation, family responsibilities, marital status, length of time at institution, and institutional type was used in the analysis.  Likewise, a comparison of the data collected from coaches within the following NCAA Division III sports that offer national championship offerings as of 2019 was included in the analysis of the data: cross country, field hockey, soccer, volleyball, basketball, bowling, fencing, gymnastics, ice hockey, rifle, skiing, swimming and diving, indoor track and field, golf, lacrosse, rowing, softball, tennis, outdoor track and field, beach volleyball, and water polo (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-c).  Indoor and outdoor track and field were combined as all schools that offered indoor track and field had the same coach for outdoor track and field.   In relation to gender identity, 99.5% of respondents identified as a woman.  An additional 1% of respondents selected “prefer not to answer.”  Of the 199 respondents, 92.5% identified as white, 3% identified as “other,” 1.5% as Black or African American, 1% of respondents identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, an additional 1% identified as Asian, and another 1% with “prefer not to answer.”  When it came to sexual orientation, 77% of respondents identified as heterosexual, 16.1% as lesbian, 2.5% as bisexual, 1.5% selected “prefer not to answer,” 1% as gay, 0.5% as queer, and 0.5% as pansexual. These descriptive data are presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5 below.       40Table 3. Descriptive Statistics: Gender Identity.                Table 4. Descriptive Statistics: Race.

Of the 198 respondents to the question regarding marital status, 27.3% responded as single, 56.6% as married, 10.1% in a domestic partnership, 4.5% as divorced, 0.5% as widowed, and 1% selected “prefer not to answer.”  In relation to having dependents, of the 198 who responded to this question, 43.7% responded “yes,” 54.3% responded “no,” and 1.5% selected “prefer not to answer.”  The last question regarding demographic information was about institutional type.  All 199 respondents answered this question yielding 78.9% from private institutions, 20.1% from public, and 1% selected “prefer not to answer.” Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9  present each set of these statistics in turn below.

The highest response was by cross country coaches at 31 respondents (15.6%).  There was a total of 29 responses (14.6%) from coaches of track and field and 25 respondents (12.6%) from track and field (indoor).  The next highest representation came from swimming and diving with 24 respondents (12.1%). The sports of basketball, ice hockey, lacrosse each had 17 respondents (8.5%), respectively.  An additional 16 respondents (8.0%) noted coaching soccer, while 15 respondents (7.5%) marked softball and another 15 respondents (7.5%) marked golf.  Both field hockey and volleyball were represented with responses from 11 coaches (5.5%) each.  Row/crew and tennis coaches accounted for 9 responses (4.5%) each.  There were 4 respondents Table 7 Continued.     43(2.0%) who coached skiing and 3 respondents (1.5%) who coached gymnastics.  One respondent (0.5%) coached bowling and an additional one respondent (0.5%) coached fencing.  There were no respondents who noted coaching beach volleyball, rifle, or water polo.  A total of 199 coaches accounted for 255 head coaching positions total (see Table 10). Table 10.

It was determined that four items within organizational support needed to be reverse coded: (a) “When I put in extra effort, the people in my workplace fail to demonstrate appreciation,” (b) “The people in my workplace tend to ignore any complaint from me,” (c) “The people in my workplace show very little concern for me,” and (d) “Even when I do the best job possible, the organization fails to notice.” After reverse coding in SPSS, composite variables were created for the following variables: gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout, job satisfaction, and organizational support.  The composite variable for gender stereotype was created using the data from the question regarding barriers.  More specifically, the data from the following topics were utilized: lack of acceptance from colleagues, discrimination, patronizing attitudes of colleagues, boys’ club mentality, and homophobia.  To create the composite variable for work-family conflict, the data from the 5-item work family conflict scale was used. The composite variable for burnout was simply the one question that assessed burnout. To create the composite variable for job satisfaction, the data from the eight components of satisfaction were combined: general satisfaction, salary, career achievement, recognition for work, workload, level of responsibility, athletic department support, and institutional support.  Lastly, the composite variable for Table 10 Continued.    45organization support included the data gained from the eight-item scale addressing athletic department support.  To prepare the data for binomial logistic regression testing, it was imperative to first ensure appropriate assumptions were considered (Laerd Statistics, 2017).  The first assumption is that the dependent variable is dichotomous.  For this study, the dependent variable is consideration of departure in which respondents were asked to identify “yes” or “no” to whether they had considered leaving their head coaching position within the last three years.  There were four respondents who marked “prefer not to answer.”  For the purposes of meeting the dichotomous assumption, a new variable was created for departure to only include data from respondents who answered either “yes” or “no” to this question.  A new variable was created utilizing the answer “no” as label 1 and the answer “yes” as label 2.   After creating the new variable without respondents who answered “prefer not to answer,” this accounted for 194 cases to be analyzed using the binomial logistic regression. After identifying the dependent variable as dichotomous, the second assumption was assessed.  For this assumption, independent variables must be considered either continuous or nominal (Laerd Statistics, 2017).  In this case, the Likert scale items were categorized as scale rather than ordinal to meet the assumption need and considered as continuous.  These independent variables were coded as scale in SPSS.  To meet the third assumption, the data had both independence of observation and the dependent variable was mutually exclusive and exhaustive.  Regarding consideration for departure, respondents either had thought about leaving their position in the past three years or they had not, they would not be able to do both, which meets the assumption of independence of observation.  For assumption four, there is a minimum requirement of 15 cases per independent variable, which was met with 199 respondents.    46Assumptions five through seven involved assessing the fit of the data to the binomial logistic regression.  To do this, it was essential to determine three components: “(a) there should be a linear relationship between the continuous independent variables and the logit transformation of the dependent variable; (b) there should be no multicollinearity; and (c) there should be no significant outliers, leverage or influential points” (Laerd Statistics, 2017, p. 3).  To determine these components, natural log transformations were created for each independent variable.  While these independent variables were originally coded as ordinal, for the purposes of the binomial logistic regression, the variables were marked as categorical.  After computing the log transformations, the Box-Tidwell (1962) procedure was completed to test for linearity (Laerd Statistics, 2017).   The dependent variable of departure intentions along with the covariates inclusive of the five mean composite variables and a variation of these mean composites with the natural log transformations were used to run the Box-Tidwell (1962) procedure to test for linearity.  In Table 11 results from this procedure are shown.  To determine linearity, the p-value was recalculated by applying the Bonferroni correction through utilizing the number of terms in the model (Laerd Statistics, 2017; McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  For this test, there were 11 terms, inclusive of the five mean composite variables (job satisfaction, organizational support, gender stereotype, burnout, and work-family conflict) as well as the coordinating variation of each mean composite with the natural log transformations.  Lastly, there was also a constant variable.  The original alpha level was divided by the number of comparisons (0.05 ÷ 11 = 0.004545) to create an adjusted alpha level.  When comparing this new adjusted alpha level to the p values of the variables using natural log transformations, each p-value is greater than 0.004545, thus making each variable linear to the dependent variable.    47Table 11.

To test for outliers, a binary logistic regression was run with classification plots, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit, casewise listing of residuals, CI for Exp(B): 95%, and outliers outside of two standard deviations.  For predictive values, probabilities were selected.  After running the regression test, the casewise list reported six cases in which there were outliers.  The outliers had standardized residuals with values of -2.872, -2.872, 3.531, 5.764, 3.582, and -2.478, respectively. After close examination of each case, a determination was made to keep these responses in the analysis due to no apparent erroneous responses.    After final assessments were made to ensure data were ready for the binomial logistic regression, descriptive statistics were run to determine the frequencies.  Frequencies were run for each individual question to determine responses based upon the entire grouping.  Tables representing the frequencies can be found in Appendix F.        48To address the research questions, the data were then analyzed through a correlation to determine the relationship between the independent variables with departure.  Next, a binomial logistic regression was completed to determine the unique contributions of the independent variables on consideration of departure while controlling the other variables.  The use of statistics allowed for deeper understanding of the relationship of the multiple independent variables’ (organizational support, job satisfaction, gender stereotypes, work-family conflict, & burnout) impact on departure intentions.  In addressing the other research questions related to how race, sexual orientation, and individual sport, crosstabulations were run to first understand the differences in consideration to depart within these subgroups.  Then, t-tests and an ANOVA were run to determine if the factors that may influence departure differed within these subgroups.  T-tests were run for both race and sexual orientation, while an ANOVA was run for determining differences by sport.  Aside from the statistical data gathered there were also two open-ended questions included in the survey, one question addressed organizational support while the other addressed departure intentions.  To analyze these questions, the responses were extracted from the data set and coded to develop themes.  For the question regarding support, inductive coding was selected to enable themes to be generated specifically from the data itself; in turn, allowing these themes to later inform recommendations (McMullan & Schumacher, 2010).  When analyzing the question regarding departure, deductive coding was selected based upon the intent to utilize the open-ended questions to supplement the quantitative data collected.  The themes of organizational support, job satisfaction, burnout, gender, and work-family conflict were developed from the literature regarding departure and women coaches (Miles, Huberman & Saldana, 2014).      49Ethical Conduct of Research Due to the nature of the study incorporating human subjects, IRB approval was needed for the study.  The IRB application was submitted via email on Tuesday, March 3, 2020.  On Tuesday, March 17, 2020, the study was judged exempt from further review under Category 2 of the regulations with revisions.  Those revisions were made and resubmitted for final approval which occurred on March, 24, 2020.  One modification regarding how participants’ emails were obtained was made and submitted to IRB on April 9, 2020.  Final IRB approval (see Appendix E) was obtained on April 13, 2020.    Both ethical and honest measures were taken to ensure that all participants were protected as well as responses and personal information were kept anonymous.  Each participant was provided written documentation outlining their participation in the study as voluntary.  Informed consent was provided on the first page of the survey; however, information regarding anonymity of the survey was also provided in the recruitment email.  Informed consent covered areas of what participants would be asked to do, their risk, benefits, compensation, confidentiality, voluntary status of participation, as well as additional contact information of the researcher and faculty advisor (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  Participants needed to click “next” to give consent to move forward with the survey. Every attempt to prevent harm or risk was taken to ensure that all information obtained was kept completely anonymous.  Strategies for Enhanced Validity and Reliability   To both enhance validity and ensure reliability for this study, numerous measures were taken both at an internal and external level.  In the following section, I outline the measures taken regarding both validity and reliability, including researcher positionality, test validity, and panel review.  Finally, I address careful consideration taken when sampling participants.    50Researcher Positionality   To enhance validity, it was important to be clear on my positionality as a researcher regarding the topic of women’s coaches (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010), specifically because I work in the field of collegiate athletics.  I am a woman who has been working in the field of collegiate athletics for the past 10 years.  My experience in college athletics began as a student-athlete at a NCAA Division III affiliated institution where I competed on the track and field team for a year and half.  In my professional experience, I have worked in many roles including administrative assistant, staff associate, assistant athletic director, head women’s basketball coach, and athletic director.  I have recently left my coaching role to focus on my athletic director duties.  My experiences as a woman working as both an administrator and head coach in athletics has driven my interest in exploring women’s intent to depart the coaching profession.   Through recognition of my own personal experience and becoming more self-aware of my position regarding this research topic, my aim was to minimize bias in the selection of survey questions and all other areas of this research study. The use of predeveloped and validated scale systems helped to address researcher bias.  While a quantitative approach may have lent itself to reducing research bias during data analysis due to the statistical element of determining relationships between variables, clear and detailed accounts of decisions regarding selection of data analysis methods have been provided (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010). Test Validity In addition to researcher positionality, I also used test validity to enhance the overall validity of the study. A thorough review of the literature was done to ensure that inferences are both appropriate and valuable to the study (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  This literature review served as the foundation for creating the research questions and the selection of    51instrument to be used for data collection.  Major themes within the literature surrounding hardship for women coaches including gender stereotypes (Rhode & Walker, 2008; Sartore & Cunningham, 2007), work-family conflict (Knight et al., 2015; Rhode & Walker, 2008), and burnout (Kamphoff, 2010; Pastore & Judd, 1993), as well as themes within the literature on departure including organizational culture (Macintosh & Doherty, 2010), job satisfaction (Cole & Bruch, 2006; Hellman, 1997; Jawahar & Hammasi, 2006; Moynihan & Pandey, 2007; Tooksoon, 2011), and organizational support (Cho et al., 2009; Gardner, 2012; Jawahar & Hammasi, 2006; Knight et al., 2015). Taken together, these topics served as driving forces in the development of this research study.  In viewing these themes through the lens of Eisenberger et al.’s, (1986) theory of perceived organizational support, the aim of this study focused on understanding the factors that influence the consideration for departure of women coaches at the NCAA Division III level as well as how these factors vary by sport, by race, and by sexual orientation.  Panel Review Another measure to enhance the validity in this study was a review of the survey by a panel of small-college athletic staff (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  I selected a group of six respondents who were local women coaches and athletic administrators at the small-college level.  These reviewers were chosen due to their significant experience working at institutions with similar demographic make-up to institutions affiliated with the NCAA Division III.  Each of the respondents had differing athletic backgrounds and were located throughout three different states, which also mirrored the demographic of respondents I hoped to identify within the sample.  I conducted two phases of review with this group.  I first sent them a document with the survey and asked specifically for feedback regarding the content and order of the questions, word    52choice, and overall feel of the survey.  Using their feedback, I made changes to the survey inclusive of order and word choices.  Three weeks later, I emailed the same group an updated version of the survey.  This version included the recruitment email and informed consent.  The group was asked for their feedback regarding the ease of navigating the survey and any additional comments they had about formatting and structure.  The second round did not yield further recommendations for feedback and the survey was finalized. Sample In an effort to enhance external validity, stratified random sampling was used to ensure that participants from all sports at the NCAA Division III level were represented (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010), including coaches from institutions throughout the United States.  In turn, this participant group produced data, once analyzed, that were more generalizable to the coaching community at the NCAA Division III level.  With such a wide range both geographically and within sport, the goal was to find a participant sample diverse in numerous contexts (McMillan, 2012).    Limitations While all measures were taken to ensure reliability of the study, there were limitations inclusive of the online nature of the study.  Specifically, in relation to the data collection, there were limitations with using an online survey.  First, the responses were limited to those who had access to email and who frequently checked their email (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  In most instances, coaches are provided with an email address by their institution, which serves as a main tool in recruiting and communication with student-athletes.  However, with email communication becoming very popular in athletics, coaches have a large quantity, causing an emailed survey to get lost amongst other emails or discarded as spam.  There was a total of 10    53bounced emails total throughout the two different sample groupings.  The Qualtrics system did not provide information regarding unopened emails. The actual timing of the dissemination of the survey may have also served as a limitation. The survey was dispersed during the global pandemic of COVID-19.  During this time, there was a national “stay-at-home” order in which only positions deemed “essential” could report to work. After visiting all 449 NCAA member institution’s athletic websites and reading their COVID-19 announcements, it was clear that a majority of staff members in athletic departments were working remotely.  Coaches may not have been checking their emails as frequently or may have been inundated with the process of moving their work from an office setting to a virtual setting within their home.     The survey was sent out roughly a month after the NCAA announced the cancellation of all spring sports with an underlying uncertainly of when athletic competition would resume.  There is a potential that this timing could have impacted the state of mind of the coaches and were potentially impacted in the areas of organizational support, job satisfaction, burnout, work-family conflict, and gender stereotyping.    Another aspect of the online survey that may have provided a limitation was the nature of the questions regarding the intent to leave their profession, which may be a difficult topic for coaches to address and some coaches might have felt uncomfortable answering truthfully.  There was a total of 32 respondents who decided to not move forward with the survey.  Unfortunately, an online setting may not have been conducive to a sense of security that is essential for coaches to feel free to answer questions regarding departure in the most forthcoming way.  They were emailed using their work emails and this may have caused concern that the information could get back to their administration or even to their student-athletes.  It was clearly outlined that all    54survey responses were anonymous and in no way linked to their email address.  All possible measures were taken to address the security and confidentiality of the human subjects and this matter was specifically addressed in the both the recruitment email as well as the informed consent (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  With these limitations in mind, in the next chapter I present the results of the analyses I detailed previously.                                      55CHAPTER 4   FINDINGS  The purpose of this study was to understand the factors influencing the potential departure decisions of women coaches and, in turn, to facilitate opportunity and suggestions for informed change.    In this chapter, I review the results of the study.  I begin by highlighting descriptive statistics inclusive of job satisfaction, organizational support, barriers, work-family conflict, burnout and departure.  Next, I discuss results of correlation testing, followed by the results of the binomial logistic regression that examined the relationship between the independent variables (job satisfaction, organizational support, gender stereotyping, burnout, & work-family conflict) with the dependent variable (potential departure intentions). Lastly, I outline the findings from the two open-ended questions from the survey. Descriptive Statistics  As described in chapter 3, the sample for this study was selected through the process of stratified random sampling.  To determine the sample, I downloaded the names of the 449 NCAA Division III affiliated member institutions and went to each of their athletic staff directories found on their websites and created a spreadsheet of all women head coaches of women’s sports by sport; first identifying a stratified random sample of 319, followed by a secondary stratified random sample of 317.  These two samples yielded 231 respondents for the study; 199 of which were complete and utilized for data analysis. Job Satisfaction  Respondents were asked to rate their level of satisfaction; first, in general with the job, and then relating to the following categories: salary, career achievements, recognition, workload,    56responsibility, athletic department support, and institutional support.  The scale for this grouping of questions were coded (1) “extremely satisfied,” (2) “somewhat satisfied,” (3) “neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,” (4) “somewhat dissatisfied,” and (5) “extremely dissatisfied.”  The mean Likert score for general satisfaction within the job was 1.87 with a 0.72 standard deviation.  In relation to the other factors: salary (M = 2.81, SD = 1.16), career achievements (M = 2.09. SD = 0.81), recognition (M = 2.45, SD = 0.99), workload (M = 2.56, SD = 1.08), responsibility (M = 2.03, SD = 0.99), athletic department support (M = 2.25, SD = 1.22), and institutional support (M = 2.76, SD = 1.21), pointing to respondents being somewhat satisfied with the components of their position.  A low mean within 1-2 signified coaches were somewhere between extremely satisfied and somewhat satisfied.  The lower the mean, the more satisfied coaches were with a component of their position.  Within this dataset, coaches were the least satisfied with salary and institutional support; while they were most satisfied with their job in general (see Table 12).   Table 12. Descriptive Statistics: Job Satisfaction.    Number of Respondents Mean Likert Score Std. Deviation General 197 1.87 0.72 Salary 198 2.81 1.16 Career Achievement 197 2.09 0.81 Recognition 198 2.45 0.99 Workload 198 2.56 1.08 Responsibility 198 2.03 0.99 Athletic Depart. Support 198 2.25 1.22 Institutional Support 196 2.76 1.21   Organizational Support  In relation to the level of support felt from their athletic department, respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements focused on support.  This rating system was structured and coded as such: (1) “strongly agree,” (2) “somewhat agree,” (3) “neither agree    57nor disagree,” (4) “somewhat disagree,” and (5) “strongly disagree.”  Within this section, respondents were given eight statements as well as one open-ended question.  The statements were: (a) The people in my workplace value my contribution to the organization's well-being (M =2.03; SD =0.98), (b) When I put in extra effort, the people in my workplace fail to demonstrate appreciation (M = 3.08, SD = 1.12) , (c) The people in my workplace tend to ignore any complaint from me (M = 3.58; SD = 1.06), (d) The people in my workplace show very little concern for me (M =3.94, SD = 1.07), (e) The people in my workplace genuinely care about my well-being (M = 1.85, SD = 0.99), (f) The people in my workplace care about my general satisfaction at work (M = 2.41; SD = 1.01), (g) Even when I do the best job possible, the organization fails to notice (M = 3.51, SD = 1.20), and (h) The people in my workplace take pride in my accomplishments at work (M = 2.41, SD = 1.02). See Table 13 for an overview of these results. Lastly, respondents were asked: How could the people in your workplace better support you? Table 13. Descriptive Statistics: Organizational Support    Number of Respondents Mean Std. Deviation (a) Valuing Contributions  198 2.03 .984 (b) Notice extra effort 199 3.08 1.121 (c)Ignoring complaints 198 3.58 1.057 (d) Showing Concern 199 3.94 1.069 (e) Caring for Wellbeing 199 1.85 .944 (f) General Satisfaction 198 2.41 1.013 (g) Failing to Notice 199 3.51 1.201 (h)Pride in Accomplishment 199 2.41 1.020         58Gender Stereotyping Barriers  Respondents were also asked to indicate the extent to which the area of lack of acceptance from colleagues, discrimination, racism, patronizing attitudes of colleagues, boys’ club mentality, and homophobia served as barriers for them within their role of head coach.  Each response was coded numerically in SPSS as follows: (1) “not at all a barrier,” (7) “a barrier to a small extent,” (10) “a barrier to a moderate extent,” (11) “a barrier to a great extent,” (12) “a barrier to a very great extent.”  The descriptive statistics for these themes were as follows: lack of acceptance from colleagues (M = 3.85, SD = 3.69), discrimination (M = 4.30, SD = 3.77), racism (M = 1.79, SD = 2.37), patronizing attitudes of colleagues (M = 5.22, SD = 3.85), boys club mentality (M = 7.06, SD = 4.21), and homophobia (M = 2.50, SD = 3.08), indicating that these factors describing barriers were overall not a significant barrier for women coaches with the exception of the boys’ club mentality which represented a barrier to a small extent.  The lower the mean score within this section, the lower significance of a barrier faced.  Boys’ club mentality was the largest reported barrier for respondents, while racism served as the smallest barrier. See Table 14 for an overview of these results. Table 14. Descriptive Statistics: Gender Stereotyping Barriers.    Number of Respondents Mean Std. Deviation Lack of Acceptance (from colleagues)  199 3.85 3.69 Discrimination 198 4.30 3.77 Racism 199 1.79 2.37 Patronizing Attitudes (from colleagues) 199 5.22 3.85 Boys Club Mentality 199 7.06 4.21 Homophobia 199 2.50 3.08      59Work-Family Conflict  A total of five items were used to address work-family conflict.  Participants were asked to rate questions using the scale: (1) “strongly agree,” (2) “somewhat agree,” (3) “neither agree nor disagree,” (4) “somewhat disagree,” and (5) “strongly disagree.”  The statements to measure work-family conflict were: (a) The demands of my work interfere with my home and/or family life (M = 2.29, SD =1.12), (b) The amount of time my job takes up makes it difficult to fulfill family responsibilities (M = 2.49, SD =1.15), (c) Tasks I want to accomplish at home do not get done because of the demands of my job (M = 2.29, SD =1.14), (d) My job produces strain that makes it difficult to fulfill family duties (M = 2.58, SD =1.19), and (e) Due to work-related duties, I often have to make changes to my plans for family activities (M = 2.23, SD =1.16).  These low means ranging from 2.29 to 2.58 indicated that respondents fell somewhere between “somewhat agree” and “neither agree nor disagree” regarding the level of work-family conflict they experienced.   The lower the mean showed a stronger agreeance while a lower mean signified indifference.  Respondents had the strongest agreement with the question regarding work-related duties causing need to change family plans.  See Table 15 for an overview of these results. Table 15. Descriptive Statistics: Work-Family Conflict.    Number of Respondents Mean Std. Deviation (a) Interfering with Home  198 2.29 1.119 (b) Difficulty to Fulfill Responsibilities  199 2.49 1.145 (c)Tasks Do Not Get Done 199 2.29 1.140 (d) Produces Strain 199 2.58 1.186 (e) Need to Change Plans 199 2.23 1.162       60Burnout  An additional question in the survey addressed the topic of burnout.  Respondents were asked to select their level of agreement to the statement “In the past 3 years, I have felt burned-out from coaching.”  This rating system was structured as such: (1) “strongly agree,” (2) “somewhat agree,” (3) “neither agree nor disagree,” (4) “somewhat disagree,” and (5) “strongly disagree.”  There was a mean of 2.62 and a standard deviation of 1.35, pointing to respondents “somewhat agreeing” with feeling burnout.  Departure  When it came to the topic of departure, there was one question that addressed respondents’ intentions.  The question posed with “yes,” “no,” and “prefer not to answer” options, stated: “In the past 3 years, have you ever considered leaving your head coaching position?” A total of 118 respondents (59.3%) reported that they had considered leaving their head coaching position within the last three years.  While 77 respondents (38.7%) selected “no” whether they had made this consideration about leaving their position, an additional 4 respondents (2.0%) marked “prefer not to answer.”    Correlational Analysis  After these descriptive statistics were conducted, a correlational analysis was conducted to determine any possible relationship between the consideration of departure and the independent variables of job satisfaction, organizational support, gender stereotyping, burnout, and work-family conflict.   The correlation between consideration of departure and the following independent variables were all statistically significant (p<0.01): job satisfaction, organizational support, gender stereotype, burnout, and work-family conflict. See Table 16 for an overview of these statistics.    61Table 16. Correlation between Departure and Independent Variables.

Next, correlations were run with each independent variable to determine any overlap between measures. Job satisfaction and organizational support were the only two independent variables that were highly correlated.  As shown in Table 17, the Pearson’s correlation between these two variables was 0.71, meaning that there was a strong positive relationship between these two variables (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  For this reason, the composites for these two independent variables were combined prior to completing the binomial logistic regression to measure the overall job satisfaction including organizational support.      62Table 17. Correlation between Job Satisfaction and Organizational Support.                               Satisfaction   Support Satisfaction Mean Composite Pearson Correlation  1 .713**  Sig. (2-tailed)  .000  N 199 199     Support Mean Composite Pearson Correlation  .713**   Sig. (2-tailed) .000   N 199 199 **. Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).  Binomial Logistic Regression A binomial logistic regression was then conducted to understand the relationship between gender stereotyping, organizational support, job satisfaction, organizational support, burnout, and work-family conflict on potential departure intentions.  Linearity for the independent variables was evaluated using the Box-Tidwell (1962) procedure.  To determine linearity, the p-value was recalculated by applying the Bonferroni correction utilizing the 11 terms to create an adjusted alpha level of 0.004545 (Laerd Statistics, 2017; McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  Through this assessment, it was identified that all independent variables were linearly related to potential departure intentions. After testing for outliers, it was identified that there was a total of six standardized residuals.  The values of these standard deviations were: of -2.519, -3.153, 3.796, 4.965, 3.422, and -2.537 respectively.  After careful consideration, these outliers were kept in the analysis due to no apparent erroneous responses.   The logistic regression model was statistically significant, X 2 (4) = 96.34, p < .001.  The model explained 53.0% (Nagelkerke R squared) of the variance in potential departure intentions and classified 81.4% of the cases correctly.  Sensitivity was 88%, while specificity was 70.1%.  The positive predictive value was 81.7%; 100 x (103 ÷ (103+23), while the negative predictive value was 79.4%; 100 x (54 ÷ (54+14).  Both burnout and the combined variable of job    63satisfaction and organizational support were statistically significant within the regression model.  Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d suggesting a medium effect size for job satisfaction and organizational support (d = 0.569) and a medium to large effect size for burnout (d = -0.618).  Table 18 depicts the findings from the binomial logistic regression. Table 18.

Sport  Crosstabs were run to examine the initial relationship between departure and sport.  It is important to note that there were 30 head coaches who served as the head coach of more than one sport.  All coaches who served as the head coach for indoor track and field (n = 25) also coached outdoor track and field.  There were an additional four outdoor track and field coaches, who did not have indoor programs.  Additionally, 25 of the 31 respondents who coached cross    64country also coached outdoor track and field.  Of those 25, 23 of the respondents who coached cross country and outdoor track and field also coached indoor track and field.   Additionally, there were five other respondents who coached two sports outside of cross country and track and field. There was a total of 17 respondents who coached basketball and answered the question regarding departure.  A total of 52.9% (n = 9) of respondents who coached basketball responded that they have considered departing their position within the last three years, while 47.1% (n = 8) had not considered leaving. A total of 30 respondents identified as head coaches of cross country and answered the question regarding departure; 60% (n = 18) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 40% (n = 12) had not considered.   A total of 11 respondents identified as head coaches of field hockey and answered the question regarding departure; 45.5% (n = 5) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 54.5% (n = 6) had not considered.  A total of 14 respondents identified as head coaches of golf and answered the question regarding departure; 57.1% (n = 8) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 42.9% (n = 6) had not considered.   A total of 17 respondents identified as head coaches of ice hockey and answered the question regarding departure; 70.6% (n = 12) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 29.4% (n = 5) had not considered.  A total of 17 respondents identified as head coaches of lacrosse and answered the question regarding departure; 58.8% (n = 10) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 41.2% (n = 7) had not considered.      65A total of 16 respondents identified as head coaches of soccer and answered the question regarding departure; 75% (n = 12) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 25% (n = 4) had not considered.  A total of 23 respondents identified as head coaches of swimming/diving and answered the question regarding departure; 60.9% (n = 14) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 39.1% (n = 9) had not considered.   A total of 29 respondents identified as head coaches of track and field (combined indoor/outdoor) and answered the question regarding departure; 62.1% (n = 18) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 37.9% (n = 11) had not considered.  A total of 11 respondents identified as head coaches of volleyball and answered the question regarding departure; 54.5% (n = 6) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 45.5% (n = 5) had not considered.     For the purposes of anonymity, the following sports were combined during analysis: bowling, fencing, gymnastics, crew/rowing, skiing, and tennis.  There were less than 10 respondents for each of these sports.  Of the 26 total respondents that comprised this grouping and answered the question regarding departure; 50% (n = 13) of those respondents marked they had considered departure, while the remaining 45.5% (n = 5) had not considered.

As discussed in the descriptive statistics section in chapter 3, a majority of respondents identified within one subgrouping of race: of the 199 respondents, 92.5% identified as white.  Again, for the purposes of anonymity and statistical analysis, the remaining respondents who identified as Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and “other” were grouped together as “people of color”.  As with sexual orientation, those respondents who marked “prefer not to answer” were not included in this portion of the analysis.  There was a total of 193 respondents that answered the question regarding race as well as departure that were used in this analysis.  Of those 193, 181 respondents identified as white.  Of those respondents identifying as white, 61.9% (n = 112) had considered departure while 38.1% (n = 69) had not.  While respondents identifying as Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and “other,” 41.7% (n = 5) had considered departure while 58.3% (n = 7) had not. Table 21 provides an overview of these statistics. Table 21.

The minimum expected count is 4.73 Sexual Orientation Much like with race, a large majority of respondents identify within one subgrouping of sexual orientation.   A total of 77% (n = 155) identified as heterosexual.  Due to this large majority of respondents identifying with one subgrouping, it was necessary to combine the responses from respondents who identified as lesbian, bisexual, gay, queer, and pansexual when assessing how departure intentions differ based on sexual orientation.  This decision was made for both statistical analysis purposes as well as to enhance anonymity of respondents, and will be discussed further in chapter 5.   Respondents who selected “prefer not to answer” regarding the question about sexual orientation were not accounted for in this portion of the analysis.   To determine initial relationship between departure and sexual orientation, descriptive crosstabs were run.  There was a total of 192 respondents who answered both the question regarding consideration of departure as well as sexual orientation.  Of those respondents that identified as lesbian, bisexual, gay, queer, or pansexual, 57.5% (n = 23) have considered departing their position while 42% (n = 17) have not.  Of the respondents identifying as    70heterosexual, 61.2% (n = 93) have considered departure while 38.8% (n= 59) have not.  See Table 23 for an overview. Table 23.

The minimum expected count is 15.83      71ANOVA To address how factors that influence potential departure differ by sport, an ANOVA was conducted.   Due to the crossover with so many respondents serving as dual sport coaches within the sports of cross country and track and field, these two sports were combined for this analysis.  Bowling, fencing, gymnastics, crew/rowing, and tennis were also combined for both analysis and anonymity purposes due to limited respondents from each of these sports.  Within the variable of job satisfaction, there were slight differences in the means between sports.  While respondents from all sports fell generally within the range of “somewhat satisfied,” some respondents indicated more job satisfaction than others.  Respondents from volleyball (n = 11) reported the highest overall satisfaction (M = 2.18; SD = 0.51), followed by golf (n = 14) who reported (M = 2.18; SD = 0.72), combined sports of bowling, fencing, gymnastics, crew/rowing, and tennis (n = 27) who reported (M = 2.25; SD = 0.77), softball (n = 13) who reported (M = 2.28; SD = 0.42), lacrosse (n = 17) who reported (M = 2.30; SD = 0.61), cross country and track and field combined (n = 34) who reported (M = 2.36; SD = 0.70), swimming/diving (n = 24) who reported (M = 2.40; SD = 0.74), basketball (n = 16) who reported (M = 2.41; SD = 0.65), soccer (n = 16) who reported (M = 2.28; SD = 0.42), ice hockey (n = 17) who reported (M = 2.50; SD = 0.57), and finally field hockey (n = 10) who were least satisfied (M = 2.54; SD = 1.00).  There were no statistically significant differences in job satisfaction between the different sports, F (10,188) = 0.414, p = .939. Similar to job satisfaction, there were only slight differences in the means between sports for organizational support.  Respondents from each sport “somewhat agreed” to feeling supported by the athletic department.  Respondents from volleyball (n = 11) reported the highest overall feeling of support (M = 2.15; SD = 0.62), followed by swimming/diving (n = 24) who    72reported (M = 2.23; SD = 0.72), ice hockey (n = 17) who reported (M = 2.23; SD = 0.91), field hockey (n = 10) who reported (M = 2.23; SD = 1.00), combined sports of bowling, fencing, gymnastics, crew/rowing, and tennis (n = 27) who reported (M = 2.24; SD = 0.96), lacrosse (n = 17) who reported (M = 2.28; SD = 0.76), soccer (n = 16) who reported (M = 2.34; SD = 0.94), golf (n = 14) who reported (M = 2.42; SD = 0.94), cross country and track and field combined (n = 34) who reported (M = 2.43; SD = 0.80), softball (n = 13) who reported (M = 2.43; SD = 0.70), and finally basketball (n = 16) who reported feeling the least amount of support from the athletic department (M = 2.45; SD = 0.99).  There were no statistically significant differences in organizational support between the different sports, F (10,188) = 0.252, p = .990. In regard to gender stereotyping, there was a slightly higher difference between the means between sports.  Respondents from each sport reported gender stereotyping was somewhere between “not at all a barrier” and “a barrier to a small extent”.  Respondents from field hockey (n = 10) found gender stereotyping to serve as the smallest barrier out of all sports (M = 3.62; SD = 2.88), followed by ), golf (n = 14) who reported (M = 3.70; SD = 2.40), volleyball (n = 11)  who reported (M = 3.93; SD = 2.11), ice hockey (n = 17) who reported (M = 4.31; SD = 2.87), combined sports of bowling, fencing, gymnastics, crew/rowing, and tennis (n = 27) who reported (M = 4.40; SD = 2.52), swimming/diving (n = 24) who reported (M = 4.60; SD = 2.64), softball (n = 13) who reported (M = 4.74; SD = 2.43), lacrosse (n = 17) who reported (M = 4.74; SD = 2.88), cross country and track and field combined (n = 34) who reported (M = 4.81; SD = 3.00), soccer (n = 16) who reported (M = 5.39; SD = 3.41) and finally basketball (n = 16) who reported feeling the most significant barrier to gender stereotyping (M = 5.43; SD = 3.08). There were no statistically significant differences in gender stereotyping between the different sports, F (10,188) = 0.657, p = .763.    73When it came to burnout, there again were, minor differences in the means between sports.  Overall, respondents fell between “somewhat agree” to “neither agree nor disagree” to feeling burnt-out within the last three years.  Respondents from field hockey (n = 10) had the smallest frequency of burnout (M = 3.00; SD = 1.76), followed by softball (n = 13) who reported (M = 2.92; SD = 1.35), volleyball (n = 11) who reported (M = 2.90; SD = 1.45), cross country and track and field combined (n = 34) who reported (M = 2.74; SD = 1.29), combined sports of bowling, fencing, gymnastics, crew/rowing, and tennis (n = 27) who reported (M = 2.67; SD = 1.39), lacrosse (n = 17) who reported (M = 2.65; SD = 1.41), soccer (n = 16) who reported (M = 2.63; SD = 1.36), basketball (n = 16) who reported (M = 2.63; SD = 1.41), swimming/diving (n = 24) who reported (M = 2.38; SD = 1.35), golf (n = 14) who reported (M = 2.36; SD = 1.08), and finally ice hockey (n = 17) who reported the most significant frequency from burnout (M = 2.23; SD = 1.35). There were no statistically significant differences in burnout between the different sports, F (10,188) = 0.477, p = .903. Lastly, work-family conflict also had limited differences within the means of the various sports.  Overall means from each sport varied from “somewhat agree” to “neither agree nor disagree” regarding questions affiliated with work-family conflict.  Respondents from field hockey (n = 10) reported the least amount of work-family conflict (M = 3.10; SD = 1.49), followed by basketball (n = 16) who reported (M = 2.56; SD = 1.20), golf (n = 14) who reported (M = 2.56; SD = 1.07), softball (n = 13) who reported (M = 2.54; SD = 0.98), soccer (n = 16) who reported (M = 2.54; SD = 1.02), swimming/diving (n = 24) who reported (M = 2.47; SD = 1.07), combined sports of bowling, fencing, gymnastics, crew/rowing, and tennis (n = 27) who reported (M = 2.40; SD = 0.90), lacrosse (n = 17) who reported (M = 2.33; SD = 0.89), volleyball (n = 11) who reported (M = 2.24; SD = 0.87), cross country and track and field    74combined (n = 34) who reported conflict (M = 2.09; SD = 0.99), and finally ice hockey (n = 17) who reported the highest amount of work-family (M = 1.95; SD = 0.62). There were no statistically significant differences in work-family conflict between the different sports, F (10,188) = 1.333, p = .224. Table 25 provides an overview of these statistics. Table 25.

For the independent variable of satisfaction, the people of color group (n=13) reported slightly higher job satisfaction (M = 2.30, SD = 0.71) than the respondents who identified as white (n=184) who reported (M = 2.35, SD = 0.68); however, there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean job satisfaction scores between respondents identifying as white or as people of color, t(195) = .22, p = .83. For the independent variable of organizational support, the people of color group (n=13) reported slightly higher organizational support (M = 2.25, SD = 0.62) than the respondents who identified as White (n=184) who reported (M = 2.31, SD = 0.85); however, there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean job satisfaction scores between respondents identifying as white or as people of color, t(195) = .26, p = .79. For the independent variable of gender stereotype, the people of color group (n=13) reported a lower impact to the barrier of gender stereotyping (M = 4.31, SD = 3.01) than the respondents who identified as white (n=184) who reported (M = 4.58, SD = 2.74); however, there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean job satisfaction scores between respondents identifying as white or as people of color, t(195) = .34, p = .73. For the independent variable of burnout, the people of color group (n=13) reported a slightly lower feeling of burnout (M = 3.15, SD = 1.57) than the respondents who identified as white (n=183) who reported (M = 2.60, SD = 1.32); however, there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean job satisfaction scores between respondents identifying as white or as people of color, t(194) = -.1.44, p = .52.    76For the independent variable of work-family conflict, the people of color group (n=13) reported a slightly lower feeling of work-family conflict (M = 2.52, SD = 1.28) than the respondents who identified as white (n=183) who reported (M = 2.38, SD = 1.00); however, there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean job satisfaction scores between respondents identifying as white or as people of color, t(194) = -.49, p = .63.

Respondents had the opportunity to answer the following questions regarding support and intention to depart: (1) How could the people in your workplace better support you? and (2) If you have considered leaving your head coaching position, what have been the main factors in this consideration?  To analyze the two open-ended questions in the survey, all responses were coded and themes were identified.  For the question regarding support, the following themes were identified: recognition/ acknowledgement, salary/resources, empathy/relating, and equity.  When analyzing the question regarding departure, the themes of organizational support, job satisfaction, burnout, gender, and work-family conflict were assessed.  Two additional themes arose through the coding process, inclusive of lack of assistant coaches as well as non-coaching, administration responsibilities. Support   Recognition and acknowledgement were the most widely mentioned topics, noted by 27 respondents.  One respondent noted, From a higher level (my boss), my work is not recognized, I often do not feel supported or heard. I could be better supported by the higher levels by recognizing the work I do, supporting my goals, holding me to high expectations, and providing support/ideas for areas where I request more support.  Overall, responses included the need for increased recognition from institutional administration, athletic administration, and coworkers. It is important to note that respondents mentioned a need for recognition and acknowledgement not just for themselves, but also for their team as well as the individual student-athletes.  Examples of recognition came in many forms detailed in both when and how these acknowledgements could be made; these included after games, achievement    81of professional development, work ethic, and after a good season.  Coaches noted this communication could happen through conversations, social media, and even email.   A multitude of topics within the range of salary and resources were mentioned by 26 respondents regarding how they could be better supported.  Topics encompassed within the theme of salary and resources include: Equitable pay, fair compensation with consideration of time and duties, resource allocation for travel, recruiting, and staffing.  One respondent specifically mentioned she felt the need to supplement the budget for her program fell on her to complete through fundraising, at the expense of a day off, noting; “I coach 3 seasons so I rarely get a weekend off during the school year and I feel when I could have a Saturday or Sunday off, I'm fundraising for my program because we are underfunded.”  The theme of empathy and relating was mentioned 13 times by respondents.  While one coach simply said the people in their workplace could better support them by simply “experiencing what I do”, another respondent wrote “be an ACTIVE ally.”  Another topic within empathy and relating was the need to form real connections within the department.  Through forming real connections, a respondent felt as though it may open the door to share advice and talk through different situations.  The topic of equity was addressed 12 times by respondents in a variety of ways.  While some respondents mentioned the importance of equity of pay between men and women coaches as well as equitable staffing, others mentioned equity in the promotion of men’s and women’s sports from a social media perspective.  Equity was also mentioned, not simply in reference to gender, but for all sports.  One respondent noted they could be better supported through, “equal support for all sports (not monetarily, but genuine care/support).”      82Departure Intentions  In relation to the question “If you have considered leaving your head coaching position, what have been the main factors in this consideration?” there were 69 responses tied to the themes of both work-family conflict and organizational support.  There was a total of 38 respondents who noted reasoning specific to work-family conflict, while 31 respondents mentioned lack of support either from their athletic department, institution administration, or fellow coaches.  One respondent who noted their reason for considering leaving their head coaching position was based on work-family conflict noted: “During the academic year, I rarely get a day off. I miss spending time with my family and I feel like my family often comes 2nd even though I don't want them to be.”  While another respondent noted specifically the lack of support as the reason for considering departure stating, “How I was treated by the staff. I am the only female in my athletics department.” An additional 27 respondents noted issues with job satisfaction, more specifically 23 of those respondents mentioned a lack in satisfaction specifically related to salary.  One respondent noted, “too little pay for the time and work.”  The topic of feeling exhausting in the form of burnout was mentioned by 16 respondents.  One respondent noted, “I'm exhausted, underpaid, under-appreciated, and the demands of the job are unreasonable.”  An additional nine respondents noted an issue with unhappiness related to treatment due to gender.   One coach noted the following in relation to why she had considered leaving her position, more specifically based on the lack of respect and support that she felt from administration: “I have never truly felt like being a young woman was a disadvantage until I became a coach.”      83Additional Themes Two additional themes presented through these open-ended questions emerged that were not addressed in the survey.  There was a total of seven respondents who made specific note about non-coaching administrative responsibilities within their position that have led them to consider leaving their head coaching position.  One respondent noted, “Coaching is not what burns me out, it’s the responsibilities to run the pool that are mentally draining.” Another topic that arose was the lack of assistant coaches, which in turn created a need for the head coach to fulfil all team needs by themselves.  An additional component of this topic was inconsistencies of assistant staffing across sports, but also within conferences.  One coach mentioned she did not have the same resource as her conference opponents, as she was the only coach the conference without a full-time assistant coach.  “There is an expectation to win championships at my workplace, yet I am the only coach in the league without a full- time assistant. A full-time assistant would be a huge lift. Especially when the job expectation is to win.” In the next chapter, I bring together the results of the study as presented in this chapter and connect it with the existing literature base.            84CHAPTER 5  DISCUSSION, KEY FINDINGS, IMPLICATIONS, AND FUTURE RESEARCH  There has been a drastic decline in the percentage of women coaches at the collegiate level over the past 40 years (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  Prior to the passing of Title IX in 1972, women accounted for roughly 90% of those coaches in women’s sports; however, after more than 40 years, that percentage has dropped by nearly 50% (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  The rationale behind the decline in percentages is multifaceted, with some researchers focused on major obstacles for women in the world of collegiate athletics leading to their departure (Kamphoff, 2010; Kilty, 2006; Pastore & Judd, 1993), while others shifting their focus to hiring practices (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014; Welch & Sigelman, 2007). The purpose of this study was to understand the factors influencing the potential departure decisions of women coaches and, in turn, to facilitate an opportunity and suggestions for informed change.  In this chapter, I provide a brief discussion of this study’s results and implications, followed by the recommendations for practice and policy gleaned from the study.  I then address recommendations for future research.  Key Findings and Implications In determining the relationship of the independent variables on the potential departure of women coaches at the NCAA Division III level, job satisfaction, organizational support, gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, and burnout all independently had statistically significant relationships with the consideration of departure variable.  I discuss each in turn below along with their implications.      85Burnout Through use of a binomial logistic regression there was an opportunity to understand the unique contributions of each independent variable while controlling for the other variables.  Even when controlling for the other independent variables, burnout was highly statistically significant (p=.000). The effect size for burnout within the regression model was d = -0.618; suggesting a medium to large effect size.  Burnout can be caused by negative forms of stress that coaches experience within the profession (Frey, 2007).  The literature suggests stress may result from the intense time demands (Frey, 2007; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al., 2015), pressure to win (Pastore & Judd, 1993; Theberge, 1993), balancing family obligations (Kamphoff, 2010; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al., 2015 Rhode & Walker, 2008; Welch & Sigelman, 2007), managing program finances (Welch & Sigelman, 2007), as well as perfectionism (Deuling & Burns, 2017; Tashman et al., 2010).  The results from this study coincide with prior research and literature regarding the impact of burnout on the consideration of departure for women coaches (Frey, 2007; Kamphoff, 2010; Pastore & Judd, 1993).   Findings from the open-ended questions in this study also supported the quantitative results regarding burnout as one of the main factors that influences a coach’s consideration to leave their position.  Responses supported prior research regarding themes that lead to the type of stress and exhaustion that produces burnout (Kamphoff, 2010; Pastore & Judd, 1993).  Respondents mentioned high demands, and inability to balance their family commitments, position responsibilities outside of just the coaching aspect, and even questioning whether they were good enough to be successful in their role.  Due to the strong relationship of burnout with the factors that contribute to consideration to departure found in this study, it is crucial to understand the implications that surround this    86state of burnout.  Findings from this study also revealed that 58.6% (n = 126) of coaches reported either somewhat agreeing or strongly agreeing with feeling burnt-out within the last three years.  There are a multitude of factors related to stress that may lead to burnout. Diving deeper into understanding the intricacies, Maslach et al. (2001) modeled the three dimensions of burnout including: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.   Of these three dimensions, exhaustion is the most commonly noted, encompassing the feelings and impact of stress.  In the coaching field, stress may stem from a variety of areas including intense time demands of juggling the many responsibilities within the position (Frey, 2007; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al., 2015) as well as an overwhelming pressure to balance family obligations (Kamphoff, 2010; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al., 2015; Rhode & Walker, 2008; Welch & Sigelman, 2007). Depersonalization, the second dimension of burnout, occurs as the result of this exhaustion, in which a person begins to distance themselves from the duties of their job (Maslach et al., 2001).  More specifically for women coaches, job duties may include: teaching skills within their respective sports, planning and conducting practices, developing strategy for competition, recruiting and retaining student-athletes, coordinating team travel, managing a budget, monitoring academic progress, as well as ensuring compliance within their respective institution and to both their local and national conference affiliates (NCAA Market, 2019a, 2019b, 2019c).  Ultimately, if a coach distances themselves from their responsibilities and becomes ineffective within their role, this impact may be felt by their staff, the student-athletes, and the athletic department. The final dimension of burnout, reduced personal accomplishment, coincides with both the emotional exhaustion a person can feel within their job and when that person distancing    87themselves from their role responsibilities (Maslach et al., 2001).  Much like depersonalization, when a coach begins to become less effective within their role, it may have a larger implication for the team and department.  However, unlike exhaustion and depersonalization that are typically influenced by workload, reduced personal accomplishment is more closely related to lack of resources (Maslach et al., 2001).  The responses in the open-ended question portion of this study provided examples of shortcomings in financial resources for women coaches including: salary as well as resource allocation for travel, recruiting, and staffing.   Implications Results from this portion of the study suggest that women coaches at the NCAA Division III level may not be aware of the factors influencing the feeling of burnout until they are, in fact, burnt-out.  Results also suggest that there may be a disconnect in how or if athletic departments are addressing burnout, as the majority of respondents felt burnt-out within the past three years.  To combat burnout in the workplace, Maslach (2011) provided three recommended action steps for organizations to implement including enhanced engagement, departmental assessment, and early intervention.  These recommendations may be adapted for utilization within an athletic department to improve coaching burnout, perhaps ultimately impacting the intention to depart.   Based on results from this study, many respondents noted the need to feel supported by institutional administration, athletic administration, and coworkers.  Through the facilitation of engagement opportunities by the Athletic Director, such as informal gatherings, group bonding activities, and regular athletic meetings, deeper working relationships may be built and thereby encouraging additional support. Involvement in decision making processes, supervisor support, and coworker support may assist in reducing stress but may also alleviate the impact of burnout on employees (Miller, Ellis, Zook, & Lyles, 1990).    88In addition, Athletic Directors should involve coaches in departmental assessments encompassing the elements of burnout to understand the current strengths and weaknesses, in turn facilitating opportunities for positive change (Maslach, 2011).  Organizational change may be either transformation or incremental (Bess & dee, 2008b).  Transformational change may encompass a large-scale shift in organizational practices; while incremental change utilizes small changes, ultimately leading to long-term shifts (Bess & Dee, 2008b).  Involving coaches in departmental assessments may help Athletic Directors facilitate incremental changes that influence the overall long-term obstacles that lead to burnout.  Additionally, early intervention may be another avenue to address burnout.  Maslach (2011) noted one early indication may be through assessing exhaustion.  However, results from this study suggest further education surrounding the factors that influence burnout may be beneficial for women coaches.  Through the use of professional development webinars, coaches may be able to identify more specific factors that contribute to the feeling of exhaustion, and in turn, provide guidance on how to best navigate ways to avoid this barrier. Job Satisfaction and Organizational Support In the second set of results from this study, I found the relationship between job satisfaction combined with organizational support within the regression model to be statistically significant in relation to departure intentions.  The effect size for job satisfaction and organizational support within the regression model was d = 0.569; suggesting a medium effect size.  These results support prior research and literature regarding the impact of both job satisfaction and organizational support on departure intentions of women coaches (Kamphoff, 2010, Knight et al., 2015).  Job satisfaction relates specifically to an employee’s mindset connected to the inner workings of their position (Hellman, 1997; Tooksoon, 2011), while    89perceived organizational support is when “employees form global beliefs concerning the extent to which the organization values their contributions and care about their well-being” (Eisenberger et al., 1986, p. 504).   In this study, the areas of job satisfaction that were addressed were general satisfaction, salary, career achievements, recognition, workload, responsibility, athletic department support, and institutional support.  Results from this study showed that coaches who responded to the survey were the least satisfied with salary and institutional support.  Both job satisfaction and institutional support were also themes in the open-ended questions regarding the consideration of departure.  While job satisfaction was the most prevalent theme, frustration with salary might be perceived as being at the root of this response.  This finding coincides with results from a study conducted by Kamphoff (2010) in which low salary was a part of the decision to leave the profession.  Similar to findings in a study conducted by Knight et al. (2015), responses to the open-ended question in this study showed it was not simply a low salary that impacted satisfaction, but rather the low salary compounded by the time demands and overall workload expected.  While support was briefly addressed within the context of job satisfaction in this study, organizational support was further assessed in the survey through a separate grouping of scaled questions as well as an open-ended question.  Results from the scaled questions showed a mean of responses with moderate agreement in the areas of people in their workplace valuing their contributions, genuinely caring about their wellbeing, taking pride in their accomplishments, and caring about their general satisfaction at work.  The mean responses pointed to respondents’ ambivalence in regard to people in their workplace failing to demonstrate appreciation when they give extra effort, ignore their complaints, or failing to notice when they give their best.  Mean    90responses also showed moderate disagreement with the statement that people in their workplace show very little concern for them.   Respondents had the opportunity to further address the topic of organizational support by answering an open-ended question: How could the people in your workplace better support you? Recognition and acknowledgement, salary and resources, empathy and relating, and equity were all themes that arose.  These results support past studies in which researchers found that coaches sought out differing types of support including financial, facilities, resources, and emotional (Knight et al., 2015). Similarly, Kamphoff (2010) also found that lack of support from administrators served as a main theme in coaching departure. The direct link between job satisfaction and organizational support coincides with results from research studies conducted by Dixon and Sagas (2007) as well as Kim and Cunningham (2005), which examined the impact of organizational support on job satisfaction for coaches and for assistant coaches, specifically.  When examining the relationships for women head coaches in the current study, not only was there a strong relationship between these two independent variables (r = .713, n = 199, p = .000), but when combined in the regression model, there was statistical significance with the consideration to depart (p = .003).  These results suggest that when women coaches at the NCAA Division III level do not feel supported, they tend to be less satisfied with their job, ultimately influencing their consideration to leave their position.    Implications Implications drawn from this set of results reflect the importance of coaches’ feelings of support by their administration. Such support may thereby influence job satisfaction and consequently impact retention.  A shift in support, in other words, may influence the shift in a coach’s mindset.  While some forms of support in the results of this study may consist of    91financial resources – such as salary, assistant coach positions, and overall sport budget – some forms of support can be garnered without financial impact. Major non-financial forms of support noted by respondents in this study included recognition, acknowledgement, empathy, and professional relationship development.  There were a multitude of recommendations given by respondents in ways that their department, inclusive of the Athletic Director and their colleagues, could better support them including recognizing a job well done, a milestone, major achievements after a good game, completion of professional development, recognizing a strong work ethic, or accolades after a solid season.  Coaches expressed the need for conversation, promotion on social media, or even something as simple as a congratulatory email.   On a deeper level, this support may be reflected by athletic leadership having a greater understanding of the experiences of coaches.  Through a connection of understanding the challenges within the position, athletic leadership may be able to become an active ally or develop connections that create an avenue for sharing advice and talking through difficult situations.   In turn, creating a positive mentoring type relationship may allow for women to feel supported (Bower & Hums, 2014; Inglis et al., 2000; Levesque et al., 2005; Marshall, 2001) and exhibit more satisfaction with their positions (Ragins, Cotton, & Miller, 2000).   Another potential impact from these results is connected to the concept of mentoring. While mentoring has many definitions, Weaver and Chelladurai (1999) defined mentoring “as a process in which a more experienced person (i.e., the mentor) serves as a role model, provides guidance and support to a developing novice (i.e., the protégé), and sponsors that individual’s career progress” (p. 25). A mentoring relationship can be of benefit both to the mentor and to the protégé (Weaver & Chelladurai, 1999).  While mentoring may be conducted in a variety of fashions, the methods of mentoring can be either formal or informal. For women specifically,    92Ragins et al. (2000) found mentoring may be more productive in an informal setting. Mentorship can be formed within the department or outside of the athletic department if there is guidance, support, and mutual respect provided (Inglis et al., 2000).  Developing informal mentorship and networking opportunities for women coaches may also increase feelings of support, provide guidance, and allow opportunity for professional growth (Bower & Hums, 2014; Inglis et al., 2000). Work-Family Conflict  The third set of results from this study focused on work-family conflict. Work-family balance is the push and pull between responsibilities at work and those with family, often time-overlapping (Rhode & Walker, 2008). The results in this study showed that while work-family conflict had a statistically significant relationship with the consideration of departure, independently the results indicated work-family conflict did not have a statistical significance when controlling for other variables in the binomial logistic regression. Nevertheless, prior research has found work-family conflict to be one of the main factors for women to leave the profession of coaching (Kamphoff, 2010; Knight et al., 2015). Results from the scaled questions showed a mean of responses of “somewhat agree” with a total of five statements including themes of: work interfering with home life, time at work impacting family responsibilities, tasks within the home incomplete due to work, job strain that impacts familial duties, and having to reschedule family activities due to work.  Respondents had the strongest agreement with the question regarding work-related duties influencing the need to change family plans.  This finding may coincide with prior literature shedding light on coaching hours falling out of a typical 9-5 workday, with both nights and weekend hours being the norm    93(Bracken, 2009; Dixon & Bruening, 2007; Kilty, 2006; Knight et al., 2015), including the potential to work between 10-14 hours a day in season (Dixon & Bruening, 2007).  While the statistical portion of this study did not yield significance when assessing the relationship of work-family conflict with the other barriers on departure considerations, the responses regarding work-family conflict in the open-ended questions nevertheless shed light on this barrier as it pertains to the consideration to leave.  The theme of work-family conflict was addressed by 38 of the 199 respondents (19%) noting difficulties in balancing both work and life as well as missing out on major milestones of children due to the demands of the job.       Implications  Implications from this part of the results suggest the need for coaches to have a work-family supportive environment.  Prior research suggests that when an employee feels as though their work environment is not supportive of family, they tend to have higher work-family conflict, lower satisfaction within the job, as well as a higher tendency to leave their position (Allen, 2001).  Having a supportive environment may lead to an employee utilizing benefits provided by their employer (Allen, 2001).  Dixon, Tiell, Lough, Sweeney, and Bruening (2013) noted work-family benefits including: compensatory time, flexible time, compressed work week, telecommuting, childcare referrals, family travel arrangements, wellness programs, family exercise programs, family problem referrals, employee assistance programs, FMLA, paternity/maternity leave, family emergency leave, phased retirement, and tuition reimbursement.   While making these benefits available is a start, it is imperative for the usage of such support structures to be encouraged by supervisors (Allen, 2001; Dixon et al., 2013).  Allen (2001) defined a family-supportive supervisor as someone “who is sympathetic to the    94employee’s desire to seek balance between work and family and who engages in efforts to help the employee accommodate his or her work and family responsibilities” (p. 417). In college athletics especially, coaches may not be likely to utilize such benefits due to the competitive atmosphere without proper encouragement from their Athletic Director (Dixon et al., 2013); placing a crucial role on the supervisor to ensure employees feel supported.  Proper support for and utilization of benefits may help in addressing some of the issues, faced by respondents of this current study, in balancing both work and life.  Gender Stereotyping Barriers Much like work-family conflict, the results of this study pointed to barriers associated with gender stereotyping having a statistically significant relationship with the consideration of departure when examined independently. However, the results indicated these barriers did not have a statistical significance when controlling for other variables in the binomial logistic regression. The following categories were included within the measurement for barriers of gender stereotyping: lack of acceptance from colleagues, discrimination, patronizing attitudes of colleagues, boys’ club mentality, and homophobia. “Boys’ club mentality” was the most prevalently reported barrier for respondents, followed by patronizing attitudes of colleagues and lack of acceptance from colleagues; homophobia served as the smallest barrier.  It should be noted, however, that majority of the 199 respondents of this survey identified as heterosexual (n=155; 77.9%).  The lack of demographic representation for those identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, queer, or pansexual may also account for the lack of significance.  Prior research has found gender stereotyping to be a specific challenge for women working in collegiate athletics (Bower et al., 2015).  For women coaches, gender stereotyping came in the form of patronizing attitudes regarding women in leadership roles (Bower et al.,    952015; Burton, 2105; Norman, 2012a), homophobia (Kamphoff, 2010; Kilty, 2006; Norman, 2012b), and disproportionate opportunities for membership to inner circles and mentorship (Bower et al., 2015; Marshall, 2001). Responses from open-ended questions yielded responses regarding harassment, lack of gender equity, lack of respect due to gender, as well as gender bias. The literature reports that there is a long-standing history of male-dominance in the field of collegiate athletics (Estler & Nelson, 2005; Thelin, 2011).  Within this dominated long-standing history, comes long-established networking relationships within the coaching field.  These long-standing relationships provide opportunity for information sharing and relationship building within the profession of coaching that women have not been afforded (Kerr & Marshall, 2007).  Results from this study show “boys’ club mentality” serves as the most significant barrier for women coaches within the issue of gender stereotyping.   Implications Implications from this portion of the results highlight the need to overcome a long-standing history of the boys’ club mentality. Shifting away from this historical boys’ club mentality may facilitate a pivot to a more equitable distribution of power and create more opportunities for women to feel accepted in the field of collegiate athletics (Theberge, 1993).  In turn, it is important for women coaches to be able to access mentoring relationships and networks, as it relates to working through challenges faced within the coaching profession (Marshall, 2001).  In forming these mentoring relationships, it is crucial to select a mentor that is compatible with the protégé or order to maximize job satisfaction and yield the highest benefit for both parties (Ragins et al., 2000; Weaver & Chelladurai, 1999).  Prior to the mentoring process, both mentor and protégé should go through a training process (Marshall, 2001).     96Women coaches could be mentored by either a man or a woman; however, Fowler, Gudmundsson, and O’Gorman (2007) found women mentors provided more ‘personal and emotional guidance’ as well as more ‘career development facilitation’ to women mentees.   While having a mentor with similar qualities may yield stronger satisfaction for the protégé, women in the field of athletics may benefit from seek out cross-gendered mentoring (Bower, 2009).  Cross-gender mentoring may have a more significant impact for women coaches due to the longstanding history of men in positions of power within athletics (Bower, 2009).  Successful mentors typically have longevity within the field, as well as status, power, and expertise (Weaver & Chelladurai, 1999).   For women in general, Levesque, O’Neill, Nelson, and Dumais (2005) found both ‘championing’ and ‘acceptance and confirmation’ to be the most significant components of a mentoring relationship to the protégé. More specifically in the field of athletics, mentoring relationships have been found to provide critical insight and support to the protégé (Bower & Hums, 2014; Inglis et al., 2000).  The long-term benefits of mentoring may include the opportunity for the protégé to advance, enhanced respect and heightened status for the mentor, as well as decreased departure rates for the institution (Weaver & Chelladurai, 1999).   The opportunity to form mentoring relationships could be initiated by the NCAA, the institution’s local conference affiliation, the athletic department itself, or even in collaboration of other departments on campus.  Additional opportunities to enhance networking and facilitate additional mentorship opportunities may be gained through coaching associations.  Athletic departments should provide both financial support and encouragement for coaches to join these professional associations.  Organizations such as “weCOACH” unite women coaches and provide opportunity for networking, information sharing, and educational workshops.  More    97specifically, the vision statement of weCOACH highlights their dedication to “the recruitment, advancement, and retention of women coaches of all sports and levels” (WeCOACH, n.d., n.p.).  This may be one way for coaches from differing sports to connect and develop alongside of each other.   Additionally, there may be sport specific organizations for women coaches to connect with other coaches specifically in their respective sport.  Organizations such as the Women’s Basketball Coaching Association (WBCA) exist to connect, educate, and guide women basketball coaches at all levels (Women’s Basketball Coaches Association, n.d.).  Athletic departments should be supportive in membership to these organizations. Key Findings and Implications by Sport, Race, and Sexual Orientation When analyzing by specific demographic information, it was necessary in this study to combine groups together for both statistical analysis purposes as well as to protect the anonymity of the respondents.  For example, all sports with fewer than 10 respondents were grouped together including bowling, fencing, gymnastics, rowing/crew, skiing, and tennis.  Three sports had no respondents, including beach volleyball, rifle, and water polo.   A similar stance was taken to analyze statistical information within the structure of race, as all respondents who identified as Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, “Other,” and “Prefer not to answer” were all grouped together.  Likewise, regarding sexual orientation, the same approach was used with respondents who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, queer, pansexual, and “Prefer not to answer.”   Sport Within the category of sport, there was a diverse representation of coaches from a majority of the championship sport offering, with the exception of the following: beach    98volleyball, rifle, and water polo.  As mentioned previously, all sports with less than 10 respondents were grouped together for both statistical analysis purposes as well as anonymity. Crosstabulations were run to determine differences in consideration to depart between respondents from each sport.  The percentage of departure intentions by sport did not differ significantly between the sports. Next, an ANOVA was conducted to understand the factors that influence departure in women coaches at the NCAA Division III level differed by sport.  For this analysis, the sports of cross country as well as track and field were also combined.  While there were minor differences within the means of each sport, there was not a statistically significant relationship between any of the factors by sport. For the variable of job satisfaction, volleyball coaches reported the highest job satisfaction and field hockey coaches reported the least amount of satisfaction.  Volleyball coaches reported feeling the most supported of all the sports, while basketball coaches reported feeling the least supported.  Field hockey coaches reported the least significant barrier to gender stereotyping, while basketball coaches reported the highest.  For burnout, field hockey coaches reported the smallest frequency of burnout, while ice hockey coaches reported the highest frequency.  Finally, field hockey coaches reported the least amount of work-family conflict, while ice hockey coaches reported the highest.    There are 21 championship sports in total at the NCAA Division III including basketball, bowling, cross country, field hockey, fencing, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, rifle, rowing, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming/diving, tennis, track and field (indoor and outdoor), beach volleyball, volleyball, and water polo (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-c).  As of April 2020, representation of women head coaches ranged from 258 in women’s basketball to two in the sports of rifle as well as water polo.  Much like between the three NCAA divisions,    99there are potential differences within sport including in practice and season lengths, budgets and pay, as well as travel schedules.  Results from this study differ from assumptions based on these unique differences between sport. Implications  Implications drawn from the results of this study suggest that while there are no significant differences in the factors that influence departure between sports, there is an opportunity to utilize the unique nature of each sport to address the similarity of barriers each coach is experiencing; in turn creating a more cohesive and supportive athletic environment.  Through the Athletic Director bringing coaches together within the various sports, there is an opportunity to enhance peer support and encourage connections that would promote networking and advice sharing (Marshall, 2001; Norman, 2012a; Rhode & Walker 2008).  Examples of where these connections could be made include: professional development training, department bonding activities, or even staff meetings.  Ultimately, when there is a supportive culture within the athletic department, coaches are more satisfied with their jobs (Dixon & Sagas, 2007).   While working to create a more cohesive environment, there may be an opportunity for the athletic department to assess the overall organizational culture through use of Schein’s (1992) organizational culture framework (Bess & Dee, 2008a).  Within this model, there are three levels of organizational culture to be considered including artifacts, values, and beliefs (Bess & Dee, 2008a).  The Athletic Director may begin by assessing the department’s artifacts inclusive of the staff interactions and professional relationships, departmental communication and athletic website, as well as the evident behavior and norms of staff and coaches.  Likewise, the next step would be to assess the values of the department to more fully understand and improve upon the shared feelings of the coaches on the department.  Lastly, in following with    100this framework, the Athletic Director would seek to understand the assumptions by more fully comprehending each coach and their relationships with each other, the department, and institution as a whole (Bess & Dee, 2008a). Race There is very limited representation of racial diversity in the profession of coaching, in fact in the 2017-18 academic year, over 90% of women’s sports were coached by white coaches (Lapchick et al., 2019).  This statistic coincides with the limited diversity in response to this study.  Of the 199 respondents, 92.5% (n = 184) identified as white, while 7.5% (n = 15) identified as people of color.  Crosstabulations were run to determine differences in consideration to depart between respondents identifying at white and people of color.  The percentage of departure intentions by race did not differ significantly between the white group and the people of color group.  Independent t-tests were conducted to understand how the factors that influence departure in women coaches at the NCAA Division III level differed by race.  There were only minor differences in the mean scores between respondents in the white group and respondents who identified as people of color.  Respondents who identified as people of color responded to having slightly higher job satisfaction, felt slightly more supported by their athletic department, while also reporting slightly lower impact of gender stereotyping, lower burnout, and even lower work-family conflict.  While the mean scores show a very minor difference, overall there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of any of the variables between white and people of color. Prior literature focused on race, shed light on the limited representation of racial diversity in the profession of coaching (Lapchick et al., 2019).  Likewise, this current study also has    101limited representation of racial diversity within respondents.  Over 90% of respondents identified as white.  The lack of women of color in the coaching profession sheds a glaring light on how the intersectionality of race and gender can impact opportunity and experiences (Carter-Francique & Olushola, 2016).  Implications While the results from this study showed no statistically significant relationship between the factors that influence departure between the white and people of color respondents, past literature has found discrimination to be an impactful component of why women of color leave the coaching profession (Cunningham, 2010).  Further research on departure intentions as well as the overall limited representation of racial diversity within the field of collegiate coaching is needed.  Only 7.5% (n = 15) of respondents of this study identified as people of color; echoing previous literature on the limited representation of racial diversity (Lapchick et al., 2019).  While this study aimed to understand how the factors that influenced departure intentions differed by race, further questions surrounding the lack of racial diversity arose from the results.  The lack of racial diversity of respondents from this study confirm there is an opportunity to understand more about the lack of representation of people of color coaches regarding both hiring practices as well as departure. One avenue to address these inequities for athletic departments should be to consider seeking out the coaching enhancement grants provided by the NCAA.  These grants fund “new, full-time assistant coaches for all NCAA-sponsored sports during a two-year commitment (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-h, n.p.).  These grants provide opportunity to enhance diversity of both ethnicities as well as gender in athletics (National Collegiate Athletic    102Association, n.d.-h, n.p.).  These assistant coaching positions may pave the way for opportunity for advancement to the head coach level.   Additionally, Athletic Directors should seek to offer educational opportunities for athletic staff, coaches, and student-athletes to foster an inclusive environment that is supportive of racial diversity (National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2020).  Through training and assessing current practices, athletic administers may identify opportunity to enhance the overall climate of the department.  Likewise, administrators should seek out collaborative opportunities with institutional groups or organizations focused on diversity efforts.  These partnerships may provide opportunity for information sharing and best practices to enhance support structures within the athletic department (National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2020).   Sexual Orientation  Of the 199 respondents, 77.9% (n = 155) identified as heterosexual, while 20.6% (n = 41) identified within the LGBTQ group.  An additional 1.5% (n =3) preferred not to answer and were not included in the analysis.  Crosstabulations were run to determine differences in consideration to depart between respondents identifying as heterosexual and LGBTQ.  The percentage of departure intentions by sexual orientation did not differ significantly between the heterosexual and the LGBTQ groups.  Results from this study differ from assumptions based on prior literature in which homophobia hinders both opportunity and experience for women in coaching, as societal norms paint an adverse picture of lesbian coaches (Kilty, 2006; Norman, 2012b).  In previous studies, homophobia has been indicated as a reason for lesbian coaches to leave the profession; more specifically due to the strong demands of needing to conceal their sexual orientation (Kamphoff, 2010).      103Independent t-tests were conducted to understand how the factors that influence departure in women coaches at the NCAA Division III level differed by sexual orientation.  Respondents who identified as LGBTQ reported having slightly higher job satisfaction, felt slightly more supported by their athletic department, yet felt a slightly higher sense of burnout and work-family conflict.  Respondents who identified as LGBTQ reported having lower impact to the barrier of gender stereotype.  While the mean scores show a very minor difference, overall there was not a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of any of the variables between heterosexual and LGBTQ.  Implications Even though the implications from the results in this study suggest that factors that influence the departure of women coaches identifying as either heterosexual and LGBTQ do not differ, the literature suggests that homophobia has been indicated as a reason for lesbian coaches to leave the profession (Kamphoff, 2010). More specifically, due to the strong demands of needing to conceal their sexual orientation, LGBTQ-identified coaches may choose to leave (Kamphoff, 2010).  The literature also suggests that homophobia in college athletics may hinder opportunities for women in coaching, as societal norms paint an adverse picture of lesbian coaches (Kilty, 2006; Norman, 2012b).  While barriers should be assessed and addressed for all women coaches, regardless of sexual orientation, it may be beneficial to understand the unique attributes of those that identify within each subgroup.  To address this potential barrier and create an inclusive environment, athletic departments should adopt and promote a non-discrimination policy that is inclusive of the LGBTQ community and provide readily available resources for athletic staff, coaches, and student-athletes alike (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-i).  Likewise, Athletic Directors    104may consider implementing annual LGBTQ inclusion training with resources offered by the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-i).  This training could provide an opportunity to open dialogue and to foster personal growth and understanding department wide as well as the opportunity to collaborate with the NCAA.  The table below encompasses the recommendations based upon the implications of the findings as well as at what level these recommendations should be addressed, by who and how.       105Implication Recommendation Level Who How  Lack of awareness of burnout Enhance understanding of burnout and create engagement opportunities Athletic Department Athletic Director  §Bonding & meetings §Group assessments §Professional development Lack of support and satisfaction Increased support, understanding, acknowledgement Institution Athletic Department  Institutional leadership Athletic Director §Acknowledgement of success §Mentoring Need for work-family supportive environment Create work-family supportive environment Institution Athletic Department   Human Resources Athletic Director §Provide benefits §Support use of benefits Need to overcome boys club mentality  Provide access of  networking and mentorship opportunities to women NCAA Athletic Conference Athletic Department NCAA Diversity and Inclusion Conference Commissioner Athletic Director  §Create mentorship program within conferences (local and National) §Enhance departmental networking/mentoring §Create opportunity for membership to coaching organizations Overarching need to understand the uniqueness of coaching challenges Create a more cohesive and supportive athletic environment Athletic Department Athletic Director §Create opportunities for coaches from differing sports to connect , network, and advice share Lack of representation of people of color Actively seek ways to enhance opportunities for people of color within the coaching profession NCAA Athletic Conference Institution Athletic Department NCAA Diversity and Inclusion Conference Commissioner Human Resources Athletic Director §Seek coaching enhancement grants  Need for an inclusive environment to support LBGTQ Adopt and promote non-discrimination policy and enhance inclusivity  NCAA Athletic Conference Institution Athletic Department  NCAA Diversity and Inclusion Conference Commissioner Human Resources Athletic Director §Collaborate within the different constituents to educate, train, promote inclusivity   Table 28. Implications and Recommendations for Policy and Practice.        106Recommendations for Future Research The intent of this study was to understand the factors influencing the potential departure decisions of women coaches and, in turn, to facilitate opportunity and suggestions for informed change.  While the results from this study add to the current literature, it is important to note critical components that require additional research.  The following items are recommendations for future research surrounding women coach’s potential departure:  • While this study focused on women coaches at the Division III level, future research should delve deeper into the role of intersectionality on the factors that influence departure of women coaches across all divisions.  • While two of the research questions in this study focused on sexual orientation and race, future research should consider demographic information more discretely to ensure ample response rate and data to encompass the unique attributes of those that identify within the subgroups of sexual orientation and race; thus, ensuring that experiences of respondents from these groupings are not generalized. • The response rate for this study was 36%.  While the calculated sample size was 317, this study yielded a total of 231 responses.  Future research should aim to increase the response rate in order to seek greater generalizability for women coaches at the NCAA Division III level.  • This study showed burnout to be highly significant in relation to the factors that contribute to the consideration of departure.  Future research should seek a deeper understanding of the factors that lead to burnout as well as the disconnect between a proactive approach to avoiding burnout and the occurrence of burnout.  Additionally,    107research could seek to understand how these factors vary between NCAA Divisions I, II, and III. • Future research should seek to understand how additional institutional roles may impact the factors that influence potential departure for women coaches. • As previously mentioned, additional research should focus on the role of support staff (i.e., assistant coaches and/or graduate assistants) have on the factors that influence potential departure for women coaches. • Data from this research study revealed scenarios in which respondents coached more than one sport.  Further research regarding the potential impact of coaching more than one sport may be beneficial to the field.   • Findings from the open-ended questions in this study suggest further research is needed to identify more specific components of work-family conflict by digging deeper into the term, concept, and construct to more fully understand how the relationship with other barriers faced by women coaches may influence departure.  • Future research should seek to compare burnout as well as job satisfaction and organizational support by gender to understand if these barriers are faced by all coaches or if they are gender specific. • Additional research regarding the role of salary on the departure intentions of women coaches should be explored.  More specifically, how the impact may differ between NCAA Divisions I, II, and III. Conclusion To minimize the percentages of women leaving the coaching profession, and in turn, create an organizational culture in which women coaches feel supported, change within the    108industry of collegiate athletics is crucial.  This quantitative study was designed to understand the relationships of gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout, job satisfaction, and organizational support with the potential departure of women coaches at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level; as well as how the factors differed by sport, race and sexual orientation.  Results from this study showed significance of burnout as well as the combination of job satisfaction and organizational support within the remaining factors that influence departure intentions.  There were no significant differences in those factors by sport, race, or sexual orientation.    Further work is needed to understand and address the experiences of women coaches at the NCAA Division III level.  While this research study also aimed to understand differences by sport, race, and sexual orientation, additional work is needed to encompass the unique attributes of those that identify within the subgroups of sexual orientation and race; through understanding of intersectionality. In order to ensure women are properly represented within the realm of collegiate coaching, changes must occur in order to prevent departure.             109References Acosta, R. V. & Carpenter, L. J.

Funding:   N/A  2. Summary Background Information There has been a drastic decline in the percentage of women coaches at the collegiate level over the past 40 years (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  In the early 1970s, women coaches accounted for nearly 90% of those coaches in women’s sports; the most recent statistics, published in 2014, show that number dropped significantly to 43.4% (Acosta & Carpenter, 2014).  Women coaches face several obstacles while working in this field dominated by men (Estler & Nelson, 2005; Thelin, 2011).   Issues such as gender stereotyping (Rhode & Walker, 2008; Sartore & Cunningham, 2007), work-family conflict (Knight, Rodgers, Reade, Mrak, & Hall, 2015; Rhode & Walker, 2008), as well as burnout (Kamphoff, 2010; Pastore & Judd, 1993) have been reported for women in the profession of coaching.   NCAA Division III will be the focus of this study due to the absence of research focused on coaching departure at this level.  There is an abundance of literature focused on NCAA Division I, as well as a combination of the three divisions together. With differences in practice and season lengths, overall missions, budgets and pay, as well as travel schedules; the potential for variances in experiences for coaches within these levels is evident (National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2019a, 2019b; National Collegiate Athletic Association, n.d.-a, n.d.-b, n.d.-c, n.d.-d, n.d.-e, n.d.-f).   The purpose of this study is to understand the factors influencing the potential departure decisions of women coaches at the NCAA Division III level, and in turn, to facilitate opportunity and suggestions for informed change.  In order to address the purpose of the study, the following    142research questions will be utilized in the proposed study: How do factors inclusive of gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout, job satisfaction, and organizational support influence the consideration of departure for women coaches at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level? How do these factors differ by sport?  How do these factors differ by race?  How do these factors differ by sexual orientation? Differences regarding experiences by sport, race, and sexual orientation were selected as research questions based upon themes throughout the literature.  Identifying differences by sport was selected due to many of the same reasons to focus on Division III including possible differences in practice and season lengths, budgets and pay, as well as travel schedules.  Race was selected due to the limited representation of racial diversity in the profession of coaching (Lapchick, Zimmerman, Coleman, Murphy, & Martin, 2019).  Sexual orientation was identified due to homophobia impacting women coaches in both opportunity and departure intentions (Kamphoff, 2010). Methods  The data collection method proposed for this quantitative study is an online, web-based survey.  An online platform was chosen for both cost and time efficiency (McMillan, 2012).  Stratified sampling will be used to ensure an adequate sample exists to address the research questions.  Women coaches at both public and private NCAA Division III affiliated institutions throughout the United States will be selected for participation in this study.  The sample will also account for head coaches varying by sport to assess any potential differences within the 22 sports with NCAA Division III championship offerings. Instrument   Survey questions are shown as appendix B.     1433. Personnel  1. Principle Investigator: Jennifer Laney is a Doctoral Candidate in the Department of Higher Education at the University of Maine.  I have no prior background in doing research with human subjects.  I completed my last CITI training in 2020. 2. Faculty Advisory: Susan K. Gardner, Ph.D. is Professor of Higher Education, Director of the Rising Tide Center and Director of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the University of Maine. She received her Ph.D. in Higher Education from Washington State University in 2005. She has over 20 years of experience conducting research with human subjects, resulting in over 70 peer-reviewed publications and nearly $30M in sponsored research. Dr. Gardner completed her last CITI training in 2018. 4. Participation Recruitment  Participant population for this study will include women coaches, coaching at the NCAA Division III level. As of 2019, there were roughly 4,370 women’s teams at the NCAA Division III level and women coaches account for roughly 44.3% of coaches for women’s sports (Lapchick et al, 2019).  All women head coaches of women’s teams from NCAA Division III will be identified and the process of stratified random sampling will be used to select participants for the study (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  Men coaches will not be identified, as this study specifically focuses on the factors that influence women’s departure intentions. A list of all current NCAA Division III member institutions will be downloaded from NCAA.org.  The overall population of women head coaches of women’s sports at the NCAA Division III level will be gathered from the athletic staff directories of each of the 449 member institutions.  Stratified sampling was chosen in relation to the ability to properly address the research questions. As of 2019, there were a total of 1,936 women head coaches at the NCAA Division III    144level, accounting for 44.3% of coaches for women’s sports. Using a sample size calculator found on the Qualtrics site, based on a population size of 1,936, a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5%; a sample size of 321 is recommended (Qualtrics, n.d.).  This sample size will allow for divisions of subgroups based upon sport coached to ensure that the sample encompasses a wide range and lends itself to properly address the research questions (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  Keeping the research questions in mind, a nonproportional structure will be used within this stratified sampling to ensure that an equal number of subjects will be selected from each sport (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).  The email addresses will be loaded into Microsoft excel by sport and attached to coordinating numbers.  A software tool will be used to generate random numbers per sport to build the potential participant list.  A recruitment email will be sent with the survey link in the body of the email to all selected participants.  This email would begin with the importance of the study, followed by the assurance of anonymity as well as the importance of the respondent.  Information regarding an incentive will also be provided.  To build rapport and trust with the intended respondents, information regarding researcher’s role as an Athletic Director and former coach will be included (McMillan & Schumacher, 2010).   The recruitment email can be found in appendices section as appendix B 5. Informed Consent  Informed consent will be provided on the first screen of the survey.  This will contain information regarding a background of the research and how they were chosen as potential participants.  Next, both estimated time of survey completion as well as information regarding the use of findings will be covered.  Then information regarding risks, benefits, compensation,    145confidentiality, voluntary nature, and contact information will be provided.  The letter of informed consent can be found in the appendices section as appendix C. 6. Confidentiality  All data collected will be anonymous.  At no point in the survey will the respondents be asked for any identifying personal information inclusive of name, email, or institution name.  The survey has been built in the Qualtrics program and data will be stored in this location until May 2021.  The data will also be downloaded to the researcher’s computer for both analysis and backup purposes. Data gathered from this research project will be kept indefinitely.  7. Risks to Participants  The only risks for this study are time and inconvenience for the participants. 8. Benefits  While there are no direct benefits to the participants, there are potential benefits of the research.  One potential benefit may be an opportunity to highlight a relationship between factors influencing the potential departure decisions of women coach’s departure in hopes to facilitate opportunity and suggestions for informed change.  Another potential benefit would be to shine a light specifically on NCAA Division III women coaches, giving them a voice. 9. Compensation  The incentive for completing this survey will be an opportunity to enter a raffle to win one of two amazon gift cards; each valuing $25.00.  While participants will need to reach the end of the survey, they will not need to complete it, to have an opportunity to enter the raffle.  Participants will be given a link to redirect them to a different website to enter to win the raffle.  A redirection to a google form unassociated with the survey will ensure that their information has no connection with their responses.  Participants will not be required to enter the raffle.     146Appendix F: Descriptive Statistics of Survey Respondents  Table EI  Total respondents: Gender Identity (select all that apply)                    Table E2  Total respondents: Race                     Number of Respondents Percent of Respondents Woman 198 99.5% Transgender 0 0.0% Non-binary/Non-conforming 0 0.0% Prefer not to answer 2 1.0% Total Responses 199   Note: One respondent selected both “woman” and “prefer not to answer”  Number of Respondents Percent of Respondents White 184 92.5% Black or African American 3 1.5% American Indian or Alaska Native 2 1.0% Asian 2 1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 0 0.0% Other 6 3.0% Prefer not to answer 2 1.0% Total Responses 199     147Table E3  Total respondents: Sexual Orientation   Number of Respondents Percent of Respondents Lesbian 32 16.1% Heterosexual 155 77.9% Gay 2 1.0% Bisexual 5 2.5% Asexual 0 0.0% Queer 1 0.5% Pansexual 1 0.5% Prefer not to answer 3 1.5% Total Responses 199        Table E4  Total respondents: What is your marital status?

    "abstract": "The purpose of this quantitative study was to understand the factors influencing the potential departure decisions of women coaches in Division III college athletics in the United States. More specifically, this research examined the relationship between gender stereotyping, work-family conflict, burnout, job satisfaction, and organizational support on the potential departure intentions of women coaches at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level. Moreover, the data collected were analyzed to understand how these relationships differed by sport, race, and sexual orientation. A total of 59.3% (n = 118) of respondents had considered leaving their coaching position within the last three years. Burnout as well as a combination of job satisfaction and organizational support had a statistically significant relationship with departure intentions within a regression model. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are included",
