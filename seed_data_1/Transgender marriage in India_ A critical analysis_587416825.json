AbstractThe liminal existence of  the transgender community has always been an unresolved issue in most countries where discrimination and exclusion from society are high. Despite ongoing efforts towards inclusivity, transgender individuals continue to face significant challenges, particularly in finding acceptance for their marriages amidst the existing legal, religious, and social contexts in their respective societies. This research paper focuses on highlighting one such challenge faced by transgenders in India in finding acceptance for their marriages amidst the existing legal, religious, and social situations in the country. Through an extensive review of  literature and content analysis, the findings of  the research suggest that the social stigma attached to transgender marriage, lack of  legal recognition, lack of  awareness of  discriminatory marginality, and traditionality enforced by the religious institutions in society cause consequences to the marriage among the transgender community. Besides, the lack of  family support, economic instability, and the challenges from intersectional streams make the situation worse. However, as the significance and relevance of  inclusiveness and equality in society is a major concern of  the present decade, empowerment and representation of  the transgender community, regardless of  their population strength, could help in achieving their requirements in society. Keywords:Liminality, Marriage, Same-sexmarriage, Sexuality, TransgenderReview ArticleTransgender marriage in India: A critical analysis of  the legal,social and religious scenariosRaisun Mathew Assistant Professor, Department of  English, Chinmaya Vishwa Vidyapeeth (Deemed-to-be University), Ernakulam, Kerala, IndiaDate of  Submission:31 March 2023Date of  Acceptance: 03 May 2023IntroductionThe transgender community has always been at the forefront of  social and political conversations globally for many reasons associated with the cause of  being victimised due to gender discrimination and exclusion from society. The yet unresolved issues around the world, despite efforts for significant changes, continue to have conflicts with the ideological standpoints of  the diverse cultural, 92legal, religious, and social institutions. The perception of  transgender individuals varies across cultures and societies. In some societies, they are viewed positively, while in others, they are stigmatised and discriminated against. In many countries, transgender individuals face legal challenges, including the lack of  legal recognition of  their gender identity, limited access to healthcare and other services, and discrimination in employment, education, and housing. The lack of  legal recognition of  their gender identity also affects their ability to marry and have families. transgender individuals also face physical violence and hate crimes globally. According to the Trans [1]Murder Monitoring Project , which tracks transgender murders globally, there were 375 transgender murders reported between October 2020 and September 2021. Among them, 96% were trans women or femmes. This indicates the severity of  the situation for transgender individuals globally. Research has shown that transgender women, who identify as women but were assigned male at birth, often experience significant discrimination and marginalisation in the workplace. This discrimination can manifest in various ways, including lower pay, lack of  job security, and fewer job opportunities. As a result, transgender women often face greater barriers to obtaining and maintaining employment than non-binary transgender individuals and transgender men. On the other hand, non-binary transgender individuals who do not exclusively identify as male or female and transgender men, who identify as male but were assigned female at birth, tend to experience similar outcomes in terms of  employment experiences. While they may still face discrimination and marginalisation in the workplace, they may not experience the same degree of  systemic discrimination as [2] transgender women. Despite these challenges, the transgender community has been actively working towards improving its situation globally. They have been advocating for legal recognition of  their gender identity, inclusion in healthcare and other services, and challenging societal norms that perpetuate stigma and discrimination.On historical accounts, the transgender community in India has been associated with religious and cultural practices. They were often seen as spiritual or mystical beings, and their blessings were considered auspicious. However, with the advent of  British colonialism in India, the perception of  the transgender community changed. The Criminal Tribes Act of  1871, enacted by the British in India, criminalised transgenders, and the imprisonment could be for up to two years [3]if  they dressed as a woman in public.  Although it was repealed later, the changed perspective remained the same. On September 2018, the Supreme Court of  India ruled that Section 377 of  the Indian Penal Code (1860) remains unconstitutional and suggested to read down as it penalises consensual sexual activity between two adults. Colonisation and the imposition of  Victorian morality continued to have an impact until a revision [4]was ruled.  However, with such efforts, the annulment of  Article 377 is ensured and legally permissible for consensual intercourse [5] for LGBTQ+ people. Under such prevailing circumstances of  the non-binary communities in various countries, the identity is always in question as it is being continuously equated with the majoritarian binary population. The research objective of  this study is to examine the challenges and struggles faced by the transgender community in India with respect to their marriages. It explores the legal, religious, and social obstacles that transgender individuals encounter in gaining acceptance for their marriages in the country. Besides, the research also examines how the non-binary community experiences discrimination and marginalisation that can lead to unhealthy criticism and targeted bullying. To achieve this objective, the research conducts an extensive literature review and interpretative content analysis of  media reports, articles, and legal 93documents so as to identify the challenges and struggles encountered by the transgender community in their pursuit of  marriage equality. The study is highly significant and relevant because continuous exploitation of  the non-binary gender groups occurs in different parts of  the country, of  which a few are only reported. Non-binary existence: The liminal status of  the transgender communityAccording to the American Psychological Association (APA), transgender is an umbrella term that refers to individuals whose gender identity, gender expression, or behaviour does not align with the sex they were assigned at [6,7] birth. This definition recognises that gender is not binary and that there is a wide spectrum of  gender identities and expressions that exist beyond traditional male and female categories. It is important to note that being transgender is not a choice or a mental disorder but rather a natural aspect of  human diversity. As the [8] World Health Organization (WHO) states, “Genderidentity and sexual orientation are integral aspects of  our selves and should never lead to discrimination or abuse”. Therefore, it is crucial to respect and support the rights of  transgender individuals, including their right to access healthcare, education, employment, and legal recognition of  their gender identity.Considering the majoritarian group of  binary gender, the extremity assigned by society is the male and the other female gender. What if  in between both extremes/not involved in either? The liminality of  gender is such a situation of  being neither one nor the other, or [9]both  wherein the identity experiences a sense of  in-betweenness or ‘betwixt and [10]between’ state , crisis and alienation. It either has the mixed characteristics of  both or gets excluded from showing any of  the binary extremes. Transgender individuals are often considered to be in a liminal category, meaning they occupy an intermediate or in-between state between the male and female genders. This existence of  the liminal condition is due to the fact that transgender individuals do not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth but instead identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex. This sense of  in-betweenness is further exacerbated by societal norms and expectations that reinforce binary gender categories. As stated by Judith Butler, “Gender is a performative act, something that is done rather than simply [11]innate or natural”.  This means that gender identity is not determined solely by biological sex but is also shaped by social and cultural factors. The liminality experienced by transgender individuals is a result of  the disjuncture between their gender identity and the gender roles and expectations assigned to their biological sex.However, does this gender liminality experienced by the non-binary community express its characteristics? The answer would be yes. The continuous exclusion, insecurity feelings, and discrimination from society may lead to traumatic experiences of  the uncertainty of  their normative existence, the anxiety of  how society would perceive their existence, and ambiguity on the same allowing the transformation of  social structures in an [12] individual. The liminal status of  individuals who do not conform to traditional gender roles or binary gender categories can create insecurity and vulnerability, particularly when that liminality is socially imposed and permanent. This continuous experience of  being on the threshold between different states of  being is a characteristic of  existing in [13,14] permanent liminality. This can be especially true for individuals who exhibit ambiguity in their gender presentation and [15]who may or may not identify as transgender.  However, the reality of  transgenders in India is much worse as they still face significant challenges, discrimination, limited access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, and many experience violence and harassment. Progress towards achieving 94equality and inclusion for the transgender community in India is slow and uneven, pointing to the existing myths about the [16]community leading to transphobia.The complexities of  Trans-marriage: exploring the legal and social challengesIndia has a long and complex history of  recognising and acknowledging transgender individuals, often referred to as hijras or kinnars. These individuals have been documented in ancient texts such as the Kama Sutra, the Mahabharata, and the Ramayana, and were often seen as occupying a unique, liminal space between male and female, sacred  [17] and profane according to the various beliefs.The imperative roles of  transgenders in the royal courtyards of  Mughal emperors and the [18]glories in the scriptures  point to the fact that they were treated way better than their existence in the past and present centuries. However, during the colonial era, British authorities criminalised hijra identities and practices, leading to their marginalisation and [19] persecution. In modern times, transgender individuals have gained some legal recognition and protections, most notably with the 2014 Supreme Court ruling that officially recognised a ‘third gender’ category and granted legal rights and protections to [20]transgender people.  It is evident from the Fundamental Rights (articles 14-16, 19(1), and 21) that the Constitution of  India provides a guarantee to the rights of  every citizen. Thus, Section 377 is a clear violation of  the Indian Penal Code. Despite these legal advancements, discrimination and violence against transgender individuals remain widespread in India. They often face challenges in accessing healthcare, employment, education, and [ 2 1 ]  hous ing. T he  soc i a l  s t i gma  and  discrimination that transgender individuals face can lead to mental health issues such as [22]depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.Transgender marriage is still a relatively new concept in India, and there are several social challenges that trans individuals face in their pursuit of  marriage. Currently, Indian law only recognises marriages between a man and a woman, effectively excluding transgender [23] individuals from marriage rights. This legal barrier is rooted in the binary gender system prevalent in India, which only recognises male and female genders and excludes the existence of  transgender individuals. Because of  the reason that legal institutions do not accept transgender marriage, the social stigma and discrimination are high. Transgender individuals in India are often ostracised by their families and communities, making it [24]difficult to find a partner who accepts them.  Even within the LGBTQ+ community, transgender individuals face discrimination, as they are often seen as less desirable partners [ 2 5 ]  than cisgender individuals. Several  organisations have been working towards creating awareness about transgender rights and advocating for legal recognition of  transgender marriages. One such organisation is the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA)which took forward the issue, where the Supreme Court in 2014, in the case NALSA vs Union of  India and others, recognised transgender individuals as a ‘third gender’ and called for their inclusion in all [26,27]aspects of  society, including marriage.  Prior to this and after, there have been interventions from various courts in the country. Some of  them are the Delhi High Court Judgement (2019), the Supreme Court Judgment (2013), the Rights of  the Transgender Persons Bill (2014), and the decriminalisation of  Section 377 of  the Indian Penal Code by the Supreme Court (2018). In 2019, the Madras High Court called for the recognition of  transgender marriages under the Hindu Marriage Actof  1955, marking a significant step towards the legal recognition [28]of  transgender marriages in India. [29]According to Shaji , a few transgender women in India have managed to register their marriages by identifying as male or female in their documentation. The report quotes the 95experience of  Maya SR Nayak, a transgender woman who was cheated on by her husband by getting married to a cis woman. She could not go to the police as her marriage does not stay valid under the existing law in the country. Although the number of  such marriages is small, they face uncertainty about the legality of  their marriages if  challenged in court. This arises because of  the existing legal formality that defines marriage as a contract between a man and a woman. The plaintiffs in a case for same-sex marriage for a Constitutional review before the court in India claim discrimination, as they are denied the same rights and benefits as heterosexual married couples. These include inheritance, health directives, property ownership, and starting a family through Indian surrogacy. While the Supreme Court previously rejected a marriage equality challenge in 2020, it has since expanded protections for ‘a typical’ [30]families, including same-sex couples.  Some activists remained cautious, but many were hopeful that a final decision would soon grant equal marriage rights to all individuals in India. Quoting the case of  Supriyo and Abhay, the petition says that despite having the freedom to love each other, the transgenders still cannot have a happy marriage and suggests that equality must extend to all spheres of  life, especially for LGBTQ+ citizens who form  7-[31]8 %  of  the population of  the country.  Another notable incident of  breaking gender stereotypes is the first legally married transgender bride in West Bengal, Shree Ghatak, and Sanjay Muhuri, in 2015. It was possible only because Shree underwent sex reassignment surgery and was able to provide the necessary documents to prove her transition. If  they were not able to provide enough supporting evidence to the authorities, their marriage would not have been approved. Here lies the significance of  considering the marriage of  transgender individuals in the country. When the existing law only approves marriages between a male and a female who are considered to be in the binary category of  gender, the individuality and freedom to express one’s sexual orientation are hindered. Even though there needs no special law for marriages between individuals who state themselves as among the binary gender, transgenders who have undergone their reassignment surgery are also made into uncertainty and legal complications. Ranjita Sinha, a transgender activist, points out clearly that there is no law that allows such transgender individuals to marry, but transwoman marriages do not come under this category and do not require any special sanction as they are categorised as women [32]under the marriage act.  Unusualness in the marriage: Social media bullying and criticismIn the contemporary world of  technological advancement, discussions and debates have been confined itself  to the parallel online medium wherein the involvement and influence of  social media in projecting the positive and negative aspects of  an event is high. The desperations of  individuals in a society that pretends to be forward-minded and inclusive are evident in social media as they pretend to be themselves, with or without declaring their identity. Biased-based bullying is found to have more effects of  victimisation on negative outcomes compared to non-biased-based victimisation. The levels of  depression, alienation, suicidal ideation, attempts of  suicide, substance use, and [33, 34] truancy tend to be high in such a form of  biased-based and targeted bullying in social media. Recently, though the frontline media reported the parenthood of  a trans couple in Kerala whose pregnancy photos had gone viral, many comments and views on various social media platforms were against it by questioning their identity. The couple responded, “Though there are many negative comments, we focus only on the positive [35] parts”. Though termed as transgender marriage and pregnancy, this does not satisfy 96the requirements of  transgenders their right to get married in the identity of  transgender because Ziya Paval and Zahhad underwent hormone therapy to change their genders into the binary identity. Contrary to this is the case of  Manu Karthika and Syama S. Prabha who had to approach the High Court of  Kerala to register their marriage under the Special Marriage Act in the status of  transgender identity instead of  the [36] gender binary. They were identified as transgender in their identity cards, unlike the cards that identify other transgenders as male or female. However, there is a continuous struggle for transgender couples to get formal acceptance and legal approval for their marriages. As marriage in India is usually governed by a set of  laws tailored by religious groups, the Special Marriage Act becomes the secular law and hope for people of  the transgender community. Utkarsh Saxena and Ananya Kotia, a gay couple, have filed a petition to the Supreme Court of  India seeking [37] the legalisation of  same-sex marriage.Although this does not relate to transgender marriage, while considering the LGBTQ+ issues as a whole, especially their marriage, this attempt is highly relevant. Though it takes much time and complications to achieve it, constant efforts from individuals and groups would help to highlight the importance of  such amendments that comply with the morale and essence of  the constitution and the legal system. Religious perspectives: Non-binary challengesWhile discussing the religious perspectives on non-binary transgender marriages, it cannot be represented as the viewpoint of  all individuals or communities within the religions, as there is a great deal of  diversity and complexity within each tradition. These also depend on the regional cultural factors that shape attitudes toward transgender marriage. However, in general, a majority of  religions oppose same-sex marriage. From the Christian conservative perspective, transgender identity itself  is a violation of  God’s intended gender binary and therefore opposes transgender marriage. Although this is the case, Pope Francis has declared homosexuality as not a crime and urged Catholics to welcome LGBTQ members to the church and [38] supported civil unions for same-sex couples. But, this statement does not accept same-sex marriage and considers same-sex marriage as a threat to the family structure. In comparison, there are denominations and communities such as the United Church of  Christ and the Episcopal Church that accept all categories of   non-binary communities and their marriages.[39] Islamic teachings generally affirm the binary understanding of  gender and biological sex, but there is also a recognition of  the diversity of  human experiences and identities. There is no specific mention of  transgender marriage in the Quran, but some Muslim scholars argue that gender reassignment surgery can be permissible under certain circumstances. However, the majority of  Muslim communities still hold traditional views on gender and do not accept transgender individuals and their relationships. In Hinduism, there is a recognition of  the diversity of  human experiences and identities, including gender non-conformity. The Hindu deity Ardhanari-shvara, for example, is depicted as a half-male, half-female being, representing the unity and interdependence of  masculine and feminine energies. This portrayal of  divinity suggests that gender is not a fixed and immutable category but rather a fluid and dynamic aspect [40] of  human existence. The Kama Sutra, a Hindu text on sexuality, also acknowledges the existence of  transgender individuals and provides guidance on how to treat them with respect and understanding. The text emphasises the importance of  mutual consent and pleasure in sexual relationships, regardless of  the gender identities of  the partners involved. Despite these progressive attitudes towards gender diversity, there are also 97tradit ional  and conser vative Hindu perspectives that view transgender identities and relationships as outside the norm. Some Hindu communities may be reluctant to accept transgender marriages, particularly those that are not aligned with traditional gender roles and expectations. In recent years, there have been efforts by some Hindu organisations and leaders to promote greater inclusivity and support for transgender individuals and their relationships. For example, in 2017, the Kinnar Akhara, a transgender Hindu monastic order, was recognised by the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, a council of  Hindu monastic orders, as a legitimate spiritual group.The traditionality and orthodox mentality associated with religions, in general, could be a reason for not being accepted. It also depends on the people in the power positions of  the religion and their decisions. This conventional nature of  the religious institutions is sometimes adamant in their decision for which a strong base of  religious texts and doctrines are considered to substantiate. The incident of  declining permission for Neelankrishna and Adwaika, a transgender couple from Kerala, by the authorities of  the Kachamkurissy temple in the district of  Palakkad is an example. They refused permission for the couple for the traditional ‘thaalikettu’, stating the reason that there was no precedence for [41]transgender marriage in the temple.  Legal Scenario Social Scenario Religious ScenarioIn India, current marriage laws only acknowledge heterosexual unions, which unfortunately does not provide marriage rights to transgender individuals. Transgender individuals in India frequently encounter social ostracism and discrimination, which can make it challenging for them to pursue marriage. Their families, friends, and co mmunities may oppose their decision to marry, further adding to the challenges they face. Religious views on transgender marriages in India are diverse, with some accepting all non-binary communities, while others do not recogni se transgender individuals and their relationships due to traditional gender views. Transgender individuals in India who have undergone hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery are not impacted by the current marriage laws. However, those who haven't undergone such procedures may face legal obstacles in obtaining marriage rights, as their pleas for transgender marriages have been denied.Transgender individuals in India are often subjected to social media bullying and criticism, which can have significant psychological and emotio nal consequences for both individuals and their families. The prevalence of  such behaviour further highlights the challenges faced by the transgender community in India. Although certain Hindu texts promote progressive views towards gender diversity, there are also traditional and conservative Hindu beliefs that consider transgender identities and relationships to be deviating from societal norms.When the existing law only approves marriages between a male and a female who are considered to be in the bina ry category of  gender, the individuality and freedom to express one’s sexual orientation are hindered. Given that marriage laws in India are typically influenced by religious customs, the Special Marriage Act serves as a secular alternative and a beacon of hope for transgender individuals seeking marriage rights. Some religious groups limit transgender marriages by citing the absence of  historical precedence for such unions within their traditions. The existing marriage laws in India limit individuality and hinder the freedom to express one's sexual orientation, as they only allow marriages between individuals who identify as male and female and conform to the gender binary system. This can be particularly challengingfor individuals who identify as trans gender or non- binary.Non-binary communities globally continue to confront persistent challenges to their identity, including societal comparisons to the binary majority population, and a lack of  full acceptance and recognition within society. The traditio nal nature of  religious institutions in India, combined with the attitudes of  influential figures within these institutions, may pose a substantial obstacle to the acknowledg ement and acceptance of  transgender marriages.Table 1: social, and religious scenariosCritical elements: Legal, 98ConclusionBased on the preceding discussion, it can be inferred that the provision of  constitutional rights to citizens by a country necessitates their equal availability to all segments of  society, irrespective of  their gender and sexual orientation. The restriction of  marriage rights to non-binary classifications of  humans impedes the expression of  their individuality and creates an institutional contract exclusively accessible to a majority group that does not identify as liminal gender. Although this research has considered only a few incidents involving transgender individuals, their experiences are indicative of  the community’s shared struggles. Identifying the liminal status of  the transgender community through this research reveals the identity crises and alienation they face throughout their lives, which is also reflected in the challenges and obstacles associated with transgender marriage in India. The legal, social, and religious repercussions faced by transgender individuals stem from a failure to adopt wider perspectives and uphold the values of  equality, inclusion, and diversity. Much has been discussed and debated over time on this, and what is required for a decade that has witnessed several changes is an action to protect the rights of  the marginalised section.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThe liminal existence of the transgender community has\n\nalways been an unresolved issue in most countries where\n\ndiscrimination and exclusion from society are high. Despite\n\nongoing efforts towards inclusivity, transgender individuals\n\ncontinue to face significant challenges, particularly in\n\nfinding acceptance for their marriages amidst the existing\n\nlegal, religious, and social contexts in their respective\n\nsocieties. This research paper focuses on highlighting one\n\nsuch challenge faced by transgenders in India in finding\n\nacceptance for their marriages amidst the existing legal,\n\nreligious, and social situations in the country. Through an\n\nextensive review of literature and content analysis, the\n\nfindings of the research suggest that the social stigma\n\nattached to transgender marriage, lack of legal recognition,\n\nlack of awareness of discriminatory marginality, and\n\ntraditionality enforced by the religious institutions in\n\nsociety cause consequences to the marriage among the\n\ntransgender community. Besides, the lack of family\n\nsupport, economic instability, and the challenges from\n\nintersectional streams make the situation worse. However,\n\nas the significance and relevance of inclusiveness and\n\nequality in society is a major concern of the present decade,\n\nempowerment and representation of the transgender\n\ncommunity, regardless of their population strength, could\n\nhelp in achieving their requirements in society",
