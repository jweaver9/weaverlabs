The roles of individual family members, and in particular siblings, have been found to be an important factor in enabling positive mental health outcomes for individuals who identify as gender diverse. This systematic literature review aimed to identify and review existing findings in research regarding transgender sibling relationships. A thorough literature review was conducted across three online databases relevant to transgender research. The systematic search strategy yielded 58 sample studies, which were subject to extensive review. Of these, seven studies were found to meet the review inclusion criteria. A summary and critical evaluation of these seven studies is presented. Consistent with previous suggestions, the review highlighted the significance of individual family member relationships in influencing transgender individuals’ experiences of anxiety, depression, and general psychological distress. The review builds upon previous literature by highlighting the unique role that siblings can play in shaping trans individuals’ experiences of acceptance and affirmation and subsequent mental health outcomes. These findings suggest that further research into sibling relationships within the context of gender diversity is warranted and that mental health professionals should consider the whole family system when developing and delivering therapeutic interventions.    TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 8 Introduction This review explores the impact of sibling relationships on the wellbeing of those who identify as transgender. Previous research has suggested that familial support and acceptance is important in facilitating psychological wellbeing and psychosocial outcomes for individuals who identify as gender diverse. However, few researchers have specifically examined the role of siblings in influencing the experience of gender diversity and the impact of this relationship on subsequent physical, psychological and social outcomes for those who identify as trans. To address this gap, the current paper will systematically review research that investigates the relationship between sibling relationships, transgender identity, and transgender wellbeing.  In recent years, transgender identity has received increasing attention and interest across many social, educational and political fields (Kaltiala-Heino et al., 2018). The word ‘transgender’ is an umbrella term, used to describe anyone whose gender identity does not align with the sex that they were assigned at birth (American Psychiatric Association (APA), 2015). This is in contrast to the term ‘cisgender’, which denotes those whose gender identity is in line with their natal sex. In this way, notions of gender and sex differ; in that sex is considered biological and gender is generally considered to be a cultural construct (Stryker, 2017). It is important to note that transgender identity is not limited to the traditional gender binary, however, as many who identify as transgender do not feel they are exclusively masculine or feminine. A number of differing terminologies exist to help to encapsulate the full spectrum of the transgender experience. These include, but are not limited to, ‘trans’, ‘transgender’, ‘transsexual’, ‘non-binary’, ‘gender queer’, TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 9 ‘trans male and trans female’, ‘gender diverse’, and ‘gender variant’. Importantly, transgender identity is independent of sexual orientation. In the UK, it is estimated that approximately 0.4% of the general population identify under the ‘transgender umbrella’, although it is noted that this figure may be significantly higher when surveying younger populations (Reed et al., 2009). Across the last five years, gender identity services (GIS) have experienced an 240% increase in referrals (Press Association, 2019); with estimated waiting times rising to over 18 months (Donnelly, 2019). Moreover, increased numbers of young people referred to GIS have been observed to identify as non-binary and in more gender fluid ways (Miller & Davidson, 2019). This widening of gender identities, as well as increased social visibility and trans social media influences, may help to explain the unprecedented increase in GIS referrals within the UK and other western countries (Di Ceglie, 2018). Nevertheless, this increase presents clinicians working within GIS with unique challenges, which can create ethical and clinical dilemmas for clinicians; generating anxiety around decision making, which may lead to unhelpful action or inaction (Di Ceglie, 2018).  There are a number of reasons why those who identify as transgender may seek the support of healthcare professionals. Trans individuals can often experience a sense of ‘gender incongruence’; in that they feel a discordance between their personal sense of who they are and their biological sex (APA, 2015). Persons may therefore seek support in relation to their gender incongruence, decisions regarding gender transition, or to explore potential gender-affirming surgical options (Winter et al., 2016). ‘Gender dysphoria’ refers to the distress that an individual may experience as a result of gender incongruence and encompasses both social and physical discordance (APA, 2015). Whilst some trans individuals may experience very little or TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 10 no dysphoria, for others the level of distress may be severe and can negatively impact upon their psychological wellbeing and day-to-day functioning (Di Ceglie, 2018). It is noted that the notion of wellbeing can be difficult to define and can be measured in innumerable ways (Forgeard et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the World Health Organization (WHO, 2013) defines overall health as a “state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” that seems appropriate to our current understanding. With regards to transgender wellbeing, health outcomes within the trans population are often negatively affected and include higher rates of HIV, smoking, and drug and alcohol abuse (Sandil et al., 2017), as well as an increased risk of suicide in comparison to cisgender populations (Winter et al., 2016). The way in which individuals who identify as trans are perceived and received by others is important in influencing wellbeing. Transgender individuals can be viewed by society as sexually deviant, morally corrupt, or mentally disordered (Winter et al., 2009) and risk facing systemic oppression and devaluation as a result of the stigma associated with their gender nonconformity (Winter et al., 2016). What is more, those who identify as trans are also at an increased risk of experiencing discrimination (Clements-Nolle et al., 2006), verbal and physical abuse (Hyde et al., 2013), and unemployment and poverty (Nuttbrock et al., 2010) further impacting upon experiences of wellbeing.  The sibling bond is theorised to be an important factor in promoting wellbeing, and in particular enabling socio-emotional development, and is highlighted for its uniqueness in often existing throughout a person’s lifespan (Haxhe et al., 2018). Bank and Kahn (1982) define the sibling relationship as an integration of two people’s identities and personalities during childhood and into adulthood. It is noted TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 11 that approximately 80% to 90% of individuals grow up with at least one sibling (Circirelli, 1982). In the general field of sibling studies, prominent researchers have similarly highlighted the importance of sibling relationships in the development of social, emotional and relational skills (Feinberg et al., 2013; Sulloway, 2010). What is more, sibling relationships are important sources of support and companionship, although it is noted that this relationship may also be characterised by conflict and competition at varying times (Furman & Buhrmester, 1985). Research suggests that sibling relationships may be impacted by changes to one member’s identity. For instance, Dunn (1992) explored how this relationship can be affected when one member experiences a significant change in identity because of disability, physical illness or mental health issues and found that siblings can become helpful supporters and influences during such times of change. Conversely, Fisman et al (2000) conducted a longitudinal study into the impact of chronic childhood disability on the affected individual’s sibling. The authors concluded that siblings of children with pervasive developmental disorder may experience high levels of distress and depression and that these symptoms can persist over time (Fisman et al., 2000). Nonetheless, research exploring the sibling relationship within the context of gender identity changes remains limited (Lamb, 2014). Within the field of transgender research, it appears that gender diversity affects everyone in the family in varied, complex and often covert ways (Westwater et al., 2020). Despite increasing research into the individual mental health needs of transgender individuals, however, much less is known about individual and collective family member experiences of gender dysphoria, particularly for siblings (Newcomb et al., 2019; Westwater et al., 2020; Wheeler et al., 2019). At present, existing systemic transgender literature focuses primarily upon the father-mother-child family TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 12 triad, as opposed to the wider family context (Gregor et al., 2016). In addition, siblings are readily forgotten by professionals working within GIS; leaving the roles and perspectives of siblings relatively unheard (Ehrensaft, 2011). Rationale Given the unparalleled increase in GIS referrals, the long waits for appointments at GIS, the impact of gender diversity on both family relationships and transgender individuals health and wellbeing, as well as the lack of research concerning the role of siblings in influencing transgender wellbeing, understanding the impact of sibling relationships within the context of gender diversity is important.  Aims of the Review The current literature review aimed to systemically identify, appraise and summarise all literature that explores the role of siblings in understanding the experiences and wellbeing of transgender individuals. Due to the small but emergent literature available, the review included sibling relationships across both childhood and adulthood.  Specifically, the review research question asked:  • In what ways do sibling relationships impact upon transgender wellbeing? Method A systematic search of the literature was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) principles (Moher et al., 2009). The literature review followed a five-step process of literature search, identification, data evaluation, data analysis and presentation of integrated findings.  TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 13 Search Terms In order to ensure relevant literature was captured, a range of search terms, synonyms and Boolean techniques using ‘AND/OR’ operators were utilised (see Table 1). The search terms were identified following an initial scoping search of the relevant literature. Given the variation in terms used to describe gender diversity, multiple search terms were included. Finally, a range of terms relating to physical, psychological and social wellbeing were also incorporated.  Table 1 Search Terms Transgender Gender divers* Gender dysphoria Gender variant Gender queer Gender identity disorder Non-binary Transsexual* Transgender* LGBT* Sibling Sibling Brother Sister Wellbeing Acceptance Anxiety Depression Happiness Health Growth Mental health Mental wellbeing Psychosocial QoL Quality of life Suicide Wellbeing Well-being TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 14 Search Strategy Three chosen databases (PsycINFO, SAGE Journals and Web of Science) were searched on 8th January 2020. These databases were selected due to their relevance to Psychology and wider related fields. All searches were conducted within the title and abstract domains, in order to ensure that the literature obtained related to the key concepts as defined by the research question. Searches were initially conducted in the full text; however, this was found to be ineffective since the articles retrieved were generally irrelevant to this literature review (e.g. focused upon sexual orientation as opposed to gender, focused on parental relationships but not siblings).  The inclusion and exclusion criteria used for the review are detailed in Table 2 below. Only papers that made explicit reference to sibling relationships within the context of transgender wellbeing were selected for this review. Due to the relative novelty of this area of research and the subsequent small database, qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies were included. The search included peer-reviewed journal articles published in English and was limited to papers published after 1966; at which point the first GIS was opened.

The reference lists of eligible studies were also reviewed to identify any additional relevant articles, although this did not yield any other articles. All articles underwent a preliminary screening process, which involved reading the title and abstract to determine whether they met criteria for inclusion. Consequently, 586 articles were excluded. The remaining 58 were subject to a full-text appraisal to further establish their eligibility. Seven articles were identified as fulfilling all inclusion criteria and are detailed in Table 3. Moreover, in order to assess the reliability of this selection, the seven papers were reviewed in full by an independent second-rater (a fellow trainee Clinical Psychologist), using the PICOS criteria. There was 100% inter-rater agreement between the two authors for inclusion of these studies.

This tool was TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 18 chosen as it permits the appraisal of five different categories of study design within one tool, namely: (a) qualitative, (b) randomized controlled, (c) nonrandomized, (d)  quantitative descriptive and (e) mixed methods (Hong et al., 2018). The MMAT includes a total of 25 criteria and two screening questions (see Figure 2). Scores are displayed in Table 3 below. In order to ensure reliability of scoring, three of the included papers were also reviewed and scored by an independent second-rater (a different fellow trainee Clinical Psychologist). Inter-rater reliability was calculated to be k= 0.8 therefore suggesting substantial agreement between the two raters. Any disagreements in scoring were discussed and considered, and final scores were agreed upon.

The analysis of qualitative evidence alongside quantitative data was felt to provide a better understanding of the contextual factors that are important for individuals and families who experience gender diversity. As noted by Pluye et al (2019), synthesising evidence from qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies can be a complementary process; in enabling a corroboration of knowledge through providing a deeper understanding of quantitative evidence and a statistical generalisation of findings from qualitative evidence, for instance. Nevertheless, this process was also found to be lengthy and careful consideration needed to be given as to which review design to choose, based upon the questions that emerged in conducting this synthesis (Noyes et al., 2019).

In addition, caregiver indifference and sibling acceptance (independent of caregiver acceptance and rejection) were likewise associated with mental health outcomes in transgender youth.  Sibling information was more limited than information related to caregiver acceptance.  The acceptance coding system was used solely for the purpose of this exploratory study and is not a measure that has been tested for reliability or validity.

Developing an increased understanding of transgender issues appears to enable young people to embrace more supportive roles and enhances gender-diverse sibling relationships. However, increased understanding of transgender issues can also generate significant fears and concerns about their siblings’ wellbeing The population sample solely comprised siblings of families who were actively seeking support from GIS.

Transgender individuals’ perspectives were not included.  Study 7: Westwater et al., (2020) To identify, describe and interpret individual family member experiences of youth gender dysphoria within a family context.  Semi-structured interviews Inductive thematic analysis.  Australia Gender diverse children and young people and their individual family members (siblings and parents).  Total n=35 from ten family units: 18 parents (8 fathers, 10 mothers, aged 38 – 58 years), 8 siblings (6 brothers, 2 sisters, age range 11 – 17 years) and 9 young people experiencing gender dysphoria (5 assigned male at birth, 4 assigned female at birth, age range 12 – 17 years).  Most research participants identified as being “white/ Caucasian”, from an Australian or European background, with one young person identifying as “mixed English/Maori” and five parents identifying as American (n=2), Hispanic, French and Maori.  Most family members were not affiliated with a particular religion, although one family identified strongly with a Christian faith.    All participants reported a mixture of positive and negative experiences of youth gender dysphoria.  Levels of acceptance tended to change with the duration of transition, with most family members adapting with time.  Siblings reported mixed experiences within the same family, with some struggling to adapt.  Most family members felt that including the whole family in the healthcare of the young person was important, although dependent on individual circumstances and family context.  The study findings are limited by the relatively small number of family member participants. The study specifically focused on youth experiencing gender dysphoria and will therefore not necessarily be transferable to youth experiencing gender diversity.  The results are biased toward female- identifying young people experiencing gen- der dysphoria.    TRANSGENDER WELLBEING AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS 26   Specialist gender care experiences were unanimously positive, although services were considered difficult to access.   Study Aims All studies, to varying degrees, examined the impact of sibling relationships on the experiences of gender diverse individuals. Understanding the sibling relationship in the context of gender diversity was the central aim in two of the selected studies (3 and 6). Several studies examined the impact of familial relationships (including siblings) on transgender individual’s experiences of anxiety and depression (1, 2, 4). One study was interested in how gender transition impacts upon significant others (including siblings) in the trans individual’s life (5). Two studies additionally explored the role of family members (including siblings) in generating feelings of acceptance for trans individuals (4 and 7). One study was interested in the impact of siblings on sexual minority youths, including those who identify as transgender (3).  Study Sample A total of 832 individuals participated across the seven studies and sample sizes varied considerably. Of these, 306 participants identified under the transgender umbrella and 176 participants were siblings of those who identified as transgender. A number of studies also included parents (1, 4,5 and 7), partners (4 and 5) and friends (5) of those who identify as trans. Two studies additionally included control groups consisting of those who either do not identify as trans nor have a sibling who identifies in this way (1 and 2). In addition, one study also included individuals who identify as lesbian, gay and bisexual (3). Of note, despite still meeting the PICOS criteria, two of the studies selected did not include trans participants (5 and 6), whilst a further two studies did not directly involve sibling participants (3 and 4).  Participant ages ranged from 3 to 54 years old, with three studies focusing on those aged below 18 years of age (1, 2 and 4), two studies focusing on those over GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  28 18 (3 and 5) and two studies including both child and adult perspectives (6 and 7). Participants largely identified as White (see Table 4 for precise demographic information) and were generally recruited through gender identity support groups and GIS.  Study Design Of the seven studies selected, four collected data through questionnaires, surveys and other self-report measures (1, 2, 3 and 4) and four utilised semi-structured interviews (4, 5, 6 and 7). One paper (4) employed a longitudinal design in which data was collected over a four-year period, whilst all other studies adopted a cross-sectional design.  Measures utilised in order to collect data included the National Institute of Health’s Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scale (1 and 2), the Sibling Closeness Scale (SCS; 3), the Sibling Approval of Sexual Behaviour Scale (SASBS; 3), the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI; 4), the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale 1st Edition (RCMAS-1; 4), and the Youth Self-Report (YSR; 4).  Limitations and Bias A number of limitations were identified within the chosen research studies. Firstly, trans participants tended to display binary gender identities and therefore identified exclusively as either “trans male” or “trans female”. As a consequence, it is difficult to generalise findings from these studies to individuals who identify as gender fluid, non-binary or both male and female, therefore limiting understanding of the broader trans experience. Similarly, Wheeler et al (2019) and Westwater et al (2020) noted gender biases within their sample populations; in that both sibling and trans participants were more likely to identify as female than male, again limiting generalizability.   GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  29 Second, the majority of studies recruited participants through child GIS. As such, it is difficult to generalise findings from these studies to adult trans populations and those who have not received support from specialist GIS. As noted by Pariseau et al (2019) and Durwood et al (2017), children who socially transition invariably have at least one parent who is supportive of their gender identity, which therefore allows them to publicly present as their identified gender and to access specialist support. Therefore, young people and their families who are recruited via GIS may differ to the larger population of transgender youth and adults due to this proactive level of support. As such, findings from these studies may reflect greater experiences of familial support and acceptance than is represented within the broader transgender community.  Moreover, since the majority of identified studies focused upon transgender youth populations, it is therefore difficult to generalise such findings to adult transgender populations. As noted by Durwood et al (2017), it is possible that social gender transitions in childhood occur alongside various kinds of social support, which may not be as readily available in adulthood. What is more, the majority of children who socially transition have not yet developed secondary sex characteristics, which can cause them to be perceived as their natal sex by others. As such, it may be an easier process for children who have not yet been through puberty to be perceived as their identified gender than it is for post pubescent adolescents and adults, simply by changing their clothing and hairstyle, for instance (Durwood et al., 2017). Furthermore, five of the seven selected studies were conducted within the United States of America (USA) and may therefore be unrepresentative of sibling relationships within the UK. For instance, in a recent report on public opinion regarding transgender rights in the USA (Luhur et al., 2019), it was found that GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  30 American adults (aged 18 to 64) were largely supportive of transgender rights across numerous policy areas and tended to hold positive attitudes and beliefs towards trans individuals. In this report, 72.7% of participants agreed that trans individuals should be protected from discrimination and 70.5% agreed that transgender people should be allowed to have gender affirming surgery (Luher et al., 2019). In contrast to this, in a 2020 UK YouGov poll regarding attitudes towards trans people, only 50% to 27% of Britons agreed that people should be allowed to self-identify as a gender different to the one that they were assigned at birth, and it was noted that this figure had declined slightly since 2019 (56% to 23%). Moreover, this survey highlighted distinct groupings of opinion dependent upon respondents’ political beliefs, as well as their gender and age. For instance, younger people (aged 18 – 24), women, and Labour, Lib Dem and Remain voters were more likely to hold positive attitudes towards trans peoples’ than Conservative and Leave voters, men, and older individuals (Smith, 2020). These findings highlight cross cultural differences in attitudes towards trans individuals and the nuanced factors that inform and influence understanding and beliefs. Further research to understand attitudes towards gender diversity in sibling relationships within the UK is therefore warranted.   Finally, conducting the quality appraisal checks using the MMAT also identified a number of limitations. A number of studies used measures for which there was conflicting information with regards to the reliability and validity of such measures. For instance, both measures used by Toomey and Richardson (2009) were adapted specifically for the purposes of this study (the SCS and the SASBS). While such adaptations may be necessary, the possibility of replication is compromised when these revisions are not explicitly described or justified. Whilst holding good internal consistency, the CDI has historically received criticism with regards to test-retest reliability and variability in terms of scores between intervals GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  31 and populations (Saylor et al., 1984). These issues therefore become problematic when researchers make generalisation claims from their findings and need to be more explicitly considered when discussing findings.   Moreover, study findings and conclusions showed some risk of bias. For instance, Pariseau et al (2019) developed their own coding system for analysing clinical interview data. Whilst this analysis was grounded in interpersonal acceptance-rejection theory (IPARTheory; Khaleque & Ali, 2017) and therefore offered interesting theory-practice links, it may be suggested that this creative approach enabled an overly optimistic interpretation of the data. Similarly, Whitley (2013) did not state what method of analysis was used, therefore making accurate replication of the study near impossible and evaluating the trustworthiness of the research process difficult. Finally, all studies that made predictions found support for at least some of these, therefore blurring the boundary between observed clinical data and theoretical interpretations.  Main Findings and Implications A number of key findings and themes in relation to transgender wellbeing and sibling relationships were identified across the selected studies. These include mental health, acceptance, and impact of gender transition upon significant others.  Mental Health Findings related to mental health were identified in three studies. Interestingly, Durwood et al (2017) found no differences in self-reported depressive or anxiety symptoms across the three participant groups (transgender, sibling, controls). In line with this, parents’ reports of their children’s experiences of depression and anxiety largely mirrored their children’s own reports, although the parents of transgender children did report slightly higher anxiety in their children than the children themselves (Durwood et al., 2017). Olson et al (2016) similarly found that socially GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  32 transitioned children displayed typical rates of depression and only slightly elevated rates of anxiety symptoms compared with population averages. In addition, these participants did not differ on either measure from their own siblings nor from the group of age- and gender-matched controls. Moreover, Westwater et al (2020) demonstrated a correlation between trans youths’ perceived wellbeing by parents and siblings, and affirmation of that young person’s gender identity from others.  Acceptance A number of studies noted the importance of acceptance and rejection in facilitating the psychological wellbeing of individuals who identify as transgender. For instance, Pariseau et al (2019) found that lower acceptance rates from siblings and mothers were significantly related to negative psychological outcomes in transgender youth. In addition, higher levels of indifference from fathers, was associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and internalizing and externalizing problems for trans youths. Interestingly, the researchers observed variable levels of acceptance by siblings of transgender youths; with 8.6% showing low acceptance/high rejection, 28.6% showing mixed acceptance and rejection, and 62.9% showing high acceptance/low rejection. In support of these findings, in a study looking at self-worth in socially transitioned transgender youths, societal rejection and the perceived need for identity repression or denial was linked to poorer mental wellbeing for those who identify as transgender (Durwood et al., 2017).  The notion of acceptance was also explored by Whitley (2013) across a number of differing contexts. The need for family members to feel accepted within religious communities was identified as an important factor in alleviating internalised stigma and shame with regards to having a trans child. Similarly, the need for family members to redefine their own identity in order to accept the identity of a transgender loved one was also explored. Whitley (2013) noted how for some GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  33 participants, this involved a process of having to “undo gender” by resisting normative gender constructions in order to accept their transgender partner and confront challenges to their existing sexual orientation, as well as using inventive measures to reconfigure normative gender dynamics and “redoing gender” within their relationships. Westwater et al (2020) similarly identified varying levels of acceptance and support from those outside of the immediate family setting. However, making connections with other gender diverse individuals and families was found to be associated with increased feelings of belonging, understanding and affirmation.  Finally, in a study exploring how young people make sense of their sibling’s gender diversity, differing participant narratives suggests that the process of acceptance is gradual for some, whilst for others it can be more sudden and triggered by specific events (Wheeler et al., 2019). Acceptance of their sibling’s gender diversity indicated a significant turning point in which young people developed a deeper empathy for their trans siblings and shifted their focus from the impact of disclosure on themselves, to providing more active support for their gender diverse siblings (Wheeler et al., 2019).  Impact on Others Change and adjustment for family members was a common theme, and in particular was highlighted within participant interviews conducted by Wheeler et al (2019) and Westwater et al (2020). As identified by Westwater et al (2020), younger siblings adapted more easily than older siblings to their trans sibling’s gender transition. Interestingly, Toomey and Richardson (2009) found that when sisters and brothers were combined, siblings represented the largest number of first disclosures in the family for their sample of LGBT youth. A key finding by Wheeler et al (2019) was the sense of confusion experienced by all eight of their participants on hearing GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  34 about their sibling’s gender diversity. Importantly, seven of the eight participants reported not knowing what the term ‘transgender’ meant at the time of their sibling’s disclosure, thus adding to their sense of confusion. However, all participants reported having an increased knowledge of transgender and gender diversity issues through accessing information over time and consequently felt they were more accepting of diversity issues in general, as a result of having a gender diverse sibling (Wheeler et al., 2009). The notion of increased understanding and insight, as well as personal and collective growth, was likewise identified by Westwater et al (2020). Nevertheless, despite the overarching theme of support, Wheeler et al (2019) highlighted feelings of resentment for some sibling participants in feeling that their gender diverse siblings were unappreciative of the sacrifices that they and their wider families were making in adjusting to their affirmed gender identity. Discussion This systematic review demonstrates the aforementioned increase in understanding of transgender wellbeing and relationships within the research literature, as well as the more general increase in individuals presenting with gender-related issues across services and support groups. It is noteworthy that the studies included within this review were all published within the last 12 years, therefore demonstrating the ongoing learning that needs to take place within this field. Given the increased social acceptability and visibility of transgender individuals and their families, a strength of the selected studies was their focus upon the wider social and systemic environments that inevitability influence transgender individuals’ sense of themselves and their wellbeing. The use of interviews, observation and self-report measures across the selected studies allowed for deeper insight into the individual and familial experiences of the participants involved. Indeed, recent studies have highlighted a perceived lack of professional knowledge or support, particularly in GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  35 relation to a whole family approach to supporting trans individuals (Dierckx & Platero, 2018; von Doussa et al., 2017) and thus such studies are important.  It is interesting that a number of the chosen studies demonstrated normative mental health outcomes for gender diverse children. This is in contrast to studies involving transgender adolescents and adults; which consistently report elevated rates of anxiety, depression and suicidality (Clements-Nolle et al., 2006; Haas et al., 2014; Terada et al., 2011). These findings highlight a key question about what factors enable these positive mental health findings for gender diverse children and whether it is the act of socially transitioning itself or the acceptance from family members that supports their wellbeing (Durwood et al., 2017). As noted by Durwood et al (2017), these findings may suggest that the experience of gender dysphoria more often observed in adulthood could be indicative of society’s rejection of their transgender identity, including rejection from key family members, in combination with years of repressing or denying their gender identity, as opposed to experiencing gender diversity per se.  Despite the aforementioned positive mental health outcomes reported in these studies for gender diverse children, not all family member responses were reported as positive or affirming. For instance, Pariseau et al (2019) highlighted the negative impact of indifference on transgender youths’ wellbeing. The researchers suggest that indifference may be expressed through caregivers ignoring their child’s gender identity, not seeking out information to understand their child’s gender issues, or not helping their child to have their gender-related needs met. Similar findings have previously been reported in relation to ambiguity around trans individuals’ family membership, family relationships and when or how to express their gender identity; resulting in psychological distress for such individuals (Catalpa & McGuire, 2018). Within the wider research literature, it is suggested that family members may GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  36 have a limited understanding of their trans relation’s experiences, have perceived loyalties to other family members, and may experience external pressures; such as social, cultural and religious beliefs that likewise impact upon their ability to feel and express acceptance (Katz-Wise et al., 2016; von Doussa et al., 2017). In the general population, young peoples’ experiences of acceptance/rejection by their immediate family members (e.g., mother, father, and siblings) have been shown to differentially contribute to youths’ psychological adjustment (Rohner & Lansford, 2017). These findings therefore highlight the importance of understanding transgender individuals’ experiences of acceptance/rejection from all family members, including siblings (Pariseau et al., 2019). Implications and Conclusions Findings suggest that siblings play a key supportive role in the lives of trans individuals and that sibling acceptance is an important factor in enabling the socio-emotional wellbeing of transgender individuals. As a result, it seems necessary for GIS and subsequent therapeutic interventions to encompass all family members when supporting those who identify as gender diverse; in order to make use of the emotional and facilitative support that siblings can provide, particularly within the context of more rejecting familial and wider social contexts. This may be implemented through the use of Family Therapy approaches, for instance, and through providing psychoeducation and support groups for differing family members.  What is more, these studies suggest that gender dysphoria affects all family members in unique and diverse ways and that it is therefore important to promote increased insight and understanding into all family members’ experiences, including siblings (Westwater et al., 2020). Moreover, these findings highlight the significance of familial closeness and acceptance in protecting against psychological distress for transgender individuals and the role of siblings in influencing experiences of distress GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  37 and familial support. In particular, allowing trans individuals to present as their preferred gender identity appears to be associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety and better mental health outcomes and siblings appear to play an important role in facilitating such feelings of validation and acceptance (Olson et al., 2016).  As such, this literature review highlights the need for further investigation into the ways in which the sibling dynamic may contribute both favourably and unfavourably to mental health outcomes for trans individuals. One such area for further investigation may be to explore the impact of sibling rivalry and conflict on transgender wellbeing and the reasonings for this divergence. It is noted that agreement to participate in sibling research tends to assume a certain level of pre-existing sibling acceptance and therefore, findings from these studies may not be representative of the experiences of trans individuals from less tolerant and accepting families (Haxhe et al., 2018). Given the significance of this relationship in providing acceptance and support, it seems important to also understand the impact of rivalrous sibling relationships on trans individuals’ social and emotional wellbeing. In addition, gaining a better understanding of the impact of cisgender siblings’ gender identity on feelings of acceptance towards trans siblings may also be of benefit. For instance, in a study interested in perceived sibling relationships of LGBT youths, 21.4% of participants first came out to a sister, in comparison to 16% who first came out to a brother (Toomey & Richardson, 2009). As concluded by the researchers, more information about the relationships between LGBT individuals and their siblings is needed, in order to better understand the relationship between sibling acceptance and sibling gender identity (Toomey & Richardson, 2009).  Finally, gaining a broader and more inclusive understanding of how individuals from differing economic and ethnic backgrounds make sense of gender GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  38 diversity within the sibling relationship would also be of benefit. In particular, this information could help to inform more sensitive and representative approaches to mental health service development and delivery, therefore creating safer and more accepting environments for everyone.

Changes to various aspects of sibling relationships have previously been studied, however, the impact of gender diversity upon this relationship has received limited attention. This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of sibling relationships when one individual identifies as transgender. Individual interviews were conducted with nine trans individuals and two siblings of trans persons using a semi-structured interview format. Thematic analysis (TA) was used to examine the impact of gender diversity on the sibling relationship. Specifically, the impact of siblings on transgender individuals’ psychological wellbeing was explored, as well as the impact of gender diversity on the sibling relationship more generally. Findings are considered in light of the Gender Minority Stress Model (GMSM; Hendrick & Testa, 2012). The analysis suggests that the experience of gender diversity and self-disclosure enhances the sibling relationship through increased shared understanding and acceptance. Findings also highlight how trans individuals often come out to their siblings first, in order to gauge their responses before coming out to their parents. Implications for clinical practice are discussed. Namely, clinical psychologists can play a pivotal role in understanding the experiences of the transgender community and in enhancing feelings of social connectedness and acceptance through systemic therapeutic approaches. Further research exploring the sibling relationship in later life and for Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) trans individuals is recommended.  Key words: siblings; transgender; gender diversity; wellbeing.    GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  49 Introduction Gender Diversity The construct of gender is based upon socially accepted standards of behaviour (Unger & Crawford, 1993) and is co-created through interpersonal interactions and responses from others (Harding, 2018). Gender identity has been deconstructed and used variably by different groups over time to highlight the many ways that gender is experienced, understood and expressed (Miller & Davidson, 2019). As such, each person’s gender identity is unique, as is the terminology that they use to describe it (Strauss et al., 2017). In spite of this, most Western cultures endorse two gender categories and assume that they emerge naturally from binary sex categories, male and female (Levitt & Ippolito, 2014). This conflation of the natural and social aspects surrounding sex and gender, and the rigid binary discourse surrounding it, can cause difficulties for those who identify outside of this divide (Wiseman & Davidson, 2011). Individuals who identify as transgender are a heterogenous minority group whose gender identity or expression differs sometimes, or always, from societal expectations (Stryker, 2017). Some transgender people hold a binary gender whilst others may have fluid gender identities and may not align themselves with one gender or may change between gender expressions (Dean et al., 2000). Gender transitioning is the process of changing one’s gender presentation in accordance with one’s internal sense of gender identity and is also conceptualised along a continuum (Brown et al., 1996). For the purposes of this paper, the term ‘transgender’ is understood as anyone whose gender identity differs to the sex that they were culturally assigned at birth and embraces many diverse gender expressions and identities (Lev, 2013; Stryker, 2017). Those who challenge gender norms are at risk of experiencing ‘transphobia’; defined as negative attitudes toward GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  50 individuals with non-traditional gender presentations (Bettcher, 2007), which remain commonplace within the UK (Stonewall, 2018).  In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in the number of people who openly identify under the transgender umbrella (Kaltiala-Heino et al., 2018). As such, there is a growing commitment within public health to understand and improve the health and wellbeing of transgender individuals and other gender minorities, who comprise an estimated 0.3–0.5% of the global population (WHO, 2020). Moreover, it is suggested that the prevalence of gender variance is continuing to rise, and it is estimated that the number of people presenting for treatment within gender identity services (GIS) is doubling every 6.5 years (Reed et al., 2009; Harding, 2018). The aetiology of gender diversity remains largely unknown, but it is probable that a number of hormonal, genetic and environmental factors play a role in its development (Heylens et al., 2012). The 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) recently redefined ‘gender identity disorder’ as ‘gender incongruence’, which has subsequently been moved from the ‘mental and behavioural disorders’ chapter into the newly developed ‘conditions related to sexual health’ chapter. These changes reflect broader societal and cognitive shifts in understanding gender diversity and attempts to remove stigma surrounding this label (WHO, 2020). Nevertheless, the predominant focus on psychopathology and dysfunction within transgender research and clinical practice overlooks the challenges faced by the trans community with regards to social exclusion and discrimination (Hill, 2005).  Sibling Relationships Social relationships play a critical role in an individual’s social, emotional and cognitive development and their wellbeing across the life span (Diener & Diener GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  51 McGavran, 2008). In particular, social relationships enable feelings of social acceptance and social connectedness, which are important protective factors in coping with challenging life experiences and reducing mental health difficulties (Arslan 2016; Ungar et al. 2013). Family systems theory considers the family as a complex social system in which all individuals within a family interact and influence one another’s behaviour (Bowen, 1966) and highlights the key role family relationships play in shaping individuals’ wellbeing (Merz et al., 2009). In this way, sibling relationships play a complex role within human development (Bank & Kahn, 1997) and have gained increasing interest within developmental and psychological research in more recent years (Branje et al., 2004). It is estimated that around 80 to 90% of the population grows up with at least one sibling (Cicirelli, 1982), who often provide social, emotional and practical support and can serve as sources of emotional security across differing transitional life points (Campbell et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2006). Since sibling relationships are one of the longest-lasting relationships that an individual may hold, they are unique in their structure and are important to understanding psychological development and behavioural adjustment (Whiteman et al., 2011).  Transitions within the sibling relationship have been investigated when one, or both, siblings have experienced a significant change in identity as a result of disability (Fisman et al., 2000; Stoneman, 2005), physical illness (Lobato & Kao, 2002; O’Brien et al., 2009) or mental health issues (Bowman et al., 2014; Lamb, 2014). In the context of sibling illness, siblings have been found to embody the role of supporter and to provide helpful influences for the unwell sibling (Dunn, 1992; Woodgate et al., 2016). Nevertheless, research also suggests that siblings may experience feelings of resentment and jealousy towards their unwell sibling; due to the perceived differential treatment and attention that their sibling receives GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  52 (Woodgate et al., 2016). It is suggested that sibling relationships may similarly be affected by changes to other aspects of one member’s identity; including gender diversity (Lamb, 2014). Some assertions have been made with regards to the impact of having a transgender sibling (see Norwood, 2013; Gregor et al., 2016), although these statements require substantiating research (Wheeler et al., 2019). In a recent study focused upon young people’s experience of having a gender diverse sibling, it was noted that siblings took on a supportive role that involved developing a greater understanding of transgender issues (Wheeler et al., 2019). However, this research did not include trans individuals’ perspectives on the role of the sibling relationship.  Transgender Wellbeing Dodge et al. (2012) define wellbeing as “the balance point between an individual’s resource pool and the challenges faced” (p. 230). In this way, wellbeing incorporates psychological, physical and social development and is interested in how people change and cope with challenges (Dodge et al., 2012). Dhejne et al. (2016) conducted a meta-synthesis of the literature regarding mental health and transgender identity and found that trans individuals who attend GIS present with a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychopathology in comparison to cisgender populations. Budge et al (2013) similarly found that rates of anxiety and depression for trans participants far surpassed those of the general population. Risk factors for suicidal behaviour in the transgender population include discrimination, verbal and physical abuse, being recognised as transgender, internalised transphobia, poor educational qualifications, unemployment, poverty and an absence of social support (Haas et al., 2014; Nuttbrock et al., 2010; Winter et al., 2016). In a more recent review exploring the impact of social integration upon transgender individuals’ wellbeing, it was noted that participants across the 18 papers reported various physical health problems following gender transition (Stewart et al., 2018). GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  53 These included being at an increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases associated with higher rates of prostitution following homelessness, financial burden and lack of employment (Stewart et al., 2018).  Distress and impairment for those who identify as transgender manifests differently across the lifespan (American Psychological Association (APA), 2015). For instance, in childhood, gender variant distress is most commonly understood as a state of unhappiness surrounding the child’s assigned sex (APA, 2015). In older children and adolescents, desires to transition gender often interfere with ordinary activities, school attendance and the development of peer relationships (APA, 2015). In adulthood, relationship difficulties are similarly common and may impair occupational and more general day-to-day functioning (APA, 2015). As such, transgender individuals may experience psychosocial impairment and pervasive stigma and discrimination across the lifespan, which can occur across the workplace, social environments and family life contexts (Pitts et al., 2009; Stewart et al., 2018). These findings highlight the need for clinical services to adequately assess the mental health needs of transgender individuals and to provide support that aims to increase social support and interpersonal functioning (Witcomb et al., 2018).  Minority Stress The gender minority stress model (GMSM; Hendricks & Testa, 2012; see Figure 1) is an expansion of Minority Stress Theory and provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for studying the additional stressors that trans and gender diverse individuals may experience (Jäggi et al., 2018). As a stigmatized minority group, individuals who identify as transgender are at a greater risk of experiencing ‘minority stress’; associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety and depression (Bockting et al., 2013). This model incorporates both the notion of distal stressors (caused by GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  54 external sources such as rejection from family members) and proximal stressors (referring to internal and subjective thoughts and processes), and considers both how these factors interact, and how they may be influenced by resilience factors; such as feeling part of a community and connectedness with others (Hendricks & Testa, 2012). Individuals who do not conform to societal norms are at a greater risk of becoming targets of discrimination and stigmatization and as such, those who identify as gender diverse are a vulnerable population; due to increased experiences of gender-related rejection (Gerhardstein, 2010). Developing an understanding of minority stressors and the ways minority groups experience and cope with these stressors is important for both advocacy and for furthering the resilience of these groups (Meyer, 2003; 2015). Several studies have examined the relationship between distal stressors (e.g. gender-related discrimination) and mental health difficulties for those who identify under the transgender umbrella. For example, Bockting et al. (2013) found that experiences of prejudice and discrimination were associated with higher rates of psychological distress. In addition, societal factors such as gender discrimination and physical victimisation have been associated with elevated prevalence of suicidal attempts (Clements-Nolle et al., 2006). Moreover, those who identify as transgender may experience psychological distress as a result of being cut off from the protective factor of a community through negative views of the transgender community itself, and through the process of internalised transphobia; in which trans individuals learn to feel negatively about their own identity (Sánchez & Vilain, 2009). GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  55 In addition to highlighting stressors, the minority stress model also emphasises ways in which social support can buffet against stressors and aid to reduce or avoid negative health outcomes (Meyer, 2015). Positive relationships have been demonstrated as a universal resource for wellbeing (Forgeard et al., 2011) and it is noted that experiencing social connection and integration is critical to both an individual’s health status and quality of life (Emlet et al., 2013). For those who identify as gender nonconforming, affirmation of their gender identity in both formal and informal social interactions is therefore important (Testa et al., 2015). Indeed, research exploring transgender youths’ wellbeing has highlighted the significance of social Figure 1 Gender Minority Stress Model (GMSM; Hendrick & Testa, 2012) GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  56 support from family and friends in enabling positive outcomes (Alanko & Lund, 2020; Ehrensaft et al., 2018). Therefore, understanding the social events and conditions that relate to stigma and prejudice associated with minority stress is important in developing discourses and interventions that involve whole family systems, including siblings (Meyer, 2015; Stewart et al., 2018).  Aim of the Study A literature review (Exley, 2021) determined the scope of pre-existing research on sibling relationships within the context of gender diversity and demonstrated that such research is limited and incomplete. Therefore, in order to address gaps within the knowledge base, the aim of the current study was to explore the lived experiences of sibling relationships within the context of gender diversity by including both trans and sibling perspectives. The study was guided by the following research questions: • In what ways do siblings impact upon transgender wellbeing? • In what ways does gender diversity affect the sibling relationship? Method Design In order to address these research questions, a qualitative approach was utilised, informed by social constructionist epistemology. Thematic Analysis (TA) was used to explore meanings and the ways in which participants made sense of their experiences. Implementing a qualitative research design allowed for an in-depth exploration of the lived experiences of sibling relationships within the context of gender diversity.  Epistemology: Social Constructionism TA is a useful methodology when working with social constructs and in helping to understand the process of social constructionism (Fereday & Muir-GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  57 Cochrane, 2006; Joffe, 2012). Social constructionism provides a critical stance towards conventional knowledge and emphasises the historical and cultural context in which knowledge is understood (Burr, 2015). Social constructionists posit that our knowledge of the world is socially constructed through engagement in everyday social interactions and thus highlights the importance of language in constructing shared meanings between individuals (Burr, 2015). As such, social constructionism is an epistemological perspective and is concerned with how reality is constructed and understood through social processes (Andrews, 2012). In this way, identity can be understood as originating within the social realm, as opposed to within the individual (Burr, 2015). Social constructionism therefore brings into question previously held ideas surrounding gender classifications based upon sexual anatomy as naturally occurring constructs and emphasises the cultural practices that build upon these ideas and which generate the concept of gender (Burr, 2015).  Recruitment Purposive, convenience and voluntary sampling techniques were used. Four participants were recruited through a university transgender support group in the South West of England and five participants were recruited via an online international academic research advertisement website (see appendix A). A further two participants volunteered to take part following advertisement of the study within the researcher’s workplace and social network. Interested participants were requested to contact the lead researcher on the provided email address at which point an information sheet detailing the research procedure and consent form (appendix B) were emailed to them. Two versions of the information sheet were available; for siblings, or for trans participants (appendix C, D).  All participants were given the opportunity to ask questions and to take their time to consider the pros and cons of participation before agreeing to participate. GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  58 Participants This research sought to recruit individuals aged 18 and over who either identified as transgender and had at least one sibling, or who were the sibling of someone who identified in this way. Definitions of ‘transgender’ were not provided; in order to allow individuals to opt into this study based upon their own understanding of this term. In addition, siblings could identify as step, half or full. In total, 11 participants took part in this research project. Of these, two participants identified as siblings of trans individuals (one cis female (CF), one cis male (CM)), and nine participants identified under the transgender umbrella. Two participants were also full siblings to each another. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on recruitment and accessing participants, fewer sibling participants were recruited than had originally been anticipated. However, given the richness of data of the two sibling participants who did take part, and the aims of the research study, it was deemed important to include these transcripts within the final analysis. Participant ages ranged from 18 to 47, with a mean age of 27.7 years. Of the nine participants who identified as transgender, four individuals identified as trans female (TF), four individuals identified as trans male (TM), and one individual identified as trans nonbinary (NB). All participants identified as White and were located across three European countries. Of note, gender acronyms have been used in order to aid understanding of the included interview excerpts (see Table 1).  Table 1 Participant Demographics Trans Female (TF) Trans Male (TM) Nonbinary (NB) Cis Female Sibling (CF) Cis Male Sibling (CM) 4 4 1 1 1  GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  59 Data Collection Data was collected through online individual interviews using the video conferencing platform Zoom. The selection of this method was informed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevented face-to-face communication. In total, 11 interviews were conducted. The online interviews lasted approximately one hour and were audio recorded using a Dictaphone. Two semi-structured interview schedules were developed (appendix E and F) following the initial literature review and were used to help guide the interview discussions and keep the focus upon the aforementioned research questions. These differed depending upon whether the participant identified as trans or as a sibling of a trans person. Interview questions were open-ended to allow participants to challenge the researcher’s assumptions, if necessary, and to emphasise the participant’s individual narrative and experiences. Questions were designed to be predominantly descriptive (focusing upon biographical information), structural (focusing upon the meaning used to make sense of the world) and evaluative (focusing upon the participant’s feeling towards someone or something; Willig, 2013).  Thematic Analysis TA is a qualitative method used for identifying and analysing patterns of meaning across a dataset (Braun & Clarke, 2006). In this way, TA allows the researcher to make sense of shared meanings within a dataset and identify commonalities within the phenomenon of study (Daly et al., 1997). TA is a flexible and accessible method of data analysis, which allows the researcher to identify themes across the dataset in relation to specific research questions (Braun & Clarke, 2012). Within TA, a theme refers to a specific pattern of meaning found within the dataset that may be explicitly observable or more implicitly described (Joffe, 2012). GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  60 As in other qualitative methods, TA allows for the development of knowledge of meaning of the phenomenon under study and provides a helpful framework for facilitating models of human thinking, feeling and behaviour (Joffe, 2012).  An external transcription service was used in order to transcribe interview transcripts verbatim. In order to ensure transcription quality, these transcripts were then read through whilst simultaneously listening to the audio data in order to avoid errors and any loss of information. Using Braun and Clarke (2006) as a guide, data was coded within Microsoft Word where code names were clearly identified, and portions of the relevant text were highlighted. Data was analysed using TA and focused upon the ways in which gender diversity impacts upon the sibling relationship and how siblings influence transgender wellbeing. The Braun and Clarke (2006) model was chosen due to its thorough delineation, the researcher’s own familiarity with this approach, and its perceived suitability to the research project.   This research employed an inductive, bottom-up approach to data coding and analysis. That is to say, the identified codes and themes were derived from the content of the data itself and therefore prioritised semantic data content, as opposed to theory-based meaning (Braun & Clarke, 2006). As noted by Braun and Clarke (2012), it is impossible to be purely inductive as the researcher always brings something to the data. Nevertheless, the analysis attempted to prioritise data-based meaning and give voice to participants’ experiences through the inclusion of direct quotations and representative data extracts.  After familiarising myself with the data, the data was systemically analysed through coding for which I focused upon information that was relevant to answering the research questions. Codes help to identify and provide a label for properties of the data that are assumed to be relevant to the research questions (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Codes were therefore used to either provide a summary of a section of the GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  61 data or to provide a conceptual interpretation of the data content. An example of a coded section of an interview transcript is provided in Table 2 below.  Table 2 Example of Transcript Coding Transcript Codes Participant One: I just think that there's definitely like a lack of information and knowledge. And I see so many people ask me questions and a lot of the time, are really inappropriate questions. Interviewer: Mm. Participant One: And I just think that everyone in the entire world needs to know more about it. [laughs] Interviewer: Yeah. And then it kind of puts the onus on you to represent everyone's views on having a trans sibling. Participant One: Yeah, exactly. Interviewer: Right.

Participant One: - then you shouldn't ask me. Use sibling as resource   Questions about surgery Inappropriate/invasive questions   Sibling as resource    Ethics Ethical approval was sought from the University of Exeter’s Psychology Ethics Committee (appendix G). Informed consent was gained from all participants prior to participation. Participants were made aware of their right to withdraw from participation without penalisation. Participants were also offered access to the study results after participation. All but one participant requested that the research findings be shared. Finally, participant confidentiality was considered, and any identifiable information was removed from the resulting interview transcripts. Nonetheless, given that participants were sharing their individual stories, it was important that participants were made aware that direct quotations from their interviews may be included in the final write up and that such information could be identifiable. In order to protect anonymity, participants were allocated a participant number and attempts were made to maintain confidentiality (e.g. removing the names of individual people, organisations and locations from interview transcripts). Beyond these considerations, GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  63 it was hoped that participants may receive positive benefits from participation; such as feeling heard and being able to contribute to novel research.  Analysis Once the datasets were fully coded, themes and subthemes were then generated. Themes refer to features of the data that are relevant to the research questions and that represent a pattern of response or meaning across the dataset (Braun & Clarke, 2006). As noted by Braun and Clarke (2006), this stage of the analysis involved reviewing the coded data to identify similarities between codes that may be suggestive of broader topics or issues relevant to the research questions. Analysis generated two key themes, Understanding and Disclosure, which are presented in Figure 2 and discussed in more detail below.  Figure 2 Thematic Map  Theme One: Understanding The majority of participants discussed the impact of awareness, knowledge and misunderstanding on both the sibling relationship within gender diversity and upon experiences of transgender identity. The theme of understanding was conveyed through the subthemes of ‘knowledge’, ‘familiarity’, ‘family beliefs’ and ‘cultural viewpoints’. GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  64 Subtheme One: Knowledge Several participants spoke about a lack of public awareness and understanding surrounding transgender experiences. Participants spoke of the frustration and exhaustion in explaining transgender issues to others, which was experienced by both trans and sibling participants. One sibling participant noted a sensationalised interest regarding gender reassignment surgery and being forced to answer inappropriate questions from others on behalf of their trans sibling:  I just think that there's definitely like a lack of information and knowledge. And I see so many people ask me questions and a lot of the time, are really inappropriate questions. And I just think that everyone in the entire world needs to know more about it. [laughs] (participant one, CF) One trans participant spoke about the impact of their sibling’s lack of knowledge on their experience of self-disclosure and the broader negative expectations with regards to revealing one’s gender identity:   … I actually had advice from, uh, trans-- Uh, a support group I went to… where they said, \"Don't say you're Trans because most people don't know what that means. Make sure you say ‘transgender’.\" Um, and that is exactly what I did with my sister and she went, \"I don't know what that word means.\"(participant seven, TF) This ignorance resonated with another trans participant who had chosen to not reveal their gender identity to their sibling, due to their perceived lack of awareness surrounding trans identities:  I don't know if she- if she even knows that transgender people exist (participant eight, TM) On the other hand, cisgender sibling participants noted the positive impact of having a trans sibling on enabling different perspectives towards gender ideals and GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  65 expectations. For instance, one sibling noted questioning their own gender identity and the stereotypes associated with this when coming to terms with having a sibling who identifies as trans:  … Over the years I've come to terms with the idea that he's- that he's transgender, I thought, then there must be so many people that go their whole lives without realising it. It made me question [my gender identity], you know, how much do I fit into the stereotypical, you know, masculine sort of image… (participant three, CM)   This questioning of the traditional gender binary was also discussed by another sibling participant, who noted the freedom in thinking that having a trans sibling enabled and exploring gender identities with their cisgender sibling: … so many people don't even consider the alternatives. How people feel constrained by gender as a construct… so suddenly to be presented with a really plausible alternative is quite like, shaking. Um, so I remember at the time, me and my sister were both like, \"Are we trans?\" [laughs] How would you know? Um, and then after a while, we were like, \"Okay, well, if you don't know then you're not.\" (participant one, CF) Subtheme Two: Familiarity In line with the above, a number of participants noted the ways in which prior awareness and exposure to transgender issues aided experiences of disclosure and feelings of sibling acceptance. For example, one sibling noted how previously having met someone who identified as transgender helped them to feel more assured in accepting their trans sibling’s experiences: Well, I definitely hadn't considered anyone in real life who was transgender before. So, the fact that I had met someone at that point, I guess kind of, it GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  66 proves to you, you know, these people exist and it's not something you just hear about. (participant three, CM) This sentiment was echoed by their trans sibling, who similarly participated within this research, and who noted that such prior awareness enabled them to feel more secure in coming out to their cisgender sibling: I know that he had, um, a classmate who was a trans girl… So, I knew that he was aware of what being trans is… he didn't behave negatively towards her. So, I thought, \"Oh, you know, this wouldn't be that different.\" You know, her-- he has a concept of what being trans is like and being close to somebody who's trans is like. So, luckily, that was also, um, a helping factor- (participant four, TM) In addition to the above, one participant spoke about a broader cultural shift in more recent years, in which trans identities appear more visible within mainstream media, and how this increased visibility aided their sibling’s acceptance of their gender identity: … 2015, 2016 was a weird tipping point where it suddenly became, um, like, people knew what [being transgender] was. Um, so, yeah. I-I kinda came out just after that cusp, so I shouldn't have expected [sibling] to know what I meant by ‘trans’, but obviously, now she does. (participant seven, TF) Subtheme Three: Family Beliefs Familial beliefs towards gender constructions were pertinent within participants’ discussions. Some participants described their families as having more progressive and liberal beliefs than they perceived wider society to hold; therefore, enabling the family system as whole to be more accepting towards transgender identities: GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  67 … I mean, everyone in my family's quite onboard with deconstructing gender roles and stuff. So, the idea of wanting to use a ‘they’ pronoun instead of the generic binary…  it's not really coming out in our family. (participant one, CF) Similarly, a number of participants spoke about ideas and approaches towards gender that were received during childhood, particularly during play. Several participants noted the use of gender-neutral toys in deconstructing gender roles and aiding experiences of sibling acceptance:  Gender was never a topic… Even as children… He loved to play with dolls. And it just never was a problem, so-- We haven't incorporated these gender roles that deep. (participant eleven, NB) And … we all played together with exactly the same gender-neutral toys… my sister did have a doll's house when she was younger, but all three of us played with her as well so there was never any sort of obvious gender roles in- in play… (participant seven, TF) Subtheme Four: Cultural Viewpoints Several participants also spoke about the influence of cultural discourses in experiences of sibling acceptance. One trans participant described their parents being raised within a conservative country and their sibling’s fear that they may therefore experience gender-related rejection:  … it wasn't like, um, like the most awful coming out experience, but it's still somewhat negative. Like there was crying, there was shock, there was hesitance to accept the situation… I think, [sibling] sort of-- Maybe he might have known that [parents] would react like that but he didn't want to like GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  68 completely tell me it might be really negative. I think he just wanted to emphasise that-that he'll be there for me if I needed it. (participant four, TM) In helping to facilitate familial gender-related acceptance, one sibling noted the role of GIS in normalising the experience of gender diversity, as well as an awareness that such services are not universally available at this time:  If there were worries, they were definitely put to rest by the fact that we're supporting him, and well, I guess, we're quite lucky living in-in-in a country like England where people like him, that the system- that, you know, that there is a way for them to be supported. There are many ways in fact. Uh, not every country has that. (participant three, CM) Theme Two: Disclosure In line with the above, the notion of gender self-disclosure was paramount to participants’ discussions concerning the sibling relationship and transgender wellbeing. Discussions have been categorised into subthemes of ‘testing the water’, ‘acceptance’, ‘conflict’, and ‘authenticity’.   Subtheme One: Testing the Water Participants readily discussed the experience of gender self-disclosure and a number of participants identified cisgender siblings as the first person in which they came out to. More specifically, the notion of using cis siblings to ‘test out’ how parents might respond to their gender identity was noted by several trans participants. For instance: I don't think I'd ever asked him why he told me first but if I remember correctly at the time, it was because he was just nervous, you know, how are [parents] gonna accept it? How are they going to react? If that's a really negative reaction obviously it will affect him emotionally. So, I'm again, like I'm, you know, a steppingstone or like a-a buffer. (participant three, CM) GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  69 And … actually, my sister was the first person I came out to. I sort of treated her as a bit of a, like, uh, a litmus test. Um, 'cause I knew that she-- she's quite good at figuring out how other people will respond. (participant five, TF) Subtheme Two: Acceptance Feelings of acceptance were frequently discussed by participants. A number of trans participants spoke about the positive impact of knowing that their sibling was supportive of their identity on their sense of safety and wellbeing. For instance: You just don't know what their response is gonna be. So, when it's a good one, when it's a positive one, it's quite a relief. (participant four, TM) Nevertheless, participants also noted the difficulty in adjusting to having a sibling who has transitioned and described a period of processing in order to aid acceptance. One trans participant noted their cis sibling discussing their gender identity with another family member as part of the acceptance process:  … he took it initially very, very well and just asked questions-…/ then he spoke about it with my mum. He was like, \"I don't know if I can deal with this. I don't know what this means.\" And then, after he processed it for a bit went- went back to his initial reaction, which was, “yeah, cool”. (participant seven, TF) The use of pronouns and name changes in the affirmation of gender identity was also discussed. Some trans participants noted incidences of misgendering and “deadnaming” (using their birth name), which negatively impacted upon feelings of validation and acceptance: Um, my older brother sends a couple of packages to my deadname which is a problem and I've sort of mentioned a couple of times around Christmas, like- GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  70 \"Do you remember to check trans people's names are right on Amazon?” (participant five, TF) And … I can't re-remember him s-slipping up that much. I think, mm, him and my whole family kind of used gender-neutral pronouns for a while as a kind of transition period for them. Which wasn't ideal for me because… I go exclusively by male pronouns so; I felt a little bit like I have to com-- I have to compromise… (participant four, TM) On the other hand, trans participants also discussed cisgender siblings’ tendency to be more proactive in using chosen names and pronouns, in comparison to parents and grandparents, for instance: It's like that the insane transition that [trans sibling] has had, like, how much happier they become, you would want that for anyone you care about and it's like using different pronouns, it's all you have to do to make someone that much happier. (participant one, CF) However, one trans participant noted feeling that they would never be fully accepted by their cis sibling, despite the performative use of their chosen pronouns: Well, I think like she accepts me. Um, she's a lot better at like using pronouns and stuff. And at the very start she was a lot better at using my preferred name, um, than my parents were. Um, but I-I just-- Yeah, I don't think she'll ever see me as a brother… Interviewer: Why do you think that? I don't know, I just-- Sometimes I think she says stuff and it like, it hints that like, she still sees me as like her sister. (participant ten, TM) GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  71 Subtheme Three: Conflict In addition, a number of participants noted incidences of conflict within the sibling relationship that impacted upon feelings of gender-related acceptance. Specifically, several participants spoke about differing relationships to their parents and how this could instigate feelings of jealously and sibling rivalry: I would definitely say that my dad and my brother are closer to each other… I haven't felt that with either of my parents… at times when I was, um, like transitioning, especially kind of earlier on mid-transition, around there, I was a little bit jealous, a little bit like, a little bit angry that I didn't get the same kind of treatment…. I do understand, obviously, it's different, um, because I was socialised as female. (participant four, TM) In line with this, one trans participant noted how their cisgender sister felt initially threatened by their trans identity and how this might change the family system and the attention that they received: I am fairly certain that over the years, it's always been me and dad and [sibling] and mum. That's the way it's always been. And then when I suddenly came out and started rebuilding this relationship with mum, I don't think my sister liked that… I think she saw that as a threat. (participant six, TF) Subtheme Four: Authenticity Several trans participants spoke about the role of siblings in affirming their gender identity and the significance of this on improving their wellbeing and self-esteem. In particular, one participant noted how revealing their true self to their sibling enabled a stronger and more authentic way of relating: …  I would say it's a better sort of, a-a better quality of relationship because I can be myself, I know that I'm not hiding anything. (participant two, TF) GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  72 In this way, one cisgender sibling noted how the experience of disclosure and acceptance enabled their trans sibling to reveal their authentic self and how this visibility enhanced the sibling relationship: This sounds-this sounds really mean saying he didn't have a personality before…/ but after [trans sibling] came out, it was like, that's when I started to get to know [trans sibling] and we built a relationship and hung out all the time. So, it wasn't really a surprise because I felt like I didn't know anything about [trans sibling] before. (participant one, CF) However, participants also noted the difficulties of self-disclosure and discussed how the experience of coming out to their sibling was not always as they had anticipated. For instance, one trans participant spoke about needing to hide their authentic self before coming out to their sibling and the detrimental impact of this on the quality of the relationship:  I don't think I've ever had that proper sibling relationship. I-I think a lot of that is because when we were children, I wasn't myself. I was struggling to be somebody else. I think that's a large part of the problem. Um, and that was what I was hoping with transitioning I could rectify that, but ob-obviously that didn't happen. So, I-I don't know what a sibling relationship means. I have no comprehension of-of what that should be. (participant six, TF) As such, participants identified the important role of siblings in witnessing and affirming transgender identities and highlighted the ways in which these experiences could impact upon trans peoples’ psychological wellbeing and sense of themselves.   Discussion This research aimed to develop a greater understanding of how transgender individuals, and their siblings, make sense of this relationship. The researcher was also interested in the ways in which siblings may impact upon transgender wellbeing. GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  73 TA of the interview transcripts demonstrated two overarching themes, Understanding and Disclosure, which contained a number of nuanced subthemes, which will be considered in more detail below.  Participants identified a lack of general knowledge and awareness as to the scope of gender diversity issues, which inadvertently impacted upon the sibling relationship. Participants noted variability in terms of siblings’ familiarity with transgender issues, with a number of participants stating that their sibling had no awareness, or limited understanding, as to what it means to identify as trans. Within the current study, gaining further knowledge and insight appeared to ease siblings’ fears and aid feelings of acceptance; demonstrating the need for services to offer support and information to the family system as a whole, in order to help siblings to better understand gender diversity issues.   Some trans participants discussed experiences of misgendering and the inaccurate use of pronouns from siblings. In line with the GMSM, this experience gave rise to distal stressors in which trans participants’ felt that their gender identity was being invalidated by their sibling. As such, experiences of sibling non-affirmation generated proximal stressors in which some trans participants chose to hide aspects of their gender identity, in order to protect themselves from further non-affirmation and potential gender-related rejection. These distal stressors may therefore represent further targets for intervention; for instance, through the use of more holistic and family-based interventions in which clinicians may facilitate conversations between family members, so that trans individuals can verbalise their needs and experiences and family members can express any concerns they might have (Coolhart & Shipman, 2017).  Nevertheless, the majority of participants within the current study noted the supportive role that siblings play in providing gender identity affirmation; particularly GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  74 within familial contexts in which gender-related acceptance was not guaranteed. Trans participants described the ways in which sibling acts of support enabled feelings of affirmation and connection; through being seen and embraced within the family context. Several participants noted the efforts made by siblings to adjust to name and pronoun changes and the tendency for siblings to be more proactive and accurate in using these, in comparison to parents. These findings may be indicative of younger generations being more open to gender fluidity and nonbinary identities (Marsh, 2016) and the emergence of theoretical frameworks (e.g. intersectional feminism and transgender theory) that challenge existing gender role stereotypes (Davies, 2004; McRobbie, 2009). For instance, intersectional perspectives consider the different forms of discrimination and oppression that exist based upon the intersection of differing social categories and recognise that oppression can occur as a result of changing gender or contesting gender categories (Stryker, 2017). As such, these findings highlight the important role of siblings in enhancing familial gender-related acceptance; through bridging the intergenerational relationship gap between trans individuals and their parents. Moreover, a number of participants described first disclosing their gender identity to their sibling, in order to gain a sense of how others, namely parents, may respond. This finding is reflected within the broader LGBT research literature, in which it is suggested that the reactions of siblings may be used to either verify or modify the manner in which an individual comes out to other family members (Savin-Williams, 1998). As such, if an individual’s self-disclosure is positively received by their sibling, they may feel more comfortable in coming out to their parents (Beaty, 1999). Within the current research, disclosing to siblings prior to a parent seemed to strengthen the quality of the sibling bond and enable feelings of increased authenticity within this relationship; through trans individuals’ having their gender GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  75 identity seen and accepted. Having better understood the challenges that their trans sibling had experienced, cisgender siblings noted feeling more protective of them; leading to greater acts of solidarity; such as publicly defending their sibling’s gender identity.  In addition, through gaining insight into the reality and complexity of transgender experiences, siblings were found to explore their own beliefs surrounding gender and gender stereotypes, and to examine underlying assumptions regarding their own gender identity and the broader gender binary that dominates Western discourses. This humanising of the transgender experience enabled siblings to develop more open and inclusive thinking with regards to constructions of gender and towards those who sit outside of the traditional binary. Through this process of experiential learning, siblings therefore moved beyond the objective and developed greater understanding and empathy towards their trans sibling (Cramer et al., 1997; Rye et al., 2007). As such, siblings play an important role in advocating for gender diverse individuals and in heightening feelings of acceptance, pride and connection within the family environment.  Clinical Implications This research highlights the important role of siblings in supporting transgender wellbeing. The use of siblings as a steppingstone towards parental self-disclosure demonstrates the significance of this relationship in supporting trans individuals’ experiences of gender diversity and providing a familial environment in which trans identities are heard, understood and accepted. As previously noted, siblings are often overlooked by services, yet these findings highlight the supportive role of siblings in enabling positive mental health outcomes for transgender individuals.  As such, the findings of this study advocate for systemic approaches to supporting gender diverse individuals within mental health services and the role of clinical GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  76 psychologists in developing such services accordingly. Working systemically could help to include and integrate all family member perspectives, to reveal potentially unknown family member viewpoints, and to address rejecting or discriminatory assumptions in order to promote familial acceptance (Westwater et al., 2019). Clinicians may therefore help families to expand their beliefs surrounding gender identities and to help to develop more authentic relationships where trans individuals feel seen and accepted for who they are (Coolhart & Shipman, 2017). Nevertheless, in considering the active involvement of siblings within therapeutic settings, it is important to consider with the client the level of closeness with their sibling, their sibling’s attitudes towards LGBTQ+ issues and their cultural family values in order to inform the decision-making process (Szymanski & Hilton, 2021). For sibling dyads in which conflict exists, it may be more helpful for cisgender siblings to access outreach programmes, which support those who hold more conservative attitudes or lack knowledge or contact with trans individuals, for instance (Hilton & Szymanski, 2014).  In addition, participants’ narratives highlighted the need for cisgender siblings to receive information and guidance to help support the wellbeing of their gender diverse sibling, as well as to receive support for their own wellbeing; in order to allow space to process and make sense of their experiences. As noted by Wheeler et al (2019), being able to access communities in which gender diversity is normalised seems important in helping siblings to process changes to their trans sibling’s gender identity, to share their experiences and fears with others and to gain a greater understanding of gender diversity issues. This may be in provided in the context of GIS through training days and support groups, for instance, or through broader LGBTQ+ support groups, networks and local charities.  Finally, as rates of transgender identities continue to increase, and people transition earlier in their lives, it is more important than ever that mental health GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  77 practitioners broaden their own awareness as to the challenges faced by gender variant individuals through engagement in reflective practice and appropriate gender diversity training. Similarly, it is important that clinical psychologists consider their own biases and beliefs surrounding gender and to consider the ways in which these ideas are constructed and reinforced within services and day-to-day interactions and practices. Practices such as supervision, reflective practice and personal therapy may help to promote this thinking. Such efforts are important in promoting more inclusive gender discourses and depathologising and destigmatizing the challenges faced by those who identify as gender diverse.  Researcher Reflexivity As a cisgender, able-bodied, White woman it felt important to generate a space in which participants could provide their own narratives and that these voices could be honoured. As an advocate and ally to the LGBTQ+ community, I felt passionate about conducting a project that promoted the voices of trans individuals and their siblings and was also interested in gaining further insight into this area myself. As someone who has a positive relationship with their own sibling, I was curious about how gender diversity might impact upon this relationship and what factors might influence ease of sibling acceptance. What is more, the notion of social constructionism and gender performances fit with my own philosophical stance. As a feminist and person who has experienced prejudices from others based upon my assumed gender identity, I was interested in further unpicking these gendered practices.  Even so, in completing this research project, the extent to which an individual can identify as cisgender and not display stereotypical beliefs surrounding gender has been considered. As noted by Butler (2021), whilst we as individuals are not entirely determined by cultural norms, we also cannot escape them. As such, attempts have GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  78 been made (e.g. through ongoing supervision and self-determined learning) to avoid unintentionally reinforcing dominant discourses surrounding gender identities and power. As argued by Wilson et al (2002), this research sought to focus upon individuals’ experiences with regards to gender diversity and the sibling relationship, rather than labelling gender identity difficulties as pathological, and therefore aimed to avoid promoting binary concepts of sex and gender.  Strengths, Limitations and Future Research Overall, this research provides a novel contribution to understanding how sibling relationships impact upon transgender wellbeing and how this relationship is affected by gender diversity. Nonetheless, there are several limitations. Due to the unanticipated context of COVID-19, the process of recruitment was negatively affected, resulting in a smaller participant sample than had originally been anticipated and needing to use Zoom to conduct interviews. Whilst there were some technical difficulties experienced with regards to the strength of internet connectivity, this approach was deemed beneficial, however, in allowing flexibility and ease of interaction with participants from across, and outside of, the UK.  This research is also limited by its lack of representation and it is therefore important to keep in mind that drawing generalizable conclusions from this data is not possible. The majority of participants were aged between 20 – 30, which, although not unexpected for this population, did mean that older trans adults’ perspectives were not adequately captured. Given the exponential developments within the field of gender psychology over the past decade (de Graaf & Carmichael, 2019), it is likely that older trans persons’ experiences may differ and therefore require further investigation with regards to their experiences of the sibling relationship. GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  79 Moreover, future research should be conducted that includes Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations and that considers cross-cultural variations in conceptions and experiences of gender diversity within sibling relationships. As noted by de Graaf et al (2019), perceptions of gender and gender identity are conceptualised differently across differing cultures, therefore impacting upon experiences of sibling acceptance and rejection and broader transgender wellbeing. What is more, transgender people of colour may experience additional stressors through multiple forms of discrimination on the basis of their race and gender (Bettcher, 2007) and those of a lower economic income may not be able to finance medical and non-medical changes in appearance (Hale, 2007). These experiences can prevent BAME trans people from accessing healthcare and support, placing them in a vulnerable and isolated position (Choudrey, 2016); therefore, further adding to the complexity of the transgender experience that requires more in-depth exploration than this study can provide. Conclusion This study investigated the impact of gender diversity upon sibling relationships and the ways in which siblings influence transgender wellbeing. This is a novel research area in which there is currently a limited literary base. Findings underscore the significance of siblings to understanding trans individuals’ experiences and highlight the importance of sibling support in enabling accepting and affirming familial environments. Namely, this study highlights the role of siblings in initial trans self-disclosure and the ways in which this experience enhances the strength and authenticity of the sibling relationship. Findings also suggest that siblings require further information and support in understanding trans issues and in adjusting to their trans sibling’s status. It is suggested that services and practitioners supporting trans persons focus on working with the system surrounding the GENDER DIVERSITY AND SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS  80 individual where appropriate; in order to promote such understanding and acceptance of authentic gendered expressions.

    "abstract": "Siblings are often an important source of support and companionship and play a key role in influencing individuals’ social and emotional wellbeing. Changes to various aspects of sibling relationships have previously been studied, however, the impact of gender diversity upon this relationship has received limited attention. This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of sibling relationships when one individual identifies as transgender. Individual interviews were conducted with nine trans individuals and two siblings of trans persons using a semi-structured interview format. Thematic analysis (TA) was used to examine the impact of gender diversity on the sibling relationship. Specifically, the impact of siblings on transgender individuals’ psychological wellbeing was explored, as well as the impact of gender diversity on the sibling relationship more generally. Findings are considered in light of the Gender Minority Stress Model (GMSM; Hendrick & Testa, 2012). The analysis suggests that the experience of gender diversity and self-disclosure enhances the sibling relationship through increased shared understanding and acceptance. Findings also highlight how trans individuals often come out to their siblings first, in order to gauge their responses before coming out to their parents. Implications for clinical practice are discussed. Namely, clinical psychologists can play a pivotal role in understanding the experiences of the transgender community and in enhancing feelings of social connectedness and acceptance through systemic therapeutic approaches. Further research exploring the sibling relationship in later life and for Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) trans individuals is recommended",
