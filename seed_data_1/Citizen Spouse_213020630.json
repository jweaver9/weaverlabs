Marriage is often the primary way in which a person canexercise and demonstrate his or her identity under law, by claiminglegal benefits and by performing legal obligations. This Essayexamines the history of one particularly salient example of marriage-as-citizenship-the derivative domicile rule-and uses this history toconsider how the relationship between marriage and citizenship haschanged and developed over time. The derivative domicile rule linkeda woman's domicile, and her state citizenship along with all therights and obligations it carried, with her husband's domicile byoperation of law. This happened regardless of where she actuallylived or what state she subjectively owed allegiance to. Derivativedomicile remains pertinent today because many states still use it todetermine state citizenship for married people, either as apresumption rebuttable by a married woman or as a rule that appliesto both spouses and links their domicile by presuming they will eachregard one single place as their home. The history and currentapplication of the derivative domicile rule demonstrate that thesepresumptions fail to accurately reflect the preferences of manymarried people whose domiciles do not match their spouses'.

In becoming a part of Naomi's \"people,\" Ruth iseffectively altering her citizenship, casting aside other loyalties to followNaomi wherever she may go. This vision of marriage as citizenship is romanticand aspirational; indeed, the Ruth story is often recited at weddings-gay andstraight-because it so perfectly reflects notions of marital fidelity, eventhough the Ruth and Naomi of the Bible were not technically married.2 Theinsight that marriage can function as a form of citizenship is one of the greatestcultural contributions of the marriage equality movement.The notion of marriage-as-citizenship may sound romantic, but whenenshrined in law, it also has important consequences for civil, political, andsocial rights. Until quite recently, a woman's citizenship was determined by hermarriage, not just metaphorically but also legally. At the state level, a marriedwoman's citizenship followed her husband's under the rule of \"derivativedomicile\"; at the national level, her citizenship could be bestowed or taken1. Ruth 1:16-17.2.

In this Essay, Iexamine the history of the derivative domicile and national citizenship rules toexplore the ways in which marriage can and does function as citizenship, and tooffer a critique of how analogies to citizenship still infuse our understanding ofmarriage today. Understanding marriage as an identity-producing legal statusakin to state or national citizenship, I argue, can lead it to dwarf or trump otheridentity statuses.A. The Meaning of CitizenshipTo understand how marriage can function as a form of citizenship, oneneeds to understand clearly what citizenship is. This is no easy task. Likemarriage, citizenship is a notoriously slippery concept that can invoke differentmeanings in varying contexts. Sociologist Rogers Brubaker famously describedcitizenship as \"both an instrument and an object of closure.\" 3 As an instrumentof closure, it is a \"prerequisite for the enjoyment of certain rights, or forparticipation in certain types of interaction\"; as an object of closure, it is a\"status to which access is restricted.\"A Citizenship, in other words, includesaccess to a bundle of rights and also the status of membership itself, the identityof \"citizen.\"In his seminal essay, Citizenship and Social Class, the sociologist T.H.Marshall subdivided the rights associated with citizenship into civil, political,and social rights.5 Civil rights include the rights to contract, sue, and ownproperty; political rights include the rights to vote, run for office, and serve on a6jury; social rights include rights to education and welfare. But, as Brubakermakes clear, citizenship is more than just access to rights. It is the bundling ofthese rights into a coherent status category that creates a legally cognizableclass of \"citizens.\" As Brubaker puts it, \"There is a conceptually clear, legallyconsequential, and ideologically charged distinction between citizens andforeigners.\"7 It is this distinction that makes citizenship not only an instrumentbut also an object of closure-not everyone can get it, so the status itselfbecomes something to desire. Citizenship thus connotes a sense of belonging, apolitical or patriotic affiliation with a nation or state. It becomes an identitycategory, describing the allegiance a person has to a culture or country, an3. ROGERS BRUBAKER, CITIZENSHIP AND NATIONHOOD IN FRANCE AND GERMANY 23(1992).4. Id. at 31.5. T.H.

Some scholars have further identified civil, political, and social forms of citizenship thatentail not only rights but also obligations, such as military service and jury service.

Derivative CitizenshipMarriage, like citizenship, is a legal status category that can be thought ofas \"both an instrument and object of closure\" as articulated by Brubaker. Likecitizenship, marriage carries with it a bundle of rights and obligations. Accessto these rights has been a central goal of the marriage equality movement-many lawsuits have focused on the \"1,138 federal benefits, rights andprotections\" afforded to married couples.9 And like citizenship, marriage hasbecome a coveted and desirable social and legal status-so much so that theNinth Circuit Court of Appeals recently declared California had \"adversely\"affected the \"status and dignity\" of gay and lesbian couples by stripping themof the right to designate their legally recognized, long-term adult relationshipsas \"marriage.\"10Marriage and citizenship are overlapping status categories that do not mapneatly onto each other. Sometimes one is dependent on the other,\" andsometimes they provide access to similar sets of rights. 12 Although \"citizenshiptalk\" abounds in the legal scholarship on marriage,13 the complex relationshipbetween the two status categories has been largely unexplored.This Essay examines the history of a much-neglected legal doctrine toilluminate the contemporary interaction between marriage and citizenship: therule of derivative domicile. Under this rule and the federal statutes that adoptedthe rule on a national level, a married woman's state and national citizenshipwas determined not by where she was born, where she decided to live, or what8. See BOSNIAK, supra note 6, at 98 (noting that \"the practice of ensuring the 'belonging' and'unity' of the nation's members simultaneously and inevitably signals the existence of a sharp dividebetween insiders and outsiders to the nation\").9.

For an example of citizenship giving access to marriage, consider the rush by recentlyfreed slaves to marry as an incident of full citizenship. See PEGGY COOPER DAVIS, NEGLECTEDSTORIES: THE CONSTITUTION AND FAMILY VALUES 35-37 (1997) (discussing the enthusiasm offormer slaves to marry as a sign of social and legal status). For an example of marriage giving accessto citizenship, consider the faster track to naturalization for the spouses of U.S. citizens than for others.See Immigration and Nationality Act § 316, 8 U.S.C. § 1427 (2006) (setting forth residencyrequirements for naturalization); § 319, 8 U.S.C. § 1430 (setting forth reduced residency requirementsfor spouses of U.S. citizens).12. For example, in contemporary America, the right to health care is understood primarily asa right to insurance access for full-time employees and their spouses, but it could just as easily beunderstood as a right of social citizenship.

See infra Part M.A.410 [Vol. 101:407CITIZEN SPOUSEstate or country she chose to adopt as her own, but instead by the citizenship ofher husband. This meant that a woman could be expatriated if she married aforeigner, a consequence that aroused vociferous complaint from feminists, andultimately led to legal reform.14Less obviously, on the state level, the derivative domicile rule meant thata woman could be deprived of rights given to citizens in a particular state if herhusband chose to change his domicile. Today, this may not seem like aparticularly significant problem. Federal diversity jurisdiction is the context inwhich attorneys most commonly think domicile matters. But in the yearsbetween 1839, when some states began passing Married Women's PropertyActs,'5 and the 1970s, when the Supreme Court began to strike down gender-discriminatory laws under the Equal Protection Clause,'6 the state of a woman'sdomicile mattered enormously. She might have full civil rights in one state-the ability to enter into contracts, to manage her own property and retain herown wages, to sue and be sued, or to be a member of a profession-but not inanother. State citizenship was a threshold status category leading to a particularset of civil and political rights. Derivative domicile meant that marriedwomen's rights were tenuous and unpredictable.Even though the derivative domicile rule has been largely eroded,understanding its history has important consequences for thinking about therelationship between marriage and citizenship today. First, analyzing thederivative domicile rule demonstrates that marriage has been, and continues tobe, a threshold status that grants or denies access to the civil, political, andsocial rights associated with citizenship. Because women's civil and politicalrights varied from state to state, a woman's citizenship rights could flicker onand off depending on where her husband lived. For nineteenth-century women,marriage could function as the \"on/off' switch to civil rights, since statecoverture law could abrogate those rights. Even as coverture unraveled in somestates, however, women's citizenship was still tied to marital status. Thederivative domicile rule enabled husbands to alter the substance of their wives'citizenship rights by changing their domicile from a jurisdiction where theirwives had civil rights to one where they did not. Today, marriage only confersrights, and these rights are largely social citizenship rights rather than civilrights-access to health care, welfare payments, and housing.Second, the derivative domicile rule also reveals the ways in which awoman's marital identity subsumed her other identities. A wife living in aparticular state or nation might have a strong sense of allegiance to it, closefamily ties there, a desire to vote or manage property in it, or may simply want14.

But the derivative domicile rule rendered these factors irrelevantin determining her citizenship-marriage would do the work of determining herlegal and social identity. Or, as one court put it: \"Marriage is for man only anepisode, while for woman it is the epic of her life.\"' 7In short, the derivative domicile rule, archaic though it now seems, was arule that transformed a woman, through marriage, into a citizen wife. Hercitizenship rights were mediated through her status as a wife, and her social andlegal identity was the identity of \"wife\" to the exclusion of anything else.Indeed, being a wife and mother was an accepted and celebrated form ofexercising citizenship. For women, marriage was the ultimate form ofbelonging.Nineteenth-century marriage law seems far away, but it continues toundergird American family law and to influence societal expectations of whomarried couples are and what they should do.'9 Echoes of the derivativedomicile rule sound in the marriage-as-citizenship arguments raised in themarriage equality context today. But the rule has transformed as well. Nolonger does marriage determine whether a wife will have civil or politicalrights, but it still determines who will have social citizenship rights. No longerdoes the derivative domicile rule function to turn married women's rights onand off, but the patchwork of state responses to same-sex marriage means asame-sex spouse may find her rights flickering on and off depending on whereshe is domiciled.20 No longer does marriage turn women into citizen wives,their identities subsumed to their husbands', while leaving men autonomous,independent selves; marriage is now capable of turning any single person into a\"citizen spouse.\" The idea of the citizen spouse may be gender-neutral, but it ishardly marriage-neutral. In many cases, it is marriage and not citizenship thatprovides public benefits, a social identity, and a sense of legitimacy andbelonging.This Essay explores the history of the derivative domicile rule and links itto marriage's place in the current legal and social landscape.

Part II traces thedemise and transformation of the derivative domicile rule, showing the legaland social transformation of the citizen and his citizen wife to citizen spouses.Part III considers the importance of this history for our understanding ofmarriage today.I.THE DERIVATIVE DOMICILE RULEDomicile is a form of state citizenship. Sometimes the term \"domicile\" isused as a synonym for state citizenship. Other times it is used descriptively, toshow the requirements for achieving state citizenship. As with nationalcitizenship, a person has a \"domicile of origin\" from birth in a particular stateand may obtain a \"domicile of choice\" by moving to a new state or jurisdictionand intending to remain there.21 Thus, a person's domicile \"is the place of 'histrue, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which hehas the intention of returning whenever he is absent therefrom.\"' 22As a citizenship status, \"domicile\" is declining in use today; many statesinstead use \"residence\" or \"inhabitance\" to distribute state citizenship-basedrights such as voting, welfare, or tuition benefits.23 But at common law,domicile was a more robust and far-reaching concept. Just as nationalcitizenship could be acquired by birth on American soil, birth to Americanparents, or through naturalization, the acquisition of domicile-by birth, bychoice, or by operation of law-gave a person state citizenship. Under thederivative domicile rule as expressed at common law, a wife took on herhusband's domicile by operation of law, even if her husband was domiciled in aplace where she had never been.24 Similar laws affected women's national21.

L.REv. 561, 561 (1953) (discussing how state statutes tend to use the word \"residence\" to determinecitizenship rather than \"domicil\").24. Obviously, in many cases a husband and wife were both domiciled in the same state beforeand after marriage. But in an era of westward expansion and extensive internal migration, Americansfrequently made temporary migrations without a fixed desire to permanently settle. Thus it was quitecommon for a wife to find herself in a Western state or territory with a husband who was domiciledelsewhere, or, conversely, waiting in her state of birth for her husband to return from a westwardadventure only to discover later that he had settled, established a new domicile, and, sometimes,divorced her and remarried without her consent. See, e.g., Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 209 (1888)(upholding Washington Territory's power to grant husband a legislative divorce without notice to hiswife, whom he had left behind in Ohio); see also Ann Laquer Estin, Family Law Federalism: Divorceand the Constitution, 16 WM. & MARY BILL RTS.

Other affiliations, including a sense ofaffiliation with a nation, were effectively trumped by marriage. 26For married women, then, marriage was a legal status of such strength thatit could override others, including national citizenship and state citizenship.27State citizenship could be crucial to accessing civil and political rights, and therights of married women were especially variable. Prior to the NineteenthAmendment's passage, women had the statutory right to vote in some states butnot others,2 and married women's civil rights-including the right to contract,sue and be sued, and own and manage their own property and wages-varieddramatically from state to state. Other rights determined by state citizenshipincluded where or whether a woman could file for divorce, 30 where her willwas probated (and thus what terms her will could include under thejurisdiction's substantive law),3 where and under what rules her property wasexception to the derivative domicile rule made it more likely that two states would be in directcompetition for jurisdiction over divorce cases).25.

Her status as a wife mattered first and foremost;citizenship came second, and she exercised it in a particular way, as a wife. AsJustice Bradley famously explained in his concurring opinion in Bradwell v.Illinois, denying women the right to a profession did not damage their rights ascitizens, for citizenship protected only the \"privileges and immunities of thesex,\" which included \"the noble and benign offices of wife and mother.\"38The derivative domicile rule had its roots in coverture, the law thatapplied to married women at common law. In its strongest form, coverturemeant that a married woman \"perform[ed] everything\" under the \"wing,protection, and cover\" of her husband, and therefore, she was referred to as afeme covert, or covered woman, and her condition during marriage was called\"coverture.\"39 The legal effects of coverture on married women were extensive:wives could not enter into contracts without their husbands' consent, enter a32.

See, e.g., Shute v. Sargent, 36 A. 282, 283 (N.H. 1893) (noting that derivative domicilerule was \"subversive of the statutory voting right and being elected to office\"). Prior to the NineteenthAmendment, which gave women the right to vote nationally, the derivative domicile rule could evenmean that a woman would be prevented from voting at all. Imagine, for example, that a jurisdictiongave women the right to vote but observed the derivative domicile rule; she might have nowhere tovote if the state of her husband's domicile did not give women the right to vote.37.

As one court put it, \"thewhole theory of the marital relation involves the idea of a single home,established by the husband and cared for by the wife, where the two shall dwelltogether.\"41 Indeed, the rule was intimately connected to the other incidents ofcoverture, including the duty of the husband to support the wife and her duty torender services to him. One 1888 treatise explained it this way: \"The husband isthe head of the family. He decides where the family residence shall be, and maychange it as often as his pleasure, business or health dictates; and his wife mustlive where he directs.\"42 WiVeS were \"bound to follow\" their husbands if achange of domicile occurred.43The notion of a husband's absolute control over the family was soentrenched that Congress expanded the derivative domicile rule to covernational citizenship as well.

For example, if thederivative domicile rule were taken at face value, it would mean husbands butnot wives would have access to divorce. A woman who had been abandoned byher husband would lack a forum in which to seek a divorce. Her husband couldobtain a new domicile, thereby changing her domicile through operation of law,46. CoNG.

As a result, many jurisdictions developedexceptions to the derivative domicile rule for wives seeking divorces becausetheir husbands had abandoned them.52The abandonment exception to the derivative domicile rule, however, didnot upend coverture's hold on the effects of marriage on a woman's citizenshiprights. It only shifted the end of the marriage forward in time. In 1858, forexample, the U.S. Supreme Court justified the exception by arguing that thewife's marriage was functionally over by the time she filed for divorce.5 3 Ahusband who abandoned his wife failed to do his duties under coverture byridding himself \"of all those conjugal obligations which the marriage relationimposes upon him, neither giving to her the necessaries nor the comfortssuitable to their condition and his fortune, and relinquish[ing] altogether hismarital control and protection.\"54 In other words, the marital status no longerexisted; the husband had shirked his status obligations, so the wife couldabandon hers as well-he had \"yield[ed] up that power and authority over herwhich alone ma[d]e his domicil hers.\"\" An exception for divorce cases wherethe husband was at fault did not, however, disrupt the logic of the rule itself.56The derivative domicile rule shows how marriage can function as a formof citizenship in both of the ways I have identified. First, it highlights the extentto which marriage can be the on/off valve for exercising citizenship rights.Before the passage of the Married Women's Property Acts, simply marryingwas enough to alter a woman's citizenship status, at least as far as her civilrights were concerned. But as coverture unraveled at various speeds across thestates, the derivative domicile rule-and state citizenship more broadly-tookon more importance. A woman might live in a state where she possessed thefreedom to contract, vote, and practice a profession, but if her husband were to51. See Note, The Domicile ofa Wife, 26 HARV. L.

At common law, most of coverture's rulesforced a woman to take on the identity of her husband at the expense of otheridentities. Married women were legally discouraged from crafting a businessidentity (since they lacked capacity to contract or to sue or be sued, and often,were barred from certain professions)57 or a property-owning identity (sinceprior to legislative reform, their husbands controlled and managed their realproperty and outright owned their personal property),58 or even a parentingidentity to the extent that their plans were at odds with their husbands' (since ahusband would be granted custody in a divorce).One may imagine that the wave of Married Women's Property Acts andwage acts passed in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, the ratification of theNineteenth Amendment, and an increasingly mobile society might togetherhave conspired to do away with the derivative domicile rule. But the rule turnedout to be surprisingly persistent, for reasons to which I now turn.II.FROM CITIZEN WIFE TO CITIZEN SPOUSEThe derivative domicile rule should have been fairly easy to get rid of. Allcourts needed to do was to interpret the statutory law abolishing coverture tomean that married women were independent agents, to be treated just likemarried men. In the case of domicile, this would mean that a married woman'sdomicile would turn on her intent. This would not necessarily mean marriagewas completely irrelevant to the analysis; in a case where a person had equalties to two places, it might be sensible to consider their commitment to a spousedomiciled in a particular place as evidence of intent to remain there. And inmany if not most cases, a woman would be married to someone who shared thesame domiciliary intent since most people cannot afford to maintain multiplehomes.The contexts in which domicile commonly arises are furthermore specificto the individual. For instance, domicile involves cases in which an individualmust pay taxes, can file a lawsuit, or can vote. Even those cases that involve the57. See Aziz Z.

Under principles of in rem jurisdiction, solong as at least one spouse is domiciled in a state, the court has jurisdiction overthe status of the marriage. Yet outside the context of divorce, courts werestubbornly persistent in enforcing the derivative domicile rule. Even afterwomen obtained political rights, and Married Women's Property Acts gavewomen limited control over some aspects of their financial lives, they remainedlegally \"covered\" by their husbands in many other respects.6 1A. The Persistence ofDerivative Domicile for WivesIn the first half of the twentieth century, some courts began to deviatefrom the derivative domicile rule, but the cases are remarkable for their effortsto distinguish the facts at bar from \"usual\" marriages. In perhaps the mostfamous case justifying a deviation from the traditional rule, Virginia v.Rutherfoord, the Virginia Supreme Court created an exception to the derivativedomicile rule where the wife was the clear breadwinner.62 Helen Rutherfoord, awealthy widow domiciled in New York who had remarried a Virginian,challenged Virginia's attempt to tax securities she owned. The VirginiaSupreme Court sided with her, holding that even when a wife and husbandwere living together happily with no intention of separation, a wife couldmaintain a domicile separate from her husband.64 The Rutherfoords appeared tospend their time, usually together, at three different residences in New York,Washington, D.C., and Virginia.65 Mrs. Rutherfoord voted and paid incometaxes in New York, and Mr. Rutherfoord in Virginia.6In holding that Mrs. Rutherfoord could choose to maintain her domicile inNew York, the Virginia Supreme Court explicitly linked the rights granted inMarried Women's Property Acts to a woman's right to determine her owndomicile. In Mrs. Rutherfoord's case, fixing her domicile in Virginia ratherthan New York would have substantial tax consequences, since Virginia60. Divorce jurisdiction is generally understood as a form of in rem jurisdiction: the res is themarriage, and the marriage travels with either party, so having one party domiciled in a state gives thestate jurisdiction over the divorce.

In In re Simpson's Will, the court emphatically stated that \"[i]t is thelaw of this state that the domicile of the wife follows that of her husband,\" 72 butthen proceeded to fix the matrimonial domicile in New Jersey, where the wife,Mrs. Simpson, had lived before marriage and continued to maintain at least oneresidence.7 3  The court conceded Mrs. Simpson \"was the dominantpersonality.\"74 Mr. Simpson \"had no visible means of support; no separateincome, and no employment during all of his married life. She was theprovider, she paid the bills, and it was but natural that he should adopt herhome, her domicile, as his own.\"75 Even still, the court did not find that adependent spouse's domicile followed that of the breadwinner. Instead, it foundthat Mr. Simpson had voluntarily adopted his wife's domicile upon marriage,thereby changing his domicile from New York to New Jersey.

No matter the facts on the ground, thehusband's role in the marriage was that of The Decider, even if deciding meantdeferring to his wife.Married Women's Property Acts and the Nineteenth Amendment wereapparently not enough to dissuade courts from the idea that husbands werebreadwinners who controlled their wives' locale and therefore their citizenship.But by the 1970s, many states were scrapping their allegiance to the rule bycreating either codified or judicially mandated exceptions to it. A handful hadabrogated it altogether.78 But even in the 1970s, a truly gender-neutral domicilerule remained elusive. The rule's tenacity appears to have resulted not onlyfrom regressive ideas about gender roles in marriage but-more importantly forthe purposes of this paper-from romantic notions about the nature of marriageitself and its importance to personal identity.For example, the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws, published in1971, retained the derivative domicile rule but made it rebuttable by the wife. Amarried woman was presumed to have the same domicile as her husband\"unless the special circumstances of the wife make such a resultunreasonable.\"79 This rule was dictated, according to the Restatement writers,by what it termed \"natural feelings\": \"the wife will usually regard the76.

Second, the shift from law tofeelings is one of the first indications in the derivative domicile jurisprudenceof a shift in the understanding of marriage from a hierarchical, gender-basedrelationship to a companionate one. Under the 1971 Restatement, a marriedwoman did not need to share her husband's citizenship; a married womanwould want to.The Restatement's assertion of \"natural feelings\" was exactly the kind oflanguage that offended women's rights leaders of the 1970s. Indeed, abolishingthe derivative domicile rule was on women's rights activists' agendas. Thepioneering feminist legal scholar Hernia Hill Kay drew attention to the problemin her casebooks on conflict of laws and sex discrimination.82 In a leadingguide to the likely impact of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) on state laws,several attorneys from the Women's Law Project explained that the ruleharmed women's access to equal citizenship by potentially denying themeligibility for resident tuition at state schools, jury duty, voter registration,eligibility to run for office, venue in law suits, reduced tax liability, andjurisdiction over estates. The ERA's ratification, they explained, could resultin one of two options. Either married women would be treated like married menor unmarried people-as individuals-or married men and married womenwould both be subject to the rule. 84 This latter option they dismissed asimpracticable: \"[T]he extension to men of the conclusive presumption that nowapplies to married women would produce an insoluble conflict in the case of adisagreement over domicile between two spouses.\"85 As we shall see, thisproblem has not stopped some states from attempting to retain the rule whilemaking it gender neutral.8 680.

That case was Mas v. Perry, a favorite of civil procedurecasebooks. Judy and Jean Paul Mas, a married couple, sued Oliver Perry, theirpeeping-tom landlord, for installing a two-way mirror in the bedroom theyshared as graduate students at Louisiana State University.89 After the Masesobtained verdicts of $15,000 (for Judy) and $5,000 (for Jean Paul), Perrychallenged the court's jurisdiction to hear the case.90 He argued Jean Paul was aFrench citizen, and therefore diverse from Oliver Perry, a Louisiana citizen, forpurposes of a federal diversity action.9' Judy Mas, however, was not diverse,despite the fact that she had lived in Mississippi all her life before attendingschool in Louisiana and thus under normal domicile rules would still have beendomiciled in Mississippi. 92 In fact, Perry argued, Judy Mas could not access thefederal courts in a diversity case at all.Perry argued the derivative domicile rule dictated that Judy was adomiciliary of France because Jean Paul was a French citizen. But Judy wassimultaneously a citizen of the United States. To have her case heard in federalcourt, she needed to either be a U.S. citizen, diverse from the defendant, or analien. 94 The Fifth Circuit sided with Judy and Jean Paul Mas, but declined tocompletely overturn the derivative domicile rule, missing a crucial opportunityto put the nail in its coffin. The result in Judy Mas's case, the court explained,was \"curious\" and \"absurd,\"95 but only because her husband was an alien-ifher domicile followed his, then she, a U.S. citizen, could never access a federalforum at all. Therefore, the court concluded, \"for diversity purposes a womandoes not have her domicile or State citizenship changed solely by reason of hermarriage to an alien.\"9687.

Some states persisted,pursuant to the Restatement, in presuming a wife's domicile followed that ofher husband-a presumption that might be difficult to rebut in practice.98Unlike other sex-discriminatory laws, derivative domicile has never beendefinitively struck down.99 In fact, there is some evidence that the derivativedomicile rule frequently still functions in a gendered way, even today. 00Indeed, although many states have moved toward ostensibly gender-neutral domicile rules, commentators have struggled to articulate how a gender-neutral rule should work in practice. The Restatement of Conflict of Laws, forexample, was amended in 1988 to make the rule gender neutral. Now the titleof the relevant section reads: \"The rules for the acquisition of a domicil of97.

This may be because the posture of derivative domicile cases made the rule difficult tochallenge. In order to bring a constitutional challenge, a plaintiff must come forward with a claim thatcannot be otherwise disposed of; most courts will avoid the constitutional question if they can. Eventhough many states retain the gender discriminatory language of the derivative domicile rule, theygenerally allow a wife to come forward with evidence of her separate domicile to rebut thepresumption. Most women who challenge a finding of derivative domicile under a rebuttablepresumption rule would win their claims, thus obviating the need for a constitutional challenge.100. See Judge John D.

Uncertainty remains.\" 0 5B. Toward a Gender-Neutral RuleAlthough some states have retained a softened version of a genderedderivative domicile rule, the equal protection revolution of the 1970s largelytransformed the legal landscape in which the rule could operate. That genderedlaws now attracted heightened constitutional scrutiny meant courts andlegislatures had to choose: either they could repudiate the idea that maritalstatus trumped other allegiances, or they could retain the principle but make itgender-neutral. Although lawyers such as those involved in the Women's LawProject observed that a gender neutral rule would create \"insoluble conflict,\"' 06that is precisely the rule some states have adopted. At first glance this approachmay seem absurd or impracticable, but it actually falls in line nicely with theSupreme Court's 1970s family law jurisprudence. A close look at these casesshows that the trend during this period was not only to abolish gender as apermissible means of legal discrimination, but also to bolster marriage as asource of social citizenship rights.In those cases, the usual result was that the Court brought the contestedlaw into compliance with the Equal Protection Clause not by limiting itscoverage but by expanding it to spouses of either sex.

Instead, it extended the possibility of alimony to bothhusbands and wives. 08 This extension had what I term a \"marriage-intensifyingeffect\"-it made marriage a status that potentially trumped other identities. InOrr, broadening alimony's reach is a marriage-intensifying move in that payingalimony prevents a \"clean break\" from a marriage and perpetuates a potentiallypermanent obligation to one's ex-spouse. 0 9Similarly, several other gender discrimination cases decided by the Courtin the 1970s were not only about gender but also about how marriage acts as agateway to important social citizenship benefits. Weinberger v. Weisenfeld, forexample, struck down a section of the Social Security law that granted\"Mother's insurance benefits\" to widows but had no comparable \"Father'sinsurance benefits\" available to widowers.\"i0 Frontiero v. Richardson struckdown a statute that gave spousal medical benefits and larger housing benefits tomarried male but not married female servicemembers. \"'What went unnoticed in both cases was the significance of marriage as aprerequisite for obtaining these benefits; they buttressed the notion that marriedparents are more worthy of receiving Social Security survivor's benefits thanunmarried parents, and that married service members deserve larger housingallowances and spousal medical benefits because of the long-term commitmentof marriage. Where equal protection law could have dismantled the architectureof marriage-based benefits, it was instead used to expand them. Marriage wentfrom a gendered status that defined women's legal identities to a gender-neutralstatus that defines married people's identities, simultaneously marking them asmore worthy of state support than the unmarried and limiting their ability to actin ways that contradict the state's notion of what married people must do.112107.

Feminists may have had good reasons to litigate these cases as gender-discriminationcases without trying to dismantle marriage itself. The reality for many women was that marriage wastheir profession; to take away marriage-based Social Security, tax, or health insurance benefits wouldbe tantamount to taking away a major source of support. For a helpful summary of the goals of thefeminist movements of the 1970s and 1980s, see Herma Hill Kay, From the Second Sex to the Joint2013] 427CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWIf the transformation of derivative domicile is framed as a transformationfrom a gendered practice to a marriage-intensifying one, it falls in line moreneatly with the constitutional gender discrimination cases of the 1970s. Somecourts, rather than doing away with the derivative domicile rule altogether,have indeed attempted to turn it into a gender-neutral rule that makes marriagethe most important factor in determining a person's state citizenship. As theWomen's Law Project lawyers anticipated, this process has been messy.\" 3Some states have explicitly taken up the challenge to neuter derivativedomicile, resulting in a rule under which the status of marriage not only trumpsother allegiances for married women but for their spouses as well. Take, forexample, Louisiana's articulation: \"A man and wife are presumed to have thesame domicile. This presumption flows in favor of both.\"'\"4 The rule isreciprocal under this articulation, yet still ties married people more closely toeach other than to others, regardless of their particular agreement. The languageof the Louisiana rule is fraught with contradiction-it describes a man andwife, not husband and wife, suggesting, perhaps reflexively and unconsciously,the husband's primacy in the relationship. And the presumption \"flows infavor\" of both parties, assuming apparently that derivative domicile will behelpful and not harmful. Would it have helped Mrs. Rutherfoord's bottom lineif the Virginia Supreme Court, rather than recognizing her domicile of choice,had determined that the derivative domicile rule \"flowed in her favor\"? Insteadof imagining a wife's political and social ties as mapping onto her husband'sregardless of her whereabouts, the Louisiana rule imagines the couple asinwardly focused, each spouse's domicile reinforcing the other's. 5California's rules for determining in-state tuition eligibility recently madethe national news, once again putting a gender-neutral twist on derivativedomicile into the spotlight.

The case was achallenge to a mayoral candidate's claim to domicile within the city of Knoxville. Although his wifeand children continued to live in Knox county, it seemed clear from the circumstances that Mr.Hofferbert had rented an apartment in Knoxville solely to establish himself as a resident so he couldrun for office. The fact that he still owned a house in the county and that his family continued to livethere seemed to be fairly good evidence of his subjective, personal intent not to remain in Knoxville.Thus, the court applied the derivative domicile rule and concluded that \"it is difficult for the Court tounderstand ... how Mr. Hofferbert could establish a legal residence within the city limits of Knoxvillewhile his wife continues to live in Knox County, or outside the city limits of Knoxville.\" Id. at 1002.116.

Bizarrely, a rule intended to prevent out-of-state students fromfraudulently obtaining in-state tuition actually functions to allow students tofraudulently marry to obtain in-state tuition. In fact, there is a matchmakingservice specifically oriented toward helping students to get around financial aidrequirements by arranging what it calls \"marriage[s] of convenience.\"' 18 Thestate's assumption that marriage fundamentally alters a person's otheridentities, including her dependence on her parents, functionscounterproductively.The reluctance of courts and legislatures in some states to completelymove away from the notion that marital status trumps a person's statecitizenship may be a reflection of the idea that marriage, like domicile, is astatus that fundamentally alters a person's identity and cannot be contractedaround. Marriage itself determines a couple's citizenship rights, regardless ofwhat each spouse's personal goals and desires may be.

On the surface, that marriage istransformative of a person's identity seems less troubling. Same-sex couplesmay seem to have less to worry about than did wives under coverture; after all,in the same-sex couple's case there is no hierarchical, gendered stereotype thatthe couple might revert to despite its best intentions.120 And there is no longerany risk that one person's civil and political rights will be shut off by marriage,or that his or her legal and social identity will be subsumed by the other's.

The first aspect, citizenshipas an instrument of social closure, is readily apparent in the arguments made formarriage equality that hinge on access to social citizenship rights available onlythrough marriage. In the second aspect, citizenship is the object of socialclosure. This aspect manifests itself in the claim that regardless of whetherpublic benefits are conferred through different means, such as civil unions ordomestic partnerships, \"withholding the word marriage impermissibly connotesa kind of second-class citizenship.\"l22 Sometimes, as in President Obama'srecent endorsement of same-sex marriage, both aspects are combined.'121.

Theyappear to resonate with activists, judges, politicians, and the public alike. Butwhy is the argument so compelling? Taking a step back, it seems clear that thecurrent relationship between marriage and citizenship was not inevitable,whether one imagines citizenship as access to rights or citizenship asbelonging. The United States could, for example, have a system that distributesmost social citizenship rights irrespective of marriage (this is, to be overlysimplistic, what many northern and western European countries have done).124Likewise, the United States could have a system in which marriage isconsidered a private social matter that may or may not signal a person'sbelonging in the community. Such a system might make sense, given thesubstantial number of people who are currently unmarried in America today-nearly half of all adultsl 25 -and the frequency with which Americans bothmarry and divorce.126But neither of those is the system we have in the United States today.Instead, we have placed marriage on a pedestal, both socially and legally, usingit to dispense important social welfare benefits and to signal maturity andbelonging to the community. In other words, we treat marriage as a form ofcitizenship in both of Brubaker's senses of the word. Like citizenship, marriageis an object of social closure, a status that demarcates insiders from outsiders.Historically, marriage functioned in England as a status that distinguished adultmembers of the community; indeed, marriage as a marker of adulthood existsroberts-abc-news-interview-president-obama/story?id=16316043&singlePage-true#.T9idD7XhcnU(stating that \"[w]hen I hear from them the pain they feel that somehow they are still considered-lessthan full citizens when it comes to-their legal rights-then-for me, I think it-it just has tipped thescales in that direction\").124.

The most obvious criticism of themarriage-as-citizenship paradigm is a familiar one: perhaps marriage simplyshould not be the repository for important social citizenship rights, no matterhow egalitarian it is. Adding the relatively small percentage of the populationwho are in same-sex relationships to those eligible for marriage does not solvethe problem that nearly half the adult population cannot currently benefit frommarriage-based benefits at all.'3 5 Concern for the large group of \"outsiders\"who will remain even if marriage equality is universally successful has ledmany scholars to question whether advocates should expend so much energy onachieving it.136As Professor Laura Rosenbury has shown, for example, our currentsystem of privileging marriage above all else pushes people into marriage forlack of other alternatives and effectively effaces the kinship and friendshipnetworks many unmarried individuals rely on for social and economic support,preventing them from creating the kind of legal stability the married canenjoy.' 37 It is enormously frustrating to be denied the health insurance a spousewould be entitled to, based on something as arbitrary as the sex of one'spartner.

[but marriage]has proven persistently incapable of effectively serving that public, economic function.\").4332013]CALIFORNIA LAWREVIEWKim has shown, we can advocate for a \"skeptical marriage equality\" thatsimultaneously recognizes the importance of equality while questioning whymarriage should be the basis for social citizenship rights at all.139B. Marriage-as-IdentityAlthough the close linkage of rights to marriage should be a cause ofconcern, it does represent quite a reversal compared with how marriageaffected the citizenship rights of women under coverture. When coverture wasthe law of the land, marriage functioned to deprive women of their civil rights.And even once coverture began to unravel, marriage could deprive women ofrights; a woman subject to the derivative domicile rule could be unilaterallyexpatriated from her state of citizenship by her husband, and thereby deprivedof that state's civil rights protections. In this Part I will explore some ways inwhich marriage continues to trump other identities.1. Derivative Domicile, ReduxIt is in the context of citizenship's identity aspects-Brubaker's \"object ofclosure\"-that the link between derivative domicile and our current notions ofmarriage-as-citizenship is most analogous. As in the case of wives under theold derivative domicile rule, a strong form of marriage-as-citizenship makesmarriage a person's primary identity-producing status. Women under coverturecould have no other durable legal statuses than \"wife,\" because these statuseswould compete with their husbands' for their allegiance. Similarly, much ofcontemporary marriage law works hard to make marriage a person's primaryidentity status. Contemporary versions of the derivative domicile rule are, onceagain, a good example. Recall that some states-Louisiana and Massachusettsmost prominently-solved the equal protection problem of derivative domicileby making their rules gender neutral. As it turns out, the consequence of thismove for same-sex couples is that marriage can trump other affiliations-another example of a marriage-intensifying rule.Consider, for example, a recent case arising out of Massachusetts.Francesca Cerutti-O'Brien, a resident of Massachusetts for over ten years, wasdenied the right to divorce on the theory that her marriage to another woman,Donna-Marie Cerutti-O'Brien, and their residence and subsequent purchase ofproperty in Florida, made her a domiciliary of Florida.140 The two women hadbeen seeing each other for years, with Francesca living in Massachusetts andDonna-Marie in Florida. 141 Each winter-when Massachusetts is cold butFlorida is quite comfortable-Francesca had made trips to Florida, ranging139.

That she kept hervoter registration and vehicle license registration did her no good; the courtmerely concluded that because the marriage fell apart so quickly, in less thanseven months, she \"never got around to\" changing them.'5 8 To keep herdomicile, the court held, she needed to \"establish[] a declaration of choice ofdomicil prior to the marriage.\"'S9Normally, domicile is durable. There is a presumption that a person'sdomicile remains the same unless evidence clearly shows intent to change it.i1oIn Francesca's case, absent the court's imposition of the derivative domicilerule, she almost certainly would have won.61 But in this case, her marriageoverrode all other facts. Gender is no longer the operative factor; now the testreflects a notion that there must be a marital residence, \"that married coupleslive together.\" 62 In so holding, the court adopted the 1971 Restatement'scompanionate theory of marriage. Husbands and wives-indeed, wives andwives-are now equals, but as equals they must subordinate their otheraffiliations to the marriage.The ability to file for a divorce may not seem to matter much.

Of course, unlike our nineteenth-centurycitizen wives, Francesca can get her divorce after one year. But there remains aproblem with privileging her marital identity over her link to Massachusetts,because it denies her agency and autonomy.The court's reasoning could easily have severe repercussions on differentfacts. Imagine Spouse A, who claims to be domiciled in Massachusetts, is ahigh-income earner. In the one year she has to wait to become a resident perMassachusetts statute, she could earn a significant amount of money that wouldbe marital property, divisible at divorce, despite the fact that the marriage hadbecome factually dead sooner. Or perhaps Spouse B has a gambling problem.Spouse A may face major liability when she is finally divorced. 1s Or imaginethey have children: the couple used Spouse A's egg and donor sperm toimpregnate Spouse B. How can Spouse A obtain a custody order in a state likeFlorida that might not recognize her as a parent?' 6 If she leaves the state andtakes her child with her, she will be subject to criminal kidnapping laws.' 67 Ifshe leaves the child behind while reestablishing her Massachusetts domicile,she will be in a poor position to make a custody claim after living apart fromthe child for an entire year.'6 8 Allowing the status of marriage to trump the164.

CONST. art. 1, § 27 (2008) (\"Inasmuch as marriage is the legal union of only one manand one woman as husband and wife, no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantialequivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized.\").165. For more extensive discussion of the problems same-sex couples face when they cannotobtain a divorce in their home jurisdiction, see Joslin, supra note 60.166. Florida law on this issue is currently in flux. Florida does not recognize same-sexmarriage, see FLA. STAT. § 741.212 (2012), so in this hypothetical, it would not recognize Spouse A asa parent of a child based on a marital presumption of maternity. Case law suggests that Florida wouldalso not recognize a functional parenting relationship by a nonbirth mother. See, e.g., Music v.Rachford, 654 So. 2d 1234 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1995) (denying a custody and visitation claim broughtby the former lesbian partner of the parent of a child). While this article was going to press, however,the Florida Supreme Court held oral arguments in a case in which the biological mother (egg donor) ofa child gestated by her former partner brought a constitutional claim challenging a trial court's refusalto give her parental rights. See T.M.H. v. D.M.T., 79 So. 3d 787 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2011) (strikingdown Florida statute as an unconstitutional burden of family rights); Oral Argument Schedule &Briefs, FLORIDA SUPREME COURT, http://www.floridasupremecourt.orgpubinfosummaries/oal0-12.shtml (last visited Jan. 4, 2013) (noting that oral argument in the case was scheduled for Oct. 2,2012).167. See Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738A (2006).168. Massachusetts, like most states, uses a \"best interest of the child\" standard in adjudicatingchild custody in child custody cases. See, e.g., Adams v. Adams, 945 N.E.2d 844, 872 (2011)(applying a standard of \"child's best interests\"). A Massachusetts court making a best-interestsdetermination will likely consider whether the child has a \"strong emotional bond\" with the parent; aparent who has left the child behind voluntarily might have a harder time convincing the court that astrong emotional bond exists. See Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 495-96 (2012) (finding that childhad \"developed a strong emotional bond\" with nonbiological mother \"from... birth until she wasalmost fifteen months old\" before biological mother unilaterally cut child's contact with nonbiologicalmother, and reasoning that these facts supported upholding award of custody to nonbiological mother).4372013]CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWstatus of state citizenship can have dire consequences, especially incircumstances like these where the family rights involved are contingent onstate-law recognition of the underlying marriage.Many people think of their marital relationship as their primary, identity-constructing relationships, but many-perhaps like Francesca-do not. Somepeople are happily married but live apart. In 2006, the Census Bureau reportedthat 3.6 million married Americans, not including separated couples, wereliving apart from their spouses.169 They do this for many reasons: they work indifferent places, they are from different states or communities and retain tiesand loyalties to those places, or the state continues to tie benefits and burdens,including welfare, tax, and voting rights, to the place of a person's domicile.For many of these couples, tying domicile to the residence of one spouse, asopposed to the place where each party separately resides or has resided andintends to remain, makes little sense.There are numerous other ways people signal the degree to which theywant their marriages to subsume other identities and affiliations. Some marriedpeople retain their previous surnames; some married people maintain separatefinances. Some may feel that their nationality, their religious or ethnic identity,their work, or their parental relationships shape their core personal identitiesmore than their marriage does.170 There ought to be room for legal recognitionof adult intimate relationships that does not by necessity trump all otherallegiances and affinities. In other words, a person should be able to be both acitizen and a spouse, without having each status define and limit the other. Bysetting marriage on a pedestal as the ideal intimate relationship, American lawand society may be missing an opportunity to think critically about what thecontours of legally recognized relationships should be and how they relate toother expressions of identity.2. Beyond Derivative DomicileThe Cerutti-O'Brien case, of course, is but one isolated example of howmarriage-as-citizenship can operate as a marriage-intensifying agent in itsmodem, gender-neutral mode. But I think this trend may be more widespreadthan it initially appears.Retaining the custom of name changing upon marriage, for example,means that marriage alters a spouse's legal name, creating a new professionaland social identity. Perhaps not surprisingly, this change is still commonly169. Jennifer Conlin, Living Apart for the Paycheck, N.Y. TIMEs, Jan. 4, 2009, at STI.170.

Similarly, the extent to which family, tax,and pension law not only presume but promote female dependency byfinancially incentivizing single-breadwinner families could also be described asmarriage-intensifying legal norms.1Even legal trends that appear to provide alternatives to marriage mayactually operate as marriage-intensifying. Here is just one example: there is anascent trend in U.S. law, more developed in other countries, towardassimilation of cohabitation into marriage. We normally think of people aschoosing to marry: they go to the county clerk's office, apply for a marriagelicense, and have a legally recognized officiant perform a marriage ceremonyduring the period in which the license is valid. At common law, peoplesometimes married by agreeing to marry, holding themselves out as husbandand wife, and cohabiting-what was referred to as \"common law marriage.\"Common law marriage is largely gone today, but in its place a new doctrine isdeveloping of legal recognition of cohabiting couples. Unlike common lawmarriage, this form of \"marriage\" does not require intent to marry. In fact, thevery opposite is true.Washington State's \"meretricious relationship\" doctrine defines ameretricious relationship as \"a stable, marital-like relationship where bothparties cohabit with knowledge that a lawful marriage between them does notexist.\"172 The result of such a relationship in Washington State is that, shouldthe couple break up, any property acquired during the relationship will besubject to equitable jurisdiction, just as if the couple were divorcing. 7 3 Thecourts have made it clear that a meretricious relationship is not a marriage; afterall, \"[t]he parties to such a relationship have chosen not to get married andtherefore the property owned by each party prior to the relationship should notbe before the court for distribution at the end of the relationship.\"' 7 4 But given171. Individuals who choose to take on a spouse's surname upon marriage are signalingsomething important to the public about their identity and affiliations-a signal that may varydramatically depending on who is sending it. A heterosexual woman taking her husband's name, forexample, may be sending a different signal than a lesbian woman taking her wife's name. Both areindicating that their marital status has significantly changed their personal identity, but in the latter casethe decision to change names may also be a political statement demanding recognition of a familyform that may not be recognized by law.

Connell did not address the issue of alimony, but it is likely that a court wouldrefuse to grant alimony to a cohabiting couple for the same reasons it denied a split of theprerelationship property, to distinguish the relationship from a marriage. Indeed, there are no reportedcases in Washington State where a litigant made a claim for alimony or maintenance using themeretricious relationship doctrine. Courts have rebuffed other attempts to expand the doctrine beyondproperty distribution. See Foster v. Thilges, 812 P.2d 523, 527 (Wash. Ct. App. 1991) (quoting Davis2013] 439CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEWthat the majority of states do not provide for equitable division of premaritalproperty'75  and alimony awards are relatively rare,'76  the Washingtonmeretricious relationship doctrine essentially gives unmarried partners the samerights in Washington that spouses would have at divorce in California-anequitable distribution of whatever they earned during the relationship.Initially, this doctrine arose in a more limited context, where ameretricious relationship developed into a legal marriage. In Marriage ofLindsey, a wife claimed an interest in property acquired during the two-yearperiod in which she and her future husband had lived together beforemarriage.' 7 7 The Supreme Court of Washington agreed that the propertyacquired during the meretricious relationship should have been included in theequitable division of property on divorce.'7 8 The court then expanded thisholding in Connell, where the couple never married at all.\" Some other stateshave begun to adopt similar equitable approaches to extending divorce-liketreatment to unmarried cohabitants who break up.s In other countries-notably New Zealand, Australia, and Canada-unmarried cohabitants areentitled and subject to the same law of marital property and spousal support asmarried couples if they have lived together for a set period of time.' 8 'v.

Onepotentially positive development is the availability of marriage-likerelationships without marriage. Where same-sex marriage is unavailable,sometimes the recognition of cohabitation can provide security that the couplewas otherwise denied. In Vasquez v. Hawthorne, for example, the WashingtonState Supreme Court held in yet another en banc decision that a same-sexcouple could have entered into a meretricious relationship such that one couldinherit from the other.' 82But there is also a difficulty with these cases. Like marriage itself, visitinglegal obligations on long-term cohabitants imposes on them the idea that theirrelationship should have a certain meaning. For heterosexual couples, thismeaning has often been imposed to protect women. Marriage is the institutionthat traditionally dealt with female dependency, but the law sometimes finds away to manage this problem even where no marriage has occurred. But in thecase of same-sex couples, in states where marriage is available, it is less clearwho the \"victim\" of a long-term cohabitation is. Is it the person who stayedhome to care for the children? Does the law now presume that same-sexcouples experience the same social pressures as heterosexual couples, and thattherefore the lesser wage-earner needs the same protection that has commonlybeen given to wives and cohabiting heterosexual women? Now that marriage isincreasingly available to same-sex couples, would those couples realisticallywant their cohabiting relationships to be legally construed \"like a marriage,\"even when they have intentionally eschewed marriage?l 84Recently, there have been reports that some same-sex couples arediscovering that their newly-acquired marital status can be retroactive. Somecourts are apparently giving credit to spouses in same-sex marriages for thetime during which they were together but not married, A la Lindsey. If a couplewas together for twenty-five years but only had the right to marry a few yearsbefore divorcing, some courts will take the relationship's entire duration intoaccount when dividing assets.185 These couples are discovering not only the182.

For some, this legal treatment may be a welcome relief.They were, after all, married in spirit, so why not have their unions recognizedafter the fact? But for others, this treatment may be most unwelcome.Individuals who affirmatively rejected marriage may find themselves caught inits web. By recognizing a nonmarital relationship as a marriage, the statereifies the status aspects of marriage over its more contract-like features,strengthening its role as a form of citizenship and further demarcating the havesfrom the have-nots.Marriage is increasingly becoming the only option; jurisdictions that usedto have civil union statutes frequently convert these relationships to marriagesonce marriage becomes available to same-sex couples. 1It's all or nothing; acouple can choose marriage and all the burdens and benefits it entails, or nolegal recognition at all. And in jurisdictions like Washington State thatimpose recognition on cohabitants, it's not just all or nothing--cohabitationinexorably leads to \"all,\" even for couples who want less.CONCLUSIONThis Essay began with an epigraph from the Book of Ruth. In that storyfrom the Hebrew Bible, Ruth, a Moabite, daughter-in-law of Naomi, anIsraelite, follows Naomi to Bethlehem after Ruth's husband, Naomi's son, iskilled.189 In deciding to follow Naomi, Ruth famously states: \"Where you go Iwill go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and yourGod my God. Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried.\" 90Essentially, she is taking on Naomi's citizenship and her domicile, extendingthe obligations she owed her husband during his life to his mother after hisdeath.186. This criticism could, of course, be applied to the recognition of heterosexual cohabitationas well. Many people, straight or gay, may choose not to many even when they have the optionbecause they specifically want to opt out of its protections and burdens. See William N. Eskridge Jr.,Family Law Pluralism: The Guided-Choice Regime of Menus, Default Rules, and Override Rules, 100GEO.

Ruth 1:16-17.442 [Vol. 101:407CITIZEN SPOUSEThe story of Ruth has been interpreted in three ways that each beardirectly on the notion of marriage as citizenship. 9 ' First, \"Jews-by-choice\"embrace the story. Ruth's status as a convert, first through marriage but then bychoosing to follow her mother-in-law, makes her the ideal example of a personwho changed her affinity (\"naturalized,\" if you will).192 Second, the story is apopular reading at heterosexual Christian wedding ceremonies \"because it soperfectly captures the essence of the love that should exist between spouses.\"' 93And third, gays and lesbians have appropriated the second interpretation,claiming the story of Ruth and Naomi as a story of proto-same-sex marriage, inwhich Ruth's vow to Naomi is equivalent to a wedding vow.1 94What I have tried to suggest here is that these interpretations necessarilygo hand-in-hand. The story of Ruth and Naomi is powerful for gays andlesbians because it conveys how all-encompassing love can be. But it is alsodeeply disturbing. Ruth and Naomi are not on an equal playing field. Ruth issacrificing her life to be of use to Naomi-she even indentures herself to thefarmer Boaz to glean grain to support herself and Naomi, and bears a child tohim, of whom the villagers say \"a son has been born to Naomi.\" 95 The story ofRuth may be the story of marriage, but it is also the story of coverture, the storyof one partner giving up herself, including her citizenship, for the other. 96The observation that marriage can trump other forms of belonging is notnecessarily an argument against marriage. There are many reasons the statemight have an interest in retaining marriage. It seems to make people happierand healthier (although correlation is not necessarily causation).'9 7 It provides aset of default rules for relationships in which the parties may have difficulty191. For several contemporary interpretations of Ruth, many of which track the ones I discusshere, see READING RUTH: CONTEMPORARY WOMEN RECLAIM A SACRED STORY, supra note 2.192. See THE HARPERCOLLINS STUDY BIBLE, supra note 2, at383.193. REV. JEFF MINER & JOHN TYLER CONNOLEY, THE CHILDREN ARE FREE: REEXAMININGTHE BIBLICAL EVIDENCE ON SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS 31 (2002).194. See, e.g., id (interpreting the Ruth and Naomi story as follows: \"Ruth gave up everythingso she could be with Naomi; she put her own life at risk, so she could spend it caring for Naomi ....These actions and emotions are difficult, almost impossible, to explain as mere friendship\"); see alsoJuuA KRISTEVA, STRANGERS To OURSELVES 71 (Leon S. Roudiez trans., 1991) (reading Ruth'sspeech to Naomi as demonstrating \"a loyalty-that one might call passionate-between the twowomen\").195. Ruth 4:17.196. It is also a variation of what historian Linda Kerber has termed \"Republicanmotherhood\"; Ruth exercises her newfound citizenship by bearing a child, a child that will be theancestor of David, and, for the Christian tradition, Jesus. See KERBER, supra note 18 (introducing theidea of Republican motherhood as a way of understanding women's citizenship in early U.S. history).For an analysis of the unsettling nature of David's connection to Ruth, see BONNIE HONIG,DEMOCRACY AND THE FOREIGNER 48-67 (2001).197.

It can be a rigid status, into which the lion's share of public welfarebenefits is bundled, and that is experienced as a person's primary affiliation-what I've called here a vision of marriage-as-citizenship. Or, it can be onealternative among many, none of which is the repository for most sources ofstate and federal largesse.The history of the derivative domicile rule serves as a cautionary tale ofwhat can happen when rights are determined by marriage and not by otheraffiliations, especially in times of rapid legal change. For the women of thenineteenth century, civil rights could be turned on or off through marriagedepending on their domiciliary state's laws. For same-sex couples today, thesituation is similar but even more complicated. Civil rights, such as the right tocontract or manage property, are guaranteed to all, but social citizenship rightsare increasingly linked to marriage. Yet the right to marry is contingent on statelaw, so a change in residence can alter the citizenship rights bundled intomarriage, turning them on or off when a border is crossed. The fight for theright to marry may have the unintended effect of obscuring marriage'sunsavory aspects, including its ability to trump other identities, not onlysocially but legally. We may be moving toward a world where to be a fullcitizen, a person must be a \"citizen spouse.\"198. See Carol Sanger, A Case for Civil Marriage, 27 CARDoZo L. REV. 1311, 1314-15(2006).199.

    "abstract": "Marriage and citizenship have a complicated relationship to one another. Marriage is often the primary way in which a person can exercise and demonstrate his or her identity under law, by claiming legal benefits and by performing legal obligations. This Essay examines the history of one particularly salient example of marriage-as-citizenship — the derivative domicile rule — and uses this history to consider how the relationship between marriage and citizenship has changed and developed over time. The derivative domicile rule linked a woman’s domicile, and her state citizenship along with all the rights and obligations it carried, with her husband’s domicile by operation of law. This happened regardless of where she actually lived or what state she subjectively owed allegiance to. Derivative domicile remains pertinent today because many states still use it to determine state citizenship for married people, either as a presumption rebuttable by a married woman or as a rule that applies to both spouses and links their domicile by presuming they will each regard one single place as their home. The history and current application of the derivative domicile rule demonstrate that these presumptions fail to accurately reflect the preferences of many married people whose domiciles do not match their spouses’. This Essay argues that derivative domicile illustrates the dangers of uncritically eliding marriage and citizenship",
