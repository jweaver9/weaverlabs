Many companies have \nrecognized the importance of addressing the issue of diversity and are moving \nforward to establish and develop successful diversity initiatives. A primary cata-\nlyst causing workplace diversity is the demographic shift of the U.S. population \nand, therefore, of the U.S. workforce. \nDemographic studies show that the composition of the population in the U.S. is \nmore diverse than it has ever been, and it continues to diversify.  According to \nthe Census Bureau, the nonwhite population, which comprised less than one-\nthird of the U.S. population at the turn of the century, is expected to increase to \nnearly half of the U.S. population by the year 2050.  As the number of persons \nwith disabilities grows, so too does the number of persons of color living with a \ndisability. According to the 2000 census, 16.8 million people with disabilities are \nalso minorities. Minority persons with disabilities are disproportionately repre-\nsented among the unemployed, and the employment outlook for them is bleak.\nGiven these changes in the population and in the labor market, there is an in-\ncreased reliance on non-traditional workers and the opportunity for organiza-\ntions and individuals to capitalize on the array of ideas, creativity, and potential \nDiversity and the ADA\n2 \t Diversity\tand\tthe\tADA\ncontributions inherent in a diverse workforce. \nAttracting, recruiting, developing, and retain-\ning a qualified workforce from diverse popu-\nlations is, and will continue to be, critical for \nbusiness survival and organizational success.\nWhat Is the Americans with Disabilities \nAct?\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \npassed in 1990, is legislation that is intended \nto “establish a clear and comprehensive prohi-\nbition of discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability” and to ensure access and participation \nin society for persons with disabilities.  The \nstatute is specifically directed at employment, \npublic accommodations, public services (i.e., \nservices delivered by state and local govern-\nments), transportation, and telecommunica-\ntions.  Title I of the ADA prohibits employers \nwith 15 or more employees from discriminat-\ning against qualified persons with disabilities \nin all terms, conditions, and privileges of em-\nployment, including recruitment, pre-employ-\nment screening, hiring, benefits, promotions, \nlayoff, and termination.  The ADA also applies \nto labor organizations, employment agencies, \nand joint-management committees.\nThe ADA requires employers to provide rea-\nsonable accommodations to qualified per-\nsons with disabilities that will enable them to \nperform the essential functions of jobs held or \ndesired.  An employer may not deny an em-\nployment opportunity to a qualified applicant \nor employee with a disability because of a \nrequest or need for a reasonable accommoda-\ntion.  An employer does not have to provide \nan accommodation if it can demonstrate that it \nwould impose an undue hardship on its busi-\nness.  \nAddressing Diversity and the ADA\nThe term diversity can encompass several di-\nmensions, such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, \nreligion, sexual orientation, and disability.  Di-\nversity, disability, and human resource profes-\nsionals need to be aware of these dimensions \nwhen helping their companies recruit and \nretain employees, sell in the marketplace, and \ndefine diversity within their organizations. \nPersons with disabilities, including minority \npersons with disabilities, have the ability to \nmake positive contributions in the workplace \nand to the success of organizations.\nToday, diversity initiatives are less “affirma-\ntive action”-oriented in that they now reflect \nboth valuing diversity and managing diversity. \nValuing diversity involves recognizing and \nappreciating the differences of individuals.  \nManaging diversity emphasizes developing \ncompany policies, goals, and a culture that \noptimizes the productivity of all employees, \nby understanding their unique needs, motiva-\ntions, and contributions. Also, model initia-\ntives have revealed that diversity initiatives \nrequire the visible support of and commitment \nfrom senior management.\n \nSuccessful diversity initiatives can include \nan array of programs.  Generally included \nis some form of training, as well as efforts \nto change the communication norms of the \norganization.  Specifically, employee surveys, \nemployee networks, diversity management \ntraining, mentoring programs, and the use of \ncompany intranets are frequently put in place \nto assess and broaden the attitudes of employ-\nees and management.  Many corporations also \nexamine their reward systems to ensure that \nemployees are not being evaluated on their \npersonal style, but rather on the merits of their \nwork.  As a part of the initiative, flexibility is \nsometimes incorporated into the work sched-\nule.\n\t W W W . H R T I P S . O R G \t 3\nEmployers are also making strides in assuring \ncompliance with ADA employment provisions \nin their work environments.  This may mean \ntraining staff on the following topics relating \nto ADA implementation: \n• Employment pre-screening and applicant \ninterviewing under the ADA\n• The interplay of the ADA with other state \nand federal employment and non-discrim-\nination laws\n• Writing job descriptions that clearly iden-\ntify essential job functions\n• The reasonable accommodation process \n• Career equity/promotional considerations \nfor persons with disabilities\n• Non-discriminatory performance apprais-\nals \n• Employee relations with employees with \ndisabilities (minority and non-minority)\n• Customer relations with customers with \ndisabilities \n• Negotiation/conflict management in the \nreasonable accommodation process\nIn summary, the implications for employers of \naddressing and understanding diversity and \ndisability as related considerations include:\n• Enhanced recruitment and retention ef-\nforts \n• Improved productivity\n• Expanded training programs that include \nboth diversity (ethnicity, gender, and reli-\ngion) and disabilities \n• Expanded policies and programs\n• Improved morale  \nWhat Is Reasonable Accommodation?\nReasonable accommodation is any modifica-\ntion of or adjustment to a job, an employment \npractice, or the work environment that makes \nit possible for a qualified individual with a dis-\nability to apply for and perform the essential \nfunctions of a job.\nReasonable accommodation includes, but is \nnot limited to, modification or adjustment of \nthe application process to enable individu-\nals with disabilities to apply for work, mak-\ning facilities readily accessible to and usable \nby persons with disabilities, modifying work \nschedules, reallocation of non-essential job \nfunctions, acquisition or modification of \nequipment or devices, and reassignment to a \nvacant position.  An employer is not required \nto reallocate essential job functions or to create \n“light-duty” positions.\n  \nAn employer is not required to provide a rea-\nsonable accommodation if it can demonstrate \nthat it would be an undue hardship to do so.  \nWhether a reasonable accommodation creates \nan undue hardship is a factual issue depend-\ning on factors such as the nature and net cost \nof the accommodation and the size and nature \nof the business.  The duty of reasonable ac-\ncommodation is situation-specific.  \nWhat Is The Reasonable \nAccommodation Process?\nTo identify a reasonable accommodation \nunder the ADA, the employer and employee \nmay wish to engage in a flexible interactive \ndiscussion.  Generally, if an individual with a \ndisability wants a reasonable accommodation, \nhe or she must request one.  If the employer \nhas already not done so, it should then deter-\nmine the essential functions of the affected job \nand consult with the applicant or employee to \ndetermine the job-related limitations imposed \nby his or her disability.  The parties should \nevaluate possible accommodations and select \none that allows the employee to overcome \nthe identified job limitations.  While the em-\nployee's preference is given consideration, the \nemployer has the discretion to choose between \nequally effective reasonable accommodations. \n4 \t Diversity\tand\tthe\tADA\nIt is important that the concepts of non-dis-\ncrimination and equal access for all persons \nwith disabilities be part of an ongoing discus-\nsion in the workplace. Making an accommoda-\ntion that meets an individual's specific needs \nis less difficult when organizations foster a \nclimate that supports ADA compliance.  For \nexample, when a person has difficulty per-\nforming a nonessential job function and the \nemployer accommodates that employee by \nreallocating the task, such a reallocation is \nusually easier when employees are prepared \nthrough prior training and ongoing group \ndialogue on accommodation issues. \nThe ADA contains strict confidentiality re-\nquirements pertaining to medical information \nobtained during a medical examination or \ninquiry.  Medical information must be collect-\ned and maintained on separate forms and in \nseparate medical files and be kept confidential. \nThere are certain narrow circumstances when \nsuch information may be disclosed, including \ninforming supervisors and managers about \nnecessary work restrictions or accommoda-\ntions.\nWhat are some suggested strategies for \nheightening awareness of workplace \ndiversity considerations, multicultural \npersons with disabilities, and the ADA?\nSuccessful implementation of both diversity \nand ADA initiatives require efforts to change \ncorporate culture and attitudes.  Both suggest \nthe need for staff training on non-discrimina-\ntion practices, diversity awareness, diversity \nskills, flexibility in work schedules, and inves-\ntigation of employee evaluation and reward \nstructures.  The parallel nature of these strate-\ngies suggests that the combination of disability \nand diversity initiatives is possible and would \nlikely be advantageous to the success of both \nefforts. \nSelected strategies that may both further di-\nversity initiatives and implementation of the \nADA include:\n• Diversity initiatives that include active \nrecruitment and retention of individuals \nof all backgrounds with disabilities in the \nworkplace through collaborative agree-\nments with state Vocational Rehabilitation \nagencies or local job placement services for \nindividuals with disabilities.\n• Development of targeted job programs for \nminorities with disabilities\n• Development of a mentoring program for \npeople with disabilities\n• Making training, development, and pro-\nmotional opportunities available to all \nminorities seeking job advancement.  For \nindividuals of all backgrounds with dis-\nabilities, this may include supplying \nneeded supports to enable them to access \ntraining, considering new positions, or \nacquiring needed retraining when a dis-\nability occurs that prevents a return to the \noriginal job position. \n• Integration of the nondiscrimination \nrequirements of the ADA and Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act for persons with dis-\nabilities in all facets of staff training and \nhuman resources practices. \n• Making an organizational commitment to \ndiversity by designating an organizational \nofficial to serve as a disability and diver-\nsity specialist.\nThese are only a few of many proactive ini-\ntiatives that employers can take to recruit \nand retain individuals with disabilities in the \nworkplace, thereby expanding their potential \nlabor pool and maximizing human resources \nto enhance workplace outcomes.\n\t W W W .
