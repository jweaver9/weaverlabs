Hodges, the Supreme Court held that same-sex marriage bans violate the Equal Protection Clause for two primary reasons. First, they subordinate; they send the message that lesbians and gays are inferior to heterosexuals. Second, they unequally deny lesbian and gay individuals the liberty to make fundamental decisions about identity and self. These two conjoined themes—anti-group subordination and pro-individual liberty—comprise the two pillars of “equal dignity” that anchor Obergefell’s holding. This Article proposes that these pillars also support the Court’s anti-stereotyping jurisprudence, and equal dignity is thus one important aspect of what the Equal Protection Clause protects. To illustrate: in sex discrimination cases, courts reject state stereotyping when it perpetuates ideas about men’s and women’s roles and reinforces women’s inferior social status; in transgender and sexual orientation discrimination cases, courts have begun to protect LGBTQ individuals from state demands for conformity to normative stereotypes about how to be a man or woman. Protecting individuals’ equal dignity can sometimes become complicated when the reasons for addressing a group’s purported needs elide individual concerns and attachments. For example, the government sometimes relies on normative and statistical information about groups to combat group-associated health and poverty risks, to remedy individual disparate treatment, and to prevent wholesale group exclusion from opportunities and civic duties. Addressing these group-based needs, however, may effectively perpetuate stereotypes about what group membership means. Individual group members may object to the identitarian implications of the government’s help. Not all stereotyping both subordinates a group and denies individuals the liberty to be and express who they are. Accordingly, stereotyping is not wrong in and of itself; how the government uses stereotypes should determine whether state action violates the Equal Protection Clause. Counterintuitively, stereotyping can sometimes promote rather than deny equal dignity. While any state reliance on stereotypes risks essentializing identity, an absolute stereotyping prohibition exacerbates certain forms of race, sex, and sexual orientation blindness. Groups are important, and the government requires some flexibility to address group-based needs.                                                       * Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco School of Law.

Hodges1 struck down all remaining same-sex marriage bans in the United States.2 Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, reasoning that same-sex marriage bans deny “equal dignity” to same-sex couples3 and, by extension, to gays and lesbians as a group.4 The Court ultimately held that same-sex marriage bans violate individuals’ fundamental right to marry as protected under the term “liberty” in the Due Process Clause,5                                                      1. 576 U.S. __, 135 S.

One longstanding tenet of Equal Protection law is that the government cannot rely on or perpetuate stereotypes when distinguishing between and among certain groups.8 In the landmark Reed v. Reed9 decision of 1971, the Supreme Court gave life to the anti-stereotyping principle when it struck down as unconstitutional an Idaho statute that explicitly preferred men over women as estate administrators.10 In Reed, the ACLU argued in a brief co-authored by now-Justice Ginsburg that “legislative judgments have frequently been based on inaccurate stereotypes of the capacities and sensibilities of women,”11 and a diverse array of laws perpetuate the overarching sex-role stereotype that a woman’s place is “subordinate to man.”12 The Court validated these arguments throughout the following years and decades, holding repeatedly that sex classifications that “ratify and perpetuate invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes about the relative abilities of men and women”13 violate the Equal Protection Clause. The anti-stereotyping principle extends beyond sex and applies in other contexts in which the government classifies on the basis of a suspect status or protected trait. In holding that sexual orientation is a suspect classification warranting heightened judicial scrutiny, the Ninth Circuit in SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories14 recently                                                      6. Id. at 2604–05.  7. See, e.g., id. at 2603 (“Rights implicit in liberty and rights secured by equal protection may rest on different precepts and are not always co-extensive, yet in some instances each may be instructive as to the meaning and reach of the other.”).  8. Professor Cary Franklin argues the anti-stereotyping principle in Equal Protection law as originally developed “dictated that the state could not act in ways that reflected or reinforced traditional conceptions of men’s and women’s roles.” Cary Franklin, The Anti-Stereotyping Principle in Constitutional Sex Discrimination Law, 85 N.Y.U.

The Ninth Circuit explained that preemptive strikes based on “preconceived notions of the identities, preferences, and biases of gays and lesbians reinforce and perpetuate”15 stereotypes, and to revoke a civic responsibility based on these stereotypes “demean[s] the dignity of the individual.”16 What do the anti-stereotyping and equal dignity principles have in common? This Article proposes that equal dignity is one theory of Equal Protection that can explain when governmental stereotyping is unconstitutional.17 The Court’s anti-stereotyping jurisprudence attempts to tackle the dual constitutional harms of group subordination and individual liberty denial, and Justice Kennedy made both harms central to equal dignity’s meaning in Obergefell. First, Kennedy reasoned that, when buttressed by the “long history of disapproval” surrounding same-sex relationships, bans on same-sex marriage impose a “disability on gays and lesbians” that “serves to disrespect and subordinate them.”18 Second, Kennedy explained that equal dignity also requires space for individuals, “within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity.”19 In other antidiscrimination law contexts, cases that rely on the anti-stereotyping principle to strike down classifications based on sex, race, and sexual orientation likewise reflect anti-group subordination and pro-individual liberty themes. Obergefell simply unifies these themes by tying both to a dignitary conception of equality. Protecting stigmatized groups from subordination while simultaneously providing ample room for individual group members to “define and express their identity”20 can sometimes create tension. Friction arises when (1) the government acts to address a problem that, based on a statistical correlation between some characteristic and group membership, disproportionately affects the group; (2) that action effectively reinforces or creates ideas about what it means to be a group member; and (3) that group meaning conflicts with individual group members’ sense of self. In other words, sometimes the government relies on normative or statistical information about groups to address a group-                                                     15. Id. at 486.  16.

This tension is palpable in anti-stereotyping jurisprudence. On one hand, the anti-stereotyping principle typically requires the government to treat individuals as individuals. For example, even if most women would statistically be unsuited for the Virginia Military Institute’s adversative style of learning, the government cannot deny admission to all women on that basis.22 On the other hand, sometimes the government must address groups as groups. Justice O’Connor’s analysis was arguably progressive in Lawrence v. Texas,23 for example, by linking sodomy to gays and lesbians as a group when discussing why Texas’s same-sex sodomy ban violated the Equal Protection Clause: “[t]he Texas statute makes homosexuals unequal in the eyes of the law,” she explained, and it “brands all homosexuals as criminals.”24 To ignore this reality would have been sexual orientation blind in ways that both subordinated gays as a group vis-à-vis straights and denied individuals the liberty to have sex with the consenting adult persons of their choosing. Criminalizing sodomy had the effect of forbidding individuals from engaging in conduct that is important, and often central, to many members of the group. Yet not all homosexuals engage in “sodomy,” and many would bristle at the assertion that gay identity has anything to do with sex.25 Pairing sodomy with “all homosexuals” accounts for statistically relevant information about gays as a group, but it is also stereotyping. Take justifications for affirmative action programs as another example. In Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,26 the UC Davis Medical School argued that setting aside sixteen out of 100 positions in the entering class for racial minorities was necessary to achieve its interest in providing health care services to underserved minority communities.27 This is a progressive argument, and the Court conceded that “[i]t may be correct to assume that some of [the admitted minority students] . . . will practice in minority communities.”28 But not                                                      21.

The tension between liberty and anti-subordination comes into sharper relief when we consider the varied and expansive definitions of “stereotyping.” Statistical stereotypes, for instance, represent factual truths about the conduct, abilities, or lived experiences of most, but not all, members of a given group.30 Similarly, normative stereotypes reflect informal and largely agreed upon traits, tastes, artifacts, and conduct constitutive of group identities.31 Under these and other definitions, some scholars have gone so far as to equate stereotypes with culture.32 But as those who critically study identity have long argued, ignoring culture or being blind to it with respect to sex, race, and sexual orientation may reinforce group stratification, foster cultural appropriation, and otherwise subordinate minorities.33 Thus, we must ask, can the government protect vulnerable groups from subordination without sometimes stereotyping the individuals who comprise those groups? If not, when does government stereotyping amount to a constitutional wrong? This Article offers two novel contributions to the scholarly literature about Equal Protection jurisprudence. First, it argues that not all governmental stereotyping amounts to a constitutional violation, or is even harmful. How the government uses stereotypes is key. The distinction rests on whether the government’s use of stereotypes denies equal dignity. Second, this Article explores when stereotyping denies equal dignity. It uses Obergefell as the doctrinal anchor and then examines the federal judiciary’s prominent anti-stereotyping cases and recent developments in LGBTQ antidiscrimination law. This Article proposes that governmental stereotyping denies equal dignity and is thus                                                      Jurisprudential Approach, 75 COLUM. L.

This project is motivated in part by a desire to contextualize stereotypes and identify their dangers in a more sophisticated rather than reactionary way. Group-based experiences and problems are real, but legal discourse surrounding stereotypes tends to shift the focus to the individual at the expense of groups. One doctrinal solution could be for courts to define stereotypes narrowly and in a way that permits the government to productively consider normative and statistical information that is true of many but not all group members. Another solution is to develop a theory for when stereotyping, however defined, does not deny dignity. This Article attempts to do the latter. This Article focuses primarily on race-, sex-, and sexual orientation-based stereotyping, but emphasizes stereotyping concerns in LGBTQ antidiscrimination law. LGBTQ discrimination cases illustrate especially well how the anti-stereotyping principle must guard against both individual liberty deprivations and group subordination to achieve equality. In some cases, the government discriminates against individual gay and transgender people precisely because they are uniquely gender non-conforming and fail to match the normative stereotypes associated with their biological sex or the social dictates of heterosexuality. In other cases, the government discriminates against LGBTQ people as a group—usually by relying on false stereotypes and animus to deny services or benefits to which many LGBTQ people seek access (e.g., marriage), or by criminalizing or punishing conduct closely associated with LGBTQ culture and practices (e.g., “sodomy”). This Article proceeds as follows. Part I fleshes out the constitutional meaning of “dignity” based on how the Supreme Court uses it in Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process challenges. It then considers how the pro-liberty and anti-subordination themes of dignity converge in Obergefell, offering a guide for assessing the constitutional harm of stereotyping in past and future cases. Part II outlines three distinct definitions of stereotypes: false, normative, and statistical. In doing so, it explains how all three definitions can deny equal dignity. Part III discusses beneficial or “dignified” stereotyping. It first discusses group identities, and explores the tension between anti-essentialist and multiculturalist concerns. It then discusses dignified stereotyping in an LGBTQ context, offering examples for when the government may beneficially consider certain normative and statistical information about gays as a group: sodomy decriminalization, justifications for affirmative action policies, and disparate impact claims. 04 - Boso.docx (Do Not Delete) 10/9/2017  9:44 AM 1126 WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 92:1119  I. DEFINING EQUAL DIGNITY Conventional wisdom suggests that, when the government classifies on the basis of a quasi-suspect or suspect trait, governmental stereotyping is always forbidden. In Orr v. Orr,34 which dealt with the constitutionality of an Alabama statute requiring ex-husbands but not ex-wives to pay spousal support, the Supreme Court famously reasoned that “[l]egislative classifications which distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of gender carry the inherent risk of reinforcing the stereotypes about the ‘proper place’ of women and their need for special protection.”35 Pursuant to these concerns, the government must engage in individualized assessments if feasible when bestowing benefits or burdens rather than relying on stereotypes about race or sex.36 This individualistic focus is the hallmark of the Court’s current race-conscious affirmative action jurisprudence.37 Doctrinally, the anti-stereotyping principle does not apply every time the government classifies on the basis of group status;38 instead, it applies only when the government classifies on a quasi-suspect or suspect class. In those cases, there is a presumably greater need to ensure that prejudice about socially salient groups has not infected the decision-making process.39 Since the end of the notorious Lochner40 era, during which the Supreme Court carefully scrutinized and struck down                                                      34. 440 U.S. 268 (1979).  35.

See, e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 334 (2003) (race-conscious admissions programs require “truly individualized consideration” where race is used in a “flexible, nonmechanical way”).  38. “It is unlikely . . . that any gender classifications based on stereotypes can survive heightened scrutiny, but under rational scrutiny, a statute may be defended based on generalized classifications unsupported by empirical evidence.” Miller v.

Beazer,43 for example, the Court determined the constitutionality of a government policy that precluded the employment of anyone who uses methadone as treatment for heroin addiction, regardless of the applicant’s merits or time spent in successful treatment.44 The Court rejected an Equal Protection challenge to the policy, reasoning that, because the policy did not target “a class of persons characterized by some unpopular trait or affiliation,” it was not constitutionally significant that generalizations about the whole group of methadone users did not apply to all methadone users.45 Governmental reliance on stereotypes is thus permissible more often than not. The Supreme Court’s willingness to accept stereotyping in some contexts but not others is a frequent fixture of Equal Protection law. In J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.,46 the Court held that state actors may not strike potential jurors based solely on sex.47 To do so would perpetuate stereotypes about men and women.48 But the Court noted in J.E.B. that preliminary juror strikes based on membership in other groups do not pose constitutional problems, even if those strikes rely on stereotypes about group membership.49 The popular refrain is that all peremptory challenges are based on stereotypes of some kind, expressing various intuitive and frequently erroneous biases. But where peremptory challenges are made on the basis of group characteristics other than race or gender (like occupation, for example), they do not reinforce the                                                      41.

The other pillar functions to protect individuals’ liberty to define and express identity. Going forward, this Article examines how the Court invokes dignity under the Substantive Due Process Clause to protect decisional autonomy regarding identity and notions of self. It then examines how the Court invokes dignity under the Equal Protection Clause to protect oppressed groups from subordination. It also discusses how the Court in Obergefell ties these pro-liberty and anti-subordination threads together to strike down same-sex marriage bans as violating the equal dignity principle at the center of the Equal Protection Clause. Finally, it illustrates how equal dignity likewise animates the Equal Protection Clause’s anti-stereotyping doctrine. A. Liberty as Individual Decisional Autonomy In modern times, the Supreme Court emphasizes dignity as an important constitutional consideration in both Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection jurisprudence.51 As Reva Siegel explains, “constitutional protections for dignity vindicate, often concurrently, the value of life, the value of liberty, and the value of equality.”52 Early Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection cases in which the Court interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty guarantee hinged to a large degree on governmental respect for individual autonomy as a necessary means to promote human dignity. In Eisenstadt v. Baird,53 for example, the Court held that states cannot prohibit individuals from purchasing contraceptives because, if “the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual . . . to be free                                                      50.

This liberty also includes, among other things, the right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment so that individuals may “die with dignity,”57 and the right to privately express sexuality with another person so that individuals may “retain their dignity as free persons.”58 The right to make personal decisions about with whom we have sex, the composition of our families, and how our life will end fundamentally affects our identities and the kinds of existence we lead.59 Dignity requires that we acknowledge human beings as autonomous agents who make self-defining choices.60                                                      54.

Equality as Anti-Group Subordination The Court has also invoked dignity as a rationale for why dissimilar treatment of similarly situated groups is a constitutional wrong. A recent high-profile example comes from United States v. Windsor.61 There, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that defined marriage under all federal laws as solely between one man and one woman.62 The Court devoted significant time to a discussion about the respect, honor, and social standing63 that both the government and society ascribe to marriage.64 Because marriage is a positive right to which governmental benefits and responsibilities attach, the Court conceptualized the government’s role in determining who can obtain those rights and responsibilities as conferring “a dignity and status of immense import.”65 Focusing in large part on evidence of the government’s antigay animus, the Court determined that DOMA’s “essence” was to interfere with the “equal dignity” that some states had conferred on same-sex and different-sex couples alike by legalizing same-sex marriage.66 DOMA’s principle effect, the Court found, was to single out one group—individuals in state-sanctioned same-sex marriages—and make them unequal to individuals in different-sex marriages, which “demeans” gay and bisexual couples.67 The Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education68 is another poignant example of an equality case in which dignity played a role. In Brown, the Court unanimously held that public secondary schools cannot constitutionally operate on a formal racially segregated basis.69 As Ian Haney-López explains, the Warren Court did not search for discriminatory governmental intent in civil rights cases but instead found                                                      61. 570 U.S.__, 133 S.

Notably, the Court has never outlined a test or even a unifying theory of when state action subordinates a group. Professor Siegel notes that, while many scholars agree that anti-subordination is central to equal dignity’s guarantee, there is little consensus around what practices subordinate and why.74 Accordingly, this Article does not purport to create a test or rule for what subordination means and looks like in all contexts. Based on respected scholarly thought and Supreme Court analysis, however, governmental action that creates group hierarchies is                                                      70.

In other words, at the very least, the government subordinates when it acts with either the purpose or effect of disfavoring one similarly situated group over another, thus creating or reinforcing existing social hierarchies that tell outgroup members that they are inferior.75 Even this basic definition of subordination is complicated somewhat by the reality of intersectionality.76 Kimberlé Crenshaw first coined intersectionality as a theory to explain how individuals invariably have multiple identities that overlap and trigger unique experiences of oppression, thus creating seemingly infinite subgroups that may experience oppression differently depending on context.77 Nevertheless, it is possible to discern a subordinating purpose or effect even at the subgroup level without always privileging dominant configurations of group identity. Defining subordination as, at bare minimum, government action that disfavors a (sub)group should focus the analysis. C. Equal Dignity as Individual Decisional Autonomy and Anti-Group Subordination In sum, the Supreme Court’s Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process jurisprudence weave two prominent strains of dignity: one pro-liberty and the other anti-subordination.

In Obergefell, the Court considered the constitutionality of state laws that define marriage as between one man and one woman.79 This litigation capped a stunning series of victories in which LGBTQ plaintiffs won twenty-six of twenty-nine federal challenges to same-sex marriage bans in the two years following the Supreme Court’s Windsor decision striking down DOMA.80 The historical context leading to Obergefell is lengthy, fraught, and seminal in the fight for LGBTQ liberation and equality. Long before any federal court victories, however, in the immediate wake of the 1969 Stonewall riots, a handful of rogue same-sex couples formally began the legal movement for same-sex marriage.81 These brave women and men sought and were denied marriage licenses in a far less tolerant climate than today’s, and in an era in which formal legal service organizations and many of the LGBTQ community’s own members were hesitant to endorse same-sex marriage as a worthy political and legal goal.82 Same-sex marriage advocates did not score a formal legal victory until 1993, when the Hawaii Supreme Court held as colorable a claim that same-sex marriage bans may constitute sex discrimination under the Hawaii Constitution.83 It is these early pioneer plaintiffs and their attorneys who paved the way for the Court’s decision in Obergefell, handed down forty-six years after Stonewall. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Obergefell, and the two dignitary pillars of pro-individual liberty and anti-group subordination guide his analysis.

These laws by design confer benefits to one group (heterosexuals) that they withhold from another similarly situated group (lesbians, gays, and bisexuals), strongly signaling the government’s distaste for the latter group. Justice Kennedy was wise to forego a searching inquiry into whether antigay intent may have motivated this dissimilar treatment because, frankly, sex-differentiated marriage has existed “for millennia and across civilizations”89 and long before society’s recognition of homosexuals and bisexuals as a distinct social group.90 Nevertheless, after lesbians, gays, and bisexuals came into political consciousness and sought equal treatment, both old and new restrictive marriage laws conveyed the unmistakable message that same-sex sexuality is inferior to heterosexuality. The government’s strong preference for heterosexuality over homosexuality is well documented given its overt discrimination in employment,91 military service,92 and child custody and visitation                                                      84.

Beyond formally extending benefits to similarly situated groups on an equal basis, Justice Kennedy explains that equal dignity also means that all persons have the equal liberty “to define and express their identity”98 free from governmental subordination of a socially salient group to which they belong. This powerful identity-affirming language appears in the very first line of Obergefell,99 and it offers an expansive vision of both the liberty and equality guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

Douglas NeJaime explains that “[s]exual orientation by its very nature includes an active, relational component. Sexual orientation identity is linked to (both actual and contemplated) relationships with other bodies.”100 For some, then, “[e]ntering, performing, and publicly showing a same-sex relationship serves as a central way of embracing and maintaining one’s lesbian or gay identity.”101 Because governments typically favor heterosexuality, state actions actively promote possibilities and provide room for straight individuals to form identities around their sexual orientation, which, for many, requires a public and state-recognized marriage to a different-sex partner. Prohibiting this identity-affirming activity and denying formal relational status to LGB people as a group impedes individual liberty on an unequal and subordinating basis, and, therefore, violates the dignitary foundation underlying the Equal Protection Clause. Decisional autonomy has long been a feature of the Supreme Court’s Substantive Due Process jurisprudence. But never before Obergefell had the Court so clearly connected choices about identity to liberty,102 and never had equality so clearly included the liberty to express identity free from government subordination on the basis of group status.103 Moreover, Obergefell connects equality to a long line of decisional privacy cases104 under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses in which the Court protected individuals’ rights to not conform105 to prevailing social norms and mores.106 Obergefell makes clear that the government can no longer                                                      100.

Anti-Stereotyping as Equal Dignity The Supreme Court’s Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process jurisprudence, and the convergence of anti-subordination and pro-liberty principles at the heart of Obergefell’s equal dignity command, explain the harms of stereotyping and why it is constitutionally forbidden with respect to historically marginalized groups.109 Regarding sex classifications, the Supreme Court since the 1970s has reasoned that the government cannot act with either the purpose or effect of perpetuating stereotyped views about men and women.110 An examination of some of the federal judiciary’s key anti-stereotyping cases reveals that courts have long been skeptical of stereotyped thinking precisely because it carries the dual risks of group subordination and unequal individual liberty deprivation. Traditionally, courts most often invoke the anti-stereotyping doctrine to preclude overt forms of group subordination through exclusionary state action. When the government categorically treats men and women differently or excludes women outright from certain civic functions, governmental reliance on sex stereotypes reinforces a sex hierarchy with men on top, buttressing women’s perceived status as inferior.111 Noa Ben-Asher argues that courts tend to forbid sex stereotyping only when it reinforces sex hierarchies, and particularly when it limits women’s economic opportunities and men’s domestic opportunities.112 Anti-                                                     107.

Modern courts are increasingly reasoning that plaintiffs can bring discrimination claims when evidence suggests that a decision-maker treated the plaintiff differently due to his or her failure to conform to norms about appropriate gendered behavior.113 These courts are both guarding against status degradation and protecting individual identity choices. On one hand, modern anti-stereotyping decisions promote anti-subordination principles by freeing individuals from assigned roles that implicate the inferior or dominant status of the group to which they or others belong. On the other hand, these decisions also promote liberty by guarding individuals’ freedom to form and express identities without the government’s weighty hand dictating their behavioral and identitarian gender choices. Accordingly, anti-stereotyping at root is about protecting the equal dignity of every individual. For example, in a 2017 case, Sessions v. Morales-Santana,114 the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a sex-based immigration law that dictates the circumstances in which a child who is born abroad may acquire U.S. citizenship if one parent is not a U.S. citizen.115 The statute treats U.S. citizen mothers more favorably than U.S. citizen fathers,116 and the Court reasoned that this differential treatment is rooted in stereotypical assumptions about fathers’ relatively loose relationships with their children as compared to mothers, and mothers’ traditional role as child caretakers.117 Concluding its Equal Protection analysis, the Court explained that, because sex stereotypes undergird the disparate treatment of mothers and fathers, the statute violates the constitutional                                                      113.

The acquisition of citizenship differs significantly depending on whether the child’s father or mother is a U.S. citizen, making it much easier for the child’s mother to confer citizenship. The statute “requires a period of physical presence in the United States for the U.S.-citizen parent,” and, “currently, the requirement is five years prebirth.” Id.

It is important at this point to note that both pillars of equal dignity stand together. Protecting individual liberty presumably allows people to express their identities free of governmentally prescribed norms and roles. Without the anti-subordination component, however, individuals might claim that their identity expression requires the subordination of others. Contemporary debates over religious freedom offer a cautionary analogy. Today, religious individuals and businesses increasingly argue that antidiscrimination laws protecting LGBTQ individuals and women’s reproductive choices infringe on religious liberty.119 Courts that accept these claims effectively permit individuals’ religious liberty to trump equality principles. When the government exempts religious individuals from antidiscrimination laws, permitting denials of services or accommodations to certain people, this sends a subordinating message to those excluded: these “are actions that address third parties as sinners in ways that can stigmatize and demean.”120 To avoid this problem under an equal dignity theory of Equal Protection, the government may burden individuals’ identity expression as long as it does not also subordinate a historically oppressed group. In practice, the anti-subordination pillar may do most of the analytical work given that any practice that subordinates a historically oppressed group also likely denies individual group members the ability to express their identities on their own terms. Still, if the government acts in reliance on statistically relevant information about a historically oppressed group, does that action always both unequally deny individual identity expression and send a subordinating message about group status? Can the government progressively account for factual information about groups to address group-specific problems, even if the group-based information on which the government relies has the effect of conveying a message about the group that conflicts with individual group members’ sense of identity                                                      118.

To answer these questions, it is crucial to first determine what the term “stereotyping” in the anti-stereotyping principle means. The following analysis examines three different versions of stereotypes: false, normative, and statistical. As this analysis shows, “stereotyping” can be construed so broadly as to encompass governmental application of even statistically relevant group-based information. II. DEFINING STEREOTYPES What does it mean to call something a stereotype? Since at least the 1960s, the Supreme Court has excoriated state actors in Equal Protection cases when the purpose or effect of state action is to reinforce stereotypes about certain groups of people. In Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan,121 the Court ruled that a state-sponsored nursing school’s female-only enrollment policy was unconstitutional because it “tends to perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively woman’s job.”122 In statutory civil rights laws, like Title VII and Title IX, the federal judiciary has been similarly adamant that individuals should not suffer disparate treatment because they fail to conform to stereotypes associated with a group to which they belong. The most famous judicial decree under Title VII against stereotyping came in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,123 where the Court proclaimed that “we are beyond the day when an employer [can] evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group.”124 The Supreme Court has focused on the evils of stereotyping in a wide range of antidiscrimination contexts, including in race-based affirmative action policies, in peremptive juror strikes, and in policies affecting domestic relations between men and women. Yet despite a robust body of jurisprudence warning against stereotyping as a motivation for or effect of state and private action, the Court has never precisely defined the word “stereotype.”125                                                      121. 458 U.S. 718 (1982).  122.

In that vein, the Supreme Court once characterized stereotyping as “a frame of mind resulting from irrational or uncritical analysis.”126 An irrational or uncritical analysis is one that ignores or downplays evidence in favor of generalizations as a mental shortcut.127 As Jerry Kang explains, “a stereotype is an association between a social group and a specific trait”128 where “the correlation between social group and trait is far from perfect.”129 In a sense, however, these mental shortcuts are unavoidable, which in part explains why courts have been remiss to condemn them altogether. Linda Hamilton Krieger explains that stereotypes are “cognitive mechanisms that all people, not just ‘prejudiced’ ones, use to simplify the task of perceiving, processing, and retaining information about people in memory. They are central, and indeed essential, to normal cognitive functioning.”130 Charles Lawrence offers a similar depiction of stereotyping as a normal human sorting device, and identifies the moment at which this device causes harm as when the stereotyped thinking “eschews reality even when facts are available.”131 Not all stereotypes are born of reflexive and unthinking impulses. To the contrary, many stereotypes are based on available facts. In her dissenting opinion in Tuan Anh Nguyen v. I.N.S.,132 Justice O’Connor summarized much of the Court’s anti-stereotyping jurisprudence, explaining: “[t]his Court has long recognized . . . that an impermissible stereotype may enjoy empirical support and thus be in a sense ‘rational.’”133 O’Connor then cites for support the following language from J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.: “[w]e have made abundantly clear in past cases that gender classifications that rest on impermissible stereotypes violate the Equal Protection Clause, even when some statistical support can be conjured up for the generalization.”134 For                                                      126.

Both kinds of stereotyping may pose constitutional problems, however, because attention to individuals and context may lead to more accurate and less overbroad results.135 This Article proposes that the crux of stereotyping, false and true alike, is a focus on groups over individuals. Focusing on groups inevitably means ignoring or downplaying available evidence about an individual’s traits, capabilities, and perspectives, while giving greater or definitive weight to group-based generalizations. While this Article’s primary focus is on the Equal Protection Clause, courts’ analysis and the animating principles of equality and disparate treatment are substantially similar under both the Constitution and statutory antidiscrimination laws.136 Accordingly, this Article uses both Equal Protection and Title VII case law to illustrate the mechanics and harms of stereotyping as defined in three different ways. A. False Stereotyping Anthony Appiah suggests that at least three different versions of stereotyping can operate in law: false, normative, and statistical. First and most straightforwardly is false stereotyping, which includes “a false belief about a group.”137 In antidiscrimination law, false stereotyping occurs when an actor takes some action because of an incorrect belief that an individual possesses a group characteristic that is not actually common to the group.138 Even if some members of the group possess that characteristic, the actor’s association is still a false stereotype if these group members are no more likely than anyone else to possess the characteristic.139 It is easy to see why false stereotyping is harmful, particularly when false stereotypes are unambiguously negative. No individual should be subordinated or denied liberty due to baseless generalizations about their group membership. A common example in the LGBTQ context is the false stereotype that LGBTQ people, and especially gay men, are pedophiles. In same-sex marriage litigation, states and amici curiae argued that the government                                                      135. See id. at 90 (citing Miller v.

Social science studies support this finding.148 Federal and state governments have relied for decades on false stereotypes about the various sexual and social dangers that LGBTQ people present to keep queer adults away from children. Perhaps no part of the LGBTQ community has been hurt more by these false stereotypes than schoolteachers. William Eskridge explains that the “first antigay initiative to draw nationwide attention was Anita Bryant’s 1977 ‘Save Our Children’ campaign to repeal an antidiscrimination law adopted in Dade County, Florida.”149 Bryant focused specifically on the sexual and indoctrinating threats that openly gay teachers posed to children, and the initiative was ultimately successful.150 In 1978, the Briggs Initiative appeared on the California state ballot (eventually failing). It was, as Nan Hunter notes, “widely understood to be a vote on whether the state should fire gay teachers and thus purge that group from the schools and from contact with children.”151 These voter-initiated efforts were fueled by the familiar false stereotypes depicting gay people as “disgusting people and predatory child molesters.”152 Even today, teachers risk losing their jobs if they come out as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. In a 2008 Wyoming case, for example, a lesbian schoolteacher was fired after her students’ parents complained about her same-sex relationship: she lost her discrimination case before the Tenth Circuit.153 Famously, Marjorie Rowland was fired from her job as a school guidance counselor in Ohio when she came out to a co-worker as bisexual.154 Dissenting from the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari in                                                      148.

It is logical to assume that many of the same false stereotypes undergirding antigay initiatives aimed at school teachers across America at that time motivated the firing decision.156 False stereotyping violates both the anti-subordination and pro-liberty pillars of equal dignity. In Rowland v. Mad River Local School District,157 dissenting Justices Brennan and Marshall explained that this case raises important constitutional questions regarding individuals’ rights to “maintain and express their private sexual preferences.”158 This language sounds in the same register as Justice Kennedy’s emphasis in Obergefell on individuals’ rights “to define and express their identity” on an equal basis.159 These and other false stereotypes are often used to deny gay people the liberty to create and express their sexual identities in ways that are not denied to heterosexual individuals.160 It is highly unlikely that any school would fire a heterosexual woman simply for discussing her husband or disclosing that she had one. Moreover, false stereotypes also subordinate LGBTQ people. First, they subordinate in intangible ways by sending a clear message that homosexuality and bisexuality are inferior to heterosexuality. Second, they subordinate LGBTQ people in tangible ways by excluding them from opportunities in the market, relegating them to jobs that society deems appropriate for gay people. Simply put, false stereotyping is when the fit between the presumed group characteristic and the individual to whom that characteristic is ascribed is extremely poor or nonexistent. False stereotyping is the height of irrationality, and the government’s reliance on false stereotypes about any group to justify disparate treatment of individuals should be unconstitutional.                                                      155.

Normative Stereotyping Normative stereotyping is a second operative version in antidiscrimination law. As Professor Appiah explains, normative stereotyping involves taking some action due to beliefs about how an individual ought to behave based on his or her group membership.161 Whereas false stereotyping often implicates passive reliance on inaccurate group generalizations, normative stereotyping involves the active construction and policing of what group identity should be.162 LGBTQ individuals are all too aware of how normative stereotyping can materially disadvantage. Workplaces and schoolyards are riddled with bullies who harass sexual minorities and create a hostile environment because of a belief that men should be masculine and women should be feminine. In one well-known case, Prowel v. Wise Business Forms, Inc.,163 Brian Prowel, a gay man, was harassed at his workplace in rural Pennsylvania by his ostensibly straight coworkers. In Prowel’s words, the normative man at his workplace fit the following profile: “[b]lue jeans, t-shirt, blue collar worker, very rough around the edges. Most of the guys there hunted. Most of the guys there fished. If they drank, they drank beer, they didn’t drink gin and tonic. Just you know, all into football, sports, all that kind of stuff . . . .”164 By contrast, Prowel testified that, among his many other attributes, he “had a high voice and did not curse,” wore dressy clothes, “was neat,” “filed his nails instead of ripping them off with a utility knife,” crossed his legs in an effeminate manner, had a rainbow decal on his car, talked about “art, music, interior design, and décor,” and pushed machine buttons with “pizzazz.”165 Over two years, Prowel’s co-workers relentlessly tormented him and “mock[ed] his effeminate mannerisms and appearance.”166 They called him “Princess,” “Rosebud,” “fag,” and “faggot.”167 They left notes at his                                                      161. Appiah, supra note 30, at 48.  162. The specific normative stereotypes at play may differ according to context. See, e.g., Back v. Hastings on Hudson Union Free Sch. Dist., 365 F.3d 107, 119–21 (2d Cir. 2004) (explaining that what constitutes a gender-based stereotype depends on the “particular context” in which the question arises).

In fact, normative stereotyping is a ubiquitous mechanism for sorting and differentiating between men and women in workplaces, places of public accommodation, schools, and social life. When and whether normative stereotyping amounts to a constitutional or statutory wrong is thus a contextual and controversial question. As Robert Post argues, normative stereotypes about differences between men and women are the very “conventions that underwrite the social practice of gender,”175 and antidiscrimination law does not and should not obliterate gender altogether.176 Judith Butler, famous for her theories on the social construction of gender, concedes, “it is not clear that the elimination of gender is an undisputed political goal of feminism.”177 Courts have so far resisted calls to forbid all normative stereotyping, perhaps sensing that it is impossible and maybe even undesirable to render gender obsolete. Nowhere is this resistance more apparent than in                                                      168. Id.  169. Id. at 287–88.  170. Id. at 287.  171. Id.  172. Id. at 286.  173.

Harrah’s Operating Co.,179 in which plaintiff Darlene Jespersen was fired from her job as a bartender when she refused to wear makeup.180 Jespersen had worked in Harrah’s casino for twenty years before it instituted and enforced a new dress and grooming code policy.181 The policy, known as the “Personal Best” program, included some requirements that applied to men and women alike, including a “standard uniform of black pants, white shirt, black vest, and black bow tie.”182 In addition, the Personal Best program relied on normative gender stereotypes in the following key ways: for women, (1) “[h]air must be teased, curled, or styled” and always worn down; and (2) “[m]ake up (face powder, blush and mascara) must be worn and applied neatly in complimentary colors. Lip color must be worn at all times.”183 The Personal Best program expressly forbade men from wearing makeup.184 Darlene Jespersen sued Harrah’s, arguing that the Personal Best program unlawfully treated men and women differently on the basis of sex.185 Specifically, Jespersen claimed that the program required that “women conform to sex-based stereotypes as a term and condition of employment.”186 The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sitting en banc rejected Jespersen’s claims, invoking a theory of sex discrimination that permits policy differentiations between men and women provided that the policy does not impose “unequal burdens.”187 In a somewhat baffling analysis, the Court also rejected the contention that the Personal Best program had either the purpose or effect of requiring men and women to adhere to normative gender stereotypes.188                                                      178.

Prowel’s coworkers presumably wanted him to be manlier—perhaps by fishing, hunting, looking rougher rather than tidy, and, most importantly, being straight. Jespersen’s employer wanted her to be more feminine by conforming to norms of female beauty, which apparently deem women’s natural faces unacceptable.189 What accounts for these different outcomes? Why did normative stereotyping suggest sex discrimination for Prowel and not for Jespersen? As Professor Ben-Asher argues, courts historically treated subordination, particularly regarding group-based exclusion from opportunities in the marketplace, as the overriding wrong of stereotyping.190 Under this theory, normative stereotyping is unlawful when it subordinates men or women by pigeon-holing individuals into specific sex roles at work or home, thereby limiting market opportunities.191 In Prowel, the ways in which Brian Prowel’s coworkers deployed normative stereotypes ignored his individual skills and tangibly obstructed his ability to earn a living. Because of his sex, he was excluded from opportunity. The Third Circuit noted that his “work environment became so stressful that he had to stop his car on the way to work to vomit.”192 In Jespersen, by contrast, the Ninth Circuit found no evidence “to suggest the grooming standards would objectively inhibit a woman’s ability to do the job.”193 The court went on to state that the “only evidence in the record to support the stereotyping claim is Jespersen’s own subjective reaction to the makeup requirement.”194 The Ninth Circuit’s decision in Jespersen supports Professor Ben-Asher’s observations: whether normative stereotyping is unlawful, or even recognized as stereotyping, often turns on whether it subordinates by denying equal opportunity due to group status. The Jespersen court ignores how normative stereotyping also denies individual liberty; the court is indifferent to a person’s “subjective reaction” and resistance to requirements that he or she conform to conventional notions of masculinity and femininity. This is particularly problematic for LGBTQ                                                      189. See Jennifer C.

In early litigation, most courts failed even to recognize how normative stereotyping permeates the disparate treatment of transgender individuals.197 In Etsitty v. Utah Transit Authority,198 for example, Krystal Etsitty’s employer terminated her employment after she “began wearing makeup, jewelry, and acrylic nails,” and after she began using women’s restrooms while at work.199 The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals first rejected the claim that discrimination on the basis of an individual’s identity as transgender is per se sex discrimination.200 Next, the court rejected the claim, due to insufficient evidence, that Etsitty was “a biological male who was discriminated against for failing to conform to social stereotypes about how a man should act and appear.”201 The court did not understand that requiring a transwoman to wear men’s clothing and use restrooms consistent with the male sex that she was assigned at birth is a demand for gender conformity—a demand that a transwoman “act like a man.” Recently, and in a welcome development, some courts are beginning to understand how transgender discrimination involves normative stereotyping. In Barnes v. City of Cincinnati,202 the Sixth Circuit permitted a transgender individual’s sex discrimination claim to go forward because she alleged that her demotion in the police department                                                      195. See, e.g., Centola v. Potter, 183 F. Supp. 2d 403, 410 (D. Mass. 2002) (noting that antigay harassment is often categorically sex discrimination because the gender stereotype at work is: “‘real’ men should date women” and vice versa).  196. See, e.g., Pizer, supra note 189, at 286–87 (noting that LGBTQ individuals are disproportionately burdened by gendered dress and appearance codes).  197. The earliest cases to reject sex discrimination claims by transgender individuals made the facile distinction between sex classifications and transgender classifications, concluding that the former are impermissible while the latter are not. See Ulane v. E. Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081, 1086 (7th Cir. 1984) (“to include transsexuals within the reach of Title VII far exceeds mere statutory interpretation” because “Congress had a narrow view of sex in mind”); Holloway v. Arthur Anderson & Co., 566 F.2d 659, 663 (9th Cir. 1977) (“[t]his court cannot conclude that transsexuals are a suspect class” under the Equal Protection Clause). 198. 502 F.3d 1215 (10th Cir. 2007).  199.

Brumby,204 the Eleventh Circuit answered in the affirmative the question of whether discrimination against transgender individuals constitutes sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause: “[a] person is defined as transgender precisely because of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes,” and there “is thus a congruence between discriminating against transgender and transsexual individuals and discrimination on the basis of gender-based behavioral norms.”205 Governmental discrimination against transgender individuals also sends the subordinating message that trans people as a group are inferior to cisgender people as a group. That message rang loud and clear when the North Carolina legislature—in a rushed special session that was the first of its kind in thirty-five years206—passed a sweeping antigay and anti-trans bill (HB2) in the spring of 2016. HB2 eliminated all local antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people and required transgender individuals to use public restrooms that match their biological sex.207 The ACLU promptly sued North Carolina, arguing that North Carolina enacted HB2 out of LGBTQ animus, and because of its adverse effects on LGBTQ people.208 The Obama administration also filed suit, arguing that HB2, and specifically its provisions requiring that transgender individuals use the restroom corresponding to their biological sex, is a violation of the anti-stereotyping principle underlying several federal antidiscrimination laws.209 In public statements explaining the administration’s lawsuit, Attorney General Loretta Lynch spoke directly and empathetically to the transgender community: “[w]hat                                                      203.

A biological man may now identify as a woman, wear acrylic nails, and use the women’s restroom if she so chooses, as long as biological women are equally permitted to do so.211 Even these relatively progressive cases, however, offer a cramped vision of equal liberty. Many transgender individuals reject sex and gender binaries,212 forming and expressing identities that rely not on a framework of fixed categories but on a spectrum of fluid sex- and gender-expressions.213 Further, as Jespersen demonstrates, courts have ruled that individuals may only express their gender identities in accordance with dress and grooming codes that rely on a binary sex model.214 In other words, courts are beginning to prohibit the government and private entities from insisting that individuals identify and express gender congruently with their biological sex, but those individuals may only express their gender in ways deemed normatively appropriate for men and women (depending on how the individual identifies).215 Much legal work remains before equality law guarantees a robust vision of equal dignity that protects                                                      210.

As this point subtly illustrates, one key problem with these anti-stereotyping cases is that a transwoman must frame herself as a biological male who was punished for acting like a woman; in other words, she must uncomfortably position her female self-identity against her male assignation to fit the gender stereotyping theory. 212. See, e.g., Dean Spade, Resisting Medicine, Re/modeling Gender, 18 BERKELEY WOMEN’S L.J. 15, 23–24 (2003) (discussing how the medical model of transgender identity and status legitimizes a binary gender system).

In truth, normative stereotypes often reflect majoritarian beliefs about group membership that many individual group members may not find offensive. Lots of women, for example, do not object to grooming policies that mandate makeup.216 Nevertheless, normative stereotyping can be harmful when, like false stereotyping, it both (1) subordinates individuals by keeping them locked in fixed patterns of group oriented conduct that may have broad social implications about that group’s standing and value; and (2) denies individual autonomy to express identity not tethered to someone else’s beliefs about what group membership means or should mean. This is precisely the kind of stereotyping that kept Ann Hopkins—who famously lost a job promotion because she needed to “walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry”217—from expressing her identity as a woman on her own terms, which in turn perpetuated the group subordination of women in the workplace. C. Statistical Stereotyping For antidiscrimination law, statistical stereotyping is perhaps the most vexing. When can the government account for statistically relevant information about a group when it enacts a policy that responds to that group’s needs, capabilities, or interests? Does governmental reliance on that information constitute stereotyping? Does reliance on certain statistical truths reinforce stereotypes, keeping in motion self-perpetuating and self-justifying cycles of discrimination?218 Consider a public health example regarding a drug called Truvada, which doctors now regularly prescribe to certain high-risk individuals as                                                      216. “[S]ome women are sufficiently accustomed to wearing makeup” and “consider it inoffensive and nonremarkable.” Pizer, supra note 189, at 311. 217.

As Professor Appiah explains, statistical stereotyping involves (1) a statistically true correlation between some characteristic and group membership, and (2) ascribing or applying that characteristic to an individual group member.223 Thus, the government engages in statistical stereotyping whenever policy hinges on statistical data tied to group membership rather than an evaluation of individuals’ characteristics.224 Statistical stereotyping is necessarily pervasive.

The potential problem with statistical stereotyping is that individuals are often atypical of their groups.225 When the government acts on the basis of statistical information about groups, and that information does not reflect reality for a particular individual, that individual may be impacted unfairly. 1. The Supreme Court’s Sex-Based Statistical Stereotyping Jurisprudence In several important cases, the Supreme Court has responded with opprobrium when the government relies on statistical stereotypes to justify discriminatory policies that treat men and women as groups differently. Consider the following three examples. First, in United States v. Virginia,226 the United States sued the state of Virginia after a female high school student sought and was denied admission to the Virginia Military Institute (VMI).227 In the two years prior to the lawsuit’s initiation, 347 women inquired about enrollment at VMI, yet VMI’s formal policy precluded female admissions.228 VMI defended its male-only admissions policy in part by asserting that it had an important (“exceedingly persuasive”) interest in preserving the rigorous and physically demanding adversative educational program that it used to teach cadets.229 VMI argued that admitting women would require “radical,” “drastic,” and ultimately destructive modifications.230 Namely, VMI would have to modify “housing assignments and physical training programs for female cadets,” as well as the adversative method itself.231 VMI made these arguments in partial reliance on the findings of a Task Force compromised of experts in educating women at the college level.232 The Task Force found that “a military model and, especially VMI’s adversative method, would be wholly inappropriate for educating and training most women,”233 and “while ‘some women would be suited                                                      225.

The Court did not dismiss evidence of statistical differences between men and women, and in fact “assumed, for purposes of this decision, that most women would not choose VMI’s adversative method.”235 Nevertheless, the Court did not permit the government to rely on these statistical stereotypes because it should instead focus on the individual women “who have the will and capacity” to endure the adversative program.236 Accordingly, even if VMI could prove a strong statistical correlation between women as a group and certain characteristics that do not mesh well with VMI’s educational program—such as relatively less physical strength compared to men, and a preference for a softer educational style—these statistical facts do not matter under the Equal Protection Clause. VMI simply cannot engage in “categorical exclusion” of women “in total disregard of their individual merit.”237 In Craig v. Boren,238 as a second example, the Court struck down an Oklahoma statute that differentiated when individuals can buy non-intoxicating beer based solely on sex: women could purchase when they turned eighteen years old, but men had to wait until they were twenty-one.239 Oklahoma defended this sex classification by introducing statistical evidence of male and female differences regarding drunkenness, driving under the influence, and automobile fatalities.240 The Court responded: “[e]ven were this statistical evidence accepted as accurate, it nevertheless offers only a weak answer to the equal protection question presented here.”241 The statistical differences themselves, the Court worried, likely reflect social stereotypes wherein “‘reckless’ young men who drink and drive are transformed into arrest statistics, whereas their female counterparts are chivalrously escorted home.”242                                                      234.

Percolating in the Court’s analysis is precisely this concern: alcohol laws that facially burden men more than women have the actual effect of subordinating women by keeping young women dependent on men as their presumably sober chauffeurs and guardians. In turn, young men who drive while taking young women out on dates, and who are legally required to remain sober while their date may drink non-intoxicating alcohol, may nevertheless drink on the date and engage in drunk driving. Third and finally, in J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., Alabama filed a complaint on behalf of a mother seeking a paternity determination and child support payments against the presumed father of her minor child.243 During jury selection, the State used nine of its ten peremptory strikes to remove male jurors, and the jury ultimately consisted entirely of women.244 On appeal after trial, at which the all-woman jury found J.E.B. to be the biological father and liable for child support payments, the Supreme Court began its analysis of the sex-based peremptory strikes by detailing the history of women’s exclusion from jury service.245 It then explained why all sex classifications receive heightened judicial scrutiny: because of the “real danger” that sex classifications may reflect “outdated misconceptions concerning the role of females in the home rather than in the ‘marketplace and world of ideas.’”246 The State went on to defend its sex-based peremptory strikes by relying on statistical stereotypes about male and female differences in their relative biases and sympathies. [M]en otherwise totally qualified to serve upon a jury in any case might be more sympathetic and receptive to the arguments of a man alleged in a paternity action to be the father of an out-of-wedlock child, while women equally qualified to serve upon a jury might be more sympathetic and receptive to the arguments of the complaining witness who bore the child.247 The State cited one empirical study purporting to show some difference in how men and women judge in gendered cases.248 The Court                                                      243.

Contemporary Examples of LGBTQ Statistical Stereotyping Consider the FDA’s stance on whether gay and bisexual men are eligible to donate blood and sperm. In the wake of a June 2016 shooting at an Orlando, Florida gay bar that left forty-nine people dead and fifty-three others hospitalized, the LGBTQ community came forward in droves to grieve, connect with loved ones, and donate blood.251 Many gay and bisexual men were shocked to find out that they were ineligible to donate.252 After the deadliest mass shooting in modern history in which one person targeted the LGBTQ community with extreme violence, gay and bisexual men who wanted to donate blood to help their injured friends and family were turned away—shut out from assisting their own community when it needed them, and when they needed it most. Before December 2015, the FDA flatly prohibited any man who had had sex with another man since 1977 from donating blood.253 The FDA has since tweaked its policy, and it now recommends barring from donation men who have sex with men only if they have been sexually active within the last year.254 Similarly, the FDA requires any entity that                                                      249.

The federal government cites statistics to justify these policies,257 pointing to data showing that men who have sex with men comprise the group most likely to contract HIV in the United States.258 While statistical data may show that gay and bisexual men as a group are more likely to contract HIV than other groups,259 obviously not all individual gay and bisexual men have HIV or engage in the kinds of risky conduct that can lead to infection. These individual men suffer a dignitary harm at the hands of the government. The government is telling them that they are less worthy and even subordinate to straight men in the exercise of a vital public service. This subordination is particularly pronounced given that the FDA does not presume that straight men are likely to have HIV simply because of their sexuality, regardless of how many sexual partners a straight man has had or whether he has engaged in unprotected oral, anal, or vaginal sex.260 Moreover, the government’s reliance on statistical stereotypes subordinates gay and bisexual men because an individual assessment of infection is readily available. In fact, the FDA’s own rules and guidelines provide for rigorous testing of all blood donations, and these tests are almost 100% effective in screening for HIV antibodies and the virus itself.261 The FDA’s protocol for testing sperm donations is even                                                      on/Guidances/Blood/UCM446580.pdf (last visited Aug. 24, 2017) (“Defer for 12 months from the most recent sexual contact, a man who has had sex with another man during the past 12 months.”).  255. 21 C.F.R. § 1271.75(a), (d) (2015). 256.

There are signs of positive change in some federal courts. In a case comparable to the Supreme Court’s J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B. decision, the Ninth Circuit in SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories implicitly recognized that statistical stereotypes about gays as a group, when used to justify peremptory jury strikes, can both subordinate and deny equal liberty.263 The litigation at issue in SmithKline involved two pharmaceutical companies and their disputes over certain HIV medications.264 During jury selection, “Abbott used its first peremptory strike against the only self-identified gay member of the venire.”265 In addition to indicating that he has a male partner, the potential juror also revealed that he takes a medication produced by defendants, and that he has HIV-positive friends (who theoretically could have an interest in defendants’ HIV-related medications).266 Despite these facts, the Ninth Circuit found a “prima facie case of intentional discrimination” because the potential juror was “the only juror to have identified himself as gay on the record, and the subject matter of the litigation,” HIV medications, “presented an issue of consequence to the gay community.”267 Given the devastating toll that HIV and AIDS have had on gay and bisexual men, it is not unreasonable to presume that gay men may statistically care more about HIV medications than the general population. Nevertheless, the court rejected an interest in HIV/AIDS related issues as a characteristic statistically correlated to the LGBTQ community as a reason for striking a gay juror. The court began its analysis by hitting chords of anti-subordination, stating emphatically that “[g]ays and lesbians have been systematically excluded from the most important institutions of self-governance.”268 To exclude gay men from juries in trials involving gay related issues would perpetuate this systematic exclusion of gay people from civic life.269 Sexual orientation-                                                     on Gay Blood, 14 U.

Using the LGBTQ community’s heightened interest in LGBTQ issues as a foundation for exclusion is reminiscent of the public controversy over Judge Vaughn Walker, who famously presided over the Proposition 8 trial. In Perry v. Schwarzenegger,273 plaintiffs in same-sex relationships challenged California’s voter-enacted constitutional amendment that redefined marriage as only between a man and a woman.274 After the trial, in which Judge Walker found Proposition 8 to be unconstitutional, Judge Walker retired, came out as gay, and revealed that he was in a long-term same-sex relationship.275 Proponents of Proposition 8 then filed a motion seeking to vacate the judgment, implicitly arguing that Judge Walker’s status as gay and in a same-sex relationship affected his judgment in the case.276 Although the proponents did not argue that gay judges are per se biased in cases affecting LGBTQ rights,277 an argument to that effect could likely be supported by statistical evidence showing the relatively unsurprising finding that gay-identified individuals largely favor gay rights.278 A federal judge nevertheless ruled against the proponents, reasoning that the fact that a judge shares characteristics with those members of the                                                      treating gays and lesbians as undeserving of participation in our nation’s most cherished rites and rituals.” Id. at 485.  270.

In fact, the attempt to discredit Judge Walker is just one instance in a history of litigants’ unsuccessful attempts to remove minority judges from cases involving civil rights.279 Crediting statistical stereotypes about group biases and political sentiments as a justification for excluding women, people of color, and LGBTQ individuals from the justice system would further subordinate groups that exist outside of the majority and have relatively little political power. D. Recap: How False, Normative, and Statistical Stereotyping Can Deny Equal Dignity In the summer of 2016, Donald Trump, then the Republican nominee for President, came under intense political fire when he criticized the federal judge overseeing a fraud case against Trump University.280 Donald Trump argued that Judge Gonzalo Curiel could not be impartial in the class action suit against Trump because Judge Curiel is of “Mexican” heritage and was a member of the La Raza Lawyers Association.281 Meanwhile, Trump had previously stated publicly that Mexican immigrants are “criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.,”282 and a core component of his political platform was that the U.S. would “build a wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border to curtail illegal immigration.283 Perhaps Trump’s assumptions about Judge Curiel’s potential biases due                                                      279.

Here, the United States sued to end segregation of Alabama’s institutions of higher learning, and various individuals intervened as plaintiffs. Id. at 1534–35. Appellants argued that Judge Clemon—a Black man with two minor children who were members of the plaintiff class—was disqualified from hearing the case in part because his impartiality could reasonably be questioned.

Or, perhaps they are rooted in statistics, especially considering that the vast majority of Latino Americans had a strongly negative view of Donald Trump during his run for the Presidency.284 Either way, in this context, these assumptions operate to subordinate groups of color and other marginalized communities in America by seeking to deny them rights and responsibilities, and by sending the message that they are less trustworthy than the white majority. Parts I and II have thus far summarized one theory of equal dignity that lies at the heart of the Equal Protection Clause while also articulating three versions of stereotyping that may be unconstitutional deprivations of equal dignity depending on context. The three variations of stereotyping—false, normative, and statistical—are sweeping and offer an uncomfortable takeaway: whenever the government enacts policies that affect individuals based on assumptions about groups, even if most people believe those assumptions to be normatively true or if the link between the characteristic and the group is statistically relevant, the government engages in stereotyping. The Supreme Court has tempered the consequences of characterizing all group-based governmental policymaking as potentially unconstitutional stereotyping by reviewing carefully only those classifications that are suspect or quasi-suspect.285 In other words, the judiciary applies heightened scrutiny to classifications that rest on a socially salient status where the risk of political disempowerment286 and                                                      284.

L. REV. 975, 978 (2014).  286. A group’s relative lack of political power in part determines whether courts will review governmental classifications based on that group status with heightened scrutiny; this prong of suspect class doctrine originated in United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938). Professor Jane Schacter explains, however, that courts do not agree on how to assess a group’s political power or why political powerlessness is an important factor, nor do courts consistently evaluate political power in determining which group classifications should receive heightened scrutiny. Jane S. Schacter, Ely at the Altar: Political Process Theory Through the Lens of the Marriage Debate, 109 MICH. L. REV. 1363, 1372–77 (2011).

Race is the emblematic suspect classification,288 whereas sex is quasi-suspect.289 In part because women and people of color have suffered a long history of discrimination and remain structurally subordinate in the United States, the government’s reliance on race- and sex-based stereotypes raises a red flag regarding the purpose and effect of the government’s actions. Thus, suspect and quasi-suspect status doctrines originally developed as means to judicially protect women and people of color from burdensome governmental action, even as conservative ideological commitments have subverted those doctrines in the years since their inception to limit racial and feminist progress.290 In light of the risk that sex and race classifications come loaded with prejudicial baggage that tends to subordinate rather than liberate, the Supreme Court has largely rejected the government’s reliance on stereotypes as appropriate ends and means for enacting policy.291 The Court has instead emphasized the importance of equal treatment across the board irrespective of group status and individualized assessments when differential treatment is necessary, eschewing even relevant statistical differences between groups. As Cornelia Pillard explains, “even statistically accurate generalizations about ‘typically male or female tendencies’—such as men’s greater aggressiveness versus                                                      287. Race is the paradigmatic example. As the Supreme Court explained in Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432 (1984), “[c]lassifying persons according to their race is more likely to reflect racial prejudice than legitimate public concerns.”  288. Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 216 (1944) (declaring for the first time that “all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect”).  289. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976) (holding that sex classifications warrant intermediate scrutiny, which requires a slightly less close fit between governmental means and ends). One of the reasons that sex is not subject to strict scrutiny is because “real differences” between men and women may sometimes justify differential treatment. Justice Ginsburg noted in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), that “‘[i]nherent differences’ between men and women . . . remain cause for celebration.”  290. In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), the Supreme Court ruled that all race-based classifications—even those meant to benefit racial minorities—warrant heightened scrutiny due to a need for judicial consistency. See id. at 229–30. The Court’s conservative members all joined this opinion (while the liberals dissented), and the majority opinion is widely understood as an attempt to limit the use of race-based affirmative action in response to right-wing activism. See, e.g., Russell K. Robinson, Marriage Equality and Postracialism, 61 UCLA L. REV. 1010, 1062 (2014) (citing Adarand as an example of how the Supreme Court uses strict scrutiny “to scrutinize closely and often invalidate race-based policies meant to address racial subordination,” effectively “protect[ing] white claimants”). 291.

Boren, and J.E.B., one rationale for rejecting even statistical stereotypes is to guard against the risk that the government may use that statistical information to subordinate women, or that the statistics themselves reflect normative stereotypes.293 Women as a group have historically been oppressed in both the public and domestic sphere, and the Court’s heightened scrutiny of sex classifications and rejection of most stereotypes seeks to combat that subordination.294 Moreover, governmental stereotyping can deny individuals the equal liberty to create and express an identity free from predetermined roles and their attendant social meanings. These are the two core pillars of equal dignity. The government can also deny equal dignity, however, to individuals who are not members of suspect or quasi-suspect groups. The LGBT community provides perhaps the best example of a group that, while never considered suspect or quasi-suspect for Equal Protection purposes by the Supreme Court,295 has regularly been denied equal dignity at the hands of the government. Historic and ongoing discrimination strongly suggests that the Court should review sexual orientation and gender identity classifications under a heightened standard of review, and dozens of scholars have well-argued that case.296 This Article does not                                                      292.

Instead, it demonstrates how the anti-stereotyping principle should work to promote equal dignity even when courts apply rational basis review to certain classifications, such as sexual orientation.297 Moreover, to the extent that the Supreme Court has emphasized subordination as the predominant wrong of stereotyping, the sexual orientation and transgender discrimination cases uniquely highlight how stereotyping can infringe on the other tenet of equal dignity: the equal liberty to make choices regarding the formation and expression of identity. III. STEREOTYPING THAT DOES NOT DENY EQUAL DIGNITY This Article has devoted considerable time to discussing cases in which courts have rejected or should reject the government’s reliance on false, normative, and statistical stereotypes about groups when acting in ways that affect individual group members. But does stereotyping always deny equal dignity? One negative consequence of a robust anti-stereotyping doctrine that looks with skepticism at all group generalizations is an elevation of individuals at the expense of groups. An anti-stereotyping doctrine that applies forcefully any time the government acts to address a group organized around a suspect or quasi-suspect trait, regardless of the government’s purpose or effect in relying on stereotypes, suggests that the government can rarely if ever take group correlated traits and behaviors into account. As antidiscrimination scholars have long argued, however, groups do matter.298 The following analysis offers an explanation for why and examples of when it may be desirable for the government to take certain normative and statistical stereotypes into account when crafting policies.                                                      297. Because the Supreme Court has used strict scrutiny “consistently” under Adarand principles, applying strict scrutiny to classifications that both burden and benefit people of color, some scholars have resisted calls to elevate sexual orientation to suspect status. This resistance is motivated by fears that the judiciary will use strict scrutiny to thwart progressive goals. See, e.g., Robinson, supra note 295, at 172–73 (noting that strict scrutiny “rarely benefits people of color because modern racial discrimination does not rely on overt racial classifications to do its dirty work,” while still advocating for a transparent application of heightened scrutiny to sexual orientation-based Equal Protection claims).

Group Cultures Groups are exceedingly important for socially stigmatized individuals: for many individuals, groups offer safety and solidarity, an avenue for political mobilization to achieve shared goals, and a template for creating nuanced and fully formed identities among other like-minded people who share similar experiences, viewpoints, and cultures. Still, claims about group identity and group cultures are controversial. Such claims risk essentializing individual identities tied to group membership, “engaging in the very stereotyping that the antidiscrimination paradigm is meant to retire.”299 Essentialization has proven problematic for courts that attempt to sniff out discriminatory intent in statutory disparate treatment claims when determining whether a defendant’s consideration of cultural proxies proves that discriminatory treatment is “because of” a protected trait.300 Devon Carbado and Mitu Gulati explain that this task is dangerous because it could “entrench particular expressions of identity.”301 For example, “to say that a firm discriminated against [hypothetical plaintiff] because she acted black risks establishing—as a matter of law—what it means to be black based on the conduct in which [she] engaged.”302 In other words, what does it mean to “act black,” and does a court itself engage in stereotyping if it gleans through subtle evidentiary cues that a defendant discriminated against an individual due to the individual’s cultural manifestations of blackness? Richard Ford directly tackles these questions303 in his examination of the famous Rogers v. American Airlines, Inc.304 case. In Rogers, American Airlines enforced a grooming policy that prohibited male and female employees “from wearing an all-braided hairstyle.”305 The plaintiff, a Black woman, sued under Title VII, arguing that the policy constituted facial race discrimination.306 Underlying plaintiff’s claim is                                                      299.

She held herself out to the world as a Black woman.319 Dolezal’s performance, Beydoun and Wilson argue, is appropriation done with the purpose and certainly the effect of commodifying a non-white racial identity for personal gain at the expense of communities of color.320 To acknowledge Dolezal’s identity performance as reflective of Black culture in some sense reinforces stereotypes about what being Black means. Conversely, ignoring how Dolezal’s identity pulls from Black culture would be colorblind in a way that perpetuates ignorance about how majority groups can exploit marginalized communities without compensation or attribution, further subordinating the already oppressed.321 To the point: an anti-stereotyping doctrine that rejects as                                                      316.

This is the crux of Obergefell’s emphasis on equal dignity. Sometimes, however, the government’s failure to consider group-based normative or statistical stereotypes can subordinate groups and unequally deny liberty. Consider the Supreme Court’s controversial decision in Hernandez v. New York.325 In Hernandez, the petitioner, Dionisio Hernandez, was charged and convicted of two counts of murder and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.326 At the petitioner’s trial, a New York prosecutor used four peremptory challenges to exclude potential Latino jurors.327 The potential jurors’ Spanish fluency—and specifically the potential jurors’ ability to listen and follow the official interpreter when Spanish speaking witnesses took the stand—was the prosecutor’s stated rationale for two of those strikes,328 and petitioner challenged the exclusion of those two potential jurors as unconstitutional race discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.329 Petitioner relied on the “close relation” between Spanish fluency and Latino identity to make his claim of intentional race discrimination.330 The Court rejected the petitioner’s claim, reasoning that, while exercising peremptive strikes against individuals who speak Spanish “might well result in the                                                      of cultural appropriation enables dominant groups to maintain power).  322.

The Court went on to note that “[i]t may well be, for certain ethnic groups and in some communities, that proficiency in a particular language, like skin color, should be treated as a surrogate for race under an equal protection analysis”332—but not in this case. The Court accepted as valid the prosecutor’s concern that these individual potential jurors might have difficulty accepting an interpreter’s rendition of Spanish language testimony, and the group of persons for whom that concern applied consisted of both Latinos and non-Latinos.333 Not all Latino individuals speak Spanish, of course. Yet statistically, more Latinos do speak Spanish than non-Latinos, and Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the majority in Hernandez recognizes as common knowledge that a “significant percentage of the Latino population speaks fluent Spanish” and consider it the language “used to define the self.”334 Imagine a law that required English fluency to vote: ignoring the connection between Spanish fluency and Latino identity in the context of upholding such a law under an Equal Protection challenge would effectively validate race discrimination through exclusion. Similarly, the Hernandez Court’s refusal to view Spanish-speaking as a proxy for race (i.e., a statistically significant stereotype)335 in the context of excluding individuals from a jury denies equal dignity. In effect, “given the widely understood connection between Spanish fluency and cultural identity,”336 and the historical and ongoing discrimination against Latinos in the United States, the exclusion of some Spanish speakers from jury service in Hernandez sends a subordinating message of Latino group inferiority.337 Further, it denies liberty on an unequal basis: no English-speaking person would be excluded from performing a core civic duty on the basis of concerns about how their English language fluency affects their ability to follow instructions,338 and English fluency                                                      331.

It is important to note that recognizing group-based differences in culture, lived experiences, and other quirks of life does not necessarily mean naturalizing those differences. As Vicki Schultz argues, activists and lawyers should seek to disrupt differences by questioning their “origins and stability.”339 Those in power often use real and imagined differences between groups precisely to deny opportunity and create inequality. Those in power have also engaged in discriminatory conduct that effectively produces the very differences upon which others rely to perpetuate existing inequalities.340 Institutional actors nevertheless can and should account for statistical and normative group-based differences to combat rather than fuel oppression. B. The Case of LGBTQ Equality In Kenji Yoshino’s seminal work, Covering, he explores the myriad ways that law and society encourage lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals to tamp down the queer components of their identities.341 Covering is about assimilation, or trying to fit into mainstream life by helping others overlook a stigmatized aspect of self.342 For queer individuals, majority imposed and minority imposed covering demands343 may only become even more common as mainstream society lurches towards greater acceptance of LGBTQ people in theory but not necessarily LGBTQ people in practice.344 Underlying the practice of covering is the idea that identity is performative, and that certain behaviors are recognizable as constitutive of group-based identities.345 Professor Yoshino makes this point in                                                      339.

Sodomy On August 3, 1982, an Atlanta policeman entered Michael Hardwick’s home to issue an arrest warrant on an unrelated charge and witnessed Hardwick having oral sex with another man.348 At the time, having oral or anal sex—i.e., committing sodomy—was a crime in Georgia.349 The ACLU brought suit in federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that Georgia’s anti-sodomy statute was unconstitutional.350 Famously, Hardwick’s case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.351 Although the Georgia law at issue criminalized all acts of sodomy and not just those committed between two people of the same sex, the Court analyzed the statute’s constitutionality as if it only applied to same-sex oral and anal sex.352 Viewed in a generous light,353 perhaps the Court’s singular focus on same-sex sodomy makes some sense: in an amicus brief, Lambda Legal argued that laws like Georgia’s “impose an added burden on gay people, blocking their sense                                                      personhood . . . .”).

Texas struck down a Texas law that did single out same-sex sodomy for unique prohibition.356 The Court in Lawrence expressly overruled Bowers v. Hardwick,357 holding that the “liberty” guarantee in the Substantive Due Process Clause protects the right of an adult to have oral or anal sex with another consenting adult in the privacy of a home.358 Notably, Justice O’Connor relied on equality principles in her concurrence.359 Echoing Lambda Legal’s sentiment from nearly two decades prior, O’Connor explained, “the Texas statute makes homosexuals unequal in the eyes of the law” and “brands all homosexuals as criminals.”360 Just like that, Justice O’Connor conflated conduct with group status.

Individuals can claim a lesbian, gay, or bisexual identity based on same-sex desire alone: sexual conduct is not a requirement for group membership. Accordingly, to conflate sodomy and gay identity is to invoke stereotypes about what it means to be gay that do not match individual realities, which can deny individuals some agency in defining what their bisexual or homosexual identity means to them. Statistically speaking, of course, many LGBTQ individuals are sexually active and do engage in sodomy (defined as any sexual activity involving genital contact with another person’s mouth or anus). A legal prohibition on sodomy thus has the effect of tangibly harming most, but not all, individual LGBTQ people. Further, given the strong cultural associations with sodomy and LGBTQ status, legal prohibitions subordinate LGBTQ people as a group by sending the message that the primary mode of gay sexual expression is inferior to straight sexual expression—and, by extension, that gays are inferior to straights. In the context of articulating a rationale for repealing or striking down a law that prohibits sodomy, conflating bisexual and homosexual status with sodomy does not deny equal dignity. While this conflation does deny some LGBTQ individuals the liberty to form and express their own identities free of state-imposed assumptions about what that identity means, the purpose and effect of this state-imposed assumption are anti-subordinating. Courts and scholars may not always agree on what practices subordinate and when, but acknowledging the practical and cultural importance that sodomy has for many LGBTQ people, for the purpose of decriminalization, does not effectively send a message of queer inferiority. Instead, operationalizing this stereotype in this context has the purpose and effect of dismantling an old social order that denigrated all queer people as worthy of moral condemnation backed by                                                      Determinism: Implications for Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process, 18 U.

This is therefore one example of a constitutionally permissible, and even desirable, use of statistical stereotypes. 2. LGBTQ Affirmative Action Federal and state governments have historically invoked an individual’s non-straight sexual orientation as a basis for negative treatment. In the not-too-distant future, however, public universities and employers could consider lesbian, gay, and bisexual status a positive consideration in admission and hiring decisions.364 The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled that sexual orientation is a suspect or quasi-suspect status, and thus any such action would likely warrant rational basis judicial review.365 Under rational basis review, as Peter Nicolas explains, a state actor that seeks to implement an LGBTQ affirmative action policy “would have an extraordinary amount of flexibility, both with respect to the justifications for establishing such policies and the means employed for accomplishing those goals.”366 Governmental reliance on statistical stereotypes usually poses no Equal Protection problem under mere rational basis review. Even if federal courts ultimately agree that sexual orientation classifications warrant heightened judicial scrutiny, the government should be permitted to rely on some statistical stereotypes in support of affirmative action policies without offending equal dignity principles. From prior Supreme Court cases, we can imagine at least two justifications that a state actor might offer. In a 1986 case, Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education,367 a public school argued that race-based affirmative action in hiring and firing decisions was justified by a compelling interest in providing minority role models to minority students.368 In a 1978 case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the UC Davis Medical School argued that a race-based affirmative action policy in student enrollment was justified by a compelling interest in “increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved.”369                                                      364.

Perhaps it could argue that admitting more gay students relates to an interest in producing more gay professionals who will go on to lift other aspiring gay professionals up the ladder towards success, or who will serve the gay community’s needs. Both Wygant- and Bakke-style justifications arguably reflect statistical stereotypes.371 Not all teachers of color will be good role models for racial minority students, just as not all LGBTQ students will mentor other gay students or even be visible as role models (some may not want to be defined by sexuality or be out on campus). Similarly, not all physicians of color will go on to work in underserved minority communities, and not all gay professionals will specialize in a field important to the LGBTQ community or promote other gay professionals up the employment ladder.                                                      370. If federal courts find that sexual orientation is a suspect classification, the application of strict scrutiny to LGBTQ affirmative action policies likely forecloses the government’s use of justifications similar to the aforementioned rationales offered in Wygant and Bakke. In Wygant, the Supreme Court held the role-model justification to be insufficiently compelling. 476 U.S. at 274–75. In Bakke, the Court found insufficient evidence that the means used—the race-based quota—achieved a compelling interest in “facilitating the health care of its citizens.” 438 U.S. at 310–11. I join the series of scholars who have criticized the Court with respect to those holdings, yet I do not re-litigate the compelling nature of those justifications or the fit between the government’s means and ends here. See, e.g., Adeno Addis, Role Models and the Politics of Recognition, 144 U. PA. L. REV. 1377, 1435–36 (1996) (offering a variety of role model theories, and arguing in favor or a theory that purports to provide examples for emulation and visible affirmations of the presence of racial minority students); Thomas E. Perez, Enhancing Access to Health Care and Eliminating Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Status: A Compelling Case for Health Professional Schools to Implement Race Conscious Admissions Policies, 9 J. HEALTH CARE L. & POL’Y 77, 96–98 (2006) (citing statistical evidence that “race in and of itself is a powerful and better indicator and predictor of service to poor, underserved, and minority communities” than race-neutral factors).  This Article discusses these justifications solely for the sake of argument and under an assumption that one of three hypothetical situations could occur: (1) a more progressive Supreme Court revisits and approves alternative affirmative action justifications in the future; (2) intermediate scrutiny applies to sexual orientation classifications and LGBTQ affirmative action policies require only a substantial relationship to an important governmental interest; or (3) rational basis review applies to sexual orientation classifications and the government is largely free to rely on statistical stereotypes.  371. The Court in Bakke conceded as much: “[i]t may be correct to assume that . . . it is more likely [that minority doctors] will practice in minority communities than the average white doctor.” 438 U.S. at 310–11.  04 - Boso.docx (Do Not Delete) 10/9/2017  9:44 AM 1178 WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW [Vol. 92:1119  However tainted with stereotypes, these rationales for LGBTQ affirmative action programs are anti-subordinating—certainly in purpose, and most likely in effect. The government would send the message that LGBTQ individuals are just as welcome in the marketplace of ideas as straight individuals. Some queer beneficiaries of LGBTQ affirmative action policies would undoubtedly go on to be role models, mentors, and professionals who help others along the way, thus removing barriers to jobs in both the private and public sector. Representation matters. If subordination, defined most simply, is about creating and reinforcing social hierarchies best exemplified by group-based exclusion or relegation to specific roles, the effect here is quite the opposite: to facilitate inclusion and expand opportunities. Moreover, any state-sponsored ascription of meaning to gay identities through the use of these statistical stereotypes is negligible; more individuals than before would have the liberty to craft a gay identity that reflects their career aspirations and talents. A violation of equal dignity requires both group subordination and an unequal denial of individuals’ liberty to express identity. Some would disagree that the effect of affirmative action policies is to remedy rather than perpetuate governmental subordination. To those in this ideological camp, the government’s invocation of suspect and quasi-suspect classifications for even benevolent purposes still sends a subordinating message. Justice Thomas, only the second Black jurist in the Supreme Court’s long history, is famously critical of affirmative action policies precisely because of the message they send. In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,372 Justice Thomas argued that any race-based affirmative action policy “teaches” whites and non-whites alike that racial minorities “cannot compete” without paternalistic help, and that affirmative action policies “stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority.”373 In Grutter v. Bollinger,374 Justice Thomas invoked the specter of equal dignity by arguing, “[e]very time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.”375 This Article acknowledges that jurists and scholars do not agree on what practices subordinate and why. Instead of resolving that question, it seeks to ground a discussion of subordination on a baseline definition                                                      372. 515 U.S. 200 (1995). 373.

Members of every group and subgroup will undoubtedly continue to disagree on subordinating outcomes under even this simplistic analytical prompt. Nevertheless, Justice Stevens’s dissent in Adarand offers a useful gloss on what a governmental policy that disfavors a group and perpetuates hierarchy looks like: “[i]nvidious discrimination is an engine of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group to enhance or maintain the power of the majority.”376 Affirmatively relying on statistical information about a group to facilitate inclusion and expand opportunities for that group should not reasonably be understood to maintain the power of the majority. As Justice Stevens in Adarand went on to note, there is “a difference between a ‘No Trespassing’ sign and a welcome mat.”377 3. LGBTQ Disparate Impact Claims One of the most tantalizing aspects of the Court’s analysis in Obergefell is its willingness to discuss the subordinating impact378 that same-sex marriage bans have on gay people absent any proof that state governments intended to harm gay people.379 Obergefell in fact builds significantly on the kind of impact analysis that United States v. Windsor arguably revived in 2013.380 Since the Court’s much maligned decision381 in Washington v. Davis,382 a basic tenet of constitutional scrutiny is that “a law having a discriminatory impact, but devoid of any facial classification, will be subject only to rational basis review, regardless of the group affected by the discrimination.”383 Discriminatory intent, however, is notoriously                                                      376. 515 U.S. at 243 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  377.

Michael Boucai discusses some theoretical possibilities based on LGBTQ activists’ political rhetoric in the wake of Obergefell: facially neutral policies that make it difficult for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to access assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and adopt children.387 Given the non-traditional methods that many gay, lesbian, and bisexual people might require to become parents, policies that could support an LGBTQ disparate impact claim include: laws that ban surrogacy contracts; laws that permit gametes to be donated but not sold; laws that limit the availability of anonymous sperm donations; and laws that require expensive and invasive screening procedures prior to adoption approvals.388 Other scholars have suggested different possible LGBTQ disparate impact targets regarding public “employee benefits plans tied to marriage.”389 What else? What about statutes criminalizing BDSM                                                      384. The Supreme Court has itself noted this difficulty in Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 224 (1971), where it rejected the argument that “a legislative act may violate equal protection solely because of the motivations of the men who voted for it.” The Court rejected this argument largely due to the difficulty and futility in determining the motivations of a large group of legislators. See Daniel R. Ortiz, The Myth of Intent in Equal Protection, 41 STAN. L. REV. 1105, 1108 (1989).  385. See, e.g., Reva Siegel, Why Equal Protection No Longer Protects: The Evolving Forms of Status-Enforcing State Action, 49 STAN. L. REV. 1111, 1141–42 (1997) (noting the irony of the current heightened scrutiny framework: facially neutral policies that disparately impact women and people of color are largely insulated, but explicit race classifications that benefit people of color in employment and higher education are highly vulnerable under the Court’s evaluative use of strict scrutiny).  386. Professor Laurence H. Tribe makes a similar observation, suggesting in his analysis of Obergefell that it “may well have laid the foundation for reexamining a longstanding but always controversial doctrinal obstacle” in equal protection jurisprudence that requires proof of discriminatory intent.

Some of these claims may offend individual members of the LGBTQ community, particularly when the statistical correlation between conduct and group status is not that strong. All disparate impact claims, however, inherently pose some risk of statistical stereotyping because the challenged policy will not affect every individual group member negatively, and in fact some group members may support the policy or find it personally beneficial. The Supreme Court in a plurality opinion recently acknowledged, to unfortunate effect, the stereotyping risk of disparate impact claims in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action.392 In Schuette, various organizations argued that a popularly enacted amendment to the Michigan Constitution that prohibited affirmative action in public education, employment, and contracting is unlawful race discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.393 The plaintiffs did not raise a disparate impact claim per se, but instead relied on precedent that arguably required courts to “determine and declare which political policies serve the ‘interest’ of a group defined in racial terms.”394 The Court rejected this reading of relevant precedent, explaining that such an inquiry would involve “impermissible racial stereotypes” and specifically the assumption that “members of the same racial group . . . think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.”395 “Were courts to embark upon this                                                      1551–52 (2000); see also A.

But the very nature of group identity means that some groups share certain interests in common and engage in certain conduct more often than other groups. As Russell Robinson argues, “[t]o find that an affirmative action ban has a racial focus and imposes special burdens on racial minorities, one need not conclude that all blacks endorse affirmative action. Surveys have consistently found that a majority of African Americans support affirmative action, and the Court could have simply said that” without implying anything “about the normative question as to whether blacks should support such policies.”397  In other words, the existence of a disparate impact claim does not necessarily define the group for all members. One of the key values supporting disparate impact claims is the belief that facially neutral policies can have the effect of subordinating groups by keeping most individual groups members locked in an oppressive social hierarchy. While taking statistical stereotypes into consideration for disparate impact claims might deny some individuals the absolute liberty of “self-determination and self-conception,” on balance, the conjunctive anti-subordination principle of equal dignity can and should “protect conduct that is widely viewed as group-identified while accepting that some group members may still choose to live differently.”398 CONCLUSION Conventional constitutional wisdom suggests that the government violates the Equal Protection Clause whenever it has the purpose or effect of perpetuating stereotypes, especially those based on race and sex. In recent years, some federal courts have extended the anti-stereotyping doctrine to state actions regarding sexual orientation.399 This conventional wisdom is not entirely correct. For example, some courts permit the government to rely on certain normative and statistical                                                      396. Id. at 1635.  397.

Stereotyping is thus not wrong in and of itself; how the government uses stereotypes should determine whether state action violates the Equal Protection Clause. The Court’s wedding of individual liberty and group equality in Obergefell offers one anchoring theory that helps explain when governmental stereotyping is a constitutional wrong: when it denies equal dignity. Governmental stereotyping denies equal dignity when it has the purpose or effect of subordinating a group by sending a message of group inferiority (most often exemplified by policies that deny a benefit or exclude individuals based on their group status), and when it unequally denies individuals the liberty to form and express their identities. For example, the government should not take adverse actions against individuals—like firing, hiring, or harassing individuals in school or at work—because of its reliance on normative stereotypes about how that individual should behave based on their group identity. Nor should the government deny individuals opportunities to attend the school of their choice or engage in civic functions because of statistical stereotypes about a group’s capabilities, biases, or talents. The government may sometimes take normative and statistical stereotypes into account to prevent individual disparate treatment or wholesale group exclusion from opportunities and civic functions. For example, acknowledging that most Latinos speak Spanish is a permissible use of statistical stereotypes to prevent the government from using Spanish-speaking as a proxy for race and a reason to exclude. As a reason to decriminalize sodomy, acknowledging that most LGBTQ people engage in oral or anal sex is a permissible use of statistical stereotypes because the purpose and effect is to eradicate rather than enforce a formal caste system in which queer but not straight people are criminalized for their sexual conduct. While considering stereotypes like these may affect the meanings of group identity in ways that offend some individual group members, the government’s failure to consider them could result in group subordination. In these and other perhaps counter-intuitive ways, “stereotyping” broadly defined can sometimes promote rather than deny equal dignity. An absolute stereotyping prohibition would exacerbate certain forms of race, sex, and sexual orientation blindness. Groups are important, and the government requires some flexibility to address group-based needs.  ",

    "abstract": "In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court held that same-sex marriage bans violate the Equal Protection Clause for two primary reasons. First, they subordinate; they send the message that lesbians and gays are inferior to heterosexuals. Second, they unequally deny lesbian and gay individuals the liberty to make fundamental decisions about identity and self. These two conjoined themes—anti-group subordination and pro-individual liberty—comprise the two pillars of “equal dignity” that anchor Obergefell’s holding. This Article proposes that these pillars also support the Court’s anti-stereotyping jurisprudence, and equal dignity is thus one important aspect of what the Equal Protection Clause protects. To illustrate: in sex discrimination cases, courts reject state stereotyping when it perpetuates ideas about men’s and women’s roles and reinforces women’s inferior social status; in transgender and sexual orientation discrimination cases, courts have begun to protect LGBTQ individuals from state demands for conformity to normative stereotypes about how to be a man or woman. Protecting individuals’ equal dignity can sometimes become complicated when the reasons for addressing a group’s purported needs elide individual concerns and attachments. For example, the government sometimes relies on normative and statistical information about groups to combat group-associated health and poverty risks, to remedy individual disparate treatment, and to prevent wholesale group exclusion from opportunities and civic duties. Addressing these group-based needs, however, may effectively perpetuate stereotypes about what group membership means. Individual group members may object to the identitarian implications of the government’s help. Not all stereotyping both subordinates a group and denies individuals the liberty to be and express who they are. Accordingly, stereotyping is not wrong in and of itself; how the government uses stereotypes should determine whether state action violates the Equal Protection Clause. Counterintuitively, stereotyping can sometimes promote rather than deny equal dignity. While any state reliance on stereotypes risks essentializing identity, an absolute stereotyping prohibition exacerbates certain forms of race, sex, and sexual orientation blindness. Groups are important, and the government requires some flexibility to address group-based needs",
