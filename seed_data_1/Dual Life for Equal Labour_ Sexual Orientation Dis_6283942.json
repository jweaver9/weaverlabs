Introduction \nDespite worldwide legal protection impetus sexual orientation discrimination does exist in \nemployment. Evidences suggest that the labour market values gay men’s human capital less than that \nof straights. Specifically, gay men have repeatedly claimed that they are fired, not hired, or not \npromoted because of their orientation\n1, while the estimated effects of men’s  †homosexuality† on \nearnings are found to be negative. As it comes to the latter issue, surveys from the United States\n2, the \nUnited Kingdom (Arabsheibani, Mani, and Wadsworth [2004]), and the Netherlands (Plug and \nBerkhout [2004]) document annual earning penalties associated with same-sex sexual behavior for \nmales, still nonetheless, the estimated penalties significantly vary amongst the surveys and conclusions \nchallenged\n3. Yet, the systematic study of sexual orientation minorities has made it valuable for both its \npolicy relevance and its potential to inform social scientists about the functioning of labour market. \nThe current research has taken account of two particular drivers. The first is that no official \ndata and empirical studies exist to investigate gay men’s employment terms in Greece. The second is \nthe significant Eurobarometer’s findings (2007/263), regarding Greeks’ feeling for homosexuality. \nThe survey reveals that the wide majority of Greeks; 0.850 feels that homosexuality is a taboo \ncompared to 0.480 of EU, while the wide majority; 0.840 shares the opinion that it is difficult for gays \nand lesbians to state their sexual orientation at work, compared to 0.680 of EU. Starting from the \nmentioned points the scope of the present study is to unbiased investigate whether gay men are facing \ndiscriminatory practices in the Greek labour market compared to straights, and by thus to evaluate \nwhether stereotypical misconception against gays\n4 prejudice the Greek employers’ screening processes, \ninterestingly three years after the national adoption of the European anti-discrimination employment \nlegislation (2005/3304).  \nIn particular, by means of a Correspondence Test (CT), we first aim to detect sexual orientation \ndiscrimination at the preliminary stage of the selection process, which for gays seems to be a crucial \nbarrier to the labour market. The reason for the latter being is that selection processes are very often \n                                                 \n1 See, Badgett, Donnelly and Kibbe (1992); Palmer (1993); Snape, Thomson and Chetwynd (1995); Mason and Palmer \n(1996); Colvin (2004).  \n2 See, Badgett (1995); Allegretto and Arthur (2001); Berg and Lien (2001); Black, Hoda, Seth, Lower (2003); Blandford \n(2003), Carpenter (2005, 2007). \n3 The annual earning penalties vary between 0.030-0.300, amongst the referential studies generate insignificant and \nsignificant results. The economic explanations of the significant effects include theories of gender nonconformity \n(Blandford [2000]), theories of household specialization (Becker [1991]); Black, Honda, Seth, and Lower [2003]) theories \nof human capital endowments (Berg and Lien [2002]; Becker [1993]) and theories of discrimination (Becker [1957], \nArrow [1972]).   \n4 See, Hoffman (1968); Lundahl and Wadensjo (1984);  Seidman (1994). \n Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n3 \nnot guided by standards, whilst sometimes the standards themselves might lead to the exclusion of \ncertain members of minority groups from obtaining a specific job (Liegl, Perching and Weyss [2004]). \nTo be specific, a typical CT entails that the researcher sends two -equal in human capital- curriculum \nvitaes to each advertised job opening (Riach and Rich [2002]). However, the only characteristic that \ndiffers between the two applicants is their sexual orientations. Following Adam (1981) and \nWeichselbaumer (2003), openly gay worker’s sexual orientation is labelled through a reference in his \ncurriculum vitae to a voluntary work at a homosexual community. The methodology implies that the \nemanated signal is accurate for credibly testing the discrimination hypothesis\n5. Unequal treatments are \nthen measured by the difference in the number of call backs for interview between the two groups\n6. \nCrucially, in the current study we do concentrate on low-skilled groups as they expected to be at more \nrisk for discrimination: Particularly, on non-graduate workers in the private sector (Eurobarometer \n[2003]; [2007]). While we investigate different sectors, that is, on factors that influences variation in \ndiscriminatory behavior across vacancies. \nInterestingly, in the current experiment, taking advantage of the telephone callbacks on the part \nof employers, as well as of the naïve portfolio of the applicants, we have extended the application of \nthe CT technique by also gathering data concerning informal monthly wage offers on the part of \nemployers, in the case of tentative hiring\n7. We argue that this additional data set enables us to further \nrecord discriminatory attitudes across sexual orientations in the ensuing steps of the selection process\n8. \nWhile, by extending the CT methodology we provided unbiased empirical evidence on the equivocally \nrelationship between sexual orientation and earnings. To preview, we find that gay men face a \nsignificant probability to be invited for an interview that is by 0.261 less than that of the straights, and \nan insignificant wage discrimination factor of 0.026 on average. Having controlled for all human \ncapital asymmetries amongst applicants, a taste and/or statistical discrimination imply against gays. In \na process to illuminate the outcomes we further show that persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ \nselection varies: The estimated probability of males to practice occupational access discrimination \nagainst gays is by 0.350 higher than that of females. Furthermore, males are found to practice \ninsignificant wage discrimination of 0.032 against gays, while on the other hand, females are found to \nprovide gays with an insignificant wage premium of 0.006 on average.  \n                                                 \n5 For this methodology see also, Riach and Rich (2002), and the European Handbook on Equality Data (2007). \n6Following, Fix and Struyk (1993), the best evidence about discrimination in labour comes from real life experiments.  \n7 See also Drydakis and Vlassis (2007). \n8Following Adam Barry (1981), we assume that employers by offering an interview are indicative of their willingness to \nconsider applicants employable. Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n4 \nThe current study contributes to two areas that have attracted scarce research attention: the \nexperimental investigation of employment discrimination in Greece, and investigation of \ndiscrimination by sexual orientation. Actually, to the best of our knowledge the current experiment is \nthe first in Europe which deals with gay men labour discrimination and tests persons’ sex responsible \nfor applicants’ selection impact. The experiment offers a purposive analysis of key materials and \nfindings which may be significant in relation to public policy concerns and policy development.  \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we sketch out the European \nanti-discrimination legislation, and we briefly review the theoretical explanations of labour market \ndiscrimination. In the third section we present the model encapsulating the investigating relationships. \nIn the fourth section we describe the methodology and the application structure of the investigation. In \nthe fifth section we present and discuss the field results. In the sixth section we present the results of \nthe second study examining the correlation between persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ selection \nand labour market discrimination against gays. The last section concludes. \n \n2. Dual Life, European Legislation and Theories of Discrimination  \nPsychological and sociological studies suggest that gay men try to avoid discrimination by \nliving a dual life at work (Levine and Leonard [1984]). On the labour market they pass for non gay for \nfear that their employment would be in jeopardy if it became known that they are gay, while outside \nlabour market they come out\n9. Unlike ethnic and racial minorities, the disables and the elderly that are \nvulnerable to discrimination and harassment, gay men may be said to be in the †best position† as they \ncan avoid discrimination by hiding their sexual orientation, regardless the drawbacks (Pharr [1988]; \nByrne [1993]). However, the right to equal opportunity is an important part of the EU’s approach to \nsocial integration. Union’s institutions come to protect gays and lesbians so that they can undergird \ntheir identity in employment. The inclusion of Article 13 in the EC Treaty, following the entry into \nforce of the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty, empowered the Union to deal with discrimination on the range \nof sexual orientation. That development in turn led, in 2000, to the unanimous adoption by the Council \nof the Employment Equality Directive (2000/78), aiming to ensure that everybody living in the EU can \nbenefit from effective legal protection against sexual orientation discrimination. Greece, for instance, \n                                                 \n9 Following Herek (1990), homosexuality pervades societal customs like institutional racism and sexism. It operates \nthrough a dual process of invisibility and attack. It usually remains culturally invisible; when people who engage in \nhomosexual behaviour or who are identified as homosexual become visible they are subject to attack by society. Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n5 \nby adopting the European Legislation in January 2005\n10 (2005/3304), made sexual orientation \ndiscrimination a legally prohibited act in the labour market\n11. \nAs regards the theoretical explanations of labour market discrimination, these are concerned \nwith how and why productively irrelevant characteristics influence the labour market behavior of \nemployers and workers (Swinton [1977]). There is not, however, a generally accepted theory \nexplaining labour market discrimination, while there have been a variety of hypotheses for that. The \ntwo mainstream ones are briefly as follows. The taste hypothesis (Becker [1957]; [1971]) envisions \ndiscrimination as a preference or taste for which the discriminator is willing to pay. In particular, the \ntaste for discrimination on the part of employers is based on the idea that they want to maintain a \nphysical or social distance from certain groups, or they may fear that their customers or co-workers \ndislike transacting with minorities i.e. gays. Generally, those groups are socialized so as to perceive \nminorities as inferior and unreliable. However, the wage of the minority applicant would have to \nfollow below the wage of majority applicant before the employers would be willing to overcome their \ndislike and hire them. As a result, the demand for minority workers is ceteris paribus lowered, \ndepressing their relative wages, while the size of the  †minority penalty† is directly related to the \nstrength of the employers’ distaste.  Yet, the trouble with this postulate is that it explicitly contradicts \nthe regular view of employers as being profit maximizers.  \nOn the other hand, the idea that competition may eventually eliminate inefficient \ndiscrimination led to the development of the statistical discrimination hypothesis (Arrow [1972]; \n[1973]; Phelps [1972]; Aigner and Clain [1977]). Discrimination results from the profit maximizing \nresponse of employers to uncertainty about the quality of individual workers, while the real or \nsubjective distributions favour the group which receives preferences i.e. straights. Statistical models of \ndiscrimination predict that if employers perceive minorities as being generally less productive than \nmajorities, and if it is difficult to measure the actual workers’ productivity, then minorities with above-\n                                                 \n10In particular, the #2005/3004 applies to a range of grounds, including racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age, \ndisability and sexual orientation (regarding both the public and private sectors), in relation to: (a) Conditions for access to \nemployment, to self-employment and to occupation, selection criteria and recruitment conditions, whatever is the branch of \nactivity and the level of the professional hierarchy (including promotion). (b) Access to all types and to all levels of \nvocational guidance, vocational training, advanced vocational training and retraining, including practical work experience. \n(c) Employment and working conditions, including dismissals and pay, (d) Membership of and involvement in an \norganization of workers or employers, or any organization whose members carry on a particular profession, including the \nbenefits provided for by such organizations, (e) Social protection, including social security and health care, (f) Social \nadvantages, (g) Education, (h) Access to the supply of goods and services which are available to the public (including \nhousing).   \n11 Instructive, civil marriage between same sex people does not exist in Greece.   Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n6 \naverage productivity may receive below-average returns. If this is the case, a price markup and/or \nexclusionary tactics are asked so as to compensate for lower expected profit and/or higher risk.   \nHowever, any or a combination, of the above explanations can be validated by the CT results \nthat follow. Any theory of the cause of discrimination make predictions about the circumstances under \ndiscrimination will occur, and CT’s data make it possible to determine which predictions are supported \nby employers’ behavior\n12 . More importantly, those results can significantly contribute to our \nperception about what may amongst else affect the opportunities of certain minority groups to access \noccupations and thus uncover well concealed discrimination which is hard to detect by other means. \nAt the same time, the potential of directly collecting discrimination data may further support anti-\ndiscrimination policies, since these policies can only be as good as the information on which they are \nbased\n13.  \n \n3. The Model \nThe above practices imply that discrimination in the Greek labour market may take various \nforms and be related with the candidate employees’ -other than productivity- characteristics. \nStemming from that, in this paper we particularly examine whether sexual orientation affects: First, \nthe probability (PCB) of an applicant to receive a call-back for a job interview. Second, the monthly \nwage offer ( W CB) on the part of the applicant’s (tentative) employer. We respectively specify the \nfollowing estimable relationships. \nPCB(callback=1) = α1 + β1  sexual orientation + u1                                                               (1) \nWCB = α2 + β2  sexual orientation + u2                                                                                             (2)                                                \nBy construction of this CT (see, amongst else, Neumark, Bank and Van Nort [1996]; Bertrand \nand Mullainathan [2004]), all applicants have to be matched in all characteristics (e.g. age, human \ncapital, marital status, masculinity etc) other than sexual orientation; sexual orientation takes the value \nof 1 (0) if the candidate is straight (gay) and its impact is measured by the 1 b , and  2 b  coefficients. \nMoreover, having controlled for same but sexual orientation characteristics across the two applicants, \n                                                 \n12 Taste and/or statistical hypothesis of discrimination against gay men can be crystallized in the terms: Homophobia, \nHeterosexism and Sexual Prejudice. Following, Weinberg (1972) homophobia is used to label heterosexuals' dread of \nbeing in close quarters with homosexuals as well as homosexuals' self loathing. In general, distastes and phobia focus on \nhomosexual peoples’ behaviour, lifestyle and culture. Heterosexism is used as a term analogous to sexism and racism, \ndescribing an ideological system that denies, denigrates, and stigmatizes any nonheterosexual form of behaviour, identity, \nrelationship, or community (Herek [1990]). The term highlights the parallels between antigay sentiment and other forms of \nprejudice, such as racism, anti-Semitism, and sexism. While, sexual prejudice refers to all negative attitudes based on \nsexual orientation, whether the target is homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. The prejudice is almost always directed at \npeople who engage in homosexual behaviour or label themselves gay, lesbian, or bisexual (Herek [2000]). \n13 See European Handbook on Equality Data (2006). Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n7 \nthe latter is not expected to be correlated with the error term in each equation. As in particular regards \nthe second relationship; wage offers are of course observed only if an applicant receives a call-back. \nStill, nonetheless, there has been no form of omitted variables which may have bias those offers; the \nsame independent variable, i.e. sexual orientation, presumably influences call-backs as well as \ninformal wage offers. Hence, as well no correlation should be expected amongst error terms across the \ntwo equations (see, e.g., Green [2003]; Sartori [2003]; Heckman [1990])\n14.  \nWhat does really matter in the field experiment, nonetheless, is the intra-class correlation \namong the dependent variables (see, e.g., Bertrand and Mullainathan [2004]). Regarding the first \nrelationship, two curriculum vitaes were sent to the same firm; hence the probability of the straight \n(gay) applicant to receive a call-back is rather correlated with the probability of the gay (straight) \napplicant to receive one. Similarly, in the second relationship, firms’ wage offers to the straight (gay) \napplicant are expected to be correlated with their offers to the gay (straight) applicant. Thus, in order \nto correctly analyze the data those correlations are needed to be taken into account. If not, the standard \nerrors would be underestimated, rendering invalidity to our significance tests\n15.  In the estimations that \nfollow full information-adjusted standard errors are therefore reported\n16.   \n \n4. Methodology and Application Structure  \nDescending the seminal paper of Riach and Rich (2002) different forms of field experiments \nhave been used to test for discrimination in hiring\n17 . Due to their controllability and the unequivocal \nmeasurement which they entail\n18 these real-life experiments have become quite popular and they have \nbeen carried out in at least fifteen countries/states\n19.  \n                                                 \n14 Note, that Heckman selection models (ML, Two Steps) are not appropriate, as both equations include only the same \nindependent variable: sexual orientation.  \n15 The intra-class correlation is a measure of variation between and within clusters of individuals (see, e.g., Fleiss, Levin \nand Paik [2003]).  Specifically, the within-cluster correlation will affect the power of a trial, because a greater homogeneity \nof cluster members will increase the standard error of the estimate of the treatment effect. This results into a loss of power \nto detect a difference between the intervention and control groups.   \n16 See, Stata Library: Analyzing Correlated Clustered Data. \n17 There are two other procedures that had been previously used to measure discrimination in the labour market. These \nmethods involve personal approaches, in which individuals either apply over telephone (Brown and Gay [1985]; Hubbuck \nand Carter [1980]) or they attend job interviews (Daniel [1968]; McIntosh and Smith [1974]). \n18 CT can only be effective in demonstrating discrimination at the initial stage of a selection process, as well as in \nmeasuring the results of the selection process (see Bertrand and Mullainathan [2004]). However, in our context, one cares \nabout whether a candidate will eventually get a job, as well as about the wage offered conditional on getting the job. Whilst, \nin real life, job and wage offerings are also obtained via informal search and networks (see Allosino, Reyneri, Venturini \nand Zincone [2004]; Olli Segendorf and Rooth [2006]).  \n19 In Europe such experiments have been carried out in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Denmark, England, France, Italy, \nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands; as well as in Australia and the U.S.   Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n8 \nOur experiment was conducted between December 2006 to September 2007 and involved the \ncapital of Greece, Athens. In order to measure occupational access discrimination for gays, we had \nfabricated two imaginary, equal in human-capital workers/testers, applying to the same job by sending \ncurriculum vitaes using different fax devices. The occupations, to which we have been focused on, \ncovered a large spectrum of job quality: office jobs, industry jobs, café and restaurant services and \nshop sales. These occupations have been chosen because, while there as well have been many low \nskilled vacancies in agriculture, construction, cleaning, and delivery, in most of the latter cases only \ntelephone contact was available. Interestingly, however, the investigated occupations allowed for \nfurther classification in accordance to the nature of the research. It is rather obvious that a key issue \nthat arise when low skilled gay applicants seek for a job is the visibility and invisibility of equality, \ntolerance and diversity in relation to their sexual orientation in sectors.  Though industry vacancies as \nthe masculine jobs, café-restaurant services and sales vacancies as the gay friendly jobs while office \nvacancies as the most status jobs, regarding the sample, we had a further dimension to take into \naccount\n20.  \nNext, we applied to vacancies where there was demand for eight-hour and five-day \nemployment. These vacancies were identified through a random sample of advertisements, appearing \nin website newspapers, and as we have already mentioned we concentrated on low-skilled groups as \nthey expected to be at more risk for discrimination. The curriculum vitaes were faxed simultaneously, \nwithin one day of the advertisement appearance, and if firms were interested about any of the \napplicants they could be reached either through an available postal address\n21, or by telephone contact. \nThe qualifications and the presentation style of our two fictitious applicants were matched as closely \nas possible, so that they were identical in all employment relevant characteristics but sexual orientation. \nWhile, each application was designed so as to equally convey the type of experience that might make \nan applicant attractive. Each of our fictitious applicants/testers was allocated a male Greek distinctive \nfirst and last name, a mobile telephone number, and a postal address. The addresses were chosen so \nthat to be recognized as similar as possible, in order to indicate the same social class. Applications \nshowed the same level of schooling and job experience. Both candidates had finished high schools, \napproximately twelve years ago (Appendix 1). Furthermore, the applicants were 29 years old, \nunmarried, and had carried out military service in different areas\n22. Both candidates had nine years of \n                                                 \n20 See, Colgan, Greegan, McKearney and Wright (2006). \n21 However, no firm responded in a written way. \n22 In Greece, having carried out the military service typically boosts a male’s probability of being hired. Thus, in order our \ntwo candidates to be as equal as it is possible, we had to consider this crucial factor too.  Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n9 \nwork experience in a similar post to each vacancy applying for, while, to avoid detection, the \ncandidates’ high schools and previous workplaces were located at different areas in Athens. Moreover, \nboth applicants had similar hobbies and personal characteristics entailed similar masculinity\n23. \nHowever, the two applicants were identical apart from their sexual orientation. The gay’s \napplication was denoted by a reference in the personal information part, of the line †member volunteer \nin the Athenian Homosexual Community†. To control the probability that the activity may create \nholdbacks in his present duties it had ended. Also, in case that †activism† might bias the selection \nprocess, the straight’s curriculum vitae mentioned a past volunteerism in an environmental community \ntoo. For obvious reasons, the styles of the curriculum vitaes and cover letters were different for each \npair. Yet, in order to control for the possibility the style of an application to influence an employer’s \nresponse, those two -different in style- application forms were equally allocated between the straight \nand gay applicants. For the same reason, applications were sent alternately to each vacancy; in half \ncases the straight (the gay) application was first sent. Both experimental controls adjusted in the \nregression stage\n24. \nFollowing, whenever firms called for arranging appointments with the applicants the two \ntesters were trying to raise informal questions, concerning monthly wage offers. To verify that the \ntesters were identical to all  †observed†, in the telephone contact, characteristics e.g. accent\n25, \nmasculinity, articulation, age and mansuetude, and that they were also responding equally, either to \nemployers’ clarifications or to their own questions, we had conducted pre-tests: Having recorded a \ntesters’ pilot rehearsal, considerable numbers of individuals were asked to confirm the relevant issues. \nOur true experiment then began only after a unanimous advocacy had been reached. On the other hand, \nhowever, we must note that it is off course impossible to test a firm’s truthfulness, until a candidate is \nactually hired. \n \n5. Field Results \nHaving completed field-data collection\n26 we subsequently evaluated the effects of  sexual \norientation by estimating equations (1) and (2), using the entire data set, as well as separately for each \n                                                 \n23 Gay men who violate genders rules face considerable prejudice as their mannerism is inconsistent with society’s \nexpectations about masculinity (Levine [1998]; Herek [2004]). \n24 For an extensive study on control variables and random events see Fix and Struyk (1993).   \n25 Both testers have been chosen to have a masculine accent entailed similar gender. The researcher is quite concerned that \nthe level of wage discrimination might be greater against the gay applicant with womanish accent.    \n26 Descriptive statistics are reported in the Appendix 2.1.

Though, heterogeneity amongst \nsectors, the probability varies across them: In office jobs gay men face 0.304 less probability to be \ninvited for interview, followed by 0.289 in shop sales, 0.248 in industries, and 0.211 in restaurants and \ncafé services. The findings provide significant evidence that, of the two identical applicants engaging \nin an identical job search, the gay would receive fewer interview callbacks. It implied that gay men \nrelative to straights have to spend more time, effort, and resources, for an interview, as the same \nobservable signal is more precise for straights than gays. Therefore, on the part of employers taste \nand/or statistical discrimination is implied against gays.  \nMentionable, although applicants by construction appeared to be similar, they do look different \nto employers. The findings reveal differences among the two counter pairs, across sectors, while at the \nsame time suggest that, no matter the status of the vacancies, discrimination is well founded, with the \nstraight applicants always having advantages: In all low-skill occupations the gay applicant is found to \nface significant constraints in the selection process. Nonetheless, naturally considering office jobs \nbeing a higher-status sector, the findings reveal that in these vacancies gay applicants face the higher \noccupational access constraints. Interestingly and parallel to the above analysis, gay applicants do not \nseem to enjoy a significant access premium in the gay-friendly occupations. Regardless norm ordains; \n“unskilled young gays to be dovetailed and segregated in sales and café-restaurant services”, the \nestimations can not countersign the fact. Actually, in industries the gay applicants face a less \ndiscrimination factor than that in shop sales. \nMoreover, we have re-estimated equation (1) including (adjusted) two binary controls variables: \nCurriculum vitaes’ sending order and type style, still nonetheless their impact on the relevant outcome \nis negligible (see, Appendix 3, Table 3.1). The coefficients estimations indicate statistically significant \nless probability for the gay labelled applicant to be invited for interview of about 0.211-0.303, Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n11 \namongst the four sectors. Since experimental conditions are equally assigned, these controls do not \nsubstantially affect the estimated effect of sexual orientation, but they make the estimate more precise. \nTurning next to equation (2), Table 2, the estimations entail that the gay labelled applicants \nface a monthly  †sexual orientation penalty† of 18.33€, producing a wage discrimination \nfactor\n27d=0.026, which is a statistically insignificant outcome on average. Separately in each sector we \nfound similarly insignificant small effects. The higher penalty is found in shop sales (14.97€ \n[d=0.023]), followed by office jobs (8.77€ [d=0.011]), restaurant and café services (6.07€ [d=0.009]), \nand industries (2.91€ [d=0.003]).  \n \nTable 2: OLS : Coefficient Estimations & Marginal Effects; Independent Variable : Sexual Orientation \nOccupations \n \nCoefficient \nOffice Jobs  Industries  Restaurant and Café \nServices \nShop \nSales \nTotal \n \nβ2 \ns.e \np-values \nObservations \n \n-8.770    me -0.011 \n(19.774) \n0.663 \n-125- \n \n-2.916    me -0.003 \n(16.487) \n0.862 \n-90- \n \n-6.078    me -0.009 \n(13.478) \n0.657 \n-106- \n \n-14.976  me -0.023 \n(11.609) \n0.212 \n-155- \n \n-18.330  me -0.026 \n(10.409) \n0.120 \n-476- \nNotes: Standard errors (s.e) are adjusted for intra-class correlation. Statistically Significant at 1 %(*); 5 %(**).  \n \n \nIn all sectors the wage differentials of this magnitude represents an insignificant loss in gay’s welfare. \nAs it comes, the lower relative to straights, accessibility of gays to the reference occupations entails \ndiscriminatory but statistically insignificant effects in the ensuing steps of the selection process. \nAlthough, the implied penalty required for adequate compensation it is not high enough as to arouse \nthe suspicion of the prospective seekers, it seems that employers may consider gays as being less \nproductive than straights, hence, the former would have to suffer the monthly sexual orientation \npenalty, whenever employed; and/or employers might be willing to overcome a taste against gays if \ntheir wages fall bellow those of straights. Interestingly, the estimations indicate that in industries the \ndiscrimination factor get its lower value, compared to others. Partially, it implied that masculinity does \nnot fight it out gays’ welfare.  However, someone could further claim that in industries as well as in \noffice jobs wages are rather fixed, mainly on payroll criteria, and thus they can not be extensively \nfluctuated depending on irrelevant to human capital endowments\n28.     \nFor a deeper investigation, we have re-estimated equation (2) limited the sample only to those \ncases where both applicants/testers received a wage offer (Appendix 3, Table 3.2, Panel A). The \ncoefficients estimations indicate a less insignificant income disadvantage of about; 0.008-0.019, \n                                                 \n27 This factor d typically measures the strength of the firms’ bias regarding –informal- wage offers, i.e., the % by which the \nwage of the gay applicant would have to fall below the wage of the straight before firms are prepared to consider both as \nequally employable.  So,d corresponds to marginal effect.  \n28 See, Colgan, Greegan, McKearney and Wright (2006). Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n12 \ngenerating a wage discrimination factor of 0.015, against gays on average. Similarly, in shop sales the \nwage discrimination factor gets the higher value while in office jobs it gets the lower value. \nFurthermore, including to the latter regression a binary variable: Firms’ callbacks order, its impact is \nfound to be negligible (Appendix 3, Table 3.2, Panel B). Thus, whether firms had contacted the \nstraight (gay) applicant first (second) it is rather oblivious to the wages offers.    \n \n6. Discussion: Sex and Discrimination  \nHaving estimated a significant degree of occupational access discrimination against gays we \nwere interested also in investigating whether persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ selection could \ndetermine discriminatory attitudes. Following, Kimmel (1994) and Kimmel and Mahler (2003), sexual \norientation discrimination is not evenly distributed throughout society, but is more or less pronounced \naccording to demographic characteristics. An sizeable amount of empirical surveys show individuals’ \nattitudes toward gay men to be consistently correlated with sex (Yang [1997]; Davis, Yarber, \nBauserman, Schreer and Davis [1998]).  \nTo attempt to assess the role of these, in the current experiment whenever firms had call \nbacked applicants in order to arrange an appointment the testers gathered specifically information \nconcerning interlocutors’ status. The methodology enabled: To effectively identify those persons i.e., \nemployers and managers, who were responsible for the applicants’ selection, and effectively to register \ntheir sex. Persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ selection impact on gay’s\n29 terms of employment is \nsummarized in Table 3 and 4, below. \nTable 3: Probit: Marginal Effects; Independent Variable: Persons’ Sex Responsible for Applicants’ Selection \nOccupations \n \nCoefficient \nOffice Jobs  Industries  Restaurant and Café \nServices \nShop \nSales \nTotal \n \nβSo \ns.e. \np-values \nObservations \n \n-0.356 \n(0.104) \n0.000* \n-187- \n \n-0.290 \n(0.222) \n0.195 \n-131- \n \n-0.289 \n(0.175) \n0.108 \n-169- \n \n-0.393 \n(0.087) \n0.000* \n-209- \n \n-0.350 \n(0.061) \n0.000* \n-696- \nNotes: The dependent binary variable is total invitations-discriminations for the gay applicant.

Statistically Significant at 1 %(*), 5 %(**).  \n .  \nTable 3, reveals significant results that can not be underestimated. On average, gays’ \noccupational access significantly varies depending on persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ \n                                                 \n29 Notice that discriminatory treatments against the straight applicants are generally attributed to random events. Following, \nWienk, Clifford, Simonson and Eggers (1979) the share of calls in which a minority applicant is favored provides an \nestimate of the extent to which random factors are at work. In our case the occupational access discrimination against the \nstraight applicant was a negligibly outcome; 0.005, which made unable to test for any correlation between persons’ sex \nresponsible for applicants’ selection and the relevant discrimination (see, Myers [1990]). Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n13 \nselection. The estimated probability of males to discriminate against gays is by 0.350 higher than that \nof females on average\n30. Analytically, in shop sales the estimated probability of males to discriminate \nagainst gays is by 0.393 higher than that of females, while in office jobs is also higher by 0.356. In \nindustries and café-restaurant vacancies, however, persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ selection \ninsignificantly stands\n31. Moreover, as Table 4 shows, males practice insignificant sexual orientations \npenalties of 22.13€ [0.032] against gay labelled applicants, Panel A, while females provide them with \nan insignificant wage premium of 4.52€ [0.006], Panel B, on average.  \n \nTable 4 OLS : Coefficient Estimations & Marginal Effects; Independent Variable: Persons’ Sex Responsible for Applicants’ Selection \nOccupations \n \nCoefficient \nOffice Jobs  Industries  Restaurant and Café \nServices \nShop  \nSales \nTotal \nPanel A: male \nβSpm \ns.e. \np-values \nObservations \n \n-13.570  me -0.018 \n(23.638) \n0.574 \n-100- \n \n-2.947  me -0.004   \n(12.238) \n0.813 \n-83- \n \n-3.411  me -0.005 \n(13.380) \n0.802 \n-98- \n \n-21.087  me -0.003 \n(10.855) \n0.067 \n-122- \n \n-22.139  me -0.032 \n(11.071) \n0.056 \n-403- \nPanel B: female \nβSpf \ns.e. \np-values \nObservations \n \n5.147    me 0.006   \n(21.781) \n0.818 \n-25- \n \n-14.000  me -0.021   \n(61.442) \n0.813 \n-7- \n \n-28.333  me -0.044 \n(64.652) \n0.679 \n-8- \n \n7.652    me 0.011 \n(16.686) \n0.657 \n-33- \n \n4.527   me 0.006 \n(18.503) \n0.810 \n-73- \nNotes:In Panel A, the dependent variable is  males’ wage offers.

On the other hand, if \npersons responsible for applicants’ selection are females; an insignificant wage premium for gays is \nidentified in shop sales of 7.65€ [0.011] and in offices of 5.14€ [0.006]. However, in restaurant-café \nservices a sexual orientation penalty for gays implied which is higher by 28.33€ [0.044], followed by \n14.00€ [0.021] in industries\n32. \n                                                 \n30 Notice, that in those cases where the gay applicant was invited for interview, persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ \nselection was assigned by the relevant tester. Meanwhile, in those cases where the gay was discriminated, persons’ sex \nresponsible for applicants’ selection was effectively assigned by the straight tester.  \n31 In these vacancies the representation of female employers was scarce restricted volatility. \n32 Furthermore, we have re-estimated the relation limited the sample only to those cases where both applicants/testers \nreceived a wage offer (see, Appendix 3, Table 3.2, Panel A&B). On average, as Panel A and B show, male and female \npersons responsible for applicants’ selection practice insignificant sexual orientations penalties against gays of 13.97€ \n[0.021], and of 2.27€ [0.003], respectively.  As it comes, if persons responsible for applicants selection are males, the \nsexual orientation penalty against gays is of 14.21€ [0.021] in restaurant-café services, followed by 14.05€ [0.003] in shop \nsales, by 10.62 € [0.015] in industries, and by 10.00€ [0.013] in offices (Panel A). Consequently, the estimations indicate a \nless insignificant income disadvantage. On the other hand, if persons responsible for applicants selection are females, the \nsexual orientation penalty against gays is of 15.00€ [0.024] in restaurant-café services, followed by 5.00€ [0.007] in shop \nsales, while in industries and in offices no penalty exists (Panel B). Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n14 \nUtilized persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ selection, there are some patterns in the results \nwhich provide some interesting insights. It seems that males are more reluctant in their reactions to \nhomosexuality as they are significantly more prone to practice higher occupational access \ndiscrimination than females (see, Kitien and Whitley [1998]). Yet, following Herek (1986), males’ \nrelationship between homophobia and masculinity is evident in the first place in their relatively \nstronger allegiance to homophobic attitudes. Indeed, males include stronger beliefs than females about \ngenders, morality, and danger by which men homosexuality is defined as  †inferior† which \npredetermine their attitudes (see e.g., Davis, Yarber, Bauserman, Schreer and Davis [1998]). Actually, \nthe estimations indicate that males do inflict higher sexual orientation penalties to overcome their \ndislikes and/or uncertainty for gay labelled applicants.  \nHowever, we must keep in mind that a complete understanding of gay men discrimination \nrequires analysis of its roots in culture and social interactions, as well as individual thought processes. \nDefinitely, people’s attitudes are formed on the basis of personal experiences, beliefs norms and \nstandards as well as on actual contextual events\n33 (Herek [1992], [2004]; Pharr [1998]).  \n \n7. Conclusions  \nIn 2000 the European Union had instituted specific legislation aiming to lay down a framework \nfor combating discrimination in the labour market. Briefly, that legislation made clear that people \naffected by discrimination should have adequate means of legal protection against unequal treatments, \nand an effective right of redress. It proves, however, that a history of discrimination cannot turn \novernight. This study is the first in Greece using a Correspondence Test to examine whether sexual \norientation discrimination against gay men exists in the Greek labour market.  \nFocus on the selection process our results reveal significant sexual orientation differences in \naccess to occupations, and insignificant in wage offers. Gay men relative to straights have to spend \nmore effort, and resources, for an interview, as the same observable signal is more precise for straights \nthan gays. In particular, the estimated probability of gays to receive an interview invitation is found to \nbe by 0.261 lower than that of the straights, while the wage discrimination factor is estimated to be \n0.026 for gays. The estimations suggest that it is required a willingness to spend amounts of time job-\n                                                 \n33 Although CT can not measure other than occupational access and wage discrimination against gay applicants; during the \nexperiment we became ourselves victims of abuses and bulling. After a short period of CVs sending the gay applicant’s-\ntester’s mobile started to receive intimidating calls (from males) and sms regarding his sexual orientation, which lasted up \nto the end of the experiment. Although we can not identified whether the calls came from employers, managers or other \nemployees, or whether the gay labelled applicant have been rejected or called for interview, the experience came to \nilluminate some further discriminatory incidents which might face an openly gay in the workplace.    Working Paper Series 2007 \n \n \n15 \nhunting if men are openly gay, while the wage differentials of this magnitude would represent an \ninsignificant loss in gay’s welfare. Last but not least, in a process to illuminate the outcomes, we \nfurther find that persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ selection significantly varies; the estimated \nprobability of males to practice occupational access discrimination against gays is by 0.350 higher \nthan that of female. Furthermore, males are found to practice insignificant wage discrimination of \n0.032 against gays, while female are found to provide gays with an insignificant wage premium of \n0.006 on average.  \n \nReference  \nAdam, B.

    "abstract": "By means of a real-life experiment we investigated employment discrimination against low skilled gay men in the Greek private labour market three years after the national adoption of the European anti-discrimination employment legislation. As it first regards occupational access, curriculum vitaes differed only in sexual orientation were faxed to advertised job openings. The estimated probability of gays to receive an interview was by 0.261 lower than that of straights. In addition, exploiting the informal wage offers on the part of tentative employers, a wage discrimination factor was found to be 0.026 for gays. As it comes, a taste and/or statistical discrimination implied against gays. Adjusted for intra-class correlation the estimated differentials were found to be statistically significant (insignificant) for the first (second) measurement. In a process to understand the nature of the discrimination we further found that persons’ sex responsible for applicants’ selection significantly varied; the estimated probability of males to practice occupational access discrimination against gays was by 0.350 higher than that of female. Moreover, males were found to practice insignificant wage discrimination of 0.032 against gays, while female were found to provide gays with an insignificant wage premium of 0.006 on average. The current research contributes to the small academic literature on the economics of discrimination according to sexual orientation in Europe.Field Experiment, Sexual Preference, Hiring Discrimination, Wage Discrimination",
