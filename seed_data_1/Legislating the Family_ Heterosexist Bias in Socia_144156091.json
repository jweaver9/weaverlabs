It discusses the Personal Responsibilityand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), the Defense ofMarriage Act (DOMA), federal definitions of family and household, andstereotypes about LGBT individuals. It argues that poor LGBT individualsand families lack full citizen rights and access to needed social services asa result of these explicit and implicit biases.Key words: Welfare reform; family policy; civil rights; gay, lesbian,bisexual and transgender (LGBT); heterosexismWelfare reform is fundamentally about family policy-about pro-moting and privileging particular kinds of families, and about pe-nalizing and stigmatizing others. (Cahill and Jones 2002: 1).Two pieces of legislation were passed in 1996 that set animportant tone for family policy in the United States: The 1996Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity ReconciliationAct (PRWORA), an act that expanded welfare-to-work programsthroughout the country, restricted people's access to public assis-tance, and crystallized the broader restructuring of public-privateboundaries; and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), whichdefines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman. Atfirst glance, the two initiatives appear unrelated and inconsequen-tial, although the reality is quite different. Combined, they con-stitute a national policy context within which legal and culturalJournal of Sociology and Social Welfare, December, 2004, Volume XXXI, Number 422 Journal of Sociology & Social Welfaredefinitions of \"the family\" have been restricted and where lesbian,gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights legislation hasbeen blocked or challenged, both on moral and legal grounds.Although some important victories have been made by LGBTcivil rights activists, heterosexist biases in federal law and policycontinue to have negative effects for LGBT communities. PoorLGBT individuals and families, in particular, suffer consequencesfrom these policy decisions because they do not have full citizenrights nor, in many cases, can they access needed resources.This article addresses the effects of heterosexist bias in socialwelfare policy frameworks on LGBT individuals and families. Itbrings together three often-disconnected arenas of public policy:social welfare, family, and LGBT civil rights. Although contempo-rary scholarship on social welfare and family policy have put intoquestion the \"nuclear family\" as the basis for policy (Haney andPollard eds. 2003), and rightly so, few studies have addressed therole that institutionalized heterosexuality itself plays in shapingand powerfully influencing social welfare agendas. While manyscholars have addressed the gendered and racialized dimensionsof social welfare frameworks, including how racism and sex-ism provide foundations for restricting people's access to much-needed forms of assistance and to their civil rights, few haveaddressed how heterosexism, too, works to restrict access andlimit citizenship for individuals who do not fit within sexual andgender norms (Phelan 2001; on racism and sexism, see Gordoned. 1990; Gordon 1994; Gordon and Fraser 1994; Mink 1990; Minked. 1999; Naples 1998; Moller 2002). Even fewer have addressedthe ways in which gender identity discrimination intersects withheterosexism to affect the lives of transgendered as well as non-transgendered lesbians, gays, bisexuals and heterosexuals. Andthe few researchers and policy-makers who have made importantcontributions to \"queering,\" or examining the heterosexist biasesin, American social policy, have yet to be taken seriously withinmainstream policy circles (Butler 1990; Sedgwick 1992; Cahill andJones 2002). In fact, policy struggles over the meaning of familyand attacks on LGBT communities and civil rights have gonehand-in-hand: \"It is no accident that the Personal Responsibilityand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), and theDefense of Marriage Act (DOMA) were passed and signed intoLegislating the Family 23law within days of each other,\" as Sean Cahill and Kenneth T.Jones observe (2002: 15). In these ways, institutionalized hetero-sexuality is central to some of the key motivation(s) behind anddesign of public policy frameworks in the United States.By \"institutionalized heterosexuality\" I am referring to the setof ideas, institutions and relationships that make the heterosexualfamily the societal norm, while rendering homosexual/queerfamilies \"abnormal\" or \"deviant\" (Ingraham 1999). My queeranalysis of social welfare involves examining how sexuality andgender can be rethought and reorganized in economic and socialpolicy frameworks, theories and practices. Throughout the articleI examine how heterosexuality is assumed to be the natural basisfor defining the family, and by extension, society, both explicitly(by excluding LGBT people from the analysis and by stigmatizingcertain individuals as \"non-family\" or \"anti-family\") and implic-itly (by assuming that all people are heterosexual, that marriage isa given and exists only between a traditionally-defined man andwoman, and that all people fit more or less into traditional genderroles; see Foucault 1978; Fraser and Gordon 1994; Ingraham 1999;Phelan 2001; Bernstein and Reimann eds. 2001; Mink ed. 1999;Cahill et al. 2002).Historical Background: Sexuality and Public PolicyHomosexuality has been historically regulated and disci-plined through various policies, laws, and institutions in the U.S.(Foucault 1978; Calhoun 2000; Bernstein and Reimann eds. 2001).Until now, gays, lesbians and bisexuals in a limited amount ofstates or municipalities have enjoyed certain heterosexual priv-ileges, such as health or insurance benefits, the right to adoptor have children, the right to work in a discrimination-free en-vironment, and the right to \"marry\" (e.g., Massachusetts, do-mestic partner laws in Vermont, California, and over 65 cities).These legal and political achievements have been obtained at themunicipal or state levels rather than through federal legislation,thus extending rights to LGBT communities in a fragmentedway. In addition, many of these policies and laws are laden withcontradictions. Vermont's Domestic Partner Laws, for example,are set up as a parallel system to marriage laws, thus creating24 Journal of Sociology & Social Welfarea \"separate but equal\" context reminiscent of earlier civil rightslegislation and leaving the heterosexist institution of marriageintact and largely unchallenged. The federal \"Don't Ask, Don'tTell\" policy, signed by President Bill Clinton (1992-2000) in 1993and implemented in 1994, is contradictory because althoughPresident Clinton authorized the policy as a way to \"protect\"gays in the military (as long as they remain in the closet), thereality is that more gays have been expelled from the militarysince 1994 than ever before (SLDN 1999), including during theexplicit government campaign to expel homosexuals from themilitary during World War II (Berub6 1990).Importantly, LGBT people have actively challenged and nego-tiated discriminatory legislation with some success. Anti-sodomylaws, which legally prohibit consensual, same-sex sexual relation-ships (sometimes for women too), have been repealed, althoughthirteen states upheld these archaic laws until the landmark deci-sion by the Supreme Court to overturn them in June 2003 (NGLTF2004a and b). Non-discrimination clauses have been passed bysome states and dozens of municipalities, providing protectionfor citizens regardless of their sexual orientation and in somecases, their gender identity/expression (TLPI 2004). In addition,many private companies and public institutions (e.g., univer-sities) have added non-discrimination clauses to their code ofethics or by-laws. The State of Connecticut is currently reviewingproposed legislation for same-sex marriage, following the leadof earlier state movements in Vermont, Hawaii, California, andMassachusetts. Thus far 3 states (California, Connecticut, andVermont) explicitly permit second parent or stepparent adoptionby same-sex couples, and an additional 20 states and the District ofColombia have legislation allowing same-sex adoption in certaincases (NGLTF 2004c). In some states such as Florida, however,gay and lesbian couples are not allowed to adopt at all, althoughcurrently this is being challenged in court (Liptak 2003).These civil rights victories have not gone unchallenged bythe Right. Anti-gay legislators and social movements (e.g., thereligious right) effectively have blocked the passage of severalpro-LGBT laws and policies and passed their own legislation, in-cluding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which was signedby President Bill Clinton in 1996 as a compromise with the Right.Legislating the Family 25Although DOMA is a very short piece of legislation, it has had asignificant impact on the LGBT rights movement. DOMA allowsstates the right to not honor other states' marriage contracts wheremarriage is defined differently. In this scenario, a state such as Ari-zona that has passed its own DOMA does not recognize domesticpartnerships of same-sex couples that were \"married\" in a statewhere they are recognized (e.g., Vermont). President Clinton'spassage of DOMA at the federal level paved the way for states toactively pass their own versions of the Defense of Marriage Act,thereby passing even stronger messages about who has the rightto marry and who does not. To date, 36 states have passed DOMA(NGLTF 2004d).DOMA alone has helped to institutionalize heterosexism inprofound ways because it blocks future proactive and protectivelegislation for gays and lesbians. LGBT activists and institutionswishing to work around DOMA have strategized to pass domes-tic partner laws and policies at state and local levels, including inprivate organizations, as a way to obtain the 1,000+ benefits forLGB employees/citizens that married couples are entitled to bydefault. Through this process, civil rights strategies have becomelocalized and \"privatized\" along with the broader privatizationof the social welfare system and economy: As with other poli-cies, poor LGBT individuals are the most likely to be left out inthis restructuring process, even by LGBT activists themselves.This has the additional consequence of creating forms of socialcontrol among non-profit and community organizations and alsowithin LGBT communities: there may be, for example, \"deserv-ing\" vs. \"undeserving\" homosexuals (Piven and Cloward 1993),and some are more likely to \"pass\" than others. As the histories ofother social movements (e.g., civil rights, women's) have shown,federal legislation alone does not create equality among all but itis crucial for providing legal equality across states.Social Welfare Policy and Lesbian, Gay,Bisexual and Transgender CommunitiesHeterosexist biases in social welfare policy frameworks ex-ist in at least three ways: through policies that explicitly targetLGBT individuals as abnormal or deviant, such as policies that26 Journal of Sociology & Social Welfaredefend the institution of heterosexual marriage; through federaldefinitions that assume all families are heterosexual, thereby im-plicitly leaving out LGBT individuals and families; and throughpolicies that overlook LGBT poverty and social need due to stereo-types about LGBT communities being affluent. The first typeof heterosexist bias has become particularly apparent since the1990s, when conservative political sectors organized more con-certed efforts to block or overturn LGBT civil rights legislation.Since the mid 1990s, social welfare policy initiatives have in-cluded explicit components about marriage that protect hetero-sexuality as a social institution. These policies began during theWilliam Jefferson Clinton administration (1992-2000) but havebeen promoted most fervently by the George W. Bush admin-istration (2000-present). The latest version of the TANF reau-thorization bill calls for dedicated federal funding sources for\"healthy marriage promotion\" activities and \"fatherhood pro-grams.\" Currently, provisions being considered by the Houseand Senate and supported by the President include $100 millionin competitive matching grants to states to develop \"innovativeapproaches to promoting healthy marriages,\" including \"publicadvertising campaigns on marriage,\" education in high schoolson the value of marriage, marriage enhancement and marriageskills training, divorce reduction programs, marriage mentoringprograms in \"at-risk communities\" (Fremstad et al. 2002:3). Theseprovisions also call for an additional $20 million annually thatwould be designated specifically for fatherhood programs, suchas promoting \"responsible parenting,\" improving fathers' familybusiness management skills, and premarital education programs(Fremstad et al. 2002: 3).Under current legislation, state governments have been of-fered incentives to provide marriage workshops in exchangefor additional funding. Since 1996, over $400 million per yearin public funds have been spent across the U.S. on abstinence-only-until-marriage education. In the abstinence campaigns, gay,lesbian and bisexual adolescents have no access to sex educationthat pertains to their sexual experiences. In addition, many schooldistricts throughout the country have developed laws forbiddingteachers from discussing homosexuality in any form, despite thefact that, according to one major national study conducted byLegislating the Family 27the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, seventy-six percent of parents of7- 1 2 th graders feel that sex education should cover homosexuality(Cahill and Jones 2002: 48).The George W. Bush administration (2000-present) hasmade it a priority to preserve the traditional heterosexual familythrough legislation and policy, including through his so-calledfaith-based initiatives. In January 2001, President Bush createdthe White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives(OFBCI); in December 2002, he signed an executive order direct-ing federal agencies to formulate and develop policies to ensure\"equal protection\" for faith-based organizations competing forgovernment contracts, thereby allowing organizations to com-pete for federal funds while maintaining their specific religiousperspective (Office of the President 2003). Thus far, the Bush ad-ministration claims that it has completed regulations that wouldallow religious groups to compete for nearly $20 billion in grantsadministered by the Department of Health and Human Services,and it is currently completing regulations for the Departmentof Housing and Urban Development and for the Departmentsof Justice, Education and Labor (Stevenson 2003). In September2003, the Bush administration awarded $30.5 million in grants to81 religious and community groups to develop their own socialwelfare programs; in 2002, $24 million was awarded under thesame program to 21 groups (Stevenson 2003).Because the executive order and subsequent acts allow faith-based service providers to operate by a different set of rules thanother non-profit and for-profit organizations, they potentiallypave the way for further discrimination against LGBT people andwomen who do not fit within faith-based organizations' visionsof the family or those \"in need.\" In addition to the general con-cern that the separation of church and state has been overriddenthrough this executive order, historically marginalized groupssuch as LGBT people, poor single mothers, and other social sec-tors considered \"undeserving\" are especially likely to lose outin religious-based forms of service delivery. Nonetheless, OFBCIDirector James Towey has stated that President Bush \"was 'goingto use every single tool that he has as chief executive' to advancehis goal of giving religious groups a greater role\" (Stevenson 2003,quote in text). This process is certain to reinforce the dominance28 Journal of Sociology & Social Welfareof institutionalized heterosexuality in American social policy andsocial welfare distribution. To the extent that it will exclude LGBTpeople from access to resources and/or from being seen as fullcitizens, these regulations potentially undermine the struggle forLGBT civil rights in the United States. Thus while it is importantto address LGBT civil rights incrementally, it is also crucial thatresearchers and policy-makers examine the institution of hetero-sexuality as an integral part of U.S. welfare policy reform, as evenpolicies that appear not to have anything to do with sexual orgender identity have specific implications for LGBT communitiesin need of assistance from the state and private social serviceagencies.The second type of heterosexist bias in social welfare policyconcerns how \"the family\" and \"household\" are federally de-fined, including in the U.S. Census. Although there is no specificquestion on the census about sexual orientation/identity, censusdata serves as a self-disciplining factor in defining sexual citi-zenship through self-reporting at the household level. Income,employment rates, family size, military service, citizen status, andpoverty statistics are just a few of the many variables collected,all of which combined contributes to the \"governmentality of thecloset at the national scale,\" as Michael Brown and Paul Boyleobserve (2000: 90). For the purposes of data collection in theCurrent Population Survey (CPS), the U.S. Bureau of the Census(2003) defines family and household as separate categories. A\"family\" is defined as \"a group of two or more (one of whom is thehouseholder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residingtogether.\" A household, in contrast, \"consists of all people whooccupy a housing unit,\" and is further divided according to its sta-tus as a \"family household\" or \"non-family household,\" thus re-inforcing the legal distinction between families (i.e., those that arerelated through blood, marriage or adoption, as defined by law)vs. non-families (e.g., same-sex households). A family householdis defined as \"a household maintained by a householder who isin a family (as defined above) and includes any unrelated peoplewho may be residing there.\" A non-family household is definedas a \"householder living alone or where the householder sharesthe home exclusively with people to whom he/she is not related\"(U.S. Bureau of the Census 2003). Clearly, these definitions privi-Legislating the Family 29lege the institution of marriage over domestic partnerships, andthe status of heterosexual families over other types of families.While to some degree these definitions are contradictory andopen to interpretation, they form an important basis for recentwelfare legislation and related proposals to promote \"two-parentfamilies\" through marriage (Brown and Boyle 2000).Available studies show that there is an enormous disjuncturebetween popular conceptions of \"the family\" in current politicaldiscourse and the reality. For example, according to the 2000 U.S.Census, 44 percent of U.S. adults are not married, and marriedcouples with children make up less than one-quarter of U.S.households (Cahill and Jones 2002: 12). A recent study by theHuman Rights Campaign (HRC) shows that over one millionsame-sex unmarried partner households self-identified in the2000 U.S. Census; for a variety of reasons, this figure is believed tobe a gross undercount of same-sex unmarried partner households(Smith and Gates 2001). Based on the 2000 U.S. Census data, theHRC study estimates that over 3 million gay and lesbian peopleare \"living together in the U.S. in committed relationships inthe same residence\"(Smith and Gates 2001: 2). The study alsoestimates that the U.S. population is comprised of over 10 milliongay and lesbian people; a lower estimate than the 10 % that earliergay and lesbian activists estimated but consistent with recentstudies that estimate gays and lesbians to be 5% of the total U.S.population. This research demonstrates the need for policies thataddress the specific needs of LGBT families in the U.S.The third type of heterosexist bias in social welfare policyframeworks is a result of stereotypes about lesbian, gay and bi-sexual (LGB) individuals and families as affluent or as \"HINKs\"(High Income, No Kids). These stereotypes tend to reproducethe invisibility of LGB families in social welfare policy frame-works and in research on poverty; they also completely overlookthe experiences of transgendered LGB individuals. For example,lesbians, gays and bisexuals often remain invisible in studies ofpoverty because they are viewed as \"family-less.\" Rather thanbeing viewed as part of a family, it is often assumed that LGBadults have no children. Following this already tainted logic, ifLGB households have no children or less children than hetero-sexual households, they are assumed to have fewer family fi-30 Journal of Sociology & Social Welfarenancial responsibilities and subsequently higher overall incomesthan heterosexual households in their same age group-thus con-tributing to the common stereotype that most LGB householdsare wealthy or better-off than their heterosexual counterparts.This assumption, combined with other forms of heterosexism andhomophobia, leads policy-makers to believe that LGB people, asa group, do not experience poverty. As a result, LGB people areseen as not in need of any economic, social and health-relatedservices (with the important exception treatment for HIV/AIDS,in which case many gay men have been targeted as a \"socialproblem\" or as a risk to health security-see Farmer 1992; Wright2000). In most cases, those who do have access to governmentsubsidies, health care and social services must do so through thelens of institutionalized heterosexuality: as \"single\" people and aslegally unmarried, and many undergo discriminatory treatmentas patients as a result.Existing studies show that economic levels among LGB peo-ple range significantly and can be differentiated by group aswell. For example, in his pioneer study of gay male communi-ties in San Francisco, Manuel Castells (1983) found that \". . . onthe whole, [lesbians] are poorer than gay men... and are lesslikely to achieve local power.\" (Castells 1983: 140). Gay men andlesbians experience class differently in part due to their distinctgendered experiences, although this of course varies accordingto other factors as well. Several studies since then have critiquedCastells' assertion and pointed out the economic and income dif-ferentiation of LGBT households by gender in combination withrace, class, citizen status, and/or geographic location (Knopp1995; Badgett 2001). For instance, in some cities where there arelarger, relatively concentrated lesbian populations, lesbians havemore wealth relative to national rates of wealth among lesbians(Rothenberg 1995). More recent studies, such as that of M. V. LeeBadgett (1998), challenge the myth that LGBT people are affluent.Rather, Badgett argues, \"Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgenderpersons are not, as a class, richer than heterosexuals. In somecases, we appear to earn less.\" (Badgett 1998: i). Recently releasedU.S. Census data from California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey,New York, and Texas shows that same-sex households are similarto other families in these states on variables that include income,Legislating the Family 31family size, employment rates, military service and citizen status,thus supporting the idea that LGB families are as economicallydiverse and stratified as heterosexual families (HRC 2003*). Andalthough there is a paucity of data on the economic and classexperiences of transgendered people, preliminary evidence basedon secondary studies would indicate that many transgenderedpeople, including self-defined transsexuals, male-to-female andfemale-to-male transgendered individuals, are not wealthier thanheterosexuals as a class (Cahill and Jones 2002). Like anywhere,some LGB people are upper class, wealthy and/or work in high-paying professional fields. However, the stereotype of wealthamong LGB people is just that: a stereotype.Due to a combination of social, economic and cultural factors,many gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered peoplehave difficulty finding jobs and/or keeping them (i.e., becauseof their appearance, because of homophobic work environment,blatant discrimination, and the disciplining of heterosexualityand/or gender identity in the workplace-see McDowell 1995), inaddition to the fact that many of their families do not accept themnor provide the kinds of support that heterosexuals receive (e.g.,college tuition or living expenses, support for a new house or wed-ding, providing advice on the job market, and associated forms ofemotional support). Additionally, financial success often dependsupon one's willingness and/or ability to \"pass\" as heterosexualand/or as appropriately gendered in a given context (MacDowell1995). These issues demonstrate that there is a need for a broaderdefinition of poverty that includes, for example, personal safetyand freedom of abuse as well as economic hardship (Abramovitz1988; Cahill and Jones 2002). Policy-makers could also benefitfrom more research on how sexual identity shapes individuals'views on the social welfare system, including social service agen-cies, non-profits, government offices, and federal agencies.Conclusion: Implications for Research and PolicyThis article has addressed three important reasons for thepersistent heterosexist biases in social welfare policy frameworks:Federal legislation and policies that explicitly target homosexual-ity as \"abnormal\" or \"unnatural,\" such as DOMA; restricted legal32 Journal of Sociology & Social Welfaredefinitions of \"the family\" in federal policy; and stereotypes aboutLGBT individuals and families. In closing, I wish to offer somesuggestions for future research on social welfare policies, withthe aim of denaturalizing institutionalized heterosexuality andbringing LGBT communities to the center of research on poverty,families, and state policy. First, there is a need to re-envision thenotion of social welfare itself. Central to social welfare policyframeworks is a heterosexist understanding of families, indi-viduals and citizenship. Rather than being a natural, essentialaspect of our society, the institution of heterosexuality is sociallyconstructed and has been produced through these very policiesand laws (in conjunction with cultural practices, the educationalsystem, religious institutions, etc.) that establish hierarchies andpower relations in our society. It is crucial that we begin to exam-ine the connections among welfare reforms themselves and themany other forms of policy that coincide with these policies toproduce an \"appropriate\" welfare recipient and citizen (Fraserand Gordon 1994). Furthermore, it is important that we examinesuch policies in a global perspective, since our policies have conse-quences for families in the U.S. and abroad, through immigration,foreign, and international development policies (Hondagneu-Sotelo 2001; Luibh~id 2002; Lind and Share 2003).The queering of welfare reform is a much-needed project. TheNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) has produced oneof the most comprehensive studies to date on the effects of welfareand family policies on LGBT communities in the United States(Cahill and Jones 2002). In order to truly construct equitable poli-cies and systems of distribution, we would need to examine theroots of institutionalized heterosexuality as a central aspect of theU.S. welfare state, in addition to other forms of institutionalizeddiscrimination or bias. Only this way can we envision a societywith all families in mind.BibliographyAbramovitz, Mimi. 1988. Regulating the lives of women: Social welfare policy fromcolonial times to the present.

    "abstract": "This article addresses the effects of heterosexist bias in social welfare policy frameworks on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals and families in the United States. It discusses the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), federal definitions of family and household, and stereotypes about LGBT individuals. It argues that poor LGBT individuals and families lack full citizen rights and access to needed social services as a result of these explicit and implicit biases",
