Lawson, B.S.A thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Scienceat Virginia Commonwealth University.Virginia Commonwealth University, 2023Major Director: Gina Marie Longo, Assistant Professor, VCU SociologyTwitch.tv is a live entertainment platform where individuals live stream events, including playingvideo games, playing board and tabletop games, creating art, and more. Twitch has a diverse baseof streamers, but Twitch has just begun. The most common approach has focused on cisgender,heterosexual white men in the cases where it has been studied. Though these streamers should bestudied in sociology, this focus leaves out the experiences of both cis women and Trans*streamers. This research proposal tries to situate the relationship of Trans* streamers with boththe platform and their audience, seeing if these relationships affect their ability to earn incomeand status in a precarious digital workplace. This study will incorporate a primarily qualitativeapproach, interviewing cisgender, Transgender, and non-binary streamers about theirexperiences.21. IntroductionAs a concept and as a focus of sociological inquiry, Twitch is relatively new. Twitch.tvlaunched in 2011, a video game-focused spinoff of the earlier Justin.tv, a live-streaming platformbased around streaming daily life or 'lifestreaming .'Twitch exploded in popularity in 2014following the collaborative event Twitch Plays Pokémon, an event where viewers could inputcommands in the chat, collectively controlling the gameplay. Later that year, Amazon purchasedTwitch for $970 million (Zac 2020). Twitch has become a popular platform for live streaming,particularly video game live streaming. However, despite the popularity of Twitch.tv as a form ofdigital media, it has rarely been researched within a sociological context. A search within theEbscohost SocINDEX for the phrase Twitch.Tv returns only eight results (, Dargonaki 2018,American Sociological Association 2019, Johnson 2019, Johnson and Woodcock July 2019,Johnson and Woodcock March 2019, Spilker, Ask, Hansen 2020, Ehret and Čiklovan 2020,Teodora 2022).For many people, live streaming is more than a hobby; but is a growing profession wheremany individuals make a livelihood. However, this labor is more complex than playing videogames all day. It also incorporates emotional work and labor, along with aspects of gender.(Taylor 2018, Ruberg, Cullen, and Brewster 2019, and Freeman and Wohn 2020.) Much of thesociological research surrounding Twitch focuses on general experiences that highlight mainlymen. The sociological research on women discusses women via their relationship to the Twitchuser policy (Ruberg et al. 2019). We know relatively little about the positions of Trans* andnon-binary streamers on the platform. Considering the precariousness of Trans* and(particularly) non-binary individuals within physically situated economies, this precariousness3may also be reflected for Trans* and non-binary streamers within digital labor, which can place apremium on appearance and presentation1.This study used in-depth interviews from three groups: Trans* and gendernon-conforming streamers and their cisgender counterparts, to investigate how gender identityinfluences how streamers navigate their interactions with their audiences. In other words, how doTwitch streamers' gender identity and performance affect their interactions with the audience,and to what extent this creates digital labor inequalities? I argue that Trans* and non-binaryindividuals face higher difficulties making a living through Twitch. Trans* and non-binarystreamers view their relationships between themselves and the twitch viewing audiencedifferently than cis streamers even though cis, Trans*, and non-binary streamers interact withtheir audiences similarly. anticipate2. Literature Review2.1 Gaming and GenderTwitch, as an industry, is situated within the gaming culture. However, gaming and theculture surrounding is still firmly entrenched within a gender binary. The idea of video games,gaming culture, game development, and the identity of the gamer itself are all compared andseen as aligned with masculinity (Shaw 2011, Todd 2015, Zolides 2015, Paaßen, Morgenroth,Stratomeyer 2016, Cote 2017, Dargonaki 2018). This is not new to the subculture but has beenpart of an intensifying 'culture war' (Todd 2015, 65). Gamergate, the exemplification of this 'war,'is an online social movement that engages in cyberbullying directed mainly at journalists andscholars within the gaming industry (Todd 2015, Cote 2017). One of the most controversialexamples of Gamergate was the harassment of Zoe Quinn. An independent game developer was1 Note: the majority of this study will use Trans* instead of just saying trans and non-binary. Trans* is intended tobe inclusive of non-conforming identities alongside other gender identities, like gender queer and agender.4accused of sleeping with a gamer journalist in return for a positive game review (Todd 2015, 64,Cote 2017, 138).Though false, this and many other incidents laid bare the worst of the gender relationsand expectations within the gaming subculture. Harassment is rampant within gaming culture,with women, ethnic minorities, and the LBGT community being most likely to be victims of thisgaming-related harassment (Cote 2017, 137). Harassment occurs both from within and outsidethe gaming industry, encouraged through game design and advertising has developed a culture ofhyper-masculinity. This aggressive form of masculinity has influenced gaming culture,exacerbating underlying masculine associations and leading to women being seen as outsiders(Zolides 2015, Cotes 2017). Gender presentation in gaming spaces is often questioned due tothese cultural and institutional factors, with femininity being physically and conceptuallymarginalized within gaming spaces. Gaming culture marginalized femininity, with maleidentities often seen as the default, making women less likely to use voice chat (Paaßen et al.2016). An institutionalized focus on objectification and misogyny (Huyles 2007, 24) has led tothe questioning of female legitimacy within gaming (Cote 2016) and even the harassment offemale professional gamers by their peers and coaches, like Miranda Pakozdi (Cote 2017, 138).Further, there is a tendency for gaming to be heteronormative and, at worst homophobic (Shaw2011, 36). Formal clothing by male players is often avoided due to a connotation of femininity(Zolides 2015, 46), indicating that this policing of gender in gaming cuts both ways.The relationship between gender is more than presentation but delves into individualidentity. A gamer can be defined as an individual who plays video games regularly (Shaw 2011,29). Men are more likely than women to see an overlap between their gender identity and gameridentity, leading to a social identification with the gamer identity (Paaßen et al. 2016, 11).5Gaming and the identity of gamer are still defined as male despite growing gender parity, withwomen still marked as outsiders (Cote 2017, 139). These outsider statuses often lead womenwith few options. The typical 'male' rhetorical approaches of logic and aggression are notafforded to women in online spaces and are often seen as illegitimate when used by women(Cote 2017, 144). Instead, women must approach gaming with different strategies, includingassuming more dominant stances (Zolides 2015, 45, Cote 2017, 207) and avoiding playing withstrangers (Cote 2017).However, there are reasons individuals of all genders are drawn to video games. Forsome, it is a safe avenue to explore gender identity and as a way to cope with distress (Arcoleuset all 2017, 22). Women's involvement in video game violence allows them to show theirmechanical proficiency within the gaming sphere. There are positive aspects of gaming thatshould be kept in mind., such as building community and its ability to allow for an exploration ofidentity (Freeman and Wohn, 2020). These aspects of gaming are also reflected within Twitchand would allow us to better understand the relationship between gender on Twitch, with manyindividuals turning to video games for self-expression and gender exploration.2.2 Digital Labor and GenderTwitch also needs to be situated within its labor has undergone several radical shifts inthe past twenty years. Our lives have become more digital. This shift has also coincided with afracturing of the economy, where more and more work is precarious and compartmentalized.Much of modern labor is characterized by its precarious nature. Compared to traditionalemployment, precarious work can be defined by job insecurity. It includes part-time work, tempjobs, self-employment, contract work, and online work (Gerber 2021, 208). Online work is oftenanother type of precarious labor. It is quickly becoming one of the most prominent types of6precarious work, with 90% percent of new jobs being non-traditional and often online (Borazilay2019, 183). Further, around 45 million Americans offer various goods and services throughplatform work (Barizalay 2019). Risk has become tied into the modern labor market, with riskinternalized as subjective and positive (Neff 2012, 3-4, Kane and Jasserard 2019, 485) andshifted onto the workers instead of businesses (Neff 2012, 8)The gig economy, platform economy, and sharing economy are among the many namesof the modern online digital economy. The gig economy is dominated by five major platforms,which include Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon (Zysman 2020, 57). It shouldbe noted that these companies are often not seeking workers themselves but instead areintermediates (Zysman 2020, 56, Gerber 2021, 207). Though this work is more accessible acrossage, educational level, and class spectrums, it still has adverse effects, especially for those whosedigital labor makes up most of their income. There are issues of work/life balance (Warren 2021,526) and also planning around an unsteady income stream (Sutherland, Jarrahi, Dunn, Nelson2020, 458). Workers often have to engage with multiple sources of work outside of traditionalwork in order to make income (Kane and Jasserand 2019, 486). This labor, combined withwork/life balance, can lead to the blurring of boundaries between life and labor, leading topresence bleed (Duffy 2017, 29, Kohransch and Weber 2020, 18). It is also an extremelycompetitive workforce, with a large pool of workers having to compete, bid style, for a smallnumber of jobs (Barizalay 2019, 193), leading to a pressured need to be always available forwork.The gig economy is also heavily gendered. Like most occupations, digital labor has itsown gender beliefs. Much like traditional work, digital labor tends to encourage ideas of power,strength, and rationality gendered as male (Kohransch and Weber 2020, 13-16). Despite this,7much digital labor takes a more feminine form of labor, based more on affect, relationships, andemotion (Duffy 2017). Though the issues inherent to the digital economy affect everyone,women are more likely to face difficulties. Often women are more likely to make more incomethrough precarious online than their male counterparts, often due to unpaid labor concerns (Vyas2021, 381). Women are more likely than men to make 50% or even 100% of their income viaplatform work (Gerber 2021, 16). Women are also more likely to be excluded from gig workthan their male counterparts. This is an intersectional issue as well, with women, particularlyBlack women facing more issues being successful at making income through online gig work(Vyas 2021, 43-44).Though digital labor is supposed to be egalitarian, intentional and unintentional biaseslead to discrimination. Women are less likely to receive positive reviews and will request lowerpay than men in many cases (Barzilay 2019, 185). Often sex stereotypes still prevail within gigwork scenarios, with many jobs left up to the client’s discretion and satisfaction, leavingworker’s chances up to customer bias (Kohransch and Weber 2020, 22). Further, the platformsthat host this digital labor, like all websites, are built around algorithms. Algorithms carry thebiases of the data and developers used in their creation. These algorithms are seen by theirdevelopers as egalitarian but can actually exacerbate discrimination by focusing on reputations(garnered through reviews) (Kohransch and Weber 2020, 22), and can lead to genderdiscrimination and even racial profiling in a supposedly egalitarian workspace (Vyas 2021, 44).However, digital workers are not well protected against gender discrimination and racistpractices due to their work classification. Often, these workers are seen not as employees butlegally more as entrepreneurs or self-employed individuals, meaning that legal protections such8as Title VII only apply across some platforms as they would for traditional labor (Barzilay 2019,196).On the other side of streaming, there is the rise of the 'prosumer' and 'participatory' labor.The prosumer is an individual who assists in production as part of an economic system that putsa premium on participation (Pybus 2013). This participatory labor is generally not seen as laborbut is broadly used in digital marketing. Social scientists have studied this participatory digitallabor. The prosumer, constantly inundated by advertising, are engaged in participation in such away that helps develop branding and engagement. Interacting digitally also allows advertiserscloser access, allowing more access to the prosumer (Pybus 2013, 148).Further study should research the relationship between streamers and digital workers.Much digital work is commodified, with workers' labor further segmented into a fragmentedmicrowork. Building networks and developing an online profile are essential for online gigworkers to find good work (Sutherland et al., 2020). In the same way, Twitch streamers oftenmust find a way to balance a creative drive versus a profitable, audience-pleasing presentation, arelationship that may be affected by factors like class, gender, and sexuality.2.3: Labor in the Digital Gig Economy and TwitchTwitch live streaming is a continuation of labor following the development of Web 3.0with the rise of social media, emphasizing entrepreneurship (Marwick 2013, Taylor 2018).Though Male live streamers primarily dominate Twitch.tv, much of the occupation of livestreaming follows the 'feminized' labor, where the work is feminized and often based more onflexibility, creativity, and affect. (Duffy 2017).Modern labor practices are multifaceted and often classified along gendered lines.Entrepreneurial labor is a combination of time, energy, human capital, and other resources,9expressing entrepreneurial ideals through non-entrepreneurs (Neff 2013, 16). Considering theoverall precarity of traditional labor, digital labor is increasingly seen as a fulfilling andprofitable venture. Digital labor is first defined as \"Any productive human activity involvingdigital technologies as 'the valorization of the digital work of creating social media content'(Chandler and Munday, 2016). However, precarity is not limited to just traditional labor.According to Precarity Lab, \"Chained up is more than complicity; it means noticing the woundsinflicted by false promises of idealized counterculture, technological progress, and digitalintervention (2019).\"Though playing video games live on stream and chatting with an audience may soundlike easy income, streaming as an occupation is more complex. The streaming hours can beexceedingly long, especially if a streamer works full-time (Johnson 2019). Along with longhours, Johnson and Woodcock discussed the behind-the-scenes work necessary for a successfultwitch stream. This work includes preparing for the stream, answering emails, creating contacts,and networking (T.L. Taylor 2018, Johnson and Woodcock 2019, 344). In some cases, theinspiration and justification for the long, unpaid labor toward becoming successful are similar tothe aspirational labor described in a study of online fashion bloggers (Duffy 2017). ThroughDuffy's study of online fashion bloggers, she studies the relationship between the bloggers, theiraudience, and the fashion brands that employ them as advertisers and influencers. Many of thesebloggers have to juggle an often-fraught relationship with fashion companies while also trying toappear authentic to fans (Duffy 2017), showing a balancing act between the creator, audience,and, for the lack of a term, an employer.In similar ways to fashion bloggers (Duffy 2017), attracting advertisers and sponsors isone of the integral ways of earning income on Twitch. There are several types of monetization10utilized by twitch streamers (Woodcock and Johnson 2019), including sponsorship, subscription,donating, and advertisement. Subscription is a recurring monthly payment, with Twitch and thestreamer receiving part of this monthly revenue (Woodcock and Johnson 2019, 4). The secondform, donating and cheering, are not donations in the charitable sense but much more liketaxable freelance pay (Woodcock and Johnson 2019). New twitch streamers commonly use thisbefore having a higher platform or reaching 'affiliate status' who share PayPal links and otherservices (Woodcock and Johnson 2019, 4-5). Twitch has recently institutionalized donations as'bits,' their platform currency. Purchasing bits allows users to 'cheer' their favorite streamers,transferring those bits to the streamer. These bits typically have an exchange rate of one dollarfor every 100 bits. (Woodcock and Johnson 2019, 5). Advertising, a more traditional style ofmonetization, is also seen in digital media. Twitch uses two different types of advertising; adsdeveloped in conjunction with advertisers and the more conventional inserted videos (Woodcockand Johnson 2019, 5). The fourth type of monetization, sponsorship, is when a game developeror publisher pays the streamer to play the game on stream (Woodcock and Johnson 2019).Twitch exists as part of the internet as a digital institution, one that actively shapes andinfluences interactions between individuals on multiple levels (Longo 2023, 623). Twitch, withits detailed terms of services, rules between streamers and their audiences, and its regulation as aplatform, influences and restricts interactions between streamers, the platform, and viewers.2.4.: Gender, Class, and Race on Twitch.tvThere has been significant research into race and gender in the digital economy (Shade2014; Duffy and Pruncneiwska 2017; Fuchs 2018; and Sutherland et al. 2020). However, therehas been significantly less research on Twitch regarding race and gender. Furthermore, what littleresearch featuring race has focused on white men (Johnson and Woodcock 2019), with some11notable exceptions.2. Digital economy research regarding gender tends to take a heteronormativeviewpoint, focusing on teleworking mothers and fathers (Shade 2014). Much like traditionallabor, labor in the digital gig economy is not equal; people of color, low-income individuals, andindividuals with no college education who work digitally rely on it as basic income rather than asurplus income. In a traditional labor market tied to credential inflation, digital gig work allowsless credentialled workers to earn a living. Furthermore, research into disabled twitch streamersfound that those with chronic health conditions, both mental and physical, were able to make aliving while also managing their chronic health conditions (Johnson 2019). Furthermore, somedisabled workers see digital labor as self-fulfilling, voluntary, and not profit-driven (Yu, Goggin,Fisher, and Li 2019, 468).Further, there have been studies into how gender is approached and policed by Twitchand Twitch users. Not surprisingly, the policing of gender has been chiefly applied negativelytoward women and marginalized streamers like people of color and the LGBTQ community.There has long been discourse around the 'titty streamer' concept, a term derisively directed atfemale streamers who present themselves too sexually (Ruberg, Cullen, and Brewster, 2019).This phrase first entered Twitch discourse around 2013 and targeted individuals who supposedlyover-emphasize their breasts and body, with less focus on video game playing (Ruberg et al.2019, 472). This phrase is often used in conjunction with 'cam girl'. Outside of Twitch, cam girlrefers to women that perform sexual activities in front of a webcam for an audience and typicallyrelate to the adult film industry (Ruberg et al. 2019, 473). In the case of Twitch, this phrase isused to devalue the labor that the streamers have to do, such as playing video games, managinglighting, and audio-visual equipment, instead of reducing these female streamers to their bodies2 Chan, Brian, and Kishonna Gray, 2020, \"Microstreaming, Microcelebrity, and Marginalized Masculinity: Pathwaysto Visibility and Self-Definition for Black Men in Gaming,\"Women's Studies in Communication, 43(4):354-362.12(Ruberg et al. 2019, 273). Both phrases are used to question the legitimacy of these streamers bymale streamers and by other female streamers. This body policing relates to anxiety withinTwitch regarding the broader issues of live streaming legitimacy and how this may affectlivelihoods all. At the same time, there is a double standard where men are praised for theirincome on Twitch while women making income on Twitch can be labeled illegitimate byappearance (Ruberg et al. 2019, 275). Twitch's further regulation of female streamers'appearances (Ruberg 2020) highlights this.Studies such as Freeman and Wohn (2020) are beginning to focus on the presentation ofgender and sexuality in Twitch live streaming. Though this study is drawn more fromInformatics and Computing, this study falls in line with sociological analysis, highlighting therelationship between the audience and the streamer and the presentation of gender and sexuality.Though the bulk of the interviewees from the study are cisgender, the study elucidates how queerstreamers, in general, may view their place on the platform. For example, one Trans* intervieweesees streaming as a way to garner a broader Trans* community and allow the interviewee tonavigate their Trans*ition (Freeman and Wohn 2020, 807-808). Further, this study found thatsome live streamers use live streaming on Twitch for both activism and empowerment regardingtheir gender and sexual identities (Freeman and Wohn 2020, 809). Harassment continues to be anissue within live streaming, with women, queer people, and people of color bearing its brunt,reflecting a broader internet trend of a fixation on gender and appearance on internetspectatorship (Taylor 2018, 221). This harassment may not just be personal but can also beperformed on a general level, and managing this harassment is part of community management.There are physical and mental tactics streamers have to deal with to cultivate a safe environment,including moderation teams, not using a live stream camera, or 'toughening up, but there is still13the strain of harassment that can drive away would-be streamers (Taylor 2018, 221-222). Withina Computer Supported Cooperative Work study, there is a focus on the streaming of gender andsexuality of streamers. Though this is not a strictly sociological article, it highlights several keyaspects of understanding the motivation for streamers. Freeman and Wohn found that female andLGBTQ streamers were more likely to deemphasize an audience focus and focus more onself-expression (2020).Further, these streamers would put much more work into outfits and costuming andwould have a more significant focus on lighting and camera management (Guo and Wohn 2020,816). However, they did have to deal with audience expectations not always matching up withthe aspirations of the streamer. This study, though limited, is a good indicator of how to approachsociological research regarding the platform.3. Current Study and Statement of the ProblemThis thesis builds on existing research on the broader field of digital labor and attempts tocontribute to a growing sociological analysis of Twitch. This research contributes to thesociological study of the digital gig economy and gender while also studying a community, inthis case, Trans* and non-binary streamers, who are often marginalized within Twitch and arerarely a focus of study in sociology. Twitch is extremely popular as an entertainment platform,with millions of users following their interests and building an audience. However, as much aswe understand the complexities of live streaming as an occupation, we know much less about thegendered dynamics of streaming, especially regarding marginalized identities like non-binaryand Trans* streamers. Twitch has also become part of the digital economy, where streamers canmake what they consider a fulfilling livelihood. However, much like online fashion bloggers(Duffy 2017), this working relationship is precarious. As a subsidiary of Amazon, Twitch14generated an estimated 1.54 billion dollars, 300 million of which came from advertising (Iqbal2020). A relationship with advertisers is critical to the streamers and the platform, allowing forhigher profit. While some streamers can make millions of dollars a year, this is not the case forthe vast majority of 3.8 million streamers and 41,100 partners (Iqbal 2020). This researchexplores how streamers make a living while navigating within and around Twitch's rules andregulations while maintaining positive relationships with advertisers, sponsors, Twitch, and theiraudience. I argue that gender makes these relationships more precarious, particularly for Trans*-and non-binary streamers. This study examines how gender non-binary and Trans* streamersnavigate audience relationships compared to their cis-gender counterparts. By centering Trans*-and gender non-binary voices, this research contributes to the literature on digital gig economies,gaming, and gender. With millions of unique streamers just on Twitch, there is merit in studyingthe gender experiences of live streamers and Twitch's growing role in the digital economy.4. Case Study: Twitch4.1: The Twitch FanbaseSome may see Twitch as a shiny piece of disposable new media, but Twitch is rapidlybecoming a more significant part of the digital economy and, for many individuals, either part oftheir livelihood or an important source of income (Johnson and Woodcock 2019a Taylor 2018).Further, Twitch is owned by Amazon and generates substantial income for the company, withTwitching making 2.3 billion dollars in 2020, with 750 million dollars of that revenue comingfrom advertising on the platform (I. Much of the existing literature covers the twitch streams ofwhite male streamers (Johnson and Woodcock 2019 and Johnson 2019), with gaps regarding raceand gender. Available literature may show how the Twitch audience may be 'prosumers', but theresearch also shows why audiences are drawn to Twitch instead of traditional television. In15countries like Norway, where it is common in the top ten most visited websites (Spilker, Ask,and Hansen 2020), and South Korea, where video game live streams have enjoyed publicprominence since the late 2000s (Wulf, Schneider, and Beckert 2020). With such a broad interestin Twitch streaming as entertainment, a greater understanding of audience engagement should beapplied to this research, as the audience makes up a third of the streaming equation, along withthe streamer themselves and Twitch as a platform. As it is a very social medium, social scientistshave started to study this trend. 'Para-social' interactions were first developed in psychology tostudy viewer engagement and are defined as “long-term involvement with media characterscomparable to some kind of friendship (Wulf et al. 2020, 332).\" Further research developed twospecific kinds of para-social relationships, the 'virtual friendship' and the 'respectful interest.'Virtual friendship is an intimate relationship or friendship (Wulf et al., 2020). 'Like an oldfriend' is a common phrase to denote this relationship. Respectful interest is more complex and isa relationship based on viewers' impressions through media exposure (Wulf et al. 2020, 332).Twitch also contains many elements of social community, including membership, influence, needfulfillment, and emotional connection (Wulf et al. 2020, 333). Another study focused on thesocial motivations of twitch streaming, studying the motivators of twitch engagement. The fouraspects of live stream engagement include emotional connectedness, watching, subscribing, anddonating (Hilvert-Bruce, Neill, Sjöblom, Hamari 2018). They also found that those emotionallyattached to twitch streamers, those audience members were more likely to both view streams andprovide financial contributions to streams (Hilvert-Bruce et al., 2020, 63).4.2: Authenticity, Branding, and the SelfLive streaming is a relatively new career in the digital economy. However, for many, it isan alternative career for those who may have difficulties in a rapidly changing and precarious16workplace. Live streaming on Twitch places a premium on the emotion and performance of thelive streamers. Live streaming as a career requires multiple types of labor on the part of thestreamer, including affective labor and possibly aspirational labor. More than the digital freelancework of Upwork (Sutherland et al 2020) or online fashion and culture workers (Duffy 2017;Duffy and Pruchniewska 2017). A Twitch streamer's labor is based on the ability to communicateaudibly and visibly with their audience, through chat and audibly through streaming, oftenreading out chat comments, thanking fans, and rewarding them for subscribing or 'cheering'(Johnson and Woodcock 2019). As seen with discussions of gender and sexuality, women andqueer streamers may have to take different approaches from their straight, cis, and malecounterparts.Many are drawn to these digital content creators due to said creators' perceived\"authenticity\" (Marwick 2013, Duffy 2017). For Marwick, authenticity is less about personalinformation individuals release and more about being consistent in self-presentation (Marwick2013, 120). For Duffy, authenticity is more complex, with Duffy's authenticity focusing on thestruggle of digital content creators to balance authentic content with the demands of theiraudience (Duffy 2018, 54). Duffy argues that appeals to authenticity have long been part ofAmerican popular culture and advertising (2018, 103). In the case of digital fashion bloggers,audiences and business partners expect an authentic approach, leading to the bloggers having tofind a balance between being relatable but not 'selling out.'With Twitch, there are certain normative expectations of streamers. In this case,impression management (Goffman 1959), emotion work (Hochschild 1979), and performativity(Butler 2007) play a crucial role. When streaming, streamers are expected to be constantly 'on'.17There is an importance placed on the role of streaming 'in character'. This character work canrange from mild to intense (Johnson and Woodcock 2019).Gender performativity, both emphasized and deemphasized, is prominent throughpreliminary research (Dargonaki 2018). Judith Butler's theory of gender performativity wasdeveloped initially in 1990 in her theoretical text Gender Trouble. Differing from genderperformance and the way individuals present their gender, gender performativity is regulatoryand normative. Specifically, gender performativity regulates 'gestures' and 'acts' in a mannermeant to contain gender within the frame of heterosexual reproductivity (Butler 2009, 185-186).However heteronormative traditional media may be, new digital media, with its moreindividualized output, may allow for greater freedom outside traditional heteronormativeboundaries. However, the user base of Twitch still skews heavily male at 65 percent (Iqbal 2020),with data drawn from the Global Web Index. For some streamers, there may be normative rolesthat they are expected to portray regarding their gender and emotions that audiences may eitherbe drawn to or repudiate, depending on streamer and audience expectations.5. Methods5.1.Sampling and Case SelectionThis research is a comparative study to develop this field of study further. To this end, Iinterview Trans* and cis streamers about their experiences on the platform, whether thesestreamers view Twitch as a current or possible occupation, and explore how these streamers mayhave to perform to develop an audience. Further, these interviews examine how Trans* streamersoperate as digital laborers on Twitch by seeing how they garner new followers, gain subscribers,and earn bits and points on the platform. How do they maximize these while still staying18'authentic,' and how do their tactics differ from their cis counterparts? What kind of communitiesdo these different live streamers attempt to develop? To this end, I use non-probability sampling,looking for interviewees within five categories. These include cis male, cis female, Trans* male,Trans* female, and non-binary. Seven interviews were conducted, containing interviews for thedifferent categories, though one interviewee was gender queer rather than non-binary. I choosethese categories for simplicity's sake, with these gender identities being common, allowingvariety without making the interview collection process too complex. I do realize this doespossibly leave out gender identities like genderqueer3, genderfluid4 or otherwise, gendernon-conforming5. As much as I would like to include more diverse gender identities, I realizethat I am somewhat limited as this is a thesis and not a dissertation or an academic article. Infuture studies, I will include these individuals. Using open-coding of the Trans*cripts via Nvivo,I, first, focus on the differing articulations of gender identity and labor within Twitch betweenthe different interviews. Thereafter, I draw on the axial coding process, using concepts of gender,gender identity, and gender performativity to analyze how interviewees speak on theirexperiences on Twitch, connecting interpersonal relations, labor, and certain aspects of the digitalinstitution of Twitch.I recruited interviewees using an interest survey posted on the subreddits r/twitch andr/twitchstartup. Twenty-eight responded in all with 12 individuals agreeing to be interviewed.However, seven ultimately sat for the interview. These interviews were conducted via Zoom. Iuse pseudonyms prior to recording to protect the interviewee’s privacy. The interviews5 Gender non-conforming is an umbrella term that incorporates individuals who do not conform to traditional ideasof gender expression or whose gender identity does not fit into gendered categories (HRC Foundation).4 Someone who is genderfluid will not have a fixed gender identity. Those who identify as genderfluid may have anunfixed gender identity (University of Nebraska Omaha)3 Genderqueer can be defined as an individual who does not express their gender identity within the genderbinary, some who identify as genderqueer may not identify as male or female. (HRC Foundation)19generally lasted between 60 to 90 minutes. The interview questions pertained to their streaminghabits, their relationships and interactions with their audience, their experiences with technology,and gender identity and performance. Of the respondents, two are cis men, two are cis women,one is a Trans* woman, one is a Trans* man, and one is genderqueer. Four of my intervieweesare white, one identifies as Latino, one as Latino and Japanese, and another as Scotch-Irish andNorth American Indian. All the interviewees have gaming as a central element of their channel.None of the streamers stream as a full-time occupation, but several B (a genderqueer streamerfrom Brazil with 350 followers), Mark (a cis man in the United States with 55 followers), andMabel (a cis woman in the United States with around 90 followers) have some interest instreaming as an occupation. Many of them work in other digital labor positions, such as in videoproduction or design like Junes (a cis man with 75 followers) B, and Rory (a Trans* man in theUnited Kingdom with approximately 180 followers) work long hours in a management positionlike Mabel, worked multiple positions like Sarah (a cis woman in her 30s with 800 followers),work in low paid labor like Mark (a cis man in his twenties with 55 followers), or attend collegelike Kat (a Trans* woman in the United States with around 100 followers).I argue that the gender and gender identity of the streamer will affect the interactions astreamer has with an audience and with the Twitch platform. More specifically, gender affects therelationship between the streamer and the audience. The less conforming a streamer may be totraditional gender norms(as in closer to cisgender ideas of gender), the more negative therelationship between the audience and the streamer will be.206. Findings6.1. Gender, Interpersonal Interactions, and Twitch.tvGender, like in any other digital space, plays an influential role on Twitch.tv. Ideas ofgender identity and gender performativity are just as salient on Twitch and are complicated whenconsideration is placed toward the experiences of Trans* streamers, populations often out offocus within digital spaces. For Trans* streamers, live streaming can serve as a form ofcommunity building and self-expression, even when faced with harassment on the platform. Cisstreamers on the platform did not put much thought into their gender identities but foundthemselves being subtly pressured by forces of gender performativity, either internally orexternally.Building an audience as a Trans* streamer is rewarding but is also fraught withharassment and vitriol from random strangers. Harassment is not limited to one's own stream butcan also occur when a streamer is in the role of the viewer. For example, Kat, a Trans* woman,mentioned being harassed for her identity via a joke, where both the streamer she was viewingand the community members of the streamer did nothing to police that behavior, and shementions that most of the harassment comes from outside of her Twitch community, eitherthrough random viewers or through other social media platforms like Twitter stating,“The Twitch community, by and large, it's been a couple instances where, it wasn't in mycommunity. I was watching somebody else and it came up and It's like somebody decided tomake a particularly off color joke in response to my identifying myself. Streamer did nothingabout it. Community did nothing about it. So I just left that channel, kind of like cut ties because,I mean, I've been around the Twitch community since, what, 2017? Yeah, Twitch, by and large, isthe. One of the more welcoming communities like online communities, I've run into, the otherones, it is usually other other social spaces that are tied to because, you know, social media for aTwitch channel, it's all integrated. So it's typically other non community members that in myexperience, have been kind of a negative force.21B6, a genderqueer streamer from Brazil with around 350 followers, also foundthemselves harassed, particularly early on before he worked as a V-Tuber7, Moreso fromBrazilian viewers whom he described as being hostile towards queer streamers. Shifting toEnglish streaming, using a V-tuber persona, and shifting the games she plays has mitigated theharassment, but has not ended it, with individuals occasionally coming into her chat throughgame tags and making fun of her English, demonstrating different, contrasting hegemonicstructures, one that polices gender and sexuality, and another that polices ethnicity. However,tailoring his channel more and more has allowed B to create a community that is more focusedand communal.The idea of building a community that was safe for other Trans* people was a repeatedtheme. Rory, in particular, described how close he is to his audience, stating, “ I love hearingwhat they've been up to and the achievements in their lives. I mean, not long ago, one of myfollowers told me that they'd gotten a date for their top surgery, and I almost cried out of joy forthem.\" Being able to support viewers through times of transition in life and in their gender issomething important for Rory, Kat, and B. The methods of support, some of which are externalto the platform itself, allowed streamers to challenge the gendered structure established byTwitch. Despite being faced with harassment, community building was important to the Trans*streamers. Trans* streamers were more interested in building themselves communities, whilstcis streamers articulated their relationship to their audience in a different way. For example,Junes while fostering a community is still important to him, described his stream as a bar, whichis, to a degree, less community-building focused and more an informal gathering. Sarah, a cis7 A V-tuber is a streamer who uses a virtual avatar instead of a camera to create content.6 Note: B is referred to by both he and she pronouns because that is how he identified.22woman in her early 30s, kept her audience at an arm's-length state, taking care to police anddrive her community in specific ways.Ultimately, gender impacts the interpersonal relationships among streamers and theiraudiences. More particularly, gender identity and performativity intervenes in the interpersonalrelationships between Trans* streamers and their audiences and cis streamers and theirs. ForTrans* and genderqueer streamers, their gender identity made them more visible to the audience,which had its positive and negative consequences. They had to negotiate gendered harassment,Trans*phobia, and mistreatment at the hands of unmoderated audience members. However, theyalso drew on their gender identities to cultivate a community of support for other Trans*streamers and viewers. For the cis women in the study, they employ their own gender identityand performance to safeguard themselves against sexual harassment from cis men. However,they did not draw on their gender identity to gather community to them in the way that Trans*streamers do. The cis men of the study gave very little thought to their gender as they interact inthe space. They did not face the challenges of their cis, Trans*, and non-binary counterparts. Aswe shall see, this indicates a male and cis-privilege, but also alludes to the nature of Twitch as agendered space that upholds the gender binary and hegemonic masculinity.6.2 Gendered Labor on Twitch: The Gamification of GenderInteracting with audiences is a driving force in the subtle forms of gender performativity.Financial success may be tied to similar ideas of hegemonic masculinity and femininity on theplatform, as well as financial status outside of the platform. Considering the nature of Twitch as aunique entertainment platform, performance is a crucial part, but gender performativity takes adifferent tact. In the case of gender performance and performativity, these can be gamified.Gamification is the application of game systems into different non video game scenarios or23domains (Woodcock and Johnson 2018). Gamification is not value free, but is tied more andmore into economic and social contexts especially with digital spaces. Mabel, a cis woman in theUnited States, for example, mentions that as one of her channel point rewards, she will stretch,which, among other things, allows viewers to see below her neckline. Similarly, Sara, mentionedpreviously, uses filters to give her makeup during streams, giving their audience power overchannel points to manipulate the makeup filters to a comical effect.While both Sarah and Mabel theme their channels in less traditional ways regardingfemininity, one with a gothic tomboy aesthetic and the other with a mad scientist aesthetic, theirchannels gamify elements that highlight traditional elements of femininity in the broadersocio-cultural sense. Sarah, by far the most successful streamer of these interviewees, was alsothe closest to traditional standards of beauty (i.e., young, thin, white) and was also financiallysecure outside of the platform, working in a pharmaceutical position alongside contracted work.Compared to the other streamers, she considered the platform a hobby, keeping much moredistance between her and viewers than other streamers while also having 800 followers. With astrong financial stability outside of Twitch, a larger viewership, and being traditionally attractive,Sarah is able to maintain a strong viewership even with a non-traditional, mad scientist style ofpresentation on her channel. However, this is a topic that merits further research.Mark and B, a Latino cis man and a genderqueer Brazilian, respectively, were the twostreamers most interested in pursuing Twitch as a career; they were also faced with economicprecarity, reflecting broader digital labor trends where low-income individuals and people ofcolor are more likely to turn to digital work for their primary source of income (Shade 2014).There are aspects of labor on Twitch that should be interrogated more deeply.24Thus, gender performativity is an important component of gamification and generatingrewards. It is carefully crafted and plays a role in digital labor and income-generation. Yet, thosewho are able to conform to “traditional” gender performativity through their audienceinteractions are more likely to reap the rewards. This is not to say that gender performativity thatdoes not fit neatly into what is constructed as “traditional” cannot be rewarded, but streamersunderstand that they risk losing income or rewards if they push the limits too far. Thus, genderperformativity must be thoughtfully cultivated and is not automatic. How much one can varytheir non-traditional gender performativity depends on the degree of privilege they have atdifferent intersections of their identity, including their socio-economic status. Interviewees whodo not need the income from Twitch, for example, have more flexibility when crafting theirperformance, while those who have less income feel more constraints.6.3. Gender in a Digital Institution: Hegemonic ConstraintsThough Twitch is a strongly cisnormative space, where the streamers mostly stronglyaligned with the hegemonic masculinity/femininity are most likely to have greater success.Multiple streamers made statements attesting to success is based on ideas of hegemonic views ofmasculinity and femininity, reflecting broader understandings of the internet as a digitalinstitution that structures social interaction. Though all the cis streamers did not find their owngender identity to have any influence on their streaming, gender still influenced the way theythought about and interacted with the platform. For example, one of the streamers I interviewed,Mabel, stated, \"Intentionally, no, so unintentionally, I think the fact that I'm a female attractsmore viewers. And I think it's usually just the men who pop in and talk to a female, or maybejust kind of watch a female.\" Sarah says something similar, saying, \" I think maybe new viewerscoming in tend to have a more positive initial impression of me than they maybe would if I were25a dude. But that's probably about it. I haven't really.\" This indicates that female streamers, if theyaren’t written off as a “titty streamer” (Ruberg et al, 2019), may be seen by some (male) viewersas more of novelty, or seen as more worth a watch compared to a male streamer who playssimilar games. It should be noted that Mabel plays shooters, horror games, and older platformers,while Sarah plays more adventure style games. For example, several streamers believe that mendo better on Twitch because men appear to be more competitive and skilled and that there areassumptions about female streamers playing “cozy games” (games focused more on affect,crafting, and building over combat) instead of competitive games, reflecting the broader gameridentity that privileges aggressive masculinity over other forms of “feminine” gaming (Shaw2011, Dargonaki 2018). Junes, a cis man who plays primarily “cozy” games, believes that thecozy gamer category tends to have more queer streamers, more so than first-person shooters,which is often aligned with masculinity. Streaming in this category for Junes has had itsdrawbacks, describing an incident where a random viewer came into his stream to call him ahomophobic slur, leading to Junes timing them out for the channel8. In addition, due to Junes'less masculine channel focus, an outside viewer targeted him for his perceived sexuality.Although Junes is a heterosexual cis man, he was targeted for his channel is focused on a morefeminine style of game, reflecting the marginalized status of femininity within video gameculture (Paaßen et al. 2016) as well as hostility within the video game subculture towards LGBTidentity, real or imagined (Cote 2017, 137).Tags like \"Trans*\" and \"safe space,\" established on Twitch with good intentions, can alsotarget Trans* streamers. Rory knows that putting those tags on his streamer profile makes himmore open to harassment (having received Trans*phobic harassment in the past), but he8 Timing out is a moderation option, where similar to a time out punishment, temporarily removes a viewer for anamount of time.26mentioned that he is yet to be hate raided. Despite these issues, there are systems to mitigatethese issues. The most prominent type of mitigation is moderation, either through the streamer ormoderation, either through A.I. or another individual on stream. Though auto-moderation washelpful for all the streamers involved, some found it would backfire. For example, Junesdescribed a time when his audience was sharing Pokémon Go codes, which are a randomassortment of numbers. One individual could not share their code because it contains the number1488, which was flagged because of those numbers also being an antisemitic dog whistle (ADL2020). B mentioned that as a queer streamer, he and his chat talk frankly about issues ofsexuality and gender throughout streamers. However, this triggers the auto-moderation for audioand chat, censoring the discussion. Even though the auto-moderation is meant to protectstreamers and viewers from harassment, it can affect censoring those it has meant to protect.Harassment occurs between interactions on the platform, between individuals in chat, anindividual towards the streamer, and sometimes a streamer towards an individual. In the lastcase, this is the experience of Streamers like Kat (a Trans* woman in her early 30s) describedabove. In Kat's case, she received jokes about her gender identity from another audiencemember, which received inaction from the streamer she was viewing, leaving her uncomfortable.Sarah relayed her explanation describing a similar situation where an individual in a stream chatshe was viewing was using slurs targeting those with mental disabilities stating,\"Um, I've heard people using the R-word slur to describe other streamers' actions in agame and was disappointed When the streamer did not take any moderation actions toward thatperson. It was kind of an adversarial relationship where the one viewer was like they had allthese badges for being the hype train leader, top bits donator, so they throw a lot of money at thestreamer. So maybe that’s why the streamer felt like they needed to put up with this shittybehavior or something.”This behavior takes the idea of the prosumer, an individual part of an economic system focusedon participation, and flips it around (Pybus 2013). While prosumers are typically a focus of27digital marketers, prosumers in Twitch are those who, by participating more heavily on a stream,can hold power economically over a streamer through donations, bits, and subscriptions.Though harassment on this platform is not strictly gendered, it does have a markedtendency to target gender and sexual identities, like the Trans*phobic harassment experienced byB, Kat, and Rory and the harassment Junes received regarding his (perceived) sexuality. B alsodescribed harassment based on his accent and that other streamers, especially eastern Europeanstreamers, described that harassment as harsher than her own. Harassment is a persistent issue inlive streaming, with women and queer streamers often receiving the most harassment. Thoughduring this research, neither Mabel nor Sarah described any significant harassment targetingthem due to their gender. Harassment may differ based on the size of an individual's stream, butthrough this research, Trans* streamers seem targeted for harassment.Despite the harassment Trans* streamers face, they all found their stream as a chance todevelop a safe community for Trans* viewers. For example, Rory, a Trans* man from the U.K.,incorporates his identity and Trans* identity within his stream, allowing viewers to sharepronouns through an extension, and also uses the tags Trans* and safe space to be morewelcoming while also acknowledging that it puts him in a position to get hate raided.9. B, theV-Tuber from Brazil, uses the same extension to allow his audience to choose their pronouns,avoiding the \"male as default\" attitude of Twitch. Though Kat came to her gender identityseparate from beginning her streaming career but found it presented her a unique opportunitystating,\"I quickly realized how marginalized specifically the Trans*gender community is not just in theU.S., but worldwide. So I decided to put the tag on. I realized that the color scheme had picked9 A raid is when one streamer sends their audience to another streamer as they end a stream, often friends orcollaborators. A hate raid weaponizes this system and often involves bots programmed to spam comments, ofteninvolving hate speech (Twitch.tv. n.d. “How to Use Raids.” Customer Support. Retrieved April 3, 2023(https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-use-raids?language=en_US).28for my stream overlays, and everything was extremely Trans*gender. It's like, I wonder wherethat came from. This is a common thing, but yeah, anyhow, I decided to be open about it becauseI know that for years, decades of my life. I just thought there was something wrong with me andthat something was broken inside. Once I came to the realization and experienced a clarity ofmind that came with accepting and understanding who and what I am, I determined to be very,very public about a process and that identity so that others who may not have acceptance or apositive example of that in their lives and to look and think and be encouraged and not feelalone. So I guess it's my identity as a streamer a little bit.\"Through discovering her Trans* identity, Kat decided to develop her stream as an openand proud space for Trans* people. Though her streaming and her Trans*ition coincidentallystarted around the same time, Kat, like B and Rory, uses their stream to develop a community.However, for streamers like B, who exist within a different context regarding gender identity andgeographical location, care must go into crafting communities. Though B is open about beingTrans* and raised as a woman, he asked his audience not to correct new viewers out of safetyconcerns.Twitch, as a platform, is structured to direct audiences around through tags and raids.Though both features are value-neutral and are meant to find streamers with similar interests andgrow audiences, they are easily weaponized. Tagging is one of the built-in mechanisms ofcommunication and networking on Twitch. Through Twitch's tagging system, streamers tag thetype of content they produce and the specific identities they hold around themselves. The Twitchsystem of tagging was developed after the creation of Peer2Peer, which was created bymarginalized streamers to find streamers of similar backgrounds and experiences moreefficiently. Though the tagging system is very useful for networking, several streamersacknowledged issues with this system. For example, Sarah, an activist for vision impairment invideo games, was frustrated by the \"blind\" tag being overtaken by blind playthroughs, leavingblind and vision-impaired streamers to create a tag to represent their community. Though these29tags were implemented to create a more welcoming and communal space for viewers andstreamers alike, it has also been weaponized as a tool of harassment.In sum, gender is not simply about interpersonal interactions, but is embedded in the verystructure of Twitch. As twitch is a part of the larger institution of the Internet, gender is not onlypoliced by those people in the institutional space, but by the institution itself. Coding,auto-moderation, tagging, even the filters are embedded with a particular understanding ofgender and identity. Twitch structures gender, cisnormativity, and heteronormativity, which isbuilt right into the code and reifies the traditional gender hierarchy. However, Twitch as aninstitutional space, it does not do this evenly. As Twitch evolves, so does its programming,coding, and moderation, even though at its core, site builders constructed twitch with theirunderstanding of gender in mind. Part of these changes or the unevenness of structuring genderon the site itself is through the iterative interaction between streamers at the micro level andmore macro-level institution space. Streamers can draw on tags, filters, and circumventmoderation that Twitch provides to push back, create more inclusive spaces, and challengegender norms. Twitch augments its offerings in response albeit slowly and sometimes indisjointed ways.7. Discussion and ConclusionBecoming a successful streamer on Twitch.tv is tied strongly to ideas of class and gender.I argued that the closer an individual adheres to normative understandings of gender, the morepositive a relationship the individual would have with both the platform and their audience.However, due to automation of most interactions with Twitch, and with most streamers having acore audience, these relationships were generally neutral, though Trans* streamers weremarkedly faced with harassment compared to their cis counterparts. However, to economically30succeed on Twitch, having prior sources of income makes it easier to succeed on the platform,and reflects prior research that digital spaces and digital labor, where individuals are more likelyto have work outside of traditional forms of labor within competitive labor pools (Kane andJasserand 2019, 486). However, for many streamers, personal success is not measured bymonetary success but is defined more interpersonally than economically. For these streamers,live streaming has much more intrinsic than extrinsic value. Though several streamers like Mark,Mabel, and B were interested in streaming as a primary occupation, even the most successfulstreamer, Sarah, saw streaming as a hobby. However, streaming still has a valuable role in theirlives, with community building, expression, or activism being important motivations on theplatform, particularly with Trans* streamers, echoing Freeman and Guo (2020). A focus oncommunity and empowerment instead of audience growth has been seen in prior researchfocusing on women and LGBTQ streamers (Freeman and Wohn 2020). However, this studyshows that community building is a key aspect to Trans* streamers in a way that it is not centralto the cis women interviewed. This provides more nuance to Freeman and Wohn’s (2020)findings. The gendered strategies for coping and combating sexual harassment, sexism, andmisogyny differ among cis-women and Trans* and non-binary streamers because theyexperience those challenges differently.The barriers between the interpersonal, labor, and the technological are often very thin onTwitch with its unique blend of social networking, passion connecting, and video connectionsites (Luttrell and Wallace 2021, 6-7). Through the course of this research, there is still much tolearn about the social significance of Twitch, not only within experiences discussed here, gender,labor, and digital spaces, but also more in-depth research about harassment on the platformseems like a future avenue, considering the emotional, psychological, and sometimes even31physical effects of harassment on the platform. Though this research follows a more substantiveapproach, future research regarding Twitch should also incorporate a theoretical focus. Twitch isa very complex platform, one where rules change constantly, popularity ebbs and flows, andmillions of hours of content are streaming concurrently. It is a platform used worldwide bymillions of people and should have more focus within sociology, like TikTok, Twitter, andFacebook.3210. ReferencesWorks Cited:1. ADL. 2022. “1488.” ADL.

    "abstract": "Twitch.tv is a live entertainment platform where individuals live stream events, including playing video games, playing board and tabletop games, creating art, and more. Twitch has a diverse base of streamers, but Twitch has just begun. The most common approach has focused on cisgender, heterosexual white men in the cases where it has been studied. Though these streamers should be studied in sociology, this focus leaves out the experiences of both cis women and Trans* streamers. This research proposal tries to situate the relationship of Trans* streamers with both the platform and their audience, seeing if these relationships affect their ability to earn income and status in a precarious digital workplace. This study will incorporate a primarily qualitative approach, interviewing cisgender, Transgender, and non-binary streamers about their experiences",
