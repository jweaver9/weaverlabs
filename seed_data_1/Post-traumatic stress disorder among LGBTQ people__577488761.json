Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ) are at increased risk oftraumatization. This systematic review aimed to summarize data regarding the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for LGBTQ people and their subgroups.Methods. Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched until September 2022.Studies reporting a comparative estimation of PTSD among LGBTQ population and the gen-eral population (i.e., heterosexual/cisgender), without restrictions on participants’ age andsetting for the enrolment,were identified.Meta-analyseswere based onodds ratio (ORand95%confidence intervals [CI]), estimated through inverse variance models with random effects.Results. The review process led to the selection of 27 studies, involving a total of 31,903LGBTQ people and 273,842 controls, which were included in the quantitative synthesis.Overall, LGBTQ people showed an increased risk of PTSD (OR: 2.20 [95% CI: 1.85; 2.60]),although there was evidence of marked heterogeneity in the estimate (I2 = 91%). AmongLGBTQ subgroups, transgender people showed the highest risk of PTSD (OR: 2.52 [95% CI:2.22; 2.87]) followed by bisexual people (OR: 2.44 [95% CI: 1.05; 5.66]), although these com-parisons are limited by the lack of data for other sexual and gender minorities, such as intersexpeople. Interestingly, the risk of PTSD for bisexual people was confirmed also considering les-bian and gay as control group (OR: 1.44 [95% CI: 1.07; 1.93]). The quality of the evidence waslow.Conclusions. LGBTQ people are at higher risk of PTSD compared with their cisgender/het-erosexual peers. This evidence may contribute to the public awareness on LGBTQ mentalhealth needs and suggest supportive strategies as well as preventive interventions (e.g., sup-portive programs, counselling, and destigmatizing efforts) as parts of a tailored health-careplanning aimed to reduce psychiatric morbidity in this at-risk population.IntroductionDespite continuing actions put to achieve social recognition and legal rights, in many areas ofthe world, sexual minorities are still highly exposed to traumatization (International Lesbian,Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, 2015). A growing body of evidence underlinedthat the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ) are more exposed totraumatic events in life, including hate crimes, intimate partner violence and sexual assaults(Mongelli et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2010; Seelman et al., 2017; Trombetta and Rollè, 2022;Walters et al., 2013). Also, a higher prevalence of childhood abuse was found among sexualminority children, which accounted for up to half of mental health disparities by sexual orien-tation, especially for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Roberts et al., 2012). According tothe diagnostic criteria, PTSD is developed in response to events that overpower the adaptativeability of the person, and the listed traumatic experiences entail being directly exposed to death,threatened death or severe personal damage, including physical or sexual assault (Long et al.,2008). The core clinical features of PTSD are that people tend to re-experience the traumaticevent intrusively, with detrimental consequences on personal functioning and high psycholog-ical suffering (Pai et al., 2017; Sareen, 2014). In addition, PTSD revealed as a multidimensionaldisorder, with different neurobiological underpinnings, including alterations of the sympatheticnervous system (De Berardis et al., 2015, 2020). Over the years, the literature identified as trau-matic also less intense situations, but for which the traumatic potential consists in the systematicrepetition of the experience, such as being persecuted and discriminated against, especially forinvariable personal characteristics such as race, religious beliefs, gender and sexual orientationhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796023000586 Published online by Cambridge University Press2 Marchi et al.(Alessi et al., 2013; Auxéméry, 2018; Keating and Muller, 2020;Livingston et al., 2022; Solomon et al., 2021). The Minority StressModel proposed by Meyer (2003), provides a theoretical frame-work for understanding the ways in which repeated traumas canlead to an increased prevalence of mental disorders among sexualminorities. Research showed that sexualminorities’ minority stresscan lead to emotional dysregulation, social and interpersonal con-flicts and negative cognition that can mediate the association withpoor mental health outcomes (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Marchi et al.,2022a; Mongelli et al., 2019). Moreover, internalized homopho-bia has been shown to predict PTSD symptom severity in sexualminorities with a history of trauma (Gold et al., 2011). LGBTQgroups are also at increased risk of suicidal behaviours, and thathas been hypothesized to be a consequence of the experience ofrepeated discrimination (Livingston et al., 2022; Marchi et al.,2022a). Therefore, recognizing and addressing PTSD may have animpact on psychopathology translationally.Our study aimed to explore the risk of PTSD in the LGBTQpopulation compared with non-LGBTQ individuals, independentof the type or intensity of the trauma towhich individualsmay havebeen exposed. The secondary goal was to detail the risk of PTSDamong different subgroups such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans-gender, intersex and queer individuals, compared with cisgenderheterosexual ones.MethodsThis systematic review andmeta-analysiswas performed accordingto the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al., 2021). The protocol ofthis study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022354616).Data sources and search strategyWe searched the PubMed (Medline), Scopus, PsycINFO andEMBASE databases until September 30, 2022, using the strategyoutlined in the Supplementary Table S1 of the Appendix. With theaim to maximize the number of studies included, no restrictionsregarding the language of publication or publication date were set.Eligibility criteriaWe included observational studies reporting a comparative estima-tion of rate of PTSD among the LGBTQ population vs. the generalpopulation (i.e., heterosexual cisgender—controls), without anyrestriction on participants’ age or setting of the enrolment.We excluded reviews, case reports, case series and studies thatdid not report data for the measurements of the outcome in thetargeted population. We only included studies published in peer-reviewed journals, excluding conference abstracts and disserta-tions. If data from the same sample were published in multipleworks, we considered only that study reporting more exhaustiveinformation. Sample overlap was ruled out through a careful checkof the registration codes aswell as the place and year(s) of sampling.Terms and definitionsLGBTQ status was defined as self-reported. PTSD diagnosis hadto be defined according to standard operational diagnostic criteria(i.e., according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders [DSM] (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) orthe International Classification of Diseases [ICD] (World HealthOrganization, 2018)). We also included studies where PTSD diag-nosis was made according to the score on validated psychometrictools, operationalized to ICD or DSM definition.Data collection and extractionFour authors (MM, DU, EDM and AT) preliminarily reviewedtitles and abstracts of retrieved articles. The initial screening wasfollowed by the analysis of full texts to check compliance withinclusion/exclusion criteria. A standardized form was used fordata extraction. Information concerning the year of publication,country, setting, name of the study/cohort, characteristics of studyparticipants (sample size, age, percentages of men and women),LGBTQ status and PTSD rates among the LGBTQ groups andthe controls were collected by two authors (MM and PG) inde-pendently. Extraction sheets for each study were cross-checkedfor consistency, and any disagreement was resolved by discussionwithin the research group.Statistical analysesThe meta-analysis was performed by comparing PTSD ratesbetween controls vs. overall LGBTQ people and controls vs. eachLGBTQ subgroup. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confi-dence intervals (95% CIs) were generated using inverse variancemodels with random effects (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986). Theresults were summarized using forest plots. Standard Q testsand the I2 statistic (i.e., the percentage of variability in preva-lence estimates attributable to heterogeneity rather than sam-pling error or chance, with values of I2 ≥ 75% indicating highheterogeneity) were used to assess between-study heterogeneity(Higgins and Thompson, 2002). Leave-one-out analysis and meta-regression were performed to examine sources of between-studyheterogeneity.If themeta-analysis includedmore than 10 studies (Sterne et al.,2011), funnel plot analysis and the Egger test were performedto test for publication bias. The Egger test quantifies bias cap-tured in the funnel plot analysis using the value of effect sizesand their precision (i.e., the standard errors) and assumes thatthe quality of study conduct is independent of study size. If anal-yses showed a significant risk of publication bias, the ‘trim andfill’ method was employed to estimate the number of missingstudies and the adjusted effect size (Duval and Tweedie, 2000;Sterne et al., 2008; Sutton, 2000; Terrin et al., 2003). All theanalyses were performed in R (RStudio Team, 2021) using metaand metafor packages (Balduzzi et al., 2019; Viechtbauer, 2010).Statistical tests were two-sided and used a significance threshold ofp-value < 0.05.Risk of bias assessment and the GRADEBias risk in the included studies was independently assessed by fivereviewers (AT, DU, EDM, PG and EA), using the Cochrane riskof bias tool (Higgins et al., 2011). Each item on the risk of biasassessmentwas scored as high, low or unclear, and theGRADE toolwas used to assess the overall certainty of evidence (Schünemannet al., 2013).

The selectedstudies were conducted in four countries: US (n = 24; 88.9%),Australia, Brazil and Kenya (n = 1 each; 3.7%). All the studiesincluded were published in the last 20 years. Data collection begunafter 2000 for most of the studies (n = 20; 74.1%), before 2000 forthree studies (11.1%), and not reported in four studies (14.8%).PTSD was defined according to DSM (n = 16; 59.3%), ICD (n = 3;11.1%), self-reported (n = 3; 11.1%) and validated psychometricscales (n = 5; 18.5%). Sample weights ranged from 6.3% to 1.3%.All study characteristics are summarized in Table 1.Narrative synthesis of the type of trauma reported across thestudiesBesides PTSD diagnosis, 16 (59.3%) studies also collected infor-mation about the type of trauma experienced by participants.However, it is worth noting that the studies investigated trau-matic experiences without necessarily establishing a temporal orhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796023000586 Published online by Cambridge University Press4 Marchi et al.Table1.CharacteristicsoftheincludedstudiesAuthor,yearCountryDateStudydesignNLG(%females)NB(%females)NT(%females)NotherSM(%females)NLGBTQ+(%females)Ncontrols(%females)Females(%)Age,mean(range)Albaetal.,2022Australia2017Cross-sectional756(32.1)NRNRNR756(32.1)NRNRNR(NR)Bettisetal.,2020USA2017−2019Cross-sectional38125NR1517826657.514.7(NR)Brewertonetal.,2022USA2017−2019Cross-sectional2969NR2912741596.725.0(NR)Brownetal.2016USA1996−2013CohortNRNR5135NR513515,4053055.8(NR)Burnsetal.,2015USA2009−2013LongitudinalCohort32996NR24449NR018.9(NR)Caceresetal.,2019USA2010−2012LongitudinalCohort323137NR875470100NR(18−75)Careyetal.,2022USA2014−2016Cross-sectional1824(64)1614(59.6)NRNR3438(61.9)93,492(28)29.240(NR)Evans-Polceetal.,2020USA2012−2013Cross-sectionalNRNRNRNR320332,593NRNR(≥18)Flentjeetal.,2016USA2015Cross-sectional100(56)88(75)49(67.3)54(38.9)242(59.1)714(27)35.141.8(NR)Haoetal.,2021USA2017−2018Cross-sectional26253256442821.7(NR)Harperetal.,2021KenyaNRCross-sectional1962506216524NRNRNR(≥18)Hatzenbuehleretal.,2009USA2004−2005RetrospectiveCohortNRNRNRNR577(51.3)34,076(52.1)NRNR(≥25)Hollowayetal.,2021USA2017−2018Cross-sectionalNRNR5818724529529.827.7(NR)Jefferyetal.,2021USA2015Cross-sectional424(73.6)439(71.7)NRNR86313,542(35.3)37.6NR(NR)Lehavotetal.2014USA2013Cross-sectional20955NRNR26444210049.8(NR)Livingstonetal.,2022USA1999−2021CohortNRNR9995NR999529,98535.5NR(NR)Lucasetal.,2018USA2014−2015Cross-sectionalNRNRNRNR11033039.1NR(≥18)McDonaldetal.,2020USA2016Cross-sectionalNRNRNRNR67(56.7)573(23.1)26.6NR(≥18)Mustanskietal.,2010USA2007−2008Cross-sectional1527020NR246NR50.818.3(NR)Robertsetal.,2012USA2007LongitudinalCohort196172NRNR368782862.8NR(19−27)Rodriguez-Seijasetal.,2019USA2012−2013Cross-sectional581581NRNR116232,42556.3NR(18−90)Schefteretal.,2022USA2017−2020Cross-sectional1481NR2237910060(NR)Terraetal.,2022BrazilNRCross-sectional6015191221124147.8NR(NR)Walukevich-Dienstetal.,2019USANRCross-sectional1331NR24639310020.7(NR)Wangetal.,2021USA2000−2012CohortNRNR2890(30.9)NR2890(30.9)8670(6.3)12.4NR(≥18)Weissetal.,2015USA1995−2007Cross-sectional3857NR1410936810036.1(NR)Whitbecketal.,2004USANRLongitudinalCohortNRNRNRNR6336656.317.4(NR)Abbreviations:LG:lesbianandgay;B:bisexual;T:transgender;SM:othersexualminorities;USA:UnitedStatesofAmerica;NR:notreported.https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796023000586 Published online by Cambridge University PressEpidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences 5Figure 2. Forest plot of PTSD among LGBTQ people compared with controls (heterosexual or cisgender).etiological association with the current PTSD status; rather theyoften reported that information seemingly for descriptive pur-poses. The reported type of trauma consisted of childhood mal-treatment or adverse childhood experiences in three studies, sexualabuse in five studies, interpersonal violence and sexual and vio-lence related to gender minorities in three studies and a cancerdiagnosis in one study. Two studies examined violence experiencedduring both childhood and adulthood, while two veteran studiesdid not specify the type of traumatic experience, although it is rea-sonable to assume exposure to military and war-related trauma inthese cases. For a more comprehensive overview of the exposureto traumatic experiences across the studies, see SupplementaryTable S2.Analysis of PTSD rate among LGBTQ and controlsTwenty-two studies (81.5%) reported outcome data about PTSDamong LGBTQ and controls. As displayed in Fig. 2, LGBTQpeople showed an increased risk of PTSD compared withmatched non-LGBTQcontrols, thoughwith significant evidence ofbetween-study heterogeneity (pooledOR: 2.20 [95%CI: 1.85; 2.60];I2 = 91%; p< 0.001).Analysis of PTSD rate among lesbian and gay and controlsFour (14.8%) studies detailed data on PTSD for the lesbian andgay subgroups.Meta-analyses indicated that lesbian and gay peopledisplayed increased risk of PTSD (pooled OR: 1.96 [95% CI: 1.13;3.39]), though the estimate was affected by significant between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 93%; p< 0.001).The results are displayedin Fig. 3.Furthermore, two studies (7.4%) compared the risk of PTSDamong lesbian and gay: one study detected significant increasedrisk for lesbian, the other did not find significant differencesbetween the two groups. The pooled estimate was indicatingincreased risk for lesbian than gay, but the CIs crossed zero (pooledOR: 1.79 [95% CI: 0.74; 4.33]), and there was evidence of highbetween-study heterogeneity (I2 = 89%; p < 0.001). The resultsare displayed in the Supplementary Figure S1.Analysis of PTSD rate among bisexual and controlsFour studies (14.8%) detailed data on PTSD for the bisexualsubgroup. Meta-analyses showed that bisexual people displayedincreased risk of PTSD (pooled OR: 2.44 [95% CI: 1.05; 5.66]),with significant between-study heterogeneity affecting the estimate(I2 = 95%; p< 0.001). The results are displayed in Fig. 4.Analysis of PTSD rate among lesbian and gay and bisexualSeven studies (25.9%) provided data on PTSD rate among les-bian, gay and bisexual. Meta-analysis of the comparison of thePTSD risk among the two groups showed increased risk for bisex-ual than lesbian and gay (pooled OR: 1.44 [95% CI: 1.07; 1.93]).The between-study heterogeneity was moderate, though statisti-cally significant (I2 = 61%; p = 0.02). The results are displayed inSupplementary Figure S2.Analysis of PTSD rate among transgender and controlsSeven studies (25.9%) reported outcome data about PTSD amongtransgender and cisgender controls. As displayed in Fig. 5, trans-gender people showed an increased risk of PTSD compared withmatched cisgender controls, though with significant evidence ofbetween-study heterogeneity (pooled OR: 2.52 [95% CI: 2.22;2.87]; I2 = 79%; p< 0.001).https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796023000586 Published online by Cambridge University Press6 Marchi et al.Figure 3.

Forest plot of PTSD among T people compared with heterosexual controls.Analysis of PTSD rate among queer and controlsSince only one study (3.7%) provided outcome data about queerand controls, meta-analysis was not performed on that outcome,even though the study reported an increased risk for the queergroup (OR: 1.84 [95% CI: 1.04; 3.25]).Publication bias andmeta-regressionThere was no evidence of publication bias in the primary estimateas shown by Egger’s test p-value > 0.05 and by the funnel plotsdisplayed in the Supplementary Figure S3.Leave-one-out analysis, in which the meta-analysis of PTSDamong LGBTQ and controls was serially repeated after the exclu-sion of each study, showed that irrelevant changes in the pooledestimate were obtained by excluding each one study. When thestudy from Flentje et al. (Flentje et al., 2016) was excluded fromthe analysis, there was a decrease in the amount of heterogene-ity, which, however, was not statistically significant because thevalue of I2 = 76% still indicated high between-study heterogeneity.Therefore, there was no evidence of significant outlier effect playedby any of the study (leave-one-out data available in SupplementaryTable S3).Meta-regression analyseswere performed on the following vari-ables, potentially associated with heterogeneity: (1) the percentageof females in the total sample; (2) the mean age of participants;(3) the country where the study was conducted; (4) assessmentof PTSD applied; and (5) the year of publication. In the univari-able meta-regressionmodel the variables that resulted significantlycorrelated with the variance in the risk of PTSD were the coun-try where the study was performed (USA, B: 0.786 [95% CI: 0.611;0.960]) and the PTSD assessment applied (DSM or ICD, B: 0.996[95% CI: 0.779; 1.21]; validated psychometric scale, B: −0.402[95% CI: −0.721; −0.084]). Univariable meta-regression results aredisplayed in Supplementary Table S4.GRADE of the evidenceA summary on the risk of bias in all 27 trials is reported in theSupplementary Figures S4 and S5, along with an assessment of thequality of the evidence (Supplementary Table S5). In the GRADEsystem, the evidence from observational studies is initially set tohttps://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796023000586 Published online by Cambridge University PressEpidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences 7low, there are then criteria that can be used either to downgrade orupgrade (see further information in the Supplementary Material).The quality of the evidence was rated low for the main analysis ofLGBTQ vs. controls. For the secondary analyses, the evidence wasrated from low to very low.DiscussionThis systematic review andmeta-analysis aimed to describe the riskof PTSD among LGBTQ people. Our results indicate that LGBTQpeople are at increased risk of PTSD compared to matched non-LGBTQ controls. These findings confirm the relationship betweensexual variant status and exposure to trauma (InternationalLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, 2015;Livingston et al., 2022; Marchi et al., 2022a; Walters et al., 2013).For example, violence provoked by the same partner and sexualassault in adulthood are disproportionately more prevalent amongminorities of sexual orientation (Trombetta and Rollè, 2022), andindividuals with minority sexual orientation reported a high fre-quency, severity and persistence of physical and sexual abusesduring childhood (Roberts et al., 2012). Interestingly, researchevidence on the psychological consequences of the exposure totrauma, including adverse childhood experience, are not limitedto PTSD (Elkrief et al., 2021; Marchi et al., 2022b, 2020). In thisperspective, the association between the sexual variant status andexperiences of traumatization may be relevant also for other formsof psychopathology. Intersectionality may be another appropri-ate model for understanding the different impact of trauma onLGBTQ people. In our review, we included six studies conductedon samples of veterans (Brown and Jones, 2016; Carey et al., 2022;Holloway et al., 2021; Jeffery et al., 2021; Livingston et al., 2022;McDonald et al., 2020), all showing that LGBTQ veterans are atincreased risk of PTSD compared to their non-LGBTQpeers, inde-pendent of the experience of traumatization to which they mayhave been exposed. Such higher risk of PTSD has been observedalso in other LGBTQ people belonging to vulnerable populations,such as with HIV or part of racial and ethnic minorities (Glynnet al., 2021). For these populations, treatment seeking and adher-ence are still a challenge, and suffering from mental health prob-lems, such as PTSD, may be playing as a mediator (Marchi et al.,2022c; Oni et al., 2019).Although the comparison of the PTSD risk between the sex-ual and gender minority groups was limited by the lack of datafrom some less studied populations, such as intersex, our data sug-gest that among LGBTQ groups, the highest risk of PTSD wasfound for transgender people, followed by bisexuals. This is con-sistent with previous evidence estimating increased risk of inter-personal violence for transgender people, as well as higher risk ofdepression, anxiety, substance use and suicidality (Valentine andShipherd, 2018). Research on bisexual individuals, instead, sug-gested that they may be potentially excluded from LGBTQ com-munity initiatives, due to the stereotypes according to which bisex-uals are promiscuous or that bisexuality is ‘just a phase’. Indeed,from a social perspective, bisexuality—and to some extent alsointersexuality—challenges binary thinking andnormative assump-tions. Invisibility and lack of community support could explainthe higher incidence of mental health problems, including PTSD(Baams et al., 2015). Embracing an ethical perspective able toaccount for fluidity and multiplicity, such as queer ethics, mightcreate a more inclusive framework that accounts for the expe-riences of all members of the LGBTQ communities (Däumer,1992).By looking at the contribution of each study in the analyses, itis possible to observe that the studies from Flentje et al. (Flentjeet al., 2016) and Mustanski et al. (Mustanski et al., 2010) providedestimates that were less coherent with the others. This can be dueto the sampling strategies implemented: Mustanski et al. enrolleda sample made only of sexual minority individuals and observed asmall number of cases of PTSD; Flentje et al. made comparison ofPTSD rates by sexual orientation or by gender identity; therefore,the comparison of PTSD risk by sexual orientation could includealso transgender individuals.This intuition is supported by the factthat the comparison between transgender and cisgender providedby Flentje et al. was coherent with the others. In addition, the sam-ple by Flentje et al. was made of homeless people, which is alreadya population with relevant vulnerabilities for mental health. Thisis supported also by the results of another study included in thisreview and conducted on a sample of homeless people (Hao et al.,2021) providing estimates with CI crossing 1. Consequently, theestimate of higher risk of PTSD for transgender homeless com-pared to cisgender homeless people provided by Flentje et al. isconsistent with the intersectionality model proposed above in thissection. The analysis of the forest plot of the primary compari-son showed substantial between-study heterogeneity. Despite this,leave-one-out analysis did not detect significant outlier effects.Univariable meta-regression found that the pooled estimate ofPTSD risk was affected by the country, although with much imbal-ance in the distribution of the classes (i.e., 21 out of 22 studieswere conducted in USA) and the assessment of PTSD applied.Specifically, studies assessing PTSD by applying diagnostic man-uals criteria (i.e., DSM or ICD) could provide lower effect size forthe pooled odds of PTSD among LGBTQ. This is consistent withprevious evidence of only moderate diagnostic agreement betweenthe systems used, with likely stricter definition of PTSD appliedin the diagnostic manuals (Elmose Andersen et al., 2022; Murphyet al., 2017). Nevertheless, the high heterogeneity detected wouldnot seem to be a limitation but a possible indicator of the trend ofPTSD in LGBTQ people through time and in its possible declina-tion across different samples. The low detection of publication biasseems to support this interpretation.LimitationsThe present study yielded robust findings; however, it should beinterpreted considering some limitations. First, the heterogene-ity on the PTSD assessment used in the studies. Most of thestudies considered DSM and ICD definitions of PTSD, which con-sisted, respectively, in the presence of a traumatic event involvingexposure to real or threatened death, serious injury or sexual vio-lence (criterion A of DSM) or a protracted response to a stressfulevent or situation of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophicnature, which is likely to cause distress to almost anybody (ICD).Evaluations tailored on specific stress experienced by LGBTQ peo-ple (e.g., consistent with the Minority Stress Model) are lacking.These could lead to more accurate understanding of the risk ofpost-traumatic stress to which this population is exposed. Second,some studies included in the final selection did not provide allinformation about the sample composition (i.e., four studies didnot report participants age and two studies did not report the sexassigned at birth of participants). This lack of information mighthave affected the results of meta-regression. Third, although theEgger test did not detect publication bias in any of the analyses, thefunnel plot of the primary comparison seems to suggest that publi-cation bias might be present. That may be due to between-studyhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796023000586 Published online by Cambridge University Press8 Marchi et al.heterogeneity, which can give that plotting especially for thosestudies with large standard error. In addition, the number of thestudies included in the subgroups meta-analyses was <10, whichwas not enough to inform about publication bias (Sterne et al.,2011). Finally, we could not achieve our initial aim to detail PTSDrisk for each LGBTQ group (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgenderand queer) because many studies did not consider these separatedgroups. In addition, there is limited research with enough par-ticipants that could be used to validate these findings for othersexual and gender minority groups, such as intersex people. Thereis an important need for international research to explore this areafurther.Implications for research and practiceTraumatization and post-traumatic stress among sexual minoritiesare unaddressed issues. Critically, the concept of trauma should beinvestigated also beyond that considered by the diagnostic systems,especially for minority populations, such as LGBTQ. For instance,the literature is highlighting the negative effect of repeated inter-personal microaggressions. These are verbal expressions, attitudesand behaviours, which, intentionally or unintentionally, commu-nicate hostile, derogatory, negative, prejudicial and offensive mes-sages towards members of minority groups (Johnston and Nadal,2010; Nadal et al., 2016). The prefix micro does not describe thequality or the impact of these aggressions but rather the subtle wayin which this type of discrimination occurs, making microaggres-sions very difficult to recognize, study and demonstrate, eludingthe available diagnostic criteria. Microaggression may be consid-ered benign or harmless by the perpetrator, with the risk to becomepervasive and automatic in daily interactions. Research has shownthat experiencing microaggressions can damage people’s mentalhealth and lead to chronic stress, depression, anxiety and lowself-esteem (Flentje et al., 2020; Nicholson et al., 2022).On a primary prevention level, programs and guidelines shouldbe developed and employed in violence prevention to strengthenprotective factors and foster resilience. Such efforts should beintensified for LGBTQ people with the aim of reducing minoritystress and the barriers to disclosure and seeking help among thevictims. For example, psychoeducation campaigns aimed at reduc-ing victim-blaming and promoting intervening behaviours bybystanders has shown to be an effective mean of preventing inter-personal violence in societal settings (Fischer et al., 2011; Wijayaet al., 2022). Also, awareness and education campaigns, associatedwith severe sentences for sexual minority-related crimes, couldbe valid responses to reduce the risk of violence and increase thesecurity of LGBTQ people. Arguably, intersectional analysis wouldmake it possible to give a modern reading of social discriminationphenomena. Embracing this would allow better understanding ofsystemic, institutional and social disparities contributing to theexperiences of discrimination of the LGBTQ communities (Bendlet al., 2015).Supplementary material.

    "abstract": "Aims: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ) are at increased risk of traumatization. This systematic review aimed to summarize data regarding the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for LGBTQ people and their subgroups. Methods: Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched until September 2022. Studies reporting a comparative estimation of PTSD among LGBTQ population and the general population (i.e., heterosexual/cisgender), without restrictions on participants' age and setting for the enrolment, were identified. Meta-analyses were based on odds ratio (OR and 95% confidence intervals [CI]), estimated through inverse variance models with random effects. Results: The review process led to the selection of 27 studies, involving a total of 31,903 LGBTQ people and 273,842 controls, which were included in the quantitative synthesis. Overall, LGBTQ people showed an increased risk of PTSD (OR: 2.20 [95% CI: 1.85; 2.60]), although there was evidence of marked heterogeneity in the estimate (I2&nbsp;=&nbsp;91%). Among LGBTQ subgroups, transgender people showed the highest risk of PTSD (OR: 2.52 [95% CI: 2.22; 2.87]) followed by bisexual people (OR: 2.44 [95% CI: 1.05; 5.66]), although these comparisons are limited by the lack of data for other sexual and gender minorities, such as intersex people. Interestingly, the risk of PTSD for bisexual people was confirmed also considering lesbian and gay as control group (OR: 1.44 [95% CI: 1.07; 1.93]). The quality of the evidence was low. Conclusions: LGBTQ people are at higher risk of PTSD compared with their cisgender/heterosexual peers. This evidence may contribute to the public awareness on LGBTQ mental health needs and suggest supportive strategies as well as preventive interventions (e.g., supportive programs, counselling, and destigmatizing efforts) as parts of a tailored health-care planning aimed to reduce psychiatric morbidity in this at-risk population",
