Occasional Paper Series | 1Missing Persons’ Report! Where are the Transgender Characters in Children’s Picture Books? Ashley Lauren Sullivan and Laurie Lynne Urraro  When thinking about the factors that impact early childhood education, we invariably reflect on how the curriculum represents (or fails to represent) issues of  gender, and specifically how gender is portrayed in classroom picture books. What role does reading curricula play in relation to gender? Does the corpus of  books available in the classrooms provide an accurate representation of  the gender spectrum? That is, does the elementary classroom book selection include non-heteronormative gender ontologies? What trends or patterns of  gender emerge in the picture books selected for the early childhood/elementary education classroom? These queries drove our research to investigate the holdings of  picture books for children ages three to eight that contain characters who exhibit a range of  gender identities. We specifically queried what, if  any, transgender characters appear in these texts. Because there are 56.6 million Spanish-speaking individuals1 living in the United States as of  2015 (U.S. Census Bureau), and, 3.4% of  Spanish-speaking individuals identify as LGBTQ, we found it imperative to consider the number of  texts available in both English and Spanish (Gates & Newport, 2012) and those that are bilingual.  Additionally, regarding LGBTQ issues that affect Spanish-speaking individuals, to quote Samantha Rosenthal in LGBT Hispanics Juggle Heritage and Sexuality, “According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Spanish-speaking individuals constitute 17 percent of  the U.S. population as of  July 2013, making them the largest ethnic or racial minority. It is estimated that by the year 2060 that proportion will increase to 31 percent. Among the total population, a report from the UCLA Williams Institute found that an estimated 1.4 million U.S. Spanish-speaking adults—or 4.3 percent—are LGBT.” Our overarching research project seeks to answer the question: In what manner are English- and Spanish-speaking trans characters represented in children’s books? 1 For the purposes of this paper, we shall use the term ‘Spanish-speaking individuals’ instead of ‘Hispanic individuals’, due to the negative impression the latter term often connotes.2 | Bank Street College of EducationLGBTQ Issues in Education Although there is increasingly more acceptance of  LGBTQ issues in educational curricula today, transgender characters continue to escape representation in picture books (Naidoo, 2012). This is the case not only with children’s books written in English, but also in Spanish. To date, there are very few trans characters in picture books in English, almost none in Spanish, and no bilingual English-Spanish children’s picture books. Research tells us that a lack of  representation of  minority groups in picture books is harmful to the children who belong to that group (Hamilton, Anderson, Broaddus & Young, 2006). Our study aims to query this lacuna, in order to describe a phenomenon that we refer to as the “spectral status” of  trans characters in children’s bilingual picture books. We gathered over 60 English, Spanish, and English-Spanish children’s picture books and examined them critically for multiple components, such as instantiations of  trans characters, plot arcs, characters’ gender identities and expressions, character race, and the function of  other characters present in the texts.This paper discusses our findings with regard to the types of  transgender individuals present in children’s books, what their roles were within the texts, and what the overarching ramifications of  inclusion in these texts were for readers2. Our project ultimately seeks to promote understanding of  and sensitivity toward multiple gender ontologies, particularly with regard to trans characters, in the hopes of  advancing societal acceptance and approval of  such gender identities and expressions.LGBTQ Facts and StatisticsOne in 500 children in the U.S. identify as ‘transgender’ (Brill & Pepper, 2008) and 1.4 million U.S. Spanish-speaking adults identifying as LGBTQ (Gates, 2011). With this upsurge of  out LGBTQ individuals, there has been an expressed need for recognition of  such individuals in children’s books. Research as early as the 1970s (Ashton, 1978) has demonstrated that stereotypical presentations of  gender in children’s books negatively influence readers’ behaviors and attitudes (Ashton, 1978; Schau & Scott, 1984; Anderson & Hamilton, 2005; Hamilton, Anderson, Broaddus, & Young, 2006). Over the last forty years, very little research has been devoted to LGBTQ youth of  color, and even less to transgender youth of  color (Cahill & Holmes, 2004) indicating that research that identifies such deficiencies and seeks to ameliorate them is a priority. 2 The thrust of this paper is to present the data from our findings which pointedly signal certain conclusions when it comes to the make-up of children’s picture books that contain non-normative gender ontologies. These findings will be discussed later in this paper.Occasional Paper Series | 3Theoretical Underpinnings of  LGBTQ OntologiesWhile society has historically pressured children to arrive at conclusions about their gender, “young children are still actively in the process of  constructing these concepts” (Casper & Schultz, 1999). LGBTQ youth have faced a great many obstacles. For example, there is little acknowledgement of  trans youth in school curricula and daily education (Singh & Burnes, 2009). LGBTQ youth at school are two times as likely to be bullied than their heterosexual counterparts, often times are more harshly disciplined by schools, and are at increased risk for issues with mental health, truancy, and attaining higher education (GLSEN Survey, 2017). As a result of  school-related difficulties, LGBTQ youth are two times as likely to be placed in juvenile detention, with 20% of  those in the juvenile delinquent system identifying as LGBTQ and 3.2 million LGBTQ youth at risk for ending up in the juvenile and criminal justice systems (GLSEN Survey, 2017). Transgender children are particularly likely to experience these difficulties due to heterosexist worldviews and the influence of  rigid gender role dichotomies that do not allow for gender variations (Baker, 2002; DePalma & Atkinson, 2009). Nonetheless, with a higher level of  societal tolerance than ever before, more young people are able to identify with and embrace identities that are non-normative, non-binary, or queer. One of  the theoretical underpinnings that helps to elucidate understanding of  a more fluid gender ontology is queer theory. Emerging in the 1990s, queer theory arose from postmodern theory in response to socio-political currents and events in the previous decades as well as psychological and psycho-social studies of  the self. From queer theory, we have gained a deeper understanding of  the fluidity and socially constructed nature of  gender. Postmodernists such as Judith Butler (2006), Monique Wittig (1992), and Kate Bornstein (1994) stress the importance of  shifting interest in signification from the middle to the margins, where interstitial gender ontologies are located and negotiated. Such theories of  gender have made it possible to explain and argue for non-cisgender subjectivities that do not always subscribe to the heterosexual binaries in society. For our project, we are especially interested in the tenets of  queer theory that view the subject not as biologically predetermined but socially constructed, meaning that bodies are open to social forces and currents that act upon them, and that there is no one definable or static means by which bodies can or should be defined—they are multiple, varied, and diverse.4 | Bank Street College of EducationActualizing our project: From book collection to data analysis (see Appendix)In the summer/fall of  2015, we sought to locate all existing Spanish, English, and bilingual Spanish/English picture books for 3- to 8-year-old children containing transgender characters. We began with a search on Amazon.com and a basic Google search. We utilized a list of  LGBTQ books located in the Rainbow Family Collections text (Naidoo, 2012). From the lists of  LGBTQ books, we selected only the picture books that contained transgender characters. We also gathered information about independently published books from transgender support groups on social media. Upon completion of  these searches, we had a short list of  texts in English, and none in Spanish. Although we believe that we located all books that exist in English, we acknowledge that there may be books that we did not find. However, if  we were unable to locate them with all of  our connections and resources, it would probably be even more difficult for a young child or a parent without university resources to find them.We remained curious about whether any Spanish-language picture books contained transgender characters. As we could not locate any in the United States, we began contacting bookstores and libraries in progressive cities in Spain. This search yielded little, but led us to believe that we had located all books in Spain on this topic. At the conclusion of  our search, we had located 65 texts. We finished our project in October of  2015. Any books published after that date were not included in our study.Initial Data Collection Using inductive content analysis (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008), we categorized data from the books using an Excel spreadsheet. We began with basic, demographic categories. These included: title of  the book, publication year, author, language in which the text was written, assumed biological sex of  main character/s, gender identity of  main character/s (i.e., one’s internal cognitive and emotive identification with a particular gender), and gender expression of  main character/s  or the external ways in which characters express their gender. Occasional Paper Series | 5Identification of  ThemesThen we sat together and read the books. We noticed some common plot themes. As these themes emerged, we incorporated associated categories into our data collection. The following areas were examined: whether or not the characters were human; the level of  support (supportive, non-supportive, bullying, eventual acceptance) of  parents, peers, and siblings; whether the character demonstrated a special talent or saved the day before being accepted; and whether there was a medical professional present to explain the main character’s gender transition to others and encourage support for this transition (thus instantiating what we refer to as the ‘hero narrative”). Finding a Rainbow: Categorizing the Characters We acknowledge the richness and complexity of  the gender spectrum (Bornstein & Bergman, 2010). Interestingly, the books we analyzed likewise depicted characters occupying different loci on this spectrum of  gender. This was surprising, as we had not imagined how varied the characters’ genders would be. Four major trends emerged with regard to gender identity of  the characters in the 65 books. We identified one group of  characters as “non-binary,” referring to a proclivity towards items and/or interests that are usually associated with a gender that is not assigned to them at birth. However, these individuals appear comfortable in their assigned birth gender, as indicated by utilizing names/pronouns/attire typically associated with their birth gender. An example of  a text with non-binary characters is In Christina’s Toolbox by Dianne Homan (1981), in which a young girl, Christina, enjoys making functional objects such as a bird feeder with tools. For example, “Christina loved to work with things in her toolbox. She could lift the smooth wooden lid and see her shiny tools inside ready to help her build things and fix things” (p. 4). Twenty-seven (42%) of  the sixty-five books contained non-binary characters.For the purpose of  this article, we have excluded the findings related to only the non-binary texts. While they give us a more complete look at characters across the gender spectrum, we wanted to focus on transgender and gender-creative characters as well as characters whose gender is undisclosed and who, in the larger world, continue to struggle with bullying, lack of  access to medical care, and increased rates of  suicide (Kosciw, Greytak, Diaz, & Bartkiewicz, 2010).We termed a second set of  characters “gender-creative,” that is, those individuals who blur gender boundaries by engaging in activities, wearing attire, or expressing interests in areas usually denoted as 6 | Bank Street College of Educationclearly masculine or feminine. These characters may not necessarily wish to transition and also may feel comfortable with the name assigned to them at birth. They may also be gender fluid, not adhering strictly to typical gender bifurcations. An example of  a text with gender-creative characters is My Princess Boy by Cheryl Kilodavis (2011), in which a young boy (referred to using male pronouns and adjectives) enjoys wearing dresses and looking like a princess. For example, the mother in the story states, “When we go shopping he is the happiest when looking at girls’ clothes” (My Princess Boy, para. 7). Gender-creative characters made up 19 (29%) of  the books analyzed. We termed a third group of  characters “transgender.” We used this descriptor to discuss the characters that will transition, are in the process of  transitioning, or have transitioned from their assigned birth gender to another gender. An example of  a text with transgender characters is I Am Jazz by Jessica Herthel and Jazz Jennings, in which the main character (Jazz) was assigned male at birth but is in the process of  transitioning to female, uses a female name, wears feminine clothing, and has a feminine identity. Quoting the text, “Mom and Dad told me I could start wearing girl clothes to school and growing my hair long. They even let me change my name to Jazz” (I Am Jazz, para. 16). Transgender characters were present in only 12 (18%) of  the 65 books. The remaining seven books (11%) contained characters whose gender was undisclosed, or contained multiple characters with varying gendered ontologies.3 For example, in the book Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl? (Savage & Fisher, 2015), a friend of  the main character Tiny (whose gender is never disclosed) asks: “Tiny, are you a boy or are you a girl?” Tiny responds, “I am me!” (Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl?, para. 21, 22). In All I Want To Be Is Me (Rothblatt, 2011), multiple characters express the need for acceptance for who they are: “Don’t call me he. Don’t call me she. Please don’t assume who I must be. ‘Cuz I don’t feel like just one of  these. I want to be all of  me. All I want to be is me” (All I Want To Be Is Me, para. 5). Of  the 65 books, the following were available in Spanish: one gender undisclosed book, three gender non-binary books, two gender-creative books, and one transgender book. We did not find any bilingual Spanish-English books containing non-binary, gender-creative, or transgender characters.3 For the purpose of discussion and ability to compare samples of more similar sizes, the books containing characters with multiple genders and the books containing characters with undisclosed genders are often combined.Occasional Paper Series | 7Findings: Basic Demographic InformationDemographics of  the 12 Transgender BooksDates of  Publication 10/12 (83%)2010-20152/12 (17%)2007-2009Language 11English1Spanish0BilingualPerceived Race 1African-American1Spanish-speaking10WhiteAssumed Biological Sex7Male4Female1UndisclosedGender Identity 7Female4Male1TransgenderHuman or Non Human Characters10Human2Non-Human*The above chart reflects the basic demographics of  the transgender books only. Of  the 12 books containing transgender characters, only one book was written in Spanish and there were no bilingual texts. The Spanish book is only available in Spain, and it took nearly nine months to obtain a copy, even with the help of  Penn State’s extensive library system.There were 19 books with gender-creative characters, two of  them in Spanish, and none were bilingual. There were five books with characters whose gender is undisclosed.4  One of  these books was available in Spanish and no books were bilingual. Two books contained multiple characters (with different gender identities).5  No books were written in Spanish or contained bilingual text.The stark absence of  transgender books was startling to us. Over 20,000 children’s books are published each year in the United States (American Library Association, 2010). We expected (perhaps hoped) to find more. The books written about transgender characters represented roughly 0.015% of  the books published in 2014. Yet, transgender people account for 0.3 % of  the population (Gates, 2011). Publication DatesThere have been transgender people since the beginning of  time (Borstein & Bergman, 2010). However, 4 Such as Meet Polkadot, in which the main character’s gender is never specified clearly5 Such as All I Want To Be Is Me, that presents multiple characters, each of which possesses a different gender constitution8 | Bank Street College of Educationuntil quite recently, trans people were unable to find representations of  themselves within English and Spanish children’s picture books. Of  the few books that do exist, most of  them were published quite recently. The first book containing a transgender character was published in 2009.Quality of  Books/AccessibilityOf  the 12 books that included transgender characters, the majority were published utilizing small, independent, or self-published presses. I Am Jazz is the only book that we found to be widely available at mainstream bookstores and libraries in the United States. This is likely due to Jazz Jenning’s exposure as a public figure in the media and its association with a reputable press (Herthel, Jennings & McNicholas, 2014). We were surprised that several of  the books contained glaring grammar and spelling errors. Several of  the books had rudimentary illustrations, much less eye-catching and enticing than those created by artists utilized by large presses. This poor quality of  several of  the texts is important to note. Perhaps for reasons of  content that was deemed controversial, lack of  quality, or both, none of  the books about transgender characters have won any major children’s picture book awards. The books included in this study were largely inaccessible to children due to limited printing and because libraries, bookstores, schools, and childcare centers typically do not stock them on their shelves. They are available for purchase on the internet (where we located several of  them), but this is prohibitive for many families, due to cost and limited access to online book selling websites. Some of  the books were available through our large university’s extensive interlibrary loan system. In most cases (with the exception of  I Am Jazz, which we were able to find at our local public library), the “more trans”/less heteronormative the books, the harder they were to find.6 Children in the United States without local advocates for the inclusion of  these books might encounter few, if  any of  these texts during their early childhood years. Perceived RaceDeterminations of  race in each text were made according to our own perception of  the race of  the characters. And as is true in the majority of  children’s picture books published in the United States, the majority of  the characters from the books in our study were white (67%) (see Figure 1). Of  the 12 6 Examples of ‘more trans’ and ‘less heteronormative’ books would include Piratrans Carabarco, or even When Kathy is Keith, both of which (especially the Spanish title) were difficult to locate. Such books present characters who do not at all fit within the gender binary of ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’ but rather blur such boundaries and proffer characters with more fluid gender ontologiesOccasional Paper Series | 9books containing transgender characters, only one included an African-American character and only one contained a Spanish-speaking character (and this was the book only available in Spain). When children of  color are underrepresented in children’s picture books, it sends the message that these children have less value; their stories are less important to tell (Creany, 1993). Figure 1.

We 10 | Bank Street College of Educationthe books with transgender characters, this was particularly telling. Seven out of  12 characters (58.3%) were assigned male, while only 4 of  12 characters (33.3%) were assigned female at birth. One of  the 12 characters had a biological sex that was undisclosed by the author. In the United States, data shows a higher prevalence of  male-assigned transgender persons than female-assigned transgender persons (Beemyn & Rankin, 2011). However, this bias towards male-assigned characters leaves female-assigned transgender children less able to find representations of  themselves in books. Transgender Characters8 • Female – 4/12 books (33.3%)• Male – 7/12 books (58.3%)• Undisclosed – 1/12 books (8.3%) Gender-Creative Characters• Female – 8/19 books (42%)• Male – 11/19 books (58%)Undisclosed/Multiple Characters• Undisclosed – 5/7 books (71%)• Multiple – 2/7 books (29%)When seeking to identify the characters’ gender identities, we looked for preferred pronouns, chosen as opposed to given names, and gender expression. Unlike biological sex (usually) and gender expression, gender identity is unseen. It is only truly known by the individual, it can be impacted by biological sex, and it can impact gender expression; however there is not always a direct correlation between gender identity and these characteristics. For example, in the gender-creative books we studied, 8/19 books (42.1%) of  the characters were assigned female at birth, 6/19 books (31.5%) had a feminine gender expression, and 10/19 books (52.6%) identified as male.Gender Identity of  Transgender Characters• Female – 7/12 books (58.3%)• Male – 4/12 books (33.3%)• Trans – 1/12 books (8.3%)recognize that children are mis-gendered at birth, and assumptions are made based on genitalia alone. We understand the challenges around the term “biological sex,” and use it for ease of discussion, although we agree that the term can be problematic.8 For all statistical charts, the first number is the number showing the present evidence, and the second number is the total number of books. For example, under ‘Transgender Characters,’ and ‘Female,’ 4/12 means that, of 12 books, 4 of those characters were female. All of our charts follow this model.Occasional Paper Series | 11*In one book, a character explicitly stated that their gender identity was “transgender.”9 Gender Identity of  Gender-Creative Characters• Male – 10/19 books (52.6%)• Female – 8/19 books (42.1%)• Neither – 1/19 books (5.3%)Gender Identity of  Gender Undisclosed/Multiple Gender Characters• Unknown – 4/7 books (57.1%)• Multiple – 2/7 books (28.6%)• Neither – 1/7 books (14.3%)Gender Identity of  All Characters (including Non-Binary)• Female – 25/65 books (38.5%)• Male – 29/65 books (44.6%)• Trans – 1/65 books (1.5%)• Multiple – 3/65 books (4.6%) • Undisclosed – 4/65 books (6.2%)• Neither – 2/65 books (3.1%)• Both – 1/65 (1.5%)Human/Non-Human CharactersFascinatingly, just over one quarter (26.2%) of  the 65 books contained non-human characters. Specifically, 2 of  12 transgender books contain non-human characters. For example, When Leonard Lost His Spots (the only text about a trans parent) is a book about a transgender/transspecies male leopard who becomes a female lion (Costa & Shupik, 2012). To quote the text, “I’m not a lion. To this I must confess. My name is now Leona and I am a lion-ESS” (When Leonard Lost His Spots, para. 11). Some of  the non-human books do not explicitly reference gender, but are metaphors for gender. In Goblinheart: A Fairy Tale, (gender undisclosed) there are two types of  characters—fairies and goblins. Julep (whose gender identity is never revealed), is born a fairy but wants to be a goblin. When Julep does not grow claws like the other goblins, this character creates gauntlets with claws for digging. Julep 9 “Trans kids like me are real and normal and awesome!” (Meet Polkadot, para. 25).12 | Bank Street College of Educationalso uses a vest to bind fairy wings that have sprouted (Axel & Bidlespacher, 2012). Quoting the text, “That night Julep made a vest that would hold wings down, then a pair of  gauntlets with stone claws for digging” (Goblinheart: A Fairy Tale, para. 15).One of  the most clever and recent books we came across was titled Red, a Crayon’s Story (Hall, 2015). In this book, a blue crayon with a red label struggles with identity. (In the text, Red is assigned a male gender evidenced in the use throughout of  the pronoun “he.”) The other crayons try to help Red become redder. They suggest that he needs more practice and encourage him to draw red things. The characters begin to question whether or not Red is indeed red. One crayon states, “Don’t be silly. It says so on his label” (Red, a Crayon’s Story, para. 16). Another replies, “He came that way from the factory” (para. 16). Some crayons question his character and others suggest simply giving him time. A variety of  office supplies attempt to fix Red. The Masking Tape suggests that Red is “broken inside” (para. 20). The crayon is then wrapped in tape. The Scissors say his label is too tight and snips it. None of  the help changes him. Finally, a crayon named Berry comes along and helps Red to realize that he is in fact blue. The other crayons question how they did not know all along (para. 32 ).Findings: Plot ArcsTable 2.

This medical professional was usually a psychiatrist/psychologist who helped the parents of  the transgender child understand her/him. This was often a critical moment in the character’s transition. Prior to meeting with the doctors, the characters were often forced to wear clothing, respond to names, and use pronouns that were uncomfortable because they did not match the characters’ gender identities. After meeting with the doctors, the children were then able to live as their genuine selves. The doctors were always portrayed positively and held in high esteem. It is as if  these doctors were the “heroes,” the saviors without whom the child would have been doomed to live an inauthentic life.  This quote from I Am Jazz does well to explain what we call “the hero narrative:”Then one amazing day, everything changed. Mom and Dad took me to meet a new doctor who asked me lots and lots of  questions. Afterward, the doctor spoke to my parents and I heard the word “transgender” for the very first time. That night at bedtime, my parents hugged me and said, “We understand now. Be who you are. We love you no matter what” (Herthel et al., 2014, para. 14). Special Talent/Saving the DayA common theme in the gender-creative books and the non-binary books as well is that characters are bullied, teased, and/or unaccepted until they demonstrate a special talent or save the day. It is almost as if  it is not acceptable to deviate from gender norms unless you have something to offer to those who do conform. These characters were not “enough” just being themselves, they had to be extraordinary.In Roland Humphrey is Wearing a What?, the main character is not accepted until he becomes confident and decides to stand up for himself  against the children who are trying to force him to assimilate to male culture (Kiernan-Johnson & Revenaugh, 2012): “What matters to me is whether you’re kind. The friends I deserve truly won’t mind if  I choose sparkly nail polish, skirts or clogs, they’ll like me for me, not for my togs” (Roland Humphrey is Wearing a What?, para. 21).In Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress, the main character paints a beautiful picture of  himself  in a dress: “And who’s that?’ his mother asked, pointing at the little boy in the tangerine dress riding 14 | Bank Street College of Educationatop the big blue elephant. Morris was hoping she’d ask. ‘That’s me,’ he said” (para. 17). He creates an engaging play-based activity for the other children: “Eli and Henry followed Morris to a planet they had never visited before. As they explored, Morris swish, swish, swished” (para. 20). It is only then that his bullies accept him (Baldacchino & Malenfant, 2014). When the prima ballerina is injured during a performance in Dogs Don’t Do Ballet, the main character, a male dog who loves to dance and wear pink tutus, gains respect when he steps in to dance the lead: “And Biff  dances like no dog has ever danced before,” (Kemp & Ogilvie, 2010, para. 21). In Nice Little Girls, the main character is only accepted by a peer once she stands up to an oppressive teacher. Her bravery as well as her ability to build things inspires the friendship: “I’m not a boy!’ said Jackie. ‘Don’t be so angry’ said Susie. ‘I just think you’re pretty brave, that’s all” (Levy & Gerstein, 1974, para. 24). The main character in Yuck! That’s Not a Monster scares away a large and potentially ill-intentioned monster: “The Big Monster wailed and dropped Little Shock in horror. He was so afraid that his fur turned to frizz and his bristles fell out” (McAllister & Edgson, 2010, para. 19). Only then is the character accepted by its siblings, who say, “Maybe being cute is useful after all” (Yuck! That’s Not a Monster, para. 21). Peer Bullying and Peer SupportRoughly half  of  the books contained portrayals of  bullying by peers. For example, more than half  the characters in the gender-creative books were bullied. Some books have unsupportive peers who disagree with the characters’ gender identity/expression, but we segregated these disagreements from acts of  bullying, such as harassment, name-calling, violence, or fear of  violence, for coding purposes. The Adventures of  Tulip, the Birthday Wish Fairy (2012) is about a magical fairy named Tulip who grants birthday wishes. One wisher in New York is a male-assigned child named David who wishes to be a girl named Daniela. The fairy consults with the Wish Captain who explains that though someone is born “looking like a boy” that person might have the “heart and mind and soul of  a girl on the inside” (para. 7). Tulip dips Daniela’s wish in “bravery broth,” puts extra luck in her pockets, places “teaching paste” on her family’s toothbrushes (to help her teachers and her doctors understand her), and sprinkles “clear sight sparkles” (para. 9) on her entire family. Later in the book, the fairy addresses a wish from Daniela’s mother. Her mother wishes for her child to be free from bullies. Tulip dips the wish in “confidence cream,” so her mother “would feel strong when she helped Daniela to face her bullies” (para. 13).Occasional Paper Series | 15As critical as the discussion of  bullying, the discussion of  peer support is equally important. Five of  the 12 (42%) transgender books included supportive peers. These characters defended and encouraged the transgender characters. We know that these supportive peers greatly impact the school experiences of  transgender children (Sullivan, 2009). Parental SupportWhen parents were present in the books, they tended to be supportive or were unsupportive at first but eventually accepted their children—this was true of  75% of  the transgender books, 74% of  the gender-creative books, and 57% of  the undisclosed/multiple books. The implications of  their parents’ support impacts transgender children in perhaps the most critical way (Sullivan, 2009), providing such inquiries for both parents of  trans children and trans children themselves, such as: Are children allowed to transition? Are they forced to retain given names, play with uninteresting/embarrassing toys, and wear uncomfortable clothing? Teacher SupportThere were fewer teachers in the books than we had expected. When teachers were present, they tended to be supportive in the transgender and gender-creative books. Interestingly, more teachers were included in the multiple/undisclosed books than in the transgender and gender-creative texts. Teachers in the multiple/undisclosed books tended to be either supportive, or they were unsupportive at first and eventually accepting of  the children.Sibling SupportWhen textually present, siblings tended to be supportive or demonstrated eventual acceptance. We found that the majority of  texts did not contain siblings. This was a startling finding, as many children in the United States do, in fact, have siblings.10 Transgender›     4/12 books (33.3%) – Supportive Sibling/Eventual Acceptance ›     1/12 books (8.3%) – Bullying Sibling ›     7/12 books (58.3%) – N/A or No Sibling Present10 A recent article showed that four out of five American families, 80%, have more than one child (Olson, 2015).16 | Bank Street College of EducationGender-Creative›     3/19 books (16%) – Supportive/Eventual Acceptance›     1/19 books (5%) – Unsupportive›     15/19 books (79%) – N/AMultiple/Undisclosed›     2/7 books (29%) – Supportive›     5/7 books (71%) – N/AImplications and Future ResearchOur study shows that there are very few transgender books in English, fewer in Spanish, and no bilingual (English-Spanish) texts.11 In the books, a majority of  trans characters are white, were assigned male at birth, and transition to female. All of  the texts containing trans characters are didactic in nature, seeking to educate a perceived cisgender audience on what it is like to be ‘trans’, that is, emphasizing the main character’s ‘trans-ness.’ As such, these texts mark the inception of  the trans character’s journey toward changing, with salient themes highlighting love, diversity, and acceptance of  trans children. There are limited representations of  trans characters in children’s books, and of  these very few are individuals of  color, Spanish-speaking or bilingual, or biological females transitioning to males. Few of  the books offer plot arcs that go beyond being educational tools for the cisgender reader. In sum, with over $1 billion of  children’s books purchased each year (Anderson and Hamilton, 2005), it is hard to ignore the enormous impact children’s literature has on both children and adults. Historically, children’s literature has presented characters that reinforce gendered stereotypes, with males as dashing princes or hard-working providers for families, and females as performing traditional tasks at home such as child-rearing, or playing with dolls and dresses (Anderson & Hamilton, 2005). Even when books are deemed “non-sexist,” in their portrayal of  female characters, very rarely do any male characters play traditionally female roles (Diekman & Murnen, 2004).With a growing number of  Spanish-speaking Americans in the U.S., and more visibility and acceptance of  trans individuals nationwide, a clear necessity exists to tell the stories of  these LGBTQ individuals 11 The dearth of these books in actual classrooms around the country represents another problematic issue, which we intend to examine in a future study.Occasional Paper Series | 17as children. Citing Hermann-Wilmarth (2010): “While literature alone might not alter students’ systems of  belief  about those different from them, it can help facilitate discussions about systems of  oppression that are at work in our society.”ConclusionsOur project seeks to promote understanding of  and sensitivity toward multiple gender ontologies in children’s books, particularly transgender characters. We hope that not only will trans children see themselves accurately represented in picture books, but also that there will be an increase in societal acceptance and approval of  non-binary gender subjectivities. We hope too that someday the notion of  a ‘spectral status’ of  transgender characters in bilingual children’s books will be referenced as a chimerical ‘ghost of  the past,’ relegated only to the shadows.AppendixBooks Reviewed by Gender of  CharactersTransgender Title Author Year Publisher10,000 Dresses Marcus Ewert 2008 Seven Stories PressBackwards Day S.
