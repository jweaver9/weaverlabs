We know from experience that this is frontier work – there are no easy, readily accessible answers to ensuring that current and future nonprofit leaders have the skills and the capacities to help their organizations succeed. The sector is just starting to figure out what works, and just starting to understand the urgency of investing in nonprofit leadership.   We were therefore delighted to learn that the Movement Advancement Project (MAP), with its track record of producing rigorous and data-driven studies highlighting key issues for the LGBT movement, was interested in tackling how best to support, nurture and grow LGBT leadership. We were even more pleased to follow the process as this report took shape through the able stewardship of MAP’s Linda Bush. We see it as a crucial contribution to the movement’s understanding of the unique leadership challenges it faces, and how to respond.   In this report, MAP offers a new and constructive take on the challenge of developing LGBT leaders. Instead of promoting one answer, one guru or one leadership development program, MAP takes a more expansive approach to addressing the diverse leadership challenges facing the movement. This report reminds us that responding to these challenges is about more than developing the skills and abilities of current LGBT nonprofit staff, as important as that is. MAP states in very clear and compelling terms that the movement needs to think about building talent in the context of a wide range of activities, from recruitment and development to deployment, retention and more.   Building LGBT nonprofit leadership talent, MAP argues, has to become an ingrained part of how organizations do their work on a day-to-day basis. And it has to be a priority not just for organizations individually, but for the movement as a whole.Takeaways for Funders  As valuable as this report will be for nonprofit organizations and their leaders, the Haas, Jr. Fund views it as a call-to-action for grantmakers that are supporting LGBT organizations and the broader movement for equality. In highlighting the whys and hows of strengthening leadership, the report points to some important takeaways for funders, including:  Ask the questions. In conversations with our grantees, we should ask questions about the kinds of resources organizations need to ensure that staff and board leaders have the skills and the capacity to execute on their strategic plans. We have found that many nonprofit leaders understand their organizations’ leadership needs. They understand the importance of investing in leadership – but they struggle with resources and know-how for doing it well. Grantmakers are in a position to connect LGBT nonprofits to the high-quality resources and support to make building leadership talent a priority.   Give the go-ahead. All too often, as MAP documents in this report, nonprofits are reluctant to invest in strengthening their own leadership because these activities are perceived as a luxury. One of our grantees reflected this reluctance when she said, “We would have felt too guilty to spend this money on ourselves.” Grantmakers can go a long way to advancing LGBT leadership by helping nonprofit leaders understand that it is not just OK – but imperative – to invest in their own development, and in systems that will build talent throughout their organizations.   Provide the resources. LGBT nonprofits will make the necessary investments in leadership if they have the funding to do so – and this is where grantmakers can have the greatest impact. At the Haas, Jr. Fund, we have seen how both small-scale and larger-scale investments can make a tremendous difference in an organization’s trajectory. From supporting coaching for an executive director to providing multi-year grants for comprehensive leadership support for staff and board leaders, grantmakers have a wide range of options they can pursue in doing this work.  Here are a few suggestions about places to start: Make talent building a part of, or the focus of, a capacity-building grants program;  t Include designated funds for leadership development as part of program and operating support grants;   tEncourage grantees to invest in strengthening the leadership of senior teams and boards in addition to the skills and capabilities of  tindividuals. 5 Provide resources to increase participation in high-quality leadership development programs; and  t Consider supporting some of the ideas for movement-wide actions that MAP presents in the following pages.  t  For four decades, the signature achievements of the LGBT movement have garnered headlines. Building LGBT leadership talent is much quieter, but no less important, work.   It is a tribute to the leaders of LGBT organizations working at all levels that we have come this far. Today, we can accomplish even more if we follow the lead of other sectors and invest in the movement’s most precious asset: leadership.   The Haas, Jr. Fund thanks MAP, and especially Linda Bush, for providing new insights and information as we and other grantmakers consider how to strengthen our investments in the leadership of LGBT nonprofits. We look forward to hearing feedback on this report from our colleagues, and ideas on steps we could take together.  Matt ForemanProgram Director Linda WoodSenior Director6INTRODUCTION Many people think that strategy is the biggest issue that determines [nonprofit] results, but in fact it is talent. Great strategy with the wrong team goes nowhere. A great team will fix the strategy and charge ahead. As is the case in the for-profit sector, building great nonprofit organizations that produce breakthrough results is a “who thing.” – Thomas Tierney, Chairman and Founder, The Bridgespan Group1  In this essay, the LGBT Movement Advancement Project (MAP) makes the case that supporting and strengthening leadership talent should be an explicit, long-term priority of the movement for LGBT equality. MAP provides both a vision and pragmatic recommendations for building LGBT nonpro!t leadership talent. The recommendations include several joint initiatives that LGBT organizations can pursue together to strengthen talent building across the movement.   This essay is rooted in a deep appreciation for the heroic role that movement leaders have played in the struggle for LGBT rights. The LGBT movement has made tremendous strides in advancing legal and social equality, especially in the past 15 years with the sweeping tide of local and state equality legislation and dramatic growth in LGBT organizations and infrastructure nationwide. For example, few would have dreamed even ten years ago that marriage for same-sex couples would become legal in a growing number of states.  However, the LGBT movement has not done enough to support, celebrate, nurture, and grow the talented and passionate leaders who have made these victories possible. In order to build on these victories and accelerate recent progress, MAP believes the movement must make a more intentional investment in supporting and strengthening its leaders.   While MAP acknowledges the important role of nonprofit board members, volunteers, public officials, academics, and writers/bloggers in the larger LGBT movement, this essay focuses on building leadership talent among paid staff members who lead and manage LGBT nonprofit organizations. These people devote their working lives to advancing LGBT equality, and MAP believes they should benefit from the same level of investment in their skills, knowledge and career development as those working in for-profit business or government, where such investments are more common.   But where should the LGBT movement target these investments? And what strategies should it pursue to build LGBT nonprofit leadership talent?  In seeking to address these questions, MAP conducted extensive research over the past 18 months, collecting and analyzing survey data on LGBT organizations’ leadership needs. MAP also conducted a thorough scan of leadership development theories, issues and practices, both broadly related to nonprofits and specific to the LGBT movement.   In order to better identify gaps and future needs, MAP compiled the comprehensive directory of LGBT leadership development programs in Appendix 1. We received key input and feedback from The Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund, which, through its Flexible Leadership Investment Program, has invested $8 million since 2002 to research, develop and implement new approaches to strengthening nonprofit leadership. Linda Wood and Paula Morris, of the Fund, were invaluable thought partners and helped crystallize many of the critical ideas in this essay.   In this paper, MAP does not seek to add to the inordinate number of books, articles and “gurus” advancing their own theories of leadership. Nor do we wish to advance one leadership development model above all others. We make no claim to having the answer to choosing or developing the most effective leaders. Instead, we have assessed the vast array of investments and actions that funders and organizations are taking and could take to improve the quality, longevity and productivity of the movement’s workforce. Our recommendations are grounded in data and evidence regarding what’s out there, what’s needed and what’s worked. 1   Quoted in Allen Grossman, Naomi Greckol-Herlich and Catherine Ross, “The Bridgespan Group: Chapter 2,” Harvard Business School management case, February 27, 2009.Kate Kendell, Executive Director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, celebrates as she holds a copy of the court order outside of the California State Supreme Court building in San Francisco, May 15, 2008, after the Court ruled in favor of the right for same sex couples to wed.AP/Wide World Photos7  MAP believes that building stronger leadership for the LGBT movement will take a multi-pronged approach based on lessons learned from those who are already engaged in this work. It will require looking across organizations, movements and sectors for practical solutions, and drawing guidance and inspiration from the rich field of leadership development. LGBT organizations and funders will need to pursue practical steps designed to deliver near-term results, while also embracing actions that are experimental and collaborative and that may take longer to bear fruit.  MAP’s aim is to start a conversation among LGBT movement leaders and funders toward de!ning a new ethic and practice regarding leadership. This conversation should be based on a shared understanding that developing and supporting professional leadership talent is a nonnegotiable investment in the LGBT movement’s long-term health and success.WHY NOW IS THE TIME TO INCREASE INVESTMENT IN LGBT LEADERSHIP TALENT The number-one resource for a great social sector organization is having enough of the right people willing to commit themselves to the mission. The right people can often attract money. …Money is a commodity; talent is not.–  Jim Collins, Good to Great and the Social Sectors2  MAP’s research has identified a gap between the LGBT movement’s collective sense of the importance of leadership talent and the few resources that LGBT organizations and their funders actually devote to nurturing and supporting leaders. In our view this cannot continue.   MAP has noted several reasons why today’s political and economic conditions demand that the LGBT movement pay increased attention to leadership development.   Leaders of LGBT nonpro!ts are facing new challenges and expectations. It is not easy being a leader in the LGBT movement today. Marriage equality has in recent years become one of the top “hot-button” issues in domestic American politics,3 resulting in a rapidly changing legal and political landscape for LGBT organizations and their agendas. Winning the battle for public opinion requires LGBT leaders to confront the movement’s opponents within a chaotic and unending news cycle dominated by TV pundits and online bloggers. Similarly, the numerous recent LGBT victories – for example, marriage equality in New England and Iowa; and safe schools legislation in North Carolina, the first gender identity-inclusive law anywhere in the South – have brought intense visibility to the movement’s leaders. While managing their nonprofits’ internal operations, leaders increasingly are being asked to fill a high-profile external role as advocates for their organizations and the movement’s broader goals.    The LGBT movement is facing a leadership transition as longtime leaders begin to pass the torch to a new generation. Many key leaders of LGBT organizations are baby boomers who will need to ensure a lasting legacy so that tomorrow’s leaders can build on their groundbreaking work. Today’s and tomorrow’s leaders of LGBT nonprofits need support during this ongoing transition so that their organizations can sustain their institutional vision, knowledge, personal networks, and historical context. At the same time, leadership investments are needed to help new What is LGBT Nonpro!t Leadership?  This essay does not specifically address the development of technical skills needed for LGBT movement work, such as policy advocacy, community organizing or media work. Rather, the focus is on the leadership skills required to articulate an organization’s vision, to ensure that all of its stakeholders (including collaborative partners) will support that vision, and to turn that vision into reality. This includes setting the organization’s direction and envisioning its future; communicating with and aligning the stakeholders whose efforts and contributions are necessary for success; motivating, inspiring, and energizing people throughout the organization; and managing them to get desired results.2    Jim Collins, Good to Great and the Social Sectors: A Monograph to Accompany Good to Great, 2005.3  For example, a May 17, 2009 front-page article in The Washington Post said that marriage equality has supplanted abortion as the main priority of social conservatives, and will be a primary focus in upcoming Supreme Court con!rmation hearings.Ian Palmquist, Executive Director of Equality North Carolina, stands in the gallery of the North Caro-lina Senate chamber, November 12, 2007.Sara D. Davis/The New York Times/Redux8and emerging leaders apply their energy and new ideas to ensure that their organizations can become still more successful and contribute to the ongoing vitality of the broader movement for LGBT equality.  Strong LGBT organizations remain the backbone of the movement for equality. Talented leaders have played an essential role in advancing the equality of LGBT Americans – and talented leaders are central to the movement’s ongoing work. But the movement cannot succeed based on the work of individual leaders alone. To secure its recent gains and further the cause of equality, the LGBT movement needs strong, effective organizations. LGBT nonprofits must be well-led and well-managed with paid, professional staff members who can help harness and support board and volunteer action at all levels of society and sustain the movement’s work over the long haul. These organizations need strong staff leaders to ensure that they have the capacity to meet increasing demands in areas from policy and legal advocacy to direct services.  Investing in LGBT organization leaders can build social justice movement leadership more broadly and nurture expanded support for the movement, even as LGBT leaders move into other !elds. Among the oft-cited objections to investing in leadership talent in the nonprofit sector is concern that the beneficiaries of such investment might leave their organizations and/or the movements to which they belong. While this is always a risk, it is also true that the LGBT movement as a whole benefits when an LGBT person who has taken part in a leadership development experience later thrives in other professional settings (particularly in allied movements). Studies suggest that the upcoming generation of LGBT advocates will feel strongly committed to multiple progressive issues; some will move from one social movement to another, and then back again. For funders and LGBT organizations weighing the return on investments in building nonprofit leadership talent, it is therefore important to consider the value of leadership development activities over the entirety of an individual’s career, as well as the benefits that accrue to the movement when talented LGBT individuals become leaders in other fields.   Organizations and funders consistently acknowledge that the time is right for increased investments in leadership for nonpro!ts. A growing number of institutional funders, donors and nonprofit leaders are speaking out about the value and importance of investing in stronger leadership. The reason: a fresh appreciation that stronger leadership leads to improved performance for nonprofits – and, in turn, greater impact on issues from civil rights to youth development. According to research by Grantmakers for Effective Organizations, institutional funders increasingly recognize that their own success is limited by the leadership capacity of key grantee organizations.4  Current investments in leadership don’t come close to meeting the true needs of the LGBT movement going forward. Like so many other nonprofits, LGBT organizations underinvest in people and infrastructure (see sidebar). Among the major reasons for this underinvestment: low levels of general operating support; pressure from donors to achieve near-term results and keep overhead low; and the perception among nonprofit management teams that leadership development is a luxury or even a self-indulgence, rather than a necessary, recurring budget item that underpins the fight for social change. This prevailing attitude has led some executive directors to express special appreciation for grants earmarked for leadership development, commenting that “we’d feel too guilty to do it on our own.” It’s time for funders and nonprofit leaders to move from identifying leadership as a priority to devoting serious resources to building leadership talent. LGBT Nonpro!ts, Funders Don’t Invest Enough in Leadership MAP’s research shows underinvestment in leadership talent among LGBT organizations and their funders.In MAP’s 2008 LGBT Career Survey, many LGBT nonprofit  tstaff members expressed dismay regarding current lev-els of support for development and training programs, pointing out that professional development budgets are often the first to be cut when money gets tight.5  Just 0.9 percent of MAP’s database of $255 million in grants  tfrom 21 major institutional funders to LGBT nonprofits (over 2004-2008) went toward leadership development for LGBT nonprofit staff members.6 A small sample of major LGBT nonprofits spent rough- tly $318 per employee on staff training and profes-sional development in 20077– far lower than the aver-age business expenditure of $1,103 per employee.8  Only a handful of LGBT nonprofits have an official human  tresource (HR) person charged with developing and im-plementing professional development and recruitment strategies.4    Kathleen P.

MAP’s interviews over the past five years with large numbers of senior leaders and major funders of LGBT organizations have surfaced a clear consensus that building leadership talent should be a movement priority.  In fact, it was the top priority for many of the people interviewed. Despite the fact that the field as a whole still under-invests in leadership, there is growing momentum for these types of investments, and MAP has indentified a solid base of resources to support leadership for LGBT nonprofits. Thirty-six percent of the existing LGBT leadership development programs profiled in Appendix 1 (8 of 22) have launched since 2008. The challenge now is to build on this momentum by funding these programs more fully and further developing the infrastructure that will support leadership development as a movement-wide priority. A VISION FOR BUILDING LGBT NONPROFIT LEADERSHIP TALENTThe goal is to develop well-rounded leaders who have the skills and personal attributes needed to adapt, act with resiliency, and combine what appear to be opposites: toughness and compassion, self-confidence and humility, individual strength and a team player mentality. The goal is not to develop ideal leaders of mythic proportions but rather people who have the ability to handle whatever is thrown their way in these times of “permanent whitewater.” – Center for Creative Leadership9  Although MAP has found general agreement about the importance of strengthening movement leadership (even if the movement still underinvests in this priority), LGBT nonprofits and their funders are less clear about what it means to build leadership talent. Indeed, MAP believes that one of the main reasons for the lack of investment in this area is uncertainty about how to do it right. Given the costs involved, many foundations and LGBT leaders want clearer roadmaps. They also want tested models that show the impact and effectiveness of this work.   In this section of the essay, MAP offers a vision for building LGBT nonprofit leadership talent that includes practical steps that organizations can pursue on their own and with others. Our hope is that LGBT leaders and funders will use this material to start a conversation about what it will take to invest smartly in building leadership talent for the movement’s long-term health. A New Model of Leadership Support  The MAP vision is founded on a new model of leadership support for LGBT nonprofits. In the past, the majority of leadership support for nonprofits in the LGBT movement and other fields has focused almost exclusively on professional development for current senior staff of organizations. These programs are important and need to be expanded.   But what if leadership development were not conceived as a special initiative or a one-time occurrence? What if organizations and funders infused a focus on building leadership talent into their day-to-day work of advancing LGBT equality?  The vocabulary we use here matters. MAP deliberately has chosen to refer to the focus of this report as “building leadership talent.” In some places, we and others use phrases like “leadership development” or “professional development,” but these terms frame the challenge in a limited way.   The fundamental challenge facing the LGBT movement is not solely about developing people. It is about ensuring that LGBT organizations have the leadership talent they need. This broadens the discussion to focus on how these organizations get the right talent in the first place, how they retain that talent, and also how they develop and grow that talent over time.   To the extent that the LGBT movement can master all of these activities, then it will increase the quality and quantity of talented leaders in the movement and, in turn, increase its success in achieving lasting gains for LGBT equality.   MAP’s five-part vision for building LGBT leadership talent, shown in Figure 1, is based on our review of thousands of pages of leadership development and talent management research and 9  Cynthia McCauley and Ellen Van Velsor, editors, The Center for Creative Leadership Handbook of Leadership Development (2nd Edition), 2004.Executive Director Lorri Jean speaks on the occasion of the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center’s 33rd anniver-sary, November 6, 2004. The L.A. Center is the world’s largest LGBT organization with $48 million in revenue in 2008 (about three-quarters from operation of health and social services).  Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images10opinion, discussions with more than 50 leadership development and talent experts and LGBT nonprofit executives, and the MAP staff ’s extensive background in leadership, leadership development and management.   In the following discussion of each of the five areas, we highlight the challenges facing LGBT nonprofits, along with recommendations for action. We also flag resources that LGBT organizations and their funders can turn to for more detailed information on these issues. And, in three of the five areas, we recommend “Opportunities for Joint Action,” which describe interventions that LGBT organizations and funders can and (we believe) should undertake in cooperation with each other to build LGBT nonprofit leadership talent on a larger scale.  1.  De!ne Strategic Aims Leadership matters a great deal to nonprofits, in part because they are primarily service organizations, whose assets are intangible; their programs and services are only as good as the people they hire and retain.– Leslie R. Crutchfield and Heather McLeod Grant, Forces for Good10  MAP believes that LGBT nonpro!ts and their funders should not view leadership development as an end in itself, but rather as a means of delivering on an organization’s – and indeed the movement’s – strategic imperatives and opportunities. In turn, strategic plans and budgets need to articulate the role of nonprofit leadership in executing strategy and provide support for building leadership talent.   Many nonprofits, in the course of their strategic planning activities, neglect to identify and secure investment in the abilities of staff and board leaders to fully enact new ideas and chosen strategies. In other words, many nonpro!t strategic plans do not include plans to systematically develop what is arguably the organization’s most important asset: the leaders and teams who do the work.   To make the connection between strategy and leadership, organizations need to answer the question, “Leadership for what?” This, in turn, will require clear articulation of:The organization’s strategic priorities, within the context of  tthe broader movement of which it is a part;  The behaviors, skills and perspectives that individual leaders  tmust develop if they are to effectively support the chosen strategies; and  The behaviors needed of the leadership team, as a whole, to  tadvance the organization’s work.  MAP’s research suggests that it is particularly important that an organization’s strategies (both writ large and with respect to building leadership talent) reflect the broader movement context. In interviews in 2007, 18 LGBT movement leaders (mostly EDs) identified priority long-term needs for any movement-wide leadership development effort. At the top of the list was cross-organizational collaboration (cited by 88 percent of the interviewees). This was followed by: greater unity on movement-wide mission and vision (50%), diversity in the upper ranks (50%), bridging the gap between young talent and experienced leadership (39%), and greater focus on a larger social justice mission (39%).11  Based on our research, MAP suggests that organizations’ annual operating plans make the link between strategy and talent building explicit and articulate the case for spending time and attention on talent-building activities. Among other things, a plan should identify the behaviors and skills that key individual leaders – and the leadership team overall – must develop to effectively support the strategic direction. It should determine the individual leaders to receive the most development resources, based on the organization’s strategic direction, growth, and anticipated needs for future leadership. Finally, it should establish mechanisms for each individual to share responsibility for managing his or her development with his or her manager.   In addition, the plan should identify talent gaps and create a plan for filling those gaps, and (whether on paper or not) provide a mechanism for identifying key talent concerns in the organization Figure 1: Building LGBT Nonpro!t Leadership TalentDevelop them on the job & o\"siteRecruit greatpeopleDeploy & managethem wellDe!ne strategicaimsRetain thebest10 Leslie R. Crutch!eld and Heather McLeod Grant, Forces for Good: The Six Practices of High-Impact Nonpro!ts, 2008. 11 Philosophy IB, Case for Talent Management across the Movement, report to the Gill Foundation, April 13, 2007.11and a process through which those concerns will be addressed. Committing the plan of action to paper makes it more likely that the organization will follow through; the plan essentially gives leaders permission to invest in their own development.    The outcomes of this process may vary widely, although many organizations may arrive at the common conclusion that they need to build a stronger senior team to advance their organization’s agenda effectively. It is difficult, if not impossible, to build a sustainable organization on the shoulders of just one person, the executive director.   For some organizations, the planning process may highlight the need to hire a new Communications Director or find a more capable Director of Technology so that technology no longer holds them back. Others may recognize that the executive director needs to play a more external role in promoting the organization and its issues, which in turn will require a shared leadership model with a senior team leading and managing the organization’s core work. And still others may decide to pursue a shared leadership model for the simple reason that younger executive directors seem drawn to more team-based, collaborative approaches to management, which they also see as effective for achieving work-life balance.    Regardless of the outcome, the important thing is to connect the organization’s strategies with the ways in which it deploys and develops talent, so that its leaders and funders can be certain that it has the capacity to achieve its goals. 2.  Recruit Great PeopleThe comparison companies in our research—those that failed to become great—placed greater emphasis on using incentives to “motivate” otherwise unmotivated or undisciplined people. The great companies, in contrast, focused on getting and hanging onto the right people in the first place. …In the social sectors, when incentives are simply not possible, the “First Who” principle becomes even more important. Lack of resources is no excuse for lack of rigor—it makes selectivity all the more vital.–  Jim Collins, Good to Great and the Social Sectors1412 MAP’s pilot of Harvard ManageMentor for LGBT Leaders will conclude on November 15, 2009. At that time, MAP will likely seek a new organizational home for this service to LGBT nonpro!ts. Meanwhile, organizations may obtain access from Harvard Business School Publishing.

The Center for Creative Leadership (CCL), a Charlotte, NC-based leader in executive education, has a number of thoroughly vetted frameworks for facilitating these types of discussions. The goal of the frameworks, according to CCL, is to facilitate “Exploration for Development” among leaders in a community facing complex challenges that defy existing approaches and that are beyond the capacity of any single organization to solve.13 After visiting CCL, MAP believes the Exploration for Development or similar methodology could help LGBT movement leaders bring fresh perspective and broadly-shared meaning to the complex challenges they face.  With expert facilitation, executive directors might spend a day undertaking the Exploration for Development (or similar) process and then one or two days translating learnings into a preliminary plan for joint talent-building among participating organizations.12  To ramp up their recruiting efforts, LGBT organizations need to expand awareness among LGBT people and allies about job and career opportunities in the movement; enhance and promote the attractiveness of job openings; and select the best candidates, based on a thorough assessment of experience, skills, character and fit.  Improving LGBT organizations’ recruiting capacity and skills may be the most important step the movement can take to enhance leadership talent. In MAP’s LGBT Career Survey Report, 42 percent of executive directors cited recruiting as the human resources function that their organization needs most to improve – nearly double the percent that chose the next most frequent answer. Recruiting also was board members’ highest priority.   LGBT organizations and the movement as a whole will need to pay special attention to the challenge of bringing more people of color into the movement. While 70 percent of LGBT nonprofit staff members overall – and a full 77 percent of EDs – think that their organizations pay enough attention to racial/ethnic/cultural diversity in recruiting, only 65 percent of staff who are themselves people of color agree.15 Adding to the importance of building diverse organizations is opponents’ use of racial politics as a wedge to divide supporters of equal rights for LGBT individuals and people of color.   When asked to describe the ideal LGBT nonprofit, 38 percent of LGBT staff members cited “diverse” as a top-three characteristic, as shown in Figure 2.  MAP believes there is huge potential for LGBT nonpro!ts to collaborate to create shared resources that reduce the cost and improve the e\"ectiveness of hiring across the movement. With shared recruiting systems, even very small LGBT organizations could reach a level of professionalism and sophistication in recruiting that would otherwise remain beyond their grasp.   The potential for shared recruiting systems becomes obvious in a review of a few statistics about the LGBT movement:More than 2,000 people worked for pay at the 160 LGBT  torganizations that MAP worked with in 2007, indicating suf-ficient scale to justify a shared recruiting resource.16  Jobs in the movement tend to be geographically concen- ttrated in a few metro areas, allowing for locally focused and coordinated recruitment efforts. For example, more than 50 percent of the job positions at the LGBT organizations with which MAP works are located in New York, Washington, DC, San Francisco, or Boston.17  From March 2007 to June 2009, 54 percent of the job open- tings posted on Gay & Lesbian Leadership SmartBrief (http://www.smartbrief.com/news/LGBT/index.jsp) fell into just three job categories: development, communications and ED/CEO, as shown in Figure 3. While SmartBrief ads may not be representative of all LGBT nonprofit job openings, this suggests that there is sufficient concentration by job type to make sharing recruiting activities viable.  15  MAP, LGBT Career Survey Report, November 2008.16 MAP analysis of responses to surveys underlying MAP’s LGBT Movement Standard Annual Reporting, LGBT Community Center Survey, and State of the States, all 2008 editions.

If these organizations could easily share information about “runner-up” candidates with others, the movement as a whole would be able to reduce recruiting costs while simultaneously ensuring that more organizations have access to a high-quality pool of job candidates.3. Deploy and Manage People WellSkilled persons do not operate in a vacuum: their ability to accomplish tasks is strongly influenced by the larger environment in which they work. Individual performance is affected at the very least by opportunities for meaningful work, shared professional norms, mentoring, opportunities for joint action, incentives to expand skills and a sense of mission. Indeed, many analysts of human capacity building now argue that effective priority setting, sharing information and strengthening organizational culture have a greater influence over individual performance than additional training does.   – Rockefeller Foundation Series on Human and Institutional Capacity Building18Practical Guidance—Recruiting Great People  Managing to Change the World: The Nonpro!t Leader’s  tGuide to Getting Results — Consult chapter 5, Hiring Super-stars, for practical how-to advice on recruiting and hiring.

Opportunity for Joint Action—Shared Recruiting Resource  MAP recommends that a small number of LGBT nonprofits come together in 2010 to experiment with designing a shared recruiting resource that would develop mechanisms that may include: Common position descriptions and job advertisement  ttemplates. Identification of the most productive advertising vehicles  tand candidate sources. Focus group research to understand the motivations and  tconcerns of highly-qualified LGBT people who would consider serving the movement. Benchmarking of pay and benefits. t A “talent bank” of individuals interested in opportunities  tto work or move up in LGBT nonprofits. A low-cost, standardized system/methodology for managing  tthe recruiting process. Relationships with colleges and universities that serve as  trecruiting pools for progressive nonprofits. The joint effort could even designate a third-party recruiting firm that would develop and apply many of these mechanisms. A model nonprofit doing this in the social enterprise sector is Commongood Careers (http://www.cgcareers.org/), which already has engaged in conversations with MAP about potentially supporting the LGBT movement.18  Winton Pitco\", “Investing in People:  Building the Capacity of Community Development, Training and Social Enterprise Practitioners,” Human and Institutional Capacity Building: A Rockefeller Foundation Series, Issue No. 1, 2004.14  Individuals will contribute most to the LGBT movement’s success when they are situated in the right jobs at the right time. LGBT organization jobs should be designed to make the best use of the current skills of employees while providing opportunities for them to grow in their jobs and take on higher-level responsibilities and new challenges over time.   Organizations should therefore make an effort to identify individuals’ evolving skills and interests and match them to jobs that are pivotal to movement performance. Those employees who are performing effectively can be moved to jobs of greater value and complexity as they learn and grow, while those who are not can transition to less important roles or out of LGBT movement work entirely.   MAP suggests that LGBT organizations adopt the mindset that managers have explicit responsibility to make the most of their organization’s people resources – not just by deploying those resources to advance the organization’s mission, but also by supporting individuals’ professional development and career advancement. Making subordinates’ professional development a core responsibility of managers helps secure the long-term health of the organization.19 It also signals to employees that they really count. Russ Finkelstein, associate director of Idealist, has said, “People need a sense that their employer is invested in their growth, and in many cases, they’re not getting that in today’s nonprofits.”20   Managers are in a pivotal position to infuse a talent-building sensibility into the day-to-day work of advancing LGBT equality because a large portion of staff development naturally occurs on the job. Looking back on their careers, successful executives consistently say that they learned more from influential people at work and from challenges inherent in their jobs than from formal training programs and other non-work experiences21 (see Jerry Hauser case study on page 16). And, organizations characterized by good overall management and attention to talent building, are much better positioned to identify the people with natural leadership abilities, at which point higher-cost investments in their individual development can provide further payoffs.  MAP’s LGBT Career Survey Report provides further evidence of the link between day-to-day management practices and talent building. The survey asked LGBT nonprofit staff members how their organizations could best foster their personal career development and advancement. Almost a quarter of the responses (the second-highest category overall) said their organizations should improve overall management and leadership (see Figure 4 above and box on facing page). 19 Per Business Week (October 2007), Pepsico has moved to awarding incentive compensation based equally on people development and business unit operating results (up from 1/3rd people development and 2/3rds operating results).   20 Quoted in GEO Action Guide: Supporting Next Generation Leadership, Grantmakers for E\"ective Organizations, February 2008.    21 Cynthia McCauley and Ellen Van Velsor, editors, The Center for Creative Leadership Handbook of  Leadership Development (2nd Edition), 2004.22 MAP, LGBT Career Survey, November 2008.Clarence Patton, then Executive Director of the New York City Gay & Lesbian Anti-Violence Project and National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, honored by New York City Comptroller William C.

Thirty-one percent of the free-form answers cited factors related to better leadership or management of LGBT organizations, nearly double the next most frequent answer (better pay). In other questions, many current and former LGBT movement staff reported frustration with management practices; free-form comments indicated that better leadership and management would be essential to recruitment and retention.   One aspect of day-to-day management that is key to talent building is enabling people to advance in their jobs and move to more senior jobs as appropriate. In the MAP survey, 76 percent of LGBT nonprofit executive directors and senior managers indicated that their organizations perform poorly in developing and promoting staff from within, as shown in Figure 5. In an interview, the executive director of a well-respected state-based LGBT advocacy organization noted, “We need to make pathways for young people – make movement work something that one can make a career of, without having to go corporate at 35.”23  In a sign of the challenges facing the movement, only 43 percent of LGBT staff members said they are satisfied with professional development opportunities in their organizations. This figure was 5 percent lower than the comparable percentage among LGBT people working in other nonprofits. Even more concerning is that fact that 30 percent of LGBT staff are expressly dissatisfied with career opportunities in their organizations. About 50 percent of middle/first-line managers and non-management professionals said they would likely leave the movement for a job with better advancement opportunities; about 31 percent of executive directors and other senior managers would do so.  MAP believes that people learn when they are in jobs that require a small, manageable bundle of skills they don’t already have. LGBT organizations might therefore use professional development as a criterion when assigning individuals to jobs and help employees see and capitalize upon the learning opportunities in their jobs.   Adding to the challenges facing LGBT organizations as they seek to deploy and manage people more effectively is the changeover of generations (from baby boomers to generations X and Y). To succeed over the long term, the movement needs to engage sexually diverse and gender non-conforming youth, many of whom do not relate to categories like LGBT.

Figure 5: EDs:  How Well My Organization Developsand Promotes Sta\" from WithinVery or somewhat poorly76%Very orsomewhatwell11%Neither wellnor poorly13%16Case Study—Jerry Hauser on How Good Management Helps Develop Leaders  One of my best accomplishments as COO of Teach For America (TFA) was ultimately a leadership development story. One of our local offices was really struggling, programmatically and financially. We were raising around $40,000 a year and we weren’t sure whether it was possible to raise more. I spent a lot of time with the ED trying to coach her through, but things weren’t getting better. Ultimately, after a lot of agonizing, I had to let the ED go. (You’re probably thinking, “This isn’t a very inspiring leadership development story!”)  Part two of the story, though, is that around the same time this was going on, I met a woman named Elisa Villanueva, who struck me as incredibly impressive – smart and a total go-getter. She was still teaching and wasn’t in a position to join our staff when I first met her, but I put her on my list and reached out to her periodically to see what she was thinking about next steps in her career. When we let the old ED go, Elisa agreed to take the job. In one year, revenue went from $43,000 to $285,000; in two more years we hit $1 million, with comparable progress on the programmatic side.  Today TFA has grown to over 1,000 people and Elisa is its COO. I look at Elisa with pride when I think of the role I played in her trajectory. I never set out explicitly saying, “I’m going to focus on leadership development.” Instead, I focused on trying to get results in that local office, which led me to do things that ended up turning into a leadership development success. In Elisa’s case, I can’t remember spending a dime on anything that’d be typically called “leadership development” – leadership classes or offsites, coaching, or formal mentoring.   If not those things, then, what do I believe leadership development is? Fundamentally, good leadership development is a direct product of good management, so if you want to develop the next generation of leaders, manage well. This means ensuring you have great people on board, which means letting go of people who aren’t up to the task and heavily recruiting those who seem promising. …Once you have the right people, good management is about giving your people responsibility for meeting ambitious goals, holding them to a high bar, and helping them get there. …Overall, then, the message is to do what it takes to get results: find great people, help them learn by managing them to ambitious goals, and do whatever it takes to retain them.– Jerry Hauser, CEO of The Management Center2424 The Management Center is a progressive nonpro!t founded by Peter Lewis, former CEO of Progressive Insurance, who is also a major donor to MAP.

These tools, which could be customized by organization type (e.g., advocacy organizations, community centers), might include: A schema of common LGBT movement jobs and the key knowledge, skills and abilities needed to succeed in each job. MAP  talready has begun this work. Figure 6 fits nearly all job titles across 120 LGBT organizations into a dozen fields/career tracks. Forms and online systems to identify and record individual staff members’ current strengths, weaknesses and development po- ttential vs. the standards for their current and prospective jobs (e.g., common terminology to describe relevant skills and experi-ence; common performance review forms). An online system for tracking individuals’ personal career interests. Combined with the skills tracking mentioned above, this data- tbase would enable quick identification for development planning and of candidates when jobs come up. An online career management site for staff members, which would complement the systems and tools for organizations. This  tmight include tips, tools and practical advice for managing one’s own advancement and development (e.g., “how to make the most of your annual performance review”).   Having this infrastructure in place would help individuals see LGBT movement work as a serious, professional career with clear advancement potential.  It could even lay the basis for a “talent market” in which individuals take personal initiative and organizations collaborate to place staff members in ever more challenging jobs as they become ready, sometimes crossing organizational boundaries.

Develop People on the Job and O\"siteOur major criticism of the approach of many organizations to leader development is that it is not systemic but rather events-based. …Too often the answer is to send the engineer to a training program, and the shorter it is the better. There is no question of determining readiness, no feedback prior to training, no planned support or reinforcement upon return. The hope is that this kind of training “fixes” people. As you will discover, we have found that training is a powerful intervention and an important part of a developmental system—but it is only one part. – Center for Creative Leadership27  LGBT nonprofits need to help current and emerging leaders develop the knowledge, skills and abilities that will enable them to successfully lead their organizations and advance the cause of LGBT rights. But developing leaders is not easy – there are so many changing ways of thinking about “leadership” and “leadership development” that the concepts, language and frameworks become fragmented and unclear. After reviewing more than 100 articles and books on the subject, MAP recommends that LGBT nonprofits use the simple enumeration of 12 targets of individual leader development in the box on page 19.  Leader development in the LGBT movement needs to emphasize participation and shared ownership beyond the executive director, and beyond the walls of individual organizations. Just as in for-profit business today, LGBT organizations are discovering that leadership styles grounded in formal authority do not fare well in the new “networked” workplace or with upcoming generations of staff and leaders. Gara LaMarche, President of Atlantic Philanthropies, opines, “It is not possible to deal with leadership in a vacuum without considering the changing nature of the workplace—indeed, the way work is structured.”28  LGBT nonprofits, in particular, are trying to solve problems and make social and political changes that are too big for any one organization to solve alone. No single entity has the technical capacities to resolve the challenges facing LGBT organizations and the movement as a whole – and no single entity “owns” them either. Thus, LGBT leaders need greater skills in systems thinking and contextual analysis, negotiating and influencing, building sustainable partnerships and building capabilities for change.   MAP believes that LGBT nonprofits and their supporters should view creating such pathways as a movement-wide, rather than organizational, challenge. The majority of LGBT organizations are likely too small to offer realistic career pathways on their own, such that cajoling small organizations to take these steps is not the answer. For instance, a research assistant might aspire to be a research director, but in a small organization with only one such slot and an incumbent unlikely to move, that aspiration might not be feasible. Viewed across the movement, though, the aspiration becomes more realistic – and in fact, would help other organizations fill critical talent gaps.  Of course, losing a capable research assistant or other valued staff member can be hard for a small nonprofit organization. But research demonstrates that companies where top employees can negotiate job transfers (which MAP perceives as somewhat analogous to transfers among LGBT movement organizations) have higher returns on sales, investments, assets and equity.2626  “Making a Market in Talent,” McKinsey Quarterly, 2006 number 2.  27 Cynthia McCauley and Ellen Van Velsor, editors, The Center for Creative Leadership Handbook of  Leadership Development (2nd Edition), 2004.28 From the foreword to Working across Generations: De!ning the Future of Nonpro!t Leadership by Francis Kunreuther, Helen Kim and Robby Rodriguez, 2009.

This is in part due to increasing acknowledgement of the time and consistent effort it takes individuals to really own new leadership capabilities, as depicted in Figure 7. Some experts go so far as to say that effective individual leader development is less about specific practices and more about consistent and intentional implementation.30 A Business Week columnist opines, “At one time, corporate education programs were a disconnected series of independent events. In today’s best firms, they are part of an integrated career-development plan that is tied to strategic objectives with specific, actionable goals.”31  The best individual leader development initiatives tend to integrate or link various developmental experiences. For example, when a leader is tapped for a tough new job assignment, the development program could precede that assignment with open conversations about expectations and learning goals; time a training experience to help the leader rise to the challenge; and then supplement the developmental assignment with ongoing feedback, coaching, and opportunities to reflect on what and how the leader is learning. Ideally, each of the development experiences in the sequence should combine elements of Assessment, Challenge, and Support, as depicted in Figure 8.3230 David D.

Courtesy of Out for Work21  Coaching is a development activity that appears particularly suited to today’s working world. A 2008 survey by the American Management Association found that 71 percent of North American companies already use or expect to institute coaching programs in the future.33 Generally, coaching is a practice in which a coachee and her coach collaborate to develop the coachee’s understanding of personal strengths and weaknesses; identify her primary developmental tasks; challenge current constraints while exploring new possibilities; and ensure accountability and support for reaching goals and sustaining development.34  Coaching is particularly well suited to nonprofits because it tends to address real-time issues embedded in the organization’s day-to-day context, and because it can be tailored to the organization’s and the leader’s specific needs, as well as the available resources for coaching.35 Within the Haas, Jr. Fund’s Flexible Leadership Awards (FLA) program, grantees’ single-largest spending area has been coaching (20 percent of all outlays), and many FLA executives credit coaching for significant successes in their organizations. (See Paula Morris case study above.) A research report on coaching commissioned for the FLA describes a successful coaching engagement as one that is organized around clear goals; features some form of assessment; and links individual development to organizational performance.36 The Haas, Jr. Fund also points out that coaches need to have a background in the nonprofit sector.  Case Study—Paula Morris on Investing in Coaching and Other Talent-building Supports for Leaders  As project director for the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund’s Flexible Leadership Awards (FLA) Program, I have had a firsthand view of how LGBT nonprofits can use cost-effective external resources to help build leadership talent.   Through the FLA Program, the Haas, Jr. Fund gives small and mid-size organizations a rare opportunity: multi-year funding for leadership development, and consulting support to decide how to use it best. One organization that made the most of this support is Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center, a San Francisco-based agency rooted in the LGBT community that serves Asian and Pacific Islanders living with HIV/AIDS. When the organization became an FLA grantee, its deputy director, Lance Toma, was stepping up to replace a longtime executive director.     Lance used the organization’s grant funds to hire an experienced nonprofit manager as an executive coach. Lance had a good idea of what he wanted and needed to do as he prepared to take the reins of the organization. The primary goal of the coaching was to help him figure out how to do it.    Two key areas Lance focused on as a result of the coaching were strengthening the organization’s fund development and building a stronger leadership team. To strengthen the organization’s fundraising capacity, Lance decided not to join the flood of organizations trying to recruit the perfect development director – i.e., someone with a track record and significant major donor expertise. Instead, Lance hired a strong development manager with good experience, clear talent and a passion for the organization’s work, and then brought in a coach to help build the new hire’s skills and expertise on the job.  Similarly, when it came to building the talent of the agency’s leadership team, Lance brought in a coach who helped team members shift old patterns of communication, clarify their purpose and roles, and hold themselves accountable for their performance, both as individuals and as a team.   Lance’s experience – and that of his organization – shows that investing in leadership support for LGBT nonprofits is not an expensive luxury but an essential complement to strong management. Three years later, Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center has emerged from the executive transition healthier than ever: despite the state of the economy, its programs are thriving, with a growing donor base, an engaged board, a strong business plan and an ambitious expanded mission. As Lance put it, he still worries like any other nonprofit executive director, but thanks to coaching he’s worrying about the right things.  What made the difference? Lance credits the opportunity to build staff capacity over time and onsite with coaching that focused on the organization’s real-time leadership challenges.— Paula Morris, Program Director Haas, Jr. Fund Flexible Leadership Awards Program34 Cynthia McCauley and Ellen Van Velsor, editors, The Center for Creative Leadership Handbook of Leadership Development (2nd Edition), 2004.35 Kim Ammann Howard, Michelle Gislason and Virginia Kellogg, Coaching and Philanthropy: An Action Guide for Grantmakers, forthcoming from GEO.  36 William P. Ryan, Coaching Practices and Prospects: The Flexible Leadership Awards Program in  Context, a report for the Haas, Jr. Fund, May 12, 2009.  MAP also obtained the AMA survey !gures  there.  Appendix 1 of this essay, page 38 has more information on the FLA. 22  A related practice that is just beginning to emerge in nonprofits is development of a nonprofit organization’s senior team as a whole. This work often includes on-site, in-team training experiences that can be integrated more easily into the organizational context. In fact, team-based training mitigates against one of the major downsides of individual development: the individual’s return, after a leadership development experience, to an organizational environment where no one else’s attitudes or behavior have changed. Leadership development efforts are much more effective when members of the top leadership team have a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the organization, as well as the skills and capacities they need to succeed.     In assessing and implementing these and other strategies for developing employees, LGBT organizations and their funders should pay special attention to making sure that development opportunities are available to people of color.  MAP’s survey revealed that only 47 percent of staff members who are people of color (compared to 60 percent of white staff ) believe their organizations pay sufficient attention to racial/cultural/ethnic diversity when developing and promoting staff.  The good news is that many of the existing LGBT leadership development programs profiled in Appendix 1 are designed to target people of color, who make up about 39 percent of paid staff of LGBT organizations. Of the 22 leadership development programs, 13 (59 percent) give preference to people of color, including five (23 percent) that are limited to people of color only. Additionally, one program (the Pipeline Project’s Organizational Development and Strategic Planning for Diversity/Inclusion) is entirely built around people-of-color issues, bringing the total share of programs that give preference to or focus on people of color to nearly two-thirds. 5. Retain the Best People I find it puzzling that people who clearly understand the idea of investing in great companies run by the right people often fail to carry the same logic over to the social sectors.– Jim Collins, Good to Great and the Social Sectors37  LGBT nonprofits need to keep their best leaders personally engaged in the movement for long periods of time. Based on MAP’s research, the four key activities that drive retention are: maintaining steady funding of the organization; optimizing financial rewards (pay and benefits) and psychic rewards (enjoyment, challenge, and accomplishment); minimizing undue stress and strain on staff members; and sensitively managing underperforming staff members out of the organization to make room for high performers to move up.Matt Foreman, then Executive Director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, sits down with Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum in the middle of Broadway by the Times Square Military recruitment center to protest remarks by US Joint Chiefs of Sta\" Chairman General Peter Pace. Pace said that homosexual acts are “immoral” and that the Military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy should stand. March 15, 2007. Timothy A. Clary/ AFP/Getty ImagesPractical Guidance—Developing People on the Job and O\"site   LGBT-speci!c leadership development programs  t — For concentrated, offsite leader development experi-ences, Appendix 1 profiles 22 leadership development programs currently designed (at least in part) for LGBT nonprofits. The programs include internships and fellow-ships; training sessions at annual meetings and confer-ences; day-to-day performance support programs; and organization-focused programs.    Open-enrollment leadership development programs  tthat serve nonpro!ts in general —Such programs can operate at a more economical scale than LGBT-specific programs and they can afford to employ developers trained in adult learning methods and instructional design. Using public leadership development programs would further integrate LGBT advocates and concerns into the larger nonprofit sector, providing access to new ideas and networks. Appendix 5 contains very brief profiles of a few such programs.37  Jim Collins, Good to Great and the Social Sectors: A Monograph to Accompany Good to Great, 2005.23  In MAP’s LGBT Career Survey Report, people working in LGBT nonprofits showed less commitment to their current organizations and the field than LGBT people working in other nonprofit sectors. Less than one-third of current LGBT movement staff described an ideal next job that is within the movement. Most LGBT nonprofit employees said their current stress levels are high and they have insufficient administrative support and time to complete their work. Executive directors are especially overwhelmed, with many saying that finding a less stressful job would be the most likely reason they would leave the LGBT movement.   Across the board, respondents to MAP’s LGBT Career Survey Report perceived the pay in LGBT nonprofit organizations to be inadequate. Current LGBT nonprofit staff members said that pay will be a key factor in whether they continue in the movement (see Figures 9a and 9b), while LGBT people outside the movement said low pay caused them to leave LGBT movement work or prevents them from considering movement jobs.  In an interview, the leader of a state-based LGBT nonprofit opined, “For people who want to do the right thing and make a career of it, the financial prospects are daunting.”3838 Personal interview by Linda Bush, 2005.54%57%43%33%30%32%9%12%63% 55% 52%59% 54% 56%47% 36% 44%32% 31% 28%29% 23% 35%25% 31% 34%18% 18% 14%4% 30% 20%Figure 9a: What Would Keep Me in the LGBT Movement for Five More Years(check up to 3)Satisfactory pay/pay raisesChallenged/interested in jobFeeling I’m making a differenceHaving flexible scheduleBelieving in missionLiking the people I work withBeing mentored by senior colleagueRegular promotionsEDs Senior managers (not ED)Tech/prof – missionrelatedMiddle/!rst linemanagers45%34%43%32%14%17%56% 60% 57%56% 32% 27%34% 34% 41%30% 53% 47%16% 4% 17%13% 25% 17%Figure 9b: Why I Would Leave the LGBT Movement(check up to 3)Job with better pay/benefitsLess stressful jobMore interesting/ enjoyable jobJob with better advancement opportunitiesInvoluntary/organization foldsOtherEDs Senior managers (not ED)Tech/prof – missionrelatedMiddle/1st linemanagers24  Looking beyond compensation, it is important to note that even the most talented and enterprising leader needs sufficient organizational resources and good working conditions to succeed. No amount of leadership development can replace adequate salary levels, positive working conditions, strong planning, and appropriate resourcing for activities from polling and opposition research to communications and fundraising.    Equipping leaders properly to get their jobs done is mostly about good overall nonprofit management – it requires focused attention on issues from strategic and operational planning to fundraising and communications with donors. Like all nonprofits, LGBT organizations need to seek more resources to the extent possible, but then “size” the organization’s work to the resources available, so as not to stretch staff members too thin.  Bridgespan points out that, in the short run, staff members may be able to “do more with less,” but ultimately the organization’s beneficiaries suffer.39 This is an area where major funders need to take the lead to ensure that LGBT nonprofits have the financial wherewithal to achieve organizational and movement goals (see foreword to this essay by Linda Wood and Matt Foreman of the Haas, Jr. Fund).  The LGBT movement’s culture is such that the need to fund immediate crises overshadows most conversations about building the sector’s long-term sustainability. As hard as it is, LGBT nonprofits need to be direct with funders about the level of funding truly needed to execute programs and let funders know that undercapitalizing programs will likely lead to less than optimal results.  MAP also recommends that LGBT funders provide more opportunities for renewal of long-time leaders via sabbaticals or rotations into learning-rich projects that call on leaders to develop and practice new skills. In the broader nonprofit sector, sabbatical opportunities are one option for offering recognition and tribute to the recipient, while also providing an opportunity for rejuvenation. A recent evaluation has shown that when sabbaticals are planned well, they also can be a powerful way to develop the second tier of leadership that steps up while the leader is away.40 There are also “leadership renewal programs,” usually offered in retreat settings where leaders are given the opportunity to reconnect with the values, personal vision and passion that drive their work and keep them engaged.Ruth Harlow, then Legal Director, and Kevin Cathcart, Executive Director, both of Lambda Legal, talk to the press outside the U.S. Supreme Court building, after the court struck down sodomy laws that make it a crime for persons of the same sex to engage in sexual relations. Ruth Harlow was lead attorney on the case. June 26, 2003. David Hume Kennerly/3rd Party - Misc/Getty ImagesPractical Guidance—Making the Case for Resources for Building Leadership Talent    MAP intends to help LGBT nonprofits make the case for adequate funding for leadership talent by emphasizing the need for reasonable overhead in communications and presentations to funders. Also of great value for communicating with funders is Ann Goggins Gregory’s and Don Howard’s Stanford Social Innovation Review article, “The Nonprofit Starvation Cycle” (fall, 2009). According to the authors: “A vicious cycle is leaving nonprofits so hungry for decent infrastructure that they can barely function as organizations—let alone serve their beneficiaries.”  The article recommends that nonprofits commit to understanding their real overhead costs and infrastructure needs and then engage their boards to help communicate with funders. 39 Je\"rey L. Bradach, Thomas J. Tierney and Nan Stone, “Delivering on the Promise of Nonpro!ts,” Harvard Business Review, December 2008.40 Deb Linnell and Tim Wolfred, Creative Disruption:  Sabbaticals for Capacity Building and Leadership Development in the Nonpro!t Sector, 200925CONCLUSION  The private sector has been investing substantial sums in leadership development for many years, based on an understanding that the skills and capacity of an organization’s leaders are essential to its continued growth and success.   For the LGBT movement and the broader nonprofit sector, this is a relatively new frontier. Nonprofit organizations and their funders are just beginning to invest more strategically in building leadership talent. They are just beginning to figure out what works best, and what doesn’t, as they seek to ensure that current and emerging leaders have the support they need to succeed in their careers, and to contribute to the success of the important causes that their organizations work to address.  Tracking the impact of new investments in building LGBT nonprofit leadership talent is important – organizations need to understand what types of investments deliver the best results. At the same time, however, LGBT nonprofits and their funders would be wise to follow the model of their private-sector peers, who continually review and apply best practices in leadership development but are reluctant to allocate substantial time and resources to isolating and tracking “returns on investment.” The reason: leadership development is notoriously difficult to measure, even as participants and supporters regularly and enthusiastically report on the benefits that well-designed development opportunities deliver for individuals, organizations and social movements.  When funders and LGBT nonprofits invest in building LGBT nonprofit leadership talent, they are advancing a new body of work. MAP hopes that the vision and the strategies outlined in this essay can help the movement as it devotes more resources and attention to leadership issues in the months and years ahead.    MAP believes very strongly that the future of the LGBT movement depends on strong and capable leaders collaborating within and across nonprofits to advance organizational and collective goals. Funders and nonprofit leaders need to work together to make sure that the movement has the understanding and the resources to make talent building a continuing priority – because talent building leads directly to movement building, and movement building leads directly to change.After signing a memorandum to extend bene!ts to same-sex partners of federal employees on June 17, 2009, President Barack Obama shakes hands with Frank Kameny. In the late 1950s, Kameny protested his !ring due to homosexuality by the U.S. Civil Service Commission and argued the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kameny then founded the Mattachine Society, which pressed aggressively for gay and lesbian civil rights and was the subject of 1963 congressional hearings over its right to solicit funds.
