Evans4 and Lawrence v. Texas.5  That commitment wholeheartedly embraces the spirit of egalitarianism and social justice underlying President Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 “Great Society Address.” 6   Although President Johnson’s “abundance and liberty for all” imperative was meant to address the racial and wealth inequities of his time, the speech’s progressive themes were grounded in broad moral principles that apply with just as much force to the inequities facing the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (“LGBT”) community today.7  Justice Kennedy’s articulation of those themes in Windsor gets lost, however, if scholarly analysis of his majority opinion focuses not on equal liberty, but on federalism. I. INTRODUCTION Fifty years ago, on Friday, May 22, 1964, President Lyndon Baines Johnson delivered a commencement address to the graduating class of the University of Michigan.8  Looking out at the sea of people crowded into Michigan Stadium on that hot and humid early-summer morning, 9  the President spoke for approximately twenty minutes10 about “[t]he challenge of the next half century”—namely, “to advance the quality of our American civilization.”11  Reflecting upon this speech, which became known  ANTHONY M.

Warner, the Director of the Michigan Historical Collections at the University’s Bentley Historical Library, wrote in 1978 that “[m]uch of what [the speech] contained has meaning for today.”12  What did he mean by that?  Was it true then?  And, does it still have “meaning for today” in 2014 as we recognize the fiftieth anniversary of the speech? In this Article, I offer some answers to these questions.  It is not my intention to engage in an extended exposition on the speech itself, or indeed on the legacy of the Great Society.  Rather, my suggested brief answers engage this Article in a discussion of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in United States v. Windsor.13   In that case, the Court struck down section 3 of DOMA, holding that it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.14  Section 3 of DOMA stated that, “[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one man and one woman.”15  Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy argued that section 3 was inconsistent with the Constitution’s commitment to guaranteeing equal liberty.16  This is very similar to the reasoning that Kennedy employed in the majority opinions in Romer v. Evans17 and Lawrence v. Texas,18 two other landmark gay rights rulings.  I argue that this commitment in Windsor wholeheartedly embraces the spirit of egalitarianism and social justice at the heart of the legacy of the 1964 Great Society speech. In making this argument, I offer a very different picture of Kennedy’s opinion for the Court in Windsor than that which has been painted by many scholars who contend it was “based on federalism.”19  note 6.  12.

It is “sprinkled with elements of federalism” (amongst other things), 24  but the opinion’s “treatment” of the vertical separation of powers is “ultimately inconclusive and nondispositive”;25 it is “relevant, but only by the  bans?, WASH. POST (June 26, 2013), http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ the-fix/wp/2013/06/26/will-the-doma-decision-kill-gay-marriage-bans/.  One commentator went so far as to describe the opinion as “a liberal result wrapped in conservative values,” an opinion that “reads like a paean to conservative values, invoking totems such as states’ rights, federalism, and freedom from the yoke of federal oversight, couched in language a tea partier would cherish.”  James Oliphant, Supreme Court Rulings on Gay Marriage: A Liberal Result Wrapped in Conservative Values, NAT’L J.

Many of the commentaries that I critique in this Article were written quickly, in the heat of the moments following the announcement of the decision in Windsor.  This serves, in part, to absolve some authors of their misleading interpretations of the opinions in that case.  After all, closer inspection inevitably brings to light aspects that were missed and/or overlooked in the rush to meet deadlines (institutionally-imposed or self-imposed).  However, the fact remains that much of what was written was constructed upon interpretive foundations laid much earlier, either in academic literature, amicus briefs, or commentaries that followed the granting of certiorari and/or the oral arguments in this case.  Consequently, it would be wrong to avoid engaging in critical analysis of them because of their rapid response nature.  20.

First, I examine Professor Randy Barnett’s contention that Justice Kennedy “used the interference with the traditional province of states to regulate marriage to justify heightened scrutiny under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.”31  Second, I analyze Professor Rick Hills’s claim that Windsor “recogni[zes] that state law can define, at least in part, the scope of federal constitutional rights by (for instance) defining what constitutes an arbitrary classification under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause.”32  This, Hill contends, makes “the feds . . . more constrained by national constitutional rights than are the states.”33 Some say that Kennedy’s opinion in Windsor is grounded in preserving principles of federalism—a subject about which he frequently waxes lyrical, labeling it the “unique contribution of the   26.

This guarantee is neither as obviously stated nor as passionately expressed as it was in Romer and Lawrence; the opinion is devoid of the “gauzy platitudes” with which Kennedy’s opinions are so often “studded.”36  Nevertheless, that guarantee of equal liberty is at the heart of the opinion and portends, in the not-too-distant future, an America in which state bans on gay marriage cannot coexist with the U.S. Constitution. Does Windsor open the next chapter in the liberal legacy of the Great Society?  This Article provides an affirmative answer to that question.  However, it does so by first considering some of the complexities of the Great Society legacy—including the difference between policies and principles.  Additionally, the Article recognizes that while “[t]he central principles of Lyndon Johnson’s program . . . were those of amelioration and opportunity,”37 those principles were not, in 1964, expected to extend to the country’s LGBT community.

Indeed, as Ursula Hackett masterfully demonstrates, the very term “Great Society” is susceptible to multitudinous understandings and definitions – hence her argument that we should really be talking about “Great Societies.”38  To be sure, major civil rights advancements were made as a result of the Great Society agenda, but many of the President’s ambitious goals remain elusive, having encountered massive resistance almost as soon as they were announced.  Within fifteen months of addressing the Michigan graduates Johnson signed landmark legislation into law, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.39   However, many of the challenges which the President asked the country to confront went unmet.  In part this was inevitable.  They fell victim to the President’s personal, grandiose expectations.  Johnson defended the Great Society using “analysis presented in a manner that often failed to distinguish between expectations and established realities.” 40   The President’s “gigantic aspirations” were too big not to fail, because they were “clearly unattainable within one Presidency, or one generation.”41  They were, therefore, destined to rise or fall on the (mis)fortune and (dis)favor of subsequent executive administrations and congressional majorities.  And then there was, as Doris Kearns Goodwin points out, the mire and malaise of the “[i]f it hadn’t been for Vietnam”   38.

What follows in this Article is merely a very brief overview of the “Great Society.”  It is not my intention, in this Article, to revisit in detail the legacy of the Great Society.  For excellent scholarly treatments of different aspects of the Great Society agenda—both during and after the Johnson presidency, see generally, for example: JOSEPH A.

For, while objectives such as confronting poverty “were widely accepted,” it was often the case (as is so true of many facets of American governance) that “specific proposals to reach them sparked debate,” thereby generating delay and, ultimately, defeat.43  In closing the second of his two-volume biographical treatment of Lyndon Johnson, Robert Dallek reminds us of the historiographical value inherent in drawing this policy-principle distinction: Debates about the sort of social engineering Johnson sponsored will not disappear.  Nevertheless, there is at least one side of Johnson’s reformism that the great majority of Americans have embraced and seem unlikely to abandon for the foreseeable future.  There is a striking analogy here between Johnson and FDR. Roosevelt’s New Deal never brought full recovery from the Depression.  But it put in place a series of measures that humanized the American industrial system . . . . Similarly, many of the laws spawned by Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty and Great Society have either fallen into disrepute or command little support from most Americans.  But the spirit and some of the substance behind Johnson’s reform programs maintain a hold on the public imagination that endures. . . .  Johnson’s poverty war and reach for a Great Society may seem somewhat outdated or inadequate to current challenges, but the humanizing force behind them abides and gives both men historical standing as visionaries who helped advance the national well-being and fulfill the promise of American life.44   42.

For example, Newt Gingrich rode his 1990s Republican Congressional revolution into town on the back of a horse emblazoned with the message that the blame for the nation’s woes could be placed squarely upon the shoulders of Democrats who refused “to recognize that Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society has failed.” 45   This strategy was, in part, possible (although ultimately unsuccessful) because for several decades ‘liberal’ Democrats enjoyed a decidedly uneasy relationship with the legislative policy accomplishments and the broader principles of the Great Society.  They frequently “[ran] from the legacy of the Great Society and the 1960s, seeking to rebut charges that [they were] too effete, too closely tied to racial and ethnic minorities and too out of touch with the mainstream of American life.”46 As Philip A. Klinkner and Thomas Schaller persuasively argue, however, those very same legislative accomplishments and underlying Great Society principles helped facilitate the creation of a voting base which helped elect Barack Obama in 2008.47  “Somewhere,” they write, “Lyndon Johnson is smiling,” for it was the outcome of that presidential election that suggested the “Democrats have erected a majority coalition based on the votes of non-whites and the college-educated”—what Klinkner and Schaller term “the Latent Great Society Majority.”48 On January 21, 2013, President Obama gave the second Inaugural Address of his presidency.49  He invoked the words and spirit of the Declaration of Independence, just as President Johnson had done nearly a half century earlier in Ann Arbor.50    45.

The country, he observed, “continue[s] a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.  For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident [“that all men are created equal,”]51 they’ve never been self-executing.”52  To be sure, Americans could and should strive to achieve the “abundance and liberty for all” advocated by Johnson in 1964. 53   But that “journey,” Obama emphasized, “is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law – for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.”54  The President of the United States of America had just used the first speech of his second term in office to endorse gay marriage. Literature which identifies a positive and principled relationship between the Great Society’s “abundance and liberty for all” imperative and the rights and liberties of gay and lesbian Americans is conspicuous by its absence, and for good reason.  President Johnson’s “vision . . . embraced an array of legislative initiatives to improve Americans’ ‘quality of life,’” but racial and wealth inequities were the primary targets.55  At least one piece of Great Society legislation, however, specifically discriminated against members of the homosexual community.  The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act was one of that year’s “Big Four” legislative accomplishments. 56   It has been hailed by commentators as “right[ing] a long-rankling ethnic affront”57 and “signal[ing] the beginning of the era of liberalization”58  of the nation’s immigration policy.

A Senate report explained: ‘The Public Health Service has advised that the provision for the exclusion of aliens afflicted with psychopathic personality or a mental defect . . . is sufficiently broad to provide for the exclusion of homosexuals and sex perverts.  This change in nomenclature is not to be constructed in any way as modifying the intent to exclude all aliens who are sexual deviants.’61 Therefore, the 1965 law arguably was more discriminatory because it explicitly identified “sexual deviation” (homosexuality) as one of the grounds for denying admission into the United States.62  This state of affairs would not change until Congress   59.

Homosexuals were viewed as dangerous deviants who posed a threat to the liberty enjoyed by ‘normal’ and ‘healthy’ Americans.65  President Johnson spoke of “three places where we begin to build the Great Society – in our cities, in our countryside, and in our classrooms.”66   As the history of the oppression of homosexuals in the United States clearly indicates, in 1964 these were places where the average American believed that any great society was a straight society.67 Over the next three decades, the majority of the LGBT community’s pleas for judicial intervention fell on deaf ears, especially at the nation’s highest court.68  The well-documented, and immensely significant expansion of civil rights and liberties by the Warren Court 69  (and, to a lesser extent, the Burger Court) 70  did not extend to those individuals experiencing discrimination based upon their sexual orientation.71  As Marc Stein convincingly demonstrates in Sexual Injustice, even the   63.

Hardwick.86 As Emily Bazelon aptly observes, “Michael Hardwick may have the worst timing of anyone ever to come before the Supreme Court,”87 because his (unsuccessful) constitutional challenge to a Georgia criminal sodomy law came before the justices against the backdrop of the AIDS crisis, a crisis that “revealed how tenuous the progress of gay liberation had been.”88  Writing for the five-justice majority, Justice Byron White produced an insensitive and tradition-oriented opinion that read the concepts of liberty and equality at a very narrow level of generality.89  In his view, the case did not involve broad, sweeping questions of individual, personal privacy and autonomy.90  Quite the opposite.  In White’s words, the question in the case was “whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.”91  White rejected, out of hand, any claim that such a right could be found in the Constitution’s text.92  It was not “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”93  And it could not be considered “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”94  Therefore, Hardwick’s claim failed all of the standard   84.

Any argument to the contrary was, “at best, facetious.”95 The week after the justices met in conference to decide Bowers, Justice Lewis F. Powell changed his position, thereby casting the crucial fifth vote to uphold the Georgia law.96  Powell agonized over the case.  Ultimately, the staid, conservative Virginian was unable to comprehend the nature of homosexual attraction and, consequently, the importance and meaning of Hardwick’s rights claim.97   Famously, four years later, Powell publicly confessed that he considered himself to have voted (or switched to voting) the wrong way in Bowers: “‘I think I probably made a mistake in that one,’” he said.98   By contrast, Justice Kennedy (President’s Reagan’s third choice to replace the retiring Powell)99 viewed Bowers as misguided from the day it was decided (as he would later get the chance to say in the pages of the U.S. Reports in his majority opinion in Lawrence).100  As he explained to a gathering of Canadian jurists at Stanford University in July 1986: [M]any argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct.  If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the State of Georgia has the right to make a wrong decision—wrong in the sense that it violates some people’s views of rights in a just society.101 Upon the announcement of Kennedy’s Supreme Court nomination many gay rights advocates looked past that speech.

For example, at the time of Kennedy’s confirmation hearings, law professor Arthur S. Leonard commented in the New York Native that, “Kennedy seems rather obtuse on important gay issues, and indeed must be counted a likely vote against us on most matters likely to come before the Supreme Court.”102  Kennedy’s “appointment should come as no cause for joy among gay people,” Leonard concluded.103  For “it seems unlikely that gays alone can block his confirmation, and equally unlikely that Ronald Reagan would appoint anyone who would have voted differently in [Bowers].”104  A copy of the article accompanied the testimony of Jeffrey Levi, Executive Director of the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force, before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Levi “look[ed] to Judge Kennedy’s record in hope of finding indication that his definition of American society and the Constitution is more inclusive” than that of the Bowers majority.105  “Unfortunately,” he concluded, “little hope can be found.”106  Levi and Leonard both focused upon the small number of gay rights-related opinions Kennedy had penned since 1975, during his time on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.107  As I explained in my book, a close reading of those opinions, together with Kennedy’s pre-Supreme Court nomination speeches (especially his post-Bowers Stanford speech), does not support Levi and Leonard’s conclusions.108  Those materials make it clear that Kennedy’s transformation into “a jurist who treats gay rights claims seriously”109 did not suddenly take place one day in 1996   102.

In that case, the Court struck down a state constitutional amendment that singled out discrimination based upon sexual orientation as something from which people could not seek governmental protection.110  “It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort,” wrote Justice Kennedy.111  “Central both to the idea of the rule of law and to our own Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection,” he continued, “is the principle that government and each of its parts remain open on impartial terms to all who seek its assistance.”112  Seven years later, the justices went much further, issuing the landmark ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, holding unconstitutional a state law criminalizing homosexual sodomy (and, consequently, overturning Bowers).113  And then, exactly ten years later, came the decision in Windsor114—liberal progress indeed, and progress arguably entirely consistent with the principles embodied in the concept of the Great Society. III. “[T]HE MEDIATING IDEA OF ARBITRARINESS”115 – OR, THE FEDERALISM ROAD NOT TAKEN IN WINDSOR In the months following the decision in Romer, Jeffrey Rosen interviewed Pete Wilson, former Governor of California and U.S. Senator, for a New Yorker profile of Justice Kennedy.116  One of the ways in which Wilson described the jurisprudence of his good friend was as follows: “I think it strikes him as terribly unfair that anyone’s individual potential should be in any way limited by their being classed as a member of a group, and treated in  b8705e4e50460854ae9b9b5af4.

That is why I chose to open chapter three of my book, The Tie Goes to Freedom, with this quotation. 118   Wilson’s words perfectly describe the central animating principle of the main opinions analyzed in that chapter—Kennedy’s writings for the Court in Romer and Lawrence.119 Wilson’s words also can explain the Court’s opinion for the five-justice majority in Windsor. Responding to Windsor, Michael Dorf, a former clerk for Associate Justice Kennedy, quipped that, “[i]f Bill Clinton was ‘the first Black president,’ Anthony Kennedy has now firmly secured his place in history as ‘the first gay Justice.’”120  To some extent, this reflects the fact that in Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor Justice Kennedy was the key member of the Court—the ideological centrist whose vote was essential for the lawyers to secure in these cases.  However, as I explained in my book, and discuss below, Kennedy’s vote was never in doubt.121  Therefore, Dorf’s assertion is better understood as being attributable to the fact that Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in each of these cases. Ten years ago, Professor Dorf observed that Kennedy’s authorship of Romer gave an air of predictability to Justice Stevens’s decision to assign Kennedy the task of writing the majority opinion in Lawrence.122  “The writing was, if not on the wall, at least in the vicinity of the wall,” remarked Dorf.123  There is every reason to believe that Stevens was aware of the extent to which his colleague felt passionately about extending liberty and   117.

In Lawrence (and, indeed, in Romer seven years earlier), Kennedy did not “agonize” over the case, a character trait he has repeatedly been accused of exhibiting in his judicial decision-making.124  Powell “waited and waffled” when deciding Bowers.125  By contrast, in Lawrence, as he “later told Thurgood Marshall’s wife,” Kennedy considered “the right result” to be “so obvious” that he penned the opinion “over the course of one weekend.”126  If the writing in Lawrence was “in the vicinity of the wall,”127 after the justices voted in Windsor the identity of the majority opinion’s author was surely etched in indelible ink.  As the Senior Associate Justice in the Windsor majority, Kennedy likely did not hesitate to self-assign the opinion.  As Jeffrey Rosen observes, “[e]ver since Justice Kennedy held in Lawrence v. Texas that moral disapproval of homosexuality isn’t a legitimate purpose for any law, the writing was on the wall for DOMA.”128  And as Windsor made clear, Kennedy “not only accepts, but welcomes the task of writing majestic opinions affirming the dignity of gay persons and couples.”129 Kennedy’s assessment of section 3 of DOMA is blunt and unequivocal in Windsor: its “principal purpose is to impose inequality.”130  DOMA tells Mark and Mary that when they got married in Des Moines they were immediately entitled to a plethora of federal benefits by virtue of being husband and wife; it simultaneously informs Mark and Mary’s Iowan neighbors, Sandra and Sarah, that they will be denied those very same benefits simply because they chose to enter into a lawful (in the eyes of Iowa) marital relationship with a person of the same sex.

This is clear in the Windsor opinion passage that Professor Dorf astutely describes as “the money quote from the majority”:136  DOMA undermines both the public and private significance of state-sanctioned same-sex marriages; for it tells those couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal recognition.  This places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage.  The differentiation demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, and whose relationship the State has sought to dignify.  And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples.

Under DOMA, same-sex married couples have their lives burdened, by reason of government decree, in visible and public ways.  By its great reach, DOMA touches many aspects of married and family life, from the mundane to the profound.137 It is here that we see the crucial theme of the opinion: it is irrational, demeaning (privately and publicly), and, therefore, unconstitutional to treat any individual differently because of their sexual orientation.138 A. Justice Kennedy on Federalism The crucial theme is obscured if one focuses on the federalism references.  This is not to say, however, that it is impossible to understand why some commentators latched onto those references.  The vertical separation of powers in the American system of government is, after all, a subject about which Kennedy has spoken passionately and often throughout his judicial career. 139   Kennedy has called federalism the “most brilliant political theory breakthrough of many centuries,” a central “part of the dynamic of freedom that the Framers insisted upon”;140 and in his solo concurrence in U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton he famously labeled it “our Nation’s own discovery.”141  When the Framers conceived of federalism, Kennedy wrote, they “split the atom of sovereignty.”142   137.  Windsor, 133 S.

B. Analyzing Barnett In his SCOTUSblog commentary on Windsor titled Federalism marries liberty in the DOMA decision, Randy Barnett contends that Kennedy employed “‘federalism’ logic, but with a significant twist that converted it from an enumerated powers [argument] into a ‘liberty’ argument.”152  Kennedy, he says, “used the interference with the traditional province of states to regulate marriage to justify heightened scrutiny under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.”153  Barnett argues that it is this “novel” component of Kennedy’s opinion that “seems to have confused the dissenters.”154  Barnett describes the “logic” of the Justice’s opinion in the following way: (1) The definition and regulation of the right to marry is traditionally the province of states (and is not among the enumerated powers of Congress[)].

(3) Therefore, the Court will use heightened scrutiny to evaluate the rationality of DOMA’s imposed definition of marriage[.] (4) This unusual deviation from the past practice of respecting state law definitions of marriage was improperly motivated by animus.155 The first two components of Barnett’s interpretation of the logic of Kennedy’s opinion are uncontroversial, and do indeed speak to the federalism aspects of the opinion.  However, if we accept parts three and four of Barnett’s interpretation, then we reach a troubling and controversial conclusion.  For, those parts of his interpretation indicate that Kennedy’s opinion must be viewed as a significant jurisprudential departure from both Romer and Lawrence, an illiberal departure that sets back rather than advances the rights and liberties of the LGBT community.156  It cannot, under this interpretation, be viewed as an “[individual] ‘liberty’ argument,” as Barnett suggests. 157   This is because “under Justice Kennedy’s reasoning” as Barnett reads it, “it is the fact that states have recognized same-sex marriage that gives rise to heightened judicial scrutiny” of DOMA.158  In other words, the harmed parties are states that have recognized same-sex marriage rather than those states’ citizens.  Barnett is right that in this case “state law is being used to identify a protected liberty or right within its borders”; 159  in this respect, his interpretation can peacefully coexist with the concept of state-conferred dignity, as discussed below.  However, Barnett’s interpretation is in tension with the human dignity references because it indicates that heightened scrutiny will be given to DOMA for its interference with the legal recognition of individual liberty that a State chose to confer.160  Consequently, it is also difficult to reconcile it with the   155.

Take, for example, the comments that formed part of the opinion penned by Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs for the Second Circuit in Windsor, 699 F.3d at 180–81.  This was the first federal circuit opinion to hold that “heightened scrutiny” was the relevant standard of review in a gay rights case.  See id. at 181.  In so holding, the Second Circuit cited four factors, based on Supreme Court precedent, to be considered in determining whether to extend the “quasi-suspect class” designation to a new group.  Id. at 181–82.  The Jacobs-led majority was unequivocal in its conclusion that sexual orientation was such a classification, stating:  In this case, all four factors justify heightened scrutiny: A) homosexuals as a group have historically endured persecution and discrimination; B) homosexuality has no relation to aptitude or ability to contribute to society; C) homosexuals are a discernible group with non-obvious distinguishing characteristics, especially in the subset of those who enter same-sex marriages; and D) the class remains a politically weakened minority.

At argument, counsel for BLAG wittily characterized this form of analysis as “rational basis plus or intermediate scrutiny minus.”  The Supreme Court has not expressly sanctioned such modulation in the level of rational basis review; discussion pro and con has largely been confined to concurring and dissenting opinions.  We think it is safe to say that there is some doctrinal instability in this area.  Id. at 180–81 (citations omitted) (quoting Massachusetts v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 682 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2012); Transcript of Oral Argument, supra note 162, at 16)).  Justice Scalia has also been deeply critical of Kennedy’s failure to walk the walk, but not talk the talk for fundamental rights and suspect classes.  See, e.g., Romer, 517 U.S. at 636 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  “The Court evidently agrees that ‘rational basis’ . . . is the governing standard,” Scalia wrote in his dissent in Romer, but in the subsequent pages of his dissent, he engaged in a lengthy expression of his incredulity at Kennedy’s inability to find a rational basis for Amendment 2 of the Colorado Constitution, which was the provision struck down in Romer.

Scalia ultimately concludes:  The majority opinion need not get into the strict-vs.-rational-basis scrutiny question, and need not justify its holding under either, because it says that DOMA is unconstitutional as “a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution”; that it violates “basic due process” principles; and that it inflicts an “injury and indignity” of a kind that denies “an essential part of the liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment.”  The majority KNOWLESFINALEDITWORD.DOCX (DO NOT DELETE) 2/5/2015  3:24 PM 50 ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 20:24 at the conclusion that Kennedy’s opinion in Windsor employs “heightened scrutiny”?  The opinion twice hints at the standard of review it is applying.  DOMA “is invalid,” writes Kennedy in the final paragraph, because “no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity.” 168   This strongly indicates that the Court had used rational basis review.  In support of part three of his summary, Barnett points to the other statement in the opinion that suggests a standard of scrutiny: “In determining whether a law is motived by an improper animus or purpose, ‘[d]iscriminations of an unusual character’ especially require careful consideration.” 169  Other commentators agree that this “sounds more like heightened scrutiny,”170 an observation that some also made about identical language in Romer.171  Ultimately, however, this statement does  never utters the dreaded(?) words “substantive due process,” perhaps sensing the disrepute into which that doctrine has fallen, but that is what those statements mean.  Yet the opinion does not argue that same-sex marriage is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” a claim that would of course be quite absurd. So would the further suggestion (also necessary, under our substantive-due-process precedents) that a world in which DOMA exists is one bereft of  “ ‘ordered liberty.’ ” Id. at 2706–07 (citations omitted) (quoting id. at 2695, 2693, 2692 (majority opinion); Washington v.

However, it is not clear how this discussion of the ills of substantive due process is related to the use (or not) of a specific standard of review since either identifying the rational basis for a law, or subjecting that law to strict scrutiny, is a judicial approach routinely used in both equal protection and due process cases.  168.

Nice correctly observed that “[j]ust as he had in Romer,” in Windsor Kennedy once again “simply elided the tired tiers that characterize judicial scrutiny as strict, intermediate, or rationality-based.  He similarly avoided the standard formula for determining whether a right is fundamental, apparently finding no need to reach that analysis, just as he had done in Lawrence.”172  This begs the question, “why?”  The answer to that inquiry also serves as further support for the conclusion that federalism played nothing more than a “fairly extended, but ultimately inconclusive and nondispositive” role in Windsor.173 Employment of rational basis review does not have to be a “conservative” judicial approach, as some commentators have described it.174  Admittedly, it might seem “conservative” because when the government’s actions are merely required to be “rationally related” to a “legitimate government interest” those actions will almost always be constitutional.  Indeed, one might say that typically rational basis review is a “feeble” level of scrutiny, in both “theory” and “fact.” 175   Justice Kennedy’s opinions in gay rights cases, however, consistently employ a flavor of rational basis review that is anything but feeble.  It is a standard of scrutiny accurately described as “rational basis with bite.”176  This reformulation of rational basis in equal protection cases emerged in the 1970s.  It was borne of the frustration of several justices who saw inadequacies in the existing approach of providing higher levels of scrutiny to those groups identified by a  justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html (emphasis added).   172.

For example, a 2012 Time magazine cover article pointed to the likely influence of Gordon Schaber upon Kennedy’s gay rights views.182  Schaber, who was Dean of the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento (where Kennedy has taught, in various capacities, since the 1960s), was “living the difficult secret life of a gay man in 1970s America.”183  Similarly, in a Reuters article that appeared in the Huffington Post on the eve of the Court’s October 2012 Term, Joan Biskupic suggested that interactions with gay Court employees might have positively affected the Justice’s views of the rights   177.

However, all of this misses a vital point about Justice Kennedy’s equal protection jurisprudence.  On one level, Professor Dorf’s quip is accurate.  “Anthony Kennedy has now firmly secured his place in history as ‘the first gay Justice’” 185  because of his opinions in Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor.  But, from Kennedy’s perspective, he is merely trying to guarantee equal treatment for all.  In other words, Pete Wilson was right, it does “strike . . . [Justice Kennedy] as terribly unfair that anyone’s individual potential should be in any way limited by their being classed as a member of a group, and treated in accordance with their group membership, rather than what they deserve to receive as individuals.”186 C.

That additional text is important because it speaks to the heart of Kennedy’s opinion and helps us to understand the shortcomings of the second federalism argument critiqued in this Article, the PrawfsBlawg commentary authored by Rick Hills.190 Professor Hills claims that Kennedy’s opinion is a “recognition that state law can define, at least in part, the scope of federal constitutional rights by (for instance) defining what constitutes an arbitrary classification under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause.”191  As a result, “the feds are more constrained by national constitutional rights than are the states.”192  The justification for such an approach – that “individual states can go different ways in deciding whether a particular classification is arbitrary” – reflects the idea of the states as little laboratories.193   In the famous words of Justice Brandeis, “[i]t is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”194  Justice Kennedy believes that the federal system of government in the United States is a well-functioning system when “two governments” succeed in providing the populace with “more liberty than one.”195  The dignity of individual citizens will be enhanced when there is at least one level of government that, in theory at least, does not seem alien, detached, and disinterested in hearing about, respecting, and protecting the interests of its citizens.196  In this respect, therefore, Professor Hills’s conclusion supports a federalism interpretation of Kennedy’s Windsor opinion.

He is more circumspect than Barnett; the question he asks is whether the “ghost” of Justice Harlan “smile[d] today, because Windsor vindicated” something that he advocated with particular vigor. 199   By this he means the second Justice Harlan’s commitment to “the idea that rights against the federal government ought to be construed more broadly than analogous rights against the state government.”200  The answer he gives is equivocal.  “Hints of Harlan’s theory” may “have been cropping up in a variety of [Supreme Court] opinions,” but Hills never quite says that such hints appear in Windsor.201  What he does say, however, is that Kennedy’s opinion in that case “fits within this longstanding idea that subnational law can influence the scope of federal rights.”202  Hills implies this means that the Court has not succumbed to the temptation of viewing the case through the lens of what Hills calls “rights fundamentalism”—“the notion that, because a right is very important, the right must be defined uniformly across jurisdictions.”203  Ultimately, however, Justice Scalia is correct that this is what his colleague’s opinion seems to do—even if it does so sub silentio, as the decision that did not bark. In his Windsor opinion Justice Kennedy emphasizes, time and again, what he said in Romer—that, “‘discriminations of an   197.  See United States v. Windsor, 133 S.

As Article VI of the U.S. Constitution informs us, that document is the “supreme Law of the Land,” and it guarantees that there are certain rights that “no state shall . . . abridge” (to employ the language of the Fourteenth Amendment).208  The devil is, of course, in the details, because what emerges from this simple truth is an important and far more complex question: what are the “rights of the persons” that all governments are constitutionally bound to respect? Justice Kennedy’s opinion in Windsor provides one obvious answer to that question, but it also refuses to acknowledge that it has done so.  Although it is not easy to clearly identify the jurisprudential path that Kennedy took in Windsor, his reasoning includes the following syllogism: – In the United States, marriage is an aspect of life traditionally regulated by the governments of the fifty states.  Many states have decided to “dignify” the “moral and sexual choices” of their gay and lesbian citizens by permitting same-sex couples to get married (and DOMA interferes with that sphere of state policymaking). – The U.S. Constitution “protects” those “moral and sexual choices.” – DOMA interferes with those choices, and is therefore unconstitutional.   204.

Oh, but wait. The opinion and holding in Windsor are explicitly “confined,” in their application, “to . . . lawful marriages.” 210   The opinion begs the question: what are the “rights of the persons” that the states are constitutionally bound to respect?  It also begets the conclusion that there are constitutionally protected “rights of the persons” that any state law banning gay marriage violates.  This is the “rights fundamentalism” which Professor Hills implies is absent from Windsor.211  In this respect, Windsor is, as Sherlock Holmes might have said, the gay marriage decision that did not bark.212 What Sherlock Holmes did say (at least, as he was portrayed on British television by Jeremy Brett) was that “the law is what we live with.  Justice is . . . harder to achieve.”213  It may seem glib to say that the “rights of the persons” that the states are constitutionally bound to respect are whatever rights a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court says that they are.  Yet, that is the reality – a reality that is also currently reflected in the narrower answer to the rights question.  They are basically whatever Justice Kennedy says they are. As Tom Goldstein remarked, “‘[t]he basic principle is, it’s Justice Kennedy’s world and you just live in it.’”214  Admittedly, Kennedy’s opinion in Windsor neither exhibits nor exudes the type of passionate commitment to libertarian (and/or egalitarian) principles that one finds in his writings for the Court in Romer and Lawrence.  It nevertheless indicates that in all likelihood it will not be long before the nation’s laws on same-sex marriage align with the promise of justice—the promise of “equal justice under law” that adorns the main portico of the home of the   209.

What remains to be seen is whether that alignment comes from We the People or from, as Justice Scalia fears, “We the Court.”215  Justice Scalia, along with Justices Thomas and Alito, viewed Windsor’s federalism references skeptically—just as they saw little more than fluffy rhetoric in the equal liberty discussions. 216   For example, Justice Alito asserted that the “whiffs of federalism” contained in the Court’s opinion would “soon be scattered to the wind.”217  For Justice Scalia, federalism was one of the opinion’s “rootless and shifting . . . justifications,”218 representing nothing more than a disingenuous effort by the majority to obscure its real agenda and to lay the groundwork for “the second, state-law shoe to be dropped.”219  Although Scalia was “only guessing”220 about his colleagues’ motives, his acerbic dissent demonstrated no doubts in his opinion.221  The majority’s ultimate goal is to invalidate state laws banning gay marriage, and that goal will be achieved very soon.222  “Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon,” and it will come in the form of a Supreme Court-issued judicial fiat, the consequences of which you, the nation’s disempowered citizenry, will have to live with “for the rest of your life.”223 It seems clear, from Romer, Lawrence, and now Windsor, that if such a decision comes from the Court it will include language and reasoning that will prompt “Harlan’s ghost [to] smile.”224  Not because of the inclusion of federalism language but, rather, because of the inclusion of reasoning reflective of Harlan’s libertarian views about due process.

Casey in 1992.226  Here it is worth quoting from the same passage of Harlan’s famous dissent in Poe v. Ullman,227 which Kennedy admiringly quoted in Casey.  In Poe, Harlan wrote: Due process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by reference to any code.  The best that can be said is that through the course of this Court’s decisions it has represented the balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for the liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of organized society. . . . The full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. . . . It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.228  Although Kennedy did not cite Poe in Windsor, the spirit of this passage runs through the 2013 opinion. 229   To conclude otherwise is to ignore the unequivocal nature of the following, which appeared on the penultimate page of that opinion: What has been explained to this point should more than suffice to establish that the principal purpose and the necessary effect of this law are to demean those persons who are in a lawful same-sex marriage.

The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains within it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection of the laws.  While the Fifth Amendment itself withdraws from Government the power to degrade or demean in the way this law does, the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment makes that Fifth Amendment right all the more specific and all the better understood and preserved.230 This might not be the “the money quote from the majority.”231  However, ultimately it might just be the one that pays the biggest, long-term dividends, because it makes it difficult to see how gay marriage bans can continue to coexist with the Constitution.  It also makes it difficult to agree with Professor Hills’s assessment that Windsor embraces a theory of federalism that permits “individual states . . .

THE HUMAN DIGNITY ROAD NOT TAKEN IN WINDSOR Some of the commentators who have recognized that federalism is not the key component of Justice Kennedy’s opinion in Windsor have sought to prove the existence of a different animating principle: dignity. 233   This is a principle that, like federalism, is something about which Kennedy feels passionately.  In the wake of Windsor, many people rushed to declare that the opinion’s “foundation . . . and its real importance, lie in its insistence on human dignity as a constitutional value”;234 that it   230.

Upon close examination it becomes clear that Kennedy generally is not referring to any kind of pre-political dignity in Windsor.  He is not referring to an inherent human dignity that exists quite apart from any form of civil society into which humans may or may not choose to enter.241  Instead Kennedy primarily emphasizes a form of dignity that only belongs to individuals when the State chooses to confer it upon them. 242   Commentators are correct that Kennedy’s opinion in Windsor “was based on the idea that it interfered with ‘the equal dignity of same-sex marriages.’” 243    235.

For, what Kennedy actually wrote was: “the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, a dignity conferred by the States.”244 Dignity is a “vague but powerful idea”245  with widespread appeal.  It is difficult to define; it is susceptible to multiple interpretations; it enjoys “non-partisan” 246  support precisely because people do not have to agree about its actual content and boundaries; and it is useful to all. It is useful to the individual when, in a specific instance, he or she believes they have been harmed by the government but cannot identify a legal right that was violated.  And it is useful for the government when it turns to the “dignity defense” in the absence of a more convincing and authoritative justification that has a statutory or constitutional basis.  This existence of multiple “use-categories”247 of the concept of dignity is reflected in Supreme Court opinions, which have featured hundreds of references to miscellaneous types of dignity.248  Over the years, however, two types of dignity stand out for having played large roles in opinions—human dignity and the dignity of states.249   244.

These observations come from a database I constructed that consists of the post-seriatim era U.S. Supreme Court decisions in which at least one opinion contained a standalone reference to the concept of dignity.  By standalone, I mean that when a judge writes an opinion in which he or she uses the concept of “dignity” to make a distinct point about his or her own arguments, this is considered a standalone use.  These differ from ‘dependent’ ones – which might include, for example, quotations from other opinions or from secondary sources, the descriptions of the holdings of other cases that explicitly rely on “dignity” or a related word, or simply references (usually negative ones in a separate opinion) to a judicial colleague’s invocation of the concept, see Helen J. Knowles, From a Value to a Right: The Supreme Court’s Oh-So-Conscious Move From ‘Privacy’ to ‘Liberty,’ 33 OHIO N.U. L. REV. 595, 598–99 (2007).  I did not confine my search to the word “dignity,” instead choosing to include the following related words: “indignity,” “dignified,” “undignified,” “dignities,” “indignities,” “indignation,” “indignant,” and “dignifies.”  This is because in order to give substance and meaning to a concept, one needs to look at the usage of related words that suggest or imply KNOWLESFINALEDITWORD.DOCX (DO NOT DELETE) 2/5/2015  3:24 PM 2015] TAKING JUSTICE KENNEDY SERIOUSLY 63 Arguably the most prevalent understanding of the concept of human dignity to appear in Supreme Court opinions is that which supports the idea that every person has, by virtue of being a human, a basic, inalienable dignity: “an intrinsic worth that should be recognized and respected” by all governments, no matter what.250  This pre-political dignity is part of the core of enumerated rights (rather than itself a constitutionally protected right)251 and is theoretically and morally linked to due process.  This is because, as William Parent points out, dignity and due process “are conceptually related through the mediating idea of arbitrariness.”252  If we focus on this concept of human dignity, it is easy to understand why scholars who contended that Kennedy’s opinion in Windsor is grounded in principles of federalism shied away from the “dignity” references as evidence to substantiate their arguments. 253   Over the course of the Supreme Court’s history, however, the other most common type of dignity to appear in the justices’ opinions—state dignity—offers a very different understanding of the concept, an understanding which might indeed support the Windsor federalism argument. Writing in 1793, in Chisholm v. Georgia, the first case to feature an opinion containing a standalone use of the word “dignity,” Justice James Wilson observed: “A State, useful and valuable as the contrivance is, is the inferior contrivance of man, and from his native dignity derives all its acquired importance.”254  Justice Wilson chose his words well.  The individual is more important than the State; a State is born from the decisions of individuals to form a political society.  Even after the creation of a State, the individual remains the primary political unit and  a violation or betrayal of the original concept.  250.  Gerald L.

This makes even more sense in a constitutional system, for as Walter Murphy has persuasively argued, constitutionalism “enshrines respect for human worth and dignity as its central principle.  To protect that value, citizens must have a right to political participation, and their government must be hedged in by substantive limits on what it can do, even when perfectly mirroring the popular will.”255  Over the course of its history, however, some members of the U.S. Supreme Court have described the state as a sovereign entity with a type of “dignity” entitled to legal protection—and sometimes the state has been afforded this legal protection in a manner that threatens the dignity of its citizens. This does not describe all state dignity references, but it is an understanding that is as prevalent for this type of dignity as is the pre-political understanding of human dignity. References to state dignity comprise only approximately eleven percent of all decisions containing at least one opinion including a standalone use of the concept of dignity.256   And, interestingly, there has been a clear downward trend in references to state dignity since a highpoint was reached during the period from the 1890s through the late 1930s.257  Nevertheless, in recent years the opinions penned in several high profile cases have suggested that the future might bear witness to a resurgence of interest in the state dignity concept.258  Describing a state as an entity whose sovereignty entitles it to legal protection of its dignity is reminiscent of the idea of sovereign dignity attaching to a monarch.  If human dignity is a founding principle of constitutionalism, then a tension arises between the dignity of a state and the human dignity of its populace.  Many of the more modern Supreme Court references to state dignity avoid this tension by departing from the monarchical analogy – they describe a dignified state as an entity that rules for the people, not over them. 259   This in part reflects the aforementioned twentieth   255.

It is not the dignity of gay and lesbian individuals that the federal statute negatively affects, but rather the dignity that their state afforded them by writing into its laws the right to marry the consensual adult partner of their choice, whether of the opposite or same sex. This reading of the majority of the opinion’s dignity references finds further support in the other passages listed in Table 1.  Passage 1 confirms that the dignity in question is a creation of the state because it is the dignity attached to a “lawful marriage.”275  As Passage 3 demonstrates, when we turn from dignity to “indignity” nothing changes – once again the subject at hand is a government-created entity.276   The only difference is that this time the entity is a law, and the issuing body is the federal government.  Similarly, in Passages 2, 4, 5, and 6 the “dignity” to which the Court refers is something that comes from the “State’s decision” to permit homosexual couples to marry.277 Passage 7 is susceptible to two different interpretations.  On the one hand, when the Court speaks of “enhanc[ing] the dignity and integrity of the person”278 it indicates that individuals have a dignity that is not the creation of the state.  Rather, it is an inherent human trait, the existence of which is neither derived from nor dependent upon any governmental entity.  On the other hand, however, the passage also indicates that human dignity can be shaped (in this case, positively) by state action, thereby suggesting that there is an element of that dignity which, ultimately, is state-conferred.

When one recognizes this it becomes easier to understand why the advocates of a “based on federalism”282 argument did not point to the discussions of dignity. The Windsor opinion’s two references to human dignity both clearly indicate the existence of an individualized, pre-political human dignity.283   The “class” mentioned in Passage A below consists of same-sex couples living in a State that has conferred upon them a legal right to marry.284  The “community” language can consequently be interpreted as referring to either the LGBT community or the broader “community” within which these couples live and interact.    279.

The community’s members have a “dignity,” the “recognition” of which was “enhanced” by the State’s decision to “[use] . . . its historic and essential authority to define the marital relation” as one recognized by law.287  As with Passage 7 in Table 1, Passage B in Table 2 is open to multiple interpretations.  An element of state-conferred dignity is present because of Kennedy’s statement that the “personal bond” between the two individuals in a same-sex partnership was “give[n] further protection and dignity” by New York’s decision to permit those individuals to get married or to recognize, as legally valid, a same-sex marriage into which they might have entered in a different jurisdiction.288  However, the operative word here is “further”; the state is giving “further   285.

Therefore, what United States v. Windsor truly stands for is the foreclosure, to any governmental entity, federal or state, of the power to diminish the pre-political dignity of individuals by treating them differently because of their sexual orientation.  The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, 289  which are “conceptually related” to dignity “through the mediating idea of arbitrariness,”290 demand no less.  And for a Kennedy-led majority, that is a conclusion at which the Court can arrive using (a) nothing more than rational basis review and (b) reasoning that stands “quite apart from principles of federalism.”291  What, then, does the future portend? V. CONCLUSION: LIFE AFTER WINDSOR “I suppose the sea change has a lot to do with the political force and effectiveness of people representing, supporting your side of the case?”292  During the oral argument in Windsor, Chief Justice Roberts put this question to Roberta Kaplan (who was arguing on behalf of Edie Windsor).293  Roberts never received what he considered to be a satisfactory answer to his question.  His tone suggested he was genuinely struggling to understand what accounted for the clear, positive change in the nation’s attitudes towards the rights of the LGBT community since the passage of DOMA in 1996.  “I am just trying to see how—where that that [sic] moral understanding came from, if not the political effectiveness of a particular group,” explained Roberts. 294  Responding to questions about the intent of Congress when it passed DOMA in 1996, Kaplan had earlier contended that “the only conclusion that can be drawn is what was in the House Report, which is moral disapproval of gay people, which the Congress thought was permissible in 1996 because it relied on the Court’s Bowers decision.”295  After observing that in Lawrence, the   289.

Even if there was disagreement inside the courtroom about why 2013 was not 1996, no one disputed that over the past seventeen years “enormous changes in the surrounding social and political contexts” had taken place and that “extraordinary developments [were] afoot with regard to attitudes and practices involving sexual orientation.”298 When the Court decided Lawrence on June 26, 2003, no state had legalized gay marriage.  Five months later, on November 18, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court announced its decision in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, holding that the state’s ban on gay marriage violated the Massachusetts Constitution.299  That ruling took effect on May 17, 2004, the date upon which the first same-sex marriages were conducted in the Bay State area.300  By the tenth anniversary of Lawrence, the poignant date upon which the Court chose to issue its decision in Windsor, gay and lesbian couples were able to legally marry in nine states and the District of Columbia. 301   And, within six months of Windsor, that number had jumped, quite remarkably, to fifteen states.302  Indeed, it seems certain that by the time this Article is published the number in the previous sentence will have   296.

A civil rights advocate is tempted to think, Vive la Fédéralisme!”303 “[C]autions are,” however, most definitely “in order,” 304 because just as easily as the American federal system can with one hand give liberty to the LGBT community, it can take it away with the other.  So many signs point to an immediate future in which we will see a continuing increase in the numbers of states legalizing gay marriage, and the percentage of Americans supporting not just that institution, but the extension of further civil rights protections to gays and lesbians.305  Although, it is undeniable that federalism has played positive and negative roles in the evolution of gay rights in the United States.306  As I have demonstrated in this Article, what the forces of federalism did not control was the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in United States v. Windsor, nor did they constitute the dominant theme in Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion in that case.  To conclude otherwise is to ignore the extent to which his opinions in Romer, Lawrence, and Windsor should be viewed together as a set of judicial writings—through which runs an abiding commitment to advancing the cause of equal liberty for individuals regardless of their sexual orientation. *** As a May 21, 1964 talking points memorandum from Bill Moyers to George Reedy indicates, the themes of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society speech were consciously long-term in nature.307  Of the eight points in the memo, four were expicitly focused upon the consequences for America beyond the election   303.

This has since changed—change has come incrementally, but it has come.  Therefore, while there is still much progress to be made, fifty years later we can look at the legacy of the Great Society and say that it was built upon key principles that are entirely consistent with the themes of equal justice under the law that represents the body and soul of Justice Kennedy’s opinion in Windsor.  In other words, upon close examination we can see that it is necessary to take Justice Kennedy’s own words seriously, because that opinion was indeed crafted “quite apart from principles of federalism.”311     308.
