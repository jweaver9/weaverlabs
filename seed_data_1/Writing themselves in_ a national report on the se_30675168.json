I remember when I was in about\ngrade 4-5, I would watch âBeyond 2000â for information on technological breakthroughs, etc.\nAt night, I used to make believe that Simon Reeve (one of the presenters) was my father,\nsnuggling up to him at night (like a baby). As far as I can recall, I didnât think there was\nanything majorly wrong with this, as this was sort of an âimaginary friendâ situation.\nWhen I was growing up, I was looked after very well by my mum, dad, grandparents and three\nsisters. As a family, we are reserved and passive, being Asian and Catholic. In primary school,\nI would always feel more comfortable playing âjacksâ, âelasticsâ or some other game with the\ngirls. I wasnât into football, cricket or basketball. As a result, I was teased by my male\nclassmates, always being called a âgirlâ. Looking back at those days, the insults were quite tame\ncompared to secondary school. Whilst in primary school, I did âlikeâ some people (boys) more\nthan others.\nWhen I went into year 7, I realised that there were more guys around me (and a greater\nvariety). If any time period can be pinpointed as the turning point, this would be it. By this age,\nI had heard and read a great deal about homosexuality, so I knew what was going on. I felt\nattracted to the âcuteâ guys in my class and year level. I would try to be friends with those I\nreally liked, but to them, I was just a fat Asian with glasses. Year eight was a terrible year. In\nmy class, there were 4 or 5 people who were always teasing me, for whatever reason they could\nfind. Mostly, it was the fact that I spoke like the âstereotypicalâ gay. Up until year 10, I took\neverything so seriously. I let the teasing get to me. I soon learnt to laugh. When someone called\nme a name, I would agree and make a joke out of it. This way, they could never be satisfied in\ntheir quest to visibly hurt me. It took the âstingâ out of their attack.\nYear 11 & 12 were the best years I have had. By this time, my fellow classmates and I knew\neach other much more and redefined our perceptions based on the whole person. I was\nconsidered as a kind and caring person who would lend a hand when needed. I like to believe\nthat people were less âscaredâ of me because they knew what (who) I was as a person. I wasnât\nteased anymore. At the beginning of year 12, I was having a discussion with a friend, who I\ntrusted greatly. We were asked to come up with a few words of wisdom about ourselves so, me\nbeing me, I thought âwhy not say âI am gay?ââ Using my better judgement, I decided against\nthis.\nNow that I am at uni, Iâm surrounded by guys. The thing is, Iâm attracted to those I consider to\nbe good-looking, even though I know nothing about them. Therefore, my whole life is based on\nlust at the moment. I consider myself to be ugly, Iâm overweight, short and very much a loner.\nIt seems very funny that I should be lusting after the cute and slim guys. I donât fit the\nstereotype for a âwantedâ gay male. I have next to no confidence in what I do, I feel\nuncomfortable around other people, I know Iâve got to do something about my weight, but Iâve\ngot no willpower. At the moment, Iâm happy with what Iâve done in this life, but at the same\ntime, unhappy with what Iâve done. The problem is, I try so hard to be noticed and liked by\nthose Iâm attracted to, but who would want a fat ugly Asian?\n(Quan, aged 19)\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 1\nExecutive Summary\nThis report is about young people who are attracted to their own sex. The need for accurate baseline\nfigures about young people of non-heterosexual orientation has developed as part of a general concern\nabout the spread of the HIV virus into the adolescent population and a specific concern around these\nyoung peopleâs emotional well-being. In the past three years, Australian adolescent research\nconducted by the National Centre in HIV Social Research, La Trobe University, has revealed that a\nsignificant minority of young people are not unequivocally heterosexual, with numbers ranging\nbetween 8 and 11% in recent research (Hillier et al, 1996, Lindsay et al, 1997).\nResearch which specifically targets this population has, until now, been conducted retrospectively\nand/or with people who identify as gay or lesbian recruited through gay and lesbian youth groups or\nthe gay press. As researchers we know little about young people at pre-identity or pre-disclosure\nstages because their need for anonymity means they cannot be contacted through the usual channels.\nThe young people represented in this project were accessed through an advertising campaign in\nNational magazines, via radio and the Internet . A survey was available on a website and from the\nCentre for the Study of Sexually Transmissible Diseases. Surveys were also inserted in the gay and\nstreet press.\nThese surveys sought information regarding sexual feelings and experiences as well as sexual and\ndrug-taking practices in regard to STDs (including HIV) and related diseases. The source and\nadequacy of sexual health information for this group and their levels of support and experiences of\nabuse and discrimination were also elicited. The survey also charted young peopleâs perceptions of\ntheir quality of life and emotional well-being. In addition, participants were also asked to write stories\nabout their experiences, including when they first knew about their sexual feelings, their relationships\nwith family and friends, and their hopes for the future.\nSeven hundred and fifty young people aged between 14 and 21 participated in the study (average age\nof 18). Although there were no gender differences in numbers (49% male, 51% female), the young\nwomen were, on average, six months younger than the young men.\nForty-two percent of the sample were attending a University or TAFE, whilst 31% were at school.\nThose attending school were almost exclusively in the 14-18 age group (97% or 228), and there were\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 2\nmore female students than male (35% or 132 females, and 27% or 101 males). Outside of schooling\n(secondary and tertiary), participants were most likely to be in full-time employment. One fifth (20%\nor 72) of all male participants were working full-time, while female full-time workers represented only\nhalf of this number (10% or 36).\nSexual Feelings\nParticipants were asked about sexual attraction, sexual identity and how they felt about their sexuality.\nWith regard to attractions, participants largely fell into two even groups: those who were exclusively\nsame-sex attracted (46% ) and those attracted to both sexes (46%). A minority of young people were\n'unsure' about their sexual attractions. Young women were far more likely than young men to be\nattracted to both sexes. Twice as many young men were only attracted to their own sex.\nWith regard to labelling their sexual identity, most respondents chose the categories 'gay/lesbian'\n(45%) or 'bisexual' (35%) with a sizeable minority selecting 'heterosexual' (9%). The remainder chose\n'other' (8%) or 'unsure' (4%). Young men were more likely to identify as 'gay' than 'bisexual' and\nyoung women in each age group were more likely to identify as 'bisexual' than 'lesbian'. Two thirds of\nthe group who said they were 'unsure' about their sexual identity were young women. The older age\ngroup (19-21 year olds) were more likely than the younger group (14-18 year olds) to identify as 'gay'\nor 'lesbian' (rather than 'bisexual').\nWhen asked âHow do you feel about your sexuality?â, one-third of the young people who answered\nsaid they felt 'great' and did not document problems. However, large numbers of those who said 'pretty\ngood' and 'ok' were experiencing a lot of difficulties. Sixteen percent of those who responded to this\nquestion were feeling very negative and despondent.\nTreatment by others\nThe survey asked about unfair treatment and any verbal and physical abuse suffered by participants\nbecause of their sexuality. Nearly one-third of participants believed they had been unfairly treated or\ndiscriminated against, because of their sexuality. Young men were more likely to be the target of\nverbal abuse, and 46% of participants overall stated they had been verbally abused. Thirteen percent\nof participants had been physically abused.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 3\nMore young people (70%) were abused at school than anywhere else, including the streets, with other\nstudents being the perpetrators for 60% of abuse cases. Ten percent had been abused by family\nmembers. Verbal and physical abuse had a profound effect on these young people. It affected their\nfeelings of safety at home and at school and was related to the use of drugs and a reduction in their\nsense of well-being.\nDespite these high levels of abuse, there is evidence that many young people are creatively using\nlimited resources, are thinking carefully about strategies to dismantle prejudice and are working for\nchange.\nSexual behaviour\nNearly three-quarters of participants had had sex (73%). One-third (33%) had had sex with both sexes,\nnearly half (45%) reported they had had sex with guys only and 22% reported they had had sex with\ngirls only.\nMore young women had had sex with both males and females, and nearly one-third of same-sex\nattracted young women had had sex only with males in the past year. Young women were more likely\nthan young men to be same-sex attracted, while at the same time only heterosexually active, although\na substantial number of young men were also heterosexually active.\nParticipants' reported use of condoms in heterosexual encounters was on a par with that of young\npeople in the general population. About 50% of young men reported 'always' using protection during\nsex, regardless of the gender of their sexual partner. Nearly 70% of young women reported they 'never'\nused protection in same-sex encounters.\nDrug use\nParticipants were asked about their use of a number of drugs, both legal and illegal. These young\npeople were far more likely to be using a number of illegal drugs than young people in the general\npopulation. Eleven percent of participants stated they had injected drugs and more of those were\nyoung women. The younger injecting drug users (IDUs) reported higher levels of sharing of injecting\nequipment than the older users.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 4\nThirty percent of participants had used party drugs, such as speed, ecstasy and LSD (acid). Sixty-two\npercent had smoked marijuana, more of whom were young women.\nDisclosure and support\nAn item in the survey asked about disclosure to a range of people and the level of support received.\nOne-fifth had never spoken to anyone about their sexuality. Although young people rarely sought\nsupport from professionals (doctors, youth workers, student welfare coordinators, teachers,\ncounsellors), when they were consulted these people were found to be, on the whole, supportive.\nYoung people were slightly more likely to disclose to family members than professionals. Mothers\nand sisters were more likely to be chosen to confide in than fathers and brothers. One in three had\nspoken to their mothers. Two-thirds of those who had spoken to mum found her supportive and half\nwho had spoken to dad found him supportive. Three-quarters of the young people who had told a\nsister found her supportive and two-thirds who had spoken to a brother had found him supportive.\nThree-quarters of young people had spoken to a female friend and two-thirds a male friend. Three-\nquarters found their female friends supportive, and two-thirds found their male friends supportive.\nYoung people who had disclosed their sexuality to at least one person were no more likely to feel\nbetter about their sexuality or their lives than young people who had not disclosed to anyone.\nHowever, young people who disclosed and received support did feel better about their sexuality than\nthose who did not.\nSexuality education\nInformation about heterosexual relationships and safe sex was easily accessed and readily available\nwith most young people learning about this topic from family, media, friends and 70% from school.\nHowever, rural young people reported less access to heterosexual safe sex information from the media\nthan young people living in metropolitan areas.\nInformation about gay and lesbian relationships and safe sex was far more difficult to access. Around\nhalf had received information about gay and lesbian relationships from the media and friends, one-\ntenth from the family and about 15% from school. At school, there was little information about gay or\nlesbian safe sex and the situation was even worse in the context of the family. Rural young people\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 5\nwere particularly disadvantaged compared with urban dwellers, with regard to access to gay\ninformation from all sources, and also access to information about gay relationships from school.\nImplications for practitioners working with Same-Sex Attracted Young People (SSAY)\nThis research has clear implications for all practitioners working with SSAY, particularly in the\ncontext of schooling.\nSexuality is a structuring force in the lives of all young people, and it is suggested that a framework\nwhich takes a whole school approach to supporting sexual diversity in all aspects of school life is\nneeded. Given the high levels of sexuality based harassment identified in this project, consideration\nneeds to be given to developing policy which explicitly addresses homophobia along with sexism,\nracism and other forms of violence. Equal Opportunity and Human Rights legislation provides a\nframework for policy development in this area. Young people who have suffered discrimination on\nthe grounds of their sexuality should also be made aware of their legal rights under this legislation.\nThis research has pointed to a dearth of information available to students on sexual diversity,\nincluding an absence of basic knowledge about STD prevention for all but heterosexual sex. When\nseeking to address this gap, schools need to avoid discussing homosexuality only in the context of\ndisease prevention.\nThis research has demonstrated that SSAY are heavily reliant on the media for information about\nqueer sexuality. Media representations of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people often draw\non a very limited range of negative and misleading stereotypes which can be interrogated within a\nsocially critical curriculum which includes teaching and learning around sexual diversity. Programs\nneed to be inclusive of all sexualities in order to ensure young people are not forced to seek\ninformation from less reliable sources i.e. media and friends.\nThis research has revealed that some young people who are exploring their sexuality will do so\nrelatively unproblematically, whereas others will require intensive support. Some young people will\nclearly identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, whereas others will experience homosexual behaviours\nand attractions as having little meaning for future identity. A number of SSAY will be labelled as gay\nor lesbian by their peers, while others will remain invisible. It is important for practitioners to\nacknowledge the heterogeneity of young peopleâs attractions and experiences, adopt a non-\njudgemental approach to sexuality, and avoid making assumptions.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 6\nLiving a queer lifestyle is not a concept which translates easily across a number of non-Western\ncultural boundaries. SSAY from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Backgrounds (CALDB) may\nneed specific support related to this issue. The research also produced evidence that SSAY from rural\nareas were particularly isolated and face a more severe information deficit than their urban peers, and\nthis issue needs attention at a local, State and National policy level.\nEncouraging SSAY to 'come out' is not necessarily the best solution. This research has demonstrated\nthat disclosure of sexuality only increases young people's well-being if the people they choose to\ncome out to are supportive. Sixty-five percent of the young people participating in this research were\nliving in the family home, many with a fear of violence or of becoming homeless should their\nsexuality be disclosed. What is important is providing a range of options: eg. access to gay, lesbian,\nbisexual adult role models; linkages to youth peer support groups and the opportunity to discuss\nsexuality in private and in confidence with a sympathetic and informed adult.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 7\nIntroduction\nIn this report we move the stories of Same-Sex Attracted Young People (SSAY) to centre stage in an\neffort to redress their invisibility, and to provide accurate information about their daily lives. The\nyoung people represented in this report struggle with issues concerning: family; friendship; school\nlife; sexual identity; loyalty and betrayal; fears and hopes; ways of surviving; and in some cases, their\nattempts at suicide, yet they also reveal the more positive and affirming aspects of sexual diversity.\nThey have provided a window to inner debates about the pros and cons of coming out, as well as\nfantasies and fears about people's reactions to that often hidden part of themselves, their sexuality.\nWithin the following pages, a grim picture of the hostility and SSAY encounter often co-exists with\ncreative and celebratory stories of resistance.\nAdolescence is depicted in popular culture and experienced by many young people and their families\nas a time of turmoil, partly because of perceptions of the range of risks and dangers that need to be\nsafely negotiated (Leeming, Dwyer & Oliver, 1996). Consequently, much has been written about the\nimportance of a positive affirming home and social life for young people, and we as a community like\nto think that we provide this. It is within supportive environments that young people learn about\nindependence, self-worth, skills for the future and intimacy in relationships.\nHowever, those who experience same-sex attraction are far less visible than young heterosexuals and\nare less likely to feel affirmed and supported throughout their teenage years or to have access to\npositive discourses in their peer culture about sexual difference. Hass (1979) noted that 11% of young\nwomen and 14% of young men aged 15 to 18 have had at least some homosexual experience, whether\nor not they associate this experience with 'being' homosexual. Often young people feel embarrassed,\nguilty or anxious about what meanings this holds regarding their future sexual identity.\nCondemnation, abuse, or dismissal of attractions and behaviours with the same sex as a 'phase' may\nprevent young people seeking help when this is needed.\nAdolescent theorists have also pointed to the many ways in which growing up gay, lesbian or bisexual\ncan be a particularly lonely and stressful time in comparison with the experiences of other minority\nyouth (Martin and Hetrick, 1988, Savin-Williams, 1990). Young people who are members of racial or\nreligious minority groups, most often share their status with their families and there is always that\nopportunity for affirming their identity. However, this is almost never the case for SSAY whose\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 8\nparents are overwhelmingly likely to be heterosexual. Telljohann and Price noted this when they\nwrote:\nThus the homosexual [and lesbian or bisexual] youth grows up without the sense of \"us\"\nversus \"them\" which is the essence of group identity afforded other minorities....Instead the\ngay youth is socialised into values and beliefs discordant with their self definition. (1993: 42)\nYoung people who are attracted to the âwrongâ sex often find they are forced to choose between two\nways of living their lives, neither of which necessarily promotes emotional or psychological well-\nbeing. The first is a life in a shadowy world of silence and denial in which 'passing as normal' requires\na constant monitoring of every word and deed. The second road of disclosure means risking rejection\nand the potentially negative reactions of friends, family and the community. Despite the popularised\nview of the positive social and psychological dimensions of coming out, research has demonstrated\nthat disclosure in itself does not necessarily enhance well-being (Savin-Williams, 1990).\nIt is not uncommon for young people to be rejected by the family when disclosures about sexuality are\nmade, and lesbian, gay and bisexual young people have been found to represent a higher than expected\nproportion of the homeless youth population (Hillier et al., 1997; Irwin, Winter, Gregoric & Watts,\n1995). SSAY may also be disadvantaged because of the lack of positive role models and information\nabout queer sexuality at home and in the school community. Because of widespread discrimination,\nfew gay and lesbian teachers are prepared to be open about their sexuality, or to pass on lesbian and\ngay friendly information (Jennings, 1994). Moreover, in sexuality education classes, gay and lesbian\nissues are rarely afforded the coverage given to heterosexual issues, leaving the real danger that these\nadolescents may be ill-informed about sexual health (Cranston, 1992, Uribe & Harbeck, 1992).\nResearch conducted in the United Kingdom, the U.S.A. and Australia attests to the greater likelihood\nthat SSAY will turn to alcohol and other drugs, as a way of alleviating the pain often associated with\nthese attractions (Sanford, 1989). Further to this, in recent years there has been mounting research\nevidence which demonstrates a link between homosexuality and suicide, particularly among young\nmen (Remafedi et al., 1997; Bagley and Tremblay, 1997; Rotheram-Borus et al., 1994; D'Augelli and\nHershberger, 1993). Several small Australian studies have supported the findings of this largely U.S.\ncentric body of work on youth suicide (Fordham, 1998; Emslie, 1996; Brown, 1996).\nThe need for accurate baseline figures about young people of non-heterosexual orientation has\ndeveloped as part of a general concern about the spread of the HIV virus into the adolescent\npopulation and a specific concern around these young peopleâs sense of emotional well-being. In the\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 9\npast three years, Australian adolescent research conducted by the National Centre in HIV Social\nResearch, La Trobe University, has revealed that a significant minority of young people are not\nunequivocally heterosexual with numbers ranging between 11% in recent rural research (Hillier et al,\n1996) and 8-9% in a large national survey of over 3,000 senior secondary students (Lindsay et al,\n1997). Research which specifically targets this population has, until now, been conducted\nretrospectively and/or with people who identify as gay or lesbian, recruited through gay and lesbian\nyouth groups or the gay press. As researchers we know little about young people at pre-identity or pre-\ndisclosure stages because their need for anonymity means they cannot be contacted through the usual\nchannels.\nAims of the research\nThe research was conducted with the following aims in mind:\nâ¢ To document levels of sexual and drug risk-taking by SSAY in regard to STDs (including HIV)\nand related diseases.\nâ¢ To investigate the adequacy of a number of potential sexual health information resources.\nâ¢ To document sources and levels of support available to SSAY in the course of their daily lives.\nâ¢ To document experiences of verbal and physical discrimination and abuse.\nâ¢ To chart perceptions of quality of life and emotional well-being.\nâ¢ To gather the personal stories of this group with a view to having their voices heard for change.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 10\nJim wrote...\nMy childhood up until I reached high school was pretty.good. I wasn't sporty or out going,\nbut I had a couple of close friends and.I enjoyed doing the stuff you do when you live in the\ncountry, yabbying, swimming in the river etc. I loved reading and I was top of the class\nacademically.\nWhen I entered high school everything changed. On my first day there a boy who was from\nout of town who decided because I wasn't wearing the same shoes as everyone else that I\nwould be his target to pick on. From that point my life very quickly became a nightmare. This\nboy was a natural leader and he soon had those whom mattered in the school pecking order\non his side and against me. Fairly quickly his focus came around to my sexuality. I'd known\nat that point I liked men, even fantasised about them but hadn't realised what it really\nwas...When the name calling started I then started to hate myself because although I was\ndenying everything they said I knew it was probably true. I believed at the time it was evil\nand sinful and dirty and people.like that would die from AIDS. I didn't want to be a faggot,\nbut every day other kids were reminding me that I was (whether or not they believed it\nthemselves).\nI never felt I could discuss this with any adults including my teachers. The only time I ever\ntold anyone that I was having problems was when I had a nose bleed that wouldn't stop\n(another kid had hit me in the locker rooms and the teacher had seen him). The teacher had\ntold me to forget about it.\nWhen I finally decided to end it all by swallowing tablets, that's when I was able to get some\nhelp. I talked to a counsellor who arranged for me to get away from the situation. I moved out\nof home into a refuge and started school in the city. Things were ok here but the other kids at\nthe refuge scared the shit out of me sometimes. They were pretty wild and expected me join\nin with them. I started smoking cigarettes, tried drinking alcohol and smoking dope...I must\nadmit I ended up enjoying the freedom I had in this situation, perhaps too much, and went\nwild myself for a time. In the end I was failing at my new school, and really didn't care... I\nended up running away and wound up living in the streets for about 6 months.\nTo cut a long story short, I ended up getting myself together and with.help from a fantastic\nwoman who took me in, going back to high school and getting my HSC and now I'm studying\nEconomics at Uni...\nThese days I'm in a relationship with a guy who I've been seeing for about a year. I'm fairly\nconfident about my sexuality and don't worry about people.finding out, although I can be\nnervous if I feel it's necessary to telI people I dont know. This is mostly the case with people\nof whom I may feel physically threatened, but has diminished since I began taking karate\nlessons as part of my fitness regime. As I get to a point where I feel I could physically defend\nmyself if the need arose (I hope it never does) I've developed more confidence in being\nmyself in any company.\n(Jim, aged 18)\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 11\nMethodology\nProject reference group\nA reference group was convened to guide the research team in developing the methodology and\nensuring that the project remained relevant to the needs of same-sex attracted youth. Government and\ncommunity representatives were invited in accordance with their expertise in working with young\npeople and their specific knowledge of sexuality issues.\nIn the initial stages of the project, the reference group provided particular support in: developing the\nrecruitment strategy for the project; honing the questionnaire design; providing feedback on publicity\nmaterials and piloting the questionnaire with young people.\nQuestionnaire design and development\nData was gathered for the project by means of a short questionnaire designed to generate a mixture of\nforced-choice and open-ended responses from young people, and was therefore qualitative and\nquantitative.\nFormat\nThe questionnaire was made available in 'hard copy' and electronic formats. The hard copy version\ncould be folded and sealed so it did not require a stamp if posted in Australia.\nThe electronic version, apart from slight changes in formatting, was identical to the hard copy version\nand was produced on the La Trobe University World Wide Web site as a 'mail-back form'. Young\npeople could complete the survey anonymously 'on line' via the World Wide Web then electronically\nmail it to the research team's alias e-mail address. To ensure anonymity was maintained, the mail-back\nprocess was configured to conceal participants' e-mail addresses.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 12\nTerminology regarding sexuality\nSexuality is a complex phenomenon, and the questionnaire was designed to explore that complexity.\nFor example, using the phrase 'same-sex attracted' was felt to be inclusive of a range of 'non-\nheterosexual' behaviours, feelings and identity labels among young people. Particular care was taken\nnot to make the assumption that same-sex attractions, feelings and behaviours necessarily lead to\ngay, lesbian, bisexual or other identities. The huge body of post-HIV/AIDS research in this country\nhas clearly established that same-sex desire (whether physical or emotional) and behaviour does not\nnecessarily lead to a more holistic sense of oneself as 'being' homosexual, gay or lesbian, bisexual etc.\nRather, the nature of the links between many different facets of young people's sexuality was sought.\nWhere respondents were asked about sexual identity, the options given were 'heterosexual', 'gay',\n'lesbian', 'homosexual', 'bisexual' and 'other'. The 'other' category allowed for self-generated labels\nrather than requiring that young people slotted themselves into the labels we had chosen.\nContent\nThe questionnaire was divided into nine subject categories:\nâ¢ 'About You' which requested demographic information;\nâ¢ 'About your Sexual Feelings'; which contained questions about sexual attractions, identities and\ngeneral feelings about being same sex attracted;\nâ¢ 'How do People Treat You', where young people could outline their experiences of abuse or\ndiscrimination and places in which these occurred;\nâ¢ 'About your Sexual Behaviours' which sought information about sexual activity and safe sex;\nâ¢ 'About your Drug Use' where items about alcohol, injecting, and use of other substances was\ngauged;\nâ¢ 'About your Family and Friends', where young people were asked about disclosure to and levels of\nsupport from various individuals in their lives;\nâ¢ 'Your General Well Being' which contained four items from an adapted scale of well-being;\nâ¢ 'Sex Education Information' where respondents could report sources of information regarding\nsexuality, as well as ask questions of their own they would like answered, and finally;\nâ¢ Young people were asked to tell their story about their experiences:\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 13\nWe want to know about your own story including when you first knew about your sexual\nfeelings, your experiences with friends and family, your good times and your bad, and your\nhopes for the future.\nInternet respondents were provided with a text box where this question could be completed on-line.\nPostal respondents were asked to enclose their stories within the survey booklet on a separate sheet of\npaper.\nPiloting\nThe questionnaire was piloted with groups of same-sex attracted young people accessed via the\nproject Reference Group in order to ensure that language used was clear and appropriate for the target\naudience, and questions were unambiguous.\nEthics\nThe questionnaire and research process conform to the ethical guidelines provided by the La Trobe\nUniversity Human Ethics Committee. Contact details for a nationally- accessible youth support\nservice were made available to all questionnaire participants. Information obtained remains\nconfidential, and where necessary, personal details have been changed in the writing-up process to\nprotect anonymity.\nSampling\nThe target group nominated for this project was young men and women between the ages of 14 and\n21. Given the exploratory nature of the research and the difficulties in reaching a potentially\nstigmatised and emotionally vulnerable population of young people, it was considered important and\nethical that participants self-select. The sample generated is not random, and no claim is made that\nresults can be generalised to the broader population of young people.\nEvery attempt was made to ensure that young people in all states and territories of Australia were\nsampled in proportion to the general population, with attention paid to attracting equal numbers of\nyoung men and women; and sizeable numbers of young people from both rural and urban settings.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 14\nRecruitment\nA priority established for the research was to make contact with young people who did not currently\nidentify with the queer community and who were isolated from support services. Following on from\nthis, publicising the project through the mainstream youth press was the favoured strategy.\nYoung people were recruited initially via national youth magazines and the Internet. The more popular\nyouth magazines and free music press are known to attract a diverse socio-economic cross section of\nyouth. The Internet was favoured as an initial recruitment strategy given that it provides anonymity.\nRecruitment commenced in January 1998, with the publication of the survey on the website; and\ncontinued through to the end of May 1998, at which time the web page was closed, the toll-free\nnumber was disconnected, and mail back of survey booklets ceased.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 15\nYouth Press\nCoupons appeared in the March 1998 issues of Dolly, Juice and Smash Hits magazines, under the\ncaption 'Who turns you on':\nThe coupons directed young people to the Internet address (URL) for the electronic questionnaire,\nprovided a nationally accessible toll-free phone number and gave a postal address for La Trobe\nUniversity. This allowed participants three options: going straight to the survey website; calling up\nand having a survey sent out ; or writing in to obtain the hard copy version.\nQuestionnaires were also placed as inserts into X-Press ; a free music-oriented youth magazine\navailable in Western Australia.\nInternet\nExtensive networking and liaison was undertaken on the Internet in order to ensure the questionnaire\nwebsite was publicised to as wide an audience of young people as possible. Generalist and queer\nspecific youth sites were targeted. The World Wide Web search engine Yahoo placed a link to the\nsurvey site in their 'Picks of the Week', which provided a great deal of exposure, as did a project\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 16\ndescription and front page link from the Australian Broadcasting Commission's youth radio station\nTriple J.\nA number of organisations were contacted by e-mail and consented to placing a hyperlink from their\nrespective websites to the survey URL on the La Trobe University website. These, along with mailing\nlists used to publicise the survey appear at Appendix One.\nFurther recruitment\nA second-stage recruitment strategy targeted young people already linked in with the gay community,\nqueer friendly support services, university campuses and youth agencies:\nâ¢ A questionnaire and project description appeared in the February and March 1998 newsletters\nissued by youth peak bodies in Victoria, NSW, Queensland, Northern Territory, ACT, South\nAustralia and Tasmania;\nâ¢ Sexuality officers on key University campuses in each state and territory were approached, and all\nconsented to make surveys available to students in Orientation and Sexuality weeks;\nâ¢ Surveys were included in a mass-mailout organised through the Australian Federation of AIDS\nOrganisations (AFAO);\nâ¢ Surveys were also placed as inserts in the following queer community publications:Brother Sister\nmagazine in Brisbane; the Sydney Star Observer and GT magazine in Adelaide;\nâ¢ Finally, the principal researcher was interviewed on Triple J .\nData analysis\nA number of statistical comparisons are made in this report, which include t-tests and chi-square\nanalyses. All significant differences reported are significant at p< .05. To ensure clarity and\nreadability for a diverse audience, the details of these analyses do not appear in the report.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 17\n1. Participant Profile\nDear La Trobe Uni,\nThank you for this survey because I have never been able to talk to anyone about this before. I\nam enclosing a sticky label with my name and address on it. I hope this helps you out a bit...\n(Greg, aged 15)\nResponse rates\nIt is impossible to calculate response rates for the project as there is no way of knowing how many of\nthe young people exposed to the questionnaire were eligible members of the target group.\nRecruitment via the Internet was the most successful method of accessing participants (see Table 2).\nOverall, the response to the advertisements in the youth press was disappointing. Only 266 people\nAustralia-wide, 175 of whom were young women, sent in or phoned to have a survey posted out. Only\n160 completed surveys arrived in response to a magazine coupon. Eleven questionnaires were returned\nmarked 'Not known at this address'.\nInvalid questionnaires\nSeveral hundred invalid surveys were received, largely due to the anonymous nature of the recruitment\nprocess. With the advent of the link from the 'Yahoo' search engine, the overseas audience for the\nsurvey greatly expanded. Large numbers of otherwise valid questionnaires from young people outside\nof Australia were received, which unfortunately had to be discarded. Some of the reply-paid\nquestionnaires were sealed and posted by ineligible members of the public who came across them in\nthe West Australian free press and the gay press in Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide. A sizeable number\nof young people who claimed no same-sex experience or attractions and identified as heterosexual\nsubmitted surveys electronically. In many instances, the motive for this was to demonstrate support for\nsame-sex attracted peers. In a small number of cases, homophobic or obscene intentions appeared to\nbe motivating completion of the questionnaire.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 18\nReason invalid Via Internet (n) Via mail (n)\nParticipant too old 37 32\nParticipant too young 8 -\nHeterosexual on all sex. variables 45 56\nAbusive response 5 7\nBlank, illegible or incomplete\nresponse 23 11\nOverseas respondent 309 2\nArrived after closing date - 28\nTotal 427 136\nInvalid surveys n = 563 Total surveys received (valid and invalid) n = 1312\nTable 1.

The sample was skewed towards the older\nage groups. The average age of participants was 18 years, and for the purposes of analysis this was\nused as the mid-point with which to divide the sample into a younger and older age group.

This indicates that young people from rural\nareas are over-represented in the sample population (McLennan, 1997).\nEducation and work status\nThe question âWhat are you mainly doing at the moment?â revealed that almost three quarters of the\nsample (73% or 549) were attending an educational institution. Forty-two percent were attending a\nUniversity or TAFE, whilst 31% were at school. Those attending school were almost exclusively in\nthe 14-18 age group (97% or 228), and there were more female students than male (35% or 132\nfemales, and 27% or 101 males). The significant difference between numbers of females and males\nstill at school can be attributed to some extent to the observed age difference between male and female\nrespondents. Outside of schooling (secondary and tertiary), participants were most likely to be in full-\ntime employment. One fifth (20% or 72) of all male participants work full-time, while female full-time\nworkers represented only half of this number (10% or 36).\nFigure 3.

Less popular accommodation options included: living on own (5%); at a girlfriend/boyfriendâs\nhouse (4%); at a relative's home (3%), or in a boarding house or dormitory (3%). Less than two\npercent of the sample were living in a refuge or on the streets. There were no gender differences with\nregard to living circumstances, however, as would be expected, the younger age group were more than\ntwice as likely to be living at home (67% compared with 33% of 19-21 year olds).\n_____________________________________________________________________\nNina wrote...\nWhen I was seven, my parents separated and I swapped from house to house with my brother\nevery week. Some time after that, my mother entered into a relationship with a woman. They\nmoved in together (the 3 of us with my mum's partner and her son), and remain together till this\nday. They recently celebrated their 10 year anniversary. So, you see, all but a few of my\nmemories are of growing up in a home full of great love and devotion, of openness and self\nexpression. This was a great gift (one that few of my friends can boast) that my mothers gave to\nme.\nI went out with boys quite actively and didn't really consciously think a lot about it. I followed\nthe trend at that stage in most things. I never found those 'relationships' (if one could call them\nthat!!) as rewarding and as tangible as any platonic friendship I had with girls although I had\ngreat guy friends too. I realised at age 15 that I was successively 'falling' for more and more\nunattainable guys. Funny that. I was getting more involved in the gay community through\nsocial events with my mum and I was becoming closer to her friends, too, as I grew up more,\nand knowing more about their lives.\nAnd my gorgeous best friend Tina and I at that age were very close. People fell for her all over\nthe place. We spoke about everything. She knew about my mum, so the topic came up quite a\nbit. We began this game sort of thing of touching each other casually in public more often than\nnecessary and teasing each other about secretly having a relationship. She loved it. I loved it,\nbut for different reasons I later found out.\nEffectively, she started a rumour. That's when I started getting shit at school for being a dyke.\nShe got nice rumours, because she was hot, she was a model and she had a boyfriend. I got\ndumped, bullied and was still single. She changed schools. We drifted. I never told my mum\nabout her, nor about the other emerging feelings that came up everywhere in my life.\nI wanted to talk to my mum about all this SO much, but just couldn't. My close friends\nhelped out, I was happy, but still it bothered me and still does that I can't tell mum. Maybe\nit's simply that I don't want her to ever be disappointed if I don't live up to any safe idealistic\nlabel she'll automatically want to give me despite herself. Just plain gay, like her. It's not me\nright now. We all want labels - me too usually. I know I'm not straight, and I guess I'm\nprobably bi. queer. I dream of guys and girls, I check out both sexes, blah blah blah. I have\nthe potential to love anyone. Right now, I'm happy, I'm me and I love someone who happens\nto be male. So label me, but right now I don't feel the need to label myself. At this time of\nmy life, I'm not just plain anything.

About Your Sexual Feelings\nI think that it's because we're all expected to be hetero and being gay is unusual or weird or\nwrong that makes it much harder to come to a decision. I want to not have feelings for girls, so\nthat I don't become the unusual or weird or wrong one, but I know they make me feel happier\nto be with. I just wish the whole gay or hetero - you must be one or the other - thing didn't\nexist. (Jodie, aged 16)\nKey Findings\nâ¢ Young women were far more likely than young men to be attracted to both sexes. Twice as many\nyoung men were only attracted to their own sex.\nâ¢ Young men were more likely to identify as 'gay' than 'bisexual'.\nâ¢ Young women were more likely to identify as 'bisexual' than 'lesbian'.\nâ¢ Two thirds of the group who said they were 'unsure' about their sexual identity were young\nwomen.\nâ¢ The older age group (19-21 year olds) were more likely to identify as 'gay' or 'lesbian' (rather than\n'bisexual') than the younger age group (14-18 year olds).\nâ¢ Young women in each age group were significantly more likely to identify as 'bisexual' than\nyoung men.\nâ¢ When asked 'How do you feel about your sexuality?', one third of the young people who answered\nsaid they felt 'great' and did not disclose problems. However, large numbers of those who said\n'pretty good' and 'ok' were experiencing a lot of difficulties. Sixteen percent of those who\nresponded to this question were feeling very negative and despondent.\nSexual attractions\nIn Section two of the questionnaire, young people were asked about sexual attractions and about how\nthey labelled their sexuality.1 The distinction between these two aspects of sexuality is particularly\nimportant given that research has confirmed a human capacity for varying degrees of same-sex\nattractions and sexual activity, which may or may not result in self-identity as a homosexual. (Kinsey\net al., 1948, 1953; Savin-Williams, 1990). Recent Australian HIV/AIDS research with populations of\nadult men (e.g. Bartos et al., 1993) has confirmed that homosexual behaviours do not necessarily give\n1 Questions regarding sexual behaviour and safe sex were grouped together in a later section of the survey.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 24\nrise to 'gay' identity as such, in terms of the meanings which individuals attach to their attractions and\nbehaviours.\nWhen asked to describe feelings of sexual attraction at the moment, participants largely fell into two\neven groups: those who were exclusively same-sex attracted (46% ) and those attracted to both sexes\n(46%). A minority of young people were unsure about their sexual attractions (7%), and an additional\none percent were only attracted to the opposite sex 2 (see Figure 4).\nGender differences were highly significant with regard to this question. Sixty percent of young men\nyet only 32% of young women stated they were exclusively attracted to their own sex. The reverse\nwas true of respondents attracted to both sexes. Young women were also more likely to be 'unsure' of\ntheir attractions, in that they accounted for 61% of this group. Equal and relatively small numbers of\nyoung people of both sexes claimed exclusively heterosexual attractions (1%).\nThere was a significant, yet weaker correlation with regard to age of participant and sexual attractions,\nwith a trend towards a decrease in attraction to both sexes, as age increased. In other words,\nparticipants in the 14-18 age group were significantly more likely to claim attractions to both sexes\nthan those in the 19-21 group. There were, however, significantly more young women than young men\nin the 14-18 group.\n2 These young people indicated 'non-heterosexuality' in other questions, e.g. with regard to their behaviours or\nfantasies.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 25\nFigure 4.

participants to consider how they labelled their sexual identity.\nAccording to Savin-Williams (1989), sexual 'identity' represents a consistent, enduring self-\nrecognition of the meanings attached to sexual orientation and sexual behaviour. The three aspects\nmay be only somewhat or highly correlated. Troiden (1989) noted there are three components to a\nsexual identity: self-perceptions; perceptions of others; and presentation to others. He also believed\nsexual identities to be most fully realised when those three aspects coincided for the individual.\nHowever, for other writers such as Fuss (1991), the whole notion of a fixed 'sexual identity' is\nproblematic. In this formulation, identity is perceived as more of an ever-emergent phenomenon,\ncharacterised by flux.\nMost participants chose the categories 'gay/lesbian' (45%) or 'bisexual' (35%) with a sizeable minority\nselecting 'heterosexual' (9%). The remainder chose 'other' (8%) or 'unsure' (4%). Significant gender\ndifferences were also observed with regard to these responses. Following a similar pattern to the\nquestion on sexual attraction, young women were much more likely to identify as 'bisexual' than\nyoung men (61% vs 39%). Young women also accounted for: 63% of the heterosexual identity\ncategory (compared with 37% of young men); were more likely to state they were 'unsure' about\nidentity; more likely to nominate the 'other' category and, more likely to prefer an alternative, self-\ngenerated identity label to those on offer (e.g. 'queer').\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 26\nFigure 5.

age and sexual identity, which followed a similar pattern to the\nquestion on sexual attraction: i.e. an observed trend towards an exclusively 'gay' or 'lesbian' identity in\nthe older age group. Participants in the younger age group were more likely to identify as\n'heterosexual' or 'bisexual' than those in the older age group (see Figure 6).\nThese data support a trend away from bisexuality among older respondents toward a self-label as gay\nor lesbian. A little more than half of the 19-21 year olds identified as exclusively gay or lesbian\n(51%), and older respondents were more likely than the younger group to select the 'other' category. In\nthe space provided on the questionnaire, a number of participants (of all ages) elaborated on their\nchoice of 'other':\nAttracted to males physically, but prefer the emotional and spiritual support of females.\nDespite attraction to males, would never start any relationship with them. Very hard to\nexplain, but itâs sort of a natural instinct to back away from them. (Gayle, aged 19)\nFluid (I donât like boxes). Whatever feels right at the time.

asked to consider factors influencing how they labelled their sexuality (see\nFigure 7). This was a multiple-response question, and most young people who answered the question\nchose several of the possible options. Basing identity on 'sexual attraction' was the most popular\nresponse (75%), with 'fantasy' (66%) and actual 'sexual experiences' (51%) also nominated by\nsubstantial numbers of respondents. There was also a considerable number of unspecified 'other'\nresponses (5%). There were few gender differences with regard to choice of the above categories,\nalthough young men were more likely than young women to say they 'just knew' about their sexual\nidentity (56% vs. 44%) and young women were more likely than young men to say they hadn't defined\ntheir sexuality yet (27% vs 17%).\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 28\nFigure 7. Factors influencing labelling of sexuality.\nIdentities in transition?\nThe large numbers of young people, particularly young women, who identified as bisexual in this\nstudy deserves some consideration. The 'master narrative' (Diamond, forthcoming) or stage theory\napproach to homosexual identity development (Troiden, 1989, Cass, 1979) explains bisexuality quite\nunproblematically as a transitional or 'identity confusion' phase between heterosexuality and\nhomosexuality, which individuals progress through on the way to a 'fully integrated' identity. This is\nclearly how bisexuality is experienced for some participants; as one young man noted in talking about\nhimself at an earlier age: 'I was denying the gayness that was developing quite a bit by compromising\nfor bisexuality'.\nIt is true to say we have no way of knowing how these same young women and men would label their\nsexuality were this survey to be conducted in several years time, and as mentioned above, there was a\ntrend away from identifying as bisexual among the older group.

29\nIdentities...are less about expressing an essential truth about our sexual being; they are more\nabout mapping our different values: the values of relationships, of belonging, of difference\nand diversity. They provide continuous possibilities for invention and re-invention, open\nprocesses through which change can happen. (Weeks in Parker and Gagnon eds., 1995: 44)\nIndeed, there are other possible readings for these results, which depend entirely on how linear, fixed\nand 'essential' one considers homosexual identity to be. Paula Rust (1993), understands bisexuality as\nan identity which can flourish under social conditions that do not require a polarisation of oppressor\nand oppressed3. A number of young women and men elaborating on a bisexual identity were quite\ncomfortably assuming this label, did not appear at all confused and described supportive and\nprogressive family and friendship networks:\nI know a lot of gay people suffer from problems due to harassment and abuse, perhaps I just\ngrew up in a well educated home, school and general environment. When I was 10, I had my\nfirst encounter with a girl...Since then, I have had a string of male and female partners...I am\nnow in my final year of high school and things are going well. I am glad so many people in my\nlife have been supportive... (Amy, aged 17)\nIt should be noted, however, that 'bisexual' meant many things to the participants in this study, in\naddition to the celebratory sentiments expressed above. It meant: 'Confused because I'm in love with\nmy best friend, but I've only had sex with boys'; 'How do I explain the fact that I just got drunk and\nkissed a boy/girl at a party'; 'I like girls a lot better than boys but I also want to have children'; or 'What\nif it's only this girl/boy and not any others?'\nThere was evidence too that young people claiming a bisexual identity were doubly stigmatised in that\nthey encountered resistance within heterosexual peer networks and the wider gay and lesbian\ncommunity:\nI find being bisexual, I'm misunderstood by my friends. A lot of gays and lesbians that I know\nthink that I have not decided which side of the fence I should be on. This is not true, I just\ngenuinely enjoy both sexes. I support gays and lesbians and they should also understand more\nabout bisexuality. (Chloe, aged 21)\n3 The rise of 'queer' as a politics and critique of identity categories within progressive 'non heterosexual' culture\n(see Jagose, 1996 for an elaboration of the variety of uses to which this term is put.) also suggests that we are\nbeginning to live in an era where the oppositional categories 'homosexual' and 'heterosexual' are beginning to\nbecome less relevant.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 30\nAnother young woman stated that bisexuality was considered 'try hard lesbianism' among the lesbians\nat her school.\nThe above examples suggest that a sense of movement toward the 'queering' of Australian society is\nhappening on a small scale for our research participants, and predominantly for those from well-\neducated, socially progressive families and environments. In the absence of wide-spread public\naffirmation for homosexuality, confusion rather than a sense that identities and attractions are 'fluid'\nprevails for many, particularly the younger participants in this study, and was a far more common\nreaction to having attractions for or experiences with both sexes. Stage theories of sexuality, (e.g.\nTroiden, 1989) are still relevant, in so far as they emphasise the stigma attached to homosexuality\nprevalent in the community at large and the resulting fear and uncertainty potentially produced for\nyoung people exploring 'non-heterosexual' sexuality. The persistence of such social stigma was further\nemphasised in responses to the next question.\nHow do you feel about your sexuality?\nSeems to me once the inside battles subside, you are met with outside battles in society. You\nhave to be really strong to be gay and out and happy.\n(Eric, aged 16)\nThe last question in the 'About your sexual feelings' section gave participants an opportunity to say\nhow they were coping generally with sexuality issues on a scale from 'great' to 'really bad'. There was\nan additional open-ended section, where the majority chose to qualify their answer. These qualitative\nresponses were subsequently coded into the following categories:\nâ¢ Personally accepting of sexuality and mentions acceptance by peers and family.\nâ¢ Feels good personally about sexuality but some concern with the negative consequences at a\nsocial and interpersonal level.\nâ¢ OK personally with sexuality, but feels the need for freedom from rigid categorisation.\nâ¢ OK, but isolated and lacking support.\nâ¢ Expresses confusion and doubts, mostly but not completely negative.\nâ¢ Has great difficulty with accepting same sex attractions and feels terrible.\nNearly one-third of respondents (32%) said they felt 'great' about their sexuality. Almost as many\nyoung people selected each of the 'pretty good' (28%) and 'OK' (30%) categories. Seven percent said\nthey felt 'pretty bad' and the remaining three percent said they felt 'really bad'.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 31\nMost respondents who chose great also made positive statements about acceptance of sexuality by self\nand others (63%) or chose to focus on disliking rigid categorisation of sexuality (16%) . However,\nmany of the pretty good and OK respondents had experienced a number of difficulties. Only one-third\nof those who selected 'pretty good' and one-fifth of those who selected OK felt that sexuality was\nunproblematic in their lives. Those who qualified their answer had come to terms to some extent with\ntheir sexuality, but had experienced isolation, confusion or concern about the negative societal and\ninterpersonal consequences of identifying with a stigmatised sexuality.\nOf particular concern were the 16% of young people who wrote answers which indicated they felt\nmostly negative or were really not coping with sexuality issues. For the most part, being treated badly\ncombined with a sense of overwhelming isolation had led to these feelings.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 32\nHow do you feel generally about your sexuality?\n'Great'\nBefore I was out to family and friends, my greatest fear was being found out or being asked\n\"Where's your girlfriend?\", and you think \"I'm the only one going through this\",\n\"Who can I tell?\", \"Why can't god make me normal?\". And then for me personally,\nI just came to a day when I said enough is enough and I took the plunge and had sex\nwith a guy (YAHOO!)...There's no more 'maybe I am, maybe I'm not\", it's just \"Yes, I'm gay!\".\nI know it now. The next most important thing for me was a support group for gay youth...\nOnce the support, education and information was layed out in front of me and\nI met other gay people, I realised that...I was going to \"come out\" of this OK..\n.Cheers! (Liam, aged 20)\n'Pretty Good'\nIt's very hard to establish relationships without being chastised...in the community.\nEspecially in a small country town. Feelings get held back, squashed, guilt rises...\nbut I am not attracted to gender, I am attracted to a person, male or female. Just society's\nexpectations hamper efforts to break from traditional moulds. I was a member of a\ngay support group and was chastised for not being a real lesbian because I liked men...\nI feel like I'm in limbo...floating around between the two, not finding acceptance,\nor the love I crave. (Sasha, aged 20)\n'OK'\nIt's OK, I'm trying to deal with it, but it's hard if all your friends are straight and you\ndon't feel you can discuss it with any of them. Loneliness is the hardest part.\n(Max, aged 16)\n'Pretty bad'\nIt makes me feel uncomfortable. I have felt this way for as long as I can remember, but\nit still doesn't feel normal. Only my family know. They reacted so badly, I haven't told\nanyone else. (Lina, aged 19)\n'Really bad'\nI felt that the feelings I was having were bad. People that were my friends began to treat\nme badly because of my feelings. One day about a year ago, I was caught kissing another\ngirl by my friends. The next day at school, people were staring at me, talking about me.\nSomeone spray painted the word 'lesbian' on my locker. My friends didn't\neven want to talk to me. (Fiona, aged 17)\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 33\n3. How Do People Treat You?\n...the first person I told I was gay betrayed me by telling all my friends. They in turn verbally\nand emotionally abused me until I was feeling so low I thought I was having a nervous\nbreakdown. I basically left school. (Ivan, aged 16)\nKey Findings\nâ¢ Nearly one-third of participants believed they had been unfairly treated or discriminated\nagainst, because of their sexuality.\nâ¢ Young men were more likely to be targeted for verbal abuse, and 46% of participants overall\nstated they had been verbally abused.\nâ¢ Thirteen percent of participants had been physically abused.\nâ¢ Almost 70% of the abuse disclosed had taken place at school, which means that school is a\nmore violent place for these young people than the streets.\nâ¢ Nearly 60% of those abused stated other students were the perpetrators.\nâ¢ Abusers also included family members in 10% of cases.\nâ¢ Despite these high and unacceptable levels of abuse, there is evidence that many young\npeople are creatively using limited resources, are thinking carefully about strategies to\ndismantle prejudice and are working for change.\nDuring past research projects, we have observed that many young people display overtly homophobic\nattitudes. Anyone suspected of being same-sex attracted may be threatened, assaulted and excluded\nfrom activities by peers, particularly in the school environment. We were interested to find out about\nthe impact of these attitudes and behaviours on our target group, including their perceptions of\ndiscrimination based on their sexuality.\nDiscrimination\nAlmost one third (29%) of the research participants reported that they had been unfairly treated\nbecause of their sexuality. Another third (33%) reported that discrimination was not possible because\nno one was aware of their sexuality and the remaining 38% felt that they had received no unfair\ntreatment.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 34\nResponses to an open-ended item asking for more information about the unfair treatment, revealed a\nrange of discriminatory practices at school and in the workplace, for example, one young man wrote:\nâIâm not allowed to go in the male change roomsâ. There were a number of young people who were\nforced to change schools because life became too difficult for them and one who had lost a job\nbecause of his sexuality. Others mentioned not being able to take a same-sex partner to the school\nformal and girls discussed not being able to wear dress suits to the school dance as one way in which\nthey were treated unfairly.\nOther young people described legal discrimination including not being able to get married and cases\nwhere their partners were prevented from accessing Austudy. A very insightful comment was made by\none 15 year old girl who said: âNot many people know, but I think that being brought up straight and\ntaught that straight is right is a form of abuseâ. In many ways these young people were well aware that\nthe rules were different for people who had sexual partners of the same sex. There were also many\nexamples throughout these young peopleâs stories of discrimination or fears of discrimination by their\nfamilies such as partners not being recognised.\nVerbal and physical abuse related to sexuality\nAnother related item on the questionnaire which was concerned specifically with verbal and physical\nabuse as a result of sexual orientation added significantly to our picture of the hostile environments\nthat many of these young people were living in. Almost half (46%) had been verbally abused, and\nmore of these were boys (52% vs 39%). Examples of verbal abuse fell into three categories; single\nword stereotypical remarks, two word insults and threats of violence. The main type of verbal abuse\n(80%) was in the form of single stereotypical comments, such as, âpoofterâ, âdykeâ and âfaggotâ.\nThese remarks were more likely to be directed at boys, however girls were also targeted in this way.\nTwo word insults were also a common form of verbal abuse, and âleso trashâ, âqueer bitchâ and âcock\nsuckerâ were typical examples. Threats of violence were the most severe forms of verbal abuse\ndescribed by the participants, and these had been directed at a smaller but sizeable number of the\ngroup, more of whom were young women (18% vs 11%).\nThirteen percent of the young people in the study reported being physically assaulted because of their\nsexual orientation. When asked to write about the assaults, they described a range of violent attacks.\nSome of these attacks were single incidents, such as, âGot my arm brokenâ and others constituted\nsystematic abuse, such as, âI had rocks thrown at me every day on my way home from school'. Many\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 35\nrecalled abuse at school, for example: âPunched discretely while teacher wasnât looking' or 'Broken\nbones in my fingers when a desk lid was slammed on my handâ.\nIn order to build a better picture of the context of the verbal abuse and physical assaults that these\nyoung people were subjected to we asked two further questions. The first concerned the place at\nwhich the abuse occurred and the second, the person who was responsible. On average, each young\nperson described two separate locations (603 reports, 327 respondents). Their responses indicated that\nthe place at which the abuse was most likely to occur was school (69%) with boys more likely to be\nabused there than girls (81% vs 53%). The streets were the second most likely place of abuse (47%)\nfollowed by social (34%) and sporting events (9%). Abuse was reported less frequently at work,\nchurch and on public transport (total of 11%). Fifty-nine percent of those who had been verbally or\nphysically abused named other students as the perpetrators. Added to this, 10% named friends, some\nof whom were also likely to be school students. Forty-four percent named strangers as the perpetrators\nand 10% named their family members.\nGiven that young people are mandated by law to attend school, the finding that school is the place\nwhere most abuse occurs represents a serious violation of these young people's rights to safety and of\nthe duty of care of school authorities. Thirty-three percent of young people said they hadnât been\nabused, although many qualified this by adding that this was because no one knew about their\nsexuality. There was plenty of evidence that this group was not safe from concerns about abuse if\nanyone found out about their sexuality:\nI am most afraid about what will happen at school. I know that I will get verbally harassed a\nhell of a lot but Iâm hoping physical abuse wonât happen. (Mei, aged 16)\nI havenât told anybody at all. Rejection and homophobia is still rampant in the playground and\nin ordinary families. I donât know if anyone has guessed but I know I would lose most of my\nfriends if I were to disclose it. (Tran, aged 15)\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 36\nResisting discrimination and abuse\nOne could be forgiven, given the descriptions above of discrimination and abuse directed at same-sex\nattracted youth, for imagining them as passive victims. Though there is clear evidence in our data that\nmany young people were hunted out of their schools and driven to attempts at suicide, the stories they\ntell show that many of them did not accept the negative labels or the abuse. Many of these young\npeople were creatively using limited resources, were thinking carefully about strategies to dismantle\nprejudice and were working for change. 'Chrissie's story' on page 39 was an example of the extent of\nthis persistence.\nIn the first instance, a number of young people were learning self-defence in order to protect\nthemselves in the event of physical assault. In terms of resistance also, there was extensive evidence in\nthe stories and open-ended answers that these young people were using discourses around\nhomophobia to deflect negative attitudes and behaviours away from themselves and back to the\nsource. In other words, they were problematising people who couldnât deal with their sexuality rather\nthan problematising themselves. We found that a number of young people were using quite\nsophisticated critiques of heterosexuality to resist the negative attitudes of people around them:\nHow many straight kids have to inform their family of this fact? How many parents say to\ntheir straight children âI think you should have sex with someone of the SAME sex before you\ndecide youâre straight? Iâd say none but swap it around to being queer and all of a sudden you\ndonât know your own mind and have to justify yourself - constantly. (Jo, aged 20)\nAs 20 year old Carlie said: I've come to realise that ALL of my friends and family are homophobic. In\nsaying this, Carlie was able to explain the negativity of those around her, without taking on their\ncriticisms as truths about her own sexuality. Even without the use of the term homophobia, many\nyoung people were able to separate out their own feelings about their sexuality from the negative\ndiscourses around homosexuality they were subject to within their peer culture. In this way, they could\nkeep themselves safe. This was even true of some of the youngest participants in the study. For\nexample, 15 year old Warwick wrote: 'Society makes it not great so I don't feel great. If society\naccepted it, I would feel great.' Similarly Rhyll, who was 17 explained: 'It's hard because I can accept\nwho I am, and I like liking women, it is just those who don't understand, and don't want to, that make\nit hard for me to openly be who I am.'\nMany of these methods of resistance were found in the explanations young people gave to the item\nwhich asked how they were feeling about their sexuality. On reading these responses it was clear that\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 37\nthose who felt better about their sexuality were far more likely to be recognising and struggling\nagainst what they perceived as injustice in their daily lives. Furthermore, there were far fewer\nexamples of resistance from young people who felt bad about their sexuality. One conclusion which\ncould be drawn from these results is that resistance offers a way for these young people to heal\nthemselves and may also serve to increase their sense of well-being.\nHow safe do you feel?\nAn important question in the survey concerned young people's subjective feelings of safety in\ndifferent social settings. The contexts which we asked about were: the family; school; sporting events;\nsocial occasions and the streets. The family and school are generally regarded as places where young\npeople are owed the highest duty of care and should be afforded the highest levels of protection. The\nintroductory statement to the safety section of the questionnaire read:\nMost people have times when they worry about their physical and emotional safety. To feel\nsafe is to feel protected from harm, to feel comfortable, relaxed and happy.\nWith this statement in mind, young people were asked to rate their feelings of safety at various\nlocations where they spent their time. They answered on a five point scale from 'very safe' to 'very\nunsafe' but for the purposes of clarity these were collapsed into 'safe', 'OK' and 'unsafe'. Looking to the\nqualitative data for further explanations, we found that an OK response was generally a disclaimer\nfollowed by 'but' and did not necessarily mean that all was well. For this reason OK should not\nnecessarily be taken as a positive response.\nThe place where most young people felt unsafe was at sporting events (20%). This was followed by\nthe streets (15%), school (14%), social occasions (10%) and the family home (6%). Those who had\nbeen abused were less likely to feel safe at home and at school, a further indication of the far reaching\neffects of abuse.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 38\nFigure 8.

as many young people in the study who felt unsafe at school as\nthere were those who felt unsafe on the streets. Part of the reason for this was the belief that there was\nno protection available in the ostensibly regulated school environment. There was evidence that if\nassault or harassment occurred, procedures and practices would not be set in motion to ensure justice\nor to prevent such behaviour recurring. A number of students commented on the inconsistencies\nbetween their schools' dealings with racism and sexism as opposed to heterosexism. In many cases,\nlittle was seen to be done by school authorities to address the hostility that was directed at gay, lesbian\nor bisexual students. One student asked: âWhy isn't gay hatred educated against like racism in\nschools?'. There were also examples of school authorities handling situations with poor judgement and\ndiscretion:\nWhen I was in year 9 (13 years old) I was called to the Headmaster's office. I was accused of\ntouching members of my own sex at school. There had been complaints from girls. I was\nunaware of any such behaviour and was incredibly hurt and insulted that I had been accused of\nbeing a lesbian. At the time I was unaware of my own sexuality and incredibly offended at the\nsuggestion. Looking back, I now feel that this was incredibly insensitive of the teacher involved,\nand I feel that she should have been better educated on ways to deal with similar situations.\n(Laura, aged 21).\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 39\nThese young people could see the double standards in play in many of their schools and they could not\nunderstand why other students were given support and protection and they were not.\n_____________________________________________________________________\nChrissie wrote...\nMy school was closed when I was 15. The following year I enrolled in my nearest high school\nand the students were extremely homophobic. Talk of homosexuality was avoided in all\nclasses. Late in the year, my class went to see a performance that featured a close friend of\nmine who is a lesbian. Her appearance is very masculine and during class discussion, more\nwas said about her appearance than her performance. Some very nasty comments were flying\nand I stood up and stated that her appearance had nothing to do with her ability and that she\nwas a close friend who I loved. After that incident I was subject to many nasty comments. One\nday as I was walking home some younger students started shouting \"leso bitch\" at me. They\nthen began to hurl rocks at me.\nI made an appointment with the counsellor to file a report. After finally making a report I was\nasked to identify the offenders in a line up. The offenders were internally suspended for forty\nfive minutes. I was told that it was \"all they could do\" so I suggested that I arrange a\nhomophobia seminar. They refused my offer but could somehow justify the three Christian\nseminars that were conducted that year saying that \"the Christians sing, dance and entertain\".\nThen I approached a group of gay, lesbian and bisexual musos who agreed to do a show. My\nproposal was once again refused by the school. I signed out that day and never went back.

I do not have\nanal sex (give or receive) and found that after my first experience had a period of slutting\nabout, going down on many people (all of whom I had feelings for, it wasn't just anonymous\nencounters). I do the gay scene (clubs and pubs) but have never done or desired to do a beat\nor sauna.\nI was at an all boys private school which was horribly homophobic until year 11 but moved\nto a mixed school to do year 11 and 12. There, I was in a very caring and open minded\nenvironment, with a lot of other people in my situation both boys and girls (approx. 10% of\nstudents were not \"Strait\" ). So here it was easy to finally find myself and \"Come Out\" . I had\nno problems and all my friends were extremely supportive, as were the teachers who worked\nit out for themselves. The only problem that I really encountered here was that as my best\nfriend is openly gay, people thought that we were a couple, including my mother; which\nirritated me a bit because if I had a fight with him in class, some teachers thought that we\nwere having relationship problems.\nI have found that by making friends through other gay friends I have built up a supportive\nand very important \"queer family\" of people aged between 17 to 40. I have found that my\nolder friends have been able to provide invaluable information on relationships, sex and\noperating within the gay community...This family has also been the main reason for why I\nfeel good about myself and empowered by my sexuality.\nI hope to finish my psychology degree, and take on a role in politics, and help the gay\ncommunity, because while there have been vast improvements in the way we are perceived\nover the last 20 years, there is still a lot of ignorance (i.e. some people still associate\nhomosexuality with paedophilia and intolerance via the Church which I hope to clear up as a\nlot of it is misquoted) . However my main concern is to make improvements so that closeted\npeople can find the strength to come out and be their \"true\" self.\n(Rowan, aged 18)\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 41\n4. About Your Sexual Behaviour\nSince your research seems to be concerned with the health risks of being a homo, I will just\nadd that I pretty much always have safe sex, whether it be with man, woman or lamppost. The\nqueer crowd I hang out with are all pretty damn well informed about the risks involved with\nunprotected sex... (Nathan, aged 20)\nKey Findings\nâ¢ 73% of participants had had sex.\nâ¢ More young women had had sex with both males and females, and nearly one-third of same-sex\nattracted young women had had sex only with males in the past year.\nâ¢ Young women were more likely than young men to be same-sex attracted, yet only heterosexually\nactive, although a substantial number of young men were also heterosexually active.\nâ¢ About 50% of young men reported 'always' using protection during sex, regardless of the gender\nof their sexual partner.\nâ¢ Participants' reported use of condoms in heterosexual encounters was on a par with that of young\npeople in the general population.\nSexual experience\nIn order to find out about the sexual experiences of participants, we used the general term 'sex', to be\ninclusive of gay, lesbian and heterosexual sex. Specific questions about actual sexual practices were\nnot asked. The number of participants who had had sex (73%) was split equally between males and\nfemales and just over one-quarter of participants (27%) had never had sex. One-third of the sample\n(33%) had had sex with both sexes, nearly half (45%) reported they had had sex with guys only and\n22% reported they had had sex with girls only. Young men tended to be sexually active at an earlier\nage than young women. With respect to rural and urban participants, no differences were observed in\nterms of numbers who were sexually active.\nFifty-nine percent of the young men indicated that over the last 12 months they had had sex with\nmales only. This compares with 29% of young women who had had sex only with other females.\nTwenty-eight percent of young men had had sex with both sexes, compared with 39% of young\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 42\nwomen. Fourteen percent of young men were having sex with the opposite sex only, compared with\n32% of young women. Overall, young women were far more likely than young men to have had a\nperson of the opposite sex as a sexual partner in the last 12 months.\nFigure 9.

Thirteen young women and eight young men who were exclusively same-sex attracted said\nthey had only had sex with the opposite sex in the past year.\nYoung men were more likely than young women to be sexually active in accordance with their sexual\nattractions. Eighty-three percent of young men who were exclusively same-sex attracted were having\nsex with males only, whereas the comparable figure for young women was 62%. Nearly half of the\nyoung women (42%) who were attracted to both sexes were sexually active only with males, which\ncontrasts with under one-third of young men in this attraction category. Three-quarters (85%) of gay\nidentified males had engaged in male to male sex only in the past 12 months. Of the young women\nwho identified as lesbian, only two-thirds (60%) said they had had sex exclusively with girls in the\npast year.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 43\nGendered (s)explorations\nThe results outlined above reveal distinctively gendered patterns in terms of young people's sexual\nbehaviour, particularly with regard to young women's greater likelihood of participation in\nheterosexual sex. In their stories, more young women spoke of being able to hide their same-sex\nattractions while participating in publicly acknowledged heterosexual relationships. Several recalled\nhaving sex or relationships with guys because they could quite passively go along with it and therefore\nblend in with their heterosexual friends:\nI still felt the need to conform to what was accepted around me, and as a result I repressed my\nfeelings and dated guys. (Linda, aged 20)\nI never chose the guys, (I figured I wasn't interested in guys because I was \"sexually\nimmature\" ) the guys chose me and I just went along with it. (Jeanette, aged 21)\nJudging from the stories submitted, this option was not as available to the young men in this study,\nmany of whom spoke of being labelled 'poofters' very early on in their lives, for example, due to\nplayground interests not considered masculine enough and physical characteristics considered 'girly'.\nSuch an outward presentation of being 'gay' may close off possibilities for young men in\nexperimenting with a public heterosexuality, or as the case may be, hiding under its cloak, which goes\nsome (but by no means all) of the way towards explaining why young men are less likely to go along\nwith or explore heterosexual sex.\nWriters such as Troiden (1989) have also observed that same-sex attracted young men have more\nopportunities for sexual encounters in public and highly sexualised 'gay' contexts, whereas young\nwomen's homosexual exploration is more likely to be in the context of established friendships.\nBroadly speaking, research results confirmed this. In the first instance, young men were more likely to\ndiscuss opportunities for sexual encounters with other males, away from the prying eyes of school,\nfamily and their immediate peers:\nMy first sexual experience [with a guy] was when I was 14. I had been warned never to go\nnear the toilets at the park close to the railway station...At these toilets I'd meet an older guy,\n17-18, I guess, who gave me a head job. It was the most wonderful thing that ever happened to\nme. (Jim, aged 18)\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 44\nI joined a dating service which opened up the opportunity for meeting other guys on the line\nand initially, just having sex. (Joe, aged 17)\nYoung women (who were more likely to be at school than young men) tended to disclose relationships\nor tentative sexual encounters with those known to them from school or close friendship networks:\nWhen I was 15, I started my first lesbian relationship with my best friend. I had been attracted\nto her for some time and one night, I slept over at her house...(Mirella, aged 17)\nI first had homosexual feelings in year 8 ...[which] started to come back when I met my\nsignificant other. We were friends before anything else. I decided that I had to confront my\nhomosexuality and I told her how I felt. We are still together and as blissed out as\never...(Mandy, aged 16)\nDeclaring love for a best friend and wondering if she felt the same way was a recurrent theme for\nfemale participants. In one respect, therefore, it could be seen as less safe for young women to be\nacting on their same-sex attractions. Not only is there the risk of others in the school environment\nfinding out, there is the added concern of potentially destroying established and valued relationships.\nYoung women's same-sex behaviours may well be postponed until such a time as they can be explored\nmore safely, e.g. after completion of school or at university.\nUse of protection during sex\nIn order to better examine the use of protection from STDs during sex, young men and young women\nwere separated into groups according to the orientation of their sexual behaviour, i.e. those who had\nhad sex with the same sex only, those who had had sex with the opposite sex only and those who had\nhad sex with both sexes in the past twelve months.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 45\nFigure 10.

An additional 5% reported unprompted that they used condoms and lubricant,\nan encouraging finding.\nAs in previous studies, the younger group reported higher condom use (95%) than the older group\n(86%).

(Rowena, aged 20).\nKey Findings\nâ¢ Participants in this study were far more likely to be using illegal drugs than young people in the\ngeneral population.\nâ¢ 11% of participants stated they had injected drugs. Significantly more young women than young\nmen had injected, and young people from rural areas were more likely to have injected than young\npeople from metropolitan areas.\nâ¢ 14-18 year old injecting drug users (IDUs) reported higher levels of sharing of injecting\nequipment than the 19-21 year old group.\nâ¢ 30% of participants had used party drugs, such as speed, ecstasy and LSD (acid).\nâ¢ 62% had smoked marijuana, more of whom were young women.\nQuestions regarding frequency of usage of legal and illegal substances were asked in this section of\nthe survey. Studies conducted in the USA have indicated that gay, lesbian and bisexual young people\nare more likely to be using and/or abusing tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and injecting drugs than other\ngroups of young people (Sanford, 1989; Miller et al., 1994). Consistent with this research, the young\npeople participating in this study reported high levels of drug and alcohol use.\nAlcohol\nMore than half of the participants reported that they drank alcohol at least once a week. Twenty-three\npercent specified 'weekly', 26% 'weekends only', and five percent stated they were drinking on a daily\nbasis. Only five percent of the young people who responded to the survey stated they 'never' drank\nalcohol. There were no gender differences with respect to drinking patterns.\nParticipants in both age groups were equally likely to be drinking on a daily basis (5% of each group).\nHowever, 19-21 year olds were more likely to be drinking on a weekly basis (56%) than 14-18 year\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 50\nolds (44%) and the younger group were more likely than the older group to state they were drinking\ninfrequently, ('monthly', 'less than once a month', 'a few times yearly', or 'never').

Twenty-three percent of young women (compared with 19% of young men)\nwere smoking weekly or more. Forty-five percent of young men reported they 'never' used marijuana,\nwhereas the comparable figure for young women was 30%. There were no age differences with regard\nto use of marijuana, however, this finding was contrary to our expectation that the younger group\nwould be less likely to use than the older group.\nResults with regard to usage of marijuana were surprising given that comparable studies undertaken\nwith 14 to 18 year old teenagers in Victoria have found that males are twice as likely as females to be\nregular users of marijuana. Levels of use are also much lower in general for general population young\npeople, for example, less than six percent of males and two percent of females in one study (Patten et\nal., 1995) were found to be smoking more than weekly.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 51\nHow often?

The younger group were just as likely to\nhave injected as the older group and gender differences were significant. Fifteen percent of the young\nwomen had injected drugs, compared with 7% of the young men. Young people from rural areas were\nalso more likely to state they had injected drugs than young people from metropolitan areas. The\ncomparable figure with regard to injecting in a recent survey of Victorian teenagers was two percent\n(Lindsay et al, 1997), and elsewhere, between two and five percent nationally (Reilly and Homel,\n1987, cited in Lennings, 1996).\nMost of those who had injected drugs at some time in the past had not done so in the past six months\n(44%), with the next largest group stating they used 'once a month or less' (14%).

There were no gender differences with regard to\nsharing, however, 14-18 year olds were more likely to have shared equipment than 19-21 year olds.\nEighty-six percent of the older group said they had 'never' shared, compared with 56% of the younger\ngroup. The younger group were also more likely to have shared on numerous occasions, with nearly\none-third (32%) having shared at least twice or more, compared with 2% of the older group.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 53\nSharing Equipment 14-18 year olds\nn %\n19-21 year olds\nn %\nTotal\nn %\nOnce 1 2% 2 6% 3 4%\nTwice or more 14 33% 1 3% 15 19%\nUnsure 4 9% 2 5% 2 7%\nNever 24 56% 31 86% 55 70%\nn=79\nTable 8. Sharing of injecting equipment by age.\nSix percent of participants were heroin users, which indicates that 5% of IDUs were injecting other\nsubstances, e.g. speed. One third of heroin users were injecting 'daily' another third only 'a few times\nyearly', with the remaining third falling somewhere in between. Patterns of heroin use did not vary\nwith regard to age or gender.\nFor some explanation of these high levels of drug use, we turned to the qualitative data. There were\nyoung people like Joel ( no injecting in the last six months) who was enjoying his first taste of the\nOxford St. (heart of gay Sydney) 'scene'. For Joel, who described a supportive family and friendship\nnetwork, drug taking was more likely recreational and linked to club culture.\nHowever, further analysis of the data revealed that participants who had been physically or verbally\nabused were more likely to be using heroin, marijuana and party drugs than those who said they had\nnot been abused. There were several stories such as Wayne's (p.54). Wayne wrote about years of\nabuse, confusion about sexuality and general feelings of marginalisation. For this young man and\nothers like him, drugs were acknowledged as one way to alleviate much of the pain associated with\ncoming to terms with sexuality.\nOnly ten of the 84 IDUs submitted longer stories along with their questionnaires, and similarly, nine\nout of these ten stories were negative in tone. Alison told us:\nI feel very confused about my sexuality. I have thought that I am gay, but then I think about\nthe social stigma and I get scared. I am going through some very painful psychological\ncounselling at present, dealing with depression and social phobias as well as drug abuse...I\ncommend this survey, because I fear for the youth of today. It is such a painful and mixed up\nworld out there, and we need all the help we can get.

From about Year 7 I realised where my feeling\nlay, but being the eldest child in a working class suburb, those masculine stereotypes were\nforced onto me. Unfortunately I didn't cope too well, and began to withdraw through high\nschool. I tried to fit in, but by Year 8 it was no use and the comments \"he's gay\" were often\nassociated with me (although no one knew that I was, it was just assumed).\nThe fact that I didn't enjoy sport, but would rather play an instrument, and pursue other\ncreative interests gave them further ammunition, although as I became more involved with\nmusic I performed outside the school at various occasions, and this coupled with a high\nabsence rate from school meant that I wasn't there very often. Looking back, I remember\nalways feeling sick in the stomach each morning. My mum even took me to the doctors a few\ntimes for medication. Now I see how nervous I was about school.\nThe ultimate humiliation was in my final year of school when a few guys decided to declare\nmy sexuality to the world by spray painting the local shopping centre with my supposed\nsexual habits and the fact that I am gay. An instant hit with the student body who thought it\nwas \"funny\".\nIt has taken me two years since school finished to begin re-building my confidence. I am still\nquiet in most social situations and often got quite depressed to the point of contemplating\nsuicide (a result of my high drug use which I used, and still do as a way to escape my\nfeelings). I still question whether I am gay, even after all these years, I still can't accept it\nsome days. I am really confused, and the isolation compounds the feelings. Having to bottle\nall of my emotions and deal with them by myself has left me on the brink of emotional\ndestruction.\nI say to myself that life will get better, and I'm sure it will, but puberty and adolescence, are\nhard at the best of times for straight people - you only have to read a magazine or watch TV -\nwho have friends, relatives etc to talk their problems through with, but for a homosexual\nperson - who often has no one to talk to - these years can be hell on earth.\n(Wayne, aged 20)\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 55\n6. Disclosure and Support\nThe main reason that I still haven't come out to anyone even though I'm 19 is because I come\nfrom such a conservative ethnic family. My parents are Chinese and I don't think Australian\ncounsellors would really understand how difficult it is to be gay and come from an Asian\nbackground...I feel that coming out would not only hurt my parents, but because of the nature\nof our community, they would feel a great deal of shame as well. (Lee, aged 17)\nKey Findings\nâ¢ Over 80% of the group had disclosed their sexuality to at least one other person.\nâ¢ Although young people rarely sought support from professionals (doctors, youth workers, student\nwelfare co-ordinators, teachers, counsellors), when consulted these people were found to be, on\nthe whole, supportive.\nâ¢ Young people were slightly more likely to disclose to family members than professionals. Mothers\nand sisters were more likely to be chosen to confide in than dads and brothers.\nâ¢ Two-thirds of those who had spoken to mum found her supportive and half who had spoken to dad\nfound him supportive. Three-quarters of the young people who had told a sister found her\nsupportive and two-thirds who had spoken to a brother had found him supportive.\nâ¢ Young people were most likely to disclose to a female or male friend. Three- quarters found their\nfemale friends supportive, and two-thirds found their male friend's supportive.\nâ¢ Disclosure on its own did not lead to more positive feelings about sexuality. However, young\npeople who disclosed and received support did feel better about their sexuality.\nWe asked our participants about the people they had spoken to about their sexual attraction and, out of\nthese, who had given them support. We divided confidantes into three groups: professionals, including\nteachers; doctors and counsellors; friends and family. Eighty-two percent of the group had spoken to\nsomeone about their sexuality leaving almost one in five who had spoken to no one.\nThe decision to speak to someone about same-sex attractions was not taken lightly by participants in\nthis research. They were well aware that making the wrong choice of confidante could destroy their\nequilibrium and had the potential to make their lives at home and at school very difficult. In a number\nof cases, the negative consequences of disclosing to the wrong person were described. Loss of trust\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 56\nand a sense of shame and betrayal were common when close friends and others reacted badly. At the\nother extreme, support was often found where least expected.\nDisclosure to and support from professionals\nParticipants had rarely spoken to professionals about their sexuality, though the majority had found\nthis group to be supportive when approached. Only five percent had sought help from student welfare\nco-ordinators, 12% from youth workers, 14% from teachers, 11% from doctors and 24% from\ncounsellors outside the school system.\nSchool counsellors and welfare officers who are officially there for this type of support, and other\nadults in the school system generally had the reputation of not keeping a confidence. As one young\nman said:\nI couldn't turn to the school counsellor [student welfare co-ordinator] because I know that she\ntalks her \"cases\" over with other people. I have been told of other people's problems and once I\nknew that I found distrust in the school system. (Adam, aged 18)\nHowever, there were some examples given of school personnel who were extremely supportive and\ninstrumental in improving the quality of school life:\nThe most supportive person I have talked to is a teacher at school who is a lesbian. She was\nreally great. I went to her before my student welfare officer because the welfare lady is my best\nfriend's mum. It was rather complex.

Generally they were\nconcerned about bringing shame upon their families:\nI think the only reason Iâm not out is I donât want to disappoint my parents. When I was little,\nabout 6 or so, my Mum said âWeâll always be proud of you, even if you are homosexual :\nmaybe not as proud, but still proud.â (Jason, aged 16)\nMany also worried that they would be thrown out of home, and indeed this had become a reality for\nsome:\nA month before I was 16, I came out to my father and as a result I have moved out of home. I\nhave been supporting myself since and am currently continuing my education. (Mark, aged 17)\nConsistent with expressed fears about being thrown out, those who lived at home were less likely to\nhave told their family than those who lived independently, and mothers were more likely to be\napproached than fathers.

However, further analysis of the data revealed that those who had disclosed their sexuality\nto at least one person, and had also received a supportive response were significantly more likely to\nfeel better about their sexuality. There are clearly benefits for young people in being able to talk\nopenly about their lives, and come out to those around them, however the data suggest that this is only\nthe case if the confidante is supportive.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 60\nAmy wrote...\nI guess my family was really supportive when I told them I was bisexual. Maybe they did not\ncompletely understand, but they were there to support me when I needed it nonetheless. I\nhave found that the younger generation is more open and willing to accept things than people\nof say my parents age and older, but I guess that kind of goes without saying. It is pleasing to\nsee that more and more people are coming to terms with the fact that being gay is not a 'sin' or\nanything to be ashamed of. I know that a lot of gay people suffer from many problems due to\nharassment and abuse, perhaps I just grew up in a well educated home, school and general\nenvironment. When I was about 10 I had my first encounter with a girl, nothing overly\nsexual, just kissing, touching. Relationships with other girls after that steadily increased\nphysically and it was not until my first year of high school that I actually had my first\nboyfriend. Since then, I have had a string of both male and female partners.\nGuys don't always except the fact I like girls too. My current boyfriend is very understanding\nand we are very honest with each other. I think this strong relationship has helped me a lot to\nget a grip on things, with coming out and everything. I have a really close older male friend\nwho is bi and he has guided me towards making decisions for myself, regardless of other\npeople's views on being gay. He was one of the first people I told. It was only a few years ago\nthat I told my parents and midway through last year was when I decided it was time my\nfriends knew. Sure there was some negativity and abuse from certain people but I have a\npretty good bunch of friends. (I don't think I could have told them otherwise). I am now in my\nfinal year of high school and things are going well. I am glad so many people in my life have\nbeen supportive. I don't really have any hassles with talking about my sexuality.\n(Amy, aged 17)\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 61\n7. Sexuality Education\nThere was nothing visible at school or in my community to help. No pamphlets at school, no\nposters, no safe homosexual sex lessons. I felt alone. (Lisa, 17)\nKey Findings\nâ¢ Information about heterosexual relationships was easily accessed and readily available with most\nyoung people learning about this topic from family, media, friends and school.\nâ¢ Information about gay and lesbian relationships was far more difficult to access. Around half had\nreceived information about gay and lesbian relationships from the media and friends, one-tenth\nfrom the family and about 15% from school.\nâ¢ With regard to safe sex information, four out of five young people learned about heterosexual safe\nsex from school and the media, and about half from family and friends.\nâ¢ At school, there was little information about gay or lesbian safe sex and the situation was even\nworse in the context of the family.\nâ¢ Rural young people had more difficulty accessing information about gay and heterosexual safe\nsex, than young people from metropolitan areas.\nSources of information\nAn important aim of this research was to consider the accessibility of sexual health information. Past\nresearch has revealed that the family and the school are the two main providers of sexual health\ninformation for young people, who generally trust the information they gain from these sources.\nFriends and the media are also important sources but the level of trust that young people have in the\ninformation they gain is much lower (Rosenthal & Smith, 1995). We asked the participants in this\nstudy to nominate their sources of access to two sets of information: heterosexual, lesbian and gay\nrelationships; and heterosexual, lesbian and gay safe sex.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 62\nFigure 16.

Information about gay and lesbian\nrelationships was far more difficult to access. Around half had received information about gay and\nlesbian relationships from the media and friends, one-tenth from the family and about 15% from\nschool. Rural youth were significantly more disadvantaged than urban young people when it came to\nobtaining information on gay relationships from school.\nIn regard to safe sex information, four out of five young people learned about heterosexual safe sex\nfrom school and the media and about half from family and friends. However, young people from\nmetropolitan areas reported more access to heterosexual safe sex information from the media than\nrural young people. Access to homosexual safe sex information was rarely available from the trusted\nsources. At school, there was little information about gay or lesbian safe sex and this topic was\nneglected even more in the context of the family.\nYoung people from rural areas were again clearly more disadvantaged in this regard than their urban\npeers. Those from the country were significantly less likely to report access to information on gay safe\nsex from all of the available sources (school, media, family and friends) than young people from\nmetropolitan areas.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 63\nMany participants made comments about difficulties in getting the information they needed, whether\nit was for themselves or for their parents. One young man said of his local library: 'The gay section is\nabout half a shelf (no joke!!!), but it was enough for me to find four books to take home.' Many young\npeople were aware of the double standard: 'Information on heterosexual everything is so widely\npromoted and so little on homosexuals'.\nGiven the often sensational nature of information which comes from the media, including the\nstereotyping of the gay and lesbian character, and the pervasiveness of negative discourses around\nhomosexuality in youth culture, the information gained from media and friendship networks is less\nlikely to be useful. Same-sex attracted young people are have difficulty accessing the information they\nneed to protect and resource themselves by the two groups with the largest duty of care. They are for\nthe most part accessing information from the two groups whose information is most likely to be\nincorrect or misleading.\nFigure 17.

Over half of the group asked\nquestions (see Table 9) the content of which demonstrate a serious information deficit facing the\nyoung people participating in this study.\nIn all, 794 questions were asked and they ranged from concrete questions about sexual safety, to social\ninquiries about meeting people, to philosophical questions about the causes of sexuality. The most\nfrequently asked question (66% of young women) was about lesbian safe sex and it was clear from\nsome of the responses that this was the first time many young women had thought about it. Certainly\nlesbian sex has been almost entirely absent from safe sex literature and campaigns and when raised (as\nin the survey) young women began to think about it:\nThe only sex education I had in my whole life was a semester of health in year 10. It was far\ntoo late, and there was no mention of homosexuality. We spent several weeks on safe sex, but\nuntil I read your survey, I didn't know that two women could use protection. (Le, aged 16)\nTypical questions about lesbian safe sex were:\nIs it possible to get an STD or AIDS during unprotected lesbian sex. If so which STDs and are\nthey fatal?\nIf you are a lesbian can you catch STDs from uncleaned sex aids?\nWhat safe rules are there for women?\nA number of young people asked questions about safe sex in general such as:\nIs clingwrap safe to use as a safe sex tool?\nWill swallowing semen affect my stomach?\nHow do you protect against hepatitis during non-penetrative sex?\nExactly how safe is oral sex without a condom?\nBesides HIV what are the health dangers of anal sex?\nIs performing anal sex on a guy as high risk as taking it?\nMany young people asked homophobia-related questions which reflected the discrimination and abuse\nthat they had suffered:\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 65\nWhy are people so unkind?\nWhy isnât gay hatred educated against like racism in school?\nOthers wanted to know how to meet other people like themselves:\nHow can you approach someone who you are attracted to of the same sex?\nWhere do I meet guys?\nAnd yet others were interested in issues around sexual identity:\nAm I gay?\nAre most people inherently bisexual to some degree?\nAre many people confused if they are gay?\nIf you haven't known it all your life does that mean you're not really gay?\nQuestions asked about sexuality or safe sex Male\n%\nFemale\n%\nTotal\n%\nTotal\nn\nLesbian safe sex information 3% 66% 37% 157\nWhy homophobia? 27% 28% 27% 116\nGeneral sex information 21% 25% 23% 96\nWhat causes sexuality? 27% 15% 21% 88\nInformation on where to meet others 19% 15% 17% 70\nOral sex information (m-m) 28% 2% 14% 60\nGay safe sex information 27% 3% 14% 58\nIssues surrounding relationships 14% 10% 12% 51\nWhy no homosexual sex education in schools? 9% 11% 10% 41\nAm I really gay/ lesbian/ bisexual? 5% 11% 8% 35\nTelling parents; coming out. 7% 6% 7% 28\nMiscellaneous 8% 5% 6% 27\nHow many people are homosexual/ heterosexual? 6% 6% 6% 25\nLegal issues 8% 2% 5% 20\nWhat is gay/ lesbian sex? 4% 4% 4% 17\nAnal sex information 5% 1% 3% 12\nGay/ lesbian role models 3% 1% 2% 8\nGovernment funding of gay/ lesbian services 1% 1% 1% 5\nTable 9.

Good luck!\n<Date>\nDear Mum and Dad,\nYou're both probably wondering what this is all about, although you may already know. If I\nbuilt up the courage to tell you what I was supposed to when I handed you these envelopes,\nthen you'd both know that I am gay. That is something which is really hard for me to say to\nyou. This isn't something which happened overnight, I realised I might be gay back in 1990,\nwhen I was fourteen years old.\nI have never been attracted to females; don't get me wrong, females are great people, and great\nfriends, but unfortunately I don't feel I could even begin to have a relationship with one. I am\nautomatically attracted to my own sex. I simply didn't decide to like guys, it's something\nwhich just happened, it feels natural for me.\nFor you mum, when you grew up, you were automatically attracted to guys, so you met and\nfell in love with dad. And you dad, when you grew up, you were automatically attracted to\ngirls, so you met and fell in love with mum. You both didn't have to decide that you liked the\nopposite sex, it just happened to you naturally didn't it? Well it's exactly the same for me;\nwhen I was growing up, my feelings were telling me that I liked guys, not girls. It may sound\nstrange to you, but I don't have to even think about it, it feels so natural for me to like guys.\nSome straight people don't believe you can naturally love someone who is the same sex as\nyou, but I can tell you that it does happen, because it has happened to me.\nAccording to statistics, one tenth of the population is gay; that's a lot of gay people. It may not\nseem like there are many gay people around, but a lot of them are too afraid to come out in\nfear of being rejected by family, friends and society. I just happen to be part of that one tenth,\nand nobody can predict who will turn out gay.\nNow that you know, I hope you will still treat me the same way as you did before; as a normal\nperson. There is nothing wrong with me, it's just the way some people react when they hear\nsomeone is gay. Nobody is going to be able to change my mind and try to make me straight.\nSome gay people try to act straight and attempt a straight relationship, but most of the time it\nends up as a disaster, and can sometimes cause suicide. I love life, and I love the way I am, so\nI'm not going to change, and become depressed about who I should be. I am who I am.\nEverything I do will be exactly the same as it was before you knew I was gay, only I will be\nsharing my life with another guy, not a woman.\nI would like to thank you both for taking the time to read this letter, I know it must be hard for\nyou to find out your son is gay, and I hope you understand that coming out and telling you was\nan extremely difficult thing for me to do. I hope you will both be supportive about this issue,\nbut if you don't want to know me as your son, then I will be happy you know the truth, but sad\nthat you don't love me for who I really am. I will understand if you no longer want me to be a\npart of your lives but I hope we can still be as we are now; one happy family. Thank you, and\nplease remember, I love you both, always!\nLove from your son.\n(Nick, aged 21)\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 67\n8. Virtual Communities\nThe Internet was the way I found of being who I am...(Lydia, aged 17)\nRelationships, self-affirmation and safety\nA number of young people in this study wrote about their experiences of friendship and self-\naffirmation on the Internet. For many, this was the only place where they had had the opportunity to\ncommunicate with others in similar situations to themselves:\nI had met this great girl on the Net, who was 17 and gay, in the same country as me which\nwas even better. We started writing and that really helped a lot, now we've been writing for 6\nmonths. (Kate, aged 14)\nI have been using the Internet and chat rooms to help myself accept my homosexuality, there\nare people in the chat sites who are in my situation and I have many friendships with these\npeople. (Tom, aged 17)\nI've also made some gay friends via IRC (if you're gay and not using IRC you don't know\nwhat you're missing!!!) ... it was just the Internet and the people using it who made me realise\nthat I'm not alone, and gave me the chance to talk to people like myself. (Mark, aged 20)\nHugh Miller sees the Internet as a safe space for exploring presentations of self because âyou can put\nyourself up for interactions without being aware of a rebuffâ and âothers can try you out without\nrisking being involved further than they would wishâ (1995: 3). This lack of face-to-face relations\nprovides a safety net for young people exploring same-sex attraction that is simply not available to\nthem in âReal Lifeâ (RL). Claire, one of the participants, wrote:\nI've been open about my sexuality over the Internet since I was about 13, and I've mostly\nfound this to be a good idea it's mostly a supportive environment, and people who insult you\nfor your sexuality don't seem as threatening.\n(Claire, aged 14)\nIn this scenario, Claire acknowledges that the Internet is not always supportive but that the lack of\nface-to-face relations makes any insults directed at her less threatening than they would be in RL.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 68\nThe Internet as a rehearsal space for coming out\nA populist view of young peopleâs interactions with new information technologies is that they will\nuse Cyberspace as a retreat from the everyday world. Daniel Chandler, in an article which examines\nthe presentation of self via home pages cites an on-line interview with James, a gay British Internet\nuser, who told him that âhaving a home page meant that he was âoutâ in Cyberspace long before being\nout in daily life.â (Chandler, 1998:12). There are plenty of examples of young people ârehearsingâ\ncoming out scenarios in our data, which indicates that they are not using it as a retreat but as a safe\nway to experiment with coming out, in Turkleâs words âbuilding realities less limited than their ownâ\n(1996b). In the example on page 66, Nick created a link to his homepage where he had constructed a\nproforma for a coming out letter to parents.\nNick encourages others to adapt his letter to their own Real Life situations, and expresses the hope\nthat he can one day feel safe enough to actually give it to his mum and dad.\nThe Internet and face-to-face relations\nIt has been suggested that âsome people may feel \"more themselves\" on the Internet than they do in\nRL in an analogous way to that in which some people feel better able to express their thoughts,\nfeelings and personalities in writing than in face-to-face interaction (Chandler, 1998). However, what\nis missing in Virtual Reality (VR) are such things as âfacial expressions, vocal cues, body language -\nposture, gestures and non-verbal mannerisms in general - together with style of dress and hairstyleâ\n(Chandler, 1998: 4). Symbols such as :) and *grin* are often used to replace these cues but still\nremain poor substitutes. Young people have the ability to switch apparently seamlessly between VR\nand RL but the pull towards self-affirmation and acceptance by significant âembodiedâ others is\nstrong. Many of the participants expressed dissatisfaction with relations on the Internet as Daniel and\nChristen suggested when they wrote:\nPorn on the net is just so distant and is no substitute for the warmth of a loving boyfriend.\n(Daniel, aged 15)\nIâve been on the Internet and talked to other gays but I donât really feel comfortable because I\ncanât see them. (Kirsten, aged 16)\nIn the following examples participants used the Internet as a rehearsal for the ârealâ thing:\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 69\nThrough the Internet I have met people in the same situation as me. About 3 weeks ago I met\na girl (whom I had been communicating with via the Internet for a few months) in real life.\nShe is the first person I have had real contact with who knows about my sexuality, and it felt\nreally weird, maybe because she is bisexual too. (Jessica, aged 20)\nAfter looking around I found the #gayyouth channel. Within 3 or 4 nights (I started that bad\nhabit of logging on every night), I had made three friends. I met one of them (another\nAndrew! - it is said all Andrews are gay and I suspect it to be mostly true) in real life two\nweeks later - a truly nice guy and a really good friend. (Justin, aged 19)\nIn these examples young people are actually using their VR experiences to change things in RL.\nThis brief examination of the ways in which these young people use the Internet to explore their\nsexuality suggests that it provides them with one of the few safe spaces available, where they can\nforge relationships that affirm their sexuality.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 70\nRosa wrote...\nI am 20 now and have finally understood and accepted my attraction to other females. It has\nreally been the last four months that I have started living confidently as a lesbian. (It is so\nmuch easier to write it than to tell someone!) Before that I dodged the truth for my whole life.\nIt is funny that I can look back now and see that I was always gay and it has been destined for\nme for 20 years. I have books and books of ten years of diary writing (on and off again) and it\nis such a record of my sexuality. All the time I was unaware of this. Periods where I wrote\ndutifully every day were times when I had a beautifully funny teacher or a best friend I had to\nwrite about. My life is more steady now, so too is the diary writing.\nI went to an all girls school but only still have one true friend out of all of them. As my life\nstyle became more obvious they seemed suddenly busy and now I am rarely in contact with\nthem. Since school I have been travelling a lot and havenât been around the area much...I\nhave developed a new group of friends now which is great and what I needed.\nIt probably took me so long to realise because I had no reason to think I could have been gay.\nI had never had any exposure to gay people and no information had been available to me.\nSchool personal development was entirely directed at heterosexuals and I wasnât questioning\nthis. My attractions have always been towards other girls and socially I felt things werenât\nright but then if you didnât know anything else it is unlikely you can just develop. I began\ndeveloping my sexual being much later when I had met a dyke. This gave me something new,\nit opened up for me what I had never been.\nI love being a lesbian; the friendships having been built in an honest and trusting way and\nstrong and supportive. I finally feel that I know what I want, this I tell you is a huge relief.\nSuddenly everything became so clear for me. Before dealing with anyone else I have found I\nhave needed time to feel comfortable and confident. Once you have the confidence you can\ndeal with it all. The harassment and prejudice comes from small minded people we wouldnât\nwant anything to do with anyway. It can be scary at times and there are times when I feel\nvulnerable but I would never wish to be any different.

Many young people were experimenting with and exploring same-\nsex sexuality, while others have told stories (some for the first time) of clearly identifying as gay,\nlesbian or bisexual, sometimes in the absence of actual sexual experience. In the context of\nsupportive and affirming environments, which included some schools and families, and importantly,\nthe Internet, young people were able to share stories which celebrate and affirm sexual diversity. It\nwas encouraging to find that one-third felt unreservedly good about their sexuality, despite evidence\nof the extent to which all sexualities other than heterosexual remain stigmatised in Australian society.\nHowever, overall, this research points to the absence of wide-spread public affirmation for\nhomosexuality, as a practice or an identity, and many of the young people who contributed to this\nstudy were experiencing loneliness and isolation. Fear of being 'outed' and of 'coming out' to parents\nor friends were common themes and a considerable number of participants were experiencing overt\nabuse and discrimination in their daily lives. The decision to speak to someone about same-sex\nattractions was not taken lightly. Young people were well aware that making the wrong choice of\nconfidante could destroy their equilibrium and had the potential to make their lives at home and at\nschool very difficult. In a number of cases, the negative consequences of disclosing to the wrong\nperson, particularly in the context of the family and school were described. Loss of trust and a sense\nof shame and betrayal were also common when close friends reacted badly. At the other extreme,\nsupport was often found where least expected.\nThe school environment needs to come under particular scrutiny given that school was the site of\n70% of the homophobic abuse disclosed, making the school as unsafe as the streets for a number of\nparticipants (see Recommendations). It was disturbing to learn that in some cases, this abuse\nappeared to be occurring with the knowledge of those with a responsibility for duty of care to all\nstudents, namely teachers and other school authorities. Given this situation, the extent to which some\nparticipants had picked up on other discourses of resistance, for example, those against racism and\nsexism, is testimony to their resilience in the face of adversity. The young person who wrote: 'Why\nisn't gay hatred educated against like racism in school?' had clearly appropriated arguments against\nracism to use as arguments against heterosexism. Other young people also questioned a range of\ndiscriminatory practices which existed in schools such as the failure to honour basic human rights\nand the selective granting of privileges based on gender and sexuality.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 72\nDespite the fact that use of alcohol, marijuana and other illegal drugs is increasingly a feature of all\nyoung people's recreational lives, the high levels of usage of these substances reported by our\nparticipants needs to be emphasised. Stories young people told specifically linked drug use in part to\nalleviating painful feelings or experiences associated with their sexuality, and in some cases, to\nattempts at suicide. The levels of injecting drug use revealed by this group were up to four times\nhigher than results obtained from other Australian studies. This points to the need for more specific\nresearch, particularly with young women and rural young people, whose levels of injecting were\nsignificantly high.\nFinally, another key theme of the research was information deprivation. The range and sheer number\nof questions young people had about their homosexual feelings and behaviours emphasised the extent\nto which sexual exploration was occurring without much knowledge from trusted sources (school and\nfamily) as opposed to less trusted sources (media and peers). Information regarding lesbian sexuality\nand safe sex was a particular absence, and young people from rural areas were disadvantaged\ngenerally compared with their urban peers when it came to gay or 'straight' sexuality information\nfrom any source. Particularly in light of the evidence this research provides of extensive 'bisexual'\nactivity, it is very important that SSAY are resourced to make informed decisions about their safe sex\npractices. It is also crucial that all young people are provided with a supportive environment as they\ntry to make sense of diverse sexual feelings and behaviours.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 73\nRecommendations\nImplications of this research for schools\nPolicy\nâ¢ It is important to take a 'whole school' approach to the issues raised by this research. Sexuality is a\nstructuring force in the lives of all young people, and a framework is needed which supports\nsexual diversity in all aspects of school life, rather than relegating such issues solely to the Health\nor Welfare curricula. In particular, there needs to be an emphasis on providing a safe school\nculture, rather than a focus on trying to identify queer students. Everyone in the school\nenvironment, teachers and students, need to be part of this process.\nâ¢ Most schools already have anti-racism and anti-violence policies, in accordance with a duty of\ncare to all students. Consideration needs to be given to policy development in the related area of\nhomophobia, in terms of ensuring the unacceptably high levels of sexuality related abuse and\nharassment endemic in school environments are no longer tolerated.\nâ¢ Schools should embark on policy development with an awareness that the Equal Opportunity Act\n(1995) exists in order to support those discriminated against for being 'different'. Young people\nwho are maltreated within the school system have access to a supportive legal framework, should\nsuch support be denied them in the school environment.\nCurriculum\nâ¢ Clearly, there is a dearth of information available in schools with regard to sexual diversity,\nincluding an absence of basic knowledge about STD prevention for all but heterosexual sex.\nHowever, care needs to be taken that discussions of homosexuality are not exclusively (and\nmisleadingly) linked to disease prevention, i.e. discussion of HIV and STDs.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 74\nâ¢ Schools need to take initiative in providing a sex education curriculum which acknowledges\nsound research evidence of high levels of sexual experimentation and sexual diversity among\nyoung people. A responsible curriculum needs to be inclusive of all sexualities, in order to\nensure young people are not forced to seek information and support from the two sources they\ntrust least, the media and their friends.\nâ¢ This research has demonstrated that SSAY are heavily reliant on the media for information about\nqueer sexuality. Media representations of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people often\ndraw on a very limited range of negative and misleading stereotypes. There is much scope to\ninterrogate these media representations, in the context of sexually diverse curricula.\nImplications of this research for all practitioners working with SSAY.\nSexual and cultural diversity\nSame-sex attracted young people are not an homogenous group. This research has revealed that some\nyoung people exploring their sexuality will do so relatively unproblematically, whereas others will\nrequire intensive support. Some young people will clearly identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, whereas\nothers will experience homosexual behaviours and attractions as having little meaning for future\nidentity. A number of SSAY will be labelled as gay or lesbian by their peers, while others will remain\ninvisible.\nFurther to the above, living a queer lifestyle is not a concept which translates easily across a number\nof non-Western cultural boundaries. SSAY from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Backgrounds\n(CALDB) may need specific support related to this issue. It is important for practitioners to take a\nnon-judgemental approach to sexuality, and to be wary of making assumptions.\nYoung people from rural areas\nThis research also indicated that SSAY from rural areas were experiencing a greater sense of\nisolation and lack of access to information than their urban peers. It should also be noted that rural\nyoung people were more likely than those from metropolitan areas to have injected drugs and also\nmore likely to state that they 'never' used condoms in gay or heterosexual sex. The support needs of\nthis group should be considered carefully, both at the local level and in the context of State and\nNation-wide information campaigns.\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 75\nThe importance of options\nEncouraging SSAY to 'come out' is not necessarily the solution. This research has demonstrated that\ndisclosure of sexuality only increases young people's well-being if the people they choose to come\nout to are supportive. Sixty-five percent of the young people participating in this research were living\nin the family home, many with a fear of violence or of becoming homeless should their sexuality be\ndisclosed. Young people's fears need to be taken seriously, indeed for some participants, the fear of\nhomelessness had become a reality.\nFor this reason, encouraging young people to disclose their sexuality to family members, particularly\nwhile they are in a position of financial dependence is to be viewed with caution. What is important\nis providing a range a options: e.g. access to gay, lesbian, bisexual adult role models; linkages to\nyouth peer support groups and the opportunity to discuss sexuality in private and in confidence with a\nsympathetic and informed adult.\nWriting Themselves In\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 76\nNational Report on Same-Sex Attracted Young People\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage 77\nReferences\nBagley, C. & Tremblay, P. 1997, 'Suicidal behaviours in homosexual and bisexual males', Crisis: the\njournal of crisis intervention and suicide prevention, Vol. 18, No. 1, pp. 24-34.\nBartos M., McLeod J. & Nott, P. 1993, Meanings of sex between men, Australian Government\nPublishing Service, Canberra.\nBrown, G. 1996, Sexuality issues and risk taking behaviour amongst WA gay and bisexual male\nyouth, Post graduate research study, School of Health Promotion, Curtin University of Technology.\nCass, V. 1979, 'Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model', Journal of homosexuality, No. 4,\npp. 219-235.\nChandler, D. 1998, Writing oneself in Cyberspace, http://www.aber.ac. uk/~dgc/ homepgid.html,\nJune 12, pp. 1-17.\nCranston, K. 1992, 'HIV education for gay, lesbian and bisexual youth: personal risk, personal power\nand the community of conscience', in Harbeck, K.

    "abstract": "This 1998 report is about young people who are attracted to their own sex. The need for accurate baseline figures about young people of non-heterosexual orientation has developed as part of a general concern about the spread of the HIV virus into the adolescent population and a specific concern around these young peopleâs emotional well-being. In the past three years, Australian adolescent research conducted by the National Centre in HIV Social Research, La Trobe University, has revealed that a significant minority of young people are not unequivocally heterosexual, with numbers ranging between 8 and 11% in recent research.\n\nResearch which specifically targets this population has, until now, been conducted retrospectively and/or with people who identify as gay or lesbian recruited through gay and lesbian youth groups or the gay press. As researchers we know little about young people at pre-identity or pre-disclosure stages because their need for anonymity means they cannot be contacted through the usual channels.\n\nThe young people represented in this project were accessed through an advertising campaign in National magazines, via radio and the Internet. A survey was available on a website and from the Centre for the Study of Sexually Transmissible Diseases. Surveys were also inserted in the gay and street press.\n\nThese surveys sought information regarding sexual feelings and experiences as well as sexual and drug-taking practices in regard to STDs (including HIV) and related diseases. The source and adequacy of sexual health information for this group and their levels of support and experiences of abuse and discrimination were also elicited. The survey also charted young peopleâs perceptions of their quality of life and emotional well-being. In addition, participants were also asked to write stories about their experiences, including when they first knew about their sexual feelings, their relationships with family and friends, and their hopes for the future.\n&nbsp",
