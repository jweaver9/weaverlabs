The MSVSA, developed by the U.S. Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, guides states on the most efficientlaws and procedures related to maintaining accurate birth, death, and othervital records at the state, local, and territorial level. At the time when thegovernment promulgated the MSVSA provision related to gender correc-tions, it served as a forward-thinking model because it acknowledged thatvital records should be corrected in the case of individuals who change theirgender. Specifically, the 1977 MSVSA recommended that corrections togender markers on birth certificates be granted after applicants change their376 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESsex by \"surgical procedure\" and provide a court order to that effect.' Addi-tionally, the MSVSA recommended that the correction be kept private.2Over the past three decades, transgender legal rights have advancedand understanding of transgender medicine has evolved. Experts in trans-gender law and medicine entirely reject the idea that recognition of a per-son's gender should come only after surgery. This notion has also beensignificantly eroded in law and policy. Yet, with the exception of new lawsand/or policies in three states,3 birth certificate statutes and policies have yetto be modernized in this respect.Other scholars have examined the harms to transgender people causedby medically out-of-date policies related to updating gender markers onidentity documents and have suggested general frameworks for updatingthese policies.4 This Article focuses more specifically on birth certificates byproviding a detailed analysis of the rules overning a change in gendermarkers for all United States jurisdictions that issue them. It also presentspolicymakers with model statutory and policy language and is the first toresolve this issue within the framework of good government practices inaddition to transgender rights.This Article explains why and how state, local, and territorial birthcertificate laws and regulations ought to be revised based on changes in lawand medicine. In addition, the Article discusses public policy factors thatgovernments should consider when modernizing their policies, includingthe cost of various policies and the policies' legal and practical effects on thelives of transgender people.After providing important background information about gendertransition and the state of the law in Section I, the Article discusses threeaspects of birth certificate laws and policies. In Section II, it examines thestandard of proof-the evidence a person must demonstrate to be eligiblefor the correction. In Section III, the Article considers the procedure bywhich the correction is authorized-primarily whether an individual must1.

In Section IV, the Article analyzes pri-vacy protections, or their lack thereof, that exist in these policies.In each of these sections, the Article documents the state of the law,presents issues to consider when designing a new policy, including constitu-tional considerations, and provides detailed recommendations for a mod-ernized statute. The Article reviews the relevant MSVSA provisions,provides an overview of birth certificate laws in the fifty-seven state, local,and territorial jurisdictions' that administer birth certificates, and examinesin greater detail the laws of states which have policies that might serve asmodels. Where relevant, the Article also describes the 2010 policy regardingfederal birth certificate equivalents (known as \"Consular Reports of BirthAbroad\") for U.S. citizens born outside of the country, as well as the ap-proaches taken by the United Kingdom and Argentina.Ultimately, in Section V, the Article delineates a model statute for the21st century, recommending statutory language to be used by state, local,and territorial legislatures, vital statistics agencies, and the U.S. Departmentof Health and Human Services in future revisions of the MSVSA. 6 Adop-tion of the language presented here will ensure implementation of a vitalstatistics system that meets four goals: (1) issuance of accurate birth certifi-cates in accordance with contemporary medical standards, (2) efficient useof government resources, 3) respect for constitutional rights, and (4) properconsideration of both the human and legal effect of an accurate birth certifi-5. The fifty-seven jurisdictions are the fifty states, Guam, Puerto Rico, United StatesVirgin Islands, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,New York City, and the District of Columbia. See infa app. A.6. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is currently revising the ModelState Vital Statistics Act. See Ctrs. For Disease Control & Prevention, 2011 - ModelLaw Revision, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/modellawrevision.htm (last updatedNov. 10, 2009). I am indebted to my colleagues Mara Keisling and Harper JeanTobin of the National Center for Transgender Equality, Masen Davis and KristinaWertz of the Transgender Law Center, Dean Spade of the Sylvia Rivera Law Project,Dru Levasseur of Lambda Legal, Shannon Minter of the National Center for LesbianRights, and Jennifer Levi and Janson Wu of the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & De-fenders with whom I have discussed and debated extensively the best legislation andpolicy in this arena. My recommendations are sharper because of their insight. Fur-thermore, our organizations were, in 2009, able to make a collective recommenda-tion to the Model State Vital Statistics Working Group of the National Center forHealth Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as it con-siders revisions to the MSVSA. See Harper Jean Tobin, Nat'l Ctr. Transgender Equal-ity, Comments of Legal and Public Policy Organizations on Corrected BirthCertificates for Transgender People (Sept. 8, 2009) (on file with author). The recom-mended legislation in this Article deviates from that collective recommendation insome important respects and should not be taken as the recommendation of mycolleagues.[Vol. 19:373378MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTEScate. In certain states, this recommended statutory language could beadopted as regulations or written policy to the same positive effect.While the changes discussed in this Article to vital statistics laws andpolicies can seem technical in nature, the effect of not having governmentdocumentation that matches one's gender identity is tremendous. Althoughfor many, lack of accurate documentation may trigger smaller problemscaused by undesired disclosure of their transgender status, for others, thelack of government documentation can have dire effects. Policies that pro-vide transgender people with identity documents that match their genderidentity give them a better chance to live life in their gender, and avoid bias,discrimination, and violence in the areas most critical to quality of life, suchas employment, housing, and education.Finally, there is another benefit-to governments and to transgenderpeople-that may result from modernizing birth certificate statutes and pol-icies. Currently, courts struggle to determine the appropriate assessment oflegal gender, and often settle on finding physical attributes or presumedgenetic traits of the body to be determinative.7 Transgender rights litigators,aware that relying upon bodily attributes to define legal gender leaves a largemajority of transgender people without recognition, often with disastrousconsequences, instead point to gender identity-a person's innate sense ofthemselves as male or female-as the relevant legal determinant.8 If birthcertificate laws and policies were reformed in the manner described in thisArticle, both courts and litigators could find a mutually satisfactory pathforward. Courts would be able to defer to a person's official gender markeron his or her birth certificate, and transgender rights litigators would besatisfied because the ability to change the gender marker on one's certificatewould be accessible to all transgender people who undergo gendertransition.1.

The Model State Vital Statistics Act (MSVSA)The first Model State Vital Statistics Act9 was issued in 1907 by theUnited States Census Bureau.' 0 The stated purpose of having an MSVSA isto \"promote uniformity among States in definitions, registration practices,disclosure and issuance procedures, and in many other functions that com-prise a State system of vital statistics.\"'ISince its inception, the MSVSA has been updated only five times,with the most recent version being released in 1992. The 1977 version ofthe MSVSA was the first to address corrections to gender markers. The1992 revision did not alter the language regarding gender markers; thus,today, the MSVSA reflects the best thinking of 1977 on gender corrections.It is quite remarkable that the MSVSA included language regarding thesecorrections in 1977, as transgender people had only been in national publicconsciousness beginning in the 1950s.12The MSVSA is currently under review for additional revisions, amulti-year process that started in 2009 and was expected to conclude in2011, although it has not yet been completed.'1 Organizations engaging in9.

Current U.S. State Law and Policies OverviewIn addition to the fifty states, birth certificates are issued by the Dis-trict of Columbia, New York City, American Samoa, the Commonwealth ofthe Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United StatesVirgin Islands.Twenty-nine of these fifty-seven jurisdictions5 explicitly allow for gen-der corrections on birth certificates in their statutory codes, potentially withaccompanying policies or regulations to implement the statute. Nine morejurisdictions 6 deal with gender corrections only in their regulations whiletwo have written, sub-regulatory policies.17 Ten operate without a writtenpolicy, or at least not one available to the public, but will correct the birthcertificate upon court order or doctor's affidavit, generally using the sameprocedure for other corrections.18In total, forty-six states, the District of Columbia, New York City,Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands clearly allow people to correct theirgender marker.'1 Oklahoma, Texas, and American Samoa do not have clearpolicies on whether or not changes are actually allowed. Tennessee has theonly explicit statutory ban on correcting gender markers; 20 for various rea-sons, Idaho, Ohio, and Puerto Rico also do not allow individuals to correctgender. Ohio does not correct gender markers as a result of a trial courtdecision that interpreted its ambiguous statute regarding birth certificate14. Tobin, supra note 6.15. The twenty-nine jurisdictions are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mas-sachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mex-ico, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, the District ofColumbia, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.

The poli-21. In re Ladrach, 513 N.E.2d 828 (Ohio Prob. Ct. 1987) (finding the statute onlyauthorized corrections if there was an error at the time of birth, thus only permittinga probate court to correct a fact that was inaccurate at the time of birth in the court'sview). However, since the case was decided, the stature related to corrections (nowalso called amendments) has changed. The current provision is now titled \"Amendedrecords\" (changed from \"[c]orrection of birth record\") and refers to corrections andamendments, whereas the old statute referred only to facts that have \"not been prop-erly and accurately recorded.\" Compare OHIO REV. CODE ANN. § 3705.20 (Lexis-Nexis 1980) with OHIO REV. CODE ANN. § 3705.22 (West 2011). Therefore, thereis a textual argument that the new text is not as limiting, and that the measure ofaccurateness could be taken as a contemporary measure, as opposed to one con-nected to a person's time of birth.22. The Idaho statute provides that \"alterations\" may be made to birth records in accor-dance with the statute or rules promulgated by the State Board of Health and Wel-fare. See IDAHO CODE ANN. § 39-250 (West 2010). Lambda Legal indicates thatthere is anecdotal evidence that the agency does not allow gender changes on birthcertificates. Sources of Authority to Amend Sex Designation on Birth Certificates,LAMBDA LEGAL, http://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/sources-of-authority-to-amend (last updated Oct. 3, 2012). Idaho's statute also notes that an amendmentdenied by the Registrar may be appealed to a court of law. See IDAHO CODE ANN.§ 39-250(5) (West 2010). However, there is no published case law of a person at-tempting to appeal a denial to a court; thus, there could be an opening for an indi-vidual to achieve gender change through a court appeal.23.

New Policy on Consular Reports of Birth Abroad and PassportsThe U.S. Department of State, in June of 2010, updated its policywith regard to Consular Reports of Birth Abroad of U.S. Citizens (CRBAs)and passports.28 CRBAs are provided to U.S. citizens who were born outsidethe U.S., where the fifty-seven birth certificate issuing agencies do not havejurisdiction. CRBAs are functionally equivalent to birth certificates forthose born in the United States; they prove citizenship, identity, and otherinformation about the person's circumstances of birth.Since at least 1992, the Department of State has required proof of \"sexreassignment surgery\" to correct gender on passports, and the same policywas presumably applied to CRBAs. 29 In an effort to modernize its policy inaccord with medical standards, the Department of State adopted a new pol-icy simply requiring that an applicant's treating or evaluating physicianwrite a letter certifying that a person \"has had appropriate clinical treatmentfor gender transition to the new gender.\"3028.

I have not located anold policy that specifically applies to CRBAs. It is also possible that: (1) gendercorrections on CRBAs were denied entirely, (2) gender corrections were processedunder an old policy that is not publicly available, or (3) gender corrections wereprocessed utilizing no written policy and therefore were not standardized. Regardless,because the Passport Vital Records section processes the corrections, the standard ofproof for CRBAs was likely the same as that for passports.30.

The U.K. Approach: The Gender Recognition Act of 2004The United Kingdom enacted a groundbreaking statute in 2004 whenit passed the Gender Recognition Act. This statute is understood as the firstnational statute to recognize the gender of transgender people who transi-tion without surgical procedures. Other countries have considered oradopted similar approaches, some being more or less restrictive.3 1The Gender Recognition Act, passed in response to the 2002 decisionin Goodwin v. United Kingdom, required the government to develop a sys-tem to recognize the post-transition gender of transgender people, findingthat failure to provide such recognition was a human rights violation.32The Gender Recognition Act does not require any specific medicaltreatment; however, it requires: (1) a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria,\"> (2)31. The United Kingdom law is included here because it is the basis for many of theother laws, and full texts of other laws, other than Argentina's, are not available inEnglish.

An Overview of Gender Transition and its Relation toCorrections on Birth CertificatesA short review of terminology related to transgender people and gen-der transition is helpful before going any further.Transgender is used generally as a broad term to refer to all of thosewhose gender identity41 or expression 42 does not match the social attributesof the gender that they were assigned at birth.4  While the term \"trans-gender\" is used appropriately to refer to a range of people, includingtranssexuals, cross-dressers, genderqueers, the androgynous, and many otheridentities, this Article only addresses one specific type of transgender per-39. Id. at Art. 4.40. While Argentina's new law should be considered for the basis of the recommenda-tions made in this Article, I have chosen to factor in the political landscape of thiscountry in shaping the more conservative recommendations found herein.41. Gender identity is used to mean an individual's internal sense of being male, female,or another gender.42. Gender expression is used to mean how individuals outwardly indicate their genderidentity to others, often through behavior, clothing, hairstyle, voice or bodycharacteristics.43. National Center for Transgender Equality, Transgender Terminology (May 2009),http://transequality.org/Resources/NCTETransTerminology.pdf.386 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESson-those who undergo gender transition to live their life as a gender dif-ferent from their sex4 1 assigned at birth.4 5Gender transition is the process of beginning to live and outwardlyexpress a gender different from one's assigned gender at birth.4 6 Gendertransition is not undertaken casually, as it is often accompanied by a widerange of negative social consequences, including rejection by friends or fam-ily, losing one's job, or even being physically attacked. Gender transition is44. Throughout this article, the terms sex and gender are used interchangeably, with atendency for sex to be used in contexts where a statute uses that term, and \"gender\"to be used otherwise. Some believe that the two terms have different meanings andshould be used accordingly. What Do We Mean by \"Sex\" and \"Gender'?, WORLDHEALTH ORGANIZATION, http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/ (last visitedDec. 25, 2011). In that conception, sex refers to one's biological status and genderrefers to the social identity and expression of being male and/or female. Id. However,the Supreme Court uses both terms in its jurisprudence relating to women's consti-tutional rights and Congress also has used both sex and gender in different civil rightsstatutes, while not intending a different meaning. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,490 U.S. 228 (1989) (collapsing the distinction between biological status and socialexpectations for the purposes of Title VII analysis); Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d1187 (9th Cir. 2000) (using the framework of sex under Title VII to gender underthe Gender Motivated Violence Act). This Article uses the terms interchangeablybecause interpreting them in a legal context to mean separate things would lead toabsurd results. Furthermore, the conception of sex being biologically based tends toimply, incorrectly, that the biology of sex is clear cut and easy to measure, when infact, much more diversity exists. See Erwin K. Koranyi, Transsexuality Revisited, 16AUSTRL. J. OF FORENSIC Sci. 34, 37 (1983) available at http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00 4 506183094 106 78 (\"Sex of a person-a simple 'yes' or'no' before-was broken down by Science to chromosomal sex, nuclear sex, hormo-nal sex, gonadal sex, and gender sex- to the dismay of courts, finding scientists inargument over as 'simple' a question as whether the subject is male or female.\").45. This subset of the transgender community are sometimes called transsexuals to distin-guish them from others covered by the broad term transgender. However, manytranssexual people, as well as advocates for equality, disfavor the term transsexual asoverly medical, scientific, and technical, or because the word's integration of theterm sex could be taken to sexualize the person. In addition, transsexual is often usedby those who oppose equal rights as an inflammatory and disrespectful term. See,e.g., 'Speedhless'awais Marcbpremiere, Am. FAMILY Ass'N J., Feb. 2008, http://www.afajournal.org/0208afa insp.asp (referring to homosexuals and transsexuals with re-gard to federal legislation); Transgendered Confu-; Homosexual movement takes US.into bizarre world, AM. FAMILY Ass'N, Oct. 2000, http://www.afajournal.org/2000/102000AFAJ.pdf (using the term transsexual repeatedly to refer to transgender peo-ple). This phenomenon is similar to how many gay and lesbian people prefer theseidentity terms over the more scientific and sexualizing term \"homosexual.\" GLAAD,MEDIA REFERENCE GUIDE 6, 8 (8th ed. 2010) (noting that many transgender peo-ple prefer \"transgender\" to \"transsexual\"). In respect for the generally favored termi-nology preferences of the community, this article uses the term \"transgender\"throughout, unless describing case law that uses other terminology.46. Gender transition may happen, or appear to happen, over a short period of time or along period of time, depending on the individual.2013]1 387MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWoften mistaken as referring only to the process of altering one's hormonalmakeup and other bodily characteristics to match one's gender identity.However, gender transition actually refers primarily to the social process oftransition, and includes the process of changing one's name (if needed ordesired), updating identity documents and records (if able to do so), inaddition to taking medical steps, depending on the individual.The medical processes, for those who undergo them, are incrediblyimportant. The American Medical Association has recognized that treat-ment is effective and medically necessary and has recommended that publicand private health insurance systems cover care related to gender transi-tion.4 7 According to the expert medical consensus, 48 treatment can consistof four therapeutic options: 1) changes in gender expression or role, 2) hor-mone therapy, 3) various surgeries,49 and 4) psychotherapy.5o Whether aperson should undergo all four or just one of the options is determinedbased on the needs of the individual. It is important to realize that thosewho undergo only changes in their gender expression or role (the first op-tion) are still considered to have made a medical transition.5 1Name and gender are the two pieces of information that transgenderpeople typically seek to correct on their birth certificates. Although the pro-cess and accessibility of name changes are not going to be addressed by thisArticle,52 the Article will address the privacy concerns regarding name47. Am. MED. Ass'N HOUSE OF DELEGATES, RESOLUTION 122 (2008).48. See WORLD PROF'L AsS'N FOR TRANSGENDER HEALTH, supra note 33; infra SectionII.B.1.49. Despite the popular conception of one surgery that completely transforms a person'sgender, in reality, there are many different surgical options. For example, breast orchest surgery, metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoptasty,clitoroplasty, vulvoplasty, hysterectomy/ovariectomy, facial feminization surgery,voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implanta-tion of erection and/or testicular prostheses are some of the primary surgical options,although others exist. See WORLD PROF'L Ass'N FOR TRANSGENDER HEALTH, Supranote 33, at 57-58, 62-64.50. Psychotherapy may be important for: \"exploring gender identity, role, and expres-sion; addressing the negative impact of gender dysphoria and stigma on mentalhealth; alleviating internalized transphobia; enhancing social and peer support; im-proving body image; or promoting resilience.\" Id. at 10.51. The medical seriousness of changing gender role is apparent throughout theWPATH Standards of Care. For example, changes in gender role are supposed to berecorded in a person's medical chart and changes in gender role are required for 12months before genital surgeries. Id. at 61.52. To receive a name change, one typically has to receive a court order and go through apublication process, although sometimes courts allow the publication requirement tobe waived due to privacy concerns. See, e.g., TRANSGENDER LAW CENTER, IDPLEASE. . . 9-22, 31-32 (2010) available at http://transgenderlawcenter.org/issues/id/id-please.388 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESchanges related to gender transition. Importantly, not all transgender peoplechoose to change their names. Some may have a gender-neutral name andkeep it, or may initially keep it and decide to change it later. Others maychoose to keep what others consider a gender-specific\" name for personalreasons, despite the fact that it does not \"match\" their gender identity. Re-gardless, not all transgender people change their name and name changeswill not necessarily occur before or simultaneously with the request to cor-rect their gender marker.C Data on the Ability to Correct Gender Markers on Birth CertificatesIn order to understand the impact of birth certificate laws and poli-cies, newly available data describing the ability of transgender people tocorrect gender on their birth certificates in the United States should be ex-amined. Specifically, reporting on only those individuals who are alreadyliving full-time as a gender different from the gender that they were assignedat birth, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey54 found:* 24% were able to correct the gender marker on their birthcertificates;* 18% were denied the correction, and;* 53% had not attempted to correct their birth certificate.\"Many of the 53% who did not attempt to correct their birth certifi-cates likely chose not to try because they knew they would not meet therequirements of the established policies; for example, they may not have hada required surgery. The data appear to confirm this, with higher rates ofattempting to change one's gender marker among those who have hadsurgery:53. Gender associations of first names are somewhat arbitrary and have a tendency tochange over time. See, e.g., Stanley Lieberson, Susan Dumais & Shyon Baumann,The Instability of Androgynous Names: The Symbolic Maintenance of Gender Bounda-ries, 105 Am. J. Soc. 1249 (2000) (describing 80 years of naming practices in Ohioand noting how names changed with regard to being considered feminine ormasculine).54. The National Transgender Discrimination Survey, conducted in 2008-09 both inpaper and online, had 6,456 respondents from all fifty states, D.C., the U.S. VirginIslands, Puerto Rico, and Guam.

The Importance of an Accurate Birth Certificate1. Purpose of a Birth CertificateAccording to the Office of Inspector General at the Department ofHealth and Human Services, birth certificates provide \"vital informationabout the person whose name appears on the certificate (e.g., legal proof ofparentage, citizenship, date, place, and time of birth).\"67 While originallyintended as a record of the existence and circumstances of birth, the birthcertificate is now used widely in determining eligibility for enpiloyment,obtaining other documents (e.g., driver's licenses, Social Security cards,passports, and other state identification documents), establishing schoolrecords, proving age, and enrolling in government programs.68 Thus, thebirth certificate is currently used as an identity document 69 and has evolvedaway from being a simple historical or statistical record.2. Legal and Practical Implications of an Inaccurate Gender DesignationThere are many practical, legal, and social realities that result fromhaving an inaccurate gender marker, some of them with potentially fatalconsequences. Although the gender recorded on a person's birth certificatemay not be considered legally binding,7o in many circumstances, it is anlow numbers of transgender men who have had these surgeries in the survey sample.Id.66. See infra note 114 and accompanying text.67. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GEN., U.S. DEP'T OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OEI-07-99-00570, BIRTH CERTIFICATE FRAUD at 2 (2000), available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-07-99-00570.pdf.68. \"[Birth certificates] are also used extensively for employment purposes, to obtainbenefits or other documents (e.g., driver's licenses, Social Security cards, and pass-ports), to assist in determining eligibility for public assistance and other benefits, toenroll children in school, and as proof of age eligibility for sports and other agerestricted activities.\" Id. at 6.69. Federal experts caution that a birth certificate should not be used alone as an identitydocument because it is impossible be sure that the holder of the certificate is theperson appearing before the agency. See id. at 20.70. Because of this, some have pursued gender change orders that declare a person's legalgender (unrelated to birth certificate corrections). Interview with Janson Wu, StaffAttorney, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (confirmed Feb. 11, 2012). Gen-der change orders can be particularly helpful for people who are at higher risk of2013] 391MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWimportant factor in determining whether or how an individual's gender isrecognized as a practical matter. In addition, transgender people holdingbirth certificates that are not corrected following gender transition risk hav-ing their transgender histories revealed, which can lead to a number of seri-ous harms. This is not an abstract issue; inspection of one's birth certificate(or documents it generates) can lead directly to discrimination and evenviolence, especially when a situation involves interactions with security of-ficers, employment, or access to sex-segregated facilities. The following sub-sections describe areas in which an incorrect gender designation and one'stransgender status, as revealed by the gender on one's birth certificate, canbe especially consequential in the United States, either because of the mean-ing attached to the gender designation, or because the disclosure of one'stransgender status may lead to harm.a. Initial Gender Designation on Governmental Identity Documentsand Those Governmental and Non-GovernmentalDocuments Derived TherefromBirth certificates establish the initial gender designation for other gov-ernmental identity documents, such as driver's licenses, passports and SocialSecurity records.71 The birth certificate, as well as these other governmentdocuments, in turn breed72 many other identity documents, such as schoolrecords, college ID cards, work identification, and commercial licenses.having their gender challenged by interested third parties, such as parents or childrenwho would gain a right to inherit if their transgender relative's marriage is heldinvalid.71. Although generally not written formally in policy, a person's initial gender on adriver's license/state ID will match that on one's birth certificate. Although it is lesscommon, at least two state Departments of Motor Vehicles require a corrected gen-der on one's birth certificate before updating the gender on one's driver's license(Montana and Kentucky). See Driver's License Policy by State, NAT'L CTR. FORTRANSGENDER EQUAL., http://transequality.org/Resources/DL/DL-policies.html(last visited Sept. 20, 2012). Similarly, to establish a person's initial gender on apassport, the birth certificate gender (or gender on other citizenship/identity evi-dence) is generally used. See 7 DEPT. OF STATE FOREIGN AFF. MANUAL 1310 app.M (2011) (\"This appendix provides policy and procedures that passport specialistsand consular officers must follow in cases in which an applicant requests a gender onthe passport application different from the one reflected on some or all of the sub-mitted citizenship and/or identity evidence, including a prior passport.\").72. In fact, birth certificates and driver's licenses are both referred to as \"breeder\" docu-ments because once a person had these forms of identification, other identity docu-ments can be created, with birth certificates being the primary breeder document.See John Mercer, Breeder Documents: The Keys to Identity, 29 KEESING J. OF Docu-MENTS & IDENTITY 14, 14 (2009), available at http://www.naphsis.org/NAPHSIS/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/00000000 1179/breederdocumentsthekeys-to_identity.pdf.392 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESRegulations under the REAL ID Act, which has been partially imple-mented in the U.S.,\" require persons to show they are a U.S. citizens or arein the U.S. lawfully, as well as \"establish their identity\" to obtain a driver'slicense.74 Accepted documents include birth certificates and passports (aswell as various immigration documents).75 Among U.S. citizens, birth cer-tificates are more commonly used because only 28% of the U.S. populationhave passports.76b. Discrimination in Employment-Some employers may discriminate against a transgender person, espe-cially in the hiring process, when the employer inspects identity documentsthat do not match a person's gender presentation. In much of the UnitedStates, this discrimination may be viewed as legal.77 For example, U.S. em-ployers are required to Fill out the I-9 Employment Eligibility VerificationForm for each employee at the time of hire. Although various documentscan be used to show eligibility for work, if a U.S. citizen does not have apassport or a Social Security card, he or she must show a birth certificate to73.

No. 109-13 § 202(c)(2)(b) (2005). Because the Real ID Actalso required gender to appear on the license, some state motor vehicle agencies wereconcerned that it would curtail their authority to set policies on gender corrections.However, the regulations issued by the Department of Homeland Security in 2008indicated the opposite. See 6 C.F.R. § 37.17 (2008).75. 6 C.F.R. § 37.11 (2011) (listing acceptable documents as a U.S. passport, a birthcertificate, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, a Permanent Resident Card, a U.S.visa, Certificate of Naturalization or Citizenship, a REAL ID-compliant driver's li-cense or identification card).76.

Although \"sex\" in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should be interpreted toprohibit employment discrimination against transgender people, not all federalcourts have agreed with this proposition. Compare Schroer v. Billington, 577 F.Supp. 2d 293, 300 (D.D.C. 2008) (holding that \"sex\" in Title VII protects thetransgender plaintiff), and Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1320 (11th Cit. 2011)(holding that plaintiffs termination due to transgender status was sex discriminationin violation of the Equal Protection Clause), with Etsitty v. Utah Transit Authority,502 F.3d 1215, 1221 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that the seK discrimination prohibi-tion does not protect a transgender plaintiff). Therefore, discrimination is onlyclearly illegal in the 16 states and over 150 local jurisdictions that have gender iden-tity/expression protections explicit in the law, which cover 45% of the US's popula-tion. NAT'L GAY & LESBIAN TASK FORCE, JURISDICTIONS WITH EXPLICIrLY-TRANSGENDER INCLUSIVE NONDISCRIMINATION LAws (2012), available at http:l/www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/factrsheets/all-jurisdictions-w.pop-6-12.pdf.2013] 393MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWsatisfy this requirement. If a person does have a Social Security card andtherefore can avoid showing a birth certificate, the person must also show anidentity document like a driver's license or school identity card. However,these documents may also have an inaccurate gender marker on them if theywere derived from an inaccurate birth certificate. Employers may also learnof a person's transgender status if a background check reveals the genderassigned at birth, based on documents derived from a birth certificate.The National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 90% oftransgender people had experienced mistreatment or discrimination at workor took actions to avoid such discrimination.78 Nearly 47% of those sur-veyed lost their jobs, were denied a promotion, or were denied a job as adirect result of being transgender.7 Hiring discrimination was also rampant,and rates of discrimination were higher for those whose driver's license gen-der marker did not match their gender identity.8o The percentages of thoseexperiencing hiring discrimination rose from 52% of those with correcteddriver's licenses to 64% for those without corrected driver's licenses.,' Forunderstandable reasons, many transgender people desire to keep their trans-gender identity private from employers at the time of hiring, yet may beunable to do so because of birth certificate policies in their jurisdiction ofbirth.Other discrimination can arise when a person goes through gendertransition while remaining in the same workplace. One of the primary issuesthat can arise is which bathroom a person should use. Many employersthink a fair policy is to have persons switch bathrooms when they havecorrected the gender on their driver's licenses, state identification docu-ments, or less commonly, their birth certificates. Because the gender on adriver's license often is generated by the gender on a person's birth certifi-cate, the state's failure to correct gender on birth certificates can prevent atransgender person from being able to access the appropriate gender-specificrestroom facility at the workplace.78.

Police, Security Personnel, and Others who Inspect IdentificationDuring Daily Life and TravelUnfortunately, it is not uncommon for police, security personnel, andothers to respond in violent or discriminatory ways when they discover aperson is transgender.82In addition, a police or security officer, or any other person who in-spects ID (such as a store clerk) may share information about a transgenderperson's status with others in the community, who in turn may cause theperson harm. For example, consider the case of a person who lives in a smallcommunity who presents identification with an inaccurate gender marker toa Transportation Security Officer at the local airport, or a store clerk toverify identity when using a credit card at the local market. When the clerkor officer discusses this information with others in the community, thetransgender individual could be fired from his or her job or becorne thevictim of a bias-motivated assault.The National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 40% ofpeople who presented identification that did not match their gender presen-tation were harassed at some point due to the mismatch, 15% were asked toleave an establishment, and 3% were assaulted. 3 Higher numbers of peopleof color were assaulted, with 9% of African Americans and Latino/Latinasand 6% of multiracial respondents reporting assault when presenting IDthat did not match their gender presentation. 4The data is supported by published reports of violence and discrimina-tion that have occurred after a person is outed as transgender. For example,in an incident brought to public consciousness by an award-winning movie,Brandon Teena was sexually assaulted and later murdered by those whoknew him as a man when they discovered, due to a printed police report inthe newspaper, that his legal name was \"Teena Brandon.\" 5 In a less violentcase, a transgender woman was sent a threatening letter and DVD sayingthat homosexuals should be put to death by the DMV clerk who hadprocessed her gender correction.8682. 22% of respondents reported harassment, 6% reported physical assault, and 2% re-ported sexual assault by police officers due to being transgender.

Furthermore, as proving one'slawful presence in the U.S. becomes more important as a political and/orcriminal matter, showing one's actual birth certificate-not just documentsderived from it-may become a more common practice. Already severalstates have passed laws that allow police to require people to show proof ofcitizenship.8 The Supreme Court approved the part of the Arizona law thatallows officers to ask for documentation of citizenship of those that theysuspect may be undocumented.8 8d. Marriage RecognitionTransgender people should also be able to marry, and be recognized aslegally married to their partners. Because forty-one states restrict marriage todifferent-sex couples, 8 9 a transgender person's gender is of great legal signifi-cance in those states. Being legally married, or not, is of great legal conse-quence to whether or not a person has rights to child custody and visitation.Additionally, marital status is important for intestate inheritance,90 ability tosue for wrongful death,91 spousal support after marriage, eligibility for So-cial Security benefits after death of a spouse, and potentially, the ability tobe granted a divorce and have marital property divided. For bi-nationalcouples, marriage recognition is critically important for the ability to residelegally in the United States. During the marriage, being recognized as aspouse by third parties can be important to determine eligibility for a hostof benefits, including health insurance, ability to make medical decisions for87.

Transgender people indifferent-sex marriages often worry their marriage will be nullified by ajudge's decision that they have not validly and legally changed their gender.Although there is no single place where one's \"legal gender\" is recorded, thegender on a person's birth certificate is sometimes given at least some legaldeference by courts. 92Because most of the marriage cases involving a transgender spouse in-dicate that having a corrected gender marker on one's birth certificate is nota controlling factor, the practical effect, in the form of discouraging thirdparties from challenging the legality of a marriage, is likely more importantthan the actual legal effect during a challenge.The story of a New Jersey couple-a non-transgender woman and atransgender man who had problems getting a marriage license-is illustra-tive. Because the transgender man's birth certificate still designated him asfemale, the local clerk refused to issue a marriage license and instead said shecould only issue them a civil union license. This issue was resolved onlyafter they consulted with an attorney, who helped the man get his birthcertificate amended. This process took several months, delaying many of thecouple's life plans, as well as requiring a significant financial outlay.9e. Health and Health Insurance RecordsBirth certificates and the documents they influence can also affectwhat gender people are considered to be by their health insurance providers,their health systems, their state's medical assistance program, or Medicare.Depending on what gender is recordedin these records, certain treatments,screenings and procedures may be disallowed, despite the fact that the bestpractice is to screen and treat all of a person's bodily organs, regardless of aperson's gender identity and regardless of whether or not the treatment re-lates to gender transition. For example, a transgender man might be deniedhormone therapy on the basis that he should not be receiving testosteronewhen his records indicate female. Or a transgender woman may be deniedneeded gynecological services because they are only covered for females.9492. See Kantaras v. Kantaras, 884 So. 2d 155, 161 (Fla. Dist. Ct.

Access to, and Treatment in, Sex-Segregated FacilitiesA small but important number of facilities are sex-segregated. Theserange from those needed on a daily basis-such as bathrooms-to those inotherwise non-segregated spaces-such as locker rooms in gyms. Further,there are a number of gender-segregated residential or quasi-residential facil-ities, programs or services that can be critically important and life-sus-taining, such as homeless shelters, group foster homes, substance abusefacilities (including court-mandated drug programs), and domestic violenceshelters. In these places, transgender people can be kept out of the correctfacility, or forced into the wrong facility, because of the gender on theiridentity documents, and violence can sometimes result. For example, al-though it is contrary to best practices developed nationally,95 in homelessshelters, transgender people are typically housed with others of their sexassigned at birth, which can create dangerous conditions.96 According to theNational Transgender Discrimination Survey, 55 percent of transgenderpeople who stayed at a shelter were harassed there and 22 percent weresexually assaulted there.97 In addition, 29 percent who sought shelter weredenied outright.98 In many emergency housing facilities, transgender peopleare processed by low-level intake staff who make on-the-spot decisionsabout where to place a person. Therefore, the gender markers on a person'sidentification documents take on heightened importance.99Although there is no case law on the question of how relevant a per-son's gender marker on his or her birth certificate is when it comes to hav-ing a legal right to access these sex-segregated facilities, certainly one canimagine that disputes with regard to access to any of these facilities could inpart hinge on gender markers on birth certificates.g.

For thisreason alone, some transgender students may decide not to apply throughthe Common Application, therefore limiting their access to higher educa-tion. Similarly, potential students may worry that if they write their birthcertificate gender on the Common Application, as they are required to do,they will be assigned to gendered dormitories on that basis.Women's colleges may also look to the gender designation on a poten-tial student's birth certificate or school records or other government docu-mentation derived from the birth certificate to determine whether a studentis eligible to attend.10sh.

Overview of Existing Legal Standards1. Standard from the MSVSA, State, and Local JurisdictionsThe 1977 MSVSA requires that a person seeking a correction to thegender on his or her birth certificate show that \"the sex of an individualborn in this State has been changed by surgical procedure\"'05 (terms notdefined in the model statute).o6 Thirteen jurisdictions use the exact lan-guage from the MSVSA in their statutes. 07 Another nine states 08 andGuam have a surgery standard in their statute, not using the language of theMSVSA. Several more states refer to gender corrections in statutes but donot specify that surgery must take place: Mississippi (\"gender reassign-ment\"), New Hampshire (\"has had a sex change\"), Utah (\"has had a sexchange\"), and Virginia (\"medical procedure\"). In three states, legislatureshave explicitly repudiated surgical or hormonal requirements, with languagenoting that \"surgery or other treatment\" (lowao9), \"clinically appropriatetreatment\" (California) or \"surgical, hormonal, or other treatment\" (Ver-mont) will suffice.IsoSome states do not address gender corrections in statute, but deal withthem in official regulations or written, sub-regulatory policy. Connecticut,105. MODEL STATE VITAL STATISTIcs AcT AND REGULATIONS § 21(d) (Ctr. for DiseaseControl & Prevention 1992) (emphasis added).106. There is no published case law interpreting the term \"surgical procedure.\"107. Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, NewJersey, New Mexico, and Oregon. (Montana integrates the language from theMSVSA into its regulations, not statute). See infra app. A.108. Arizona, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, North Car-olina, and Wisconsin. See infra app. A.109. Iowa has statutory language making it clear that surgery is not required. The coderequires a \"notarized affidavit by a licensed physician and surgeon or osteopathicphysician and surgeon stating that by reason of surgery or other treatment by thelicensee, the sex designation of the person has been changed.\" IoWA CODE ANN.§ 144.23 (West 2009) (emphasis added). However, the fact that the law twice says\"and surgeon\" in referring to the physician that must provide the letter seems toimply, for those unfamiliar with Iowa's medical code, that a surgeon is involved inthe person's care. In fact, all physicians in Iowa are referred to, throughout Iowacode, as \"physician and surgeon.\" See, e.g., IoWA CODE ANN. § 147.139 (West2011). In practice, despite the statutory rejection of a surgery requirement, the IowaDepartment of Public Health does require proof of surgical treatment. See Spade,supra note 4, at 768.110. See infra app. A.[Vol. 19:373400MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESMaine, Montana, New York City, and North Dakota each have surgicalrequirements in official regulations, although their statutes are silent.\"' InNew York State, a written policy requires surgery even where the regulationsand statutes do not. In Virginia, even though the statute specifies only a\"medical procedure,\" the regulations require surgery.1 12In Kansas, Mississippi, Nevada, and Wyoming, there is no statutorylanguage related to gender corrections, and the official regulations are am-biguous with regard to whether surgery is required.\" In two more states,Florida and Rhode Island, there is no official written policy but surgery isessentially required in practice.14Regardless of the exact language used relating to surgery, medicaltreatment, or gender corrections more generally, there are a wide variety ofsurgeries deemed sufficient to be eligible for the correction of a gendermarker. For example, as a practical matter, sometimes any surgery will qual-ify an individual for correction, but other times an agency will have strict(generally unwritten) rules that a particular surgery must be shown.'\"In nine jurisdictions, the judge determines the standard because there isno statutory or regulatory language, or the language is too vague.\"' Anadditional three states let people choose to get a court order.' 17While acourt order requirement does not explicitly mean proof of surgery is neces-sary, generally advocates have found this to be the case in practice.\" 8 Al-though there has been at least one instance where a person has successfullyreceived a court-ordered correction to her birth certificate without surgery,111.

Modernized Laws and PoliciesAlthough it has been decades since most state's legislatures or policy-makers have examined their policies regarding gender corrections, Washing-ton, Vermont, and California have done so in the last few years. As a result,these three states have the laws or policies that most closely comport withcontemporary medical and legal standards and warrant closer examination.In addition, the standard from the U.S. Department of State with regard toConsular Reports of Birth Abroad, updated in 2010, and the U.K. GenderRecognition Act from 2004 are also helpful.a. WashingtonThe Washington statute governing birth certificates gives the Secretaryof Health broad authority to administer birth certificates.120 Because thestatute does not mention gender corrections specifically, the Secretary ofHealth has empowered the Director of the Center for Health Statistics todevelop the policy. The policy currently in effectl21 has been in place sinceJuly 1, 2008 and, according to staff at the agency, is a codification of theunwritten policy that was in effect for many years.122 The policy requires aregistrant to submit a written request and to include a \"letter, on applicableletterhead, from the requestor's medical or osteopathic physician statingthat the requestor has had the appropriate clinical treatment.\"123b.

Treatment \"appropriate\" to an indi-vidual may be limited to living full-time in one's new gender role.However, the statute also requires a person to have \"completed\" sexualreassignment.12 9 While this should not cause significant confusion, usingthe term \"completed\" may unduly exclude some people who have fully tran-sitioned but hope or plan for additional medical treatment later in life. Fur-thermore, since many individuals receive hormonal treatment indefinitely,they may be seen as never having \"completed\" treatment.c.

Standard from the United Kingdom's Gender Recognition ActThe United Kingdom's Gender Recognition Act of 2004 requires thatindividuals live in their \"acquired gender\" for at least two years and have adiagnosis of gender dysphoria.13 4 An individual must submit reports by twomedical professionals, one of whom must be an expert in the field of genderdysphoria, detailing any medical treatment that the person has had. Theindividual must also affirm that he or she intends to continue to live in theiracquired gender until death.135Although this policy has the advantage of not requiring surgery or anyspecific medical treatment, the requirement of living in the \"acquired gen-der\" for two years is both arbitrary and burdensome, heightening one's riskof violence, discrimination, and harassment for that two-year period. Simi-larly, the fact that one of the medical professionals submitting their evalua-tion must be practicing in the field of gender dysphoria is unduly limitingfor those who live in rural or other areas that do not have access to theseprofessionals.

Issues to Consider When Modernizing the Legal StandardWhen considering how to update the legal standard, policymakersshould look to the modern medical understanding of transgender people,the effect of the surgical standard on transgender people, how other areas ofthe law have acknowledged transgender people, the constitutional impact ofthese policies, and the public policy justifications and implications.1. A Surgical Requirement Contradicts Current Medical UnderstandingCurrent medical thinking has rejected the one-size-fits-all mentalitythat was common in early treatment of trnsgender people. In the middle ofthe twentieth century, the medical community's viewpoint, developed by asmall set of early practitioners, was that genital surgery was the successfulculmination of a person's treatment and gender transition. Although thelived reality of transgender people never uniformly reflected this under-standing, it was widely believed then and continues to persist today amongthe general population.137 As more providers began treating transgenderpeople and contributed to medical literature and practice over the past sev-eral decades, the view of transgender medicine greatly evolved andexpanded.The World Professional Association for Transgender Health(WPATH), established in 1979, is the international medical association de-voted to understanding and properly treating transgender people. WPATHdevelops and publishes the collective understanding of the best treatmentfor transgender people based on \"the best available science and expert pro-fessional consensus,\" known now as the \"Standards of Care for the Healthof Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People.\"138WPATH has altered its Standards of Care six times since 1979 to reflect thecontinually evolving medical understanding of transgender people and theefficacy of various treatment protocols.'13136. For various reasons, requiring people in the U.S. to get a diagnosis would be illadvised. First, some people cannot get a diagnosis because of limited access to doc-tors or counselors (less of an issue in the U.K. where socialized medicine is in place).Second, people who are deemed not \"clinically distressed\" enough may not receivethe diagnosis. Third, some doctors and counselors have a limited viewpoint aboutwho should receive the diagnosis. See infra note 153 and accompanying text.137. Spade, supra note 4, at 755.138. WORLD PROF. Ass'N FOR TRANSGENDER HEALTH, supra note 33.139. Id.4052013]1MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER 6, LAWOver this time period, WPATH increasingly encouraged and requiredindividualized evaluation and individualized treatment, reflecting both itsincreasingly multi-disciplinary membership and the best available science.The Standards of Care refer to themselves as \"flexible clinical guidelines\" 4oand state that treatment is to be individualized.' 4 ' As discussed earlier, thecurrent Standards of Care are clear that changes in gender role alone may besufficient treatment for some transgender people.142Recognizing that surgery is not necessary for many transgender peo-ple, as well as the fact that many of these procedures result in sterilization,WPATH issued a statement condemning surgical requirements in 2010,stating, \"[nlo person should have to undergo surgery or accept sterilizationas a condition of identity recognition . . . .\" The WPATH Board of Direc-tors urges governments and other authoritative bodies to move to eliminaterequirements for identity recognition that require surgical procedures.\"14 3In addition to WPATH, other experts have recommended de-linkingsocial and legal recognition of gender from specific medical treatments. Theforemost organization for psychologists in the United States, the AmericanPsychological Association, released a statement with its medical, social, andlegal recommendations related to transgender people in August of 2008,which stated:THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT APAencourages legal and social recognition of transgender individu-als consistent with their gender identity and expression, includ-ing access to identity documents consistent with their genderidentity and expression which do not involuntarily disclose their140.

Often with thehelp of psychotherapy, some individuals integrate their trans- or cross-gender feel-ings into the gender role they were assigned at birth and do not feel the need tofeminize or masculinize their body. For others, changes in gender role and expressionare sufficient to alleviate gender dysphoria. Some patients may need hormones, apossible change in gender role, but not surgery; others may need a change in genderrole along with surgery, but not hormones. In other words, treatment for genderdysphoria has become more individualized.\" Id., at 2 (citations omitted).143.

Surgery is Not Common and is Often UnattainableSex reassignment surgeries are significantly less common than is popu-larly believed. Transgender people have a variety of medical, personal, andpractical reasons for not seeking or being able to acquire surgery. Here arecommon barriers and considerations:(1) Some individuals cannot afford the surgery they desire, es-pecially given that a large majority of private and publichealth insurance plans do not currently'4 cover sex reas-signment surgeries.' 4 6(2) Many people have medical conditions that make surgeryrisky or contraindicated.14 7144.

When aperson undergoes surgical treatment, his or her time and resources, as wellas those of others, would be spent securing and recovering from this treat-ment. Complications may also occur, adding new health problems. A cas-cade of unnecessary expenditures result from surgeries, including depletingone's personal financial resources, causing an interruption in one's school orwork, being unable to complete family care-giving duties, and relying onfinancial or care-giving resources from family members or others.1583. A Surgical Requirement is Inconsistent with Other Public PoliciesRelated to Transgender PeopleAs legal rights and recognition of transgender people have rapidly in-creased in the past two decades in the United States, there has been a cleartrend that such rights do not depend on whether a person has had specificmedical treatments.15 9 Most pertinently, non-discrimination laws that covertransgender people prohibit discrimination on the basis of \"gender identityor expression,\" or similar language, regardless of whether a person has hador is seeking medical treatment.160 This implies that transgender peopleshould have the freedom to live their daily lives consistent with their genderidentities without facing discrimination or restrictions. In 2011, legislatorsin Maine considered a bill that would have narrowed the existing non-dis-crimination protections for transgender people in that state by granting theauthority to businesses to limit access to sex-segregated facilities based on\"biological sex.\" This bill was handily defeated (61-81 in the House, 11-23158. All of these have potential public health consequences in direct or indirect ways,ranging from a person not having resources to be treated for other medical condi-tions and causing medical issues where none existed before to not being able to carefor another family member because of having to recover from surgery.

Tobin, Fair and Accurate Identification, supra note 4.4112013]MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWthe Real ID Act initially caused some state agencies to be concerned aboutany changes to driver's license data, stricter, surgery-based policies on gen-der markers were not promulgated.166 Despite the terrorism scare, the trendin the last decade has been away from surgery-based policies and towardgender identity-based policies.167 The District of Columbia currently has amodel policy because it provides a corrected gender marker upon (1) signeddocumentation from the license holder that they are seeking to have thegender on their license corrected to reflect their gender identity, and (2) thesignature of a health or social service professional who attests, in their pro-fessional opinion, that the person's gender is as stated.168 Slightly modifiedversions of D.C.'s policy have been adopted in New Jersey, Maine, Massa-chusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Although not modeledon the D.C. policy, new policies that eliminated surgery requirements havealso been adopted in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, and Ohio.Many other states have long maintained non-surgery based policies.169Furthermore, although not yet adopted nationally, the trend with re-gard to homeless shelter policies is increasingly to house people based ontheir self-identified gender, regardless of whether a person has had any med-ical treatments. Because most homeless shelters are segregated by gender and166. One state to roll its policy back was Michigan, which had a policy of self-identifica-tion a decade ago. Under the old policy, a person only had to sign a generic form(used for many purposes), writing a sentence that stated that he or she wished thegender on his or her license changed, and the correction was granted, with questionsby the staff prohibited. The policy stated: \"DO NOT ASK THE APPLICANT TOSPECIFY THE REASON FOR THE REQUEST.\" MICH. DEP'T OF STATE, TR-34, CHANGING GENDER (1995) (on file with author).

In 2003, theNational Coalition for the Homeless adopted a resolution urging shelters tohouse people according to their \"self-identified gender.\"170 Shelter systems,such as those in Boston, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington,D.C., have had formal policies to this effect for years and the implementa-tion has not caused any problems.171In sum, legislatures and policymakers in a variety of arenas have deter-mined that surgical treatment is immaterial to whether a person should berecognized in accord with the person's gender identity.4. Reasons Given for a Surgical Requirement are Not ValidOriginally, recognizing that surgery changed a person's gender was aprogressive idea-it provided a way for transgender people to correct theirgender markers on official government documents whereas before, there wasno option to correct the gender marker at all. Generally, courts and agencieshave not articulated a state interest in a surgery requirement, presumablybecause the choice of surgery was so obvious as the dividing line betweenmale and female that the reason it had been used was not seen as necessaryto articulate. Thus, it is difficult to locate arguments in favor of a surgeryrequirement. The few examined below are taken mostly from driver's licenseand marriage recognition contexts, and one policy debate on birth certifi-cates in New York City. The arguments can be understood best as threeseparate concerns; as such, they are each explained and analyzed in turn.a. Fraud or SecurityOn the rare occasions when a court or agency tries to justify a surgicalstandard, the government sometimes articulates an interest in \"fraud pre-170.

Interview with Mara Keisling, supra note 158.2013] 413MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWvention.\"172 This issue often arises in reference to same-sex marriage, 73 andsometimes is presented more generally and vaguely as a potential securityproblem. For example, there has been the suggestion that terrorists174 couldtake advantage of the ability to alter gender markers on birth certificates.With regard to marriage, most states do not require a person to show abirth certificate when applying for a marriage license; instead, they typicallyrequire a driver's license,175 which, as discussed above, often allow people tochange their gender markers without proof of surgery. There have been noreported cases of same-sex couples made up of two non-transgender peoplewhere one person changes the gender marker on a driver's license for thepurpose of receiving a marriage license.'7 6With regard to the claim that people may disguise their gender to bebetter able to commit crimes or terrorist acts, one prominent transgenderadvocate has commented that the last thing a person who is trying to blendin and escape notice should do is dress in the opposite gender.\"'1 Further-more, federal policy implicitly indicates that gender marker changes do notimpair national security interests. For example, in implementing the RealID Act, the Department of Homeland Security decided to \"leave the deter-172.

The implausibility that non-transgender people would fraudulently seek a gendercorrection on their birth certificate in order to receive a marriage license is easilyrebutted when analogized to different situations. For example, typically people un-derstand that fraudulent manipulations, such as a 13 year-old pretending to be 18,would not require the government to recognize a marriage involving a 13 year old.Similarly, non-transgender gay and lesbian people generally understand that theywill not receive a legally valid marriage by fraudulently changing the gender markeron their government identity documents.177. Interview with Mara Keisling, supra note 158; GRANT ET AL., supra note 54, at 163(noting that seven percent of participants \"reported being arrested or held in a cellstrictly due to bias of police officers on the basis of gender identity/expression\").414 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESmination of gender up to the States.\" 178 Further, the State Department al-lows individuals to update gender markers on their passports withoutsurgery. '7 These should be taken as indications that gender was not animportant classification related to prevention of terrorism in the federal gov-ernment's view.In fact, there are particularly strong arguments that security and lawenforcement agencies' ability to protect the public is enhanced by havinggender marker policies that are not based on surgeries, but are instead basedupon the gender to which a person has transitioned. Transgender peopleoften report being delayed, detained, or otherwise harassed by law enforce-ment officers because the gender marker on their ID does not match theirexternal gender expression.o80 Sometimes officers are concerned the ID isfraudulent and take various steps to determine the legitimacy of the docu-ment. This extra scrutiny consumes law enforcement resources that are bet-ter spent identifying truly counterfeit identity documents or dealing withother law enforcement duties.A second advantage for law enforcement of accurate, up-to-date gen-der markers involves situations in which police officers respond to crimes,identify witnesses, or attempt to locate persons of interest. The officer at-tempting to locate someone is better served by knowing the gender that theperson is known as by friends and acquaintances, who may be confused orunhelpful when the officer asks about the \"woman\" or \"man\" who lives nextdoor. Similarly, when the officers interact with a victim or a witness, theyare more likely to alienate a transgender man, with a female designation onhis license, by using the terms \"ma'am\" and \"Ms.,\" or by using \"sir\" or\"Mr.\" for a transgender woman. This alienation could make the transgenderperson, or others aware of the disrespect shown, less likely to trust, inform,and work with police in the instant case or in future situations.In conclusion, there are no realistic fraud or security concerns that areaddressed by maintaining a surgery requirement. On the contrary, federal178. 6 C.F.R. § 37.17 (2008) (\"Requirements for the surface of the driver's license oridentification card.

Interview with Mara Keisling, supra note 159.4152013]1MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER dr LAWsecurity experts at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S.Department of State have instead established or changed policies to allowgender markers to be updated without surgery.b. Permanence of the CorrectionOccasionally, an administrator or judge will state the desire for perma-nence or irreversibility as a requirement for granting a correction of gen-der.,,, Presumably, the concern is that someone could \"switch back\" afterchanging their gender. The harm to society if a person undergoes a gendercorrection more than once is never explicitly identified.182A policymaker misses the mark if he or she focuses on avoiding multi-ple corrections. The proper agency aim should be to maintain accuraterecords. A record should be updated to maintain accuracy as often as thereis a change to relevant data. For example, if a person changes his or hername four times over their life due for various reasons, and seeks to amendtheir birth certificate each time, updating the birth certificate several timesmaintains an accurate record for them throughout his or her entire life.In addition, research proves that a concern about impermanence isunsupported by the evidence. Data show that a return to previous genderhappens extremely rarely and is generally a result of discrimination and re-jection from family, friends, and colleagues.'\"3 A person is no less likely totransition back to the originally assigned gender after surgery as opposed tobefore surgery.'8 4There is another reliable way in which people can indicate to theagency that they have undergone medically-recognized gender change:namely, an evaluation by a medical professional. An evaluation from a med-ical professional should be sufficient to determine if an individual has un-181. Cave, supra note 155 (quoting the city's health commissioner as saying \"[s]urgeryversus nonsurgery can be arbitrary[.] . . . Somebody with a beard may have hadbreast-implant surgery. It's the permanence of the transition that matters most.\").Maryland's highest court, in considering whether the judicial system has authority togrant a legal order of gender change, decided that the court's equitable jurisdictiondid cover such orders, and remanded for the courts below to determine whether thepetitioner had \"completed a permanent and irreversible change from male to fe-male.\" In re R.W. Heilig, 816 A.2d 68, 87 (Md. 2003).182. Although the administrative burden of having to process multiple changes may be acause for concern, this could be addressed by charging fees for corrections. It isdifficult to imagine what other harms may exist without resorting to concerns aboutmaintaining sex stereotypes or differences between the sexes.183. See M. Landen et al., Factors Predictive of Regret in Sex Reassignment, 97 AcrAPSYCHIATRICA SCANDINAVICA 284 (1998).184. Even a surgical requirement does not eliminate the possibility of a person changinggender a second time. Relevant surgical procedures could be reversed or undertakento change a person's body again.416 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESdergone a gender transition and that the gender marker should be changed.Because no method can guarantee that a person may not elect to transitiontheir gender a second time, the method of deferring to a medical profes-sional should be sufficient.A policy allowing a larger majority of people to have accurate birthcertificates should not be dismissed due to conjecture concerning outlierswho may change their gender more than once, especially because there is noarticulation of the harm to society caused by multiple gender corrections.Instead, the focus should remain on maintaining accurate records.c. Concerns About Sex-Specific Facilities and SituationsSometimes government actors, or others who favor surgical require-ments, claim that sex-segregated institutions need to know people's anatom-ical structure, either to ensure bodily privacy or for the prevention ofassault.'15 Or, they may assert that for sex-specific jobs or job duties, such asthose that might exist in a nursing or medical facility (although increasinglyrare), bodily privacy of clients would be violated if a staff member of oneanatomical structure observes or treats an unclothed client of another ana-tomical structure. 86 Yet, on a daily basis and in almost all social situations, a185. Yoshino, supra note 171 (describing reservations \"voiced by institutions like hospi-tals, jails, and schools, which routinely segregate according to sex\" and explainingothers' potential objections). Yoshino also notes that:\"Another moment of reflection suggests at least four interests that a person or thestate might have in another person's gender. First, personal safety: Many communalspaces, like prison cells and public bathrooms, are segregated by sex to protectwomen, who are generally physically weaker than men, from assault or rape. Second,privacy: As employnent-discrimination law recognizes, individuals have an interestin ensuring that their sexual privacy is not invaded by members of the opposite sex incontexts like nursing or medical care. . . . There is little evidence that transgenderindividuals present a security risk to women, while there is a great deal of evidencethat transgender individuals themselves are at immense risk if they are not givenaccommodations. To the extent that privacy concerns rest on a fear of sexual objecti-fication, they rely on a specious assumption of universal heterosexuality.\" See alsoDaniel Trotta, New York Rejects Transgender Birth Certificate Law, REUTERS, Dec. 5,2006 (quoting a health department official as saying \"how can you send a personwith a penis to a women's prison?\").186. \"As employment-discrimination law recognizes, individuals have an interest in ensur-ing that their sexual privacy is not invaded by members of the opposite sex in con-texts like nursing or medical care.\" Yoshino, supra note 171. However, it should benoted that the case law on this question is quite old and modern nursing practices,for example, do not include dividing tasks by sex. See, e.g., Backus v.

Within these contexts, before or at the relevant moment, a personwill generally disclose to the authorities that he or she has a different ana-tomical structure than is typical for that facility. As a general rule, trans-gender people who have not had genital surgery are very likely to go to greatlengths to avoid having other people observe their unclothed bodies. If theyare able to do so, their bodily characteristics should not be considered rele-vant. If one is not able to keep their body private, the facility will learn ofthe person's bodily anatomy as a practical matter, typically through volun-tary verbal disclosure188Individuals who believe that transgender people should complete sur-gery before being allowed to change their birth certificates often cite theprotection of women as their main goal. More specifically, these individualsfeel that transgender women who have not undergone surgery will enterwomen's bathrooms and locker rooms to sexually assault non-transgenderwomen who also frequent those facilities. However, this concern is based onseveral incorrect assumptions, including that access to these facilities is cur-rently based on the gender marker listed on a person's birth certificate.tion that she received related to this was during cultural competence training, whereshe was instructed that some Muslim patients may request nurses of the same gen-der). Also relevant to the issue of gender-specific tasks related to bodily privacy arestudies done on whether women prefer male or female gynecologists. Data suggestthat gender is not particularly important when women choose gynecologists. SeeMichael Zuckerman et al., Determinants of Women's Choice of Obstetrician/Gynecolo-gist, 11 J. WOMEN'S HEALTH & GENDER-BASED MED. 175, 175-76 (2002) (find-ing that 62% of women did not feel strongly about the gender of their provider andthat \"almost as many women with a female provider indicated a preference for amale provider (46%) as women with male providers indicated a preference for afemale provider (54%)\"); Amy M.

It is difficult to imagine an instance where a transgender woman, who still has malegenitalia and who has struggled all her life to be seen as a woman by others, wouldwalk into an open women's shower without attempting to conceal that area of herbody.418 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESIn fact, the large majority of sex-segregated facilities do not maintainwritten policies with regard to restroom access. Although this is changing,the default rule is essentially a social one: if you look like a man, you can usethe men's room and if you look like a woman, you can use the women'sroom.When a person's gender is challenged, a person is likely to receiveaccess only if they can present identification with a matching gendermarker. An entity will sometimes ask for additional information, such assurgical status, before allowing access. Those who do not have the correctgender on their ID (which is more likely for those whose birth certificatesare inaccurate) may be asked to show documentation of their surgical status,a letter from their health care provider, or other official documentation.The stated concerns are further undermined by the fact that a widerange of companies, organizations, and public places already have in placebest practices dictating use of facilities by transgender people. These policiesexplain that transgender people may and should use the restroom and/orlocker rooms according to their gender identity, not their anatomical struc-ture.'8 9 As explained above, non-discrimination laws, which cover 45 per-cent of the U.S. population,'\"9 are regularly interpreted to ensure thattransgender people can access restroom and shower facilities based on theirgender identity, regardless of their anatomical status. Moreover, there are noreported cases of these laws being used to gain improper access to a facilityfor criminal purposes.Thus, allowing transgender individuals to correct the gender markeron their birth certificates would not markedly alter the existing trend tobase access to facilities on self-identity.The alleged importance of a surgical standard is also sometimes as-serted when discussing placement of individuals who are incarcerated. Thefear is that non-transgender women in jail, prison, or juvenile justice facili-ties will be sexually assaulted by transgender women who have not yet hadsurgery. First, it is important to understand that gender markers on birthcertificates have almost no influence on where people are placed in prison,juvenile justice facilities, and longer-term jail stays.'9 ' The only cognizable189.

Second, for a variety of reasons, 192 police are likelyto know that the person they arrested is transgender. Thus, even if a per-son's birth certificate had been altered to reflect their identified gender priorto surgery, the police are unlikely to make housing decisions based on thecertificate. As a result, birth certificate policies could only potentially affectan extremely small percentage of transgender women's placement. 93Furthermore, just as in homeless shelters and sex-segregated spacesgenerally, there is a new standard related to the placement of transgenderpeople in jails and prisons. This standard makes a transgender person'sphysical anatomy only one consideration in housing determinations. Therecently promulgated Prison Rape Elimination Act regulations which applyto all prisons, jails, and lockups in the U.S., set forth exactly this policy: thathousing classification, including whether a person is to be housed in themale or female facility, be made on a case-by-case basis.9 4 Notably, genderternal genitalia, regardless of documentation. See Farmer v. Haas, 990 F.2d 319, 320(7th Cit. 1993) (\"The practice of the federal prison authorities ... is to incarceratepersons who have completed sexual reassignment with prisoners of the transsexual'snew gender, but to incarcerate persons who have not completed it with prisoners ofthe transsexual's original gender.\").192. Strip searches when being placed in a cell or holding area with others are commonfor those who are arrested for violent crimes or drug-related activity so that policecan look for weapons, drugs, or other contraband. See Brief of the A.B.A. as AmicusCuriae in Support of Petitioner, Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of theCounty of Burlington (June 27, 2011) (No. 10-945), 2011 WL 2578557, at *8,*12-*14. Furthermore, if people have been arrested before, their arrest or criminalrecord should disclose their transgender status to arresting police. Finally, police,depending on what is available to them from the driver's license database, are likelyto be able to quickly determine whether the arrestee has undergone a name changeby examining their driving record, so unless the person had a gender-neutral name atbirth, the name change would likely disclose to officers that the arrestee istransgender.193. In order for the police not to determine that a transgender woman arrestee is trans-gender, she would have to (1) be arrested for the first time, (2) be arrested for a non-violent crime not involving drugs, (3) not be visibly transgender, and (4) have adriver's license record that does not indicate that a gender or name change occurred.194.

In making the assessment, the agency shall consider on a case-by-case basiswhether a placement would ensure the inmate's health and safety, and whether theplacement would present management or security problems.

Thesenew policies are being established because of the very real levels of sexualviolence transgender women face when housed in male areas of jails, pris-ons, and juvenile justice facilities. According to a University of California-Irvine study in 2007, transgender women in male units experience thirteentimes more sexual assault than non-transgender men in the unit.19 5Last, it is also important to note that one court has found that a fe-male inmate had no right to a different cellmate after she had been placedwith a transgender woman who had not had genital surgery. In this case,the court considered whether the inmate possessed a clear constitutionalright to be housed with someone having the same anatomical structure andconcluded that they did not.1 96 Thus, the only court to consider whetherthere was a right for an inmate to be housed with an anatomically similarirnare has concluded that no such right exists.Ultimately, transgender women using or living in sex-segregated facili-ties do not create or increase threats to non-transgender women, regardlessof whether those facilities are bathrooms, jails, prisons, homeless shelters,foster care group homes, or college dormitories. In fact, many of these facili-ties long ago voluntarily abandoned surgical or anatomy-based require-ments, recognizing that safety and fairness dictate that transgender peoplebe provided access to the facility that matches their gender identity. Thus,while updating the legal standard for correcting birth certificates will havesome positive effects for some transgender people who are currently deniedaccess to sex-segregated facilities because of their lack of government iden-tity documents, overall, there will be little to no noticeable effect on therecommendation after interviewing the transgender inmate based on safety/securityneeds, housing availability, gender identity, and genitalia); KING COUNTY, WASH-INGTON DEP'T OF ADULT AND JUVENILE DETENTION, ADULT DivisioNs, GENERALPOLICY MANUAL 6.03.007 TRANSCENDER INMATES (2006) (assigning inmates'housing based on their safety/security needs, housing availability, gender identity,and genitalia).195.

Surgical Requirements Raise Serious Constitutional ConcernsThe surgical requirement for gender correction raises both Equal Pro-tection and Substantive Due Process concerns.There is a well-founded Equal Protection Clause argument to be madethat a surgical requirement discriminates against the class of transgenderpeople-who all must have surgery or else be denied an accurate birth cer-tificate-compared to non-transgender people who have accurate birth cer-tificates without being required to undergo surgery.197 Depending on whichlevel of scrutiny the court would apply to the class of transgender people, atminimum, there would have to be a legitimate state interest that the surgicalpolicy was rationally related to advancing. None of the policy reasons re-lated to fraud, permanence, and sex-segregated facilities, which were articu-lated and dismissed in this Section, should be considered rationally relatedto a legitimate'98 state interest.199197. A second approach under the Equal Protection Clause would be to compare trans-gender people who have had surgery versus those who have not had surgery. Thistype of distinction, based on surgical status, is more likely to receive rational basisreview.198. Interests of prevention of fraud and security, and safety, may all be legitimate, how-ever, the surgical rule fails because it is not rationally related to advancing theseinterests.199. Presumably, the government might also make an argument that a surgical standard issimply easier to administrate than other options. Given the multitude of differentsurgeries that a person may receive, as well as the fact that the way most agenciesdetermine that surgery has been undergone is through a letter or other documentfrom a health care provider, it should not be more difficult to process a letter or otherdocument from a provider stating that the person has had appropriate treatment forthe purpose of gender transition. Thus, the argument that surgery is an easier stan-dard to administrate is faulty.422 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESMoreover, there is a sound argument that transgender people deserveeither heightened200 or strict scrutiny201 in Equal Protection analysis. If theformer, the reasons for the policy would need to be \"important\" and thepolicy would need to be \"substantially related\" to forwarding that interest.If the latter, the policy reasons would need to be \"compelling\" and thepolicy would need to be \"narrowly-tailored\" to advancing that interest. Evenif a court was to declare that the state interests were \"legitimate\" and theclassification was rationally related to meeting that interest, which wouldenable it to pass rational basis review, these policy justifications should cer-tainly fail under heightened review or strict scrutiny.There are also a series of rights implicated by surgical requirementsthat could be protected by the Substantive Due Process protections of the200. H-ieightened or \"intermediate\" scrutiny iprovided for all clssifications based ongender. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996). A good argument can bemade that this issue qualifies for heightened scrutiny because at its most basic level,the government is making a classification based on gender when it is determiningwhich gender marker is appropriate and it is potentially judging or classifying aperson based on their sexual characteristics, which may be related to sex stereotypesabout what makes a man and a woman. See Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1316(11th Cir. 2011) (reasoning that a \"person is defined as transgender precisely becauseof the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes\" and there-fore that discrimination against transgender individuals on the basis of their gendernon-conformity constitutes sex-based discrimination under the Equal ProtectionClause, which receives heightened scrutiny). In addition, the Department of Justicereleased a report saying that all LGBT people should receive heightened scrutiny.U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE, CIVIL RIGHTS Div., INVESTIGATION OF THE NEW ORLE-ANS POLICE DEPARTMENT 33 (2011) available at, http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/nopd-report.pdf (\"[Wle note that a number of factors weigh in favor of applyingheightened scrutiny in the context of discrimination by law enforcement on the basisof sexual orientation and gender identity, including a long history of animus anddeeply-rooted stereotypes about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ('LGBT')individuals.\").201. In determining whether to apply a heightened level of scrutiny, the Supreme Courthas set forth two requirements: (1) that the group affected have been historicallyvictims of discrimination by the government, and (2) that the characteristics thatdifferentiate the group bear \"no relation\" to the ability of members of that group tocontribute to society. See Mass. Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313(1976); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973). In addition, courts havesometimes considered whether the characteristics that define the group are immuta-ble and whether the group is politically powerless. See Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S.1, 9 n.1 1 (1977) (demonstrating the flexibility of immutability by holding that clas-sifications based on alienage warrant heightened scrutiny even though they can natu-ralize); San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973) (findingthat poor families are not politically powerless). Transgender people should be ableto meet the two required factors and also satisfy the two other characteristics thatcourts have considered. Therefore, they should be deemed a \"suspect class\" for pur-poses of applying Equal Protection analysis.2013] 423MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWConstitution. First, there is a long-established right to be free of unwantedmedical treatment.202 Second, there is a long line of cases establishing theright to choose parenthood and control one's reproductive capacity. 203Third, there is a right to be free of sterilization.204 The latter two rights arerestricted by surgical requirements because sterilization and other effects onone's reproductive capacity are inherent in many sex reassignment surgeries.In addition, a good argument can be made for a previously unrecognizedright to gender self-determination.205 Thus, if the government desires tolimit any of these rights-which a surgical requirement does206-the gov-ernment action would need to be justified by a compelling state interest,with the policy narrowly tailored to forwarding that interest. 207 As previ-ously discussed, however, the articulated policy reasons for a surgical re-quirement do not meet that standard.All of the Substantive Due Process arguments should also be consid-ered valid public policy concerns, even if a court would not accept them asconstitutionally guaranteed freedoms. For example, some would argue thatthe highly personal and private nature of a person's decisions regarding sur-gical options should not be interfered with by the government, that an indi-vidual's bodily integrity should be protected against government intrusion,and finally, that sterilization should not be required of any citizen without aserious public policy justification.202. See, e.g., Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990).203. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965); Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113(1973); Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).204. See, e.g., Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942).205. This argument would be based on Lawrence and, more generally, existing Substan-tive Due Process jurisprudence that recognizes a person's intimate and personal deci-sions should be respected absent government need to the contrary. Lawrence v.Texas, 510 U.S. 538 (2003). There is also international support for the existence ofthis right. See Goodwin v. United Kingdom, Eur. Ct. H.R. 1 (2002).206. A surgical requirement can interfere with these rights for several reasons. First, formany, surgery is unwanted medical treatment. Second, a side effect of surgery isoften sterilization, which would interfere with one's ability to parent and controlone's reproductive capacity. Third, a person's right to gender self-determination isinterfered with when the government insists upon providing official governmentdocuments that contradict one's self-determination and disclosing this informationto third parties.207. The rights listed are typically referred to as findamental rights, although the Courtmay be shifting to a \"liberty interest\" frame, where the requirement that rightsbeconnected to or established by our nation's history is no longer present. In addition,the test for the restriction of fundamental rights may be becoming less rigid. For adiscussion of the evolution of substantive due process analysis, see Laurence H.Tribe, Lawrence v. Texas: The \"Fundamental Right\" That Dare Not Speak Its Name,117 HARV. L. REV. 1893, 1897-98 (2004).424 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESRegardless of the strength of these arguments, state governmentsshould be concerned that they will be subject to litigation, potentially basedon state or federal constitutional provisions. Two lawsuits were filed in 2011challenging surgical requirements for updating birth certificates and driver'slicenses.20sC. Specific Recommendation for Legal Standard for Gender CorrectionIndividuals should be permitted to correct the gender marker on theirbirth certificates if they make a gender transition that is medically recog-nized, using a modern medical understanding of transgender people. As of-ficial government records, birth certificates must remain reliable documents;therefore, it is important to establish a process to ensure that the amend-ments are reliable. Usually, agencies require external verification when indi-viduals wish to imake other corrections to their birth crtificates (e.g name,paternity, etc.). In order to put forth a statute that will be acceptable bygovernment agencies, some compromise 209 in the form of external verifica-208. In Alaska, the state ACLU challenged the driver's license / state identification cardpolicy of requiring surgery on the grounds that it violated substantive/fundamentalrights protected by the Alaska Constitution.

In a Memorandum of Decision, the judge determined that the sur-gery-based policy was not enacted with appropriate procedure, thus struck it down,not reaching the larger constitutional claims brought by the plaintiffs. However, thejudge did determine that the agency not having a gender correction policy at allconstituted a breach of the right to privacy of the transgender licensee.

In New York,the New York City birth certificate policy of requiring proof of surgical treatmentwas challenged on the basis that it violated the city's Administrative Procedure Act,was an arbitrary and capricious agency action, and was a violation of numerousprovisions of the New York City Human Rights Law.

Some may favor a self-identity based policy. See, e.g., TRANSGENDER EQUAL. NET-WORK IR., A TIME FOR RECOGNITION: RESPECT, RECOGNITION AND EQUALITYFOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE 9, available at http://www.teni.ie/attachments/714a4ffb-3240-496b-8905-06002a24d6c7.pdf (\"TENI would propose that a statu-tory declaration rather than an affidavit would be appropriate for gender recognitionand that the person swear that they have given the matter careful consideration anddeclare their wish to change their gender and have this recognized legally.\"). In Ar-gentina, a self-identity based policy, with no external verification, is now nationallaw. See supra notes 38-40 and accompanying text. Yet, given the lack of even anyU.S. driver's license policies, seen as less legally meaningful, being based entirely onself-identity with no external verification, it seems unlikely that a jurisdiction would2013] 425MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER d& LAWtion is necessary. However, it can be done without obstructing a person'sconstitutional rights and can be done in a way that comports with contem-porary medical understanding.Although the complete model law is presented in Part V.,210 the rele-vant portion regarding the standard of proof is the following:A notarized statement from the registrant's licensed treating orevaluating physician or health care provider stating that the reg-istrant has undergone surgical, hormonal, or other treatment appro-priate for that individual for the purpose ofgender transition, basedon contemporary medical standards, or stating that the registranthas an intersex condition, and that in the provider's professionalopinion the registrant's gender designation should be changedaccordingly.There are seven important features to this model language:(1) First, the language uses the term \"licensed physician orhealth care provider\" because, as the Standards of Care rec-ognize, a number of physicians and non-physician healthcare providers can be appropriately involved in a person'sgender transition and have the requisite knowledge to makea competent evaluation. This language is broad enough toinclude therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social work-ers, as well as other physicians who are licensed to providehealth care.(2) Second, there is no requirement that the provider personallyconducted or supervised the person's treatment-a provideragree to a solely self-identity based policy for birth certificates. In addition, there aresome that want gender removed entirely from the birth certificate. See Spade, supranote 4, at 805-08. This is more feasible than one might think because the govern-ment health statisticians who want gender data can get it on the more detailed healthquestionnaire that is filled out at the same time with the birth certificate. For exam-ple, the health questionnaire typically asks race, whether or not pre-natal care wasreceived, and the health of the baby as delivered. While I am sympathetic to this wayof thinking, at this point it is not politically realistic to suggest to state legislatures toremove gender entirely. Also, as discussed in supra Part I.D.2., there are importantpractical and legal reasons that a person may need to have some official record ofgender to present to authorities. A gender-less birth certificate cannot meet thatneed.210. See infra Part V.426 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESwho has completed an evaluation should be consideredqualified.211(3) Third, the language uses the phrase \"has undergone\" as op-posed to \"complete,\" which is sometimes found in existingstatutes and implies that the treatment has ended.(4) Fourth, the language is clear that it is an individual standardand no specific medical treatment is required. This is due tothe use of the conjunctive in \"surgical, hormonal, or othertreatment\" as well as the important phrase \"appropriate forthat individual.\"(5) Fifth, the reference to \"contemporary medical standards\" inthe statute is included to help ensure that as medicineevolves, so does the statute. 2 12(6) Sixth, the language ensures that providers are exercising theirprofessional judgment, based on the treatment they pro-vided or based on their evaluation, with the phrase \"in theprovider's professional opinion.\"(7) Seventh, the language has an alternative standard for thosewith intersex conditions so that they do not have to demon-strate treatment of gender transition. For people with inter-sex conditions, it is sufficient to only require that theirprovider deem it appropriate for the gender marker on theirbirth certificate to be corrected.213Ill. DEVELOPING AN ACCESSIBLE AND EFFICIENT PROCEDURE FORGENDER MARKER CORRECTIONSThe procedure for correcting gender markers on birth certificates mustbe examined in light of two primary goals. First, the process for gender211. This is in large part about convenience and practicality. Some people receive treat-ment from doctors in other countries. Also, occasionally, the specific provider whotreated a person retires, dies, or is otherwise not easily locatable. Thus, any doctorwho can evaluate the person should be eligible to provide the information about theperson s treatment.212. The inclusion of this \"contemporary medical standards\" phrase should also help leg-islators support the measure because they know that what they are endorsing is sup-ported by modern medicine, which otherwise may not be obvious.213. This is similar to the U.S. Department of State policy related to Consular Reports ofBirth Abroad and Passports, which requires only the provider review the gender-related history of the applicant to determine which gender marker should be male orfemale. U.S. Dep't of St., 7 FOREIGN AFFAIRS MANUAL 1300, App. M, IntersexConditions (2011) available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/143160.pdf.2013] 427MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWcorrection should be as accessible as possible so that transgender people whowarrant the correction can access it, regardless of their income or other per-sonal factors. Relevant to this inquiry is primarily whether a court orderprocess is used or whether a person can go directly to the agency with aprovider's statement. Second, the process should be as efficient as possible toconserve government resources.A. Existing Laws and Policies Related to ProcessWhile the MSVSA requires a court order, only twenty-two states, theCommonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, District of Columbia, andU.S. Virgin Islands require court orders.214 In nineteen states, New YorkCity, and Guam, a doctor's affidavit or other documentation submitted di-rectly to the vital statistics agency is sufficient evidence of a gender transi-tion. 215 Three states allow a person to use either process. 216 Procedures areunclear in several other jurisdictions.217One of the consequences of using a court order system, especiallywhen the statutory standard is nonexistent or vague, is that individualjudges are likely to establish or apply their own standards of eligibility for agender correction based on their individual knowledge. Even if the word\"surgery\" is used in the statute, some judges may distinguish between thetypes of surgery they deem would make a petitioner eligible for the correc-tion. This problem is exacerbated in states where people are required to goto court in their county of birth or residence, and thus are not able to go toan area of the state where judges might be more familiar with, and lessbiased against, transgender people and gender transition. 2 18 Similarly, if214. The states are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia,Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, NewHampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyo-ming. See infra app. A215. The nineteen states are Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Kan-sas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, North Dakota,Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington. Seeinfra app. A.216. These are Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. See infa app. A.217. These are Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and American Samoa. See infa app. A.218. For example, in Vermont, people have to go to the probate judge in their county ofbirth. VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 18, § 5075 (West 2011). Each county has one electedprobate judge. Although Vermont's probate judicial system is relatively easy to accessand can be utilized without an attorney, this system remains highly restrictive be-cause it increases the potential for someone having to appeal (and hire an attorney) ifthe elected judge in the county of birth denies the correction. Anecdotally, we knowthat the ability to go to certain judges or to the courts in a large geographic area,where most judges are more educated about and less biased toward transgender peo-ple, is an important survival technique. A system that forces a person to go to a428 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESjudges are attempting to determine what treatment is \"appropriate\" for theindividual, one can imagine that different judges will come to differentconclusions.In an attempt to mitigate the problems of judicial inexpertise, bothCalifornia2 19 and Vermont adopted statutory language to limit judges' abil-ity to determine what qualifies as appropriate medical treatment. In Ver-mont, the statute says that the documentation from the medical provider is\"sufficient evidence,\"220 and in California, the documentation should beconsidered \"conclusive proof\" of the change in gender.221 Furthermore, inCalifornia, the gender change process is already facilitated by a series ofcourt-created, consumer-friendly forms that reduce the need for anattorney.222In the twenty-four states without requirements for a court order, typi-cally a doctor's statement (nine states), certificate (two states), letter (twostates), or affidavit (nine states) must be provided directly to the vital statis-tics agency. Two jurisdictions require that the documentation be \"sworn\"223and seven require that the documentation be notarized.224 Nine states re-quire that the physician signing the letter or statement is the actual surgeonwho performed the surgery.225 Two states have more burdensome require-specific judge or area of the state makes it more likely a person will be unable to steeraway from discrimination. Interview with Kristina Wertz, supra note 114 (notingvariation on outcome based on judge when California had a surgical requirement).219. The new law could still be improved by eliminating the requirement of receiving acourt order entirely. Conversations with transgender advocates in California indicatethat they decided to address primarily the surgical requirement with this legislation.Additional, they have already attempted to minimize the burden of needing to go tocourt by creating a combined process for name and gender corrections and easy-to-use forms.

However, the strength of the\"conclusive proof' statement is somewhat tempered by a later statement that \"[a]tthe conclusion of the hearing the court shall grant the petition if the court deter-mines that the physician's affidavit shows that the person has undergone clinicallyappropriate treatment for the purpose of gender transition.\" Id.222.

Requiringonly a letter or notarized statement, as opposed to an \"affidavit,\" should beeasier for a non-lawyer to understand how to produce.228 In addition, boththe Consular Reports of Birth Abroad policy and the new California statuteprovide suggested language for the medical provider to include in a letter orstatement. This also can be helpful for a non-lawyer to navigate the system.Another important feature, which currently only exists in Connecti-cut, is a provision relating to the jurisdiction of judges to issue court ordersto correct a current resident's gender on his/her birth certificate when theywere born in a different state that requires a court order. Because of thetime, money, travel, and other costs associated with traveling to the place ofbirth to hire an attorney and appear in court, it is significantly easier forindividuals to file for a court order from their current state of residence.Connecticut's statute provides:In the case of a person who is a resident of this state and wasborn in another state or in a foreign jurisdiction, if such otherstate or foreign jurisdiction requires a court decree in order toamend a birth certificate to reflect a change in gender, the pro-bate courts in this state shall have jurisdiction to issue such adecree.229226. For New York, this involves \"a letter from the surgeon specifying date, place, andtype of sex reassignment surgery performed; an operative report from the sex reas-signment surgery; and some additional medical documentation.\" For Virginia, theapplicant needs a \"preoperative diagnosis, postoperative diagnosis and description ofprocedure.\" See infra app. A.227.

Issues to Consider When Designing a Correction ProcessApproximately half of jurisdictions currently have a court order pro-cess instead of a direct-to-agency process. These jurisdictions need to con-sider the various consequences of this policy. For many, the court orderprocess can be an insurmountable practical or financial barrier to obtain acorrected birth certificate. It also compromises privacy, leads to problemscaused by lack of judicial inexpertise and bias, as well as raises serious consti-tutional questions.1. Practical Concerns with the Court Order ProcessAdministrative processes are a critical feature of government recordkeeping and daily life. The government keeps records on our lives in manyways. If people had to hire attorneys or visit judges for all of the governmentrecord-keeping features of their lives, the cost of running the governmentwould exponentially increase. Imagine if everyone had to hire an attorneyand go to court for every interaction they had with the government, such ashaving a child and needing to establish a birth record, getting a driver'slicense, registering the ownership of a car, getting married, recording adeath, etc. Because of their easy accessibility, efficiency, and lower cost, ad-ministrative processes are often used in lieu of judicial action for record-keeping functions. The judicial process is utilized when there is a need forjudicial oversight to prevent fraud or for an investigation where facts arecontested.Requiring people to get court orders to correct the gender markers ontheir birth certificates is typically a significant burden. There are many ex-penses associated with it: hiring an attorney competent in the matter, takingtime off work or school to meet with an attorney and appear in court,traveling to the courtroom and attorney's office (the cost of which, espe-cially for non-residents of the state, may be significant and time consum-230. In re Heilig, 816 A.2d 68, 84 (Md. 2003) (noting that a lower court in Marylandhad held that it did not have power over the Secretary of State of Pennsylvania toorder a change in the individual's birth certificate and, in dicta, stating \"[o]bviously,the Legislature cannot direct officials in other States to change birth certificates is-sued in those States but may deal only with birth certificates issued or issuable inMaryland . . . \").231. Of course, the receptive state or country may not accept the order, but many statesare known to do so as a practical matter.4312013]MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWing), and court fees. Although court forms may be created to simplify theprocess somewhat and court fee waivers may be available to those with lowincomes, in general, a court order process is significantly more burdensomethan an administrative process.Thus, to reduce costs to both the government and the individual,states should provide an administrative process for birth certificate gendercorrections.2. Privacy Concerns with the Court Order ProcessThere is no public policy reason to require a person to discuss theirintimate feelings regarding their birth sex, gender identity, or the medicaltreatments they have received in open court. Privacy of the details of one'ssex, gender identity, and medical treatment, or the facts surrounding one'sgender transition or transgender status, should not depend on the happen-stance of who is in the courtroom 232 or whether the judge agrees to seal orredact the judicial records.Furthermore, depending on the system, the very instigation of thecourt proceeding can create permanent court records that document theproceeding in some way regardless of attempted confidentiality.233 The fu-ture availability of court records to members of the public can also causepsychological distress.As will be discussed fully in Part IV-B, the mere disclosure of a per-son's transgender status, or his or her medical treatment related to beingtransgender, is likely to be a constitutional privacy violation. One effective232. This concern may be mitigated in systems in which the person only appears beforethe judge, not in open court. However, at the minimum, the judge and potentially aclerk will be listening to these intimate details. In a direct-to-agency procedure, lessprivate and intimate details are disclosed by the medical provider's statement, andthere may be only one person who examines the provider's statement. In California,the Transgender Law Center has recommended to people worried about disclosuresin open court that they ask to go last or ask to speak with the judge in closed court ifquestions come up that they would prefer not to answer in open court. TRANS-GENDER LAW CENTER, ID PLEASE.. . 9-22, 31-32 (2010) available at http://trans-genderlawcenter.org/issues/id/id-please.233. This concern may be mitigated if the record is sealed by the judge, which, dependingon the system, may only be allowed at the judge's discretion. However, in somestates even a sealed record will be available in the court index. See, e.g. LEGAL VOICE,Family LAW COURT RECORDS AND YOUR PRIVACY 5 (2008) available at http://www.legalvoice.org/pdf/self-help/Family-LawCourtRecords-_%20andYour_Privacy.pdf (\"When the court seals a file or a document, the court means to protectit from examination by the public. The existence of the sealed file can be found on acourt index with the case number and the names of the parties and the notation 'casesealed'. However, the contents of the case will not be available to the public.\").432 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESway to deal with this potential privacy violation is to avoid it by not goingthrough the court system in the first place.2343. Concerns about Lack of Judicial Education and Bias Toward SurgeryJudges are often called upon to make a factual determination withregard to medical facts, including in the most complicated cases of medicalmalpractice, and they do so competently. However, to do so, they rely inlarge part on medical and scientific experts. When it comes to transgendermedicine, judges' views may be similar to those of the general public. Ab-sent testimony from medical experts, judges may not be aware of the cur-rent well-accepted Standards of Care or how inaccessible surgical treatmentcan be. There is a greater risk that a judge will misapply the standard \"ap-propriate treatment . . . based on contemporary medical standards\" thanthere is In having a medical professional apply the standard.That judges are not fully educated on transgender medical issues hasbeen documented in other areas of the law. Judges often have required sur-gery as a condition for gender recognition, especially in cases related to mar-riage, even when there is no medical or legal basis for that requirement. 235Moreover, certain judges have required proof of surgery for name changesfor transgender people, which according to longstanding common law prin-ciples are to be granted except in the narrowest circumstances. The fact thatmany judges have applied a surgical standard where none exists indicatesthat many share the belief that anatomical presentation is what determinesgender. Battles over proof of surgery in the name change context have bub-bled up to appellate courts in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York,2 36234. Another alternative would be to require in the statute that the court proceeding beconducted in private and to be sealed afterwards. This lessens some of the confiden-tiality concerns but does not entirely eradicate them.235. See Tobin, Against the Surgical Requirement, supra note 4, at 413-17.236. Longstanding common law principles establish a person's right to change theirname, with an affirmative right to do so absent harm to another person, fraud, orother public policy interest. Judges may consider whether the name would createother fraudulent issues, such as someone adopting the name of a well-respected pro-fessional in order to get business fraudulently, whether or not the name is overly longor ridiculous, or profane. In re Falcucci, 50 A.2d 200, 202-03 (Pa. 1947). Somejudges in New York required documentation of sex reassignment surgery beforegranting a simple name change from a traditionally male name to a female name.This happened throughout New York until a series of appellate decisions appear tohave definitively declared that proof of medical treatment was not required. In reWinn-Ritzenberg, 891 N.Y.S.2d 220, 221 (N.Y. App. Term 2009) (per curiam)(\"There is no sound basis in law or policy to engraft upon the statutory provisions anadditional requirement that a transgendered-petitioner present medical substantia-tion for the desired name change.\"); see also In re Guido, 771 N.Y.S.2d 789 (N.Y.Civ. Ct. 2003) (reversing the court's own decision after initially requiring medical2013] 433MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER d+ LAWand include a case where a judge denied a transgender woman a namechange from \"Brian\" to \"Lisa\" who had been living as Lisa for 22 years. 2 37In other areas of the country, denials of name changes based on lack ofmedical evidence still happen on a regular basis.238 That this continues to bea problem, despite clear case law that surgery should not be required, dem-onstrates the persistence of the judges' views that surgery is properly re-quired before recognizing a person's gender.In order to remedy a judge's possible lack of education about trans-gender medicine, an applicant would potentially need to hire a medical ex-pert, or experts, to provide this expertise to the judge.239 This is a costlyburden. In the alternative, the judge could defer to the physician who pro-vides a statement that the person in question has undergone appropriatemedical treatment, in the way suggested by California and Vermont's stat-utes. In that scenario, the judge is not performing any fact-finding beyonddetermining that the physician is a real person who signed the paper. Therole that judges play in these places could be filled as competently, or morecompetently, by an official in the vital records office who regularly inspectsdocuments for authenticity.It is helpful to analogize this situation to one where a person withepilepsy had to obtain a court order to drive. Certainly a judge is capable ofdetermining that the person has been adequately medicated by examiningthe testimony of experts or that person's doctor. However, a more efficientsystem is one that allows the DMV to process the provided medical infor-evidence). Appellate courts in Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also overruled lowerjudges on this question. See In re McIntylre, 715 A.2d 400, 402-03 (Pa. 1998)(\"Here, it was undisputed that Appellant was judgment free and was not seeking aname change to avoid any financial obligations or commit fraud. The fact that he isa transsexual seeking a feminine name should not affect the disposition of his re-quest.\"); In re Eck, 584 A.2d 859, 860-61 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1991) (\"Ab-sent fraud or other improper purpose a person has a right to a name change whetherhe or she has undergone or intends to undergo a sex change through surgery, hasreceived hormonal injections to induce physical change, is a transvestite, or simplywants to change from a traditional \"male\" first name to one traditionally \"female,\"or vice versa.\").237. In re Harris, 707 A.2d 225 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1997).238. Interview with Dru Levasseur, supra note 115.239. The highest court in Maryland appeared to realize its limitations in knowledge oftransgender medical issues in In re Heilig, 816 A.2d 68, 72 (Md. 2003). The courtasserted it is not qualified to write a medical text on the subject of transgendermedicine and noting that it is unable to evaluate that field \"unguided by experttestimony.\" Id. Despite this statement, the court then wrote ten pages summarizingmedical research into transsexualism and intersex conditions, presumably showingwillingness to venture into areas of scientific knowledge despite being unguided byexpert testimony. Id. at 71-79.434 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESmation; in fact, this is generally how this issue is handled.240 It is Simplyinefficient-a waste of judicial resources-and prone to error to have ajudge make or supervise the medical determination instead of a person'sdoctor.4. Constitutional Problems with a Court Order ProcessThere is a novel argument that requiring a court order is a substantial,and therefore invalid, burden upon a person's right to determine his or hergender. First, the court would need to recognize that there is a right to self-determination of gender, discussed previously in Section II.B.5.Once the right is established, the burden of going to court must beanalyzed. Certainly, as previously discussed, the process of getting a courtorder typically requires money for court fees, hiring an attorney, time toprcpare for and make a court appearance, and potentially travel to one'sstate or county of birth. Furthermore, it may compromise the privacy ofone's transgender or medical status. Thus, going through the court processis legitimately considered a real burden for those attempting to update thegender on their birth certificate. If the burden is considered significant orsubstantial,24 1 the court order process is unconstitutional, unless it is justi-fied by sufficiently important government interests and closely tailored tomeet them.242C. Specific Recommendation for the Gender Correction ProcessIn order to maximize both the accessibility of the gender markerchange and the efficiency of the government in making the change, an ad-ministrative process in which an individual goes directly to the agency withthe relevant documentation should be the standard method for gender240. DMVs have slightly different rules on how to determine when a person with epilepsyshould be cleared to drive, but none of the states have any judicial involvement. SeeRobert S. Fisher, Driving and Epilepsy, EPILEPSY THERAPY PROJECT, (Mar. 2009)http://www.epilepsy.com/epilepsy/newsletter/mar09_driving.241. See Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978).242. See Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 388 (\"When a statutory classification significantly inter-feres with the exercise of a fundamental right, it cannot be upheld unless it is sup-ported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuateonly those interests.\"); See also Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 144 (1972) (findingthat a law infringing on a constitutional right \"must be 'closely scrutinized' andfound reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of legitimate state objectives inorder to pass constitutional muster\"). I plan to explore this argument further in afuture article.4352013]MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWmarker corrections on birth certificates.243 A notarized statement from adoctor, with the relevant information, should be sufficient documentationto ensure that the applicant has a bona fide need for a corrected gendermarker. Using the term \"notarized statement\" is more desirable than \"affi-davit\" because the general public is more aware of how to get a statementnotarized than how to write an affidavit, the format of which may be highlytechnical and differs from state-to-state.In the case of bias or misapplication of the relevant standard by theagency official, the statute should make clear that there is an appeals processthrough the courts that an individual may pursue if denied a gender markercorrection. The MSVSA has such language relating to all potential correc-tions, and a number of states have also adopted it.2 44In addition, the statute should give courts of that state clear authorityto provide court orders that residents can use in their state or country ofbirth where court orders are still required. This is relatively straightforwardand should be included as a matter of course until there are no longer statesor countries that require court orders. If this provision is not included,judges may be concerned that they lack authority to issue such an order.245243. My proposed statute dictates that the administrative process is the only process. Injoint recommendations to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,organizations have recommended that the statute allow that an individual can eithersubmit a court order to the agency or submit a statement from the physician. SeeHarper Jean Tobin, Nat'1 Cr. for Transgender Equality, Comments of Legal andPublic Policy Organizations on Corrected Birth Certificates for Transgender People(Sept. 8, 2009) (on file with author). I have omitted the court order option from thisproposed statute in large part to avoid suggesting that states should choose whichoption to include in their statute. In reality, including both court order and adminis-trative processes as options for an individual to use in the state's statute or policy, isalso an acceptable outcome. In that case, a person who finds that the court orderprocess is a burden can use the administrative process. The benefit of also includinga court order option is that people who need a court order declaring their legalgender for other reasons may potentially be able to avoid the difficulties of acquiringstatements from their health provider.244.

ESTABLISHING COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY PROTECTIONSThe state may be violating an individual's right to privacy if it revealsinformation regarding a person's gender assigned at birth, gender transition,or transgender status. In creating a policy related to privacy, policymakersshould consider the impact of government disclosure on transgender peopleas well as constitutional privacy rights that may be implicated.The transgender person's right to privacy can be implicated by a birthcertificate policy in three ways. First, if the agency refuses to provide a trans-gender person an updated gender marker, then the individual is \"outed\" astransgender to all who inspect the certificate. Second, in the process of pur-suing and executing the gender correction, there are records created andaltered that may leave a publicly available paper trail, including a visiblyamended birth certificate. Here, how the gender marker correction is dealtwith is only part of the issue, since policies related to how a change of nameis recorded also matter. Third, the government staff involved in the processmay learn of and disclose a person's transgender status to others. This Sec-tion deals primarily with the latter two issues-i.e. how to avoid privacyviolations in the process and recording of gender correction as well as therole that government officials play. The first was fully addressed by recom-mendations in Sections II and III.A. Existing Privacy Protections1. Privacy Protections in the MSVSAa. New Versus Amended CertificatesThe MSVSA provides a general rule for any kind of amendment: itshould be shown on the face of the document unless otherwise provided forby regulation.24 6 Thus, unless a state adopts a regulation setting forth adifferent policy, the fact that an amendment has been made will be plain onthe face of the certificate in some way.The Model Regulations that accompany the MSVSA list the variousways in which a birth certificate can be amended so that the amendment, orthe fact that an item was amended, is visible (or not) to those who inspectit: (1) by preparing a new certificate with a note that the item number wasamended and on what date; (2) by drawing a single line through the incor-rect information (without obliterating the underlying entry) and writing the246. \"A certificate or report that is amended under this section shall indicate that it hasbeen amended, except as otherwise provided in this section or by regulation.\"MODEL STATE VITAL STATISTICs ACT § 21(e) (Ctr. for Disease Control & Preven-tion 1992).4372013]MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER d&LAWcorrect data above or to the side; (3) by creating a special amendment formthat includes the correct information and is attached to the original, unal-tered certificate; and, (4) for electronic records, by changing the item, not-ing the date, and retaining the original information. The MSVSA ModelRegulation provides these in brackets, indicating that they are all \"op-tional,\"247 with the implication that states choose the provision(s) that theyprefer. At the end of the list of options, there is a provision that specificallyapplies to gender correction, which is indicated through cross-referencingSection 21(d), the gender correction provision:(f) A certificate of birth amended pursuant to the provisions of(Section 21(d) of the Model Act) shall be amended by preparinga new certificate. The item numbers of the entries that wereamended shall not, however, be identified on the new certificate oron any certified copies that may be issued of that certificate.24 8Thus, the MSVSA Model Regulations treat gender correction as anamendment that should be kept private from those who are permitted toinspect the certificate. However, the provision could go unnoticed as anoption to be used, or alternatively, policymakers could assume that it is oneoption of many when viewed in conjunction with the other options listed inthis section. This is compounded by the fact that this optional provision'sapplication to gender markers was only indicated through cross-referencing.In fact, presumably because of the lack of clarity caused by the cross-referencing used in subsection (f), or otherwise lack of attention to detail bystate policymakers, some states have adopted the MSVSA statutory languagerelated to gender corrections without adopting the accompanying regulationin (f). Of course, some states may have also intentionally not adopted theprovision because they wanted gender marker corrections to be visible. Yet,remarkably, some jurisdictions (such as Alabama, the Commonwealth of theNorthern Mariana Islands, Kentucky, and Oregon)249 have the exactMSVSA language that directs gender on one's birth certificate to be\"amended as provided by regulation\" but do not have any regulation in-structing how amendments are to be made. Thus, in many states followingpart of the MSVSA, gender corrections are processed and marked asamended in the same way that other amendments are processed andmarked, whether through a single-line cross out or another method.247. \"In cases where recommendations were considered optional, brackets, '[],' have beenplaced around the word or phrase.\" Id. at 1.248. Id. at §11.8(0 (emphasis added).249. For citations of these statutes, see infra app. A.438 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESb. Treatment of Name Changes in the MSVSAHow a policy treats name changes is an important part of privacyanalysis since the revelation of a name change has the potential to disclosethat someone is transgender, even if the gender marker correction is keptprivate. The MSVSA requires a court-ordered name change to amend aname on the birth certificate. 250 Except in cases of adoption, or for namechanges before the age of one, names will be amended visibly on the face ofthe document itself, following whichever amendment process the statechooses.251However, the MSVSA's gender correction provision, Section 21(d),also refers to name changes that occur due to a change in gender. Accord-ingly, the fact and details of a transgender person's name change presumablyshould remain confidential on the certificate if the MSVSA Model Regula-tion's provision related to privacy is adopted. 252 However, the MSVSA's lackof clarity on this point renders it insufficient to ensure adequate privacyprotections.c. Records Storage and Accessibility in the MSVSAThe MSVSA generally limits access to copies of birth certificates toregistrants; the registrant's spouses, children, parents or guardians; the legalrepresentatives of any of them; or a person who is able to show that thecertificate is necessary to determine or protect a property interest.253250. \"Upon receipt of a certified copy of an order of (a court of competent jurisdiction)changing the name of a person born in this State and upon request of such person orhis or her parents, guardian, or legal representative, the State Registrar shall amendthe certificate of birth to show the new name.\" MODEL VITAL STATISTICs ACT,supra note 1, § 21(c), at 10.251. The Model State Vital Statistics Act's Regulations list possible options states couldchoose. Id. at §11.8.252. Id. at Reg. 11.8(f (\"A certificate of birth amended pursuant to the provisions of(Section 21(d) of the Model Act) shall be amended by preparing a new certificate.The item numbers of the entries that were amended shall not, however, be identifiedon the new certificate or on any certified copies that may be issued of thatcertificate.\").253. Id. at § 24 (a) (\"The State Registrar [and other custodian(s) of vital records author-ized by the State Registrar to issue certified copies] shall, upon receipt of an applica-tion, issue a certified copy of a vital record in his or her custody or a part thereof tothe registrant, his or her spouse, children, parents, or guardian, or their respective author-ized representative. Others may be authorized to obtain certified copies when they demon-strate that the record is needed for the determination or protection ofhis or her personal orproperty right. The State Agency may adopt regulations to further define those whomay obtain copies of vital records filed under this Act.\") (emphasis added).4392013]MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER &LAWThe MSVSA also ensures that the documents used to justify anamendment, including the correction of gender or name, must be kept bythe vital statistics agency:A record shall be maintained which identifies the evidence uponwhich the amendment was based, the date of the amendment,and the identity of the person making the amendment. 254There is some ambiguity with regard to the documentation that mustbe preserved. It could be argued that, at a minimum, the official must makea note identifying the type of documentation received (physician's letter,court order, etc.). However, this language may also be read to mean that thedocuments themselves must be preserved as well.Whether these records are sealed or available to those authorized toreceive a copy of the certificate is not clear because the topic is not explicitlyaddressed by the MSVSA or Model Regulation. If a state also adopts theModel Regulation provision related to privacy, 255 which states that individu-als requesting a copy of a birth certificate should only be given the new birthcertificate, then that state has at least demonstrated evidence of the intent toprotect privacy in the context of gender corrections. Potentially, then, all ofthe retained records should be kept confidential as well.2562. State Laws and Policies Related to PrivacyOf the fifty-three jurisdictions that allow gender marker corrections todocumentation, seventeen states, 257 the District of Columbia, and Guamhave procedures that allow for amending the original birth certificate but do254. Id. at Reg. 21(b).255.

Most states have a policy similar to the MSVSA, which re-stricts access to immediate family members, their legal representatives, andthose that have a proven property interest. 264 However, at least ten statesallow either certified or informational copies of birth certificates to be pro-vided to members of the public.2 65258.

Although other features of Nebraska's policy are in need of up-dating, the privacy protections are comprehensive.266 The statute states that:[T]he department shall prepare a new certificate of birth in thenew name and sex of such person in substantially the same formas that used for other live births. The evidence from which thenew certificate is prepared and the original certificate of birthshall be available for inspection only upon the order of a court ofcompetent jurisdiction. 2 67There are three important features of this policy. First, a new, notamended, certificate is prepared. Second, only the new certificate, not theformer one, is available for viewing. Third, the documentation that the reg-istrant provided, as well as the old certificate, are both confidential and onlyavailable by a court order.

Issues to Consider When Developing Privacy Policies1. The Individual Importance of PrivacyGiven the risk of violence and discrimination that comes with beingknown as transgender, it is understandable that some people desire to keepinformation about their transgender status limited to only those whom theychoose to tell. Of course not all transgender people want to be \"closeted\" allof the time, but generally, people do want to have control over how theypresent and manage information related to being transgender. Even if therisk of violence is not present, being able to decide with whom and when tohave a \"coming out\" conversation should be a matter of individual choice.The harms discussed above from having an incorrect gender marker can alsoresult from being \"outed\" by an insufficiently private procedure for cor-recting gender. The person whose gender transition is revealed may be sub-ject to increased scrutiny because of the possibility of fraudulent documents,often being subjected to questioning about his or her body and identity.2782. Constitutional Right to PrivacyIf a governmental entity does not protect the privacy of a transgenderperson and reveals his or her status-either through issuing visibly amendedbirth certificates or by providing access to records that indicate a person istransgender-it may be in violation of the right to privacy guaranteed bythe U.S. Constitution. 27 9 Whether the U.S. Supreme Court has officiallyrecognized a constitutionally derived right to privacy that guarantees peopleto be free of governmental \"disclosure of personal matters\" is not entirely276. Regime for Recognition and Respect for Gender Identity (File 8126-D-2010) (Ar-gentina), available at http://wwwl.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&numexp=8126-D-2010. (An English translation is available at http://www.msmgf.org/files/msmgf//Advocacy/ArgentinaGenderldentityLaw.pdf).277. Gender Recognition Act, 2004, c. 7 § 10 sch. 3 (U.K.).278. Spade, supra note 4, at 738.279. This right to privacy should not be confused with the other well-established right toprivacy, generally understood as the right to make decisions about intimate details ofone's life. \"[T]his right to privacy can be characterized as a right to 'confidentiality,'to distinguish it from the right to autonomy and independence in decision-makingfor personal matters.\" Doe v. City of New York, 15 F.3d 264, 267 (2d Cir. 1994).444 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESclear.280 While the Court has considered the issue, and has \"assumed with-out deciding\" that such a right exists, it has only done so in limited contextsthat are not directly applicable to privacy claims related to birth certificaterecords.281However, while the Supreme Court has not yet definitively ruled onthe existence of this privacy right and certainly has not made a decisionregarding disclosure of transgender status by a government actor, the Sec-ond Circuit has done so. In Powell v. Shriver,28 2 the Court of Appeals heldthat the constitutional right to privacy protects transgender people fromunnecessary government disclosure of their transgender status.2 83 The appel-late court concluded that, \"[t]he excruciatingly private and intimate natureof transsexualism, for persons who wish to preserve privacy in the matter, isreally beyond debate.\"284Thus, the only court to rule on this question has decided that thereclearly is a privacy right to protect information regarding transgender status,and other judges have cited this decision with approval. 285 In addition, al-though less dispositive on a federal constitutional right to privacy claim, ajudge in Alaska determined it was a violation of a transgender person's rightto privacy under the Alaska Constitution to not be able to update the gen-der on one's driver's license.286 Accordingly, policymakers should recognize280. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599 (1976) (describing one type of privacy protectionapparently protected by the Constitution as \"the individual interest in avoiding dis-closure of personal matters\").281. In a recent case, the Court assumed that there was such a privacy right. NASA v.Nelson, 131 S. Ct. 746, 751 (2011) (\"We assume, without deciding, that the Con-stitution protects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in Whalen and Nixon.\"); seealso Whalen, 429 U.S. 589 (1976) (relating to a state statutory scheme mandatingconfidential reporting of prescriptions of certain controlled substances to the statedepartment of health, which was monitoring for fraud and abuse); Nixon v.

The original birth certificateand the documents related to the gender marker correction should be availa-ble to the individual because the person may need to establish continuousidentity.288The statute should provide privacy protections for related namechanges, regardless of whether the name change is acquired simultaneously,before, or after the gender correction. If the agency's policy is to make visi-ble amendments for name changes, an exception should be made for namechanges related to gender corrections. Thus, although a change of name thatprecedes a gender correction will be visible, at the time of gender correction,the name change should become confidential. Similarly, a gender-relatedname change occurring after the gender correction should also be madeconfidential. The statute needs to explicitly discuss each of these situationsso the determination is made correctly regardless of timing.The statute should also prohibit further inquiry into medical informa-tion. To respect the individual's medical privacy, staff should not either offi-cially or casually ask the applicant for additional medical or otherinformation beyond what is required by the statute. In addition to protect-ing privacy concerns, this also streamlines the administrative process andensures that staff will treat applicants respectfully and consistently with howother applicants for documentation corrections are treated. Furthermore,any information received about a gender correction should be kept confi-dential, unless disclosure is necessary in the course of conducting officialbusiness.287. Spade, supra note 4, at 770 (discussing the importance of having a \"clean\" birthcertificate).288. Name change orders may also be helpful to show continuous identity, but not every-one changes names or has those records easily available. Where exactly one mightneed the original copy of one's birth certificate is not entirely clear, but it doesappear to be in rare situations where multiple forms of proof are required. For exam-ple, a bank may request multiple forms of identification from a customer who seeksto use his or her funds, to ensure that the person is the same customer with adifferent name. Interview with Alison Gill, D.C. Trans Coalition, in Washington,D.C. (Confirmed Oct. 12, 2012).446 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESLastly, the statute should ensure that those who hold an amendedcertificate that was acquired before the new statute came into effect are ableto receive a new certificate with the same privacy protections (i.e. sealing ofthe original certificate and the associated documents from public inspec-tion). In states that have had a policy of issuing \"amended\" certificates and/or not sealing the records related to correction of gender in the past, thisprovision is necessary to afford these individuals the same privacy protec-tions that are afforded to individuals who process their gender correctionunder the new statute. Thus, upon application and payment of appropriatefees,289 a person who previously received an amended certificate should beable to receive a new certificate.Ideally, the vital statistics agency should go through old records andseal those related to all of the previously executed gender corrections as well,regardless of whether the person has asked for sealing of records; however, asa practical matter, this may not be feasible. Therefore, at the minimum, thesealing of old records related to gender correction should be completed atthe request of the applicant.V. RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE AND POLICYA. The Model ProvisionThis Section proposes new language that should be easy to insert intoany vital statistics code to comprehensively address gender marker correc-tions. 290 For the new version of the MSVSA, this would be its own sectionand Section 21(d) would need to be deleted. This model statutory provisionincorporates all of the features needed in a statute to have a clear, compre-hensive policy with regard to gender corrections and associated namechanges. It would be based on current medical consensus, sound policy con-siderations, and in compliance with applicable constitutional requirements.This model language is based on, and borrows heavily from, the statutorylanguage in Vermont and California, as well as the policy of both Washing-ton and the U.S. Department of State relating to Consular Reports of BirthAbroad.Although it is drafted in the style of statutory language, this languagecan instead be adopted by the vital statistics agency, in whole or in part, asregulations or as written policy. This would be most applicable in jurisdic-289. Throughout this article, no recommendation is made with regard to the appropriateamount of fees. As guidance, fees should not be prohibitively costly and should bewaivable, without significant delay, with a showing of indigence.290. Of course, any such legislation should delete the existing language related to gendercorrections, if it exists.4472013]MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWtions with no statute on the issue of gender correction or a gender correc-tion statute that would not conflict with such regulations. Here is therecommended text:Section X Changes to Birth Certificate Related to a Change of Gender(a) The State Registrar shall issue a new birth certificate to a person whowas born in [this state] and who has a gender different from the gender denotedon that person's birth certificate when the State Registrar receives:1) A written request by the registrant, his or her parents, guardian,or legal representative signed under penalty of law, that the StateRegistrar issue a birth certificate with a gender designation that dy-fers from the gender designated on the registrant's original birthcertificate;2) A notarized statement from the registrant's licensed treating orevaluating physician or health care provider stating that the regis-trant has undergone surgical, hormonal, or other treatment appro-priate for that individual for the purpose ofgender transition, basedon contemporary medical standards, or stating that the registrant hasan intersex condition, and that in the provider' professional opinionthe registrant's gender designation should be changed accordingly;and3) If the registrant or his or her legal representative is also requestinga name change on the certificate, an original or certified copy of aname change order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.(b) The State Registrar shall not request any additional information orrecords other than those required by subsection (a)(2). The State Registrar shallnot disclose information relating to a gender correction, including to other gov-ernment employees, unless required in order to conduct official business.(c) When the State Registrar receives the documentation described in sub-section (a) of this Section, the State Registrar shall issue a new birth certificatereflecting the new gender designation and, if applicable, new name of the regis-trant. The new birth certificate supersedes the original as the official publicrecord. The new certificate shall not be marked as amended and shall in no waydisclose the original information. When such a birth certificate is issued, theState Registrar shall cause the registrant's original birth certificate and all docu-mentation received pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section to be placed underseal and kept in a confidentialfile. The State Registrar shall provide access to the448 [Vol. 19:373MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESoriginal birth certificate and/or documentation received pursuant to subsection(a) of this Section only upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or writtenrequest of the registrant.(d) The State Registrar shall issue, upon request, a new birth certificatereflecting the new gender designation or new name (or as previously amended),and shall seal relevant records, as described in subsection (c) in these additionalcircumstances:(1) when a birth certificate is amended to reflect a change in gender des-ignation at any point in time after that birth certificate has been amended toreflect a name change(2) when a birth certificate is amended to reflect a name change at anypoint in time after the birth certificate has been amended to reflect a change ingender designation, or(3) if a person holds an amended birth certificate related to change ofgender and/or name issued under [a previous version of this Section].(e) The State Registrar shall not amend the vital record if (1) an appli-cant does not submit the minimum documentation required in this Section foramending a vital record; or (2) when the Registrar has reasonable cause to ques-tion the validity or adequacy of the applicants sworn statements or the docu-mentary evidence, and the deficiencies are not corrected. The State Registrarshall state in writing the reason for this action. Upon the State Registrar's refisalto amend the vital record, the applicant shall have a cause of action in court toamend the vital record. The Registrar shall give the applicant written notice ofthis right.() In the case of a person who is a resident of this state and was born inanother state or in a foreign jurisdiction, if such other state or foreign jurisdic-tion requires a court decree in order to amend a birth certificate to reflect achange in gender, the [courts/probate courts] in this state shall have jurisdictionto issue such a decree.Legislative drafters from a state considering adopting this languageshould also contemplate how these new provisions related to privacy andprocedures for gender marker corrections would affect the meaning of anyother existing provisions related to privacy or procedures for to other correc-tions.291 While subsequently amended or adopted statutes would not nor-291. For example, the precision and specificity in a new gender correction provision maycause a question about how an existing privacy provision regarding other correctionsor amendments should be interpreted. For example, if the adoption provision refersto records being \"confidential,\" and the gender correction provision refers to recordsbeing \"sealed,\" the agency or courts may think that different meaning was intended,when in actuality, the same meaning was likely intended. In this case, the adoptionprovision's language should also be changed to \"sealed\" to avoid this confusion.4492013]MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWmally be read to create confusion with prior provisions, the legislativedrafter ought to review carefully the structure and text of the entire existingstatute to avoid future confusion or unintended consequences from the po-tentially different wording introduced into the statute by this provision.Also, if not already clear from the existing statute, it should be made clearthat \"State Registrar\" refers to relevant staff of the vital records agency thathave been authorized by the Registrar to execute these corrections.B. ImplementationThis model statute was designed to avoid the need for additional clari-fication in the form of regulations or written policies. Eliminating vaguenessin statutory language increases the efficiency of the process by not requiringdeliberation and determination of what processes need to be established andfollowed by the state agency. However, there are also important implemen-tation items that would greatly increase the efficiency and success of the newstatute.First, it would streamline the process for staff, as well as the holder ofthe birth certificate, if there were a form promulgated by the vital statisticsagency for gender corrections. The use of forms for updating gender ondriver's licenses has become a best practice. 292 In what is considered themodel policy and has been adopted for use in several states, the Washington,D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles has a one-page form where the appli-cant fills out the top part (which requests the correction) and the medical orsocial service authority fills out and signs the bottom part (which indicatestheir professional opinion). 293 A similar form could be used by vital statisticsagencies.Second, providing staff with training for implementation is an essen-tial part of successfully effectuating any policy change. Staff training shouldinclude not only the policies and procedures to process the correction ofgender and/or name on birth certificates, but should also provide basic cul-tural competency so that transgender people interacting with staff aretreated respectfully throughout the process.Third, the practical instructions of how old records are removed fromthe files and new ones inserted, as well as how to seal the documents used inupdating gender may need to be developed. Furthermore, the issue ofwhether the agency has the ability to go back to previous gender correctionsand seal the records without a request by each individual needs to be ex-292.

Whether these privacy concerns will need to be dealt with by newregulations or written policy will depend on the state's existing policies andpractices. Accordingly, there could be a need to update existing regulationsor policies to ensure that confidentiality is maintained.CONCLUSIONLaws and policies related to birth certificates need to be updated tokeep up with advances in the medical, legal, and public policy fields. Byrecognizing the needs of its citizens, responding in a low-cost, efficient man-ner, and making policies based on careful legal and scientific analysis, thegovernment can improve transgender people's access to vital services andtake steps toward eliminating discrimination, harassment, and violence. Thestatute recommended by this Article results in four significant goals: 1) thatvital records will be accurate and in accord with contemporary medical stan-dards, 2) that government resources are used efficiently, 3) that constitu-tional rights are respected, and 4) that proper consideration was given to thehuman and legal impacts of having an inaccurate birth certificate.Any state, local, or territorial government that adopts the recom-mended statutory language (via statute, regulation, or written policy) can besure that it has improved its own functioning and has enabled transgenderpeople to live their lives with one less burden imposed on them by thegovernment.As birth certificate statutes and policies are modernized, the birth cer-tificate's legal relevance should increase because judges will be better able todefer to those documents when they have been corrected. However, untilthen, their legal weight in cases where a person has been unable to receive acorrected certificate should not be controlling. Eventually, the hope is thatboth executive agencies and the judicial system will be able to rely on birthcertificates as an accurate indicator of gender.While these changes in vital statistics laws may seem technical in na-ture, modernizing these laws will have important and positive human im-pact, and should not be avoided or delayed any longer. Given the solid legaland medical foundation for updating these laws discussed in the Article,these changes should be viewed as cost-neutral or cost-saving, based on thebest science available, and rooted in the constitution. Policymakers inter-ested in good government should take these developments seriously andmake the necessary amendments immediately. t4512013]1MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW452I-U[Vol. 19:3730U0muQ0 V> u<0 ar<x Nbb U0oC\\ GN GC4C4 C42013] MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTES 453MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAWo0-0Co C 0,0 0ox o2 0~Ec0 5s 0 C0 00) z-cC C 0454 [Vol. 19:373455MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESCD c LC -aa20131, AMICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER 6- LAW [Vol.19:3734562013] MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTES 457MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [Vol. 19:3734584592013] MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTESEMICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER &LAW-- 20 ~0is0~ E0E --z0 -0 0 10E2 zr0~ 00 0 012 z0<00 00.2 Cc00 ~ ~ E 0 c! cS 0c!z0 *- 000.~ 00460 [Vol. 19:37320131 MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTES 461MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER d- LAW [Vol. 19:3734622013] MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTES 463464 MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER d- LAW [Vol. 19:3732013] MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTES 465MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [Vol. 19:3734662013] MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTES 467I468 MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [Vol. 19:3730E .'a 2-S EP 0EE -Z6 rL' Cz.Q 2z ' 2~C52-c 0= - -C> oau 2.>2013] MODERNIZING STATE VITAL STATISTICS STATUTES 469470 MICHIGAN JOURNAL OF GENDER & LAW [Vol. 19:373",

    "abstract": "Across the country, laws governing corrections to gender markers on birth certificates are relatively uniform, in large part because many states adopted the relevant provisions of the 1977 revision of the Model State Vital Statistics Act (MSVSA). The MSVSA, developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, guides states on the most efficient laws and procedures related to maintaining accurate birth, death, and other vital records at the state, local, and territorial level. At the time when the government promulgated the MSVSA provision related to gender corrections, it served as a forward-thinking model because it acknowledged that vital records should be corrected in the case of individuals who change their gender. Specifically, the 1977 MSVSA recommended that corrections to gender markers on birth certificates be granted after applicants change their sex by  surgical procedure  and provide a court order to that effect. Additionally, the MSVSA recommended that the correction be kept private. Over the past three decades, transgender legal rights have advanced and understanding of transgender medicine has evolved. Experts in transgender law and medicine entirely reject the idea that recognition of a person\\u27s gender should come only after surgery. This notion has also been significantly eroded in law and policy. Yet, with the exception of new laws and/or policies in three states, birth certificate statutes and policies have yet to be modernized in this respect. This Article explains why and how state, local, and territorial birth certificate laws and regulations ought to be revised based on changes in law and medicine. In addition, the Article discusses public policy factors that governments should consider when modernizing their policies, including the cost of various policies and the policies\\u27 legal and practical effects on the lives of transgender people",
