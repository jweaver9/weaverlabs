We conducted a scopingreview to 1) identify and describe the psychosocial impacts of equal marriage rights amongsexual minority adults, and 2) explore sexual minority women (SMW) perceptions of equalmarriage rights and whether psychosocial impacts differ by sex. Using Arksey and O’Mal-ley’s framework we reviewed peer-reviewed English-language publications from 2000through 2019. We searched six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science,JSTOR, and Sociological Abstracts) to identify English language, peer-reviewed journal arti-cles reporting findings from empirical studies with an explicit focus on the experiences andperceived impact of equal marriage rights among sexual minority adults. We found 59 stud-ies that met our inclusion criteria. Studies identified positive psychosocial impacts of same-sex marriage (e.g., increased social acceptance, reduced stigma) across individual, inter-personal (dyad, family), community (sexual minority), and broader societal levels. Studiesalso found that, despite equal marriage rights, sexual minority stigma persists across theselevels. Only a few studies examined differences by sex, and findings were mixed. Researchto date has several limitations; for example, it disproportionately represents samples fromthe U.S. and White populations, and rarely examines differences by sexual or gender iden-tity or other demographic characteristics. There is a need for additional research on theimpact of equal marriage rights and same-sex marriage on the health and well-being ofdiverse sexual minorities across the globe.PLOS ONEPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 1 / 22a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111OPEN ACCESSCitation: Drabble LA, Wootton AR, Veldhuis CB,Riggle EDB, Rostosky SS, Lannutti PJ, et al.

Dr. Veldhuis’participation in this research was made possiblethrough an NIH/NIAAA Ruth KirschsteinPostdoctoral Research Fellowship (F32AA025816;IntroductionLegalization of same-sex marriage represents one important step toward advancing equalrights for sexual and gender minorities. Over the past two decades same-sex marriage hasbecome legally recognized in multiple countries around the world. Between 2003 and mid-2015, same-sex couples in the United States (U.S.) gained the right to marry in 37 of 50 states.This right was extended to all 50 states in June 2015, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled inObergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples in all U.S. states had equal marriage rights. As ofOctober 2019, same-sex couples had the right to marry in 30 countries and territories aroundthe world [1].National laws or policies that extend equal marriage rights to same-sex couples signal areduction in structural stigma and have the potential to positively impact the health and well-being of sexual minorities. Structural stigma refers to norms and policies on societal, institu-tional and cultural levels that negatively impact the opportunities, access, and well-being of aparticular group [2]. Forms of structural stigma that affect sexual minorities—such as restric-tions on same-sex marriage—reflect and reinforce the social stigma against non-heterosexualpeople that occurs at individual, interpersonal, and community levels [3]. According to Hat-zenbuehler and colleagues, structural stigma is an under-recognized contributor to health dis-parities among stigmatized populations [4–6], and reductions in structural stigma canimprove health outcomes among sexual minorities [7, 8].Marriage is a fundamental institution across societies and access to the right to marry canreduce sexual-minority stigma by integrating sexual minority people more fully into society [9].Same-sex marriage also provides access to a wide range of tangible benefits and social opportu-nities associated with marriage [9, 10]. Despite the benefits of marriage rights, sexual minoritiescontinue to experience stigma-related stressors, such as rejection from family or community,and discrimination in employment and other life spheres [11]. In addition, reactions to same-sex marriage appear to differ among sexual minorities and range from positive to ambivalent[11–13]. Extending marriage rights to same-sex couples remedies only one form of structuralstigma. Although legalization of same-sex marriage represents a positive shift in the social andpolitical landscape, the negative impact of social stigma may persist over time. For example, arecent Dutch study found that despite 20 years of equal marriage rights, sexual minority adoles-cents continue to show higher rates of substance use and lower levels of well-being than theirheterosexual peers [14]. This study underscores the importance of understanding the compleximpact of stigma at the structural, community, interpersonal, and individual levels.Impact on sexual minority healthA growing body of literature, using different methods from diverse countries where same-sexmarriage has been debated or adopted, provides important insights into the impact of equalmarriage rights on the health and well-being of sexual minority individuals. Research to datehas consistently found that legal recognition of same-sex marriage has a positive impact onhealth outcomes among sexual and gender minority populations [15–20]. Studies in the U.S.have found evidence of reduced psychological distress and improved self-reported healthamong sexual minorities living in states with equal marriage rights compared to those living instates without such rights [5, 21–23]. One state-specific study also found improved health out-comes for sexual minority men after legalization of same-sex marriage [24]. Furthermore, sex-ual minorities living in states that adopted, or were voting on, legislation restricting marriagerecognition to different-sex couples reported higher rates of alcohol use disorders and psycho-logical distress compared to those living in states without such restrictions [5, 25–31]. Consis-tent with research in the U.S., findings from research in Australia on marriage restrictionPLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 2 / 22PI C.

An emerging body of quantitativeand qualitative literature affords a timely opportunity to examine a wide range of psychosocialimpacts of equal marriage rights. Understanding these impacts is important to guide and inter-pret future research about the potential protective health effects of same-sex marriage.Potential differences between SMW and SMMGiven the dearth of research focusing on the health and well-being of sexual minority women(SMW), especially compared to the sizable body of research on sexual minority men (SMM)[33, 34], there is a need to explore whether the emerging literature on same-sex marriage pro-vides insights about potential differences in psychosocial impacts between SMW and SMM.Recent research underscores the importance of considering SMW’s perspectives and experi-ences related to same-sex marriage. For example, gendered social norms play out differently forwomen and men in same-sex and different-sex marriages, and interpersonal dynamics andbehaviors, including those related to coping with stress, are influenced by gender socialization[35]. However, there is little research about how societal-level gender norms and genderedsocial constructions of marriage may be reflected in SMW’s perceptions of same-sex marriage.Structural sexism (e.g., gendered power and resource inequality at societal and institutional lev-els) differentially impacts women’s and men’s health [36], and may also contribute to sex differ-ences in experiences and impacts of same-sex marriage. For example, research from the U.S.suggests that same-sex marriage rights may improve health outcomes and access to healthcarefor SMM, but evidence is less robust for SMW [37–39]. Differences in health outcomes appearto be at least partially explained by lower socioeconomic status (income, employment status,perceived financial strain) among SMW compared to SMM [40]. Further, other psychosocialfactors may contribute to differential experiences of legalized same-sex marriage. For example,a study of older sexual minority adults in states with equal marriage rights found that marriedSMW experienced more LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) microaggressionsthan single SMW, but no differences by relationship status were noted among SMM [41]. Meannumber of microaggressions experienced by SMW in partnered unmarried relationships fellbetween, but were not significantly different from, that of married and single SMW.Theoretical frameworkSocial-ecological and stigma theoretical perspectives were used as the framework for organiz-ing literature in this review (See Fig 1). Stigma occurs and is experienced by sexual minoritiesat individual, interpersonal, and structural levels, which mirror the levels of focus within thesocial-ecological framework [6, 42]. Consequently, changes such as extending equal marriagerights to same-sex couples may influence sexual minorities’ experiences of stigma across all ofthese levels [43]. Gaining access to the institution of marriage is distinct from marital status(or being married) and likely impacts sexual minority adults across individual, interpersonal,and community contexts [44], regardless of relationship status.From a social-ecological perspective, individual and interpersonal processes can amplify orweaken the impact of structural level policies, such as equal marriage rights, on sexual minorityindividuals’ health and well-being [43, 45, 46]. For example, on an individual level, experiencesPLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 3 / 22and perceptions of equal marriage rights may influence stigma-related processes such as inter-nalized heterosexism, comfort with disclosure, and centrality of sexual identity [47]. Interper-sonal and community level interactions may trigger stigma-related processes such as prejudiceconcerns, vigilance, or mistrust. Such processes may in turn, influence the impact of social pol-icy change on sexual minority stress and well-being [48–50].The impact of equal marriage rights among sexual minority individuals may also be influ-enced by other social and political factors such as state- or regional-level social climate [50–52], or inconsistency among other policy protections against discrimination (e.g., in housingor public accommodations) [11, 50]. Sociopolitical uncertainty may continue long after theright to marry is extended to same-sex couples [53, 54]. Monk and Ogolsky [44] define politi-cal uncertainty as a state of “having doubts about legal recognition bestowed on individualsand families by outside systems; being unsure about social acceptance of marginalized rela-tionships; being unsure about how ‘traditional’ social norms and roles pertain to marginalizedrelationships or how alternative scripts might unfold” (p. 2).Current studyThe overall aim of this scoping review was to identify and summarize existing literature onpsychosocial impacts of equal marriage rights among sexual minority adults. Specific objec-tives were to: 1) identify and describe the psychosocial impacts of equal marriage rights on sex-ual minority adults; and 2) explore SMW-specific perceptions of equal marriage rights andwhether psychosocial impacts differ for SMM and SMW.MethodsStudy designWe used a scoping review approach, as it is well-suited for aims designed to provide a descrip-tive overview of a large and diverse body of literature [55]. Scoping reviews have become aFig 1.

Scoping reviews summarize the range of research, identify key characteristics or factorsrelated to concepts, and identify knowledge gaps in particular areas of study [56, 57]. By con-trast, systematic reviews are more narrowly focused on creating a critically appraised synthe-sized answer to a particular question pertinent to clinical practice or policy making [57]. Weaimed to characterize and summarize research related to psychosocial impacts of equal mar-riage rights and same-sex marriage, including potential gaps in research specific to SMW. Fol-lowing Arksey and O’Malley [56], the review was conducted using the following steps: 1)identifying the research question, 2) identifying relevant studies, 3) selecting studies, 4) chartingthe data, and 5) collating, summarizing and reporting results. Because this is a scoping review, itwas not registered with PROSPERO, an international registry for systematic reviews.Selection methodThe authors used standard procedures for conducting scoping reviews, including followingPRISMA guidelines [58]. Articles that report findings from empirical studies with an explicitfocus on the psychosocial impacts of equal marriage rights and same-sex marriage on sexualminority adults are included in this review. All database searches were limited to studies inEnglish language journals published from 2000 through 2019 (our most recent search was exe-cuted in June 2020). This time frame reflects the two decades since laws regarding same-sex mar-riage began to change in various countries or jurisdictions within countries. Literature reviewarticles and commentaries were excluded. To ensure that sources had been vetted for scientificquality by experts, only articles in peer-reviewed journals were included; books and research inthe grey literature (e.g., theses, dissertations, and reports) were excluded. There was no restrictionon study location. A librarian searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index toNursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, JSTOR, and Sociological Abstracts data-bases using combinations of key search terms. Following is an example of the search terms usedin CINAHL database searches: ((TI \"marriage recognition\" OR AB \"marriage recognition\") OR(TI marriage OR AB marriage) OR (TI same-sex OR AB same-sex) OR (TI \"same sex\" OR AB\"same sex\")) AND ((TI LGBT OR AB LGBT) OR (TI gay OR AB gay) OR (TI lesbian OR AB les-bian) OR (TI bisexual OR AB bisexual) OR (TI transgender OR AB transgender) OR (TI Ober-gefell OR AB Obergefell) OR (TI \"sexual minorities\" OR AB \"sexual minorities))Articles were selected in two stages of review. In stage one, the first author and librarianindependently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion or exclusion using eligibility criteria.We excluded articles focused solely on the impact of relationship status on health outcomes,satisfaction or dynamics within marriage relationships, or the process of getting married (e.g.,choices of who to invite, type of ceremony), or other topics that did not pertain directly to theresearch aims. For example, a study about the impact of getting married that also includedthemes pertaining to the impact or meaning of equal marriage rights was included in the fullreview. The first author and a librarian met to review and resolve differences and, in caseswhere relevance was ambiguous, articles underwent a full-text review (in stage 2). Table 1 sum-marizes exclusion categories used in the title and abstract reviews.In stage two, articles not excluded in stage one were retrieved for full-text review. Each articlewas independently reviewed by two authors to assess study relevance. Discrepancies related toinclusion were few (less than 10%) and resolved through discussion and consensus-buildingamong the first four authors. This process resulted in an analytic sample of 59 articles (see Fig 2).Table 2 provides an overview of characteristics of the studies included in this scopingreview. Most were qualitative and most aggregated SMW and SMM in analyses. Only 14 stud-ies explored differences in impact for SMW and SMM, or separately examined the specificPLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 5 / 22perceptions and experiences of SMW. Although search terms were inclusive of transgenderindividuals, samples in the studies we reviewed rarely included or focused explicitly on experi-ences of transgender or gender nonbinary identified individuals. In studies that explicitlyincluded transgender and nonbinary individuals, sample sizes were rarely large enough to per-mit examination of differences based on gender identity (e.g., survey samples with 2–3% repre-sentation of nonbinary or transgender individuals) [44, 59–63].

Among studies in which participantrace/ethnicity was reported, most included samples that were majority White.Studies of the impact of legalized marriage on physical health were not excluded in the orig-inal search parameters; however, physical health has been addressed in prior reviews [15–20].Further, because our research questions focused on psychosocial factors, we excluded studieson physical health unless they also addressed individual, interpersonal, or community psycho-social impacts of same-sex marriage legalization. Studies that focused on physical healthimpacts or access to health insurance were used only in the introduction.Civil union was not explicitly included as a search parameter, but articles focusing on civilunions were captured in our search. Although civil unions are not equivalent to marriage, theyoften confer similar substantive legal rights. We included articles about civil union that explic-itly pertained to our research question, such as a study that examined perceived stigma anddiscrimination before and after implementation of civil union legislation in one U.S. state [64],and excluded articles that did not (e.g., a study of relationship quality or longevity amongsame-sex couples in civil unions) [65].Table 2.

Of those sampling a singlestate, all focused on the impact of changes (or proposed changes) in same-sex marriage policy:10 focused on Massachusetts (the first state in the U.S. to legalize same-sex marriage), twofocused on Iowa, two on Vermont, and two on California. One article each included study par-ticipants from Nebraska, Oregon, Illinois, and a small (unnamed) non-metropolitan town inthe Midwest.Analysis methodWe created a data extraction form to ensure consistency across team members in extractingkey study information and characteristics including study design (e.g., quantitative, qualitative,or mixed method), location (e.g., country and/or region), sample (e.g., whether the studyincluded or excluded SMW or SMM, assessed and reported race/ethnicity), and key results.Articles were also classified based on findings related to level of impact (e.g., individual, couple,family, community, or broader social attitudes toward LGBTQ+ individuals; see S1 Table). Afinal category on significance/implications allowed reviewers to further identify and commenton major themes and relevance to the current review. Themes were then identified and orga-nized using stigma and social-ecological frameworks.ResultsAim 1: Psychosocial impacts of same-sex marriage rightsIndividual level impacts. Although most studies about the impact of equal marriagerights have been conducted with couples or individuals in committed or married relationships,15 studies in this review included sexual minority adults across relationship statuses. In gen-eral, studies examining the impact of equal marriage rights among sexual minorities suggestthat equal access to marriage has a positive impact on perceptions of social acceptance andsocial inclusion regardless of relationship status [47, 63, 66, 67]. For example, Riggle and col-leagues [47] examined perceptions of sexual minority individuals in the U.S. during the periodin which same-sex couples had equal marriage rights in some, but not all, U.S. states. Sexualminorities who resided in states with equal marriage rights reported less identity concealment,vigilance, and isolation than their peers in states without equal marriage rights. Similarly,using data from the longitudinal Nurses’ Health Study in the U.S., Charlton and colleagues[68] examined potential positive impacts of equal marriage rights on sexual identity disclosure.They found that participants living in states with any form of legal recognition of same-sexrelationships (inclusive of marriage, civil unions, or domestic partnerships) were 30% morelikely than those is states without legal recognition to consistently disclose a sexual minorityidentity across survey waves [68].Researchers have documented ambivalence among sexual minority adults regarding theinstitution of marriage and whether same-sex marriage would impact other forms of structuralor interpersonal stigma. Sexual minority participants in several studies expressed concernabout continued interpersonal stigma based on sexual or gender identity, the limitations ofmarriage as a vehicle for providing benefits and protections for economically marginalizedLGBTQ+ individuals, and the possibility that an increased focus on marriage would contributeto devaluing unmarried same-sex relationships [12, 13, 62, 69, 70]. Studies also documentedconcerns about marriage being inherently linked to heteronormative expectations and aboutassimilation to heterosexist cultural norms [60, 69, 71]. These concerns were summarized byHull [69]: “The fact that LGBTQ respondents favor marriage more in principle (as a right)PLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 8 / 22than in practice (as an actual social institution) suggests that marriage holds multiple meaningsfor them” (p. 1360).Five studies explicitly examined racial/ethnic minority identities as a factor in individuals’perceptions of same-sex marriage; one qualitative study focused exclusively on Black individu-als in the U.S. [72] and the other four examined differences by race/ethnicity [64, 66, 67, 73].McGuffy [72] conducted in-depth interviews with 102 Black LGBT individuals about their per-ceptions of marriage as a civil rights issue before and after same-sex marriage was recognizednationally in the U.S. The study found that intersecting identities and experiences of discrimi-nation related to racism, homophobia, and transphobia influenced personal views of marriage.For example, although most participants were supportive of equal marriage rights as a publicgood, many felt that the emphasis on marriage in social movement efforts overlooked otherimportant issues, such as racism, economic injustice, and transgender marginalization.The four other studies examining racial/ethnic differences in perceptions about whetherequal marriage rights facilitated inclusion or reduced interpersonal stigma yielded mixedresults. One found that residing in states with equal marriage rights was associated with greaterfeelings of acceptance among sexual minorities; however, White sexual minorities reportedgreater feelings of inclusion than participants of color [66]. By contrast, in a quasi-experimentin which SMW in a midwestern state were interviewed pre- or post- passage of civil union legis-lation, those interviewed after the legislation reported lower levels of stigma consciousness andperceived discrimination than those interviewed before the legislation; however, effects werestronger among SMW of color than among White SMW [64]. In a study of unmarried men insame-sex male couples, Hispanic/Latino men were more likely than non-Latino White partici-pants to report perceived gains in social inclusion after equal marriage rights were extended toall U.S. states [67]. However, men who reported higher levels of minority stress (enacted andanticipated stigma as well as internalized homophobia) were less likely to show improvement inperceptions of social inclusion. Lee [73], using data from a national Social Justice Sexuality Proj-ect survey, found no statistical differences in Black, White and Latinx sexual minorities’ percep-tions that equal marriage rights for same-sex couples had a moderate to major impact on theirlives. In analyses restricted to Black participants, individuals with higher level of sexual minorityidentity salience reported significantly higher importance of equal marriage rights. Lee suggeststhat same-sex marriage was perceived by many study participants as a tool to gain greater accep-tance in the Black community because being married is a valued social status.Couple level impacts. We identified 15 studies that focused on couples as the unit of analy-sis. Findings from studies of the extension of equal marriage rights in U.S. states suggest positiveimpacts among same-sex couples, including access to financial and legal benefits as well asinterpersonal validation, such as perceptions of being viewed as a “real” couple and increasedsocial inclusion [12, 59, 63, 74, 75]. Furthermore, couples in several studies described the poten-tial positive impacts of legal recognition of their relationship on their ability to make joint deci-sions about life issues, such as having children and medical care [75]. Couples also describedhaving a greater sense of security associated with financial (e.g., taxes, healthcare) and legal (e.g.,hospital visitation) benefits and reduced stress in areas such as travel and immigration [75]. Col-lectively, these findings suggest that marriage rights were perceived to imbue individuals insame-sex relationships with a sense of greater security, stability, and safety due to the legal rec-ognition and social legitimization of same-sex couples. Although equal marriage rights wereperceived as an important milestone in obtaining civil rights and reducing institutional discrim-ination, concerns about and experiences of interpersonal stigma persisted [76–78]. The socialcontext of legal same-sex marriage may create stress for couples who elect to not marry. Forexample, in a study of 27 committed, unmarried same-sex couples interviewed after the U.S.PLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 9 / 22Supreme Court decision on Obergefell, couples who chose not to marry described feeling thattheir relationships were less supported and perceived as less committed [79].Reports from the CUPPLES study, a national longitudinal study of same-sex couples in theU.S. from 2001 to 2014, provided a unique opportunity to examine the impact of differentforms of legal recognition of same-sex relationships. In wave three of the study during 2013–2014, open-ended qualitative questions were added to explore how individuals in long-termcommitted partnerships perceived the extension of equal marriage rights in many U.S. states.Themes included awe about the historic achievement of a long-awaited civil rights goal, cele-bration and elation, and affirmation of minority sexual identity and relationships, but alsofears of backlash against sexual minority rights [80]. Some individuals who divorced after insti-tutionalization of the right to same-sex marriage reported shame, guilt, and disappointment—given that they and others had fought so hard for equal marriage rights [81].Studies outside the U.S. have also found evidence of positive impacts of legal recognition ofsame-sex couple relationships (e.g., increased social recognition and social support), as well aspotential concerns [82–86]. For example, in a study of couples from the first cohort of same-sex couples to legally marry in Canada, participants described marriage as providing themwith language to describe their partner that was more socially understood and helping todecrease homophobic attitudes among the people around them [83]. Some couples said theycould fully participate in society and that marriage normalized their lives and allowed them to“live more publicly.” Couples also discussed the safety, security, and increased commitmentthat came from marriage, and some felt that marriage opened up previously unavailable orunimagined opportunities, such as becoming parents. However, some participants noted thattheir marriage caused disjuncture in relationships with their family of origin, as marriagemade the relationship feel too real to family members and made their sexual identities morepublicly visible.Family level impacts. Seventeen studies examined the impact of equal marriage rights onsexual minority individuals’ or couples’ relationships with their families of origin. Althoughthese studies predominately used cross-sectional survey designs, one longitudinal studyincluded individuals in both different-sex and same-sex relationships before and after the U.S.Supreme Court decision that extended marriage rights to all states [44]. This study found thatsupport from family members increased following national legalization of same-sex marriage[44]. A cross-sectional online survey of 556 individuals with same-sex partners in Massachu-setts (the first U.S. state to extend equal marriage rights to same-sex couples), found thatgreater family support and acceptance of same-sex couples who married was associated with astronger overall sense of social acceptance [66].Other cross-sectional surveys found mixed perceptions of family support and feelings ofsocial acceptance. For example, a study of 357 participants in long-term same-sex relationshipsfound that perceived social support from family did not vary by state-level marriage rights ormarital status [47]. However, living in a state with same-sex marriage rights was associatedwith feeling less isolated. The finding of no differences in perceived support might be partlyexplained by the fact that the sample included only couples in long-term relationships; older,long-term couples may rely less on support from their family of origin than younger couples[12].In studies (n = 6) that included dyadic interviews with same-sex married couples [74, 79,85, 87–89], participants described a wide range of family members’ reactions to their marriage.These reactions, which emerged after same-sex marriage legalization, were typically describedby couples as profoundly impactful. Couples who perceived increased family support andacceptance described these changes as triumphant [85], transformative [88], and validating[74, 87]. Conversely, some same-sex couples reported feeling hurt and betrayed when familialPLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 10 / 22reactions were negative or when reactions among family members were divided [85, 87, 89].Findings from these and other studies suggest that if certain family members were acceptingor rejecting prior to marriage, they tended to remain so after equal marriage rights and/or thecouple’s marriage [61, 74, 90, 91]. In some cases, family members were perceived as toleratingthe same-sex relationship but disapproving of same-sex marriage [85, 90].Findings from studies of married sexual minority people suggest that family (especiallyparental) disapproval was a challenge in the decision to get married [92], possibly because dis-closure of marriage plans by same-sex couples frequently disrupted family “privacy rules” andlong-time patterns of sexual identity concealment within families or social networks [87]. In afew studies, same-sex partners perceived that their marriage gave their relationship more legit-imacy in the eyes of some family members, leading to increased support and inclusion [61, 66,89–91]. Further, findings from two studies suggested that participating in same-sex weddingsgave family members the opportunity to demonstrate support and solidarity [87, 93].Two qualitative studies collected data from family members of same-sex couples. In one,heterosexual siblings (all of whom were in different-sex marriages) described a range of reac-tions to marriage equality—from support for equal marriage rights to disapproval [80]. Theother study interviewed sexual minority migrants to sexual minority friendly countries inEurope who were married and/or raising children with a same-sex partner, and thesemigrant’s parents who lived in Central and Eastern European countries that prohibited same-sex marriage. Parents found it difficult to accept their adult child’s same-sex marriage, but thepresence of grandchildren helped to facilitate acceptance [94].Community level impacts. Twelve studies in this review examined the community-levelimpacts of same-sex marriage. These studies focused on community level impacts from twoperspectives: impacts of equal marriage rights on LGBTQ+ communities, and the impacts ofequal marriage rights on LGBTQ+ individuals’ interactions with their local communities orextended social networks.LGBTQ+ communities. A prominent theme among these studies was that marriage is bene-ficial to LGBTQ+ communities because it provides greater protection, recognition, and accep-tance of sexual minorities, their families, and their relationships—even beyond the immediateimpact on any individual and their relationship or marriage [12, 62, 89, 95]. Despite these per-ceived benefits, studies have found that some sexual minority adults view marriage as poten-tially harmful to LGBTQ+ communities because of concerns about increased assimilation andmainstreaming of LGBTQ+ identities [12, 50, 62], stigmatizing unmarried relationships [62],and weakening of unique and valued strengths of LGBTQ+ culture [12]. For example, Bern-stein, Harvey, and Naples [96] interviewed 52 Australian LGBTQ+ activists and legislatorswho worked alongside activists for equal marriage rights. These authors described the “assimi-lationist dilemma” faced by activists: a concern that gaining acceptance into the mainstreamsocietal institution of marriage would lessen the salience of LGBTQ+ identity and ultimatelydiminish the richness and strength of LGBTQ+ communities. Another downside of the focuson marriage as a social movement goal was the concern about reinforcing negative heteronor-mative aspects of marriage rather than challenging them [95].Four studies explicitly examined possible community level impacts of same-sex marriage.In a mixed-methods study with 115 LGBTQ+ individuals in Massachusetts, participantsreported believing that increased acceptance and social inclusion as a result of equal marriagerights might lessen reliance on LGBTQ+-specific activism, events, activities, and venues forsocial support [13]. However, a majority of study participants (60%) reported participating inLGBTQ+-specific events, activities, or venues “regularly.” A few studies found evidence of con-cerns that the right to marry could result in marriage being more valued than other relation-ship configurations [12, 62, 79].PLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 11 / 22Local community contexts and extended social networks. Studies examining the impact ofsame-sex marriage on sexual minority individuals’ interactions with their extended social net-works and in local community contexts yielded mixed results. In an interview study with 19same-sex couples living in the Netherlands, Badgett [66] found that LGBTQ+ people experi-enced both direct and indirect increases in social inclusion in their communities and extendedsocial networks as a result of equal marriage rights. For example, direct increases in socialinclusion included people making supportive comments to the couple and attending theirmarriage ceremonies; examples of indirect increases included same-sex spouses being incorpo-rated into family networks [66]. Other studies found mixed or no change in support forLGBTQ+ people and their relationships. Kennedy, Dalla, and Dreesman [61] collected surveydata from 210 married LGBTQ+ individuals in midwestern U.S. states, half of whom were liv-ing in states with equal marriage rights at the time of data collection. Most participants did notperceive any change in support from their community/social network following legalization ofsame-sex marriage; other participants reported an increase or mixed support from friends andco-workers. Similarly, Wootton and colleagues interviewed 20 SMW from 15 U.S. states andfound positive, neutral, and negative impacts of same-sex marriage on their interactions inwork and community contexts [50]. Participants perceived increased positivity about LGBTQ+ issues and more accepting attitudes within their extended social networks and local commu-nities, but also reported hearing negative comments about sexual minority people more fre-quently and experiencing continued sexual orientation-based discrimination and stigma [50].Many SMW reported feeling safer and having more positive conversations after Obergefell,but also continued to have concerns about being out at work as a sexual minority person [50].Two studies examined the experiences of LGBTQ+ people in U.S. states in which same-sexmarriage restrictions were decided by voters through ballot measures. These studies docu-mented mixed impacts on participants’ interactions with extended social networks and com-munity. Maisel and Fingerhut [28] surveyed 354 sexual minority adults in Californiaimmediately before the vote to restrict recognition of marriage to one man and one woman inthe state (Proposition 8) and found that about one-third experienced interactions with socialnetwork members that were positive, whereas just under one-third were negative, and the restwere either mixed or neutral. Overall, sexual minority people reported more support than con-flict with extended social network members and heterosexual community members over theballot measure, with friends providing the most support [28]. Social support and solidarityfrom extended social network members in the face of ballot measures to restrict marriage rec-ognition were also reported in an interview study of 57 same-sex couples residing in one ofseven U.S. states that had passed marriage restriction amendments in 2006 [97]. However,some LGBTQ+ people also experienced condemnation and avoidance in their extended socialnetworks [97].Societal level impacts. Sixteen studies examined ways that same-sex marriage influencedsocietal attitudes about sexual minority individuals or contributed to additional shifts in poli-cies protecting the rights of sexual minority individuals. Findings suggested that the right ofsame-sex couples to marry had a positive influence on the political and socio-cultural contextof sexual minorities’ lives. For example, changes in laws may influence social attitudes or resultin LGBTQ positive policy diffusion across states (jurisdictions). There is debate over whetherlegal changes, such as equal marriage rights, create or are simply reflective of changes in socialattitudes toward a group or a social issue [98]. Flores and Barclay [98] theorize four differentsocio-political responses to changes in marriage laws: backlash, legitimacy, polarization, andconsensus. Some scholars argue that changes in law are unlikely to impact social attitudes(consensus), while others argue that legal changes influence the political and social environ-ment that shapes social attitudes. Possible effects range from decreased support for sexualPLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 12 / 22minorities and attempts to rescind rights (backlash) to greater support for the rights of sexualminorities and possible future expansion of rights and protections (legitimacy).Findings from research generally suggest a positive relationship between same-sex marriageand public support for the overall rights of sexual minorities (legitimacy), and mixed resultsrelated to changes in mass attitudes (consensus) [98–106]. For example, in a panel study in Iowabefore and after a state Supreme Court ruling in favor of equal marriage rights, Kreitzer and col-leagues found that the change in law modified registered voters’ views of the legitimacy of same-sex marriage and that some respondents felt “pressure” to modify or increase their expressedsupport [102]. Similarly, Flores and Barclay [98] found that people in a state with equal marriagerights showed a greater reduction in anti-gay attitudes than people in a state without equal mar-riage rights. Studies based on data from European countries also found that more positive atti-tudes toward sexual minorities were associated with equal marriage rights; improvements inattitudes were not evident in countries without equal marriage rights [9, 105, 106].There is some evidence to support the third possible socio-political response to changes inmarriage laws in Flores and Barclay’s model: increased polarization of the general public’s atti-tudes toward sexual minorities. Perrin, Smith, and colleagues [107], using successive-indepen-dent samples study of conservatives, moderates, and progressives across the U.S. found nooverall changes in opinions attitudes about sexual minorities immediately after the SupremeCourt decision extending equal marriage rights to all same-sex couples in the U.S. However,analyses by subgroup found that those who were conservative expressed more prejudicetoward gay men and lesbians, less support for same-sex marriage, and less support for LGBcivil rights immediately after the decision. Similarly, drawing on data from approximately onemillion respondents in the U.S. who completed implicit and explicit measures of bias againstgay men and lesbian women (Project Implicit), Ofosu and colleagues [100] found that implicitbias decreased sharply following Obergefell. However, changes in attitudes were moderated bystate laws; respondents in states that already had equal marriage rights for same-sex couplesdemonstrated decreased bias whereas respondents in states that did not yet have equal mar-riage rights evidenced increased bias [100]. Using data from the World Values Survey (1989–2014) in European countries, Redman [103] found that equal marriage rights were associatedwith increases in positive opinions about sexual minorities, but that the increase was drivenlargely by those who already held positive views.Little support has been found for the hypothesis that the extension of equal marriage rightswould be followed by a backlash of sharp negative shifts in mass attitudes and public policy[98, 108, 109]. For example, a general population survey in one relatively conservative U.S.state (Nebraska) found public support for same-sex marriage was higher after the SupremeCourt ruling than before, suggesting no backlash in public opinion [108]. Similarly, Bishin andcolleagues [109], using both an online survey experiment and analysis of data from a U.S. pub-lic opinion poll (National Annenberg Election Studies) before and after three relevant policyevents, found little change in public opinion in response to simulated or actual policy changes.Although equal marriage rights confer parental recognition rights, there are still legal chal-lenges and disparate rulings and interpretations about some family law issues [77, 110, 111].For example, some states in the U.S. have treated the parental rights of same-sex couples differ-ently than those of different-sex (presumed heterosexual) couples. Both members of a same-sex couple have traditionally not been automatically recognized as parents of a child born oradopted within the relationship. However, the presumptions of parenthood after same-sexmarriage was legalized have forced states to treat both members of same-sex couples as parentsirrespective of method of conception or adoption status [112]. Still, results from a cross-national study of laws, policies, and legal recognition of same-sex relationships suggests thatparental rights are recognized in some jurisdictions but not others [111].PLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 13 / 22Aim 2: SMW-specific findings and differences by genderA total of 13 studies included in this review conducted SMW-specific analyses or comparedSMW and SMM’s perceptions and experiences of same-sex marriage and equal marriagerights. In studies that included only SMW [50, 64, 68, 77, 81, 86, 89, 91], findings emphasizedthe importance of relational and interpersonal impacts of same-sex marriage. Examplesinclude creating safety for sexual identity disclosure and visibility [68, 81], providing legal pro-tections in relation to partners and/or children [77, 81], offering social validation [86, 89], andreducing stigma in larger community contexts [50, 64]. Relational themes centered on con-cerns and distress when experiencing rejection or absence of support from family members orextended social networks [50, 81, 86, 89, 91].Two of the studies of SMW documented sexual identity and gender identity differences ininterpersonal experiences associated with same-sex marriage [86, 89]. Lannutti’s interviewstudy of the experiences of 26 married or engaged SMW couples with different sexual identi-ties (bisexual-lesbian couples) revealed how the right to marry made them feel more connectedto LGBTQ+ communities through activism and being “counted” as a same-sex married cou-ple. However, same-sex marriage made some bisexual women feel more invisible withinLGBTQ+ communities [89]. Scott and Theron [86] found that married lesbian women andcisgender women partners of transmasculine individuals (i.e., masculine-identifying transgen-der individuals) faced different challenges as they navigated through gendered social expecta-tions and made choices about conforming or rejecting heteronormativity.Only five of the studies focusing on psychosocial impacts of equal marriage rights explicitlyexamined potential differences by sex [28, 66, 73, 76, 95]. Some studies found perceptions ofgreater social inclusion [66], or feelings of ambivalence (simultaneously holding positive, nega-tive, and critical perspectives about marriage as an institution) [95] that were similar amongSMW and SMM. Maisel and Fingerhut’s study of consequences of a state-level campaign torestrict marriage rights [28] showed that SMW and SMM experienced similar negative impactson personal well-being and interactions with extended social networks. However, Lee foundthat, compared with Black SMM, Black SMW perceived same-sex marriage to have a largerimpact on their lives [73]. Other studies found that SMW were more likely than SMM toreport positive perceptions of same-sex marriage, possibly because they are more likely thanSMM to have children and to be concerned about parental protections [73, 95]. SMW andSMM may be differentially impacted by interpersonal stigma despite equal marriage rights.For example, one study found that SMW experienced higher levels of distress than SMM whentheir relationships were not treated as equal to heterosexuals’ [76].DiscussionOverall, findings from this scoping review suggest that psychosocial impacts of equal mar-riage rights among sexual minorities are apparent at all levels of our social-ecological andstigma framework. Sexual minority-specific stigma occurs on multiple levels (e.g., individ-ual, interpersonal, and structural simultaneously and changes in social policies have cascad-ing effects on sexual minority individuals’ experiences at each level. Generally, equalmarriage rights had a positive impact on perceptions of social acceptance and social inclu-sion for sexual minority individuals, couples, and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole.However, many studies described mixed, ambivalent, or complicated perceptions of same-sex marriage, as well as stigmatizing interactions that were unaffected or exacerbated byequal marriage rights.Although research does not unequivocally suggest the presence of a backlash in public opin-ion after equal marriage rights, there has been an increase in laws and policies at the U.S. statePLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 14 / 22and federal levels that explicitly allow for religious-belief-based denial of services to sexualminority individuals and same-sex couples. For example, by 2017, 12 states in the U.S. enactedlaws permitting the denial of services (e.g., allowing government officials to refuse to issuesame-sex marriage licenses, allowing magistrates to refuse to perform same-sex marriages, andpermitting adoption and child welfare agencies to refuse same-sex couples’ adoption or foster-ing children) based on religious beliefs [113]. Research has documented negative health andpsychological outcomes among sexual minorities living in U.S. states with policies that permitdenial of services to sexual or gender minorities [114, 115] and in states that do not have legalprotections against discrimination [38, 116, 117]. Additional research is needed to examinehow changes in local or national laws impact the health and well-being of sexual and genderminorities—particularly over the long term.Gaps & future research needsResearch is limited in terms of examining how same-sex marriage may differentially impactsexual minority individuals based on sex, gender identity, or race/ethnicity. Only 14 studiesincluded in this review addressed the psychosocial impacts of same-sex marriage amongSMW. More research is needed to understand the unique experiences and psychosocial impactof same-sex marriage for SMW and SMM. Further, many study samples were largely homoge-nous and included an overwhelming majority of White participants. The few studies with sub-stantial sample sizes of people of color, and that compared people of color to White people,found differences by race in perceived impact of same-sex marriage [64, 67, 73], demonstratingthe need for additional work in this area.There were also very few studies in this review that explored differences by sexual identity(e.g., monosexual vs. plurisexual), gender identity (e.g., transgender vs. cisgender), genderexpression (e.g., masculine vs. feminine presentation), or differences based on sex/gender ofparticipants’ partners. Although transgender and nonbinary individuals were included in eightstudies, five provided only descriptive information and only three described any unique find-ings from transgender study participants. For example, McGuffey [72] found that transgenderindividuals who identified as heterosexual described same-sex marriage rights as less relevantthan issues of gender identity and expression and Hull found that cisgender sexual minoritymen generally expressed more enthusiasm about marriage than both cisgender women andtransgender individuals [69]. Transgender and nonbinary individuals who perceive positiveimpacts of equal marriage rights may still experience challenges in navigating heteronormativeand cisnormative expectations [72, 86]. Other qualitative studies documented concerns thatLGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, once marriage rights were secured, might fail to address rights andprotections for transgender and nonbinary individuals [62, 69]. Future studies that include thevoices of transgender and nonbinary individuals are needed to better understand perceptionsacross both sexual and gender identities [118].There is limited research on immediate and extended family members’ perceptions of equalmarriage rights. There is also a need for prospective studies that examine whether familialacceptance increases over time. Many studies did not account for differences in LGBTQ+ iden-tity salience and connection to LGBTQ+ and other communities, which may influence differ-ences in perceptions and reactions to same-sex marriage.The majority of studies (43 of 59) we reviewed were conducted in the U.S. Eleven of thesecollected data after Obergefell (June 25, 2015). Only two used longitudinal research designsthat included data collection before and after national same-sex marriage legalization [44,107]. The legal and social landscapes have changed since this time and there is a need for re-assessment of the impact of same-sex marriage over multiple future timepoints.PLOS ONE Psychosocial impacts of legalized same-sex marriage on sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249125 May 6, 2021 15 / 22LimitationsAlthough this scoping review used a systematic approach and, to our knowledge, is novel in itsfocus on impact of equal marriage rights on sexual minorities’ personal lives, interpersonalrelationships, and social/community contexts, we acknowledge several limitations. We did notconduct a search of grey literature (e.g., reports, policy literature, working papers) or booksand, consequently, likely excluded some scholarly work aligned with our focus. Our inclusioncriteria of only peer-reviewed studies may have led us to exclude dissertations that focus onemerging areas of research, such as differences by gender identity, sexual identity, or race andethnicity. As with all scoping reviews, studies may have been missed because of the searchstrategy. For example, it is possible that relevant studies were indexed in databases not used inour review. We also restricted our review to English language literature, excluding potentiallyrelevant studies published in other languages. Studies in other languages may provide usefulinsights from other countries where English is not widely used. Although we focused exclu-sively on empirical studies, we did not assess the quality of the studies. Findings of the revieware also limited by the collective body of research questions, designs, and analyses that havebeen pursued. For example, as noted above, few studies explored psychosocial impacts ofsame-sex marriage among SMW or explored differences by sex; consequently we were limitedin our ability to address our second research aim.ConclusionThis scoping review identified and described psychosocial impacts of equal marriage rightsamong sexual minority adults and explored potential SMW-specific experiences and differ-ences by sex. Our results highlight four points. First, equal marriage rights are associated witha wide range of positive impacts on the psychological and social well-being of sexual minorityadults. Second, the potential positive impacts of equal marriage rights are amplified or weak-ened by the presence or absence of stigma in interpersonal interactions and in the larger politi-cal and social environment. Third, although there is a growing body of global research on theimpact of same-sex marriage, most studies have been conducted in the U.S. Cross-culturalstudies can improve understanding of individual, interpersonal, and community level impactsof same-sex marriage in different cultural contexts. Fourth, given indications of differencesbetween SMW and SMM in perceived impact of same-sex marriage, there is a need forresearch that examines the specific perspectives of SMW and that explores possible differencesin perspectives and experiences by sex. Research is also needed to understand differencesbased on race/ethnicity, gender identity, and age. The right of same-sex couples to marry doesnot merely address the concerns of sexual minorities, it aims to right a far bigger wrong: theexclusion of some individuals from one of the most important institutions in social life.Supporting informationS1 Table.

    "abstract": "A growing body of literature provides important insights into the meaning and impact of the right to marry a same-sex partner among sexual minority people. We conducted a scoping review to 1) identify and describe the psychosocial impacts of equal marriage rights among sexual minority adults, and 2) explore sexual minority women (SMW) perceptions of equal marriage rights and whether psychosocial impacts differ by sex. Using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework we reviewed peer-reviewed English-language publications from 2000 through 2019. We searched six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, JSTOR, and Sociological Abstracts) to identify English language, peer-reviewed journal articles reporting findings from empirical studies with an explicit focus on the experiences and perceived impact of equal marriage rights among sexual minority adults. We found 59 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Studies identified positive psychosocial impacts of same-sex marriage (e.g., increased social acceptance, reduced stigma) across individual, interpersonal (dyad, family), community (sexual minority), and broader societal levels. Studies also found that, despite equal marriage rights, sexual minority stigma persists across these levels. Only a few studies examined differences by sex, and findings were mixed. Research to date has several limitations; for example, it disproportionately represents samples from the U.S. and White populations, and rarely examines differences by sexual or gender identity or other demographic characteristics. There is a need for additional research on the impact of equal marriage rights and same-sex marriage on the health and well-being of diverse sexual minorities across the globe",
