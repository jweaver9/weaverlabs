Ball*INTRODUCTIONWhen Richard Loving and Mildred Jeter drove from their hometown ofCentral Point, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., on June 2, 1958, in order toget married, Mildred was several months pregnant.1 Later that year-a fewweeks before the couple pled guilty to having violated Virginia'santimiscegenation law-Mildred gave birth to a baby girl.2 Richard andMildred had two more children, a son born in 1959 and a second daughterborn a year after that.3The legal commentary on Loving v. Virginia usually does not discuss thefact that the couple had children. 4 In some ways, this is not surprisinggiven that their status as parents was not directly relevant to either theirviolation of the Virginia statute, or to their subsequent constitutionalchallenge to that law. Concerns about the creation of interracial children,however, were one of the primary reasons why antimiscegenation lawswere first enacted in colonial America and why they were later adopted andretained by many states. It is not possible, in other words, to understandfully the historical roots and purposes of antimiscegenation laws without anassessment of the role that concerns related to interracial children played intheir enactment and enforcement.* Weiss Family Distinguished Faculty Scholar and Professor of Law, Penn State DickinsonSchool of Law (presently); Professor of Law and Justice Frederick Lacey Scholar, RutgersSchool of Law-Newark (beginning in the fall of 2008).

Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967).2733FORDHAMLA W REVIEWThe offspring of interracial unions were threatening to whites primarilybecause they blurred the lines between what many of them understood to bea naturally superior white race and a naturally inferior black race. As longas there was a clear distinction between the two racial categories-in otherwords, as long as the two categories could be thought to be mutuallyexclusive-then the hierarchical racial regimes represented first by slavery,and later by legal segregation, could be more effectively defended. 5The existence of interracial children destabilized and threatened theunderstanding of racial groups as essentialized categories that existed priorto, and independent of, human norms and understandings. To put itdifferently, interracial children showed that racial categories, seeminglydistinct and immutable, were instead highly malleable. Therefore, from awhite supremacy perspective, it was important to try to deter the creation ofinterracial children as much as possible, and the ban on interracial marriagewas a crucial means to attaining that goal.Although it is possible to disagree on how much progress we have madeas a society in de-essentializing race, it is (or it should be) clear that anessentialized and static understanding of race is both descriptively andnormatively inconsistent with the multicultural American society in whichwe live. In fact, it would seem that we have made more progress in de-essentializing race than we have in de-essentializing sex/gender.6 One of5. See infra Part I.6. The term \"sex\" is usually understood to capture what can be thought of as the natural(or biological) differences between men and women, while \"gender\" is usually taken to referto those cultural norms and expectations that accompany (and constitute) a male or femaleidentity. See Francisco Valdes, Queers, Sissies, Dykes, and Tomboys: Deconstructing theConflation of \"Sex,\" \"Gender,\" and \"Sexual Orientation\" in Euro-American Law andSociety, 83 Cal. L. Rev. 1, 21 (1995) (\"[S]ex denotes bio-physical aspects of personhoodassociated with 'man' and 'woman' while gender denotes the social constructionsunderstood as 'male' and 'female' or 'masculine' and 'feminine.\"'). I agree, however, withthose commentators who argue that the disaggregation of \"sex\" from \"gender\" often helps toshield sex-based distinctions from critique and analysis. As Professor Katherine Frankeeloquently writes,In many cases, biology operates as the excuse or cover for social practices thathierarchize individual members of the social category \"man\" over individualmembers of the social category \"woman.\" In the end, biology or anatomy serve asmetaphors for a kind of inferiority that characterizes society's view of women.Katherine M. Franke, The Central Mistake of Sex Discrimination Law: The Disaggregationof Sex from Gender, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 3 (1995); see also David B. Cruz, DisestablishingSex and Gender, 90 Cal. L. Rev. 997, 1008 (2002) (\"Too often... the history of sex/genderclassification in the United States has been marked by the displacement of humanresponsibility for normative judgments to 'facts' of Nature.\").My discussion in this essay of questions related to sex and gender revolve around theintersection of marriage and parenting. In my estimation, it is unhelpful in this context todisaggregate \"sex\" from \"gender\" because the distinct cultural expectations of mothers andfathers (i.e., issues of \"gender\") are inextricably linked to what are largely taken to be naturalor intrinsic differences (i.e., issues of \"sex\") between men and women. In fact, I haveelsewhere explained how opponents of parenting by lesbians and gay men often conflatesupposedly sex-specific and natural parenting attributes of men and women with externallyimposed social norms and expectations that assign distinct roles and responsibilities to maleand female parents. See Carlos A. Ball, Lesbian and Gay Families: Gender Nonconformity2734 [Vol. 76THE BLURRING OF THE LINESthe best examples of this difference in progress is that while we no longer,as a legal matter, think of the intersection of race and marriage inessentialized ways, legal arguments against same-sex marriage are still verymuch grounded in an essentialized (and binary) understanding ofsex/gender. 7The conservative critique of same-sex marriage is premised on the ideathat men and women are different in essential and complementary ways andthat these differences justify the denial of marriage to same-sex couples. 8One of the most important of these differences relate to the raising ofchildren. The reasoning-which is found in the arguments of conservativecommentators, 9 in the briefs of states defending same-sex marriage bans,' 0and in some of the judicial opinions upholding those bans 1-is that there issomething unique to women as mothers and something (separately) uniqueto men as fathers that makes different-sex couples able to parent in certainvaluable ways that same-sex couples cannot.These arguments continue to resonate legally and politically because ourlaws and culture continue to think about sex/gender in essentialized andbinary ways. In fact, one of the reasons why same-sex marriage is sothreatening to so many is that the raising of children by same-sex couplesblurs the boundaries of seemingly preexisting and static sex/gendercategories in the same way that the progeny of interracial unions blurseemingly preexisting and static racial categories.and the Implications of Difference, 31 Cap. U. L. Rev. 691, 708-20 (2003); see also infranote 100 (explaining how the frequent and simultaneous deployment of procreation-basedarguments and dual-gender parenting-based arguments against same-sex marriage conflatesthe concepts of \"sex\" and \"gender\"). It is for this reason that in this essay I use the term\"sex/gender\" rather than (1) use \"sex\" and \"gender\" interchangeably, or (2) use both wordsseparately to capture potentially different meanings.7. The way in which society treats and regulates transgendered and intersexedindividuals also contributes to the reification of sex/gender labels as essentialized, natural,and predetermined categories. In fact, Marie-Amlie George has analogized between theways in which mulattoes in the American antebellum South challenged an essentialized andbinary understanding of race and the ways in which intersexed individuals in contemporaryAmerica challenge an essentialized and binary understanding of sex/gender. See Marie-Am~lie George, The Modern Mulatto: A Comparative Analysis of the Social and LegalPositions of Mulattoes in the Antebellum South and the Intersex in Contemporary America,15 Colum. J. Gender & L. 665, 679 (2006) (\"Similar to mulattoes, the intersex are notaccepted as a third or variant category, but rather are altered so as to fit within preconceivednotions of what sex is and should be.\"). George suggests that[o]ne of the reasons why race [today] may be accepted as constructed, while sexcontinues to be seen as fixed, is that racial fluidity is more visible. Variations inskin color and tone are readily perceptible, while ambiguities in genitalia are easilyhidden. This helps explain why sexual binaries have not been questioned untilrecently, while racial categories have been suspect for decades.Id. at 666 n.3.8. See infra notes 99-113 and accompanying text.9.

See infra notes 99, 106 and accompanying text.2008] 2735FORDHAM LA W REVIEWIn Part I of this essay, I trace the historical roots of antimiscegenationlaws with a particular focus on children. In doing so, I focus primarily onpre-revolutionary Virginia because that colony had the earliest and mostcomprehensive regulation of interracial intimacy and of the children thatresulted from it. As I explain, the actual prohibition against interracialmarriage in colonial Virginia was only one part of a complex andinterlocking set of regulations that sought to cope with the growing numberof individuals who did not naturally fit the category of either white or black.In Part II, I draw a connection between the old arguments againstinterracial unions and contemporary arguments against same-sex marriages,again with a particular focus on children. My contention is that bothantimiscegenation statutes and bans against same-sex marriage have beenused to construct and reify essentialized and dualistic understandings ofrace and sex/gender. 12Finally, in Part III, I critique the holding of many courts that Loving v.Virginia does not apply to the question of whether bans on same-sexmarriage constitute impermissible forms of sex/gender discrimination. Inparticular, I question these courts' conclusion that the old antimiscegenationstatutes that applied equally to whites and blacks are distinguishable fromthe contemporary same-sex marriage bans that apply equally to men andwomen because, while the former laws were grounded in racial prejudice,the latter are not based on sex/gender prejudice. In doing so, I critique thecontention, frequently advanced by states, that the bans against same-sexmarriage are constitutional because they help provide children with optimalhome environments.I. ANTIMISCEGENATION LAWS AND CHILDRENIt is interesting to note that the colony of Virginia, in the seventeenthcentury, thought it necessary to address the legal status of interracialchildren three decades before it sought to condemn interracial marriage.13In Virginia, prior to the 1660s, there was no explicit regulation of interracialintimacy. 14 Fornication was a crime, but before the 1660s, black-whitefornication was treated in the same way as was white-white fornication. 1512. Andrew Koppelman has noted the psychological and sociological similaritiesbetween racism and the antimiscegenation taboo, on the one hand, and sexism and thehomosexuality taboo, on the other. See Andrew Koppelman, Why Discrimination AgainstLesbians and Gay Men Is Sex Discrimination, 69 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 197, 220-73 (1994).Although Koppelman's analysis is extensive and sophisticated, he does not, as I do in thisessay, explore the ways in which the purported links between marital bans (both interracialand same-sex) and children have been used to reify essentialized and dualisticunderstandings of race and sex/gender.13. See Peter Wallenstein, Tell the Court I Love My Wife: Race, Marriage, and Law-An American History 15 (2002).14. There is evidence of public condemnation of those who engaged in fornication priorto 1662 in Virginia. It is unclear, however, whether racial factors added to the intensity ofthat condemnation. See A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. & Barbara K. Kopytoff, Racial Purityand Interracial Sex in the Law of Colonial and Antebellum Virginia, 77 Geo. L.J. 1967, 1989(1989) (noting that \"[i]n Virginia before the 1660s... [tihere were several instances of2736 [Vol. 76THE BLURRING OF THE LINESInterracial intimacy as such became problematic when it led to the birthof a growing number of interracial children. It was important, in a societywhere slavery was increasingly becoming entrenched, to determine thestatus of those children. In 1662, therefore, the Virginia Assembly enacteda law that made the status of interracial children dependent on the status oftheir mothers. 16 If the mother was a slave, then her children would also beslaves, regardless of the race of the father. If the mother was a freewoman-whether white, of mixed race, or black-then her children wouldbe free as well.The Virginia statute was a departure from English law, which made thestatus of children dependent on the status of their fathers. 17 Althoughprecise numbers are difficult to establish, it is likely that a majority ofinterracial children born in seventeenth-century Virginia were conceived bywhite fathers and black mothers, with most of the latter being slaves.18 Ifthe colony had followed the English rule, interracial children conceived bywhite fathers would have been deemed to be free even if their mothers hadbeen slaves. This was problematic for white Virginians, both because itwould have significantly increased the number of free blacks (who mightforge alliances with slaves) 19 and because it would deny an additionalpublic condemnation of couples who engaged in interracial sex, but the importance of therace factor was unclear\").15. Id. at 1990-92 (providing several examples of the equal treatment).16. Negro Womens Children to Serve According to the Condition of the Mother[hereinafter Negro Womens Children], in 2 The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of Allthe Laws of Virginia 170 (William Waller Hening ed., 1823) [hereinafter Laws of Virginia].\"Whereas some doubts have arisen whether children got by any Englishman [i.e., white man]upon a negro woman should be slave or ffree, Be it therefore enacted and declared by thispresent grand assembly, that all children borne in this country shalbe held bond or free onlyaccording to the condition of the mother....\" Id. (emphasis omitted). Higginbotham andKopytoff note that \"[t]he law of the inheritance of slave status was a response to the questionof how to classify the children of white men and slave women.\" Higginbotham & Kopytoff,supra note 14, at 2006.17. Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1971 n.20.18. Joel Williamson, New People: Miscegenation and Mulattoes in the United States 8(1980) (noting that children of slave mothers constituted \"a large proportion (perhaps morethan half) of the mulattoes in Virginia\"). Williamson suggests that, unlike in later centuries,the majority of interracial children born in Virginia in the seventeenth century wereconceived as a result of sexual contact between white male servants (both voluntary andinvoluntary) and black female slaves, as opposed to as a result of sexual relationshipsbetween white men and their slaves. Id. at 7; see also Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone:The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America 44-45 (1998) (\"Bastardy lists suggestthat the largest source of mixed-race children in the seventeenth-century Chesapeake was notthe imposition of white planter men on black slave women but the relations of black slavesand white servants.\"). But see Charles Frank Robinson 11, Dangerous Liaisons: Sex andLove in the Segregated South 3 (2003) (noting that, in seventeenth-century Virginia, \"mostinterracial sexual relations involved intercourse between white masters and slave women\").19. See Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1996 (noting the concern of whiteVirginians with \"the dangers in the possible alliances of free negroes and mulattoes withslaves\").2008] 2737FORDHAM LA W REVIEWsupply of labor to the owners of the black mothers.20 In contrast, a rule thatassigned to interracial children the status of their mothers aided in theentrenchment and expansion of slavery. 21The first step that the Virginia Assembly took in 1662 with respect tomiscegenation, then, was to link the free or slave status of interracialchildren to that of their mothers. The second step it took-through the verysame statute-was to address, for the first time, the issue of interracial sexby doubling the punishment for interracial fornication.22 The fact that thenew interracial fornication provision was part of the statute that assigned tointerracial children the status of their mothers, strongly suggests that thelegislators saw the problem as being not \"simply the act of interracial sexitself, but [also] its likely result: mulatto children.\" 23Although many interracial children born in seventeenth-century Virginiawere conceived by white men and black women, not all of them were.Some resulted from sexual contact between white women and black men.20. See id. at 1994 n.127 (\"The early uncertainty over the status of blacks was beingresolved in ways that kept increasing numbers of them in lifetime servitude and sealed thesame fate for most of their children.\").21. See id. at 2006 (noting that the 1662 statute \"provided slaveowners with easy andcheap ways to increase the number of slaves they held\"). In addition, as a result of theenactment of the 1662 statute, \"[w]hite men could now be certain that their sexual behavioracross the color line would not threaten the institution of slavery.\" Robinson, supra note 18,at 3.22. The statute stated \"that if any christian [i.e., white person] shall committ ffornicationwith a negro man or woman, hee or shee soe offending shall pay double the ffines imposedby the former act.\" Negro Womens Children, supra note 16, at 170. The fine called for by\"the former act\" was five hundred pounds of tobacco. Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note14, at 1993.Notice that the statute punished the white party but not the black one. For the next twohundred years, Virginia law sought to punish only the white person for engaging in sexualintimacy with a black person. It was not until 1878 that Virginia punished both the whiteand the black parties for violating its antimiscegenation law. See Wallenstein, supra note 13,at 100. To a certain extent, it makes sense that the law did not punish slaves for engaging inintimate relationships with whites. As Higginbotham and Kopytoff note,[i]t might have been seen as bad policy or unreasonable to punish a slave foracquiescing to the demands of his or her master, even to demands for illicitbehavior. In addition, many of the usual punishments were meaningless whenimposed on slaves or would result in punishing their masters. Years could not beadded to life-long servitude; slaves could not be fined if they owned no property;and imprisonment would have deprived their masters of their work.Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 2000 (footnote omitted).It is less clear why the law would not have sought to punish free blacks and mulattoes forengaging in sexual relationships with whites. Higginbotham and Kopytoff suggest that[p]erhaps whites were so secure in their position of power and superiority that theyassumed such relations would not occur unless initiated by whites. After the earlyyears of the colony, as the lines of the racial caste system hardened, the freedom ofchoice of blacks was ignored in this as in so many other areas of life.Id. at 2001.23. Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1994; see also Jason A. Gillmer, Suingfor Freedom: Interracial Sex, Slave Law, and Racial Identity in the Post-revolutionary andAntebellum South, 82 N.C. L. Rev. 535, 559 (2004) (\"If interracial intimacy was troubling tomany because of its sheer physical aspects,.., it also was troubling because of the inevitableproduct.\").[Vol. 762738THE BLURRING OF THE LINESThis second category of interracial children presented its own set ofchallenges to colonial leaders for two reasons. First, these children, as theoffspring of white women, were not categorized as slaves regardless of howdark the color of their skin might be. 24 These children, therefore, erodedthe seemingly natural link between blackness and slavery. 25 Second, whilewhite Virginians were largely indifferent to the issue of black womenhaving interracial children (as long as the children of slaves were alsodeemed to be slaves, as called for by the 1662 law), 26 they were deeplytroubled by the notion of white women having interracial children. It waswhite women (and not white men) who were charged with the responsibilityof keeping the white race \"pure.\" 27  White women were understood, ineffect, to be the guarantors of racial purity, and, as such, had to be punishedwhen they transgressed by engaging in sexual relationships that crossedracial lines. 28For three decades after the enactment of the 1662 statute, the only legaldisincentive for white women to engage in sexual relationships with blackmen was the existence of the fornication statute that doubled thepunishment for interracial sex. By definition, however, the crime offornication did not apply if the individuals in question were married to eachother. And, indeed, there are reported cases of white women marryingblack men in seventeenth-century Virginia.29As a result, by the end of the century, the Virginia Assembly concludedthat there was a need for additional regulation that would stronglydiscourage interracial unions and the children that might result from them.In 1691, therefore, the assembly enacted its first interracial marriage law, adescendant of which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court almost24. See supra note 16 and accompanying text.25. As Martha Hodes notes,When white women had children with black men, two important social categorieswere eroded: racial categories were eroded because the children would be ofmixed European and African ancestry, and categories of slavery and freedom wereeroded because free people of African ancestry endangered the equation ofblackness and slavery.Martha Hodes, White Women, Black Men: Illicit Sex in the Nineteenth-Century South 4(1997).26. See Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1997 (\"Black women whoproduced mulatto children were not seen as making the same direct assault on white racialpurity; they were unable to produce white children and thus did not affect the white race.There was no comparable concern over their 'lightening' of the Negro race.\").27. See id. at 2007 (\"Once Virginians had made the decision to classify mulattoes withblacks, the mulatto child of a white mother was an assault on racial purity.\").28. See Randall Kennedy, Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption221 (2003) (\"White women were anointed as the primary gatekeepers of white racial purity,and as such, they became the members of the white community who could, with self-evidentjustice, be most severely penalized for racial transgressions.\").29. See Robinson, supra note 18, at 8 (\"On Virginia's eastern shore between 1664 and1677, five of the ten households headed by free black men seem to have also had whitewomen present as wives.\").2008] 2739FORDHAM LAW REVIEWthree hundred years later in Loving v. Virginia.30 The new law wasparticularly critical of interracial marriages between white women andnonwhite men. In expressing its disapproval of that category ofrelationships, the legislature noted that the statutory proscription wasrequired to \"prevent ... that abominable mixture and spurious issue whichhereafter may encrease in this dominion, as well by negroes, mulattoes, andIndians intermarrying with English, or other white women, as by theirunlawfull accompanying with one another.\" 31 The language of the statuteshows that what motivated the legislators to condemn interracial marriageswas an objection to the offspring (i.e., the \"abominable mixture andspurious issue\") that resulted from the unions of white women andnonwhite men.Although \"it was the prospect of white women mating with nonwhitemen that called forth the strong language\" contained in the text of the law,32the statute called for the lifetime banishment from the colony of any whiteperson who married a nonwhite individual, regardless of whether the formerwas a man or a woman. 33 Despite the fact that the statute, in theory,30. 388 U.S. 1 (1967). The antimiscegenation provision was part of a broader statute-called \"An Act for Suppressing Outlying Slaves\"-that sought to deter alliances betweenfree and enslaved blacks. Another provision of the statute, for example, imposed on ownerswho wanted to free their slaves the obligation of paying for the costs of transporting thembeyond the boundaries of the colony. See Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1996.As Higginbotham and Kopytoff note, however, \"[W]hite Virginians seemed not torealize... that they had greatly increased the danger of alliance by classifying most mixedrace individuals with blacks rather than with whites in terms of their legal rights.\" Id. at1996-97.31. An Act for Suppressing Outlying Slaves, in 3 Laws of Virginia, supra note 16, at 86,86-87 (emphasis added). In 1705, the legislature amended the statute in order to permit themarriage between a white person and a Native American. See id. at 453. In the eighteenthand early nineteenth centuries, some legislators proposed bills-most of which were notenacted-to try to encourage marriages between whites and Native Americans. \"Themotivation behind these bills was probably a desire to mitigate the danger of Indian attackson the frontier.\" Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1996 n. 133 (citation omitted).32. Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1995. In 1705, the Virginia Assemblychanged the punishment for entering into an interracial marriage from lifetime banishment tosix months in prison for the white party. Wallenstein, supra note 13, at 18. It has beensuggested that this new penalty was a \"more effective deterrent to racial intermarriageamong ordinary people,\" and one that did not, after the period of incarceration wascompleted, deprive the colony of laborers. Edmund S. Morgan, American Slavery AmericanFreedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia 335 (1975).The 1705 statute alsoprotect[ed] the economic investment of slave owners and denied the human rightsof the slave. If a master killed his slave during correction, it would not be afelony; any Negro, mulatto, or Indian who struck a white person would get 30lashes. Slaves could not travel, own cattle, or bear arms. In order to make anexample of them, runaways could be dismembered.Karen Woods Weierman, \"For the Better Government of Servants and Slaves \": The Law ofSlavery and Miscegenation, 24 Legal Stud. F. 133, 137 (2000). The 1705 amendment, then,like its 1691 counterpart, see supra note 31, was part of a broader statute that sought toentrench and protect the institution of slavery.33. 3 Laws of Virginia, supra note 16, at 87. \"Be it enacted.., that.. . whatsoeverEnglish or other white man or woman being free shall intermarry with a negroe, mulatto, or[Vol. 762740THE BLURRING OF THE LINESapplied to all whites, it was women, as a practical matter, who were likelyto be prosecuted for violating antimiscegenation laws. 34 Furthermore, alsoas a practical matter, the lifetime banishment of the mother meant thelifetime (or at least the long) banishment of interracial children born to her.While the interracial children of slave mothers were dealt with by enslavingthem, the interracial children of (married) white mothers were dealt with bybanishing them from the colony.35There were reasons other than a specific concern about white womenhaving interracial children that led legislators to condemn strongly theirinterracial relationships. One of those had to do with the unique revulsionfelt by many white Virginians at the very idea of sexual intimacy betweenwhite women and black men, a revulsion that was not present when whitemen were known to have had sexual relationships with black women.Sexual relationships between white women and black men reinforced tworelated stereotypes, that of the latter as \"savagely sexual\" 36 creatures andthat of the former as sexually vulnerable beings who needed the protectionafforded by white men. 37 Some commentators have also argued that therestrictions on white female sexuality were motivated by the perceived needto keep the relatively small number of white women sexually available tothe much larger number of white men who lived in the colony at the time.38It does appear, however, that the concern about white women giving birthto interracial children was the primary motivation behind Virginia's firstinterracial marriage law. As Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., and BarbaraK. Kopytoff note, \"The legislators seemed to feel a particular distaste thatwhite women, who could be producing white children, were producingmulattoes [instead].\"'39That the existence of interracial children born to white mothers was theprimary concern behind the 1691 antimiscegenation law is supported notonly by the statutory language already noted,40 but also by two otherprovisions of the same statute that dealt with interracial children born fromIndian man or woman bond or free shall within three months after such marriage be banishedand removed from this dominion forever ...\" Id.

The first provision required white women whohad a so-called \"bastard child\" to pay church wardens fifteen pounds withinone month of the baby's birth.4' If the mother did not have the money, thenthe law authorized church wardens to auction off her services for fiveyears. 42 And, as if this was not enough of a disincentive for white womento have interracial children, a second provision authorized church wardensto take the children away from their mothers and auction them off asservants until they attained the age of thirty.4341. 3 Laws of Virginia, supra note 16, at 87. The law did not punish black women whobore mulatto children, suggesting once again that white Virginians were not particularlytroubled by the idea of sexual intimacy between white men and black women. White womenwho had illegitimate children as a result of having sexual contact with white men were alsosubject to criminal penalties, but they were considerably less harsh than those that appliedwhen the fornication led to the birth of an interracial child. For example,a law enacted in 1696 provided that if an indentured servant woman had a bastard(presumably not a mulatto), she had to give only one extra year of service to hermaster, in addition to a fine for fornication, which was \"five hundred pounds oftobacco and casque\" or 25 lashes.Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1996 n.138 (citing An Act for Punishment ofFfornication and Seaverall Other Sins and Offences, in 3 Laws of Virginia, supra note 16, at137, 139-40).

In 1664, Marylandbecame the first colony to adopt a law condemning interracial marriage, although thatprovision only applied to unions between white women and black men. See Weierman,supra note 32, at 141. The statute expressed the legislature's disapproval of \"freeborneEnglishwomen [who were] forgettful of their free Condition and to the disgrace of ourNation doe intermarry with Negro slaves.\" Peter W.

In 1692, the Maryland legislaturealso prohibited marriages between white men and black women, id. at 142, and required thatwhite women who had illegitimate interracial children be indentured as servants for sevenyears, Bardaglio, supra, at 114.

Weierman, supra note 32, at 142.It was not just southern colonies that enacted laws regulating interracial sexuality and thechildren resulting therefrom. Under a Pennsylvania law dating to the 1720s, for example, afree black man who married a white woman could be sentenced to serve as a slave for the[Vol. 762742THE BLURRING OF THE LINESIt is worth emphasizing that the legislative scheme created by theVirginia Assembly related to interracial children born out of wedlocktargeted only white women (and their children).44 The statute did notimpose criminal penalties on white men who had children with blackwomen. The law also did not directly penalize the nonwhite fathers ofinterracial children,though it surely broke up any family there might have been. The fatherwas important to the law because, regardless of whether he was free orslave, he was nonwhite and had fathered a child by a white woman. Butthe penalties were imposed on the woman and the child. 45It is also important to keep in mind how the actual prohibition againstinterracial marriage in colonial Virginia was only one component of acomplex and interlocking set of regulations that sought to cope with thegrowing number of individuals who did not easily fit the category of eitherwhite or black. Indeed, there came a point in the late seventeenth centurywhen colonial leaders felt it necessary to use a rather comprehensivestatutory regime to try to bring order to the racial confusion created by theexistence of interracial children. As Higginbotham and Kopytoff note,these children were perceived to be \"anomalies. They simply did not fitinto the whites' vision of the natural order of things: a great chain of Beingcomprised of fixed links, not of infinite gradations. Things which do not fitinto the perceived natural order are seen as unnatural and often asdangerous and 'abominable.\"' 46rest of his life. Wallenstein, supra note 13, at 40. And, as in Virginia and Maryland, childrenof unmarried interracial couples could be sold as servants for the first three decades of theirlives. Id.Although Pennsylvania repealed its antimiscegenation law shortly before Independence,Massachusetts reenacted the colonial version of its antimiscegenation law after it became astate. Id. at 41. The original antimiscegenation law enacted by colonial Massachusetts in1705 echoed the language used by the Virginia statute of 1691, see supra note 31 andaccompanying text, calling for the prevention of \"a Spurious and Mixt Issue,\" Wallenstein,supra note 13, at 42. For its part, North Carolina's antimiscegenation law of 1741 quotedverbatim from the Virginia law of 1691, condemning interracial marriages because they ledto an \"abominable Mixture and spurious issue.\" Id.44. Kathleen Brown has documented the increase in prosecutions for interracial bastardyafter the enactment of the 1691 statute. In a study of court records from three Virginiacounties, Brown found that such prosecutions went from less than ten percent of the cases inthe 1680s, to seventeen percent in the 1690s, to nearly thirty percent by the 1700s. Brown,supra note 34, at 198-99.45. Wallenstein, supra note 13, at 17. The Virginia antimiscegenation statute remainedlargely unchanged during the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century.In 1849, however, the Virginia legislature for the first time declared that all interracialmarriages were void ab initio. See Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1996 n.135(citing Va. Code ch. 109, § 1 (1849)). Prior to 1849, while the white spouse in an interracialmarriage was subject to incarceration and a fine, the marriage itself was not invalid. The factthat the marriage remained valid was important not only for the couple, but also for thechildren, who were spared the additional social and legal disabilities associated withillegitimacy. Beginning in 1849, however, all of the children of interracial couples inVirginia were deemed illegitimate as a matter of law.46. Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 2005 (footnote omitted).20081 2743FORDHAM LA W REVIEWInterracial children challenged the idea of racial categories as God-given,natural, static, and unchanging. The law was used as a way to try to bringback into clear focus the lines between the races-lines that were becomingincreasingly blurred due to the growing number of individuals who wereneither entirely white nor entirely black.Keeping these lines of demarcation clear was important not only forideological reasons, that is, for reasons that went to the notion that whitepeople were naturally superior to blacks, but also for practical ones. Theinstitution of slavery depended on a clear differentiation between the tworacial groups.47  The existence of a category of individuals that fellsomewhere in the middle undermined the (perverse) logic of a slaveryregime that linked skin color with the status of being either a free person ora slave.In the seventeenth century, it was relatively easy to divide non-NativeAmericans into three racial categories, namely, whites, blacks, andmulattoes. Matters quickly became more complicated, however. As thedecades (and eventually the centuries) progressed, the antimiscegenationregime in Virginia and in other southern states came under considerablepressure from the simple and inalterable fact that each successivegeneration of racial intermixing led to ever-increasing degrees of racialgradations and permutations.48  The real world, in other words, wasshowing racial groups to be part of a continuum rather than constitutingdistinct and separate categories.49 The law was used to try to police theboundaries between racial groups, but there was only so much that the lawcould do.47. See id. (\"[T]he idea of a racially based system of slavery depended on a clearseparation of the races.\"); Winthrop D. Jordan, White over Black: American AttitudesToward the Negro, 1550-1812, at 178 (1968) (\"For the separation of slaves from free mendepended on a clear demarcation of the races, and the presence of mulattoes blurred thisessential distinction.\").48. For example, the number of so-called mulattoes in the United States the year that theCivil War began was \"more than a half million people--or twelve percent of the people ofcolor .... Fifteen percent of the people of color in Virginia were listed [in the 1860 census]as mulattoes, and the number rose as high as twenty percent in Missouri and Kentucky.\"Gillmer, supra note 23, at 558-59 (footnotes omitted).49. In 1806, the Virginia Supreme Court held that the burden of proof in slave freedomsuits would be allocated according to racial appearance. Hudgins v. Wrights, 11 Va. (1 Hen.& M.) 134, 140 (1806). If the plaintiffs appeared to be white or Native American, they werepresumed to be free. On the other hand, if they appeared to be black, they were presumed tobe slaves. Id. This was not an easy rule to apply, however, leading one of the judges on thecourt to complain that \"[w]hen . . . these races become intermingled, it is difficult, if notimpossible, to say from inspection only, which race predominates in the offspring.\" Id. at141 (Roane, J., concurring); see also Ariela J. Gross, Litigating Whiteness: Trials of RacialDetermination in the Nineteenth-Century South, 108 Yale L.J. 109, 111-12 (1998) (\"Despitethe efforts of legislatures to reduce racial identities to a binary system, and of judges to insistthat determining race was a matter of common sense, Southern communities harboreddisagreement, suspicion, and conflict.., over who was black and who was white ... \").[Vol. 762744THE BL URRING OF THE LINESStarting in 1785, Virginia law presumed that someone who had less thanone-fourth African ancestry was \"white.\" 50 By the early twentieth century,however, that definition had become insufficiently restrictive from a whitesupremacy perspective because it was perceived to permit too much racialintermixing. In 1910, therefore, the legislature changed the definition of awhite person to someone who had less than one-sixteenth Africanancestry. 51Virginia's quest for racial purity... [led it] to make the definition of awhite person more exclusive, a change that would make it much moredifficult for a person of both African and European ancestry to qualify formarriage to someone who satisfied the more rigid requirement as a whiteperson.52After only a few years, Virginia legislators came to see even this new, morerestrictive definition of who qualified to be deemed legally white as beingtoo broad. As a result, in 1924 they enacted a statute-appropriately butperversely named the \"Act to Preserve Racial Integrity\"-requiring that inorder for individuals to qualify for Caucasian status, they could not haveany traceable nonwhite ancestry. 53 This meant that a person with a trace ofnonwhite ancestry was now legally prohibited from marrying any of theshrinking percentage of individuals who could still be deemed white as amatter of law. 54The moral untenability of the antimiscegenation regime was, of course,obvious from its inception. The practical untenability of that regime wasalso obvious by the time the Virginia legislature adopted the so-called \"one-drop\" rule in 1924. The adoption of that rule was nothing less than a50. Wallenstein, supra note 13, at 19. The legal definition of a white person was animplied one. The 1785 law explicitly defined a \"mulatto\" as someone who had at least one-fourth African ancestry. Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1978. By implication,therefore, anyone with less than one-fourth of such ancestry was considered legally white.An earlier statute, enacted in 1705, defined a \"mulatto\" as someone who was of mixed-raceand had at least one-eighth African ancestry. Wallenstein, supra note 13, at 17. Virginia wasone of two colonies (the other was North Carolina) that sought to assign racial identitythrough a statute. Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note 14, at 1976 & n.42.51. Wallenstein, supra note 13, at 137. As with the 1785 law, the 1910 statute provideda legal definition of a white person by implication, that is, through a codification of whoqualified as a \"mulatto.\"52. Id.53. Id. at 139.54. The 1924 statute constituted the first time that the Virginia legislature explicitlydefined who qualified to be white as a matter of law. Higginbotham & Kopytoff, supra note14, at 1980 n.61. The law exempted from the \"one-drop\" rule those who had one-sixteenthor less of Native American ancestry. This exception, known as the \"Pocahontas exception,\"was an effort to accommodate those \"white Virginians [who] had long admitted, evencelebrated, their descent from the seventeenth-century union between Pocahantas and JohnRolfe.\" Wallenstein, supra note 13, at 139 (internal quotation marks omitted). For adiscussion of the Pocahontas exception and, more generally, of the regulation (andsometimes promotion) of intimate relationships between whites and Native Americans, seegenerally Kevin Noble Maillard, The Pocahontas Exception: The Exemption of AmericanIndian Ancestry from Racial Purity Law, 12 Mich. J. Race & L. 351 (2007).2008] 2745FORDHAM LA W REVIEWdesperate attempt by legislators to protect the ideal of a \"pure\" white race.55However, this was a hopeless endeavor because, ironically, the more thelegislature restricted who qualified as \"white,\" the greater racial intermixingit allowed. For example, while someone who was three-quarters whitewould not have been allowed to marry a black person at the beginning ofthe twentieth century, that person would have been permitted to do so after1924 because he or she (despite being three-quarters white) was nowconsidered to be a nonwhite individual.Virginia was not alone in statutorily changing racial definitions in orderto try to cope with the growing racial intermixing that was taking placefrom one generation to the next. Several other southern states did thesame.56 \"Every time a state moved the boundary that separated one racialidentity from another, it demonstrated how flexible the legal definition was,and how arbitrary was the entire enterprise of legislating identity.\" 57Despite the moral and practical untenability of antimiscegenation laws,they remained in place in sixteen states (all of them in the South) by thetime the Supreme Court decided Loving v. Virginia.5 8 In many ways, theargument used in support of antimiscegenation laws in the second half ofthe twentieth century was essentially the same that had been used all along,namely, that racial groups were God-given and natural categories, whichneeded to be protected against the perceived threat represented by racialintermixing. 5955. Randall Kennedy explains the motivation behind the adoption of the \"one-drop\" ruleas follows:The one-drop rule at once precluded the formal recognition of intermediate racialcastes, assuaged anxieties about the perceived loss of racial purity, facilitatedracial-group solidarities, and stigmatized any form of white-black amalgamation.It also vividly reflected and animated Negrophobia by suggesting, essentially, thatno matter how white a person might appear, even the tiniest dab of Negro ancestrywas sufficiently contaminating to make him a \"nigger.\"Kennedy, supra note 28, at 223.56. In 1927, the Georgia legislature amended the definition of \"persons of color\" forpurposes of its antimiscegenation law. The previous statutory provision had defined suchpersons as those who were at least one-eighth black. The new law defined such persons as\"having any ascertainable trace of nonwhite ancestry.\" Wallenstein, supra note 13, at 137(internal quotation marks omitted). In order to qualify as \"Caucasian,\" individuals needed tohave \"no ascertainable trace of Negro, African, West Indian, Asiatic Indian, Mongolian,Japanese, or Chinese blood in their veins.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).For its part, Alabama in 1907 changed the definition of a \"mulatto\" from someone whohad at least one-eighth African ancestry-a definition that had been on the books for half acentury-to someone who had at least one thirty-second of such ancestry. Id. at 141.Twenty years later, Alabama changed the law again to define a \"negro\" as a person who\"descended on the part of the father or mother from negro ancestors, without reference to orlimit of time or number of generations removed.\" Id.

The trial judge in Loving upheld the constitutionality of the antimiscegenation statuteby noting,Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placedthem on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement2746 [Vol. 76THE BLURRING OF THE LINESThe Supreme Court had the opportunity to hear an appeal challengingVirginia's antimiscegenation statute a year after it decided Brown v. Boardof Education,60 but the Court refused to hear the case on proceduralgrounds.61 The Court could no longer avoid the issue, however, after theLovings lost their constitutional challenge in the state courts a decade later.Part of the Justices' much-delayed fatal blow to antimiscegenation laws wasundoubtedly normative in nature: by the late 1960s, this remaining vestigeof white supremacy could no longer be made consistent with ourconstitutional values. 62 But I suspect that the opinion can also be explainedby the fact that the Court was responding to the reality of interracialrelationships and to the fact that the concept of racial purity was not onlyfrightening as a normative matter, but was also inconsistent with the realworld as a descriptive one. 63there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the racesshows that he did not intend for the races to mix.Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 3 (1967) (internal quotation marks omitted). Almost acentury earlier, another Virginia judge defended the antimiscegenation law in strikinglysimilar terms:The purity of public morals, the moral and physical development of both races,and the highest advancement of our cherished southern civilization, under whichtwo distinct races are to work out and accomplish the destiny to which theAlmighty has assigned them on this continent-all require that they should be keptdistinct and separate, and that connections and alliances so unnatural that God andnature seem to forbid them, should be prohibited by positive law, and be subject tono evasion.Kinney v. Virginia, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 858, 869 (1878); see also State v. Gibson, 36 Ind. 389,405 (1871) (\"The natural separation of the races is ... an undeniable fact, and all socialorganizations which lead to their amalgamation are repugnant to the law of nature.\").60. 347 U.S. 483 (1954).61. The constitutionality of Virginia's antimiscegenation law came before the Court in1955. The Virginia Supreme Court had rejected a constitutional challenge to that law in acase involving an interracial couple from Virginia who had traveled to North Carolina to getmarried and then returned. Naim, 87 S.E.2d at 750. In a highly unusual move, the U.S.Supreme Court, after hearing oral arguments, ruled that the record in the case was inadequatebecause it was unclear whether the couple were Virginia domiciliaries. Naim v. Naim, 350U.S. 891, 891 (1955). The Court vacated the Virginia Supreme Court's decision, sendingthe case back to that court and ordering it to remand the case to the trial court. Id. TheVirginia Supreme Court refused to do so, ruling that it could not, under Virginia proceduralrules, send the case back to the trial court. See Naim v. Naim, 90 S.E.2d 849, 850 (Va.1956). The litigation came to an end when the U.S. Supreme Court denied a motion to recallthe remand. See Naim v. Naim, 350 U.S. 985, 985 (1956). It seems clear that the Court,dealing with the southern states' political backlash and resistance to Brown, was in no moodto tackle an issue (interracial relationships) that was even more controversial than that of theracial integration of schools. See Philip Elman, The Solicitor General's Office, JusticeFrankfurter, and Civil Rights Litigation, 1946-1960: An Oral History, 100 Harv. L. Rev.817, 846 (1987) (noting that, after the strong resistance to Brown in southern states, \"the lastthing in the world the Justices wanted to deal with at that time was the question of interracialmarriage\").62. This seemed particularly clear after the Court struck down as unconstitutional aFlorida statute that prohibited interracial cohabitation. See McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S.184, 196 (1964).63. After Loving, it took the Court another seventeen years to make it clear that not onlyare race-based marital restrictions unconstitutional, but also that, upon the dissolution of amarriage, it is unconstitutional for courts to award custody on the basis of race. See Palmore2008] 2747FORDHAM LA W REVIEWII. SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BANS AND CHILDRENWhile colonial assemblies, beginning in the seventeenth century, enactedlaws that condemned interracial unions, there were no similar legislativelyexpressed concerns about same-sex relationships as such. Althoughsodomy was proscribed under colonial law, it was a proscription thatapplied primarily to men regardless of the sex/gender of their sexualpartners. 64 Sodomy laws in the seventeenth century reflected society'sgeneral disapproval of nonreproductive and nonmarital sex; they did notrepresent a targeted condemnation of those who had sex with individuals oftheir own sex/gender. 65 Indeed, it was not until the second half of thenineteenth century, more than three hundred years after colonial assembliesv. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 434 (1984). The trial judge in Palmore relied on the social stigmathat accompanied the mother's relationship with a black man to justify taking custody awayfrom her. Id. at 431. The Supreme Court rejected that reasoning, noting famously thatalthough \"[t]he Constitution cannot control ... prejudices[ ,]... neither can it tolerate them.Private biases may be outside of the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly orindirectly, give them effect.\" Id. at 433.Interestingly, some courts have denied gay and lesbian parents custody on the ground thatthird parties are likely to stigmatize the children because of the parents' sexual orientation.For example, the North Dakota Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Jacobson held that in light ofsociety's disapproval of homosexuality, it was not in the best interests of the children to beplaced with their lesbian mother. 314 N.W.2d 78 (N.D. 1981), overruled by Damron v.Damron, 670 N.W.2d 871, 875-76 (N.D. 2003). As the court put it,[W]e cannot lightly dismiss the fact that living in the same house with their motherand her lover may well cause the children to \"suffer from the slings and arrows ofa disapproving society\" to a much greater extent than would an arrangementwherein the children were placed in the custody of their father with visitationrights in the mother.Id. at 81. Other courts, however, have relied on Palmore to reject the proposition that thestigma that society attaches to homosexuality is a valid ground for denying lesbians and gaymen custody of their children. See, e.g., Jacoby v. Jacoby, 763 So. 2d 410, 413 (Fla. Dist. Ct.App. 2000) (\"[E]ven if the [lower] court's comments about the community's beliefs andpossible reactions [to homosexuality] were correct and supported by the evidence in thisrecord, the law cannot give effect to private biases.\" (citing Palmore, 466 U.S. at 433));Inscoe v.

Both formsof intimacy came to be viewed as abominations, that is, as deeply troublingdepartures from the ways in which both God and nature expected humanbeings to use their sexual capabilities. Indeed, it is fair to say that by theearly twentieth century, many Americans were as concerned by same-sexintimacy as they were by interracial intimacy. 68The law, however, did not trouble itself with same-sex relationships inthe same way that it did with interracial ones. It was difficult for interracialcouples to hide their relationships, especially when children were born fromthose unions. In fact, state officials often used the existence of interracialchildren as evidence of a sexual relationship between the adults.69 It wasmuch easier to hide ongoing same-sex relationships-often under theveneer of platonic friendships-than interracial ones. 70 To put it simply,two same-sex partners could walk down the street together withoutattracting much attention as long as they did not express physical affectionfor each other. In contrast, the mere fact that a black man and a whitewoman, for example, had the temerity to walk down the street togetherraised the likelihood of violence and harassment. 71 Interracial relationships,although highly stigmatized, were more visible (and recognizable), andtherefore more vulnerable to explicit social opprobrium and regulation thanwere same-sex relationships.For most of the twentieth century, then, committed same-sexrelationships largely flew under the legal radar. For most of that century,the medical and psychiatric professions deemed homosexuality to be anillness, subject to (often harsh and inhumane) treatment. 72  Law66.

There were, in other words, no regulations akin toantimiscegenation laws, that is, regulations enacted with the explicit intentof condemning same-sex relationships.Indeed, it is clear that when American states first enacted marriageeligibility statutes in the early nineteenth century, there was no intent toexclude or condemn same-sex relationships. 76 Although those statutes(usually implicitly) required prospective spouses to be of differentsexes/genders, there was no real concept of a homosexual identity orrecognition of the existence of ongoing intimate same-sex relationships. Asa result, it cannot be said that the early marriage statutes were aimed atcondemning or discouraging same-sex relationships in the same way thatantimiscegenation laws, by definition, targeted interracial relationships. 77The condemnation of same-sex sex, however, was a different matteraltogether.

Cott, Public Vows: A History of Marriage and theNation 28 (2000).77. This has all changed, of course, in the last few years with the enactment of dozens ofso-called Defense of Marriage Acts, laws that have no purpose other than to deny legalrecognition to same-sex relationships.

The primary rationale relied on by courts inrejecting the claims was that the plaintiffs were seeking a remedy that wasboth legally and definitionally impossible to provide. As the courts saw it,the very definition of marriage required that the two prospective spouses beof different sexes/genders. 82  Whatever it was that the plaintiffs werewickedly and indecently penetrate, in a manner against nature, his or her mouth bycarnal intercourse.Id.

From thisperspective, the waiver of the sex/gender restriction necessarily entails thefundamental alteration of the institution of marriage itself.In the 1990s, when gay litigants once again began challenging theconstitutionality of bans against same-sex marriages, new natural lawtheorists attempted to develop a nontautological explanation of why theinstitution of marriage should be limited to different-sex couples. Thatexplanation was grounded in the notion that there are natural differencesbetween men and women that are complementary and that make theirunions more valuable than those of same-sex couples. 84 One of the mostimportant of those differences relates to sexual and reproductive capabilitiesthat, when joined, lead to the formation of a new life.85Although new natural law theorists gave moral weight to the capability ofdifferent-sex couples to have children, they did not address the connectionbetween dual-gender parenting and the well-being of children. Otherconservative commentators, however, have argued that such parenting isessential in providing children with an optimal home environment. As oneauthor has put it, being raised by different-sex couples is important\"because there are gender-linked differences in child-rearing skills; menand women contribute different (gender-connected) strengths and attributesto their children's development.\"-8683.

Patrick Lee and Robert George explain the argument as follows:In reproductive activity the bodily parts of the male and the bodily parts of thefemale participate in a single action, coitus, which is oriented to reproduction(though not every act of coitus is reproductive), so that the subject of the action isthe male and the female as a unit. Coitus is a unitary action in which the male andthe female become literally one organism. In marital intercourse, this bodily unityis an aspect-indeed, the biological matrix-of the couple's comprehensivemarital communion.Patrick Lee & Robert P.

It wasdifficult enough, in the early 1970s, for some to conceive of same-sexcouples as being eligible to marry, 87 much less to think of them as familialunits that were either capable of or interested in raising children. Beginningin the early 1980s, however, a growing number of lesbians and gay men (inparticular the former) started raising children, many of them doing so ascouples. 88The crucial shift to a child-based legal defense of the same-sex marriagebans came after the Supreme Court of Hawaii held in 1993 that the state'sprohibition against same-sex marriages constituted a sex classification thatrequired the government to establish the existence of a compellinginterest. 89 After the court remanded the case for trial, the state chose tomake the promotion of the well-being of children the centerpiece of itsdefense of marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution.During his opening statement at the bench trial, the state's lawyer told thecourt \"that the optimal development of children is most likely to occurif... children are raised by their mother and father.\" 90 In contrast to whatthe state believed to be this well-established principle, the plaintiffs wereproposing the \"new and novel [theory]... that children do not need amother and a father to raise them, that any two people can do it.\"91 Thestate rejected this notion because \"[c]hildren raised by their mother andfather have [a] unique gender-related learning experience.\" 92 The state'slawyer assured the court that the evidence would show that paternal andmaternal \"nurturing style[s]\" had distinct effects on children.93After a nine-day trial, however, the government failed to persuade thecourt that dual-gender parenting was an essential component of goodparenting. 94 It did not help the state's case that its leading expert witness-who testified, as expected, that children benefit from having a mother andchildren are socialized and supported by responsible, committed adults ....

As thegovernment argued in its brief defending the constitutionality of the banagainst same-sex marriage before the Washington Supreme Court, \"Thecomplementary and unique characteristics and qualities men and womenbring together in marriage are not replicated in any other relationship ....95.

It is more than a little ironic that the state relied on broad generalizationsregarding the differing abilities of male and female parents, as well as the differing effects ofthose capacities on children, in a case in which the Hawaii supreme court concluded that theban against same-sex marriage constituted a suspect sex-based classification. See Baehr v.Lewin, 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993).

Rubenstein et al., supra note 80, at 612.98. See infra notes 99, 106 and accompanying texts.99. In the state of Washington's same-sex marriage litigation, for example, thegovernment argued \"that rearing children in a home headed by their opposite-sex parents is alegitimate state interest furthered by limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples becausechildren tend to thrive in families consisting of a father, mother, and their biologicalchildren.\" Andersen v. King County, 138 P.3d 963, 983 (Wash. 2006). The WashingtonSupreme Court accepted this argument, noting that \"the legislature was entitled to believethat providing that only opposite-sex couples may marry will encourage procreation andchild-rearing in a 'traditional' nuclear family where children tend to thrive.\" Id.; see also id.at 990 (\"The legislature was entitled to believe that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couplesfurthers the State's legitimate interests in procreation and the well-being of children.\"). TheNew York Court of Appeals has reached a similar conclusion. See infra note 106 andaccompanying text.[Vol. 762754THE BL URRING OF THE LINESSociety derives much benefit from the relationship defined as marriage.These benefits stem from the unique dynamics of a male-femalerelationship.\"' 0 0 The necessary implication of this argument is that menparent in ways that are fundamentally different from the way that womenparent, and that, therefore, two men who parent together, for example, nomatter how well intentioned or how much they love their children, areunable to provide the \"extra value\" afforded to children by female parents(and vice versa).' 0 'The crucial point, then, is this: the argument against same-sex marriagebased on the unique value of dual-gender parenting and the argumentagainst interracial marriages deployed by supporters of antimiscegenationstatutes explored in Part I both rely on the idea of natural, essential,predetermined differences between two categories of individuals to justifylimitations on who has access to the institution of marriage. The dual-gender parenting argument deployed against the recognition of same-sex100. Brief of Appellant King County at 37, Andersen v. King County, 138 P.3d 963(Wash. 2006) (No. 75934-1) (omission in original) (quoting testimony provided to the statelegislature by Jeff Kemp of the Washington Family Council). This argument is closelylinked to the notion that male-female relationships are unique because of their procreativecapabilities. As the government argued in the Washington same-sex marriage case, \"Mostopposite-sex couples have the ability to create, without the involvement of a third party, achild who is biologically related to both of them. No other relationship has this potential.The unique and profound biological relationship between mothers and fathers and theirchildren provides a rational basis to treat relationships that can create children differentlythan other relationships.\" Reply Brief of Appellant King County at 17, Andersen, 138 P.3d963 (No. 75934-1).The fact that the procreation argument against recognizing same-sex relationships isusually deployed alongside the dual-gender parenting argument is an example of theconflation between \"sex\" and \"gender\" that frequently accompanies discussions of same-sexmarriage and parenting. For a further discussion of this conflation, see supra note 6. Theprocreative argument, which is based on what one court characterized as \"a function ofbiology\" that results from the \"innate, complementary, procreative roles [of men andwomen],\" Hernandez v. Robles, 805 N.Y.S.2d 354, 360 (App. Div. 2005), aff'd, 855 N.E.2d1 (N.Y. 2006), would seem to go to issues of \"sex,\" that is, to the seemingly naturaldifferences between men and women. That argument, however, is almost always followedby the seemingly gender-based notion that mothers and fathers care for children infundamentally different ways. See Goodridge v. Dep't of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 962(Mass. 2003) (noting that the government's \"first stated rationale, equating marriage withunassisted heterosexual procreation, shades imperceptibly into its second: that confiningmarriage to opposite-sex couples ensures that children are raised in the 'optimal' setting\").101. The state of Vermont argued in its brief to the state supreme court defending its banagainst same-sex marriage that only children raised by different-sex couples can \"see andexperience the innate and unique abilities and characteristics that each sex possesses andcontributes to their combined endeavor.\" Ball, supra note 6, at 711 (quoting State ofVermont's Brief at 54, Baker v.

It seems to me that proponents of bansagainst same-sex marriage are, in effect, defending a concept of \"sex/genderpurity.\" From this perspective, the differences between men and womenwhen they serve as parents-as the Washington Supreme Court succinctlyput it in rejecting the constitutional challenge to that state's same-sexmarriage ban-are \"nonfungible.\" 10 3 Under this reasoning, the abilities ofparents, and their impact on children, are strongly correlated to theirsex/gender. This conclusion, in turn, renders suspect the arguments raisedby proponents of the legal recognition of same-sex relationships that thechildren of same-sex couples are as likely to benefit from the nurture andcare provided by their parents as are the children of different-sexcouples. 104102. The arguments in favor of antimiscegenation laws and those in favor of bans againstsame-sex marriage do differ in one respect: while the former call for racial segregation inmarriage, the latter call for sex/gender integration in marriage. Antimiscegenation laws, inother words, aim to keep the races separate when it comes to marriage, while the bansagainst same-sex marriage (ostensibly) seek to maintain and protect those intimaterelationships that bring together individuals of different sexes/genders. The important point,however, is that both marital restrictions are grounded in the idea that individuals havecertain natural, essential, and predetermined characteristics and attributes that (should)render them ineligible to marry someone of a different race (in the case of antimiscegenationlaws) or of the same sex/gender (in the case of same-sex marriage bans).103. Andersen, 138 P.3d at 1005.104. Supporters of the notion that dual-gender parenting is an essential element of optimalparenting frequently point to studies which show that children who do not have fathersparticipating in their lives do not do as well as those who do. See id. at 1006 (noting that\"[s]tudies summarized in the record before one trial court demonstrated that an absent fatheris associated with quantifiable deficits in children at every stage of the lifecycle, persistingnot only in the adulthood of the child, but even into the next generation\" (internal quotationmarks omitted)). Those studies, however, usually compare households headed byheterosexual single mothers with families headed by different-sex spouses. See id. at 1006n.47 (citing to three studies that compared children raised by single mothers with childrenraised by married heterosexual parents). The studies do not compare households headed bytwo different-sex spouses with households headed by two lesbian mothers to determinewhether the lack of a male parent in the latter negatively affects children. This point hasbeen acknowledged by the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, an organization thatopposes same-sex marriage. See Maggie Gallagher & Joshua K. Baker, Inst. for Marriageand Pub.

It would seem to follow from the court's reasoning, in otherwords, that boys in particular benefit from seeing what a \"man\" is really\"like\" and that girls in particular benefit from observing what a \"woman\" isreally \"like.\" The New York court took as a given not only that men andwomen are different in fundamental ways, but also-by using the singular(i.e., \"a man\" and \"a woman\") in setting up the frame of reference-thatthere is little differentiation within the two sex/gender categories.The benefits of having a parent of the same sex was made even moreexplicit by a judge who dissented from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicialconclude that children benefit from being raised by a married mother and father have notcompared the well-being of such children with those raised by same-sex couples).105.

Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1, 7 (N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). These typesof arguments associated with the quality and distinctiveness of sex/gender-based parentingwere once used to justify the so-called \"tender years\" doctrine, which presumed, in custodycases, that mothers were better able to care for young children than fathers. That doctrinehas been repudiated by most jurisdictions. See Alexandra Selfridge, Equal Protection andGender Preference in Divorce Contests over Custody, 16 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 165, 174(2007) (discussing the law on this point in several jurisdictions). One of the courts thatrejected the maternal preference presumption is the Maryland Court of Appeals. See Elza v.Elza, 475 A.2d 1180, 1183-84 (Md. 1984). Several years after Elza, a trial court granted amother's petition requesting that custody of her daughters be taken away from the father andgiven to her because the younger of the two girls in particular had \"a need for a femalehand.\" Giffin v. Crane, 716 A.2d 1029, 1033 (Md. 1998) (emphasis omitted). The MarylandCourt of Appeals rejected that view, holding that \"[t]he trial court erred [when] it assumedthat the [mother] necessarily would be a better custodian solely because she has a femalehand, and that a girl child of a certain age has a particular and specific need to be with hersame sex parent.\" Id. at 1040.2008] 2757FORDHAM LAW REVIEWCourt's decision striking down the state's ban against same-sex marriage. 107This particular judge was troubled by the fact that lesbian couples might notbe able to effectively teach their sons about what it means to be a mansexually:[The raising of children by a same-sex couple] raises the prospect ofchildren lacking any parent of their own gender. For example, a boyraised by two lesbians as his parents has no male parent.... It is...rational to posit that the child himself might invoke gender as ajustification for the view that neither of his parents \"understands\" him, orthat they \"don't know what he is going through,\" particularly if hisdisagreement or dissatisfaction involves some issue pertaining to sex.' 0 8 *In other words, mothers, because they are women, are apparently unable toadequately teach their sons about matters related to sexuality andintimacy. 10 9 This is a highly essentialized and rigid understanding of107.

The same judge determined that it is rational forthe legislature to conclude thata family environment with married opposite-sex parents remains the optimal socialstructure in which to bear children, and that the raising of children by same-sexcouples, who by definition cannot be the two sole biological parents of a child andcannot provide children with a parental authority figure of each gender, presents analternative structure for child rearing that has not yet proved itself beyondreasonable scientific dispute to be as optimal as the biologically based marriagenorm.Id. at 999-1000 (footnote omitted). The judge added that the fact that Massachusetts lawallows same-sex couples to adopt does not undermine the rationality of the same-sexmarriage ban because \"adoption presupposes that at least one of the child's biologicalparents is unable or unwilling ... to participate in raising the child. In that sense, society has'lost' the optimal setting in which to raise that child-it is simply not available.\" Id. at 1000.109. The state of Florida, in defending the constitutionality of a law that prohibits lesbiansand gay men from adopting, not only argued that dual-gender parenting plays a \"vitalrole.., in shaping sexual and gender identity,\" but that it is also crucial \"in providingheterosexual role modeling.\" Lofton v. Sec'y of the Dep't of Children & Family Servs., 358F.3d 804, 818 (1 1th Cir. 2004). This latter argument posits that heterosexual parents arebetter able to provide their children with the education and guidance needed to date membersof the opposite sex. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found this argumentto be rational, concluding that heterosexuals \"are better positioned than homosexualindividuals to provide adopted children with education and guidance relative to their sexualdevelopment throughout pubescence and adolescence\" given that the majority of adoptedchildren will eventually manifest a different-sex sexual orientation.

The court did not explain what might be in the best interests of those children whowill eventually manifest a same-sex sexual orientation.Judge Rosemary Barkett, in a dissent from the denial of en banc review in Lofton,ridiculed the panel's reasoning on this point:There is certainly no evidence that the ability to share one's adolescent datingexperiences (or lack thereof) is an important, much less essential, facet ofparenting. The difficult transition to adulthood is a common human experience,not an experience unique to human beings of a particular race, gender, or sexualorientation. It is downright silly to argue that parents must have experiencedeverything that a child will experience in order to guide them.Lofton v. Sec'y of the Dep't of Children & Family Servs., 377 F.3d 1275, 1299 (1 1th Cir.2004) (Barkett, J., dissenting from denial of en banc review).2758 [Vol. 76THE BLURRING OF THE LINESsex/gender: male parents can do things that female parents cannot and viceversa.In addition to concerns about the need to have a parental role model ofthe same sex and about teaching children the facts of life, opponents ofsame-sex marriage worry that children raised by same-sex couples will beconfused in terms of what is expected of them given their sex/gender.110Interestingly, there may be some support for this view. There is somesuggestion in the empirical literature that the children of gay and lesbianparents tend to have preferences, and to act in ways, that are less consistentwith traditional sex/gender expectations than children raised byheterosexual parents. 111  Some studies, for example, suggest that thedaughters of lesbian mothers express a greater interest in pursuingoccupations (such as law, medicine, and engineering) that have traditionallybeen dominated by men than do the daughters of heterosexual mothers. 12Some of the studies also suggest that the level of aggressiveness and theplay preferences of the sons of lesbian mothers are less gender typical.\" 13In my estimation, this departure from traditional sex/gender expectationsamong the children of lesbians and gay men, to the extent it exists, is apositive development because it undermines an understanding of sex/genderthat is essentialized and binary in nature. The preliminary empiricalfindings, in other words, support the position that sex/gender categories areas malleable and contestable as racial ones. From this perspective, thedefinition of what it means to be a man or a woman (or to act in male orfemale ways) is a fluid one, constructed through social norms, practices,and expectations.In contrast, conservative opponents of same-sex marriage tend to viewsex/gender categories in the same way that proponents of antimiscegenationstatutes viewed racial groups, that is, as natural and static categories thatexist largely outside of forces of social construction. For them, there areparticular and predetermined ways in which-to paraphrase the New YorkCourt of Appeals-men are like and women are like,\"14 and society has alegitimate interest in making sure that every new generation of parentsraises children in ways that are consistent with those sex/gender110.

Parenting by lesbians and gay men-especially when done by couples-is threatening because it blurs theseemingly natural and clear lines of demarcation between sex/gendercategories in the same way that interracial couples who are parents blurseemingly natural and clear racial lines.There is, finally, an additional similarity between the two marriage bansand their relationship to children, namely, their relative ineffectiveness. AsI noted in Part I, the antimiscegenation regime was eventually undermined,as a practical matter, by the fact that each successive generation of racialintermixing led to ever-increasing degrees of racial gradations andpermutations.11 5 It may have been possible to prohibit white people frommarrying black people, but it was much more difficult to prevent them fromhaving children. The birth of each new interracial child, in turn, only led toeven greater racial intermixing when that child eventually had children ofhis or her own.Similarly, it is possible to prevent individuals from marrying others oftheir own sex/gender. It is much more difficult, however, to prevent themfrom raising children together. Indeed, the state has been considerablymore successful in withholding marital status from lesbians and gay menthan it has been in withholding parental status from them. That this is thecase is hardly surprising. Many of the children raised by lesbians and gaymen are biologically related to them, and the state, as a constitutionalmatter, cannot unduly interfere with those relationships once they exist.1 16In particular, there is little that the state can do to prevent lesbian and gayparents from choosing to have their partners help raise their children.Although the issue of whether those partners will be recognized as legalparents is a complicated one that frequently varies by jurisdiction, 117 theimportant point is that the same-sex marriage bans have been quiteineffective in preventing same-sex couples from raising children together,and therefore have been quite ineffective in promoting what the states insistis the optimal form of parenting.And herein lies the ultimate irrationality of the children-based argumentsagainst same-sex marriages. In order to advance the purported interests ofsome children (i.e., those raised by different-sex couples), policy makers-with the constitutional approval of many courts-seem more than happy todeny other children (i.e., those raised by same-sex couples) the protectionsand stability that would be afforded to them through the legal recognition ofthe relationships between the care-giving adults. It is children-rather thanunderstandings of what \"men are like\" and \"women are like\"-who are115. See supra notes 48-57 and accompanying text.116. The Supreme Court first discussed the constitutional limitations on the ability of thestate to interfere with the parent-child relationship in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S.510, 518-19 (1925). and Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923). The sameconstitutional protections available to lesbian and gay parents who are biologically related totheir children apply, of course, to lesbians and gay men who become legal parents throughadoption.117. See Rubenstein et al., supra note 80, at 148-54.[Vol. 762760THE BLURRING OF THE LINEStruly nonfungible. 118 While the prohibition against same-sex marriageharms the children of same-sex couples (by denying them the benefits thatwould accompany the legal recognition of the relationships between theadults),119 it does nothing for those children who will be raised by different-sex couples regardless of whether lesbians and gay men are permitted tomarry. 1201II. LOVING, CHILDREN, AND SEX/GENDER-BASED PREJUDICEThe plaintiffs in same-sex marriage cases have sought to use the holdingand reasoning of Loving v. Virginia in two ways. First, they have arguedthat Loving, as well as other Supreme Court marriage cases, 12 1 supports thenotion that there is a fundamental right to marry that requires courts toapply heightened scrutiny when assessing the constitutionality of the bansagainst same-sex marriage. 122 This first argument goes to the question of118. See supra note 103 and accompanying text (noting that the Washington SupremeCourt concluded that men and women are \"nonfungible\" when they act as parents).119. As the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has noted, \"Excluding same-sexcouples from civil marriage will not make children of opposite-sex marriages more secure,but it does prevent children of same-sex couples from enjoying the immeasurable advantagesthat flow from the assurance of a stable family structure in which children will be reared,educated, and socialized.\" Goodridge v. Dep't of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 964 (Mass.2003).120. Efforts to connect the well-being of the children of different-sex relationships to theban on same-sex marriages can border on the absurd. The New York Court of Appealsdefended the rationality of the ban by using the following curious reasoning: (1) different-sex relationships that produce children can be \"casual or temporary\" because of the ease withwhich those children can be created through heterosexual sex; (2) in contrast, same-sexcouples who want to have children have to engage in considerable discussions and planning,and as a result, enjoy relationships that are more stable than those of different sex-couples;therefore (3) it is rational for the legislature to limit the stability and permanence provided bymarriage to those couples (and their children) who need it most! See Hernandez v. Robles,855 N.E.2d 1, 7 (N.Y. 2006); see also Morrison v. Sadler, 821 N.E.2d 15, 30 (Ind. App.2005) (noting that \"[e]ven accepting that many same-sex couples are successfully raisingchildren in today's society, these couples are not at 'risk' of having random and unexpectedchildren by virtue of their ordinary sexual activities\").The complete disconnect between permitting same-sex couples to marry and thepromotion of responsible childrearing by different-sex couples makes the New York court'sreasoning deeply flawed. For the court's argument to carry weight, we would have to bepersuaded that some different-sex relationships will turn out to be less \"casual or temporary\"because of the fact that same-sex couples are not allowed to marry. Such a contention makesno sense. Chief Justice Judith S. Kaye in her dissent noted that \"no one rationally decides tohave children because gays and lesbians are' excluded from marriage.\" Hernandez, 855N.E.2d at 31 (Kaye, C.J., dissenting). Similarly, no one rationally decides to stay with one'sdifferent-sex partner after having children with that person because lesbians and gay men areexcluded from marriage.121. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987) (holding that prisoners enjoy aconstitutional right to marry); Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978) (holding thatindividuals who owe child support cannot be denied the opportunity to marry).122. See, e.g., Conaway v. Deane, 932 A.2d 571, 619 (Md. 2007) (noting that gaylitigants, in arguing that individuals have a fundamental right to marry the person of theirchoice, rely inter alia on Loving); Lewis v. Harris, 908 A.2d 196, 210 (N.J. 2006)(\"Plaintiffs ... rely on [Loving] to support their claim that the right to same-sex marriage isfundamental.\" (citation omitted)).2008] 2761FORDHAM LAW REVIEWwhether the prohibition against same-sex marriage violates substantive dueprocess rights. Most courts that have addressed that question haveanswered it in the negative, concluding that Loving and the other SupremeCourt marriage cases stand for the proposition that the fundamental right tomarry is limited to the traditional definition of the institution of marriage,one that requires spouses to be of different sexes/genders. 123For purposes of this essay, I am interested in the second way in whichplaintiffs in same-sex marriage cases have sought to use Loving, one thataddresses issues of equal protection. 124 Since the Hawaii Supreme Court'sdecision in Baehr v. Lewin, 125 most plaintiffs in same-sex marriage caseshave argued inter alia that the bans against gay marriage areunconstitutional because they discriminate on the basis of sex/gender. 126The states have responded to this contention by raising an \"equalapplication\" defense, namely, that the bans do not constitute impermissiblesex/gender discrimination because they treat men and women equally. Inother words, men and women are equally prevented from marrying othersof the same sex/gender, and therefore, it is argued, the different-sexrequirement embodied in the marriage statutes is not intended to benefit onesex/gender category over another.12 7Plaintiffs have sought to counter the \"equal application\" defense byreminding courts that the Commonwealth of Virginia also argued in Lovingthat its antimiscegenation statute did not violate the Constitution because itimposed an equal burden on whites and blacks-members of both groupswere equally prohibited from marrying someone from the other group. 128Gay plaintiffs have argued that courts today should reject the \"equalapplication\" defense raised by the states in the same-sex marriage cases inthe same way that the Loving Court rejected the notion that the equalapplication of Virginia's antimiscegenation statute immunized it from achallenge under the Equal Protection Clause. 129123. See, e.g., Conaway, 932 A.2d at 620; Lewis, 908 A.2d at 210; Hernandez, 855N.E.2d at 9-10; Andersen v. King County, 138 P.3d 963, 989 (Wash. 2006) (en banc).124. I have elsewhere addressed the relevance of the Supreme Court's marriage cases tothe due process question of whether the fundamental right to marry includes same-sexcouples within its ambit. See generally Carlos A. Ball, The Positive in the FundamentalRight to Marry: Same-Sex Marriage in the Aftermath of Lawrence v. Texas, 88 Minn. L.Rev. 1184 (2004).125. 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993) (holding that the ban against same-sex marriage constitutesa sex-based classification that requires the state to establish a compelling interest).126.

They havealso noted, however, that the Loving Court rejected the \"equal application\"defense because it concluded that the antimiscegenation law was motivatedby invidious racial discrimination and that it was part of a broader effort toestablish and maintain a regime of \"White Supremacy.\"' 31 In contrast,these courts have contended that the bans against same-sex marriage are notmotivated by sex/gender-based prejudice. As the New York Court ofAppeals said,By limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples, New York is notengaging in sex discrimination. The limitation does not put men andwomen in different classes, and give one class a benefit not given to theother. Women and men are treated alike-they are permitted to marrypeople of the opposite sex, but not people of their own sex. This is notthe kind of sham equality that the Supreme Court confronted in Loving;the statute there, prohibiting black and white people from marrying eachother, was in substance anti-black legislation. Plaintiffs do not argue herethat the legislation they challenge is designed to subordinate either men towomen or women to men as a class.1 32For its part, the Maryland Court of Appeals, in rejecting theconstitutional challenge to that state's ban on same-sex marriage, concludedthat[b]ecause there is no evidence in the record before us that the Legislatureintended . . . to differentiate between men and women as classes on thebasis of some misconception regarding gender roles in our society, weconclude that the [state constitution's Equal Rights Amendment] does notMarriage Act] violates the [Maryland Constitution's Equal Rights Amendment]. Plaintiffsreason that in Loving the Court held Virginia's antimiscegenation statute invalid even thoughthe law treated the races equally.\"). The Court in Loving reasoned as follows: \"[W]e rejectthe notion that the mere 'equal application' of a statute containing racial classifications isenough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of allinvidious racial discriminations.\" Loving, 388 U.S. at 8.130. See, e.g., Conaway, 932 A.2d at 601-02; Hernandez, 855 N.E.2d at 11; Andersen,138 P.3d at 989. But see Goodridge v. Dep't of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 971 (Mass.2003) (Greaney, J., concurring) (\"The equal protection infirmity at work here is strikinglysimilar to ... the invidious discrimination perpetrated by Virginia's antimiscegenation lawsunveiled in the decision of Loving v.

Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, 63 (Haw. 1993) (analogizing to Loving inconcluding that a same-sex marriage ban constitutes a sex-based classification).131. See Loving, 388 U.S. at 11.132.

As the Supreme Court, in addressing the issue of sex/genderdiscrimination has made clear, prejudice in this area is not limited to theexplicit or overt preference of one sex/gender category over another.Instead, sex/gender-based prejudice is often grounded in the acceptance andreplication of stereotypes about the purportedly distinct abilities, needs, andinterests of men and women.134133. Conaway, 932 A.2d at 602; see also Goodridge, 798 N.E.2d at 992 n.13 (Cordy, J.,dissenting) (\"Unlike Virginia's antimiscegenation statute, neither the purpose nor the effectof the Massachusetts marriage statute is to advantage or disadvantage one gender over theother. This distinction is critical and was central to the Loving decision.\"); Baker, 744 A.2dat 880 n.13 (rejecting the argument that a same-sex marriage ban constitutes animpermissible sex-based classification given the absence of evidence showing purposefuldiscrimination).134. I will concede for purposes of argument that marriage laws impact men and womenequally in order to focus on the further conclusion reached by several courts that thesex/gender-based marital restriction is not based on prejudice. As many commentators havenoted, however, the history of the institution of marriage is replete with examples of theways in which it has contributed, in powerful ways, to the subordination of women by men.See Claudia Card, Against Marriage and Motherhood, 11 Hypatia 1, 4 (1996) (\"Marriageand motherhood in the history of modem patriarchies have been mandatory for andoppressive to women .... ); Nancy D. Polikoff, Why Lesbians and Gay Men Should ReadMartha Fineman, 8 Am. Univ. J. Gender Soc. Pol'y & L. 167, 170 (2000) (noting how forsecond-wave feminists \"[m]arriage was the principal institution that maintained...patriarchy\"); see also Susan Frelich Appleton, Missing in Action? Searching for GenderTalk in the Same-Sex Marriage Debate, 16 Stan. L. & Pol'y Rev. 97, 107 (2005) (\"[A]nytemptation to assert that same-sex marriage bans do not discriminate because they applyequally to men and women alike must give way in view of males' traditional position ofsuperiority in law, society, and family life.\" (footnote omitted)); Justin Reinheimer, Note,Same-Sex Marriage Through the Equal Protection Clause: A Gender-Conscious Analysis,21 Berkeley J. Gender L. & Just. 213, 231 (2006) (\"Women of all sexualities, as a group, aredisproportionately impacted by marriage given the institution's role in maintaining andenforcing sex inequality .... \"). One of the most important components of thatsubordination results from the indisputable proposition that the norm of dual-genderparenting, defended by states in the same-sex marriage litigation, has traditionally expectedmuch more child care of mothers than it has of fathers. This unequal application of the normof dual-gender parenting, in turn, has significantly restricted the social, political, andeconomic opportunities of women.Although I am persuaded by the critique of the traditional understanding of marriage asone that subordinates women to the interests of men, I wonder whether a majority of judges,in the foreseeable future, are likely to agree. My sense is that judges may be more open tothe idea that the marital sex/gender restriction is ultimately grounded in stereotypes about theabilities and traits of both men and women than to the notion that the institution of marriage,as traditionally understood, is an intrinsically patriarchal one. The subordination argumentand the stereotyping argument, of course, are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the institutionof marriage has historically served to subordinate women precisely because of stereotypical[Vol. 762764THE BLURRING OF THE LINESThe Supreme Court in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, for example,concluded that defendants engage in impermissible discrimination underTitle VII when they make employment-related decisions that are groundedin sex/gender-based stereotypical understandings of the way in whichindividuals should act. 135 As the Court stated,[W]e are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees byassuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated withtheir group, for [i]n forbidding employers to discriminate againstindividuals because of their sex, Congress intended to strike at the entirespectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sexstereotypes. 136The Court has been similarly suspicious of sex/gender stereotypes wheninterpreting the Equal Protection Clause. In United States v. Virginia, forexample, the state argued that women students were incapable of benefitingfrom the application by the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) of what itcalled its \"adversative method\" of instruction. 137  That method wascharacterized by \"[p]hysical rigor, mental stress, absolute equality oftreatment, absence of privacy, minute regulation of behavior, andindoctrination in desirable values.\" 138 The state justified the categoricalexclusion of women from VMI by arguing that there are important\"psychological and sociological differences\" between men and women thatmade the application of the adversative method to women less beneficialand effective.139 The Court rejected the state's position, noting that \"[s]tateactors controlling gates to opportunity . . . may not exclude qualifiedindividuals based on fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities ofmales and females.\"' 140 The Court added that the government, in meetingits high burden in defending policy-based sex/gender distinctions, cannot\"rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, orpreferences of males and females.\"' 141It should be added that the Court has not exempted from constitutionalscrutiny sex/gender-based considerations related to what the state believesis the optimal allocation of responsibilities within family units. In Orr v.Orr, for example, the Court was confronted with a law that imposedunderstandings of the needs, interests, and capabilities of women/wives. Given the facialneutrality of sex/gender marital restrictions, however, it may be easier to persuade judges ofthe constitutional infirmity of those restrictions by exposing how arguments in support ofsame-sex marriage bans rely on stereotypes relating to both men and women rather thanthrough a patriarchy-based critique that ultimately requires judges to conclude that theinstitution of marriage, as currently defined, promotes the subordination of women.135.

Becauseemployers continued to regard the family as the woman's domain, they oftendenied men similar accommodations or discouraged them from taking leave.These mutually reinforcing stereotypes created a self-fulfilling cycle ofdiscrimination that forced women to continue to assume the role of primary familycaregiver, and fostered employers' stereotypical views about women'scommitment to work and their value as employees.Nev.

These courts have failed to understand, however, that theequal application of a governmental policy that is grounded on sex/genderstereotypes is as constitutionally impermissible as the unequal applicationof such a policy.An example might help to explain this point. It would seem clear that thegovernment, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, could notimplement a policy that denied all promotions to its female employees who,in the government's estimation, are too masculine. It would also seem clearthat the government could not implement a separate policy that denied allpromotions to its male employees whom it regards as being too feminine.But what if the government were to institute a single policy that deniedemployees all promotions on the ground that they fail to abide by what thegovernment believes is appropriate sex/gender-based behavior? It ispossible to articulate this policy in a facially neutral way by, for example,announcing that promotions will not be given to any employees who act inways that are inconsistent with their sex/gender. The government, in turn,could try to argue that its unified policy is constitutional because it treatsmen and women in the same way. Courts, however, would likely andproperly reject that contention because the government would be denyingopportunities to individuals based on sex/gender stereotypes, that is, on thenotion that there are proper ways for men to conduct themselves and thatthere are distinct ways in which women should conduct themselves. 146The same reasoning should be applied when assessing the legitimacy ofthe effort by states to justify the exclusion of same-sex couples from theinstitution of marriage on the ground that a parent from each sex/gendercategory is required in order for children to receive optimal parental care.145.

West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 308 (1880) (footnoteomitted)).2008] 2767FORDHA M LA W RE VIE WAlthough this justification can be packaged in a seemingly sex/gender-neutral way (i.e., as a single policy that impacts men and women in thesame manner), it is nonetheless constitutionally unacceptable because it isgrounded in stereotypical understandings of how sex/gender determines(and constrains) the ability of parents to nurture and care for theirchildren. ' 47It is true, as an empirical matter, that married mothers generally spendmore time performing child care (and doing domestic work) than do theirhusbands.148 The social science literature also suggests that married fathersspend more time playing with their children, while mothers spend moretime meeting the practical needs of their children.149 The normative notion,however, that optimal child care depends on something unique aboutmothers as women conflates social expectations and roles imposed onparents according to their sex/gender with seemingly natural and intrinsiccharacteristics that distinguish women from men (and vice versa).'10The Supreme Court has made it clear that, \"[w]hen state actors ... [rely]on gender stereotypes, they ratify and reinforce prejudicial views of therelative abilities of men and women.\"151 Courts in same-sex marriage casesneed to be more skeptical than they have been so far in assessing thevalidity of the contention that optimal parenting depends on considerations147. Professor Stephen Clark has noted that the equal application defense raised by thestates in same-sex marriage cases has a \"superficial appeal\" because, at a broad level ofgenerality, the marriage bans seem to represent a single policy that treats men and womenequally. Stephen Clark, Same-Sex But Equal: Reformulating the Miscegenation Analogy, 34Rutgers L.J. 107, 143 (2002). The defense, however, constitutes nothing more than a\"semantic shell game,\" id. at 144, meant to hide the fact that the bans are \"designed tosimultaneously enforce both a male gender role and a female gender role, [thus] amount[ing]to a regime of dual discrimination injuring both sexes,\" id. at 140.148. \"Although fathers' engagement with children has increased in recent decades,mothers continue to do about two thirds of all child care.\" Daniel N. Hawkins et al., Parent-Adolescent Involvement: The Relative Influence of Parent Gender and Residence, 68 J.Marriage & Fam. 125, 125 (2006) (citation omitted).149. Leslie D. Hall et al., Gender and Family Work in One-Parent Households, 57 J.Marriage & Fam. 685, 686 (1995).150. It is interesting to note that the reports on the differences in parenting roles betweenmen and women have for the most part studied intact families in which there is a mother andfather present in the home. A recent study that compared single fathers with single mothers,however, found that they did not differ in either the time spent with their children or in thekinds of activities that they engage in with their children. Id. at 690 & tbl.4. This suggeststhat the differences reported in the literature on both of these criteria are not explained bynatural differences between men or women, but are instead explained by the differentexpectations (both social and internal) that attach to being a male parent and a female parentin married, different-sex households. As the authors of the study note,Being the caretaker of family members is seen by women, and more broadly bysociety, as something women are rather than as something they do. Conversely,caretaking is something that fathers ... do rather than something that they are.The meaning of the activity differs by virtue of the gender of the actor.Consequently, the family labor of women and men both shapes and is shaped bysocial constructions of gender.Id. at 691.151. J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 140.[Vol. 762768THE BLURRING OF THE LINESof sex/gender. It is not permissible, under Supreme Court precedents, torely, as the New York Court of Appeals did, on \"[i]ntuition and experience\"in assessing the constitutional validity of that argument. 152Indeed, although one would not know it by reading recent judicialopinions upholding the constitutionality of bans against same-sex marriage,many social scientists question the connection between optimal parentingand sex/gender. As stated in the introduction to the most recent edition ofone of the leading texts on the role that fathers play in the well-being ofchildren,[F]athers and mothers seem to influence their children in similar ratherthan dissimilar ways. Contrary to the expectations of manydevelopmental psychologists, the differences between mothers and fathersappear to be much less important than the similarities .... [T]hemechanisms and means by which fathers influence their children alsoappear very similar to those that mediate maternal influences on children.Stated differently, students of socialization have consistently found thatparental warmth, nurturance, and closeness are associated with positivechild outcomes regardless of whether the parent involved is a mother or afather. The important dimensions of parental influence are those thathave to do with parental characteristics rather than gender-relatedcharacteristics. 153Furthermore, despite the rejection by most courts of the applicability ofLoving to the issue of same-sex marriage, that case would seem to be highlyrelevant to an equality-based constitutional challenge to same-sex marriagebans given that the optimal parenting justification for those bans isgrounded, as I explored in Part II, in the idea of natural, essential, andpredetermined differences between men and women that is similar to thenotion of natural, essential, and predetermined differences between whites152. Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1, 7 (N.Y. 2006). Given that the dual-genderparenting argument, at its core, is based on the notion that men and women have differentabilities as parents that correlate directly to their sex/gender, the burden should be on thegovernment to present evidence that the absence of a male parent in a household headed by alesbian couple and the lack of a female parent in a household headed by a gay male couplenegatively affects children. Relying on studies that compare households headed by singleheterosexual mothers to those headed by different-sex spouses, see supra note 104, shouldnot be enough in cases in which the government chooses to defend a law on theconstitutionally suspect ground that men and women have \"different talents, capacities, orpreferences,\" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996).153. Michael E. Lamb & Catherine S. Tamis-Lemonda, The Role of the Father: AnIntroduction, in The Role of the Father in Child Development 1, 10 (Michael E. Lamb ed.,4th ed. 2004). Even Dr. Kyle Pruett, who was the leading witness for Hawaii during the trialthat assessed the constitutionality of that state's ban on same-sex marriage, see supra notes95-96 and accompanying text, and whose work is frequently cited by those who view dual-gender parenting as essential to the well-being of children, see, e.g., Wardle, supra note 86,at 857 n.120, 858 nn.125 & 130, 860 n.151, 861 n.158, has more recently written that \"I ...now realize that most of the enduring parental skills are probably, in the end, not dependenton gender,\" see Kyle D. Pruett, Fathemeed: Why Father Care Is as Essential as Mother Carefor Your Child 18 (2000).2008) 2769FORDHAM LAW REVIEWand blacks that served as the normative foundation for theantimiscegenation regime. 154The Supreme Court in Loving was willing to look behind the appearanceof equal treatment reflected on the face of Virginia's antimiscegenationstatute to assess the constitutionality of that law. Most courts that haveaddressed the constitutionality of the bans against same-sex marriage,however, have refused, in any meaningful way, to look behind the facade ofequal treatment contained in sex/gender-based marital restrictions. If thecourts were to do so, they would find, as I have sought to explain in thisessay, that both the interracial and the same-sex marriage bans, as reflectedin their respective relationships to children, have been grounded in the ideathat racial categories (in the context of antimiscegenation laws) andsex/gender categories (in the context of bans against same-sex marriage) arenatural categories that exist independently of human norms and practices.The marriage bans have been used as an important means to enforceboundaries between the categories in question that seem natural (and, tosome, God-given), but which are actually the result of forces of socialconstruction.The use of marital restrictions to police race-based boundaries is nowlargely discredited. The time has come for the use of marital restrictions topolice sex/gender-based boundaries to be deemed similarly suspect.154. See supra notes 99-114 and accompanying text.2770 [Vol. 76",
