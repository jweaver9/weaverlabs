An analysis of homeless queer youth during the HIV/AIDS and SARS-CoV-2 criseslays bare the systemic failure of the United States government to provide equitable healthcare._______________________As a child, I took any available opportunity to learn about queer histories in the UnitedStates. I intently absorbed all information I could get my hands on in effort to better understandmy own queer identity and to exist in the familiarity of queer stories. I came of age withYouTube; we grew simultaneously. Me: 12 years old religiously watching videos of queercreators as I shaped my own identity, and YouTube: metamorphizing into a platform that hadsocial weight. I was enraptured by this new community and from it I had my first introduction toHIV/AIDS. Without formal sex education my initial perception of AIDS was of a farawaydisease that maybe-at-one-time-long-ago was a death sentence. So, I watched video after videoof queer people coming out, describing HIV, telling stories of activism, and montaging images ofprotests to Macklemore’s Same Love.1 I, a suburban child of the millennium, from Annapolis,Maryland, felt a peculiar kinship with the people on my screen. Over the next ten years I foundways to center my education around queer stories. In the creation of my self-designed major atPitzer College, Queer Health Justice, I used public health framing to understand the intersectionsof queerness and health care, health accessibility and health justice in the United States. Theemergence of the coronavirus in 2019 centered my course work around histories of pandemics,1 Though no pre-teen years are without awkward memories, this is embarrassing.Young 28infectious diseases, and their metaphors. Paul Farmer and Susan Sontag’s sociocultural analysesof disease stigma and responsibility politics shifted my understanding of how healthcareaccessibility is shaped in the United States. The foundation of my analysis lies in their seminalworks that introduce the concept of disease moralization and responsibility.“Queer Survival Amidst HIV/AIDS, COVID-19, and Homelessness” demonstrates andcatalogs health accessibility needs for queer homeless youth that have persisted for forty yearsand through two major pandemics. This thesis examines existing literature to provide a newcomparative analysis on syndemics in queer homeless youth populations in the United States ofAmerica. There has been extensive research on the multidimensional challenges that queerhomeless youth face that impact mortality and morbidity outcomes, and discussion onstate-sanctioned violence and its specific harms to queer folks, particularly during major healthcrises, however none that has expressly compared HIV and COVID-19. I discovered anestablished need for comparative analysis as a tool for reimagining the future of public health.Importantly, I did not write “Queer Survival” to simply document the many atrocities and harmsperpetrated against queer youth thereby reducing their existence to vulnerability andsurvivorship. Nor is the point to paint a picture of innocence and infantilize the true-lifeexperiences of queer homeless youth. This thesis exists as an effort to gather and chronicledecades of research to amplify the contemporary needs of queer homeless youth in 2022.Where do I, an HIV negative individual who has always had access to secure, safe, andstable housing, fit into this conversation? As a student I have been given the opportunity andresources to engage with public health studies through a queer lens. I hope to use my research asa tool to empower and uplift the voices of queer homeless youth. I acknowledge that this thesis isincomplete; there are many more stories to be shared and facets of queerness that I have beenYoung 29unable to address. In the coming years language will evolve, and so I acknowledge that much ofthe vocabulary I am using may become inaccurate or inadequate.MethodologyIn this thesis, I draw on interdisciplinary literature from the fields of psychology,sociology, gender studies, biology, sexuality studies, public health, public policy, and history.Scholars in the United States have produced a plethora of research over the past forty years onqueer identity and pandemics; however, no contemporary comparison of intersecting pandemicsand epidemics in homeless queer youth populations is available. This gap in the existingliterature exposes the need for a comparative analysis of the syndemic of queer homelessness,HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19. I compiled a collection of primary and secondary sources includingtext analysis, census data, interviews, film, and historical analysis that spoke to the nuances ofqueer identity, using keywords and phrases such as: queer, LGBTQ, gay, homosexual,HIV/AIDS, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, transgender, pandemic, health accessibility, and healthcare. My primary research was conducted using scientific journals, medical studies, narrativeanthologies, and performance and visual art. As the coronavirus pandemic continuously unfoldedand presented new challenges, I surveyed contemporary news coverage from sources includingthe British Broadcasting Company (BBC), National Public Radio (NPR), Washington Post, NewYork Times, Wall Street Journal, Cable News Network (CNN), and Los Angeles Times. Thoughmany comorbidities are present in queer populations, the focus of this analysis is on COVID-19,HIV/AIDS, homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, mental health struggles, and tobacco use.Young 30TerminologyThe following terms will be used throughout my analysis.Queer is an umbrella term for those who are not heterosexual or cisgender; any deviation fromheteronormativity falls under ‘queer.’ For example, when asked of their sexuality, a woman whohas sex with women, may say, “I am queer.”2 It is important to recognize that the word queer wasonce weaponized as a slur against non-heterosexual or cisgender people. Folks with a broadrange of gender and sexual identities reclaimed the term queer as an inclusive term to representthose who deviate from the norm. The transition of queer from slur to identifier began in the late1980s; some say that the term became popularized by Queer Nation, an offshoot of ACT UP(AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), who followed the principle that those who perpetuate andperpetrate harm are disarmed when words are reclaimed.3 Though these terms, such as queer, stillcarry power, nuance, and may conjure vile notions, when they are used to self-describe thexenophobe has one less tool at their disposal.LGBTQIA2S+ refers to those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,intersex, asexual, and/or two-spirit. The + indicates that queer identities are expansive and thatthe definitions within “LGBTQIA2S” may not represent all peoples. The plus then leaves roomfor other gender and sexual identities.Homelessness is in reference to the state of lacking “a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttimeresidence.” If a person sleeps “in a shelter designated for temporary living accommodations or inplaces not designated for human habitation” they are homeless.44 Huffman, 2021.3  Perlman, 2019.2 For more information on queer terminology, the Human Rights Campaign has compiled a comprehensive glossary:https://www.hrc.org/resources/glossary-of-terms.Young 31Youth is in reference to individuals ten to twenty-four. Street youth is then in reference to youththat are homeless.The “at-risk” identity describes a person or peoples whose identity and lived-experiences haveincreased their engagement in behaviors that expose them to disease and illness, such as HIV andSARS-CoV-2 infection. This terminology has been widely used across public health spectra andhas entered into the common vernacular in the United States of America. It is typical for peopleto be described as “at-risk” for various conditions, however in this thesis it will pertain to the riskof HIV and COVID-19 infection.Deservedness is the societal condition in which engagement in risky behaviors allows the publicto place blame and responsibility on an individual, thereby moralizing the contraction of a deadlydisease. Deservedness is the state in which society deems an individual deserves a disease orillness and its consequences due to identity and engagement in risky behavior. The constructionof deservedness is dangerous as it socially absolves those with governing power from makingpublic health decisions, such as funding accessible, queer-friendly safe housing, and insteadplaces the blame of disease on the marginalized.Syndemic is a model of health that aggregates two or more concurrent or sequential epidemics ina population. This considers comorbidity, as well as the environmental and social factors thatimpact disease interaction.5 Syndemic theory provides a model for studying these relationships,while the term syndemic also refers to the relationship/interaction between diseases and socialconditions.5 Singer, 2009, 18.Young 32Introducing the Histories and Etiologies of HIV/AIDS and COVID-19HIV/AIDSThe HIV and AIDS pandemic began in June of 1981. Public Health officials first definedthe illness as “gay-related immune deficiency” (GRID). Doctors did not recognize AIDS inheterosexual couples until June 1983 and then suggested that AIDS could be transmitted throughheterosexual sex. In April of 1984, three years after the pandemic began, the National CancerInstitute announced that the viruses Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus (LAV) and HumanT-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III (HTLV-III) are identical and the cause of AIDS. Robert Galloand collaborators renamed LAV/HTLV-III to HIV in 1986 when the viruses were deemedidentical. The United States Food and Drug Administration then approved the first antiretroviralsix years after the crisis began.6 Public knowledge around HIV shifted when it became clear thatHIV can be contracted by anyone through blood transfusions, needle sharing, intravenous drugusage, anal sex, vaginal sex, and breast milk.7 Left untreated, HIV can develop into AIDS whichis diagnosed when the number of CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood.In comparison, a healthy individual has a typical CD4 count between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm3.These cells, which HIV destroys, have an important role in the immune system as they triggerthe body’s response to infection.HIV is transmitted through blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids,and breast milk. “HIV risk behaviors,” are acts that have a probability of transmitting HIV. Eachrisky behavior may have a low probability of HIV transmission, however, over time and withrepeated engagement with ''risky behaviors'' the likelihood of infection increases. The CDCdetermined the estimated probability of acquiring HIV from an infected source through varying7 However, the prejudices remained.6 Currie et al., 2020.Young 33exposure acts per every 10,000 exposures: the risk per 10,000 exposures for blood transfusionswas 9,250, for receptive anal intercourse it was 138, for needle-sharing during injection drug useit was 63, for percutaneous (needle-stick) it was 23, and for insertive anal intercourse it was 11.8People are at risk for contracting HIV when engaging in low rates of condom use, substanceabuse before sex, and having multiple sexual partners.COVID-19In December 2019, scientists discovered a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. The virusSARS-CoV-2, now notoriously known as “COVID-19,” rapidly spreads through droplets that areprojected from a person's mouth or nose. The virus has a spike protein that attaches to a humancell and infects the human host, causing symptoms such fever, cough, tiredness, shortness ofbreath, chills, and chest pain.9 In early 2020, fatal cases of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the worldand in March of 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic. Tomitigate spread, nations closed their borders, enforced mask mandates, and public dialogue on‘flattening the curve’ encouraged social distancing and mass closures of restaurants, businesses,churches, schools, sporting events, and other in-person activities.10 COVID-19 quickly became aleading cause of death in the United States and hospitals faced capacity and PPE shortages. Thehavoc and destruction wreaked by COVID-19 cannot be understated. Millions of people losttheir lives, homes, families, education, and support structures. As the pandemic continued in2021 and 2022, new variants emerged and continue to impact the global population.10 Katella, 20219 CDC, 20208 Patel et al., 2014Young 34A Brief Review of Existing LiteratureHousing instability for queer youth is impacted by the weakening of government-fundedsocial support structures, the rise of HIV, and the violence of homophobia. Queerness is not acausal driver for displacement, instead systemic homophobia, the policing of poverty and genderexpression, and other systems of oppression act as fundamental risk factors for homelessness.Queer youth who chose to leave home do so for a multitude of reasons including abusivehomelives, aging out of the foster care system, and desperate economic situations. In 1994, NicoQuintana, Josh Rosenthal, and Jeff Krehely published that 78% of the LGBT+ youth in the NewYork child welfare system ran away from or were removed from their foster homes due to“conflict and discrimination related to their sexual orientation or gender identity.”11 Later theyfound that more than half of their participants felt safer on the streets than in a group or fosterhome.12 This jarring statistic is worth repeating – youth felt safer on the streets than in group orfoster homes. When governmental care systems are failing youth so egregiously, it isunsurprising that so many youths, particularly queer youth, are/have been homeless. AdamRomero, Shoshana Golderb, and Luis Vasquez continued this research in 2020 when theyanalyzed contemporary LGBT housing affordability, discrimination, and homelessness. Theyfound that queer youth disproportionately face homelessness and housing instability due to:family rejection, sexual-orientation based discrimination by landlords, mortgage lenders,long-term care facilities, and other housing providers, as well as discrimination and bullying atschool and/or work, and the effects of being denied the financial benefits of marriage.13Furthermore, they found that “LGBT people are more likely than non-LGBT people to be poor,13 Romero, Goldberg, and Vasquez, 2020.12 Ibid, 14.11 Quintana, 2010, 14.Young 35to be renters, to have unstable housing, and to be homeless.”14 In 2019 Brodie Fraser et al.studied queer homelessness through an intersectional lens to understand what factors influencedwhy so many queer people in the United States experience homelessness. By grouping togetherproximate causes (poverty, ethnicity, racism), systematic failures (including sexual abuse, fostercare, discrimination, stigma, family), and experiences during homelessness (HIV, survival sex,sex work, shelter inaccessibility), they detailed a synergistic relationship. Fraser et al. described:LGBTIQ+ identity has a considerable role within this grouping [systemic failures]and its relationship to these themes acts as longer-term drivers of homelessness.As shown in the results, unsafe family situations can result in foster careplacement. Foster care has a bi-directional relationship with sexual abuse. Theliterature showed that sexual abuse (particularly within family structures) canresult in a young person being placed into foster care. Youth might thenexperience sexual abuse within the foster care system. Foster care has abi-directional relationship with discrimination and stigma; young people mightexperience high levels of discrimination and thus be placed into foster care; wherethey might experience further, or initial, discrimination and stigma due to theirLGBTIQ+ identity. Failures in care systems have the potential to induce substanceabuse and poor mental health. Additionally, they can produce economic and socialvulnerability which encourages people to engage in survival sex and sex work.Survival sex may also enable people to provide for themselves in order for themto be able to leave untenable family or foster care situations. Mental health isaffected by all of the themes in this grouping; experiencing any of these foursystematic failures can result in poor mental health. Thus, interventions targeted ataddressing these factors must also consider the ways in which they impact onpeople’s mental wellbeing, and ensure the intersectional nature of these issues isconsidered. It is primarily as a result of failures in these systems that LGBTIQ+people experience poor mental health. The overlapping nature of these systematicfailures shows a need for an inclusive, intersectional system to preventhomelessness.15Homelessness cannot be simplified into just unemployment, or just discrimination, or ascommonly told, just because of drug use. Instead, it is necessary to recognize the many factors ofhow and why folks become and stay homeless. This is aptly illustrated in Figure 1, which details15 Fraser et al., 2019.14 Ibid.Young 36the relationship between disease and experience interactions to homelessness.  The literatureconcurs that queer people are (and have been) disproportionately impacted by housing instabilityand homelessness. This renders queer youth more susceptible to homelessness, and thus morevulnerable to the negative health outcomes that accompany homelessness.16, 17, 18, 19, 20Figure 1. Intersections of queer identity and experiences of homelessness. From left toright; proximate causes of homelessness, systems failures in early life, and experiencesduring homelessness.21,22Health is multifaceted, and, as such, is impacted by many biological, social, and culturalfactors.  A syndemic is a model of health that aggregates two or more concurrent or sequentialepidemics in a population. This metric considers medical comorbidity, as well as theenvironmental and social factors that impact disease interaction.23 Queer homeless youth in the1980s to the 1990s faced the unique combination of HIV/AIDS, drug and alcohol addiction,mental illnesses, and tobacco use. Each syndemic factor interacted with one another, impacting23 Singer, Preface XV.22 Here, Fraser et al. utilize LGBTIQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer/questioning, plus) todescribe the people in their study. I have used the umbrella terminology “queer” for general cohesiveness.21 Ibid.20 Wilson and Kastanis, 2015.19 Mountz et al., 2018.18 Mallon and Mallon, 1998.17 Gattis, 2013.16 Shelton, 2016.Young 37the severity of the body's response. For example, researchers have found that street drug users,referring to the “marginalized, inner-city drug users who have been forced by poverty,discrimination, and addiction into a far more visible and public pattern of drug acquisition andconsumption,” were at higher risk for HIV infection.24 So, those who lived in marginalized,inner-city communities were more susceptible to drug use, rendering them more vulnerable toHIV infection.In 2019 the novel coronavirus, SARs-CoV-2, metamorphosed into a global pandemic,interacting with HIV/AIDS, drug and alcohol addiction, and mental illness to disproportionatelyimpact queer homeless youth. Furthermore, systems of oppression such as racism, ableism,homophobia, transphobia, and classism have acted as causal drivers for the negative healthoutcomes of queer homeless youth within this specific syndemic. Institutionalized racism isdefined by David Williams, who stated that, “the processes of racism that are embedded in laws(local, state, and federal), policies, and practices of society and its institutions that provideadvantages to racial groups deemed as superior, while differentially oppressing, disadvantaging,or otherwise neglecting racial groups viewed as inferior.”25 This definition may provide aframework for how state violence intersects with systems of oppression and syndemic theory toaggregate serious negative health impacts in specific populations. How this pertains to queerhomeless youth will be explored. Syndemic theory further recognizes that the impacts ofpoverty:(1) enduring stress associated with poverty, unemployment, stigmatization,marginalization, residential instability, and population density; (2) dietinsufficiency (especially early in life) and malnourishment; (3) frequent exposureto street crime and violence; (4) demoralization associated with living in adeteriorating social environment; (5) exposure to man-made toxins produced byaging and ill-repaired housing structures; and (6) the adoption of behaviors such25 Williams, Lawrence, and Davis, 2019, 107.24 Ibid, 44.Young 38as abusive drinking and illicit drug use in order to cope with and medicate theemotional injuries of deprivation, affect the physical ability of the impoverishedto ward off disease.26Fundamental risk factors and causes are the socio-cultural phenomena and institutions thatimpact a person’s health and access to care. This framework may be applied to queer homelessyouth to recognize the fundamental factors and structural violence that influence the health ofqueer homeless youth. Perry Halkitis and Kristen Krause in 2020 concurred with Singer’sanalysis of syndemic, adding that poor self-rated health, experiences of discrimination fromhealthcare providers, mental health illnesses and addiction, all made queer people more likely toexperience homelessness. In respect to SARs-CoV-2, they stated that, “Nested within a syndemicframework, COVID-19 is yet another of the interlocking health problems faced by the populationand is precipitated by the psychosocial burdens which fuel disease.”27 Prior to the COVID-19pandemic, John Ecker’s 2016 analysis of queer homeless youth supports the establishment of asyndemic within queer homeless youth populations and can help us understand the many factorsthat impact homelessness. Ecker found that queer youth had worse outcomes than theirheterosexual peers, in “all other indices, including mental health issues, suicidal behaviors,substance use, sexual victimization, sexual risk behaviors, physical victimization,discrimination/stigma, family relationships, and social relationships.”28 Many youths face theseoutcomes due to fundamental factors. Suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, and other mentalillnesses are caused or made worse by the systems of oppression that inhibit queer youths’abilities to access mental health help, live in a mentally safe and healthy home, and be medicatedcorrectly. The role of the COVID-19 pandemic as a causal driver for this confluence of illnessesis noted.28 Ecker, 2016.27 Halkitis and Krause, 2020, 249.26 Ibid. 135.Young 39The Path ForwardIn this thesis I aim to compare and analyze HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 in queer homelessyouth populations from 1981 to 2021. A syndemic framework is applied to address commoncomorbidities that exist in queer homeless youth populations, with a focus on socio-culturalphenomena that rendered homeless queer youth susceptible and vulnerable to HIV/AIDS,COVID-19, drug and alcohol abuse, mental health struggles, and tobacco use. Chapter 2 outlinesthe historical context of queer youth homelessness and addresses the structures and systems ofoppression that pushed youth to the streets. A decline in available welfare and the continuouslack of resources left many queer youths with few housing options. The policing of queer bodiesand its impact on homelessness will be explored using Brandon Andrew Robinson’s queercontrol complex which maps how “institutions and institutional actors’ police and criminalizeexpansive expressions of gender and signs of homosexuality.”29 The understanding thathomophobia and the policing of queerness are causal drivers for homelessness will lead into adiscussion of how queer homeless youth have been impacted by the HIV/AIDS and COVID-19pandemics. Using syndemic framework, I will expand this analysis to address the multifacetednature of these interrelated health crises. Throughout this thesis I use narratives of homelessnessto describe the social and cultural phenomena that rendered queer youth susceptible tohomelessness. Many of these stories describe extreme violence, racism, and homophobia. Thesestories are shared to recognize the realities that many displaced youths face(d), they are notshared to paint queer youth as an exhausted and abused population. Furthermore, it is paramountthat the reader acknowledges that it is not simply abuse and hatred that cause queer youth29 Robinson, 2020, 80.Young 40homelessness; the prevalence of poverty in the United States of America and the abject lack ofwelfare supports play a critical role.Chapter 3 will address the syndemic that has impacted homeless queer youth populationsduring the HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 crises. The HIV/AIDS pandemic of the 1980s to 1990swill be analyzed through a historical lens. HIV/AIDS will be compared to the COVID-19pandemic, which will be historicized upon reflection of 2019 to 2021 data. Chapter 3 presents aroadmap of existing comorbidities for later analysis. It is in list format to function as a referencefor Chapter 4 and my analysis of how disease is moralized in queer homeless youth populations.In Chapter 4 I apply Susan Sontag’s construction of the at-risk identity in AIDS and itsMetaphors to COVID-19, comparing the usage of metaphors and identities to discuss how queerhomeless youth have been held individually responsible for their infections. The analysisdemonstrates that queer homeless youth are negatively impacted by a societal perception ofdeservedness, i.e., that they deserve their HIV+ diagnosis due to engagement in risky behavior.The demonization of queer homeless youth during the HIV pandemic is well documented andparallels what queer homeless youth have faced from 2019-2021. The construction ofdeservedness has enabled an individualistic approach to disease mitigation, thereby condemningqueer homeless youth to suffering and truncated life.30 As such, I will compare HIV metaphorsand at-risk identities to COVID-19 to demonstrate how the social and political conceptions ofdisease continue to influence overall health outcomes. Looking forward, to best support queerhomeless youth today it is paramount that we recognize the dangerous histories of diseasemoralization. Furthermore, the needs of queer homeless youth may be better understood throughthe framework of syndemic. Homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, mental health struggles,30 James Tyner in 2015 describes the phenomena of death before average life expectancy as “truncated life.” Heattributes truncated life to social inequalities that impact health and access to healthcare.Young 41tobacco use, HIV infection, and COVID-19 infection are multidirectional. These facets of lifeimpact one another to shape the health outcomes of the individual. To adequately support queerhomeless youth and mitigate disease, death, and suffering, one must recognize the relationshipbetween comorbidities and the sociocultural phenomena at play. I implement comparativeanalysis of HIV and COVID-19 to demonstrate a need for accessible and affordable health carefor queer homeless youth. The existing crises have amplified the impact of an unjust healthcaresystem. I will conclude with a discussion of the public health implications learned from studyingthe syndemic impacts of homelessness, HIV, and COVID-19. I hope that my comparativeanalysis amplifies the voices that have consistently called for change by providing anotheravenue for understanding the dangers of disease moralization.Young 42Chapter 2A Brief History of Queer Homelessness in the United States of America: 1980-2020The epidemic of homelessness that so disproportionately impacts queer youth arose froma weakening of national welfare, the interaction of comorbid drug and alcohol addiction, mentalhealth struggles, and social ostracization in various and violent forms. Homelessness is a broadterm, defined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)as, “individuals and family groups… living in shelters or transitional housing programs(‘sheltered’), temporarily residing with friends or family members (‘doubled up’), or living inunconventional locations not intended as residential, such as abandoned buildings or public areas(‘unsheltered’).”31 Many people became susceptible to homelessness in the early 1980s due to“declining personal incomes, loss of affordable housing, deep cuts in welfare programs, and agrowing number of people facing personal problems.”32 Available manufacturing jobs shrunkconsiderably while low-skill, low-wage jobs grew. Snow, Soule, and Cress in 2005 stated thatthere was a correlation between the declining number of manufacturing jobs and the increasingpoverty rate in each of the seventeen United States cities they studied from 1980 to 1990. In thereview they explained that “a study by the U.S. Department of Labor (1985) reports, forexample, that nearly twelve million workers lost jobs between 1979 and 1985 because of plantclosings and associated employment cutbacks. Given that these closings and cutbacks, oftendiscussed under the rubric of ‘deindustrialization, ‘have been posited as precipitants ofhomelessness we hypothesize that a decline in manufacturing jobs should be positivelyassociated with greater frequency of homeless protest.”33 This is corroborated by Moyinhan who,33 Snow, Soule, and Cress, 2005.32 Jennifer Wolch et al., 2017.31 Giano et al., 2020.Young 43in 1988, stated that “Recent census data indicate that 25% of children under the age of six areliving in families with annual incomes at or below the poverty level.”34,35 Furthermore, “thesechanges were concurrent with the retrenchment of social welfare policies and diminishedaffordable housing. Over one million single-room occupancies (SROs) – one of the biggestforms of low-income housing– went away from the 1970s into the early 1980s, often because ofgentrification.”36 This discussion is furthered by Brandon Andrew Robinson, who in 2020 foundthat,Along with gentrification and the decrease in affordable housing, the decline inmanufacturing jobs that resulted from globalization and the deindustrialization ofUS society moved the economy into a service industry, whereby wages becamelow and stagnant as inflation continued to grow. At the same time, welfare reformslashed poverty assistance, and lawmakers dramatically reduced the federalbudget for subsidized housing. The amount of people experiencing homelessnessgrew because of these larger economic shifts in US society, not because morepeople have become alcoholics or have mental health challenges than in thepast.37Robinson raises an important facet of understanding homelessness; drug and alcohol abuse existcomorbidly and may increase susceptibility to homelessness and disease infection, however it isnot the only root cause. Furthermore, mental institutions such as psychiatry wards were victimsof “deinstitutionalization” and patients who had previously been in long-term care were put outonto the streets. Community mental health centers were supposed to replace the large wards, butthis plan never came to fruition, so jails became “de facto mental hospitals,” propelling thecriminalization of poverty.3838 Ibid.37 Ibid, 19.36 Robinson, 18.35 Moynihan, P. “We Must Protect Our Children.”34 Shane, 1989.Young 44Concurrently, the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in June of 1981. Though the earliestconfirmed case was in 1968, it took a cluster of rare and aggressive “cancer” cases in LosAngeles and New York City to spark doctors' attention. On June 5th, 1981, the Center forDisease Control (CDC) published a rare case of lung infection in the Morbidity and MortalityWeekly Report. On June 16th the very first AIDS patient, a young gay man, was admitted to theClinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where he later died.39 At the beginningof the pandemic, the “four H’s” were believed to be susceptible: hemophiliacs, homosexual men,heroin users, and Haitians.40 This misguided belief was wildly and harmfully inaccurate, layingthe foundation for the pervasive discrimination that still surrounds HIV/AIDS and impactshousing accessibility and stability today.The flower-child stereotype of homeless youth from the 1970s was replaced by anincreasing understanding that homeless youth were less frequently running “toward [rather] thanaway from something.”41 Instead of running away for a lifestyle change, they were “often[running] from a place and life in which the runaways felt abused, rejected, unheard, unwanted,and unhappy.”42 In 1981 L.L. Dye introduced the intersections of homelessness, gender andsexuality deviance, and victimization as antecedents of homelessness, stating,  “An investigationof 60 female sex workers in San Francisco revealed that 80% of women had been either victimsof incest, sexual abuse, or rape prior to prostitution; and 65% had run away from home in theiryouth.”43 This followed Gabe Kruks’ suggestion that “identifying as a sexual minority may beassociated with homelessness” after highlighting that, “in a children’s homeless shelter in Los43 Dye, 1981.42 Lipschutz, 1977.41 A youth movement that involved youth leaving home, feeling the “pull” to cities that had vibrant youthcommunities and few restrictions. (Lipschutz, “Runaways in History.”)40 Currie, D.S.W., and Horn, 2020.39 “A Timeline of HIV and AIDS” 2016.Young 45Angeles, 72% of young men involved with prostitution identified as gay.”44 Kruks’ researchrevealed the first understandings of the relationship between sexuality and housing insecurity.Kruks’ findings have remained consistent through the past four decades, as “a study of 334runaway youth in San Francisco, Moon and colleagues found that LGBT youth reported runningaway at an earlier age, which was associated with later homelessness. They also found higherlevels and earlier use of both sexual and drug-using behaviors among LGBT youth compared toheterosexual youth.”45 This pattern was exacerbated for transgender youth whose risk ofhomelessness was double that of their cis-gendered peers. Giano et al., in a literature review offorty years of homelessness predictors, attributed this to “experiences of discrimination, lack ofaccess to health care, social services, and [a] possible denial of services.”46 Overall, queer youthleft home in response to serious harm, in search of more accepting and non-violentenvironments. However, syndemic theory shows how homelessness “opens the door toconditions that often amplify problems already in play in the lives of children and youth (e.g.,abuse at the hands of parents/guardians, struggles in school). More expansively, homelessnessleads to living conditions that fuel existing problems and power up new ones.”47 To understandthe impacts of homelessness, we must understand its casual drivers. Homelessness does notsimply disproportionately impact queer youth because of weakening welfare, but because of thecriminalization of poverty, systems of oppression such as homophobia, the policing of queerexpression, and the stigmatization of disease.47 Murphy and Tobin, 2014.46 Ibid, 702.45 Giano et al. 2020, 700.44 Kruks, 1991.Young 46The Impact of Conditional Love: Narratives of Queer Youth Homelessness“I love you all brothers and sisters, but I love you to a certain degree” 48Image 1: The cast of Friendly Fire.

The understanding thatdeviance from heterosexuality may be a causal factor for homelessness introduces the need for adeeper analysis of what social and cultural factors are influential in displacement. Rampanthomophobia has impacted queer youths’ abilities to feel safe both at home and in traditionalhomeless shelters. Friendly Fire is an anthology of three plays (People who Live in GlassHouses, Street Dish, and Friendly Fire) written, produced, and performed by queer street youthin the early 1990s that provides an intense look into the many nuances of what it meant to beyoung, queer, and houseless in the United States. The plays were a collaboration between theL.A. Gay and Lesbian Center, the Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services (GLASS),directors Norma Bowles and Ernie Lafky, and many queer homeless youths, whose stories,writings, art, and performances shaped the production. The plays took place over a three-yearperiod, from 1990 to 1993. Various queer street youth were involved with the plays which tookplace at Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, CA. Street Dish, first presented inAugust of 1992, was a lengthy play that examined survival on the streets as well as the regulationand demonization of the queer body through themes of drug use, sexual assault, domesticviolence, and sex work. In the scene, “My Last Breakfast at Home” written and acted by Marcus“Boy Diva” Alston Lopez, Marcus utilized monologue to recount his mother’s reaction tofinding out her child was gay from her nephew, Miguel, who openly identified as gay. Miguelhad seen Marcus at the Sound Club, a “very big, very gay club” and immediately proclaimed thathe would out Marcus to his mother.49,50 Marcus remembered:So, the next day when I come home, my mom has breakfast ready. She fixes mybreakfast: orange juice, steak, eggs, the whole nine yards… and she’s calm at thispoint. Then she slams my plate on the table and says ‘I hope you enjoy it becausethis will be the last mother-fucking meal you ever eat in this house, you fucking50 To “out” a person is to publicly disclose their non-heterosexual identity without explicit permission.49 Ibid, 54.Young 49faggot!’ My father proceeds down the steps with an army knife and stabs me inthe arm. Mom tells me that my shit is already packed. The last thing she told mewas ‘I should have let your stepfather kill you, but I figure that a faggot won’tamount to anything.’ So, I took my bags and life and I’ve been gone ever since.51Marcus’ mother and father had a violent reaction, made all the more bitter with the use of slurs.The use of the slur “faggot” creates artificial distance between the parents and their child,transforming Marcus from family into an alien and undesirable entity. Their decision tocompletely reject their child and ostracize Marcus was rooted in homophobia; the application ofthe term faggot implies an explicit disparaging of any deviance from the cis-gender, heterosexualnorm. Though cousin Miguel was accepted by the family as openly gay, Marcus’ parents wereunable to reconcile with raising a queer child, resulting in Marcus’ displacement and eventualhomeless status. Though Marcus did not explain whether it was social pressures, generalcommunity behaviors, or personal disgust that triggered his family’s homophobia (or why hiscousin felt the need to out him), his story falls within a chorus of queer youth who were andcontinue to be outcast because of their identity.Many youths who experienced physical and emotional violence at home had little to nosupport. Sassafras Lowrey details displacement narratives in her anthology, Kicked Out. Thebook, published in 2010, is a compilation of stories by and about queer homeless youth. Onesuch story in the anthology, titled Tangled Hair, illustrates barriers to aid. Booh Edouardo tellstheir story of abandonment in Tangled Hair describing frequent physical abuse from their fatherdue to gender deviance, such as wearing pajama pants under a dress to church as a toddler. Aftera particularly violent episode Edouardo searched for help, to no avail. Bruised, muddy, and hairfull of twigs from sleeping in a park, they entered a police station at night. Here we enter into aportion of their memory:51 Ibid, 54.Young 50My throat is dry, and I have trouble swallowing. I tell the policeman that myfather has hurt me, and that I am afraid for my life. I push my tangled hair backfrom my face and look up at him, but he doesn’t seem to notice me.The policeman glances down and then continues to write. He says that I can file apolice report if I want to, but that it won’t do any good. Perhaps I have made upmy story and need time to rethink it. He tells me that after I make the complainthe has to lock me up in juvenile hall where I will stay for an indefinite period. AsI climb back up the stairs, I try to fill myself up by gulping in the warm eveningair.The Catholic Church that my parents belong to is nearby, I think. Perhaps thepriests will help me since they know my parents, and my parents like them. As Iwalk across the entryway, the lights over the front door of the rectory come on asif to welcome me. I ring the bell, and a man answers from a box that hums.‘Can I help you?’ the voice crackles. I explain how I am a student at the schooland a member of the church, and that my father has injured me. I ask for help andwait for the man’s answer hoping that someone will open the front door. Finally,the box hums again and the man says, ‘Go away. No one here will help you.’52The resistance to aid that Booh Edouardo faced is reflective of the ways American society hasoutcast deviant children. Here, deviance is in the display of both gender discretion and the publicacknowledgement of domestic violence which was expected to be kept quiet. The adults thatEdouardo went to were unwilling to overcome this social norm and recognize the domestic abuseor intervene. Furthermore, the police office’s policy of locking children in a juvenile hall afterreporting abuse only encouraged them to stay silent. Edouardo faced an impossible choice – totrade one form of violence and neglect for another. Their story continued –once eighteen theyleft home and in the absence of family support, money, or power, Edouardo became homeless.Edouardo’s story should not be seen as a generalized experience, nor should one take away thatall queer homeless youth faced extreme abuse. Rather, it should illuminate the nuancedchallenges many queer youths faced that contributed to homelessness.52 Sassafras 2010, 102-107.Young 51Outside of the home, homophobia, and social stigma towards queerness, intensified byHIV/AIDS stigma, impacted how youth were treated in homeless shelters. In a striking exampleA youth named [Q] suffered extreme abuse after seeking shelter at the Covenant House in NewYork City.53 Q was in the process of hormone replacement therapy and was kicked out of herfamily home for doing so. Bill Torres, the director of Community Resources at the Ali ForneyCenter (AFC), remembers the haunting story of what came after her ID was shown to theCovenant House staff, revealing that she had been assigned male at birth:[they] forced [Q] to strip off [her] clothes and put [her] naked into a closet. Otherstaff members would randomly pass by and open the closet door to get a glimpseof sensation out of the “chick with a dick”. After a while the staff finally pushed[Q], still naked, into the male section of the shelter. The male attendants startedyelling at her to stay away from the beds because they did not want “AIDS on thesheets.” ... Eventually, she was brutally beaten, molested and urinated upon andrealizing the situation they were in, the shelter staff didn’t hesitate to put her in acab and force her to leave.54What happened to Q highlights the utter lack of resources available to queer homeless youth dueto uncertain safety in shelters.55 It is not just that there are few shelters available for homelessyouth, but that within the few, many are unsafe due to histories of homophobia and violence. Assuch, Q’s story is just one within a long history of mental and physical abuses perpetrated againstqueer folks. Homophobia as a fundamental risk factor for displacement from homeless shelters isa modern-day issue as well. Brandon Andrew Robinson’s fieldwork in LGBT+ shelters revealedthat the same homophobia that caused youth to be kicked out of their homes impacted theirabilities to stay in shelters. He introduces the term, the queer control complex, which maps how“institutions and institutional actors’ police and criminalize expansive expressions of gender and55 Here it is important to restate that even though homeless shelters were available, due to homophobia, racism,sexism, etc. they were objectively unsafe and therefore not a viable option for homeless people seeking shelter.54 Lubotsky et al., 2009.53 Name changed to protect identity.Young 52signs of homosexuality.”56 Homeless shelters may have dress codes, codes of conduct that restrictlanguage, and punishments for “gender transgressions” that inhibit the ability for queer youth toauthentically live and survive. If youth rebel against these restrictions they may be put out ontothe streets, forcing them to engage with survival sex to simply live or using drugs and alcohol tocope with systematic rejection.57 The homonormative governmentality and queer necro politics(accepting some queer folks and violently ostracizing others) impact the likelihood of youthbecoming homeless or remaining in unstable and transient housing. The shelters that policeassumed nonheterosexuality act as fundamental causes for youths increased susceptibility tohomelessness and vulnerability to the comorbidities that accompany homelessness. Celson, ahomeless queer youth from the American South, elaborated on this, saying, “It’s a lot harder[being gay while homeless] ... you have to calculate each decision with not only a straight pointof view but a safety point of view, because most people on the streets just jump at things… Thereis hardly anything I can do.”Adam Romero, Shoshana Golderb, and Luis Vasquez corroborated the impact of systemicoppression on housing security and homelessness in 2020 with an analysis of contemporaryLGBT housing affordability, discrimination, and homelessness. They found that queer youthdisproportionately face housing instability and homelessness due to: family rejection,sexual-orientation based discrimination by landlords, mortgage lenders, long- term care facilities,and other housing providers, as well as discrimination and bullying at school and/or work, andthe effects of being denied the financial benefits of marriage.58 Furthermore, they found that“LGBT people are more likely than non-LGBT people to be poor, to be renters, to have unstable58 Romero et al., 2020.57 Survival sex will be explained in depth in Chapter 4. It is defined as sex for money, food, drugs, safety, shelter, orother necessities. The practice is also known as transactional sex.56 Robinson, 2020.Young 53housing, and to be homeless.”59 The disproportionate impact of housing instability on queerpeople is intensified by discrimination and inadequate policy present in the United States fostercare system. Zachary Giano analyzed homelessness predictors and found that:among 265 youth who exited foster care and did not secure stable housing, 20%were chronically homeless within two years. Much like Slesnick et al., Fowler’sstudy emphasizes the importance of secure and stable housing post-transition outof state/foster care systems, and posits that housing issues among youth areassociated with behavioral problems, victimization, criminal activity, anddropping out of high school.60Importantly, foster care had little impact on homelessness after aging out.61 With no supportsystem, youth have few options to sustain housing security once they are removed from thefoster care system. Giano et al. explain that “a key governmental policy that extended the releaseof foster care youth to age 21 was largely ineffective. Although it did limit homelessness inyouth up until age 21, it did not appear to reduce the risk of homelessness by age 24. A striking22% of youth that exit foster care became homeless within 30 months.”62 The foster care systemmakes children “wards of the state” and moves them away, sometimes quite far from theircommunities, and then provides no stability or support upon adulthood. With these conditions,how many youths have any chance for success? Without accessible health care or affordableeducation youth are faced with crippling economic debt. With rising rent, gas, and food costs anda stagnant minimum wage there are few avenues for homeless and post-foster care youth tomaintain savings, if they have any at all.While in the system, many foster youths are abused, discarded, or passed around. Dr.Andrew Robinson interviewed a few in their larger Texas case study. Alaina, a nineteen-year-old62 Ibid.61 “Aging out” of foster care refers to becoming too old to remain in the program and receive foster-care specificassistance.60 Giano et al., 2020.59 Ibid, 2.Young 54Hispanic lesbian from Texas, remembered her placement in a psychiatric hospital after her fosterparent’s found out that she is queer. “’Cause I was with a girl still, [the foster parent’ didn’t wantme there. She ended up putting me in a hospital in Dallas. Usually when we act up, and theydon’t want to deal with us no more, they put us in a hospital.”63 Adelpha, an eighteen-year-oldBlack, Mexican, and white transgender woman expanded on this: “say a foster home doesn’twant you there no more. They have thirty days – like your caseworker has thirty days to comeget you. But if they send you to a mental hospital, it automatically relinquishes their rights toyou. So, they don’t have to wait the thirty days.”64 It is not just that foster care children aremoved from placement to placement – they are forcibly hospitalized. What little autonomy theydo have as wards of the state is completely dissolved once they are deemed undesirable oruncontrollable. The youth continued recounting their experience in the system, stating: “It’s soeasy for an adult to send a kid to a mental hospital. ’Cause they’re not going to listen to you.They’re going to listen to the adult.”65It is critical to note that instability for youth included far more than abuse and the fostercare system. For many, it came from:parental romantic transitions, residential movement, changing schools, theincarceration of a parent, the fracturing of social ties, and other major stressorsthat accumulate across a child’s life. Poverty and instability – two sides of thesame coin – [give] devastating consequences for families, generating stress,depression, and other mental health challenges, as well as drug and alcohol use,familial conflict and abuse, strained familial ties, and other disrupting familydynamics.66Poverty has a massive impact on instability. It is not just homophobia and discriminatorypractices that have impacted the housing security of youth, it is also the abject lack of66 Ibid, 35.65 Ibid, 65.64 Ibid, 65.63 Robinson, 65.Young 55support systems and welfare in the United States. Furthermore, it must be mentioned thatthe point of this thesis is not to make queer youth out to be a dejected, hopeless, andviolated population. That would be infantilizing and incorrect. However, it is necessary tobring light to the many ways systemic oppression and discrimination have and continueto affect the health of queer youth. As such, histories of harm are essential inunderstanding queer youth homelessness.Queer youth homelessness positions youth to be at risk for many physicalailments. The discussion of syndemic, the aggregation of multiple epidemics in apopulation due to environmental and social factors that impact disease interaction, laysthe foundation for why queer youth have been disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDSand COVID-19. However, it is not that homelessness causes drug abuse, and then drugabuse causes infection, and that infection causes mental health struggles, but that therelationship between these epidemics is multi-directional. Giano et al. recognize this,stating that “frequent drug use and HIV/AIDs status are strong predictors forhomelessness in a study of 2452 individuals with a history of injection drug use.Evidence from this study also found that depressive state and loss of job due to thecurrent health condition may amplify the risk of homelessness, particularly among thosewho use drugs and identify as HIV/AIDS positive.”67 They continued, explaining that:Homelessness with a mental illness appears to stem from a “double dose'' ofdisadvantage: poverty with the addition of family instability and violence as achild… among homeless individuals with a mental illness, those who experiencedhomelessness prior to developing (or diagnosing) mental health problems had thehighest levels of disadvantage; whereas those who became homeless afteridentifying mental illness have a particularly high prevalence of alcoholdependence.6868 Ibid.67 Giano et al., 700-1.Young 56As will be further explored in Chapter 3, comorbidities interact and heighten susceptibility andvulnerability to HIV infection, COVID infection, drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, andtobacco use. The social and cultural factors that are fundamental risk factors for queer youthhomelessness impact the likelihood of queer youth becoming physically sick. Understanding thenuances of why so many queer youths are homeless provides a framework for the existence ofsyndemic within queer homeless youth populations.Young 57Chapter 3Syndemic Theory: The Comorbidities Present in Queer Homeless Youth PopulationsQueer homeless youth have faced many barriers to positive health outcomes. Theinteraction and simultaneous presence between diseases and medical conditions in a patient areknown as comorbidities. These comorbidities alter the overall health and mortality of apopulation and exist within the framework of syndemic; the impact of co-existing conditionsilluminates why syndemics have the potential to be so devastating. Syndemic theory recognizesthat systems of oppression act as causal drivers for the aggregation of illness and disease in apopulation – resulting in negative health outcomes.69 Queer homeless youth populations areimpacted by the interactions between drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, smoking, and theHIV/AIDS and COVID-19 pandemics. Social conceptions of queer homeless youth impact theirvulnerability and susceptibility to disease as well as impact resource allocation, as described inChapter 4. However, before understanding the ways that queer health and bodies are moralized,it is imperative to understand the public health environment that queer youth have existed withinfor forty years.Mental Health StrugglesMental health struggles have persisted over generations in the queer community. Inhomeless populations queer youth are disproportionately likely to suffer from chronic mentalillnesses, such as depression. A Department of Health and Human Services report on HIV from1990 found that street youth were twice as likely to suffer from a chronic disease compared totheir housed counterparts and 89% of HIV+ youth either attempted suicide or engaged in suicidal69 Singer, 80Young 58ideation.70 Queer youth have consistently been found to have high rates of mental health issues.Among homeless queer youth, gay-identifying males were more likely to have internalization,which is internalizing societal norms such as heterosexuality into outward identity, whilelesbian-identifying females “were more likely to have symptoms of post-traumatic stressdisorder, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and substance abuse” when compared to theirheterosexual counterparts.71 This is important when recognizing that the relationship betweentrauma and abuse is bidirectional; that is to say homelessness may be a consequence of trauma.72Image 3: Gabriel Aceves (left), Crisanto Monterroso and Caitlin Stansbury (behind) in“Blue Love” a scene in “Friendly Fire.” Photo by Paula Goldman. 1993.Friendly Fire, a play included in the anthology mentioned in Chapter 2 was produced,directed, and performed by queer street youth in 1993. It reflects upon the homes that these queeryouth came from and why they left. Friendly Fire is a painful account of physical, mental, andsexual abuse that calls into question traditional family values. In the scene “Blue Love” the cast72 Edidin et al., 2012, 356.71 Gangamma et al., 2008, 2.70 Chaffee, 1990, 6-7.Young 59interrogates the intersections between homophobia, displacement, and mental struggles. With thenoise of a party as a backdrop, Kym recounts her suicide attempt:At the age of fourteen, in 1988, my sister Elaine kicked me out of the house for alot of reasons. The first one was because my sister Linda, next to me, kept ontalking shit about our family, then blamed me. The second was because of mygrades, and the last one was because I was a lesbian. Elaine came home andcaught me and my girlfriend Anthony in my room, so we left. I went to thehospital for four months and twelve days for drinking bleach.73Tense family relations and ostracization due to sexual identity constructed a “perfect storm” forKym’s mental health crisis. Unfortunately, she is not alone. Tyler Hatchel et al., researchedpredictors of suicidal ideation and attempts in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Theyfound that the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS), which “posits that suicidal ideation isinfluenced by two interpersonal experiences: feeling that one does not belong to meaningfulrelationships and groups (i.e., thwarted belongingness) and that one is a burden on others (i.e.,perceived burdensomeness)” can explain why queer youth are at such high risk. Thwartedbelongingness can arise from loneliness due to bullying and/or victimization, and perceivedburdensomeness is realized through self-hatred and “feeling like a liability to others, which isalso experienced by LGBTQ youth, specifically when ‘coming out’ to their friends and family.”74Prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in queer youth populations is furthered by theMinority Stress Theory (MST) which posits that “internalized bias, specifically internalizedhomophobia, is a common manifestation of minority stress characterized by individuals withsexual minority identities internalizing societal homophobia.”75 Hatchel et al., explain that theMST may account for the huge of number of queer youth who have high levels of depression,anxiety, and drug use. Following national trends, the youth in their study were using anything75 Ibid.74 Hatchel et al., 201973 Bowles, 106Young 60from marijuana, to cocaine, methamphetamines, hallucinogens, street and prescription opioids,and sedatives to self-medicate.76,77 Hatchel et al. conclude with a discussion on intersectingvulnerabilities, stating:IPTS suggests that LGBTQ youth are at greater risk for suicidal ideation becausepeer victimization and rejection increase thwarted belongingness and perceivedburdensomeness; MST points to the chronic stress associated with being a genderor sexual minority as a result of stigmatizing social contexts, such as school.Thus, depression, peer victimization, help-seeking beliefs and intent to use drugswere examined as predictors of both suicidal ideation and attempts.78The relationship between drug use and suicidal ideation is significant and impacts HIV andCOVID-19 infection rates. Mental health struggles’ may be understood as a causal factor of druguse in queer youth populations. The prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse is further explored atthe end of this chapter.The stress of being homeless causes both physical and mental harm. In the case ofHIV/AIDS specifically, high stress levels and high stress lifestyles accelerate the progression ofHIV into AIDS. Gail Ironson found that stress predicted viral load increases even with adherenceto antiretrovirals. Further, “high cumulative depression and avoidant coping were associated withapproximately twice the rate of decline in CD4 as low scorers and greater relative increases in[viral load].”79 Researchers at North Carolina Chapel Hill showed that HIV+ men that hadexperienced high stress events developed AIDS at higher rates than their “non-stressed”counterparts.80 Dr. Jane Lesserman explained, “we showed that for every increase in cumulativeaverage stressful life events - equivalent to one severe stressful event or two moderate stressfulevents - the risk of AIDS was doubled.\"81 The increase in risk is troubling as many homeless81 Ibid.80 Stress Speeds Progression To AIDS, 1999.79 Ironson et al., 2005.78 Ibid.77 Keuroghlian et al., 2014.76 Hao et al., 2021.Young 61queer youth are already infected with HIV. A 1991 Department of Health and Human Servicesreport stated that, “74,550 young people between the ages of 13 and 24 are currently infected,including those with AIDS. This is a rate of 1.8/1 000. The rate varies fourfold betweendemographic groups, from 0.8/1 000 for females both 13-18 and 19-24 to 4. 1/1 000 for 19- to24-year-old males.”82 The risk of HIV/AIDS may be increased by the severe lack of sleep thataccompanies the homeless lifestyle. During sleep cytokines, which are needed when fightinginfection, inflammation, or stress, are released by the immune system. Production of thesecytokines and other antibodies is decreased when the body experiences sleep deprivation.83Image 4: Tiffany “Life” Coco, sleeping on a subway in New York City. 2011. Filmed byIn the Life Media.83 Olson, 2018.82 Chaffee et al., 1989, 4.Young 62With subsequent deterioration in immune system function, the progression of HIV to AIDS maybe more rapid and the ensuing symptoms may be intensified. Homeless queer youth are unable toachieve adequate rest, as is described by Tiffany “Life” Coco, a youth from New York City. Shesaid, “It’s scary. It took a very big toll on me emotionally. I never got like full hours of rest. Iwould doze off, wake up, check my surroundings, doze off … and it was just constant. Theteenager or pre-teen sitting next to you on the train - you think they’re taking a nap coming homefrom school when that’s their sleep for the day. Just so that they can stay up at night and makesure they’re okay and nothing bad happens to them.”84 By 2011, Life had been homeless forseven years. The lack of sleep that homeless queer youth face may impact their immune systemscausing a faster progression of HIV to AIDS. Furthermore, inadequate rest can worsen orelongate symptoms of depression, anxiety, OCD, and other mood disorders. Homeless youth whoare susceptible to deficient sleep become vulnerable to worsened mental and physical conditions.Mental Health Struggles and COVID-19When the COVID-19 pandemic began, many queer youths were isolated and displaceddue to poverty, mental illness, and homophobia. Like HIV, certain behaviors increase risk oftransmission and infection. These behaviors, known as COVID-19 risky behaviors includeclose-contact indoors, forgoing a mask in indoor and outdoor locations, and physically inhabitingcrowded indoor settings. The pandemic impacted homeless queer youths’ ability to sociallydistance and quarantine, thus forcing youth to engage in COVID-19 risky behaviors. Queeryouth reported, “significantly higher levels of substance abuse, suicide attempts, survival sex,and involvement with child social services.”85 When asked to shelter-in-place, queer youthsuffered at higher rates than their heterosexual peers as the safe spaces of school, clubs, friends’85 Bidell, 2014.84 itlmedia 2011.Young 63houses, or other extracurricular activities became inaccessible. Feelings of isolation werereported to be intensified and familial conflict became a concern.86 One psychological studyreported that, “The closing of K–12 and higher education institutions may confine LGBTQyoung persons to traumatic and possibly abusive environments.”87 Furthermore, funding cuts andquarantine related closures have decreased available support for homeless queer youth. Stevie, a16-year-old, commented on this, saying, “I had a rough time finding places to go when thepandemic happened, a lot of opportunities and just resources shut down for me. I can definitelysay before the pandemic I had a lot more options than I did when it happened.”88 CeCe, a26-year-old who has experienced homelessness, reported on mental health struggles duringshelter-in-place orders, saying:You’re isolating 24/7 with your emotional and psychological and religiousabusers and that has been pretty awful to say the least. I’ve had nervousbreakdowns, I’ve had panic attacks, I’ve had anxiety attacks, I’ve had very severedepressive episodes […] I already suffered with depression and fatigue evenbefore the pandemic, but the fact that I’m constantly being triggered all the time,almost every single day because I’m surrounded by so many religious triggers, it’snot healthy […] And there is no social escape, there is no physical escape.89For CeCe and many others home may not be a safe or secure place for queer youth and so thepandemic may intensify the isolation that many youths were already feeling. John Salerno,Natasha Williams, and Karina Gattamorta concurred with this, stating that queer youthexperience parental rejection, suicide, depression, and parental rejection at high rates, creatinghuge potential for trauma,90 which may lead to the loss of stable housing. The loss of resourceswas exacerbated by the fact that queer people earn less money and have higher rates of poverty90 Salerno, et al., 240.89 “Investigating the Impacts of COVID-19 among LGBTQ2S Youth Experiencing Homelessness.”88 Ibid. .87 Salerno et al., 2020, 240.86 Romero, et al., 2.Young 64than their heterosexual peers.91 This is illustrated in Figure 2 which shows transgender people ofcolor as having higher rates of pay cuts, forced unpaid leave, unemployment, and working hoursreduction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall homelessness was reported to increase from2020 to 2021 and between 2019Figure 2: Effects of COVID-19 on LGBT Subpopulations. Population includedare white LGBT people, LGBT people of color, white transgender people,transgender people of color, and the general population.and 2020 the number of people experiencing homelessness went up by 2%.92 Even more striking,“the number of individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness increased by fifteen percentbetween 2019 and 2020.”93 The 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congressshows the increases and decreases in homelessness in the United States from 2007 to 202093 Ibid. 1, 12.92 “The 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress,” 1.91 Gil et al., 2021.Young 65(Figure 3). From 2007 to 2016 there was a general decrease, however from 2016-on thepopulation of homeless individuals increased steadily. The report stated that, “between 2007 and2020, the number of people experiencing homelessness increased in 16 states, plus the District ofColumbia. The largest absolute increases were in New York (28,670 more people) and California(22,562 more people). New York also had the largest percentage increase (46%), followed byIdaho (32%) and the District of Columbia (20%).” Notably, at any given time in 2020 there werean estimated 580,466 people experiencing homelessness. This may be a severe undercount, asmany individuals are uncounted due to their runaway status or “couch-surfing” practices.Figure 3: Point in Time Estimates of People Experiencing Homelessness in theUnited States. 2007-2020.The queer youth who do stay in shelters have virtually no ability to quarantine or sociallydistance, thus breaking COVID-19 safe practice guidelines and engaging in “COVID-19 risky”Young 66behaviors.94 Wendy Kaplan of the Trinity Place Shelter for LGBTQ youth in New York Cityexpanded on this, stating, “We don't have a private room.”95 However, due to the conditions thatqueer youth are subjected to many have no choice but to stay at shelters for survival. Sheltersthat do attempt to satisfy social distancing regulations have reduced capacity, “leaving LGBTindividuals homeless, or only able to go to shelters that engage in discriminatory practices.”96Furthermore, the engagement in risky behaviors allows others to define queer youth as“deserving” of their diagnosis due to the taboo associated with queer sex and not maintainingproper quarantine.COVID-19 and HIV InteractionDuring mass pandemic events such as HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, these comorbiditiesaffect the incidence with which queer homeless youth become infected. Glenn-Milo Santos, et al.found that the COVID-19 pandemic amplified existing barriers to access to HIV prevention,detection, testing, treatment, and care. Key prevention tools such as free condoms andaccessibility to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)prescription were reduced.97 For queer youth who were displaced, unhoused, or lost employmentin the pandemic, HIV risky behaviors such as survival sex became more necessary.98 These youthwere then exposed to both COVID-19, HIV, and a host of other sexually transmitted diseases andinfections (STD/I) in a time where prevention and detection were harder to access. Santos et al.comment on this, saying, “isolation often occurs with hostile or violent family members, while98 Santos et al. found that, “gay men and other MSM also have disproportionately higher unemployment ratesrelative to the general population. Therefore, COVID-19 disruptions can further heighten the economic barriers.faced by many gay men and other MSM.”97 Santos et al., 2021.96 Konnoth, 2020.95 “Coronavirus Pandemic a Perfect Storm for LGBTQ Homeless Youth.”94 Kuehn, 2020.Young 67LGBT safe-spaces, organizations, institutions, and events, such as LGBT pride and LGBTcenters are shut down or go virtual. This can take a toll on physical, emotional, and mentalhealth, especially for youth and elderly LGBT individuals.”99 As such, they predicted that queerindividuals would be exposed to COVID-19 infection to a greater degree and be more likely tolose access to medical services.For those living with HIV, “unstructured treatment interruptions can lead to increasedHIV viral load, lower CD4 count, HIV disease progression, and increased risk of developing anopportunistic infection.”100 Santos et al. discussed that the consequences of the pandemic weregreater among sex workers, socio-economically disadvantaged groups, and those living withHIV. In conversation with syndemic, they stated that queer folks saw unique challenges duringthe COVID-19 pandemic due to the “mental health impacts resulting from anti-gay communitybacklash, arrests under false pretexts, and loss of privacy during contact tracing and monitoringfor COVID-19.”101 Lisa Bowleg agreed with this, adding that Black individuals would have aharder time accessing PrEP than white counterparts.Drug and Alcohol AbuseConcurrently with mental health struggles, COVID-19, and HIV/AIDS, queer youth areimpacted by drug and alcohol abuse. Just as the relationship between homelessness, mentalhealth struggles, COVID-19, and HIV/AIDS is multidirectional, drug and alcohol abuse impactsand is impacted by the latter. Tyler Hatchel et al. writes that queer youth are at a high-risk fordrug and alcohol abuse as compared to their heterosexual peers. They write that “a recentmeta-analysis identified a significant association between identity-related distress and drug use101 Ibid.100 Ibid.99 Ibid.Young 68among LGBTQ adolescents, highlighting the role of minority stress.”102 As seen in Chapter 2queer youth are often subjected to harm perpetuated by homophobic ideology at both school andhome. School communities are important in facilitating drug use prevention and youth who feel“attached and committed to their school community” uphold norms. “However, once studentsbecome deviant or isolated and no longer feel this obligation, drug use can proliferate and evenbecome a relative norm within deviant groups.”103,104 Drug use is then understood as a product ofcommunity rejection and community building in queer youth groups. Kimberly Tyler concurswith this, stating that, “several studies report that homeless youth who use illicit drugs andengage in risky sexual practices generally have friends who engage in similar behaviors, thusreinforcing the importance of behavioral norms and modeling.”105Drug and alcohol use is utilized as a policing force within the queer control complex.Brandon Andrew Robinson explains that sobriety is expected and enforced at the homelessshelters they studied, even though many of the youth were of legal drinking age. Robinson states:To enter the shelter, the youth had to be completely sober, as they had to blow a0.00 on the breathalyzer to get into the campus. Since a guard searched the bagsand made them go through a metal detector, the youth also could not bring drugsor weapons to the shelter. The staff could also drug test the youth at any time andgo through the youth’s belongings. I – with my volunteer badge – never had to gothrough the metal detector, never had my bag searched, and never blew into abreathalyzer. Only the people experiencing homelessness had to give up certainrights and privacy to be on the campus.106Drug and alcohol use became a tool for staff to hold power over the youth and maintain a privacyimbalance. The double standard present at this shelter shows an infantilization of the queer youthit proclaimed to uplift and serve. Without harm reduction policies the shelter continues a cycle of106 Robinson, 149.105 Tyler, 2013.104 Ibid.103 Here, deviant is used in reference to deviance from heterosexual norms.102 Hatchel et al., 2019.Young 69institutionalized harms. These abstinence-only policies further endanger youth who, statistically,will continue to use drugs. The shelter's stance on drug use forces youth back onto the streetswhere their engagement with substances may worsen and will take place in unsafe conditions.This brings back the bidirectional nature of drug use and homelessness: use may be aconsequence of homelessness and may also be a casual driver of homelessness.107 Zachary Gianoet al. suggest that “frequent drug use and HIV/AIDs status are strong predictors for homelessnessin a study of 2452 individuals with a history of injection drug use.” They further comment on theimpact of syndemic, explaining, “depressive state and loss of job due to the current healthcondition may amplify the risk of homelessness, particularly among those who use drugs andidentify as HIV/AIDS positive.”108 Merrill Singer addressed social factors when discussing druguse within syndemic theory. He theorizes that each syndemic factor interacts, impacting theseverity of the body's response: street drug users, referring to the “marginalized, inner-city drugusers who have been forced by poverty, discrimination, and addiction into a far more visible andpublic pattern of drug acquisition and consumption,” are at higher risk for HIV infection.109HIV+ status is impacted by drug use, homelessness, and poverty.  Kimberly Tyler furthersSinger’s analysis:homeless youth were not only engaging in drug risk behaviors with some of theirnetwork members but what was unique was that some network sanctions andnorms were positively associated with homeless youth engaging in similar HIVrisk behaviors with strangers, suggesting that there are multiple ways homelessyoung people may be at risk for HIV. One risk was through using drugsirrespective of their networks. A second risk was using drugs with their socialnetwork members, which may have been done to avoid sanctions fornon-conformity imposed by members of their peer group.110110 Tyler, 2013.109 Singer, 44.108 Giano et al., 2020.107 Rosario et al., 2012.Young 70The pressures of fitting in are heightened during youth, particularly when accepting communitiesare harder to access. Social and cultural systems of oppression as well as social networknormative behaviors are fundamental causes for drug use in queer homeless youth populations.Furthermore, drug use increases risk for death by suicide. Tyler Hatchel et al., state that,“LGBTQ adolescents were at 1.7 times more likely to endorse suicidal behavior if they reportedfuture drug use and 1.3 times more likely if they reported being victimized by their peers.”111Hatchel et al. continue, stating, “across populations, drug use heightens risk for death by suicideboth acutely and distally. Given the prevalence of direct exposure to bias-based aggression likehomophobia, it is unsurprising that LGBTQ youth face an elevated risk of developing an array ofinternalizing mental health symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, and suicidality) as well asexternalizing symptoms (e.g., problematic drug use).”112 Queer homeless youth aredisproportionately likely to engage in drug use behaviors, increasing their risk of suicidalideation and behavior; queer homeless youth are also disproportionately likely to engage in druguse due to suicidal ideation and behavior. Once again, the syndemic is understood as synergetic.Nicotine Use and Associated RiskNicotine use and cigarette smoking are pervasive among queer homeless youthpopulations. Over 70% of homeless youth smoke cigarettes and LGBT youth are known to bedisproportionately at risk.113,114 A 2007 study by Gary Remafedi found that a third of theirparticipants held the belief that all LGBT youth are at risk for smoking, and that many of theyoung queer cigarette smokers could not imagine queer non-smokers and were not acquaintedwith any.115 Remafedi analyzes this trend, stating that “personal characteristics (i.e., stress,115 Remafedi, 2007.114 Fields, 2021.113 Tucker et al. 2014.112 Ibid.111 Hatchel et al., 2019.Young 71rebelliousness, poor self-esteem, predisposition to addiction, and other substance use),interpersonal issues (i.e., peer pressure, assimilation into LGBT networks, and lack of positiverole models); environmental conditions (i.e., homophobia, hunger, poverty, homelessness, andexposure to second-hand smoke); and structural issues (i.e., tobacco advertisements and lack ofaccess to healthcare and information)” were at fault.116 This trend has persisted, as in 2020Evans-Polce et al. reported that sexual minorities were significantly inversely associated withtobacco use disorder.117 They found an association between sexual minorities, the frequency ofsexual orientation based discrimination, stressful life events, adverse childhood experiences, andodds of comorbidities such as anxiety and mood disorders. They reported that “bisexual womenare at heightened risk for alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use disorders, as well as anxietyand mood disorders, compared with heterosexual women. Men who identified as gay had aparticularly high prevalence of past-year alcohol use disorder and tobacco use disorder. Both gaymen and bisexual men had a significantly higher prevalence of all disorders compared withheterosexual men.”118 Furthermore, the prevalence of co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders andtobacco use disorder was higher in sexual minorities populations. This is not to say that smokingis a symptom of queerness but that queer people are more likely to have life experience that iscorrelated with tobacco use. Using the MST, it is understood that systems of oppression such ashomophobia are causal drivers of substance use. Etern!ty a queer homeless youth whose story isincluded in Kicked Out shared how homelessness impacted their mental health and tobacco use.“Over the next few months, I was jumping from couch to couch, from old friends to friends offriends, getting sick from not eating or sleeping. But I was smoking a whole hell of a lot of118 Ibid.117 Evans-Polce et al., 2020.116 Ibid.Young 72cigarettes. Cutting more than usual… It was horrible. Shit, I was horrible…”119,120 The minoritystress theory helps explain why Etern!ty’s story is a common response to extreme stress andinstability; after being displaced from a physically abusive home and jailed for squatting in anabandoned home, Etern!ty’s frequent tobacco use and cutting is a response to intense emotionalpain. Without any sustained support, they had few options for relief.Tobacco use impacts far more than generalized lung health. HIV+ individuals who smokecigarettes are more likely to be impacted by HIV related infections such as Thrush, Hairyleukoplakia, Bacterial pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia.121 Other illnesses such aschronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, heart disease, Lung cancer, head andneck cancer, cervical cancer, and anal cancer are all more likely in HIV+ patients who smokecigarettes. The negative health consequences of smoking that interact with HIV are also presentin COVID-19 patients. Kevin Hesley and Jeffery Hall in 2021 found that sexual minority groupshad prevalence of underlying health conditions that may increase risk of severe COVID-19infection.122 While there is limited data on COVID-19 and tobacco use in queer homeless youthpopulations, it is known that queer homeless youth disproportionately engage in tobacco use andare at a greater risk of contracting COVID-19.122Heslin, 2021.121 CDC, 2022.120 “Cutting” refers to a self-harm practice in which an individual cuts themselves.119 Sassafras, 136.Young 73Chapter 4AIDS, COVID-19, and the Construction of the At-Risk IdentityThe social construction of disease has innumerable impacts on health and healthcareaccessibility. HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 are two unique examples of how diseases transcendillness and become cultural metaphors for the undesirable and dangerous. In her seminal work,AIDS and Its Metaphors, Susan Sontag analyzes AIDS’ transition from a mystery affliction to aGod-sent apocalyptic disaster. Sontag’s work is a continuation of her discourse on the metaphorssurrounding cancer, where she returns to the historical framework of “disease expressingcharacter and character thus causing disease.” Sontag states that “cancerphobia taught us the fearof a polluting environment; now we have the fear of polluting people that AIDS anxietyinevitably communicates.”123 This conception of ‘polluting people’ sets up a dichotomy between‘clean’ and ‘dirty’: the guilty, raunchy, un-godly AIDS-infected exist to pollute the innocent,pious, white American. This chapter will explore how the metaphors that defined AIDS in the1980s constructed the “at risk” identity for queer homeless youth that inevitably led to aperception of ‘deservedness;’ that is to deserve the disease and the consequences that come withit due to engagement in risky and/or taboo behaviors. Paul Farmer's argument that one cannotconsent when actions are taken for survival lays the framework for why ‘deservedness’ is sodangerous. The moralization of HIV and the construction of “deservedness” for queer HIV+people will be compared to the moralization of COVID-19 and the responsibilities of theindividual in maintaining global public health. Queer homeless youth are held culpable and123 Sontag, 73Young 74blamed for health disasters, while the institutions that maintain poverty, homelessness, andrestrict access to healthcare go unscathed.“The terrorists are now coming to us with a weapon more terrible than Marxism: AIDS”124The moralistic understanding of disease was left behind by modern medicine and thediscovery of bacteria and viruses. One could no longer blame the poor for their “ungodly” livingconditions when it is public knowledge that sewage contaminated water spreads cholera, and it isin fact the state who is responsible for poor sanitation. The introduction of AIDS ushered in thereturn of moralistic understandings of disease, and queerness became synonymous with death.Sontag explores the moral weight of AIDS through the differences in a cancer or AIDSdiagnosis.“‘Why me?’ the cancer patient exclaims bitterly. With AIDS, the shame is linked to animputation of guilt; and the scandal is not at all obscure [… ] indeed, to get AIDS is precisely tobe revealed, in the majority of cases so far, as a member of a certain ‘risk group,’ a communityof pariahs.”125 AIDS is understood as an attack on the body by unsavory peoples that got whatthey deserved. “The unsafe behavior that produces AIDS,” Sontag asserts, “is judged to be morethan weakness. It is indulgence, delinquency – addictions to chemicals that are illegal and to sexregarded as deviant.”126 AIDS the virus is conceptualized as more than an “invader” that targetsvulnerable populations, it is an invader coming from dangerous peoples that has the potential toharm the whole society. The person, not the virus, is the perpetrator of harm. Now, those who areinfected are not simply ill but immoral vectors of disease that threaten ‘good’ people. Sontagexplains that “this logic implicitly makes individuals morally culpable (both self-destructive and126 Ibid, 25.125 Ibid, 24-5.124 Ibid, 62. Stated by Pik Botha the Foreign Minister of South Africa in 1987. Botha made this declaration amidst anAIDS outbreak in mining communities. It is important to note that many of these miners were Black immigrants.Young 75homicidal) for engaging in activities which might result in HIV infections in the absence of a‘cure’ or ‘vaccine. […] AIDS now is understood as the fate of the deviant; some acts, but notothers, engaged in by some classes of people, but not others are the ‘cause’ of ‘AIDS.’”127 Theimplication of AIDS as an inevitable consequence of deviant behavior implies that there is noneed to prevent or help treat AIDS patients. Why would there be, when they chose to engagewith the action (say, anal sex), and got the disease? This framing is irrevocably dangerous.Religious rhetoric fueled metaphoric AIDS discourse. Famously, Jerry Falwell, aprominent American Southern Baptist that came to power as a televangelist, was recordedsaying, “AIDS is God’s judgment on a society that does not live by His rules.”128 Sontagelaborates on the understanding of divine intervention in disease, stating, “considering illness aspunishment is the oldest idea of what causes illness, and an idea opposed by all attention to theill that deserves the noble name of medicine.”129 Statements by Bishop Falcão of Brasilia and theCardinal of Rio de Janeiro, Eugenio Sales, two leading Brazilian clerics, characterized AIDS asboth God and nature's revenge.130 Thereby, AIDS as an infection has been transformed into adefining characteristic for one’s virtue. The metaphors applied to syphilis closely resemble this,as explained by Sontag:Thinking of syphilis as a punishment for an individual’s transgression was for along time, virtually until the disease became easily curable, not really distinctfrom regarding it as retribution for the licentiousness of a community - as withAIDS now, in the rich industrial countries. [… ] AIDS is understood in apremodern way, as a disease incurred by people both as individuals and asmembers of a ‘risk group’ - that neutral-sounding, bureaucratic category whichalso revives the archaic idea of a tainted community that illness has judged.131131 Ibid, 46.130 Ibid, 61.129 Ibid, 45.128 Ibid, 61.127 Ibid, 64.Young 76A tainted community, a deserving few who disgrace others with their actions; AIDS hasreintroduced the ability to blame health crisis on individual behavior. It is then sociallyunderstood that the AIDS patient deserves blame, and even culpability in their prognosis. It is theself-destruction of those who cannot control their desires and who deviantly seek pleasure. “NowAIDS,” Sontag proclaims, “obliges people to think of having sex as having possibly, the direstconsequences: suicide. Or murder.”132 The conception of AIDS through American individualismand morality has altered the accessibility of care. However, what does this mean for queerhomeless youth?HIV/AIDS Risky BehaviorsThe risk of HIV infection varies depending on exposure behavior and viral load. Riskybehavior for HIV infection includes anal and vaginal sex and intravenous drug use and needlesharing.133 A critical “HIV risky” behavior is survival sex, otherwise known as transactional sex.Survival sex is sex in exchange for money, safety, clothing, food, shelter, or drugs. This type ofsurvival behavior, aptly named transmission risk behavior, may be necessary, yet it puts youth indanger of HIV and other STI/D infections, physical abuse, and sexual assault.134 Pushed to thestreets, queer youth have few options for housing and no option but to engage in these “risky”behaviors. As defined in Chapter 2, queer youth who are displaced at a disproportionate ratehave few places to go and few structural supports available. This subjects’ homeless queer youthto unsafe living situations where their vulnerability may be exploited. One youth in Atlantaspoke of their experience with survival sex to stay off the streets, saying, “I slept with one personto the next to the next to the next, performing oral sex or sleeping just to be able to have a place134 Langenderfer-Magruder et al., 2016.133 “HIV Risk Behaviors | HIV Risk and Prevention Estimates | HIV Risk and Prevention | HIV/AIDS | CDC.”132 Ibid, 72.Young 77to sleep for that night so that I wouldn’t be out in the rain or out walking the streets late at night.Very few times was penetration involved. It was more so…it was more so oral and[inaudible].”135 This participant later found that they had contracted HIV.  In 2011, Eugene Wallsand Stephanie Bell found that 9.4% of the LGBT homeless youth had engaged in some form ofsurvival sex (n = 153, sample size = 1,625). Decades earlier in 1987, and following a similarpattern, Gary Remafedi, found that 17% of gay homeless youth were involved in transactionalsex.136 LGBTQ+ youth were also more likely to be asked by another individual to performtransactional sex.137 Further, transgender women and specifically transgender women of colorengaged in transactional sex at disproportionately higher rates than their cis-genderedcounterparts.138 This is congruent with general HIV trends in 1990, where people of color wereinfected with HIV at higher rates, and a shocking 29.3% of all HIV deaths were Black.139Survival sex and AIDS stigma, as described by Sontag, impacts housing security forqueer youth. In turn, this impacts seroconversion rates. Sabine Tigerlily Vasco recounted theirtransition to homelessness after coming out to their parents. Vasco’s mother was incrediblyunsupportive and believed that her child was sentenced to an HIV+ diagnosis purely for beingqueer. Vasco recounts that their mother, “would rather I be a prostitute than be gay because, afterall, being gay meant I would undoubtedly get AIDS.” 140 Here, their mother’s homophobia andcorrelation of AIDS with queerness caused their exile from home. It was impossible for Vasco toremain in an abusive home, however life as a queer homeless youth is not easy.  Leaving anunstable home can render youth vulnerable to exploitation or require them to stay in unsafesituations due to a dire need for shelter. The conditions described in Chapter 2 that drive140 Lowrey, 71.139 “Current Trends Mortality Attributable to HIV Infection/AIDS -- United States, 1981-1990,” 1991.138 Moore et al.137 Ibid.136 VAWnet.org, 2009.135 Moore et al. 2019.Young 78homelessness place youth in circumstances where engagement in risky behavior is necessary forsurvival. Once on the street, a youth recounted the dangers of finding housing, saying:Negotiating the pragmatic and superfluous aspects of life on the streets requiredcreativity and vigilance. Finding food, getting a place to sleep, locating a showerand dying our hair unnatural hues were daily challenges / annoyances. The morevital task was to navigate the myriad potential dangers to one’s physical andpsychological safety posed by the adults who preyed upon discardedadolescents… Our worthlessness was undoubtedly compounded by being queer /gender-variant. A man combed the Tenderloin district for young runaway boysand street hustlers and would offer them shelter and opportunities for gainfulemployment if they would fuck him in exchange.141A Los Angeles based study reported that LGBT students were three times more likely to spendthe night at a stranger’s home than the streets, putting youth at a higher risk of sexualexploitation.142, 143 Furthermore, Gary Remafedi in 1987, found that 17% of gay homeless youthwere involved in transactional sex and that LGBTQ+ youth were also more likely to be asked byanother individual to perform transactional sex.144 It is critical to note that transgender womenand specifically transgender women of color engaged in transactional sex at disproportionatelyhigher rates than their cis-gendered counterparts.In the powerful performance, Friendly Fire, queer homeless youth recount the powerdynamic between those who are offering homeless youth housing and the youth themselves. Inthe scene “Where are You Living, Gary?” Marco offers 18-year-old Gary housing after he hasbeen denied by the Covenant House and Citrus House shelters. Marco knew that Gary did nothave a consistent job, was engaging in survival sex, and did not have a familial or friend supportnetwork. He exploited this, became Gary’s only support, and then moved himself and Gary toCanada where, without a visa, Gary could not legally work. The following scene is aconversation between Gary and Marco where Marco is coercing Gary into having sex:144 Remafedi, 1987.143 Walls and Bell, 2011.142 Rice et al., 2012.141 Ibid, 21.Young 79(MARCO starts fondling GARY)GARY: Quit it!MARCO: (playfully) No.GARY: Yes!!MARCO: Why!?GARY: ‘Cuz I hate it when you do this -MARCO: So?!GARY: Every morning we’ve got to put on the damn porno videos and I’ve got tojack you off… and I don’t get nothing out of it.MARCO: (rolls his eyes)GARY: I’ve told you that: I don't get nothing out of it-MARCO: Where are you living, Gary?GARY: I’m living with you.MARCO: Okay… what food are you eating?GARY: Food that you’re buying.MARCO: (laughing) What clothes are you wearing?GARY: clothes that you bought me.MARCO: So, shut the fuck up.GARY: I’m just sick and tired of it all the time, y’know.

KimberlyTyler studied risk behaviors in youth communities and found that “engaging in drug riskbehaviors may make subsequent participation more likely, especially when pressure, coercion,and/or threats are involved. Due to sheer necessity, some homeless youth who lack food and/orshelter may succumb to trading sex with a stranger in exchange for items they deem necessaryfor their survival.”145 Necessity, seen through Gary’s relational dynamics with Marco, is furtheranalyzed by leading global public health figure, Paul Farmer. In Infections and Inequalities: TheModern Plagues, Farmer argues that limited access to and/or limited ability to increasegenerational wealth, political power and strong labor unions results in an extreme lack of consentand autonomy. There can be no consent to an action when it is taken to ensure survival. As such,Farmer makes the point that doctors and those in power should not hold individuals accountableor responsible for their illness, even when engaging in risky behavior. A critical example of thisis when marginalized people, specifically queer homeless youth, make “HIV risky” decisionsbased on self-preservation. Farmer asserts that people who are facing harm in the forms ofhunger, loss of housing, loss of protection, etc. – all things homeless queer youth faces – areunable to fully consent to the risky acts they engage in. He explains, “...sickness is a result of145 Tyler, 2013.Young 81structural violence: neither culture nor pure individual will is at fault; rather, historically given(and often economically driven) processes and forces conspire to constrain individual agency.”146That is to say, people become vulnerable to disease and infection through social processes andstructural violence; marginalized peoples are impacted by HIV in disproportionate rates due toimpoverishment and oppression rather than an individual failure to abstain from HIV riskybehaviors.Another HIV risky behavior is intravenous drug usage which has an important correlationbetween survival sex and drug usage. Queer homeless youth that use intravenous drugs are at ahigh risk for overdose and engage in high rates of HIV risk behaviors.147 Kristen Ochoa et al. in2001 found that “the subpopulation of young injectors at highest risk for overdosing is the sameas the group at highest risk for HIV infection – those who borrow needles and those who are gayor bisexual. About 79% of reported overdoses were in subjects with one or both of these riskfactors.”148 This corroborates Mary Jane Rotheram-Borus et al.’s 1994 findings of six behavioralpatterns that place queer youth at risk for HIV infection. Firstly, the youth in their study“reported more sexual partners and encounters than the national norm, and those with the largestnumber of male partners were likely to barter sex for money or drugs.” Secondly, “the youthsinitiated sexual activity at an early age.” Third, “the specific sexual acts practiced placed theseyouths at high risk for contracting or transmitting HIV. With male partners, more than threequarters engaged in oral or anal sex and nearly half in anilingus. [...] Receptive anal sex is one ofthe riskiest sexual behaviors for contracting HIV and common among this cohort (with aprevalence of 73%).” Fourth, almost a quarter of the youth in the study engaged in transactionalsex, and fifth many youths used condoms inconsistently: “52% reported never, rarely, or148 Ibid, 458.147 Ochoa et al. 2001, 453–60.146 Farmer, 79.Young 82sometimes using a condom with male partners.” Finally, youth reported frequent alcohol anddrug usage that, “often disinhibits sexual restraints or may lead youths to barter sex to financetheir drug habits.”149 John Noell and Linda Ochs further this discussion, reporting in 2001 that“Lesbian-bisexual females were significantly more likely to have used injection drugs,amphetamines, marijuana, and LSD than heterosexual females. The pattern for recent drug usewas quite different. GLBU status was associated with greater likelihood of amphetamine use andinjection drug use for both males and females.”150,151 Following existing trends they report thatqueer youth have higher rates of drug use and are more likely to initiate risk behaviors andbecome homeless than their heterosexual peers.152 Michele D. Kipke et al. studied HIV riskamong youth peer affiliation groups. Among queer youth they found HIV behaviors to becommon:Overall, 29% of the respondents reported having had sexual intercourse with aninjection drug user, 23% reported having engaged in prostitution/survival sex,21% reported having had unprotected sexual intercourse the last time they had sexwith one of these sexual partners (including an HIV-infected partner), and 31%reported having ever injected drugs, of which 56% reported having engaged inneedle sharing or having used nonsterile or 'dirty' needles. Seventy-nine percentof the respondents reported having ever been tested for HIV…Respondents in thegay/bisexual group were similarly 2.48 times more likely to have had sexualintercourse with an injection drug user and 3.13 times more likely to haveengaged in survival sex or prostitution.153This is consistent with Kimberly Tyler’s literature review of homeless youth risk behaviors. Tylerreported several studies that found that homeless youth were more likely to engage in riskybehaviors if they have friends or a social network that encourages them to. Importantly, Tylerstates that, “having an illicit drug user present in the network was associated with having153 Kipke et al.,  254.152 Ibid. 31.151 GLBU stands for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Unsure.150 Noell and Ochs, 2001, 34.149 Rotheram-Borus et al. 1994, 47–57.Young 83numerous sexual partners and participation in survival sex.”154 The correlation between survivalsex, drug use, and HIV infection is indisputable and disproportionately present in queer homelessyouth populations.Drug and alcohol use have been linked to stress, suicidal ideation, and HIV infection inqueer homeless youth populations.  Moskowitz, Stein, and Lightfoot found that queer youth wereat a high risk of self-harming practices and experienced more stressors than heterosexualcounterparts. Furthermore, they found drug use to be a predictor of suicidal ideation andbehavior.155 Drug use is correlated and impacted by suicidal ideation and poor mental health;often caused by the stressful conditions of homelessness. This is incredibly important as RashmiGangamma et al. found that drug use, such as the use of alcohol, opiates, and marijuana, weresignificant predictors of HIV risk.156The “At Risk” Identity and the Construction of “Deservedness”The labeling of behaviors as “risky” led to the classification of specific populations as“at-risk” due to their increased engagement in these behaviors. The “at-risk” identity isweaponized to place blame on the infected for their diagnosis, negating the systems ofhomophobia that generated the need to engage in risky behaviors for survival. Theacknowledgement that poverty is a policy decision allows for a nuanced conversation on how“vulnerable” and “at-risk” populations are constructed and maintained. The coexistence oftrauma, mental health struggles, and drug and alcohol addiction intersect to influence thefrequency with which queer homeless youth engage in risky behavior. Furthermore, homelessqueer youth engage in risky behaviors due to the lack of support systems and welfare available.156 Gangamma et al., 2008.155 Moskowitz et al., 2013.154 Tyler.Young 84While homeless shelters offer some respite, many are unreliable, physically dangerous, and/or atcapacity. Susan Sontag’s analysis of the demonization of HIV+ individuals illustrate theinfluence of HIV/AIDS stigma on an “at risk” identity for queer homeless youth. Their deviancefrom heteronormativity and typical familial structures as well as their engagement in taboobehaviors leads to a sweeping conception that not only do all queer homeless youth have HIV,but that queer homeless youth deserve HIV. Cindy Patton, in Inventing AIDS, describes how thestigmatization and moralization of HIV and HIV risky behaviors aid in the discrimination ofqueer peoples. When discussing virology she states,This logic implicitly makes individuals morally culpable (both self-destructiveand homicidal) for engaging in activities which might result in HIV infections inthe absence of a ‘cure’ or ‘vaccine… AIDS now is understood as the fate of thedeviant; some acts, but not others, engaged in by some classes of people, but notothers are the ‘cause’ of ‘AIDS.’157When queer youth engage in HIV risky behaviors, such as survival sex and intravenous (IV)drug use, to survive or to cope with their traumas they become “undeserving” of or ineligible foraid. Patton explains how AIDS-related anti-discrimination laws further the acceptance of thequeer “at risk” identity:The orientation toward treating AIDS fundamentally as a disease and not a socialproblem meshed well with the existing public health approach to disease, and laidthe groundwork for several states to include AIDS-related discrimination underexisting disability law, which was sometimes also interpreted to cover peopleperceived to be at risk for AIDS (most often, gay men).158Treating AIDS as a disease rather than a social problem speaks to the disregard of the social andcultural factors that act as causal drivers for HIV/AIDS infection. ‘AIDS as a disease’ means thatan individual [gay men] who engages in risk behaviors [gay sex] is responsible for infection.However, using syndemic theory, it is understood that existing comorbidities such as158 Ibid, 9.157 Patton, 1990, 64.Young 85homelessness, drug and alcohol addiction, mental health struggles, and tobacco use impact howand why queer people engage in HIV risky behaviors. ‘AIDS as a social problem’ then accountsfor the ways that systemic oppression impacts the existing syndemic. Sontag comments on this,stating that “getting the disease through a sexual practice is thought to be more willful, therefordeserves more blame Addicts who get the illness by sharing contaminated needles are seen ascommitting (or completing) a kind of inadvertent suicide.”159COVID-19 Risk Behavior and Infection “Deservedness”As previously defined, COVID-19 is transmitted through aerosols from the nose andmouth that carry the virus. Behaviors that place persons near one another allow for thetransmission of these aerosols from an infected person to another. These COVID-19 riskybehaviors include being in an indoor environment with another person unmasked, being in anindoor environment with another inadequately masked person, sharing saliva with an infectedperson, and being unvaccinated. The United States’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic hasbeen placed on individual responsibility: the individual must socially distance, quarantine,vaccinate, boost, and mask. However, these behaviors are inaccessible to many. Essentialworkers (such as grocery store employees, janitors, plumbers, and other service providers) haveno option but to be exposed to others. There is a disproportionate number of marginalizedpeoples working in essential in-person jobs, that are typically underpaid and over-exposed toCOVID-19.160 Furthermore, without a home there is no ability to socially distance or quarantinewhen exposed to COVID-19. An important factor of this is mask quality. Many essential workersare unable to access high-quality masks, such as KN95 masks. Inaccessibility to quality masks is160 Kantamneni, 2020.159 Sontag, 26.Young 86critical in COVID-19 risk as many essential workers cannot avoid exposure to unmaskedindividuals.Queer homeless youth who are living in shelters or transitional housing may be sharing aroom or bathroom with multiple individuals. The economic impacts of the pandemic havedecreased available resources and funding for shelters and other supports for people experiencinghomelessness which has impacted the number of beds available. An additional impact of thepandemic on queer homeless youth is that those who were “couch surfing” and spending a fewdays at a time with multiple friends, family members, or strangers, can no longer safely do so ormay be unwelcomed. The inability to stay with multiple hosts put many queer homeless youthsonto the streets where there is almost no protection from COVID-19. Housing instability duringthe COVID-19 pandemic is also impacted by the queer control complex. Shelters that policeyouth by monitoring relationships, and enforcing curfews, dress-codes, and abstinence onlypolicies to drug use displace youth are unable to comply. These shelter policies are all the moredangerous as drug use and mental health struggles are on the rise due to the isolation andanxieties surrounding the pandemic. Queer homeless youth who are vulnerable to increased druguse and who engage in “deviant behaviors” become susceptible to COVID-19 and HIV infectiononce back on the streets. The instability that is defined by the queer control complex helpsexplicate how deviant behavior and moralized conceptions of disease harm queer homelessyouth.Masking and vaccinations are another important aspect of individually avoidingCOVID-19 infection. When people go unmasked and infections increase, a sentiment of “theygot what was coming for them” arises. The same language applied to queer homeless youth whocontracted HIV is used to define queer homeless youth who contract COVID-19. Just as queerYoung 87homeless youth are thought to deserve HIV infection due to engagement in queer sex, survivalsex, and IV drug usage; queer homeless youth may be thought to deserve HIV infection due tonot keeping social distancing and remaining unmasked and/or unvaccinated. A national dialoguehas appeared demonizing the infected for not behaving correctly and for the “good of others.”This form of moralization, seen during the HIV/AIDS pandemic, takes the responsibility ofillness from the state and global health entities, and places it onto the individual. It is theobligation of the US citizen to protect their community rather than the obligation of thecommunity and state to protect the citizen.At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic the political left in the United States werepublicly critical of people who did not follow public health guidance, such as having in-personchurch services and relaxed social-distancing guidelines. Having left-wing, socially liberalindividuals engage in this behavior is an interesting shift in who is perpetuating diseasemoralization dialogue as it was typically right-wing, socially conservative individuals during theemergence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It is irrevocably dangerous to moralize disease; theallowance for individual blame shifts responsibility for disease control and adequate publichealth response from governing bodies to “risky” people. The same discourse that paintedHIV/AIDS as a disease of licentious queer people, is framing COVID-19 as a disease of theuncaring and lazy American. In both instances, queer homeless youth are disproportionatelyinfected and impacted due to existing syndemics. Due to the moralizations of HIV andCOVID-19, aid is impacted by social stigma and a perception of deservedness.Young 88Chapter 5ConclusionBetween 1980-2020 queer homeless youth in the United States have faced two majorsyndemics during the HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 crises. The co-occurrence of homelessness,drug and alcohol abuse, mental health struggles, tobacco use, HIV and COVID-19 infection havedisproportionately and negatively impacted the health of queer homeless youth populations in theUnited States. Syndemic theory illustrates the synergistic relationship between these factors andhelps illustrate the disproportionately negative impacts the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics havehad on queer homeless youth. Furthermore, the moralization of disease has led to a generalperception of queer homeless youth deserving their disease diagnosis and the symptoms,suffering, and death that accompany.Though the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet come to a close, those in contemporarypublic health are bracing for when, not if, the next pandemic will hit. As this thesis demonstrates,there has been an abject lack of care or supports existing for queer homeless youth for decades.To survive, many queer youths have engaged in survival behaviors, such as survival sex andbreaking quarantine social-distancing mandates, which have put them at a higher risk ofcontracting HIV and COVID-19. Their “risky” behaviors are moralized due to existing tabooswhich allows for the social construction of “deservedness” of their disease.The existing literature concurs that queer homeless youth are disproportionately impactedby the syndemic of COVID-19, HIV, drug and alcohol addiction, and mental illness struggles, ina continual process of systematic failures. The systems of oppression (like homophobia, racism,and classism) further the syndemic impacts that queer homeless youth face, creating conditionsYoung 89of vulnerability and leading to higher susceptibility of HIV and COVID-19; here, the etiology ofHIV and COVID infection is heavily correlated with the social determinants of health thatimpact care accessibility.How may queer homeless youth be adequately and comprehensively cared for? To lookforward we must look back. In 1990 the United States Department of Health and HumanServices stated that queer street youth needed an allocation of funds for local planning,collaboration between local service providers, a coordinating agency within communities, andlong-term shelters to help tackle HIV infection rates.161 Devastatingly, three decades later notmuch has improved. A sustained effort to stabilize housing for queer youth is imperative.Programs specifically addressing drug and alcohol addiction and mental illness that allow forgender nonconformity and queer expression are critical.162 Community awareness of the causesof homelessness are needed and public investment for long-term HIV treatment plans will befundamental in the longevity of maintaining queer youths’ health.163 Most importantly, alarge-scale effort is needed to support youth so that they do not become homeless in the firstplace. It is paramount to recognize that homophobia, racism, classism, ableism, and othersystems of oppression have worked as causal factors to force queer youth onto the streets. It isknown that the intersectional nature of queer experiences with homelessness, infection, andpoverty render queer folks vulnerable to poor health outcomes. As such, any outreach effort thatdoes not seek to address this will fail. Furthermore, there is a demonstrated need tocomprehensively research the interactions between syndemic within the framework of queerculture. Understandings of how and why queer youth engage in certain behavior patterns mayhelp to establish best outreach practices and sustain better health outcomes.163 Ecker, 2016162 Brandon, 2020161 Chaffee, 18Young 90This thesis initially began as a history centered project documenting narratives of queeryouth homelessness in the 1980s and 1990s. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved it becameclear to me that the moralization of diseases profoundly impacts day to day life and exacerbatesan already inaccessible healthcare system. Offering a new comparative analysis of HIV andCOVID-19 recontextualizes the synergistic relationship between disease, illness, and suffering todescribe the unique challenges queer homeless youth face. All people are deserving of shelter,food, water, healthcare, and community. To truly empower and celebrate queer youth we mustensure that they have safe access to all of these basic necessities (and more).  Looking forward, Iask you to reimagine the future, to speculate on a world that recognizes that with sharedresources we can house and feed all people. This does not begin with just policy change, or freeHIV testing, or even an increased capacity in shelters. Day to day we must recognize theviolences and barriers queer youth face on the micro scale to adequately address the macro. Toparaphrase Anita Hill, it is essential that we stop the everyday harms to prevent the spectacularand egregious. For over four decades queer homeless youth have been subject to sensationalharms; change is overdue.Young 91AcknowledgmentsThank you to my dear Pitzer community who consistently encouraged me to pursuelearning for the joy of learning.

    "abstract": "The treatment and survival of a society\\u27s marginalized peoples reveal the true impacts of a pandemic. An analysis of homeless queer youth during the HIV/AIDS and SARS-CoV-2 crises lays bare the systemic failure of the United States government to provide equitable healthcare.\nI compare the HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 pandemics in queer homeless youth to demonstrate the dangers of disease moralization via a sociocultural analyses of disease stigma and responsibility politics. Utilizing syndemic theory I draw on the synergistic relationship between disease and illness to describe the unique challenges queer homeless youth face. A syndemic framework is applied to address common comorbidities that exist in queer homeless youth populations, with a focus on socio-cultural phenomena that rendered queer youth susceptible and vulnerable to homeless, HIV/AIDS, COVID-19, drug and alcohol abuse, mental health struggles, and tobacco use. Understanding how and why queer homeless youth become ill lays the foundation for how disease moralization impacts resource and healthcare accessibility. The social construction of HIV/AIDS aided in the creation of the  at-risk identity  whereby all queer peoples are understood to be at risk for HIV, and thus queerness itself becomes a risk factor. The at-risk identity and the moralization of HIV creates a sense of  deservedness;  i.e. queer people deserve their diagnosis, suffering and death due to their engagement in risky behavior. Key risk behaviors include anal and vaginal sex and intravenous drug usage. Understandings of consent and survival further frame how queer homeless youth are impacted. The at-risk identity and conception of deservedness may be compared to COVID-19. Queer homeless youth engage in many COVID-19  risky  behaviors, such as not socially distancing, which leads to a social conception of deserving their illness and the suffering that comes with it. These existing crises have amplified the impact of an unjust healthcare system",
