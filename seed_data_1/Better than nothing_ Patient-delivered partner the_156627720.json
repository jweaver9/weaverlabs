Patient-delivered partnertherapy and partner notification for chlamydia:the views of Australian general practitionersNatasha L Pavlin1*, Rhian M Parker2, Anna K Piggin2, Carol A Hopkins3,4, Meredith J Temple-Smith1,Christopher K Fairley3,4, Jane E Tomnay5, Francis J Bowden6, Darren B Russell7, Jane S Hocking8, Marian K Pitts9,Marcus Y Chen3,4AbstractBackground: Genital chlamydia is the most commonly notified sexually transmissible infection (STI) in Australiaand worldwide and can have serious reproductive health outcomes. Partner notification, testing and treatment areimportant facets of chlamydia control. Traditional methods of partner notification are not reaching enoughpartners to effectively control transmission of chlamydia. Patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) has been shownto improve the treatment of sexual partners. In Australia, General Practitioners (GPs) are responsible for the bulk ofchlamydia testing, diagnosis, treatment and follow up. This study aimed to determine the views and practices ofAustralian general practitioners (GPs) in relation to partner notification and PDPT for chlamydia and explored GPs’perceptions of their patients’ barriers to notifying partners of a chlamydia diagnosis.Methods: In-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 40 general practitioners (GPs) fromrural, regional and urban Australia from November 2006 to March 2007. Topics covered: GPs’ current practice andviews about partner notification, perceived barriers and useful supports, previous use of and views regarding PDPT.Transcripts were imported into NVivo7 and subjected to thematic analysis. Data saturation was reached after 32interviews had been completed.Results: Perceived barriers to patients telling partners (patient referral) included: stigma; age and culturalbackground; casual or long-term relationship, ongoing relationship or not. Barriers to GPs undertaking partnernotification (provider referral) included: lack of time and staff; lack of contact details; uncertainty about the legalityof contacting partners and whether this constitutes breach of patient confidentiality; and feeling both personallyuncomfortable and inadequately trained to contact someone who is not their patient. GPs were divided on theuse of PDPT - many felt concerned that it is not best clinical practice but many also felt that it is better thannothing.GPs identified the following factors which they considered would facilitate partner notification: clear clinical guide-lines; a legal framework around partner notification; a formal chlamydia screening program; financial incentives;education and practical support for health professionals, and raising awareness of chlamydia in the community, inparticular amongst young people.Conclusions: GPs reported some partners do not seek medical treatment even after they are notified of being asexual contact of a patient with chlamydia. More routine use of PDPT may help address this issue however GPs inthis study had negative attitudes to the use of PDPT. Appropriate guidelines and legislation may make the use ofPDPT more acceptable to Australian GPs.* Correspondence: npavlin@ozisp.com.au1Department of General Practice, The University of Melbourne, 200 BerkleyStreet, Carlton, Victoria, AustraliaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlePavlin et al.

Chlamydial infections can have ser-ious reproductive health outcomes, particularly forwomen, and can result in tubal infertility, and ectopicpregnancy [2]. General practitioners (GPs) in Australiaare ideally placed to conduct widespread chlamydiascreening as nearly 90% of Australian women aged 15-24 years of age, the key risk group [2] visit a GP at leastonce each year [3]. As such GPs have been the focus forAustralia’s chlamydia screening efforts and are the pro-viders most likely to be treating chlamydia. Australia’streatment guidelines for chlamydia include antibiotictreatment for the index case and their known partnersand a repeat test for re-infection 3 months after treat-ment [4].A cornerstone in the management of treatable STIs isthe testing and treatment of sexual partners [5]. Effec-tive partner management potentially prevents infectionand its sequelae in partners and reduces the risk of re-infection in the index case.There is concern that traditional methods of partnernotification, such as patient or provider referral, are notreaching enough partners to effectively control thetransmission of chlamydia [6-8]. Patient referral involvesthe person diagnosed with the STI contacting their part-ners themselves. Provider referral has traditionallymeant public health staff, who are trained in partnernotification, contacting partners on behalf of the patient.In recent years provider referral has also been used todescribe health care providers - both medical and nur-sing - performing this function. Minimal evidence existsof the efficacy of this type of provider referral. There islimited availability of trained public health staff to per-form partner notification in Australia and in practiceonly patients themselves and in some cases their doctorsor nurses are active in partner notification for chlamy-dia. Various approaches have been tried around theworld to improve notification and treatment of sexualpartners. These include point of care counselling, inter-net and SMS based partner notification and patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) [5-7]. This involvesthe patient delivering antibiotics (e.g. single-dose azi-thromycin) to their sexual partner/s, without the partnerattending a consultation with a health professional. Stu-dies have shown PDPT to be as effective as, and insome cases more effective, than patient referral in boththe proportion of sexual partners treated, and in redu-cing re-infection rates in index women [9-15]. PDPT iscurrently used in Sweden and parts of the USA [8,15],and has been recommended as an option for themanagement of chlamydia in draft guidance from the U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence[15]. PDPT provides flexibility for treatment of partnerswho are unwilling or unable to attend a consultationwith a health professional [6]. However, PDPT is a con-troversial practice as it involves a health professionalproviding medication for an individual that they havenot met, nor clinically evaluated [15].In Australia, research suggests GPs want guidance andsupport for partner notification and there is currentlyno specific legislation or guidelines supporting the useof PDPT [16]. Aside from legal considerations, clinicianscontemplating PDPT also face potential medico-legaland ethical issues stemming from the treatment of indi-viduals who are not “their” patients. Few published dataexist on clinicians’ use of and views on PDPT fromcountries where it is not specifically supported nor seenas normal clinical practice. This study aimed to deter-mine the views and practices of Australian general prac-titioners (GPs) on partner notification, particularly inrelation to PDPT and explored GPs’ perceptions of theirpatients’ barriers to notifying partners of a chlamydiadiagnosis.MethodsEthics approval was obtained from University of Mel-bourne Human Research Ethics Committee. All partici-pants gave informed consent. In-depth, semi-structuredtelephone interviews were conducted with 40 GPs fromNovember 2006 to March 2007.GPs from Queensland, Victoria and the ACT (n =9826 ) were initially identified by postcode from theAMPCo database [17]. GPs from Queensland and Vic-toria were then divided into rural and urban areas. Astatistician randomised each group. GPs known to workin Indigenous Health were also approached via tele-phone listings in the White Pages Telephone Directory.GPs with experience in working with Indigenous Aus-tralians were oversampled to ensure their views wererepresented in the study.To be eligible to participate GPs must have diagnosedat least one case of chlamydia in the past year.Each week 15 rural and 15 urban GPs from Victoriaand Queensland and 7 from the Australian Capital Ter-ritory (ACT) were contacted by mail or fax and fol-lowed up with a phone call until 40 GPs had beeninterviewed. Over an 11 week period there were 7 mailouts; 59 letters sent to rural Victoria; 59 to urban Vic-toria; 65 to rural Queensland; 60 to urban Queenslandand 43 letters sent to GPs in the ACT. Forty letterswere sent to GPs currently working in Indigenoushealth in rural Victoria, urban Victoria and ruralQueensland.Pavlin et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:274http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/274Page 2 of 7Topics covered in the interviews included GPs’ cur-rent practice and views about partner notification, bar-riers they experience and supports they need to moreeffectively implement the partner notification processfor patients with chlamydia. Specific questions wereasked about previous use of and views regarding PDPT.The interview schedule was piloted with two GPs andamended following review by authors RP and NP. NPconducted all interviews; she is a practicing GP and wasable to relate to the participants’ concerns and environ-ment, and to probe their responses appropriately. NPwas supervised by RP who has extensive experience con-ducting interviews on sensitive topics and acknowledgedskills in qualitative research. RP regularly listened tointerview recordings and provided feedback to NP.Interviews took 30-40 minutes, were audio-taped,transcribed, imported into NVivo7 as a Word documentand subjected to thematic analysis. [18]. To avoid bias,both NP and RP read all transcripts and developed acoding framework. Emerging themes were reviewed asthe analysis progressed, and made use of the differentperspectives of NP (GP researcher) and RP (sociologist).Data saturation was reached when no new themesemerged after the initial 32 interviews were analysed,although a further 8 were completed and analysed.ResultsThe 40 GPs interviewed work predominately in privategeneral practice although as mentioned previously doc-tors working in Aboriginal Medical Services were delib-erately oversampled. Table 1 describes thedemographics of the GPs interviewed for this study.Communication difficulties (in terms of English lan-guage skills) were evident in five interviews. Twenty-three interviewees worked full-time in General Practice(defined as >30 hours per week) and 17 worked part-time ( < 30 hours per week). Twenty-five GPs reportedno experience with Indigenous patients, five reportedsome experience with Indigenous patients and ten hadvery significant experience with Indigenous patients. Alldenied having a particular interest in sexual health.Current methods of partner notificationVarious methods of partner notification were used bythe GPs. A majority viewed partner notification as thepatient’s responsibility (patient referral), a finding con-sistent with other Australian studies [16,19,20]. Providerreferral was undertaken by a small number of GPs.Many GPs expressed confusion about the ‘correct’ pro-tocol for partner notification, and uncertainty about theroles and responsibilities of themselves, their patientsand the public health authorities....is it the GP’s role to contact all their partners, or is it theDHS [Department of Human Services], or who? (Dr RE 185)Barriers to partner notification and treatmentPerceived barriers to patients telling partners included:the stigma of having an STI; patient factors such as ageand cultural background; and relationship factors suchas whether it is a casual or long-term relationship, andwhether the relationship is ongoing or has ended....in terms of getting people to make sure that otherrelationships are notified... I think the conflict there isthat for young people sometimes it’s very traumatic to -to disconnect from an intense and intimate relationship.And having completed the disconnection, I don’t thinkthey actually want to revisit it on any level. (Dr DC 246)And so... they might’ve had a number of boyfriendsover a reasonably short period of time. And you sort oftry to say, well, it could be any of those guys, so maybeyou should actually inform them all. But that’s verythreatening... and I’m sure they don’t do it.

BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:274http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/274Page 3 of 7Barriers to the GPs themselves undertaking partnernotification (provider referral) included: lack of time andstaff to undertake the work; logistical difficulties such aslack of contact details; uncertainty about the legality ofcontacting partners and whether this constitutes breachof patient confidentiality; and feeling both personallyuncomfortable and inadequately trained to contactsomeone who is not their patient.Well, resource number one, time. Number two, whichstaff member would do it, so you’d have to allocate aperson to it, and that is all work for free. (Dr DL ATSI348)I think it’s, you know, hard to be on the end of thephone and going, “Hello, you don’t know me from a barof soap but I think we need to test you for chlamydia”.You know that conversation is always going to be a hardone and I think that is a big barrier. (Dr GY 371)Many GPs felt that a particular barrier to effectivetreatment of partners is that, even once notification hasoccurred, many partners are unwilling or unable toattend a consultation with a health professional.I guess the main barrier we would see is that peoplewon’t come in. We do have an urgent recall as I say formore than six months, twelve months and they justwon’t come in, so whether they’ve got a suspicion of whatit is, or they just haven’t sort of formed a rapport withthe practice, um, that’d be our main thing... (Dr ECATSI 306)Probably the other thing is gender related becausemales are reluctant to come to the doctors in general,and the partners - the patients who are screening aremostly females, and males don’t come to the doctor, soprobably that’s a barrier, the gender itself. (Dr EP 241)The - you know, the amount of trouble you have to goto contact some people is - is astounding. And even whenyou get on to them and tell them that they have to come,they still don’t come. (Dr KN 512)Facilitators for better partner notification and treatmentGPs identified the following factors which they consid-ered would facilitate partner notification: clear clinicalguidelines; a legal framework around partner notifica-tion; a formal chlamydia screening program; financialincentives; education and practical support for healthprofessionals, and raising awareness of chlamydia in thecommunity, in particular amongst young people.I think it would be...more a clear system change. So,some sort of... clear guidelines for a GP to follow, and,you know, with the - the legal or government backupthat we’re sort of obliged to do this thing. And, youknow, therefore involve the patient and everything in away that’s a bit less ambiguous than it is now. (Dr EAATSI 721)I mean the public awareness of it - if there was anational campaign which would run, would obviously bea lot better. So that might be...helpful I guess in somerespects. But the awareness of it would be increased, sothat... perhaps people would then have a better baselineknowledge in terms of...contact tracing...and the impor-tance of it, and ah, it’s necessary - necessary nature of it.(Dr TM 447)Views on PDPTSlightly fewer than half of the GPs expressed positiveviews about PDPT and slightly more than half expressednegative views about PDPT. Of those who expressednegative views it appeared that a small minority feltstrongly against PDPT and the remainder had moremoderate concerns. A small number of the interviewedGPs did not have any particular views on PDPT.Positive attitudes to PDPTThose with positive attitudes towards PDPT mostlyexpressed the viewpoint that while the ideal situationwould be to clinically evaluate the partner, PDPT is pre-ferable to no treatment at all. They considered that thebenefits outweighed the risks.... it’s probably best to see them anyway... I mean, forcounselling. But if you suspect that they will never comeback, it’s probably a better result for population healthrather than not give anything. (Dr EP 190)But if you’ve got a situation where that’s your onlyoption for treatment them, then ah, it’s better than noth-ing, I would say. [In] the scheme of things the ideal carewould be to have them come in, and talk to them aboutall their sexual stuff, and make sure there are no otherthings that you need to treat or deal with. But if you’vegot a partner who’s just not going to come in, and theonly way you’re going to get them treated is if the girl-friend takes - takes them home and gives them [the med-ication] - I mean, you know. It’s probably better than nottreating them at all. (DR HR ATSI 330)Some GPs considered PDPT, including the fact thatthey were not actually testing the partner for chlamydia,to be acceptable as usual practice would be to treatsuch patients empirically due to known exposure to acase.In this scenario it’s easier because we know that he hasto be treated, so - and we know that - and you wouldtreat him anyway. We wouldn’t do swabs. We wouldtreat him anyway because he’s - he’s a possible contact.So I think it’s all right to give a script without seeingsomeone if - if that’s - would be the end result anyway.(Dr EP 183)Several GPs considered that PDPT had evidence-basedbenefits.Pavlin et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:274http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/274Page 4 of 7I’ve actually - um, about a year ago I looked up sort ofone of these evidence-based, ah, web pages and I sawthat there is some evidence to say that that is a goodidea, and we would commonly do it. (Dr EC ATSI 277)Negative attitudes to PDPTClinical, medicolegal and ethical concerns regarding theuse of PDPT were expressed by some GPs.Clinical concernsThe most commonly expressed concern was that PDPTdid not represent best clinical practice. Specific concernsincluded: the lack of opportunity to undertake a com-plete history and clinical examination, in particular toassess for contraindications to medication such as aller-gies or drug-drug interactions; lack of diagnostic testingbefore, and follow-up testing after treatment; lack ofinvestigation for complications of chlamydial infectionor concurrent STIs; missed opportunity for informationsharing between the health professional and the partner;and lack of further tracing of the partner’s other sexualcontacts.Well, I don’t think that would be looked at as a rea-sonable option by the College [Royal Australian Collegeof General Practitioners] or standards or peers. (Dr EG288)There are medical issues with that - can you be sure ofwhat their allergies are? Can you be sure that they arenot pregnant or not taking some sort of other medicationthat will interfere with the normal treatment? Definitelyit deprives them of a follow up, in that most people - allpeople with chlamydia should be tested two weeks laterto confirm clearance of the infection. That isn’t going tohappen if you prescribe by proxy. The other last thingthat is of significance is that if somebody has chlamydiathat greatly enhances their risk of acquiring anothersexually transmitted disease at the same time. Treatingthe chlamydia alone is arguably inadequate treatmentfor the other partner. (Dr BK 192)Many GPs were concerned that PDPT might not beeffective. A particular concern was whether the doctorcould be sure that the partner has been notified andgiven the script, and whether the script is filled and themedication goes to the person it was intended for.Medicolegal and ethical concernsSome GPs had specific concerns about the medicolegalimplications of PDPT.And can you imagine standing in the Coroner’s Courtsaying, “Yeah, well, I hadn’t even seen them, hadn’t evenmet them before, and um, you know, I wrote a script forthem, or wrote a script for my patient knowing full wellthat they were going to give it to somebody else.” I mean,it’s - it’s illegal. (Dr MS 227)Others were concerned that patients may use themedication to treat their partners without the partner’sfull understanding, and that this would not meet theethical and legal requirement of informed consent fortreatment.I think the medico-legal issue there is probably the big-gest one. If they’re on some kind of concurrent medica-tion or have an allergy - they need to know why they’retaking it. I could foresee a scenario where it gets slippedinto their, um, Vegemite toast in the morning...(Dr TM365)And I think it’s probably important to make sure thatthe information they’re getting is the correct information,‘cause the partner may [say], you know, “I just need youto take this ‘cause I’ve got thrush and we need to treatthe thrush,” and they go, “Oh yeah, okay, that’s fine.” (DrGY 344)DiscussionThis is one of the first qualitative studies to investigateAustralian GPs’ attitudes towards PDPT as an approachto treating partners of patients with chlamydia. Bothpositive and negative views were expressed by GPs. Abarrier to effective management of partners as identifiedby many of the GPs is that some partners are unwillingor unable to seek timely medical treatment even afterthey are notified of being a sexual contact of a patientwith chlamydia. This finding is significant, as it identifiesa need that could be met by the use of PDPT, whichprovides a flexible alternative for treatment of partnerswho may otherwise be left untreated. Guidelines andlegislation are required in Australia to support GPs inusing PDPT where appropriate.Through the interviews with the GPs, it became clearthat there is no uniform approach to partner notificationfor chlamydia in Australia, a finding reported elsewhere[16,19]. While patient referral was the most commonlyreported method used, provider referral was used by asmaller number of GPs. GPs felt they would be betterable to facilitate partner notification if they receivedclarification about best practice, and about the roles andresponsibilities of patients, GPs and the public healthauthorities. Education, tools and practical support forGPs were also identified as possible facilitators for part-ner notification in this study, and in other recent Aus-tralian studies [20,21]. Online services that allowpatients to email or text message partners have alsoshown promise and could assist both GPs and patientswith partner notification [6,21].GPs in this study expressed negative views aboutPDPT. This is in contrast to similar surveys conductedin the U.K. and the U.S., in which a majority of doctorsinterviewed expressed positive views about PDPT, and/or a willingness to use it [6,8,22]. This difference mayPavlin et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:274http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/274Page 5 of 7be related to the nature of the doctors included in thesamples - in many of the overseas studies, the doctorssampled included gynaecologists, genitourinary physi-cians, or doctors with a particular interest in familyplanning and sexual health. In addition, PDPT is legal insome jurisdictions within the U.S. [23], and its use isencouraged, so doctors there are likely to be more com-fortable about using PDPT.Another important factor, which may explain this dif-ference, is the context in which the use of PDPT is pro-posed. The concern most commonly expressed aboutPDPT by GPs in this study was that PDPT did notrepresent best practice. The GPs were clearly concernedabout providing medication for someone whom theyhad never met, let alone clinically evaluated with a thor-ough history and examination. This is understandable asPDPT does represent a significant departure from thetraditional doctor-patient relationship, particularly in asetting such as Australia with a tradition of strict regula-tion of prescribed medications. However, PDPT as it isused overseas is not intended to replace best practice,but to be available as an option to treat partners whowould otherwise not be treated at all. For example, Cali-fornian guidelines for the use of PDPT state that its useshould be restricted to “those with partners who areunable or unlikely to seek timely clinical services“ [24].Similarly, in this study, those GPs who supported PDPTrecognised that it was not best practice, but that itcould be a useful compromise in situations where thealternative would be no treatment at all.In addition to clarification about the situations inwhich PDPT is appropriate, other practical concernsexpressed by the GPs in this study would also need tobe addressed before it is seen as a legitimate treatmentoption. Many GPs felt that PDPT may not be safe, parti-cularly because the patient would not be assessed forthe possibility of allergic reactions to the medication.However, azithromycin, the drug usually prescribed inPDPT, is generally a well-tolerated and safe antibiotic,with a low incidence of allergic reactions [15]. Althougha number of GPs considered that PDPT may not bevery effective, some studies have found that it is equallyor more effective than patient referral partner notifica-tion [9-15], the method currently employed by themajority of GPs in Australia.GPs were concerned that PDPT may result in incom-plete care for the partner, since they are not evaluatedfor complications of infection (such as pelvic inflamma-tory disease in women), or for concurrent STIs. Whilethe likelihood of such complications and concurrentinfections depends on the population of interest, arecent Australian study has concluded that the incidenceof these complications and concurrent infections in het-erosexual partners is low enough to recommend the useof PDPT [25]. Further studies should be done to con-firm these findings, and to help clarify the populationsin which PDPT could be safely used.Another concern was the lack of opportunity to tracethe partner’s additional sexual contacts. A recent auditconducted in Scotland found that the use of PDPTmeant that 22-28% fewer additional cases of chlamydiawere found than when partners were clinically evaluatedand secondary sexual contacts traced [26].It should be noted that if the alternative to PDPT isnot informing of partners at all, this also prevents eva-luation of the sexual partner for complications and con-current infections, and secondary contact tracing.Therefore, some may consider that it is preferable touse PDPT in these settings, as at least it has the benefitof empirically treating the chlamydial infection of thesexual partner.A strength of this study is the inclusion of GPs acrossa broad range of backgrounds and locations across Aus-tralia. As this was a preliminary study, and the inter-views had a broad scope, some issues identified wouldbenefit from further in-depth study. Future research onthe attitudes of GPs towards PDPT, with more probingquestions and scenario-based discussion, would allowfor deeper understanding of this complex issue. In addi-tion, an important area for further research would bethe views of patients themselves on the use of PDPT [6].ConclusionsThis small qualitative study of Australian GPs foundthat at present more GPs have negative rather thanpositive views about PDPT for the treatment of sexualpartners of patients with chlamydia. Many of the con-cerns expressed by the GPs are likely to be amelioratedby the provision of further information about the appro-priate use of PDPT and its safety and effectiveness. Ulti-mately, guidelines, decision support tools and legislativechanges that specifically support PDPT are needed,before practitioners feel comfortable with the use ofPDPT.AcknowledgementsThe Australian Federal Government Department of Health and AgeingChlamydia Pilot Program of Targeted Grants funded the study.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Genital chlamydia is the most commonly notified sexually transmissible infection (STI) in Australia and worldwide and can have serious reproductive health outcomes. Partner notification, testing and treatment are important facets of chlamydia control. Traditional methods of partner notification are not reaching enough partners to effectively control transmission of chlamydia. Patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) has been shown to improve the treatment of sexual partners. In Australia, General Practitioners (GPs) are responsible for the bulk of chlamydia testing, diagnosis, treatment and follow up. This study aimed to determine the views and practices of Australian general practitioners (GPs) in relation to partner notification and PDPT for chlamydia and explored GPs' perceptions of their patients' barriers to notifying partners of a chlamydia diagnosis. METHODS In-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 40 general practitioners (GPs) from rural, regional and urban Australia from November 2006 to March 2007. Topics covered: GPs' current practice and views about partner notification, perceived barriers and useful supports, previous use of and views regarding PDPT.Transcripts were imported into NVivo7 and subjected to thematic analysis. Data saturation was reached after 32 interviews had been completed. RESULTS Perceived barriers to patients telling partners (patient referral) included: stigma; age and cultural background; casual or long-term relationship, ongoing relationship or not. Barriers to GPs undertaking partner notification (provider referral) included: lack of time and staff; lack of contact details; uncertainty about the legality of contacting partners and whether this constitutes breach of patient confidentiality; and feeling both personally uncomfortable and inadequately trained to contact someone who is not their patient. GPs were divided on the use of PDPT--many felt concerned that it is not best clinical practice but many also felt that it is better than nothing.GPs identified the following factors which they considered would facilitate partner notification: clear clinical guidelines; a legal framework around partner notification; a formal chlamydia screening program; financial incentives; education and practical support for health professionals, and raising awareness of chlamydia in the community, in particular amongst young people. CONCLUSIONS GPs reported some partners do not seek medical treatment even after they are notified of being a sexual contact of a patient with chlamydia. More routine use of PDPT may help address this issue however GPs in this study had negative attitudes to the use of PDPT. Appropriate guidelines and legislation may make the use of PDPT more acceptable to Australian GPs.The Australian Federal Government Department of Health and Ageing Chlamydia Pilot Program of Targeted Grants funded the study",
