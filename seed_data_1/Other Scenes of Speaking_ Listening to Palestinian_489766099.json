PQBDS argued that Israel was using gay rightsand gay lives to pinkwash state-sanctioned violence against Palestinians. Sincethen, much has been said and written about Israel’s pinkwashing campaignand the violence it endorses and engenders. But much remains unsaid aboutPalestinian anticolonial-queer modes of engagement that persist despite Israel’ssettler-colonial project. With specific attention to the 2012 Jadaliyya debatebetween Jasbir Puar and Maya Mikdashi, on the one hand, and Haneen Maikeyand Heike Schotten, on the other, this article discusses various activist andscholarly responses to Israel’s pinkwashing campaign, and particularly howthese responses elide Palestinian anticolonial-queer activism in differentways. Ultimately, this article asks: What becomes (in)audible as a Palestiniananticolonial-queer critique?The present itself is but a moment of vision—vision of the freedom not yet come.—Achille Mbembe, “Necropolitics”PALESTINIAN QUEERS FOR BDS launched their first public call for solidarity with the Palestinianpeople in 2010. The call highlighted Israel’s utilization of gay rights and gay lives to pinkwashstate-sanctioned violence against Palestinians.1 It asked queer communities around the globe tosupport the 2005 Palestinian Civil Society Call for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions),which urges Israel to (1) end its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantle theWall, (2) recognize the fundamental right of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality,and (3) respect, protect, and promote the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homesand properties as stipulated by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194.2Originally founded by a handful of queer Palestinians in occupied Palestine, the group, nowknown as Pinkwatching Israel, has over the years widened its focus from anti-pinkwashingactivities to a broader anticolonial-queer critique that uncovers the role of Zionist sexual politicsin Israel’s settler-colonial project.3 The underlying premise of the shift was that queer activistsshould be responsive to the larger context of Zionist settler colonialism, thereby upholding BDS,Journal of Palestine Studies Vol. XLVII, No. 3 (Spring 2018), p. 45, ISSN: 0377-919X; electronic ISSN: 1533-8614. © 2018 by the Institute for PalestineStudies.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1525/jps.2018.47.3.45.Spring 2018 || 45Other Scenes of Speaking: Listening toPalestinian Anticolonial-Queer Critiqueand not reduce solidarity with Palestine simply to solidarity with queers in Palestine. In the wordsof Angela Davis, Palestinian Queers for BDS (PQBDS) “broadens the terrain of struggle againstthe occupation and against the Zionist policies of Israel.”4 By demanding that they engage theparameters of struggle formulated by the civil society movement for Palestinian liberation, theorganization holds accountable both international activists and scholars. In parallel, it urgesPalestinian and Palestine solidarity activists to deeply engage with the sexual and gendered politicsof Zionist settler colonialism.5A central question emerging from the PQBDS call is, How should one respond to it? And,additionally, how are responses to the question shaped by the larger political context, whichnarrows both the understanding of injustice as well as its alleviation? There are no quick answersor easy resolutions to such questions. In line with the epigraph to this article, what decolonizingvisions of freedom not yet come do our responses enable and/or preclude? Achille Mbembeanalyzes the figure of the (Palestinian) suicide bomber who finds freedom only in death as aninstance of the temporal “space where freedom and negation operate” and where “the future . . .can be authentically anticipated but not in the present.”6 While I take seriously the violentlyrestrictive conditions operating in the settler-colonial context,7 this article foregrounds visions ofthe future not yet come: in other words, visions anticipated in the present that remain denied. Inother words, PQBDS’s call for supporting BDS and Palestinian liberation demonstrates thatvisions of a different future for Palestine already exist, and that even though they are renderedimpossible in the present they persist under conditions of settler-colonial dispossession and death.8Much has been said and written about Israel’s pinkwashing campaign and the violence itendorses and engenders.9 But relatively little has been said about Palestinian anticolonial-queermodes of engagement that endure under Israeli settler colonialism, or about the ways in whichscholarly and activist responses to Israel’s pinkwashing campaign fail to engage Palestiniananticolonial-queer critique.10 In exploring the various responses to the PQBDS call, my centralquestions are, What becomes audible as a Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique? What does thiscritique demand of the listener? And, what other scenes of speaking become audible by engagingwith Palestinian anticolonial-queer activism?The theatrical metaphor of the scene highlights the issue of contexts—those that allow certainvoices to become intelligible and audible and others in which certain voices remain unheard. Suchscenes are also performative: they construct a particular hegemonic terrain of struggle, withprotagonists and antagonists, scripts, and audiences. Briefly, they constitute the debates that shapethe responses to the ongoing Palestinian catastrophe, and by highlighting how such debates relateto queer politics and Palestine, this article focuses on the ways in which they enable and/or inhibitactivism, as well as the conditions for its occurrence. I call them scenes of speaking as thismetaphor more closely addresses the constructed and therefore also alterable character of suchdebates and it engages the question of the listener. The scenes-of-speaking metaphor allows me toexplore how the terrain of struggle is constructed and, in turn, how these constructions depend onparticular preexisting forms of engagement. Tending to Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique asanother scene of speaking demands acts of listening and responsiveness beyond the bounds ofconventional scripts, and I foreground other visions of a future not yet come, which becomeaudible by engaging these critiques.Other Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer Critique46 || Journal of Palestine StudiesGayatri Chakravorty Spivak tackles the question of the listener in her work on the subaltern. Thesubaltern, Spivak explains, demands an engagement with issues of representation and subjectivity.Rather than being about the voice of the subaltern—a prevailing misreading of her work—Spivak’sprovocative question “Can the subaltern speak?” is a demand placed on the listener. According toSpivak, one cannot claim to speak from a subaltern position. This does not mean that the subalterndoes not speak (another misreading), but rather that “we” (those of us with access to lines of socialmobility) refuse to listen.11 In an interview that appears in The Post-Colonial Critic, she states: “Forme, the question ‘who should speak?’ is less crucial than ‘who will listen?’ ‘I will speak for myself asa Third World person’ is an important position for political mobilization today. But the realdemand is that, when I speak from that position, I should be listened to seriously; not with thatkind of benevolent imperialism, really, which simply says that because I happen to be an Indian orwhatever.”12Although Palestinian queer activists have gained access to certain forms of social mobility due tothe popularization of anti-pinkwashing activism in the Global North, whether “we” outside Palestine(will) listen, and who that “we” is, remain unanswered questions. Activist calls for justice continue toencounter different forms of intransigence, and the responses they receive fail to alter existingstructures of power, even when allied groups express support. The case of Palestine complicatesSpivak’s question of the subaltern: despite access to certain forms of social mobility for somePalestinian queer activists, the audibility of Palestinian anticolonial-queer activist critique remainslargely foreclosed and/or elided.This article unpacks those different forms of intransigence and also asks what other ways ofresponding and listening become possible if we consider the conditions of speaking created bythe Palestinian queer movement. It engages the question of listening differently to a call fortransformative justice, by attending to Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique as situatedwithin the settler-colonial context. I argue that by listening to anticolonial-queer calls fortransformative justice from the standpoint of the context in which they are made—rather thanas an act of charity or through hegemonic frameworks—the possibilities for responding tothem might be altered.The dual problem of listening and critiquing in the context of Palestinian anticolonial-queeractivism is exemplified by the 2012 Jadaliyya debate between U.S.-based queer scholars JasbirPuar and Maya Mikdashi, on the one hand, and the founder of alQaws for Sexual and GenderDiversity in Palestinian Society, Haneen Maikey, and U.S.-based ally and scholar HeikeSchotten, on the other. In that debate, Puar and Mikdashi criticized U.S. anti-pinkwashingactivists for falling into the trap of homonationalism, a term coined by Puar to describe “thehistorical convergence of state practices, transnational circuits of queer commodity cultureand human rights paradigms, and broader global phenomena such as the increasingentrenchment of Islamophobia.”13 Maikey and Schotten, for their part, were concerned thatsituating pinkwashing in the analytical framework of homonationalism elided the specificZionist context of Palestinian queers, notwithstanding the fact that Puar and Mikdashi chidedanti-pinkwashing activists for ignoring “‘divisive’ questions” regarding Palestinian liberationand Israel’s occupation.14 While Maikey and Schotten also problematized the singling out ofqueer Palestinians as objects of affection by transnational queer solidarity activists, they wereOther Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer CritiqueSpring 2018 || 47concerned that Puar and Mikdashi’s critique ignored a decade of Palestinian queer activism thatdeveloped its own analytical lenses and strategies.This debate was widely followed in anti-pinkwashing activism circles and it marked a watershedmoment. It also revealed an incommensurability between Puar’s analytic of homonationalism andPalestinian anticolonial-queer discourse regarding the Zionist context. Prior to the publication ofthe Puar-Mikdashi article, transnational queer organizing for BDS had been gaining considerablemomentum, as evidenced by the Palestinian Queer Activists Talk Politics tour of the United Statesin 2011, which included activist, academic, and NGO events on several U.S. campuses; boycottcampaigns such as “IGLYO Out of Israel” (IGLYO is the acronym for the International Lesbian,Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Youth and Student Organization);15 the emergenceof a number of Queers Against Israeli Apartheid (QuAIA) chapters across North American cities;16the publication of popular and academic articles; protest marches in large cities such as Toronto,Vancouver, and New York; and, the organization of a large conference on homonationalism andpinkwashing held in the United States shortly after the online debate took place. In contrast, theperiod that followed the online debate was marked by a dearth of initiatives and discussion, even asIsraeli pundits and their allies continued to mobilize pinkwashing discourses in Israel’s favor.17 Inthe words of QuAIA cofounder and social movement scholar Natalie Kouri-Towe, the Puar-Mikdashi article “destabilized the parameters of solidarity without generating a framework whereactivist attachments could be renegotiated.”18 This article scrutinizes the ways in which existingforms of solidarity remain narrow, precluding other forms of response to injustice in the Zionistcontext, and rendering them inaudible.In what follows, I first introduce the different scenes of speaking that have emerged since the2010 PQBDS solidarity call, with a specific focus on the Jadaliyya debate and on the analyticalgap between homonationalism and Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique. In the secondsection, I provide a different reading of that gap by examining the time and context in whichthe debate occurred. Here, I suggest that engaging with questions of time and context, ortemporality, might provide an insight into how the demands of Palestinians themselves getburied within international debates on the question of Palestine, and explore how the prismsof time and context may also point to alternative responses to a call for justice. In the thirdsection, I analyze the ways in which the temporality of critique shaped responses to injusticewithin the Jadaliyya debate. Finally, in the last section, I posit a listening strategy that hearsPalestinian anticolonial-queer critique differently by situating it within its specific Zionistsettler-colonial context and the broader struggle for Palestinian liberation. Here, I foregroundthe analytical frameworks and liberation strategies developed within the Palestiniananticolonial-queer movement’s own discourse.Pinkwashing/Anti-Pinkwashing: An ImpasseAt the Homonationalism and Pinkwashing Conference held at the City University of New Yorkin 2013, alQaws founder Haneen Maikey addressed the question of transnational solidarity activismand scholarship in the wake of the 2010 PQBDS call. “Are we in solidarity with Palestine, or are we insolidarity with the queers in Palestine?”Maikey asked the audience.19 The conference was the secondOther Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer Critique48 || Journal of Palestine Studieslarge-scale event organized by gay rights activist, author, and academic Sarah Schulman followingthe well-attended Palestinian Queer Activists Talk Politics tour of the United States in 2011. Theperiod between the two events witnessed the rising momentum of anti-pinkwashing activism inNorth America, while at the same time it created a particular scene of speaking from which(anti-)pinkwashing could be assessed and disputed within North American academy and activistcircles. Maikey’s question alluded to the ways in which anti-pinkwashing solidarity activistsundertook their engagement with Palestinian queers without reference to the context of Palestineas the site of Israel’s settler-colonial project. Her question invited the audience to imagine waysto respond to injustices against Palestinians that (1) were not limited to Palestinian queers, and(2) did not reenact a relationship of imperial benevolence, or a missionary impulse, but ratherfeatured Palestinian liberation as the central parameter of engagement. Maikey’s provocativequestion remains one of the main challenges to have emerged from the last decade of anti-pinkwashing activism and scholarship.A particular strand of anti-pinkwashing activism became the new touchstone of whatSchulman has termed the Queer International.20 The figure of the Queer International was ariposte to Joseph Massad’s Gay International, who characteristically imposes its own standards ofgay emancipation and sexual identity on the rest of the world.21 Schulman’s Israel/Palestine andthe Queer International starts from the unvoiced assumption that same-sex solidarity provides aplatform for Palestinian queer struggle (and not the struggle for Palestinian liberation) to bearticulated and imagined within the United States. In doing so, Schulman consolidates queernessas a politics of identity based on a same-sex solidarity stripped of power dynamics, and thus fallsinto the trap of tokenizing and romanticizing a particular version of “the queer Palestinian” as theQueer International’s new object of affection. Rather than incorporate a broader vision of thegeopolitical context, Schulman turns Palestinian liberation into a question about U.S.-Palestinianqueer solidarity.22 Maikey’s question interrogates the limits of Schulman’s figure as it attempts tomake Palestine more appealing to queer people in the Global North.Puar andMikdashi critique Schulman’s position in their Jadaliyya essay. “In fact,” they write, “wenote that many of the same assumptions that animate discourses of pinkwashing are unwittingly andsometimes intentionally reproduced in pinkwatching [anti-pinkwashing] efforts.”23 They also assertthat anti-pinkwashing activists fall into the trap of homonationalism: where pinkwashing seeks torecruit international queers to support the Israeli state by inviting them to its gay-friendly shores,some forms of anti-pinkwashing activism draw on similar models by producing a Palestinianqueer figure with whom North American queers can identify without having to engage thefundamental questions of Zionist settler colonialism raised by Palestinian queer activists.24In response to critiques such as Puar and Mikdashi’s, Jason Ritchie has pointed out that thequeer call for BDS quickly transformed into a struggle between “good” and “bad” queers in themetropolis. “Debates over pinkwashing in Western gay metropolises,” he writes, “have less to dowith actual instances of pinkwashing than with struggles over the nature of queerness in thecontext of neoliberalism and the War on Terror.”25 Ritchie points out that the appropriationof pinkwashing/anti-pinkwashing debates in North America is (perhaps productively) divisivesince it serves to distinguish between radical and liberal queer politics in the era of post-9/11angst and rising Islamophobia within predominantly white queer communities. Contrary toOther Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer CritiqueSpring 2018 || 49Puar and Mikdashi, who criticize anti-pinkwashing activists for not understanding homonationalism,Ritchie posits that the fault “lies not in the inability of queer activists to understand homonationalism,but in the conceptual limits of the theory,” which, he says, privileges the Western metropolis at thecenter of inquiry.26 In what follows, I examine the Jadaliyya debate with a focus on the way thathomonationalism—as a globally hegemonic analytical framework to understand pinkwashing—elides the question of Palestine and the demands of the BDS movement.Puar and Mikdashi’s article, “Pinkwatching and Pinkwashing: Interpenetration and itsDiscontents,” exemplifies the reification of the Western metropolis at the center of anti-pinkwashingefforts. Even as it critiques the failures of anti-pinkwashing activism in the Global North, thediscussion operates under similar geopolitical assumptions. Schulman’s Queer International andPuar’s homonationalism make particular demands on activists as to how they can/should respond toIsraeli occupation and pinkwashing, altogether eliding Palestinian anticolonial-queer critiques of thesexual politics of Zionist settler colonialism. Given that the publication of the Jadaliyya article wasfollowed by an impasse in transnational solidarity organizing, one must ask first, Why was that thecase? And second, What kinds of analytical challenges emerged afterward?Importantly, Puar and Mikdashi criticize the state of anti-pinkwashing activism in NorthAmerica for operating in accordance with, rather than in resistance to, pinkwashing’s liberalnarratives of progress, its single-issue identity politics, and its homonationalist underpinnings.In their view, such narratives are foundational to contemporary neoliberalism and the War onTerror, as well as U.S. and Israeli settler colonialism. They urge U.S. activists to ground theirwork in a larger analysis of settler-colonial violence both inside Israel/Palestine and in NorthAmerica/Turtle Island.27The Puar-Mikdashi article generated heated conversations within both transnational andPalestinian queer activist circles. Maikey and Schotten’s response resulted from a collectivewriting process in which Palestinian and transnational activists, myself included, tried to voicetheir frustrations with the authors’ standpoint. I was invited because I had been active inqueer transnational solidarity organizing since 2010; had helped develop the “pinkwatchingkit” for Pinkwatching Israel; and also took part in the planning of Queer Visions at the WorldSocial Forum: Free Palestine. The last initiative was a queer Palestinian-led effort toforeground Palestinian queer activism by bringing together queer and trans*28 activists (themajority of them Palestinian, Arab, and of color) working on BDS at the World Social Forumheld in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2012. In their response to Puar and Mikdashi, Maikey andSchotten write:We fully appreciate the importance of self-critique, especially for activist movements. How-ever, we think Puar and Mikdashi lean rather too heavily on the conceptual framework ofhomonationalism in their analysis of pinkwatching [anti-pinkwashing], making it do morework than it can bear. This overreliance on homonationalism obscures specific, politically rel-evant features of pinkwatching activism that are particular to Palestine and Palestine solidar-ity work. Moreover, we believe the authors’ self-exemptions from activist struggle pushestheir criticism dangerously close to a rehearsal of academic critique at the expense of contrib-uting to movement building.29Other Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer Critique50 || Journal of Palestine StudiesIn addition to pointing to the analytical gap between homonationalism and Palestinian queeractivism, Maikey and Schotten also allude to the timing of the Jadaliyya article. By publiclyengaging in the practice of self-critique, Maikey and Schotten argue, Puar and Mikdashi heightenedthe vulnerability of an already vulnerable claim, namely the Palestinian (queer) call for BDS. In thesame vein, the argument goes on, they ignored activist initiatives resisting the strand of anti-pinkwashing activism they criticized. Maikey and Schotten urge Puar and Mikdashi to understandanti-pinkwashing as part of a broader struggle against Zionist settler-colonialism rather thanreduce Palestinian queer analyses of pinkwashing to a struggle against homonationalism, or “settlerhomonationalism.”30 They write, “In Palestine, pinkwashing is part of the ongoing Nakba. BothZionism and pinkwashing depend on a notion of the prior destruction and continued negation ofPalestine and Palestinian belonging. . . . Zionism must be understood as a historically specific,racialized process through which different discourses of sexuality emerge that bolster rather thanundermine Zionist ideology.”31Maikey and Schotten also take issue with the way in which Puar and Mikdashi leveraged thePalestinian anticolonial-queer struggle to make a point about homonationalism. They drawattention to the dangers of erasing the specificities of and differences between U.S. and Zionistsettler colonialisms in the crafting of comparative solidarities, something Palestinian feministscholar Dana M. Olwan calls “assumptive solidarities.” Discussing the complexities of comparativework among indigenous communities in Turtle Island and Palestine, Olwan writes, “Assumptivesolidarity . . . make our allies’ causes and forms of resistance appear less foreign, less threatening,and less cumbersome. Assumptive solidarity does not move us; it moves others to us. It does nottransform our relationships with one another or with the lands on which we live, nor does itrequire our sustained, long-term, and wide-ranging commitments to work that is, at times,difficult, uneasy, and complicated.”32In a rejoinder to Maikey and Schotten, Puar and Mikdashi argue that their critique was aimedonly at U.S. anti-pinkwashing efforts and that regional organizing in the Middle East required itsown strategies. However, they fail either to recount what strategies had already emerged fromPalestine and the Middle East, or to discuss how such strategies might inform and challengemodes of solidarity and analytical frameworks available to activists and scholars in NorthAmerica. Even though homonationalism seems to have become a “global condition,” Puar andMikdashi argue that Palestinian organizing strategies to respond to such a condition and widentheir impact are regional.33 They elaborate (emphasis is mine),Homonationalism and pinkwashing are not parallel phenomen[a], rather pinkwashing is onemanifestation and practice that is made possible within and because of homonationalism. . . . Likemodernity, homonationalism can be resisted and re-signified, but not opted out of:we are all con-ditioned by it and through it. . . . So a more accurate read of our argument, rather than accusing usof somehow negating the specificity of Palestine, is that we were mapping out the relations betweenpinkwashing and homonationalism, or more precisely, the global conditions of homonationalismthat make a practice such as Israeli pinkwashing possible and legible in the first place. In connectingIsraeli pinkwashing to a broader global system of power networks, we were not minimizingPalestine, rather demonstrating the myriad of actors that converge to enable such a practice.34Other Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer CritiqueSpring 2018 || 51In an implicit response to this debate, Palestinian activist and critic Nayrouz Abu Hatoum callsattention to “the burden of queer Palestinians.”35 The burden is manifest not only in the demand torespond to existing dominant discourses around pinkwashing or in being tokenized by the globalanti-pinkwashing movement, but it results specifically from being expected to be responsive to“particular academic notions as well as processes.”36 For Palestinian anticolonial-queer activists,such notions set the terms of engagement, and if they want to become legible to academic andactivist audiences in the Global North, they must adhere to an agenda that requires them “to bepoliticized in accordance to the international political standards or discourses.”37 I argue that inaddition to the tokenizing tendency of the Queer International, more progressive intellectualtrajectories such as Puar and Mikdashi’s also remain intransigent vis-à-vis other forms ofengagement taking shape outside and in response to such trajectories.38 The next sectionaddresses conceptions of time and the context of critique to further explore the burden set forthby Abu Hatoum.The Burial of a Scene of SpeakingPuar’s homonationalism has become the dominant critical lens applied when challenging therelationship between sexual politics and the state. It attends to particular sites of violence withinthe context of the bio- and necropolitics of modernity. More specifically, homonationalismaddresses the management of life and death through racialized and sexualized regimes of power.However, to understand homonationalism as a “global condition” that we “are all conditioned byand through” prevents from becoming audible other scenes of speaking that also seek to addressviolence and injustice, albeit in different ways.39Following Abu Hatoum’s argument about the burdensomeness of analytical frameworks to queerPalestinians, I turn to Jean-François Lyotard’s concept of the differend, and to the temporality ofcritique, as other starting points from which to reflect on the Jadaliyya debate. I will show howparticular analytics, including some of those deemed the most radical, create a situation in whichPalestinian anticolonial-queer critique is always already mediated by hegemonic critical frameworks.Such analytics do not only enact a burden on queer Palestinians, but they significantly limit theways in which to engage Palestinian anticolonial-queer critiques. Using Lyotard’s concept, itbecomes clear that Palestinian anticolonial-queer conceptual and political interventions remaininaudible.In his analysis of encounters between differently positioned groups and discourses, for examplethat of the Algerian struggle for independence and liberation from French colonial rule, Lyotardlooks at the ways in which victims of injustice get caught up in what he calls the differend—asituation in which the victim cannot give an account of their victimization, not because they donot have the capacity to speak, but because their narrative cannot operate within the frameworkauthorized by the law and its hegemonic discourse, such that the wrong done to a victim ofinjustice is not presentable as a wrong. “A case of a differend between two parties takes placewhen the ‘regulation’ of the conflict that opposes them is done in the idiom of one of the partieswhile the wrong suffered by the other is not signified in that idiom,” Lyotard writes.40 As he goeson to add, it is the case “where a plaintiff is divested of the means to argue and becomes for thatOther Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer Critique52 || Journal of Palestine Studiesreason a victim”41 since there is generally no “universal rule of judgment between heterogeneousgenres.”42 As regards the Jadaliyya debate, Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique is not signifiedin the idiom of Puar and Mikdashi.In her brief discussion of the concept, Spivak quotes Lyotard as saying that the differend is evidentwhen human beings are summoned by language to recognize that “what remains to be phrasedexceeds what they can presently phrase; and that they must be allowed [my italics] to instituteidioms that do not yet exist.”43 Spivak is interested in the question of “who” institutes new idiomsand how this pertains to the question of what is allowed to become recognizable. She points to thelimits of Lyotards’s conception of the differend when it is restricted to a subject becomingrecognizable within the legal sphere. In other words, what are the structures of representation thataccompany the quest for new idioms? I would add that even if the victim of injustice adopts thelanguage of judgment, this does not necessarily guarantee her becoming audible/intelligible to thatlegal system, but rather consolidates the idiom in which that system gained its legitimacy. Thisrenders other forms of struggle, especially those exposing injustice produced through law, eitherillegible or illegitimate.Saba Mahmood turns to a different setting where the meaning of what constitutes injustice andits alleviation are at stake: the 2005 Danish cartoon controversy, in which a popular Danishnewspaper published editorial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammed in ways that elicitedpain and outrage among some Muslim communities around the globe. Mahmood argues thatinstead of understanding what caused injury within these communities, the debate immediatelyturned to conventional legal paradigms—in particular, blasphemy and free speech laws. She positsthat the distinction between religion and secularism within the modern legal paradigm is not asunbridgeable as it appears to be: she points to the ways in which two parties to a dispute operatingfrom seemingly distinct starting points might ultimately not be that disparate in how they positionthemselves. This is important for my argument as it exemplifies how there might exist certain,perhaps unwitting, (discursive) reproductions of the structures of violence we seek to critique. Inthe case of the dispute between Puar and Mikdashi and anti-pinkwashing activists in NorthAmerica, their reliance on a particular radical or liberal idiom might not be so disparate at all.At the same time, Mahmood also highlights how certain forms of Muslim pain and outrage over thecartoons remained illegible within the responses that circulated during and after the controversy.I am especially interested in Mahmood’s contribution as she attempts to draw attention to thosesites of struggle that exceed or undermine hegemonic critical and analytical frameworks.On the question of how to respond to injury, Mahmood problematizes liberal discourses of legalredress as self-evident sites for resolving injustice. She asks what “ethical and political questions areelided in the immediate resort to the law to resolve the dispute [on both sides of the controversy]?”44She understands modern law as enabling some injuries to become intelligible while keeping othersinvisible. She asks, “What are the conditions of intelligibility in a world where identity politicsreign and the juridical language of rights dominates?”45 Resorting to modern law or otherhegemonic modalities of redress leads to an impoverished understanding of issues and restrictsour imaginaries to juridical rights and state sanction.46 The process of grasping what is left out“requires more than simply critique” and demands that we pay attention to the differing ethicaland affective ways in which scenes of speaking become intelligible.47Other Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer CritiqueSpring 2018 || 53Mahmood’s essay is insightful because it explores “the thick texture and traditions of ethicaland intersubjective norms that provide the substrate for legal arguments (enshrined in thelanguage of public order).”48 Central to the failure of the law to attend to injury is a problemof “the differential of power characteristic of minority-majority relations within the context ofnation-states.”49 Mahmood urges us to understand the ways in which idiom determines theoperationalization of the question of injustice. She shows that there are different andsometimes overlapping scenes of speaking at work. More importantly, she attempts to providea different starting point for reflecting on the problem of listening, urging us to see it as notonly operating on the level of idiom, but through the very affective and relational attachmentswe have to hegemonic frameworks or particular modalities and concepts of critique.Mahmood implicitly shows the limits of Lyotard’s insistence on idiom. By attending to injuryas not only a linguistic but also as an affective and ethical structure, she draws attention toother elements that need to be taken into account in addressing the question of injustice andof listening. Lyotard’s insistence on a certain language becoming audible within the rule ofjudgment does not account for what happens when the claim of the victim of injusticeremains unintelligible to that system in spite of her use of that very language. For instance,when Palestinian BDS activists deploy the language of international law and human rights butthat system remains unaccountable to their appeals, that lack of accountability is as much amatter of epistemology as it is one of colonial and imperial power.The concerns raised by Mahmood are similar to those raised by Puar and Mikdashi. All threeauthors address the ways in which certain ideals and values, including those affirmed by the legalsphere, secure the ascendency of the white modern subject to the detriment of entire populations.Mahmood’s analysis, however, goes beyond a critique of single-issue identity politics and nationalist,settler-colonial, and imperialist structures of power. She seeks to destabilize the very ways in whichcritique operates by drawing attention to the problem of the critique’s idiom and context. In herview, assumptions of time and context determine how injustice becomes (un)intelligible. Theseassumptions elide other scenes of speaking. Mahmood’s attention to the temporality of critiqueallows a different entry point to the Jadaliyya debate that shows how despite Puar and Mikdashi’srelevant interventions, the burial of another scene of speaking—Palestinian anticolonial-queercritique—continues to operate.Anticolonial-Queer Critique and the Limits of HomonationalismPolitics is asymmetrical, it is provisional, you have broken the theory,and that’s the burden you carry when you become political.—Gayatri Chakravorty SpivakThe Jadaliyya debate reveals how powerful a framework homonationalism is in its restrictionof Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique to specific parameters (or idioms) of struggle. The Puar-Mikdashi article itself becomes the dominant framework that imagines homonationalism as themain terrain of struggle for queer Palestinians. In this framing, Palestinian anticolonial-queercritique only becomes audible as a critique of homonationalism. It disregards the multiple facetsOther Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer Critique54 || Journal of Palestine Studiesof Palestinian anticolonial-queer activism that, in addition to anti-pinkwashing, insist on buildingnew registers for thinking about gender and sexual diversity inside Palestinian society; dismantlingpatriarchal narratives of Palestinian liberation; and rejecting the racial-sexual politics of a settler-colonial regime of subjugation and control.50 Rendering Palestinian anticolonial-queer critiquesimply regional or specific also risks precluding critiques coming from the so-called region ascentral conceptual interventions. Such interventions might be able to alter our understanding ofhomonationalism and/or the role of Zionist racial-sexual politics within global relations of power.Viewing the Jadaliyya debate through the lens of temporality (that is, the time and context ofthe critique) provides insight into the ways in which Puar and Mikdashi’s interventionprecipitated a crisis in anti-pinkwashing circles. The transnational solidarity movement cameto a standstill after the Jadaliyya debate critiqued the failure of North American anti-pinkwashing activists to engage in a more meaningful interrogation of settler colonialism andhomonationalism, both at home (in North America) and abroad. This not only underscores theprecariousness of activist commitments, but it also raises the question of “who” is responding tothe PQBDS call for justice, and what kind of global power relations do such commitments(perhaps unwittingly) (re)enact?By addressing the role of time and context in the Jadaliyya debate, I hope to point to the gapsin understanding between North American anti-pinkwashing efforts (radical and liberal) andPalestinian anticolonial-queer critique that led to the impasse described above. At the sametime, I argue that conceptualizing these divergences as different scenes of speaking opens upother avenues for understanding Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique, with the hope that itmight be scripted differently. The politics of pinkwashing and anti-pinkwashing can be (re-)negotiated when Palestinian anticolonial-queer politics are firmly situated within a Zionistsettler-colonial context as well as the movement for Palestinian liberation and BDS. Startingwith the demands of the BDS movement and the multifaceted forms of Palestinian resistanceprovides other frameworks for responding to injustice. I argue that we need to turn todifferent scenes of speaking that operate alongside Puar and Mikdashi’s. Considering thoseother scenes illuminates the power dynamics and different contexts of critique at work. Indoing this, I also address the challenge posed by Maikey and Schotten to think beyond thelens of homonationalism in order to foreground the violence of—and the resistance to—the Zionist settler-colonial state as the starting point from which to articulate a response tothe PQBDS call. Not that Puar and Mikdashi deny that Palestine is a settler-colonial contextor argue against BDS. Rather, these become mere backdrops to the articulation of the globalvalence of homonationalism. Even as the framework of homonationalism continues to operateon the audibility of Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique, attuning to other scenes ofspeaking opens a way out of the dispute and the impasse it created.Palestinian anticolonial-queer activism draws on a decade of experiences with queer organizingin Palestine based on a two-pronged approach: considering the role of Zionist racial-sexual politicsin Palestine and formulating an anticolonial-queer discourse under such violent conditions.51Maikey and Schotten negotiate a different lens to engage in the debate, which remains illegiblewithin the framework of homonationalism posited by Puar and Mikdashi. The latter state, “ratherthan accusing us of somehow negating the specificity of Palestine . . . we were mapping out theOther Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer CritiqueSpring 2018 || 55relations between pinkwashing and homonationalism.”52 (I would argue that their decision to do soand not to emphasize resistance tactics formulated in Palestine itself diminishes Palestiniananticolonial-queer critiques of Zionist racial-sexual politics.) Maikey and Schotten, on the otherhand, foreground Palestine as the central context for anti-pinkwashing critiques to emerge. Theyworry about the reduction of activist struggles for Palestine’s liberation to academic debate orcritique. They highlight the dangers of separating intellectual modes of critique from activist workon the ground and push for more accountability between these different fields of inquiry.Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique is a central conceptual intervention within the larger BDSmovement, they argue. Rather than simply adding anti-pinkwashing to the larger BDS discourse,anticolonial-queer insights into Zionist settler colonialism’s racial-sexual politics represent a novelstand, one that tackles those politics head on.53The problem with the Puar and Mikdashi interventions lies in the authors’ reluctance to tackleother forms of engagement while persisting in their critique of the racial-sexual politics ofmodernity as one that no one can “opt out of.”54 Rather than being responsive to different modesof engagement that operate both within Zionist settler-colonial modernity—and also in strugglewith it—homonationalism becomes a globally hegemonic terrain of engagement that no one can“opt out of.” In the words of Schotten and Maikey, Puar and Mikdashi’s approach insulates themfrom the “politically relevant features of pinkwatching activism that are particular to Palestine andPalestine solidarity work.”55If everything is already steeped in homonationalism and modernity, does Puar andMikdashi’s critique then render unintelligible the forms of political struggle emerging withinthe sites of violence their critique addresses? Does this mean that it becomes necessary togive up on, or extricate oneself from those sites for the sake of being theoretically salient orcritically consistent? How does one reconcile critique and the political commitments withinwhich the critique is made without reducing “one to the other”?56 These questions warrantfurther exploration if we want radical theoretical critique to bear on activist practice andvice versa.Where Puar and Mikdashi use homonationalism to critique the structural underpinnings ofmodernity, Mahmood offers a way to think beyond modernity’s dominant idioms. Her focus onthe affective attachments to modern law and the practice of secular critique as determinants ofthe question of injustice provide a way to understand contemporary pinkwashing and anti-pinkwashing discourses differently. From this perspective, the problem with anti-pinkwashingnarratives such as Schulman’s lies in their affective attachments to the idea of a queersolidarity that reproduces homonationalism’s scripts and its identity politics. Attachments tocritiques of homonationalism operate in a similar manner, failing to recognize the limits thatthe concept itself imposes on the question of injustice in Palestine. Such attachments—wemight call them liberal and radical within secular modernity’s script—usurp indigenous sitesof struggle, and therefore remain unresponsive to the Palestinian anticolonial-queer critiquesfrom within Palestine. In this framing, Palestinian anticolonial-queer scenes of speaking standout from these dominant attachments while also exemplifying their influence. Such scenes donot render a critique of homonationalism obsolete: they undermine its hegemonic sway andquestion how it bears upon the present in different ways.Other Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer Critique56 || Journal of Palestine StudiesToward Other Scenes of SpeakingA few months after the Jadaliyya debate, Palestinian and transnational queer and trans*solidarity activists came together in Porto Alegre, Brazil, with an initiative titled “Queer Visions atthe World Social Forum: Free Palestine.” The debate inspired the Porto Alegre participants todevelop a deepened understanding of why Puar and Mikdashi’s critique generated suchfrustration among people working in the movement, especially for Palestinian queer activists, andto examine how Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique operates beyond simply articulatingpinkwashing as a colonial project. As one of the co-organizers of the event, I remember a shift indiscourse during the preparatory phase of Queer Visions from a pinkwashing framework to onefeaturing the framework of “Zionist sexual politics.” The shift enabled activists to clarify theracial-sexual politics of Zionist settler colonialism as the broader terrain for pinkwashing toemerge in the first place. Primary concerns were to promote “an analysis of the use of sexualpolitics in Israeli settler-colonial discourse,” to “explore the linkages between queer liberation andthe struggle for Palestinian liberation” and the specificities of the struggles faced by queer BDSactivists in their respective contexts, and to focus on how queer BDS activism “can productivelyaddress queer communities without falling into the trap of singling out queer communities, andwithout losing sight of goals” in line with core BDS demands (listed in the introduction at thebeginning of this article).57At the World Social Forum General Assembly, Queer Visions positioned racial-sexual politicsas central to understanding the Zionist context and to formulating tactics of resistance. It urgedPalestine justice activists to understand the insidious racial-sexual politics of the settler state. It calledon the larger BDS movement to integrate queer perspectives and analyses into their anticolonialwork, and emphasized that Palestinian anticolonial-queer activism was not limited to anti-pinkwashing.58 Queer Visions developed several BDS tactics, including a template for boycotting gaytourism to Israel, and it sought to consolidate and reflect on transnational queer BDS efforts. Therewas, unfortunately, very little follow-up after the WSF. Only in 2015 were some of the networksresuscitated to create a Boycott Gay Tourism to Israel campaign in collaboration with the PalestinianCampaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI).59Palestinian anticolonial-queer critiques remain inaudible within the normative frameworkof secular modernity operative in both radical and liberal responses to PQBDS’s call forboycott. The Jadaliyya debate reveals how secular modernity acts as “an ineluctable aspect ofour present condition, as both political imagination and epistemological limit.”60 At the sametime, foregrounding Palestinian anticolonial-queer critiques might offer other forms ofpolitical imagination and of listening that address injustice within the framework of the settlerstate and in line with the demands of the BDS movement and Palestinian liberation. Rather thanescaping the modern secular condition, this article has argued for valuing Palestinian anticolonial-queer practices that transcend dominant paradigms, pointing to different frameworks andcontexts that can operate simultaneously alongside, and in refusal of, the colonized condition.Even if Palestinian anticolonial-queer critiques are relegated to a secondary or subsidiary statuswithin the parameters articulated by Puar and Mikdashi, it does not mean that they are not takingshape.Other Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer CritiqueSpring 2018 || 57The superimposition of intellectual critique onto the politics of anticolonial-queer activism hashad damaging effects on an already vulnerable movement. Talal Asad warns, “Every criticaldiscourse has institutional conditions that define what it is, who it recognizes, what it aims at,what it is destroying and why”—meaning that nothing is neutral in critique.61 He provocativelyargues that “conquest might be critique’s primary function.”62 Within the context of the Jadaliyyadebate, how critique might determine what can be heard, seen, or felt reveals the difficulties ofnegotiating the relationship between academic writing and Palestinian resistance.While the Jadaliyya debate highlights how academic critique runs the risk of erasing acontext of struggle, it also reveals the ways in which Palestinian anticolonial-queer critiquesrefuse to be relegated to a position of unintelligibility. Although Palestinian anticolonial-queercritiques always risk remaining unintelligible within existing critical frameworks, theysimultaneously lay bare the question of how to respond to injustice and dictate the resort toterms of engagement that take into consideration the geopolitical context of Zionist settlercolonialism. Israel’s settler-colonial occupation of Palestine is not simply a site of violentdispossession for Palestinians that reduces them to the status of immobilized victims in needof saving; it is also a spatiotemporal plane for anticolonial-queer imaginaries. Theseimaginaries operate in the present and they undermine both the legitimating processes andcoercive mechanisms of Zionist settler colonialism and its racial-sexual politics. They not onlydraw attention to injustice committed against Palestinians but also offer a different lens throughwhich to understand injustice, to listen to a call for justice, and to formulate a response. Suchimaginaries demand attentiveness to the settler-colonial context of Israel/Palestine and to the waysin which local activist groups formulate tactics of resistance. Taking these imaginaries as a startingpoint might offer different insights into the question of injustice and the matters of its alleviationoutside existing parameters of struggle.By rejecting the existing parameters of critique and placing Palestinian liberation front andcenter in the path of engagement, Palestinian anticolonial-queer activism opens up other avenues forresponding to a Palestinian call for justice that are predicated on creating more socially just futuresbeyond the settler state that persists under occupation. In the Jadaliyya debate, Maikey and Schottenrefuse existing hegemonic parameters of struggle as all-encompassing. They draw attention to theneed to think strategically about the relationship between activism and critique, and about thedifferent but also overlapping contexts and frameworks in which the two operate. For its part,the politics of Palestinian anticolonial-queer activism creates a decolonial-queer imaginary beyondthe racial-sexual parameters of the settler state, envisioning a future beyond the settler state andbeyond conventional understandings of Palestinian national liberation. In fleeting moments, thesemodes of engagement experience a freedom that is not yet come, that is simultaneously denied andimagined, as well as felt, lived, and embodied.About the AuthorMikki Stelder obtained her PhD from the Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis in early 2018, with adissertation titled “Queering the Occupation: FromZionist Sexual Politics to PalestinianDecolonial-QueerImaginaries.” Her most recent publication, “‘From the Closet into the Knesset’: Zionist Sexual Politics andthe Formation of Settler Subjectivity,” appeared in Settler Colonial Studies in 2017.Other Scenes of Speaking: Listening to Palestinian Anticolonial-Queer Critique58 || Journal of Palestine StudiesENDNOTES1 PQBDS, “Palestinian Queers for BDS Call upon all Queer groups and organizations and individualsaround the world to Boycott the Apartheid State of Israel,” statement dated 27 June, PalestinianQueers for BDS, 28 June 2010, https://pqbds.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/palestinian-queers-for-bds-call-upon-all-queer-groups-organizations-and-individuals-around-the-world-to-boycott-the-apartheid-state-of-israel/.2 “Palestinian Civil Society Call for BDS,” open letter, BDS, 9 July 2005, http://bdsmovement.net/call.3 Pinkwatching Israel activists live on both sides of the Green Line that distinguishes between Israeland the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt).4 Angela Y.

    "abstract": "Palestinian Queers for BDS first called on the international LGBTQI community to be in solidarity with Palestinians and support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign in 2010. PQBDS argued that Israel was using gay rights and gay lives to pinkwash state-sanctioned violence against Palestinians. Since then, much has been said and written about Israel's pinkwashing campaign and the violence it endorses and engenders. But much remains unsaid about Palestinian anticolonial-queer modes of engagement that persist despite Israel's settler-colonial project. With specific attention to the 2012 Jadaliyya debate between Jasbir Puar and Maya Mikdashi, on the one hand, and Haneen Maikey and Heike Schotten, on the other, this article discusses various activist and scholarly responses to Israel's pinkwashing campaign, and particularly how these responses elide Palestinian anticolonial-queer activism in different ways. Ultimately, this article asks: What becomes (in)audible as a Palestinian anticolonial-queer critique",
