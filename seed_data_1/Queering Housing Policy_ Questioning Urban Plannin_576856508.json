Half of the urban population in Namibia lives in precarious housing con‐ditions. Cities like Windhoek and Walvis Bay are among the most unequal in the world. Such inequalities translate intosignificant gaps in housing quality, security, and service provision. These inequalities are acutely felt by LGBTIQ+ popu‐lations that already face other forms of exclusion from economic and social life and fundamental human rights. A newNational Housing Policy—emphasizing the right to housing—is about to be adopted in Namibia, but would it address theconcerns of queer populations? This article asks what it means to engage with Namibia’s new National Housing Policythrough the lens of queer decolonial thought. It presents an exploratory study of the questions emerging at the mar‐gins of the discussion on the National Housing Policy. The objective was to develop an exploratory research agenda for aqueer decolonial perspective on housing in Namibia. In the context of enormous housing shortages, a queer decolonialperspective emphasizes radical inclusion as a principle for housing provision. The exploration of shared queer experiencesin accessing housing suggests that the themes of belonging, identity, and safety may support the development of suchan agenda. Queer decolonial thought has thus three implications for an agenda of research on housing in Namibia. First,it calls for understanding what community and belonging mean for LGBTIQ+ people. Second, queer decolonial thoughtposes questions about citizenship, particularly given the shift to a view of the state as creating housing opportunities(through land rights and basic services) and support mechanisms for incremental housing. Queer decolonial thought callsfor identifying the multiple ways the state misrecognizes individuals who do not conform to prescribed identities and sex‐ual orientations. Third, queer decolonial thought invites reflection on the constitution of safe spaces in aggressive urbanenvironments and the multiple layers of perceived safety constructed through diverse institutions and public spaces.Keywordscoloniality; housing; LGBTIQ+; Namibia; queer decolonial thought; queer housingIssueThis article is part of the issue “Queer(ing) Urban Planning and Municipal Governance” edited by Alison L.

IntroductionSince independence, the housing question has been asalient political issue in the Republic of Namibia (hence‐forth Namibia; Bogosi, 1992). The National HousingPolicy (NHP) adopted in 1991 recognized a diversity ofhousing needs. In 2009, a revision of the NHP prioritisedhomeownership and private provision under the assump‐tion that people could access loans. The fundamentalassumptions of those regulations excluded most of thepopulation in Namibia. For example, most Namibiansdo not qualify for mortgages under current regula‐tions and cannot access the conventional housing mar‐ket (Chiripanhura, 2018). For those LGBTIQ+ collectivesUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 164already suffering discrimination in their social and work‐ing lives, access to housing is an additional challenge.A revised NHP has been under negotiation betweenthe Ministry of Urban and Rural Development (2022)and its stakeholders. The draft document envisions anew era of housing policy in Namibia. It follows six prin‐ciples of housing provision: adequate, targeted, incre‐mental, people‐focused, learning‐focused, and account‐able (Table 1). The aim is to facilitate access to housingfor the majority of the population on low incomes,especially those living in informal conditions, througha dual strategy of informal settlement upgrading andincremental greenfield development. The objective ofthe NHP is to deliver housing opportunities for popu‐lations on ultra‐low (monthly household income under€250 or N$5,000) and low incomes (monthly householdincome range €250–500), which constitute 62.4% and25.1% of the population, respectively (Ministry of Urbanand Rural Development, 2022). The draft for consulta‐tion proposes enshrining the right to adequate hous‐ing in the constitution, following a recommendation ofthe Second Namibian Land Conference (Melber, 2019).The stakeholder consultation of the draft has broughtabout a sense of opportunity for a possible paradigmshift in housing policy, but some voices call for caution.Neighboring South Africa has already attempted a con‐stitutional approach to the right to housing, creatinga state obligation to provide habitation to the poorestpeople and, in some cases, preventing forced evictions.However, the state has struggled to keepupwith demandand rising housing expectations (Turok & Scheba, 2019).The enormity of the housing crisis in Namibia calls forscalable programs. At the same time, many difficulties inaccessing housing stem from the deployment of gener‐alized assumptions about what kind of housing peopleneed and how they can access it, which do not alwayscorrespond to the realities of urban living. The supplyapproach of the previous housing policy in Namibia didnotmeet the housing demands of almost 90%of the pop‐ulation. While the new policy might improve upon thisin terms of reach, the 2022 revision of the NHP may con‐tinue to exclude vulnerable groups, such as LGBTIQ+ pop‐ulations, if specific provisions for their circumstances arenot explicitly included in the policy.Access to housing is a critical component of stabilityin LGBTIQ+ lives, and it provides the foundation to sup‐port livelihoods, provide security, and facilitate accessto healthcare (Badgett, 2014). Access to housing is rou‐tinely impeded by forms of active and passive discrimina‐tion, from deprioritizing families that do not match het‐eronormative requirements in housing policies to over‐looking measures to address the specific requirementsof LGBTIQ+ people to access bureaucracies, informa‐tion, and resources (Lim et al., 2013). Further compli‐cating matters, LGBTIQ+ people may also lack a broadersocial network of support, for example, when they areestranged from their family because of their sexualor gender orientation (Mills, 2015). Heteronormativeassumptions are thus inherently exclusionary. For exam‐ple, policies to tackle homelessness focused on meetingthe needs of families automatically exclude vulnerable(single) individuals who do not meet those requirements(Carr et al., 2022).The emerging body of literature on housing issuesamong LGBTIQ+ people shows that even when policyand planning attempt to be deliberately inclusive, theyfall short of addressing the needs of queer populations.The queer constitutes a new frontier of exclusion inwhich affected individuals are constructed as undeserv‐ing, deviant, and abject in ways that generate multipleforms of intended and unintended discrimination (Carret al., 2022). In this context, urban planning and hous‐ing policies must take additional steps to welcome queergroups already excluded by default (Doan, 2010). ThisTable 1. Core principles in the draft of the revision of the NHP.Principle DefinitionAdequate Interventions shall be guided by the principles of the UN‐defined Right to Adequate Housing whichoutlines a broad understanding of housing as an enabler for social and economic empowermentTargeted Interventions and public expenditure shall be proportional to locally varying social and incomedemographics, leaving noone behindIncremental The scale and complexity of the urban land and housing challenges require incrementalapproaches towards obtaining adequate housing for the majorityPeople‐focused Ensuring broad public ownership requires continuous public engagement, education, andcapacitation for inhabitants, stakeholders, and government officials at all levelsLearning‐focused Effective housing solutions will evolve through learning by doing and assessed continuouslythrough monitoring and evaluationAccountable The vast policy scope and its financial implications require accountability and consistentmonitoring and evaluation to achieve social equityUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 165calls for no less than a shift of perspective on hous‐ing justice: a new perspective that not only recognizesqueer experiences but also changes with them. Queerutopianism refers to perspectives that demand a pro‐found transformation of societies shaped by heteropa‐triarchy, white supremacy, and imperialism (EstebanMuñoz, 2009). Queer utopianism recognizes the inher‐ent resistive character of queer responses, the chal‐lenges they pose to the current structure of the socialpolicy, and the possibilities of concrete practices thatbuild forms of survival and hope (including situatedpractices of care, mutual aid, and challenges to disem‐powering practices; England, 2022). Histories of colo‐nial and postcolonial domination have shaped ideas ofhome with the archetypes of the nuclear family andthe housewife. Imperialism extended this heteropatri‐archal model, which became a kernel of the forms ofcoloniality ubiquitous in the postcolonial era (Kapoor,2015). Heteronormative ideologies in postcolonial con‐texts hinder equitable access to housing (Nyanzi, 2013).Dominant notions of the home link good citizenship andnationhood to sexual categories (Gairola, 2006). This isa constant in the development of housing policy forqueer populations, specifically in rapidly urbanizing areaswhere providing universal access to housing is an urgentpriority. Equitable access to adequate housing calls fornew paradigms that recognize the intimate connectionbetween queer discrimination and coloniality (Tudor,2021) and celebrate the fact that planning for queer pop‐ulations is planning that works for everyone in the city(Doan, 2015). Planning for queer populations must alsobe planning that actively decolonizes existing ways ofthinking about housing, planning, and public policy.This article asks what it means to engage withNamibia’s new NHP through the lens of queer decolo‐nial thought—a form of queer utopianism that under‐stands queer liberation and decolonization as synonyms.The objective is to develop an exploratory researchagenda to develop a queer decolonial perspective onhousing in Namibia. The research used a multi‐methodsstrategy, including “drawn interviews” and two work‐shops with members of LGBTIQ+ communities in the cityof Walvis Bay to formulate research questions that caninform a queer decolonial perspective on housing. In thecontext of enormous housing shortages, a queer decolo‐nial perspective emphasizes radical inclusion as a princi‐ple for housing provision, which is sensitive to the formsof exclusion at the margins. The exploration of sharedqueer experiences in accessing housing suggests that thethemes of belonging, identity, and safety may supportthe development of such an agenda.2. Queering Housing, Housing Queer Communities2.1. Queer Decolonial Thought and HousingOur analysis builds on the intersection of queer anddecolonial thought. Tamale’s (2020) account of decolo‐nization brings forward the experience of queer lives inAfrica,which are often left out of the literature on decolo‐niality. Tamale’s thought differentiates between colonial‐ism and coloniality. While colonization refers to a sys‐tematic project of territorial occupation and labor andresource exploitation, coloniality instead emphasizes thelong‐standing patterns of power resulting from that pro‐cess, manifested particularly in the dominance of certainprocesses of knowledge production (Tamale, 2020). Evenwhen and where colonization is over, coloniality contin‐ues. This is an argument that decolonial thinkers haveexplored, compounding various forms of oppression intowhat they term “coloniality” (Maldonado‐Torres, 2008;Mignolo & Walsh, 2018). Tamale follows Quijano (2000)in highlighting the endurance of eurocentric perspec‐tives in the production of knowledge. Eurocentric ideasbecome instruments for organizing the social order,including race, gender, and sexuality. These forms ofcoloniality become naturalized and, beyond a form ofpolitical and economic colonization, subsequently colo‐nize processes of thinking and reduce autonomy.The colonial project thus suppresses heterogeneity,simplifying people’s social roles and dissociating themfrom their experiences (Tamale, 2020). Colonial legaciesalso shape how certain practices—and hence the peo‐ple linked to those practices—are deemed as incorrect,unsanitary, or uncivilized, without challenging the infras‐tructure systems that reproduce those practices (Alda‐Vidal & Browne, 2021). The colonial project also shapesthe morality of urban life and its relationship with theenvironment and its artefacts. It also shapes governanceprocesses; even participatory processes are drenched ina colonial stench where deserving communities are sin‐gled out from the unruly mass (Mulumba et al., 2021).The family is a crucial entry point for queer decolo‐nial thought (e.g., Hunt & Holmes, 2015). Tamale (2020)examines family law as a sphere where coloniality can beobserved. Tamale explains how the British Protectoratein Uganda established a conceptual separation betweenstate and personal law. This dichotomy shielded thedomestic family from state intrusion and introducedthe male‐headed family as the system’s nucleus forheteropatriarchal‐capitalist reproduction (Tamale, 2020).This institutionalization of a British understanding of thefamily established a previously absent hardline distinc‐tion between public and private spaces, normalized afixed conception of the ideal family, and reduced theautonomy of non‐dominant family members. In a post‐colonial context, it is difficult to overlook the dual char‐acter of the home as both a site ofmaterial comfort and alocus of symbolic power (Blunt & Varley, 2004). Hayden’s(1982) work on the relationship between homemakingand nationhood already emphasized the fundamentallypolitical character of the home alongside a series ofprescriptions about how the home must be inhabitedand, crucially, with which identities. Colonialism put thehome and inhabitation at the centre of the imperial polit‐ical project.Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 166Colonialism, however, did not unfold over blankslates but built upon the existing political conditions ofdifferent locations. In Namibia, ethnographic researchsuggests that Christianity, rather than coloniality, shapedthe structure of Namibian society (McKittrick, 2002).Christianmissionaries sought to ban traditional practicesby imposing heteropatriarchal family models, effectivelyeroding alternative ideas of familiar or affective relation‐ships (Murray & Roscoe, 1998). During the colonial occu‐pation, familiar or affective relationshipswere secondaryto economic priorities. For example, entire populationswere displaced throughout the territory, separating fam‐ilies along lines of gender and physical ability throughthe infamous contract labor system (Hishongwa, 1992).Mixed layers of heteropatriarchal norms, deployedwhenthey served Christianization first and colonization later,have endured in the post‐independence period.Urban planning during colonial occupation priori‐tized public and intimate forms of urban space thatactively excluded the non‐normative. As a result, theexpression of solidarities and affections has been largelyexcluded from urban space, not only in public spaces butalso in shared spaces within the home. In a world wherequeer people live under constant threat (legal, cultural,institutional), multiple hiding processes are at work, andthe possibilities for expressing queerness are contingentupon the goodwill of those witnessing the event. Thisleads to apparently contradictory forms of spatial orga‐nization in which nuclear family homes exist alongsidesites where queerness is welcome or where heteronor‐mative spaces are transformed into queer ones in anad hoc manner. Examples of these transformations areentertainment venues (e.g., bars and clubs) or publicopen spaces (e.g., malls or waterfront walkways), butalso when a café allows for queer expression at specificset times (e.g., the evening) or in sectioned spaces (e.g.,a back room). The home itself may be a contingent spacefor the expression of queer solidarities but, at the sametime, queer thought questions the home as a stable cat‐egory that can be found within the confines of housing.A queer decolonial perspective on housing thus high‐lights three elements of analysis: (a) the symbolic func‐tioning of the home as it is linked to specific notions of cit‐izenship and nationhood, which separates deserving andundeserving subjects; (b) heteronormativemodels of thenuclear family that are reinforced through the incorpora‐tion of the home in the urban economy as a unit of repro‐duction; and (c) how the home operates in contradictoryways as a site of safety in an aggressive environment ofrapid urban change.2.2. Enduring Colonialities of Housing In NamibiaWith the recognition of the realities of rapid urbaniza‐tion and the assertion that 66% of the urban popula‐tion (short of one million) live in an informal settlement,the revised NHP shifts policy direction radically. Housingpolicy lies within a complex legal framework, whichemphasizes the production of housing in a “formal” way.Under apartheid, urban development planning servedthe needs of the minority white population, while blackpeople had no right to own urban land, and inhabitedsub‐serviced, but heavily regulated, townships (Wallace,2011). After independence from South Africa in 1990,when freemovement consolidated as a reality (past lawswere lifted in 1978) and urbanization accelerated, meet‐ing the housing needs of the dispossessed populationsbecame a policy priority. The first NHP in 1991 put astrong emphasis on addressing the backlog of housing.The revision of 2009 shifted to an overall understandingof housing as an engine of economic growth enabled bythe state. Since 1991, the Ministry of Urban and RuralDevelopment has supported different programs targetedat low‐income households, with different legacies andvarying degrees of success (see Table 2).Recent unpublished data by the Shack DwellersFederation of Namibia show that about half of theurban population lives in informal conditions withoutadequate services and tenure security (Scharrenbroich& Shuunyuni, 2022). In the 1990s, the realities of infor‐mal settlements were a new and emerging concern(Peyroux & Graefe, 1995). Scholar‐activists documentedthe heterogeneous forms of inhabitation whereby peopleappropriated the built environment in unexpected ways(Muller, 1993, 1995). When housing was delivered, peo‐ple adapted built structures in heterodox ways that fittheir social norms, daily needs, and a growing interest innew technologies (radio, kitchens). The national approachto the land question has been generally focused on landreform, understood as the redistribution of agriculturalland with no consideration of the production of formalland and housing in urban areas, although this changedin the Second National Land Conference of 2018 (Lühl &Delgado, 2018; see also Republic of Namibia, 2018).The 2009 revision of the NHP introduced a neo‐liberal ethos in housing policy (Delgado & Lühl, 2013).This further excluded the majority of the populationfrom housing as the assumption that people couldaccess housing finance did not hold for over 90% of thepopulation that in 2018 could not access a mortgage(Chiripanhura, 2018). These policies have pushed thegrowing urban population in Namibia to overcrowdedtownships—densified through building backyard struc‐tures, housing division, and extensions—and peri‐urbanneighborhoods, lacking adequate infrastructures, ser‐vices, and provision of access to livelihood opportunities.Colonialities are therefore reproduced in urban plan‐ning, with aspirations of formalization that deny theurban realities in the country and that assimilate housingneeds to heteropatriarchal models. Informal settlementsare often reduced to “a type” without specific needs.Some policy efforts have sought to recognize the dynam‐ics of change in informal developments. For example, theNational Land Policy of 1998 referred to the potential ofincremental development, and the First Housing Policy of1991 recognized the role of self‐help groups in housingUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 167Table 2.

Women‐led groups havefor decades advocated for community‐led incremen‐tal and co‐produced approaches (Chitekwe‐Biti, 2018).The scale of the housing challenge, estimated to require22,000 houses per year (Asino & Christensen, 2018),remains overwhelming. Efforts like those described inTable 2 have had too little impact to make a differ‐ence (Chiripanhura, 2018). The revised NHP will recog‐nize the agency of the state to create housing opportuni‐ties through land rights andbasic services andwill reintro‐duce co‐production approaches to housing. However, itsimpact on LGBTIQ+ people already facing social and insti‐tutional discrimination has not been examined in detail.2.3. Queer Lives and Housing in NamibiaWhile there are accounts of post‐independence actionby LGBTIQ+ groups (Lorway, 2014), engagement with his‐torical accounts of queerness is rare, except for colo‐nial accounts of “indigenous sexuality” (Falk, 1926/1998).Oshiwambo, a family of Bantu languages spoken by thelargest cultural group in Namibia, has a specific termto denote queer identities (singular, es(h)enge; plural,omas(h)enge), suggesting open acknowledgement andhistorical documentation of queer presence (Murray &Roscoe, 1998). However, missionization in the late 19thand early 20th centuries entrenched the idea of hetero‐sexual monogamy as the default form of organization(Miettinen, 2005). This was furthermore racialized, withinterracial relations outlawed during apartheid times, apractice that continued after the regulation on the mat‐ter was abolished in the late 1970s. The influence ofpatriarchal, racial, and heteronormative norms is stillpalpable today. The first administration after indepen‐dence lasted 15 years and was characterized by hate‐ful, homophobic speech, strongly shaping public viewsUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 168(see Currier, 2010). The following administration, whichlasted 10 years, created de facto tolerance by avoidingpronouncements. The current situation is one of increas‐ing social acceptance, with the development of a vibrantqueer cultural life, despite continuous displays of homo‐phobia in public life and bureaucratic administration(Brown, 2019).Activists and civil society organizations have increas‐ingly developed projects to advance LGBTIQ+ rights andsexual health. Gaining visibility became a major chal‐lenge for LGBTIQ+ movements (Currier, 2012). For exam‐ple, the Namibian Rainbow Project was founded in 1996in response to SWAPO’s hate speech. The NamibianRainbow Project pioneered a multi‐layered approachof actions to promote the rights of LGBTIQ+ commu‐nities, including advocacy, social services, and healthcampaigns. However, their work also became mired bycontradictions and their dependence on resources andideas from the West (Lorway, 2014). Recent protestsled by youth groups have taken a decolonial andintersectional approach, with the prominent inclusionof LGBTIQ+ issues, partly through the emergence ofnew decentralized and non‐institutionalized organiza‐tions like the Namibia Equal Rights Movement (Becker,2022). In Southern Africa, international efforts oftenfocused on health programs to address the horrors ofthe HIV/AIDS epidemic but left more fundamental ques‐tions about rights unaddressed (Tucker, 2020). Today’ssituation remains ambiguous. TheNamibian constitutionis not specific about LGBTIQ+ rights. Some of the law’scomponents are homophobic, sexist, and incompatiblewith the spirit of inclusion and human rights of inde‐pendent Namibia. Nevertheless, public views combine amixture of tolerance (or veiled avoidance) and conserva‐tive distance. Most people living in urban areas todayare reportedly indifferent to LGBTIQ+ people, as thelargest proportion of respondents in urban areas (54.5%)would like orwould notmind having a homosexual neigh‐bour (Afrobarometer, 2022). Institutional discriminationin governmental institutions, isolated instances of vio‐lence, hatred discourses sometimes disguised as harmfuljokes, job discrimination, and isolation are all common inNamibian society.In Namibia, the housing crisis presents existentialchallenges for LGBTIQ+ groups. LGBTIQ+ people reportfeelings of homelessness even when having a place tolive, which adds to other stress factors, including theneed to conform to gendered stereotypes and the threatof violence, often within one’s own family (Solomons,2020). Historically, housing and urban policies have ledto a further entrenchment of inequalities with the simul‐taneous repression of already colonized, racialized, andqueer identities. Namibian housing policy illustrates howforms of coloniality compound LGBTIQ+ discrimination.This is visible, for example, in housing designs, such asthe matchbox house model that provided the templatefor black township housing in Namibia (Nord, 2022a).Housing models were tied to prescriptions for habita‐tion that deserving individuals had to match, partic‐ularly concerning the adoption of Western lifestyles(Müller‐Friedman, 2008). For example, matchbox houseswere developed according to the assumed spatial needsof the (white) nuclear family and separated everydayactivities around spaces of sleeping, living, dining, andcooking, with assigned roles for individuals in the fam‐ily across those spaces; any “adaptations” to respondto black and “colored” residents resulted in lower build‐ing standards, lower‐quality materials, and reductionsin space available (Nord, 2022a). LGBTIQ+ people facedthe additional need to conform to the gender and sex‐ual roles prescribed in this form of habitation, seeingthem excluded from public spaces and community orga‐nizations if they did not conform. The reproduction ofLGBTIQ+ discrimination through the performance colo‐niality of practices—for example, in the activities of archi‐tects and urban planners (Nord, 2022a)—highlights thatneither can be considered in isolation. Instead, theyhave to be confronted with an explicitly queer decolo‐nial perspective.3. Perspectives on Housing From Queer Communities3.1. MethodologyThe objective of this research was to evaluate theNHP’s principles through the perspective of queer expe‐rience, as understood by those experiencing discrimina‐tion because they identify as queer. Walvis Bay is a portcity where queerness has found relatively welcominggrounds. A city composed of people from many placesaround the country, it is animated further with a flowof international workers and tourists and is remarkablymixed. As the only major port along the Namibian coast,the city had been South African territory since beforeGerman colonization. It remained a contested space,remaining South African territory until four years afterNamibia’s independence.Walvis Bay is one of the few places outsideWindhoek with the presence of support organizationsfor the LGBTIQ+ community. In Walvis Bay, we workedwith Mpower Community Trust to develop a commonresearch agenda on housing. Mpower Community Trustis an organization supporting the health of queer commu‐nities in informal settlements, which is also developinginterests in other aspects of queer life, such as housing.Exploratory interviews were conducted in July 2022with four keymembers of the queer community inWalvisBay and two planners interested in considering queerperspectives in urban planning. The interviews focusedon identifying unique aspects of the queer experienceof accessing housing and the significance of differentplaces. Field visits to specific locations followed eachinterview. The strategy for data capture was “visual har‐vesting,” creating drawings during the interviews andfollow‐up visits that were also shared with the inter‐viewees for feedback. The images were integrated toUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 169create a thematic representation of the issues, in aneffort to construct an initial research agenda (Figure 1).In November 2022, Mpower Community Trust organizedtwo workshops with members of the LGBTIQ+ commu‐nity in Walvis Bay. The first workshop brought together16 young adults, all black, living in the township ofKuisebmond, and open about their LGBTIQ+ identity.The second workshop included 16 queer activists rep‐resenting different LGBTIQ+ groups, from high‐incomewhite gay men to black trans activists and sex workers.Visual harvesting inputs were consolidated into a mapof salient issues (Figure 1) that informed the first partof the discussion during the workshop, seeking to gen‐erate shared research questions. During the second partof the workshop, participants drew and shared represen‐tations and understanding of ideal homes. The analysisdiscusses first, a synthesis of queer perceptions of hous‐ing and home in Walvis Bay, and second, an analysis ofthe spatial aspects of the integration of housing in theurban economy and the contradictions in the creation ofsafe spaces.3.2. Queer Perceptions of Housing and Home inWalvis BayFigure 1 presents a collectivemapping of the constitutionof queer relations around housing. The drawings illus‐trate the salient aspects of the interviews and establishunexpected connections. Stronger connections are high‐lighted with different colors. The diagram includes key‐words that interviewees or workshop participants high‐lighted, linking to their personal and other participants’accounts. The discussions clustered around four themes:the development of social relations, the availability ofsafe spaces, the redefinition of spaces of social reproduc‐tion, and the material and symbolic constitution of thecity as a place of living. These initial themes were thenexplored in a collective dialogue during the workshops.Social relations were mediated by both persistingforms of coloniality and the demands to engage in formsof decoloniality that contest them. Coloniality shapeseverything from the forms of communication—what lan‐guages are spoken and where—to the spatial inequal‐ities in access to housing, affordability, and services.Coloniality also highlights the dependence on commod‐ified engagements with different forms of inhabitation.At the same time, and particularly in relation to housing,there is a sense of the need to speak “a certain language”that provides access to housing to navigate the complexrequirements that enable people’s access. Many partic‐ipants requested information about how to access thegovernment’s housing programs and shared their strug‐gle to understand the processes involved in accessingthem. The difficulties in navigating the bureaucracies ofhousing programs generate a sense of missed opportu‐nity as if the responsibility for accessing housing restedonly on the capacity of individuals to qualify for mort‐gages. Participants in the secondworkshop discussed theact of going to the bank, how the background of differ‐ent people would condition their access to the bank, andhow they come across. These technical and bureaucraticlanguages are therefore related to the question of afford‐ability in a disabling environment that prevents ratherthan facilitates access to housing.Coloniality manifests physically in the structurationof space in unequal neighborhoods. Self‐constructionappears when people do not find housing alternatives,but this is only possible within less regulated spaceswithin the city, such as, for example, Kuisebmond.Selective segregation practices are reproduced, if not for‐mally, through the combined practices of multiple actorsin a disabling environment that excludes large popula‐tion groups from accessing housing. “The land speaks,”said some participants when trying to explain the inter‐section of social histories in Walvis Bay with the spatialand ecological histories that have co‐evolved with thembecause of the consolidation of patterns of inequality inurban space—from land ownership to the conditions inwhich land is accessed.In the context of limited affordability, commodifiedengagements shape individual relationships with thehome and the house. Either the house becomes anobject of value to be exchanged or it enables accessto other commodities, objects of special significancethat create meaning within queer lives (a private spaceto make some noise, a kitchen to develop one’s culi‐nary interests, a storage space to keep clothes or otheridentity‐related objects). These commodified engage‐ments may help develop further social and emotionalrelationships, for example, when delicious food becomesa shared object and a restaurant becomes a place ofencounter. Individuals use forms of consumption to rede‐fine their social relations, making them at home withintheir neighborhoods.This led the discussion to the complex aspects ofwhat constitutes a safe space and how it relates tonotions of home. Participants highlighted the impor‐tance of those physical meeting places, often multi‐purpose locales for civil society organizations, where dif‐ferent forms of expression are allowed. The MpowerCommunity Trust is located in such a facility, where theexpression of queer identity is supported and encour‐aged (our workshops included icebreakers and partici‐pants and facilitators shared personal stories).However, reducing the idea of “safe space” to spe‐cific locationswhere queer expression is allowednot onlyreduces queer experiences but also diminishes the possi‐bility of finding spaces of home in differentmoments andstages of life. Participants were also interested in consid‐ering how “home” can be constituted into a safe space(as it is not always a safe space). Participants emphasizedthe idea of “home as a person,” that is, home is not aphysical house but a safe space where relationships withloved ones can be developed. The person in questionvaries depending on queer experiences. Some individu‐als found themselves linking home ideas to a person theyUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 170Figure 1.Mapping of housing relations for queer populations. Figure drawn by Erika Conchis, based on designs by TakudzwaMukesi and collective discussions.had grownupwith, sometimes their parents, other timesa person who provided refuge, such as an auntie or aneighbour. Other individuals tied the home to the peo‐ple they had to provide for, such as their children, sib‐lings, or friends. Whether provided to oneself or others,ideas of care were central to constituting the home as asafe space.In the workshops, the home as a safe space was pre‐sented as a place of acceptance. In a society that stillcriminalizes non‐conforming sexualities—evenwhen theauthorities do not enforce the legislation—acceptancerepresents the recognition of one’s existence as valid bythose closest to that person. The home is thus a spacewhere anyone can express themselves through musicand noise and through loving relationships with thosewho make the home. Human relationships thus consti‐tute the safe spaces that queer people can inhabit asa home.Individuals can also feel at home in public spaces.Queer lives in Walvis Bay extend beyond the home.People expressed their need to feel part of a commu‐nity and to experience acceptance beyond a reducedcircle of acquaintances. Moreover, they explained howcommunity support could make a difference to queerpeople to feel at home in their neighbourhoods. Manyshared endearing stories about how neighbours sup‐ported street kids and the kinds of support received,for example, through HIV‐support groups or sex workers’associations. The need for spaces for “mental refresh‐ment” highlighted that the material constitution of pub‐lic or collective space is also important. The lagoon, inparticular, constituted a common spacewithwhichmanyparticipants identified.Safe spaces of homemaking stand side‐by‐side withthe processes that constitute the unequal city as a livedspace. The city also has housing policies and municipalregulations, which impose a formalizing language on theurban fabric. Recently, the constitution of aesthetic com‐mittees in certain areas and the implementation of townplanning reproduce modernist ideas about how WalvisBay should be inhabited. These formal regulations repro‐duce housing models that further entrench the histori‐cally produced spatial inequalities observable in the citytoday. Isolation of architectural practices from the actualliving conditions in Walvis Bay further entrenches inade‐quate practices. The housing stock in lower‐income areasremains unaffordable, and many houses—none benefit‐ting from architectural design quality—appear empty.The desire for house and land ownership is notexclusive to queer people. However, our discussionsUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 171suggested that, for queer communities, it is stronglylinked to a sense of safety and better living conditions,especially in townships such as Kuisebmond. The beliefthat “owning” a house is a key to safety and well‐beingrests on the assumption that owning a house is aneffective means to securitize space. However, for someworkshop participants, home ownership was linked to adesire for sharing and building collectives around a par‐ticular space. Several participants emphasized the con‐stitution of their dream home as a collective space ofencounter. This is particularly important in the contextof “the ghetto,” the term people use in Namibia to referto townships such as Kuisebmond, especially when theylack services and livelihood opportunities. While manyideal home representations were presented as escapismfrom the ghetto, some participants drew their houseswithin that space and argued that “you can also live instyle in the ghetto.” One young activist wrote the slo‐gan “mi casa es su casa” to emphasize that their idealof a home is a house in the ghetto that provides a homefor everyone.At the same time, the representation of the houseas a closed, private space also relates to what countsas family. Several participants highlighted the meaningof objects with sentimental value that brought back thefigures of specific people who constituted the home,such as a grandparent or a distant relative. Those mate‐rial engagements may redefine the figure of the fam‐ily around an extended, multi‐headed, and uniform setof familiar relations within which queer people can findsafe spaces and feel at home. The appropriation of hous‐ing space through squatting and self‐built housing areresponses that challenge the dynamic of speculation andhelp reimagine a more inclusive city.3.3. Spatialization of Queer Housing NeedsThe establishment of the home as a unit of social rela‐tions translates into specific forms of individual regu‐lation, from moral prescriptions to behavior expecta‐tions. Home is where social relations of family and trustare forged, which most often happens through con‐sumption. For example, individuals explained how theyforge relationships through performing chores togetheror sharing food or drinks. Such accounts, however, implypurchasing power and consumption of goods. We alsofound non‐commodified accounts where queer peoplereported forging relationships with community mem‐bers who supported their well‐being. For the former,schools, extracurricular activities, and churches wereplaces where individuals felt part of a group even whenthey knew their sexual orientation would represent aproblem for some members. For the latter, the water‐front in thewealthier areaswas reportedly a placewhereone could go for a walk or run without being disturbedor worried about safety issues.Queer populations change the constitution of spaceacross the city. Higher‐income areas are generally consid‐ered low‐density, comprising larger plots and larger prop‐erties. However, some have used planning provisions tobuild backyard structures for rent, originally envisionedas “granny flats” or service quarters. Another strategy isthe establishment of guesthouses,whichwould, in effect,be medium to long‐term rentals. This is due to the press‐ing need for housing and income pressures, even in tra‐ditionally higher‐income areas.At the same time, home is not always a safe space.Several young participants in the first workshop empha‐sized the importance of privacy and space to be them‐selves, for example, by playing loudmusic or being alone.The home and the house are the chief “safe space” inan aggressive urban environment as it enables a cer‐tain degree of isolation. At the same time, some sharedspaces can constitute a place of safety. Some individ‐uals suggested that a recently built shopping mall wasa place of safety and an option for safe recreation.Themall absorbedmany businesses that were otherwisedistributedwithin the city’s central areas, and queer peo‐ple felt safe enough to participate.Interviewees and workshop participants reportedplaces that felt like home but did not match the assump‐tions about the home and were in no way conforming tonormative ideas of the home. Often, home referred todifferent collectivities and their operation in safeguard‐ing queer lives. For example, one respondent explainedhow their safety was reinforced by seeing how the neigh‐bours cared for other vulnerablemembers, such as streetkids. According to this account, some families within theneighbourhood, including the grandparents of the inter‐viewee, organize provisions for street kids. As explainedabove, extended families play a central role in contempo‐rary life in Namibia.At the same time, the private house plays an essen‐tial role in facilitating access to services. For example,Mpower Community Trust shares space within a munic‐ipally owned building that provides a haven for queermen. The place has a vibrant life, busy with activitiesand formal and informal interaction as the MpowerCommunity Trust facilitates social events for itsmembersto interact. However, some targeted services, such as sex‐ual and mental health support, happen in private homesrather than in a municipal‐owned building and are notsponsored but open for voluntary contributions.The home, and the house, become sites for urbanreproduction, where the future is constituted around themythical ideal of the family. The experience of queerpopulations, however, redefines the idea of the home(individual and collective, permanent and transitory, safeand unsafe) and the idea of the family. Affective linkagesbetween home and family are also strong among queerindividuals. One participant emphasized that his grand‐father had built the house where they lived. The grand‐father’s labor in procuring it conferred the house addi‐tional value. Much of the potentialities of queer housingemerge from chaotic structures of housing. For exam‐ple, a respondent described their house as a collectiveUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 172housing unit without basic services like water or electric‐ity. The house hosted several individuals identifying asqueer, among other non‐queer members and children.“Family” included several individuals who regularly werefound at the house. However, no one could or wanted toprovide an account of who lived there and explained thatsome forms of inhabitation were sporadic and transitory.The space is fully occupied, and places that appeared tobe living rooms or kitchens are now used as bedrooms.Inhabitants believe a prominent professional owns theplace in Windhoek, and those living there are, in effect,occupying the space without paying rent outside realestate market dynamics.Few of these accounts, however, engaged with theracialized character of queer living even though racialsegregation is a constant in everyday life. A plannerexplained that race, rather than income, distributed peo‐ple around the city, withwealthier black people choosingto live in lower‐income Kuisebmond, to avoid everydayfriction with white people in higher‐income areas.4. ConclusionExploring the question of housing in Namibia from aqueer perspective exposes the roots of homophobicheteropatriarchal assumptions informing housing andhow they have coevolved with different forms of colo‐niality that are still reproduced in more or less formal‐ized assumptions about urban planning and housingpolicy. Queer decolonial thought simultaneously chal‐lenges (a) the forms of coloniality that endure in thecountry and become sedimented in spatial patterns ofinequality and (b) the assumptions about affective rela‐tions, identity, and personal life associated with suchforms of coloniality.The exploratory study of the perceptions of hous‐ing among different LGBTIQ+ groups in Walvis Bay raisesquestions that help interrogate and develop currenthousing policy. First, there are questions about the repro‐duction of forms of racial segregation and how they inter‐act with the forms of exclusion from housing faced byLGBTIQ+ people. If “Namibia’s fraught history of seg‐regation remains the phantom that haunts contempo‐rary urban spaces” (Tjirera, 2021, p. 71), this phan‐tom relates closely to the imposition of heteropatriar‐chal modes of living (Delgado, 2021). What we observetoday in the city are strategies of “making space” by dif‐ferent people, including the LGBTIQ+ populations, thatassimilate some of those strategies to finding a placein the city. Collective identity offers additional forms ofbelonging to LGBTIQ+ people who see themselves assharing a common problem and mobilize mutual sup‐port strategies. However, the constitution of safe spacesis not straightforward, as it requires both collectiveand private sites, in messy arrangements which are notalways sanitized. Still today, the uncritical acceptance ofmodernist planning principles contributes to reproduc‐ing formal and informal mechanisms of discrimination(Müller‐Friedman, 2008; Nord, 2022a). What is less rec‐ognized, however, is that LGBITIQ+ populations face addi‐tional layers of exclusion and may not be able to accessadditionalmechanisms to palliate those forms of discrim‐ination (Delgado, 2021).One salient finding from the workshops is that formembers of the LGBTIQ+ community in Walvis Bay—within and beyond Kuisebmond—is that social‐affectiverelations are the most critical component of the makingof a safe home. Here two factors play a role. On the onehand, there is a question of what belonging means indifferent contexts. For example, what constitutes a fam‐ily and a community? Multi‐generational, extended fam‐ilies are now the norm in townships such as Kuisefmond(Nord, 2022b). The home and the house are appropri‐ated as places of social reproduction where new formsof interaction come into being. Forms of coloniality andcolonial imposition perdure, but they are reappropri‐ated and incorporated into the specific spaces of queerlives. How do new ways of performing belonging shapeLGBTIQ+ possibilities to access housing?On the other hand, how different queer identi‐ties are performed and how they are distributed inspace raises questions about what constitutes citizen‐ship in contemporary Namibia. Housing policy mustattend to the heterogeneous range of collective andprivate spaces that enable the expression of affectivelives. The distinction between public and private, collec‐tive and individual, and shared and commoditized mud‐dles rather than clarifies the multiple overlapping mech‐anismswhereby LGBTIQ+ groups inWalvis Bay constitutepublic spaces where private identities can be expressedand private spaces that enable publicly shared lives.Safety is not achieved through isolation but throughconnections. These include social, affective, and mate‐rial connections whose nature is often indistinguishable.Housing policy needs to promote rather than dissolvethose connections.Queer decolonial thought has thus three implica‐tions for an agenda of research on housing in Namibia.First, it calls for understanding what community andbelonging mean for LGBTIQ+ people. As the revisedNHP puts forward co‐production and community devel‐opment as critical strategies for housing delivery, itwill need to acknowledge how those communities oper‐ate and whom they can reach. The NHP must provideopportunities for multiple forms of social organization tounfold in the city, for example, the growing prevalence ofextended andmulti‐generational families. Second, queerdecolonial thought poses questions about citizenship,particularly with the shift to a view of the state’s rolein housing and the need to identify the multiple waysthe state misrecognizes individuals who do not conformto prescribed identities and sexual orientations. Third,queer decolonial thought invites reflection on the consti‐tution of safe spaces in aggressive urban environmentsand the multiple layers of perceived safety constructedthrough diverse institutions and public spaces. HousingUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 164–176 173policy needs to be integrated with broader perspectivesconsidering the nature of shared spaces and their some‐times chaotic and transitory nature.Queer utopian thought, however, goes beyond hous‐ing policy focused on housing provision because itemphasizes the need to secure solidarity spaces withinexisting possibilities. Home dreams intersect with pasthistories and imagined futures and connect individualswith wider communities. Changes in people and placesdepend on how people and things interact. The cityconstitutes a broader kind of home, as it increasinglyhosts places of meaningful interaction that help socialbonding and the constitution of safe spaces, includingschools, churches, public spaces, shopping malls, bars,and community centers. In practice, informal housing—living spaces without services—become safe spaces withdifferent degrees of performance for those who cannotaccess formal housing opportunities. The very presenceof queer individuals in places primarily catering to cis‐gendered, heterosexual clientele may already be a sub‐versive act.AcknowledgmentsThe team would like to thank the MPower CommunityTrust for their support in implementing the workshopsin Walvis Bay and for their ongoing work.

    "abstract": "Heteronormative models of the home have permeated housing policies for decades, only adding to economic and spatial inequalities in a landscape of housing injustices. Half of the urban population in Namibia lives in precarious housing conditions. Cities like Windhoek and Walvis Bay are among the most unequal in the world. Such inequalities translate into significant gaps in housing quality, security, and service provision. These inequalities are acutely felt by LGBTIQ+ populations that already face other forms of exclusion from economic and social life and fundamental human rights. A new National Housing Policy - emphasizing the right to housing - is about to be adopted in Namibia, but would it address the concerns of queer populations? This article asks what it means to engage with Namibia’s new National Housing Policy through the lens of queer decolonial thought. It presents an exploratory study of the questions emerging at the margins of the discussion on the National Housing Policy. The objective was to develop an exploratory research agenda for a queer decolonial perspective on housing in Namibia. In the context of enormous housing shortages, a queer decolonial perspective emphasizes radical inclusion as a principle for housing provision. The exploration of shared queer experiences in accessing housing suggests that the themes of belonging, identity, and safety may support the development of such an agenda. Queer decolonial thought has thus three implications for an agenda of research on housing in Namibia. First, it calls for understanding what community and belonging mean for LGBTIQ+ people. Second, queer decolonial thought poses questions about citizenship, particularly given the shift to a view of the state as creating housing opportunities (through land rights and basic services) and support mechanisms for incremental housing. Queer decolonial thought calls for identifying the multiple ways the state misrecognizes individuals who do not conform to prescribed identities and sexual orientations. Third, queer decolonial thought invites reflection on the constitution of safe spaces in aggressive urban environments and the multiple layers of perceived safety constructed through diverse institutions and public spaces",
