Hunter*INTRODUCTIONThe argument that laws that discriminate on the basis of sexualorientation in fact discriminate on the basis of sex is not new.Advocates have been pressing this claim for almost thirty years.Simply put, the argument is that a statute that bars a sexualrelationship between two women or two men discriminates on thebasis of sex because either partner could have had the samerelationship with a person of the opposite sex.The beginning was not auspicious for the sex discriminationargument. Courts considering challenges in the 1970s to marriagelaws concluded, with very little need for discussion, that marriagewas definitionally an institution involving only male-femalecouples, and that therefore even a state Equal Rights Amendmentcould not undo the prohibition on same-sex marriage.' Similarly,courts hearing employment discrimination cases easily concludedthat sex discrimination meant discrimination against women oroccasionally against men, but not anti-gay discrimination.2That easy dismissal of the sex discrimination argument hasbegun to erode. The first judicial adoption of this argument camein 1993 in Baehr v. Lewin, in which the Hawaii Supreme Court* Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School.

Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 569 F.2d 325 (5th Cir. 1978).398 JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICYheld that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples did constitutea prima facie case of violating that state's Equal Rights Amend-ment.3 In 1999, it was taken up and expanded by Justice Johnsonas part of the basis for her concurrence in Baker v. Vermont,holding that the Vermont marriage statute violated that state'sconstitution.4 Most recently, the Texas Court of Appeals invalidat-ed a same-sex sodomy statute on that ground as well.'The sex discrimination argument has also begun to gain tractionin sexual orientation cases arising under statutes. The SupremeCourt has ruled that same-sex harassment claims are justiciableunder Title VII,6 in response to same-sex sexual harassmentcomplainants who have sought to frame the allegedly unlawfulconduct as sex discrimination, either rather than or in addition tosexual orientation discrimination.7 Similarly, under Title IX, same-sex harassment has been recognized as a subset of sex discrimina-tion.8 For example, the Wisconsin state anti-discrimination statute' 852 P.2d 44, 81-82 (Haw.), recons. granted in part, 875 P.2d 225 (Haw.1993).4 744 A.2d 864, 898 (Vt. 1999) (Johnson, J., concurring).'

REV. 1 (1995).. 399JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICYfor sex discrimination law of using that claim in sexual orientationcases, with the prominent exception of Sylvia Law, who wrote thefirst major article on the topic. 3 I want to initiate discussion ofthe possible reverberations for feminist law, as well as for lesbian,gay, bisexual and transgender (\"LGBT\") rights law.I am going to discuss these cases in terms of the leadingparadigms of sex discrimination law. Because I want to focus onconstitutional concepts of equality, my most frequent example willbe marriage law, where the argument has been most fully devel-oped. I am not going to address claims arising under anti-discrimi-nation statutes, such as the harassment cases.My beginning point will be the two primary conceptualizationsof sex discrimination: formal equality theory and anti-subordinationtheory. 14 Both of these theoretical approaches have been invokedin the scholarship concerning the use of sex discriminationarguments in LGBT cases, and either is sufficient to sustain afinding that sex discrimination exists. In turn, such rulings inLGBT rights cases are likely to have a significant impact onunderstandings of how law operates to subordinate women.Ultimately, though, I am going to argue that neither approachis culturally sufficient to meet the objections of those who assertthat the sex discrimination argument is a doctrinal sleight of handwhen used to challenge sexual orientation discrimination. To fullyanswer those objections, one must address the issues that arise inthe context of what I will call definition theory. Definition theoryis the most provocative of the approaches to these overlappingareas. Because of its provocative nature, definition theory is theleast useful in litigation, but also the most powerful in its potentialcultural impact.\"3 Sylvia A. Law, Homosexuality and the Social Meaning of Gender, 1988WIS. L. REV. 187 (1988).\" See Kathryn Abrams, The Constitution of Women, 48 ALA. L. REV. 861(1997). For simplicity's sake, I am combining two of Abrams' categories -difference theory and dominance theory - into anti-subordination theory.400GAY RIGHTS CASESI. FORMAL EQUALITY THEORYFormal equality is considered the old, boring version of civilrights law. Critics have attacked it for its superficiality andformalism; 5 and despite its usefulness in removing explicit legalbarriers for women, it is rarely described positively in feministscholarship.' 6 In fact, claims of sex discrimination in gay rightscases may be the only realm in which formal equality theory stillhas any real intellectual kick.For an analysis of using sex discrimination arguments in gayrights cases, the starting point for formal equality claims is Lovingv. Virginia, 7 the case which held that anti-miscegenation lawswere unconstitutional. In Loving, the Court ruled that lawsprohibiting intermarriage violated the Equal Protection Clausebecause they were based on a racial classification. This, the Courtsaid, was per se impermissible - absent a compelling state interest- even if the law operated to bar certain acts both for whites andfor persons of color.In gay marriage cases, courts adopting a formal equalityanalysis substitute the word \"sex\" for the word \"race\" in a criticalpassage from Loving, so that, rewritten, it becomes:\"5 See, e.g., Sylvia A. Law, Rethinking Sex and the Constitution, 132 U. PA.L. REV. 955 (1984); Christine A. Littleton, Reconstructing Sexual Equality, 75CAL. L. REv. 1279 (1987).16 For a rare endorsement, see Mary Anne Case, \"The Very Stereotype theLaw Condemns\": Constitutional Sex Discrimination Law as a Quest for PerfectProxies, 85 CORNELL L. REv. 1447 (2000) (proposing that formal equality, oranti-differentiation, is an attractive principle, even though it is less fashionabletoday than the alternate anti-subordination principle, because formal equality doesnot lead to the separate-but-equal thinking that results from applying the anti-subordination principle, as evidenced by Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurringopinion in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 565 (1996)). A similardisjuncture between equality theories that are successful in litigation and thosemost favored by scholars occurs in LGBT cases between arguments grounded inmore individualist notions of rights and those proceeding from a group rightsapproach.

L.J. 867,870 (2000).17 388 U.S. 1 (1967).JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICY[W]e reject the notion that the mere 'equal application' ofa statute containing [sex] classifications is enough toremove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amend-ment's proscriptions of all invidious discrimination. . . . Inthe case at bar, ... we deal with statutes containing [sex]classifications, and the fact of equal application does notimmunize the statute from the very heavy burden ofjustification which the Fourteenth Amendment has tradi-tionally required of state statutes drawn according to[sex]. 18Thus by analogy, Loving stands for the proposition that but for thepartner's sex, the individual could marry her or him. The samemove leads to a similar conclusion as the discriminatory impact ofcriminal laws that prohibit sodomy only between same sexpartners: \"the distinction between legal and illegal conduct [is] notthe act, but rather the sex of one of the participants.\"19 On thisunderstanding, the sex-based classification per se is the equalityviolation.This theory of equality formed the basis for the HawaiiSupreme Court's ruling that the marriage law amounted todiscrimination based on sex\"° and for the invalidation of the Texasstate sodomy law by the Texas Court of Appeals. 2' Yet there havealways been two problems lurking in the heart of formal equalitydoctrine about sex. They both manifest themselves in the sexualorientation cases generally and the marriage cases specifically.The first major problem for formal equality doctrine arises ifthe two groups in question are not considered similarly situated.For men and women, the argument has always been that commen-surability is lacking because of biological difference. In the early1970s, faced with the argument that \"natural\" differences justifieda wide range of barriers to women, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, thenhead of the ACLU Women's Rights Project, flipped the meaning of18 Id. at 8.'9 Lawrence v. Texas, No. 14-99-00109-CR, 2000 WL 729417, *3 (Tex.App., June 8, 2000).20 Baehr v.

Reed22 andFrontiero v. Richardson.23 She argued that the immutability of thesex characteristic and the individual's lack of control over it madeusing it to justify inferior treatment all the more invidious andunfair.24 Ginsburg \"had effectively taken what had previouslybeen the greatest weakness of equal protection arguments againstsex-based classifications and made it the center of the case. 25Ginsburg's move was a masterful litigation stroke, but it alsoleft unchallenged - indeed, it strengthened - the link betweensexual difference and biology. Her argument forced the Court toexamine more closely the legal barriers to individual women whosought the opportunity to disprove a generalization based on theirfemale status, but left open the continued reliance on biologicalnorms in cases involving sex and reproduction, arenas whereseemingly no woman could escape the \"rule\" of nature, at least asthe courts interpreted that rule.2622 404 U.S. 71 (1971).23 411 U.S. 677 (1973).24 See, e.g., Brief for Appellant, at 5, Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971) (No.70-430). Ginsburg began her appeal with an argument that sex, like race,deserved \"suspect classification\" status because sex and race shared many of thesame characteristics:Although the legislature may distinguish between individuals on thebasis of their need or ability, it is presumptively impermissible todistinguish on the basis of an unalterable identifying trait over whichthe individual has no control and for which he or she should not bedisadvantaged by the law. Legislative discrimination grounded on sex,for purposes unrelated to any biological difference between the sexes,ranks with legislative discrimination based on race, another congenital,unalterable trait of birth, and merits no greater judicial deference.Id.25 Donald Braman, Of Race and Immutability, 46 UCLA. L. REv. 1375,1453 (1999).26 See Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County, 450 U.S. 464, 469(1981) (holding that as long as the rule of nature that the sexes are not similarlysituated in certain circumstances is realistically reflected in a gender classifica-tion, the statute will be upheld as constitutional; here, a California statutory rapelaw was found constitutional because the gender classification realisticallyreflected that females bear all of the risk of pregnancy); Geduldig v. Aiello, 417U.S. 484, 494-95 (1974) (holding that the rule of nature that women, unlike men,403JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICYThe manipulability'of biology-based arguments is evident in theopposite uses, depending on outcome, to which they can be put. Inwomen's rights cases, courts have justified different treatment basedon a finding of \"real\" difference, most often involving pregnancy.In the gay marriage cases, courts have justified different treatmentbecause of the absence of biological difference, on the theory thatthe institution of marriage requires difference.27 In other words,the biological difference between sexes has been invoked to createan exemption from the equality mandate in pregnancy cases and aprerequisite for it in gay marriage cases.Judicial reliance on (what judges perceive as) biology reflectsand reinscribes a deep naturalization of gender. Thus, when courtslike the Hawaii Supreme Court reject the argument that marriageis necessarily only male-female, they are undermining the kind ofessentialism that has been most harmful to women. Even simpleformal equality claims in gay marriage cases can provide apowerful lift out of some of the essentialist boxes used to holdback women, because they interrogate deeply embedded notions ofgender.One can see the dynamics of the naturalization of gender in thetext of now Justice Ginsburg's opinion in the VMI case:are susceptible to the risk of disability resulting from normal pregnancy does notrequire a state disability insurance program to cover this condition because theEqual Protection Clause does not require a state to choose between attackingevery risk of disability versus not attacking disability problems at all); see alsoWendy Williams, Equality's Riddle: Pregnancy and the Equal Treatment/SpecialTreatment Debate, 13 N.Y.U. REv. L. & SOC. CHANGE 325 (1985). ThePregnancy Discrimination Act established protection for pregnant women in therealm of employment, but not, for example, in family law or criminal law. 42U.S.C. § 2000e(k) (2000). Thus, Geduldig is still good law as an interpretationof the Constitution. Even the Pregnancy Discrimination Act has not alwaysproven reliable in eliminating differential treatment of pregnant women. See, e.g.,Chambers v. Omaha Girls Club, Inc., 834 F.2d 697 (8th Cir. 1987). But see Int'lUnion, UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187 (1991).The Court's most recent engagement with the constitutionality of apregnancy-linked classification ended inconclusively, when the Court found nostanding for the party challenging an immigration law that treated children bornto unmarried parents differently depending on whether the father or mother wasa U.S. citizen. Miller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420 (1998).27 See, e.g., Baehr, 852 P.2d at 69 (Bums, J., concurring).404GAY RIGHTS CASESSupposed 'inherent differences' are no longer accepted asa ground for race or national origin classification [citingLoving]... Physical differences between men and women,however, are enduring... 'Inherent differences' betweenmen and women, we have come to appreciate, remaincause for celebration, but not for denigration of themembers of either sex or for artificial constraints on anindividual's opportunity.28The text of this passage moves from \"inherent differences\" as adiscredited basis for certain classifications, to \"physical differences\"between the sexes, and back to \"inherent differences., 29 Are thetwo terms synonymous? Is this a sly way to exclude psychologicaldifferences from the final phrase, which was largely the basis forVMI's argument that women were naturally unfit to be cadets at aco-education facility?30 Exactly which differences are we tocelebrate? Is this a euphemism for heterosexuality? For femalebonding? Doesn't the last sentence incorporate two contradictoryprinciples: that these inherent differences, as contrasted to racialones, are proper grounds for classification - but not for \"artificial\"constraints on an individual?Indeed, the Loving analogy helps to obscure that contradiction,since it is based on an analogy to race, the realm where indisput-ably there is no place for a separate but equal doctrine. The Court'sdecision in Loving signaled that the repudiation of separate butequal, which the court began in Brown v. Board of Education,3'was complete. That consensus has not formed as to gender, as towhich there is still substantial support for separate institutions. Forgender, unlike race, the cultural orthodoxy is difference. What28 United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996).29 Id.30 See United States v. Virginia, 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1432-35 (W.D.

Same-sexmarriage cuts to the heart of that naturalization in a very powerfuland visible way.12 Recognition of same-sex marriage would callinto question the law in women's rights cases, which have turnedon an acceptance of the inevitability of sex roles in sex. Often suchcases have permitted the differential treatment of pregnancy, or ofwomen because of the possibility of pregnancy. 33 Althoughheterosexual couples can reject sex roles in sex, the plausibility thatsuch rejection occurs is more socially visible when same-sexcouples are involved. Nonetheless, the potential is that acceptanceof same-sex marriage would strengthen the consciousness in casesinvolving heterosexual women that such roles are not inevitableand ordained by nature.II. ANTI-SUBORDINATION THEORYThe second problem with the formal equality model is that itignores power. Discrimination against men really is not the sameevil as discrimination against women, and one would say the sameas to \"reverse discrimination\" against whites, for example. In bothexamples, the core of the problem is not the absence of abstractequality but the presence of subordinating systems of power.34Anti-subordination theory speaks to this: sex discrimination notonly classifies, it subordinates a class.This concept of dominance has been the focus of almost all ofthe scholarship and almost none of the judicial decisions in the gayrights cases where plaintiffs have asserted a sex discrimination32 1 developed this argument in Nan D. Hunter, Marriage, Law and Gender:A Feminist Inquiry, 1 LAW & SEXUALITY 9 (1991).33 See supra note 26 (discussing pregnancy in the sex discriminationcontext).34 See Ruth Colker, Anti-Subordination Above All: Sex, Race and EqualProtection, 61 N.Y.U. L. REv. 1003 (1986) (arguing that, compared to the anti-differentiation perspective, anti-subordination better explains much of the equalprotection doctrine's history and case law, as well as the aversion felt toward raceand sex discrimination).406GAY RIGHTS CASESclaim. First Sylvia Law35 and then Andrew Koppelman 36 articu-lated the argument that anti-gay discrimination subordinates womenby its reinforcement of gender normative stereotypes about propermale and female behavior. Koppelman's article specificallyanswered the argument that reliance on the surface level analogyto Loving is insufficient because the Court there did not rely simplyon the law's creation of a racial distinction; it held that thedistinction did not in fact apply equally to all races, but was framedto enforce a code of white supremacist preservation of a \"superior\"race.37 Koppelman argued that a similar enforcement of malesupremacy lay behind the prohibition of homosexuality.38 Nojudge has taken up that argument as part of the analysis of a gayrights case, but Justice Johnson's opinion in Baker v. Vermontprovides a suggestive first step. 9The standard example in a formal equality approach of how thesex discrimination argument operates is that a court imagines twopersons of the same sex; let us call them Thelma and Louise.Either can marry a man, but neither can marry the other. Becauseneither wants to marry a man and they are barred from marryingeach other, they suffer discrimination based on the sex of theirpartner.4 °Justice Johnson used a version of this standard story, but onewhich can be read to illustrate a subtle but significant shift in thenarrative. As Justice Johnson framed the example, Dr. A and Dr.B both want to marry Ms. C. Dr. A is male; Dr. B is female. \"Thestatute disqualifies Dr. B from marriage solely on the basis of her35 Law, supra note 13.36 Koppelman, supra note 12; see also, J.M. Balkin, The Constitution ofStatus, 106 YALE L. J. 2313, 2361-64 (1997).3' Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967); see also Koppelman, supranote 12, at 222-26.38 Koppelman, supra note 12, at 234-57.3' Baker v. Vermont, 744 A.2d 864, 898 (Vt. 1999) (Johnson, J., concur-ring).4 See, e.g., Cass R. Sunstein, Homosexuality and the Constitution, 70 IND.L.J. 1, 18 (1994) (discussing how the courts have viewed bans on same-sexmarriage as sexual orientation discrimination, and not sex discrimination).407JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICYsex and treats her differently from Dr. A, a man. This is sexdiscrimination.'What is slightly different about this framing is that there is athird person in the imaginary construct, Ms. C, who is presumablychoosing between Dr. A and Dr. B. This scenario has a differentresonance than the more familiar story of two women who aresimply excluded from the institution of marriage. In my reading ofJustice Johnson's version, the social force of law is not simply toexclude based on sexual orientation or to penalize Dr. B., but toproduce heterosexuality. One imagines that Ms. C could go eitherway. If she wants to marry, however, she must choose Dr. A.Implicit in the example is that the harm is in the social coercion ofMs. C and in the forcible imposition of heteronormativity.42Justice Johnson sees the limitation to opposite-sex marriage asa vestige of the \"sex-role stereotyping\" that pervaded marriage lawprior to feminist legal reforms, citing enforced economic dependen-cy and the treatment of married women as legal incompetents asexamples.43 Again, one can see the point as not merely discrimi-natory treatment, but the role of the law of marriage as a majorengine of coercion for almost all women. Under an anti-subordina-tion theory as well as a formal equality theory, one can trace aclear link between how classifications based on sex have producedsocial regulation of women as well as of non-heterosexuals.To some extent, this link appears self-evident in everyday life.We all know that eliminating discriminatory laws opens up new4\" Baker, 744 A.2d at 906.42 See Jed Rubenfeld, The Right of Privacy, 102 HARV. L. REV. 737, 800(1989).13 Baker, 744 A.2d at 908 (Johnson, J., concurring). Justice Johnson offerednumerous examples of a woman's dependence on her husband:Under the common law, husband and wife were one person. The legalexistence of a woman was suspended by marriage; she merged withher husband and held no separate rights to enter into a contract orexecute a deed. She could not sue without her husband's consent or besued without joining her husband as a defendant. Moreover, if awoman did not hold property for her \"sole and separate use\" prior tomarriage, the husband received a freehold interest in all her property,entitling him to all the rents and profits from the property.Id. (citations omitted).408GAY RIGHTS CASESlife possibilities and creates subtle shifts in perception. Changes inthe popular language of marriage mark that evolution: from thetraditional terms of \"husband and wife\" - or even, \"man and wife\"- that once were universal; to the now common gender neutralword, \"spouses;\" to the increasingly widespread use of the termthat originated with lesbian and gay couples, \"partners.\"Nonetheless, there is much resistance to the full elaboration ofthe gender discrimination argument. If anti-gay discrimination is soharmful to women, for example, one might ask why more women'srights organizations have not been highlighting this argument. Allof the feminist organizations support a right to gay marriage, andmany have played supportive roles in the litigation.' But one hasno sense that anyone, including them, feels like this is theirargument. Granted, any claim is more radical when it toucheshomosexuality, but many sex discrimination cases involve gendernormative stereotypes. Is there a reason beyond political hesitancythat this argument has so much difficulty acquiring traction on theground?To many people, including many feminists, the sex discrimina-tion argument in gay rights cases seems too clever by half. Forsome, that is because it seems to be a dodge around what theysense is really going on, which is the subordination of homosexual-ity.45 For many married women, it apparently is highly implausi-ble to believe that legalizing same-sex marriage will have anyimpact on opposite-sex marriage. Among my straight womenstudents, for example, most support gay marriage out of a sense ofsolidarity with another oppressed group.

Vermont, 744 A.2d 864 (Vt. 1999).4' This is the argument made from the opposite policy perspective by thedissenting judge in Lawrence. Lawrence v. Texas, No. 14-99-00109-CR, 2000WL 729417, *5 (Tex. App., June 8, 2000) (Hudson, J., dissenting). \"Although[complainants] have attempted to frame their challenge ... in terms of genderdiscrimination, their true ground for complaint is that the statute criminalizescertain homosexual conduct that, in a heterosexual setting, would be perfectlylegal.\" Id. at 7.409JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICYpurely altruistic position. They appear to have no sense that it willdo anything for them.Critics argue that the exclusion of same-sex couples frommarriage does not harm women as a class, but gay people as aclass. Bill Eskridge points out that the same argument could havebeen made for anti-miscegenation laws.46 Those laws had a directeffect only on the mixed-race couples who wanted to marry, not onall African-Americans. Furtherance of the white supremacistideology that the laws embodied was an indirect effect. Eskridgeultimately returns to the Koppelman thesis, arguing that dominancetheory works if the subordination is indirect as well as direct. 7Edward Stein has responded to Eskridge and others, assertingthat the sex discrimination argument is sociologically, theoreticallyand morally mistaken. 48 Stein asserts that relying on a sex dis-crimination theory in a gay marriage case is to ignore the primarybasis for the discrimination: homophobia. He analogizes it to a sexdiscrimination challenge to anti-miscegenation laws, which couldbe premised on the understanding that \"a significant purpose ofsuch laws was to protect white women from black men,\" but whichwould misidentify the disadvantaged class (by asserting that it waswomen) and the belief system underlying the law (by focusing onsexism rather than racism). 49There is, however, a crucial distinction between using a sexdiscrimination argument in the anti-miscegenation cases and usingone in the gay marriage cases. The statute at issue in Lovingexplicitly discriminated based on race. Although I would agree withStein that sex and race are deeply interconnected in U. S. culture,the law on its face did not draw a sex-based distinction. It couldhave; a legislature could have chosen to specify differentialpenalties when an inter-racial marriage involved black men and46 WILLIAM N.

Although that might have been thedeepest fear of white legislators, they did not incorporate thatdistinction into those statutes.In the gay marriage cases, on the other hand, the explicitclassification drawn by the statutes is one of sex. Although thearguments used to justify the statutes might be homophobic, thelegislators have not chosen to classify based on sexual orientation.The unlikelihood that they will - the improbability of statesadopting laws that prohibit homosexual persons from marrying -speaks to the deeply imbricated nature of sex and sexual orienta-tion. Legislators may well understand their actions as penalizinghomosexuals rather than women, and especially as penalizing openhomosexuality, but the fact that what seems the most direct andobvious mechanism for doing so is a distinction based on sexrather than sexual orientation illustrates how this situation isdifferent from that of Stein's hypothetical sex discriminationchallenge to anti-miscegenation laws.It is also worth pointing out that, however favored by progres-sive scholars, anti-subordination theory is not the law. The anti-subordination language of Loving was dicta;5\" the reliance oncolor-blindness and formal neutrality in constitutional jurisprudencehas increased, not decreased, since that decision.5' If courts wereto assert the inadequacy of anti-subordination reasoning as adoctrinal bar to sex discrimination claims in gay marriage cases,that rationale would reek of intellectual dishonesty.Most significant for women as a class, rather than LGBTpeople as a class, is the function of sex-based distinctions toproduce and enforce norms that privilege masculinity. Although50 The Court held that use of an explicit racial classification was sufficientto find the law unconstitutional. See Loving, 388 U.S. at 10-11.\"' See, e.g., Neil Gotanda, A Critique of \"Our Constitution Is Color-Blind,\"44 STAN. L. REv. 1 (1991) (detailing the modem Court's progression from theexplicit recognition of racial differences in cases like Brown v. Board ofEducation, where the Court endorsed the distinction to right a prior wrong; to themodem Court's more explicit attempts to adopt a purely race-neutral approach,rejecting any law relying on any types of racial classifications, even thoseestablishing corrective elements, such as affirmative action).411JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICYsuch norms may also constrain some men, what matters forpurposes of this analysis is that they constrain all women.III. DEFINITION THEORYGender-linked stereotypes about sexuality are not just aboutbehavior. They are about what people perceive as definition, andthat definition turns on the naturalness and the thoroughness ofmale-female difference. Thus there is some truth to the trope of theearly gay marriage cases that the claim could not succeed becauseof the very definition of marriage. The use of sex discriminationarguments in these gay rights cases profoundly challenges thedefinition of gender, and will inevitably resonate in women's rightscases.I think that there are two logics possible for answering thedefinition argument directly. The first, which I reject, is to arguethat heterosexual sexual behavior itself is intrinsically determinedby gender roles. Sexuality is a knowledge/power system that isgendered and through which gender flows, but I do not believe thatsexual practices are a simple function of gender. The socialorganization and understanding of sexual practices cannot bereduced to a function of gender.52The other logical response, which I embrace, is what I will calldefinition theory. It is precisely the act of defining male andfemale, masculinity and femininity, which inscribes gender.5 3Koppelman discussed the function of gender polarities in perpetuat-ing a dominance system, noting that polarities enable hierarchy.54Definition theory takes that point deeper. It is in the process ofdefinition that the difference is constructed.52 See Gayle Rubin, Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politicsof Sexuality, in PLEASURE AND DANGER: EXPLORING FEMALE SEXUALITY 267-319 (Carole S. Vance ed., 1984).\" See, e.g., ANNE FAUSTO-STERLING, MYTHS OF GENDER: BIOLOGICALTHEORIES ABOUT WOMEN AND MEN passim (1989) (studies from biology);THOMAS LAQUEUR, MAKING SEX: BODY AND GENDER FROM THE GREEKS TOFREUD passim (1992) (studies from history); JUDITH BUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE:FEMINISM AND THE SUBVERSION OF IDENTITY 6-7 (1990) (cultural studies).14 Koppelman, supra note 12, at 202, 234-38.GAY RIGHTS CASESKatherine Franke has most fully developed this idea as itapplies to the operations of law.\" Franke argues that the processof definition, \"[t]he authority to define particular categories ortypes of people and to decide to which category a particular personbelongs,\" is a social practice that reflects dominant power struc-tures, not self-evident facts of nature.56 In the realm of sexdistinctions, she examines a series of cases that turn on an\"ideology of sexual difference,\" 57 despite apparently contradictoryfacts.58 Her conclusion is that \"[b]iology is both a wrong and51 See Katherine M.

Corbett, 1971 P. 83 (1970), an English court was asked todetermine whether or not April Ashley was a woman at the time of her marriageto Arthur Corbett, a man. Born a man, but having undergone a successful sex-reassignment surgery, Ms. Ashley had 'remarkably good' female genitals,\" hadfemale hormonal levels, and \"passed easily as a woman.\" Franke, supra note 55,at 45. Yet, at all times, she had male chromosomes; thus, the court determined,\"an individual's sex is permanently fixed at birth and cannot be later changed... \" Franke, supra note 55, at 46. In deciding that Ms. Ashley was, at the timeof the marriage, \"a man,\" the court noted plainly: \"these submissions, in effect,confuse sex with gender. Marriage is a relationship which depends on sex andnot on gender.\" Franke, supra note 55, at 47.In City of Columbus v. Zanders, 266 N.E.2d 602 (Ohio Mun. 1970), in thecontext of criminal sumptuary laws, a Columbus, Ohio, court convicted a pre-operative male to female transgendered person who was arrested three times fordressing as a woman. Zanders was fulfilling part of his pre-operative therapy.The court upheld the conviction, although noting that the sumptuary lawsoperated to reinforce gender norms, on the ground that the law prevented thecross-dresser from perpetrating a fraud on the general public. Franke, supra note55, at 66. A year later, however, the Ohio Supreme Court struck down the samestatute for lack of a scienter requirement. City of Columbus v.

Supp. 552 (D.S.C. 1994), the court wasasked to allow the plaintiff, a woman, access to the Citadel, an exclusively malemilitary college. The court considered that there were \"some real differencesbetween men and women,\" and thus there were some legitimate reasons foraccommodating those differences. Id. at 563. The court focused, however, not on413JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICYdangerous place to ground antidiscrimination law because it failsto account for the manner in which every sexual biological fact ismeaningful only within a gendered frame of reference.\"'5 9Janet Halley has made a comparable point about the definitionof sexual orientation and the roles of law in constructing andenforcing homo- or heterosexuality. 60 Halley points out that thelegal definition of homosexuality changes depending on context; asone moves from sodomy law discourse to adoption laws to militaryregulations, the same individual might be first defined into, thenout of, the category of homosexual.6' In some instances (but notothers), the disjuncture between gender role behavior and anatomi-62cal sex is determinative. 2 In the gay marriage cases, thoseconstitutive forces of law - the construction of sex and of sexualorientation - converge.I will admit that the phrase \"definition theory\" is provocative,perhaps unnecessarily so. Either of the other approaches isdoctrinally sufficient to sustain a sex discrimination claim, and thisis the most controversial framing of a justification. I use it tointentionally invoke what opponents of gay marriage have relied onas their primary argument, the assertion that the very definition ofany \"real\" differences - meaning biological or even gender-based. Rather, thecourt focused on the need for privacy in public restrooms. Franke's response:\"Yet there are no significant differences in male and female anatomy that requireseparate and distinct sanitary facilities. Although privacy may be an importantcultural value, it is not a 'real difference' of the kind courts demand when itrequires that separate facilities be justified by real and demonstrative differenc-es.\" Franke, supra note 55, at 82. Ultimately, however, the court held for theplaintiff, and Shannon Faulkner entered the Citadel. Faulkner, 858 F. Supp. at569.59 Franke, supra note 55, at 98.60 Janet E.

The point is not whethermarriage has always been understood to be defined that way,63 oreven that the definition relies on an impermissible classification, as\"voter\" once was defined as white or male. The more fundamentalclaim is that current marriage law actively creates and enforcesgender hierarchy by constructing the social meaning of male-femaledifference.64 Although Franke does not invoke marriage as anexample of her theory, in many respects it is the prime example of''an ideology of sexual difference.\"An argument that marriage can exist without sexual differenceimplies that gender polarity is not essential for a (perhaps the)primary social unit. Such dispensability indicates that gender'sperceived salience and importance have been more the product ofsocial structures and processes than of biology or nature. Thatnotion can be simultaneously discomforting and liberatory forwomen (as well as for men).Perhaps in part as a result of the ambivalence among women,a curious divergence is developing between judicial reasoning andsocial perception in the LGBT cases decided on sex discriminationgrounds. Despite holdings based on a finding of sex discrimination,the rulings are accepted (to the extent that they are) and describedin popular media as being about \"gay rights.\" The problem withthis development is not only that the courts duck a confrontationwith the anti-gay animus which is at work, as discussed supra, butthe potential liberatory impact of such rulings is sharply truncated.The primary challenge, therefore, may be to feminist rightsadvocates: to claim the full meaning of such rulings and tointerpret them socially, as well as legally, as victories for women.CONCLUSIONAs long as there is no federal statutory protection65 or height-63 For a strong argument that this belief is incorrect, see WILLIAM N.ESKRIDGE, JR., THE CASE FOR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE 15-44 (1996).64 See Hunter, supra note 32.65 See Steven A.
