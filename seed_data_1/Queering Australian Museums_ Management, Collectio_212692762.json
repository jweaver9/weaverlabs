It looks at four areas of museums—management, collections, exhibitions, and connections with audiences and communities—to consider barriers and enablers of queer inclusion in these often heteronormative institutions. Case studies of queer-inclusive efforts in public Australian museums are interpreted from institutional and community perspectives drawn from 25 interviews. The interviews are put into critical conversation with archival material and literature from museum studies and the emerging field of queer museology.  The study evaluates the visibility of the history, cultures, and identities of queer communities in Australian museums. It establishes that many public representations of queerness have been driven by the efforts of LGBTIQ communities, particularly through community-based heritage organisations. It also gathers and reflects upon examples of critical queer inclusion that have occurred in public museums. Using these exemplars, it argues that queer communities should be empowered to make decisions about their own heritage with the support of museums and their unique attributes; that individual and organisational leadership, involving queer individuals and allies, should be brought to bear on this task; and that effectively navigating the tensions between museums and queer communities requires mutual understanding and accommodation. Through the process of queering the museum, it is suggested, each party might be transformed, leading to LGBTIQ diversity being valued as an integral part of society.  The thesis addresses the gap in Australian museum studies literature on queer or LGBTIQ inclusion compared with Euro-American settings. It further contributes original case studies to the international field of queer museology, and to museum studies literature on including and empowering diverse communities. Both recognising the agency of queer communities and also engaging with the language and conventions of museums, it constructs a distinct account of how to navigate the historical tensions between the two. It thereby aims to enrich museum offerings for all audiences on the terms of those erstwhile excluded.  iv Acknowledgements  It takes a village to finish a thesis.

In my experience, LGBTIQ issues are almost invisible in museums that I have seen in Australia.…I consider that a museum, drawing on the archives of the LGBTIQ community in Australia, should be established (Michael Kirby, 2015, interview).  Julie McCrossin (a well-known Australian broadcaster and lesbian activist) and Michael Kirby (a gay-identified former justice of the High Court) announced their support for a permanent LGBTIQ museum following the opening of the pop-up Mardi Gras Museum (MGM), Sydney, in 2013 (Figure 1). That representatives of queer communities called for a museum brings together two historically disparate groups. On the one hand, as Kirby points out, ‘LGBTIQ issues are almost invisible in museums.’ Yet, public museums are increasingly looking for ways to engage and empower diverse communities. On the other hand, queer communities have formed their own cultural infrastructure out of necessity, though there are growing demands for inclusion within museums and the whole societies they serve. Queering Australian Museums begins at the convergence of these trends, and considers ways in which queer communities can be further included in Australian museums on their own terms.   2  Figure 1: The Mardi Gras Museum (29 January–3 March 2013). Image courtesy of Violet Tingle  In many ways, the history of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (Mardi Gras), which the MGM covered, tracks the increasing acceptance and visibility of queer communities in Australia. The first Mardi Gras on 24 June 1978 was held symbolically close to the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots (28 June 1969) that invigorated LGBTIQ movements worldwide. Like the Stonewall Riots, the first Mardi Gras was violently ended by police but has since become emblematic of resistance against discrimination and oppression. The annual parade and festival would continue to be targeted, with the City of Sydney remaining ‘a considerable thorn in the side…until the mid-1980s’ (Carbery, 1995b, p. 19) and NSW politician Fred Nile leading 1,500 Christians up Oxford Street—a centre of LGBTIQ social life—in 1989 to end the ‘obscene, indecent, blasphemous, offensive homosexual and lesbian marches through the streets of Sydney’ (Willett, 2000, p. 202).  However, there have been remarkable social and political changes for LGBTIQ Australians since the first Mardi Gras, reflected in the widespread appeal of the event. In 2017, the parade attracted 12,000 participants and 250,000 spectators (Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, 2017). The NSW Police Force (2015), which harshly quelled the inaugural event, appointed gay and lesbian liaison officers in 1990, has marched in the parade since  3 1998, and apologised in 2016 for its severe use of force. And, whereas in 1989 the NSW Minister of Tourism instructed the tourism commission not to provide information on the event, it is now actively promoted as a major drawcard to the city (Markwell, 2002, p. 94); the NSW Parliament has also apologised for its role in the incident and legislative discrimination (Dumas, 2016). Reflecting on the marked turn of events, Dennis Altman (2013)—a prominent activist of the Gay Liberation Movement—observed that ‘[o]ver forty years, Australia moved from a general atmosphere of disapproval to grudging tolerance, and then to the current mood of cautious acceptance’ (p. 154). Although it represents progress towards the appreciation of LGBTIQ diversity as a valued part of society, acceptance has been uneven. Indeed, the representativeness of the Mardi Gras organisation is periodically called into question, justifiably when, for example, the 1983–84 committee included one woman among seventeen men (Carbery, 1995b, p. 54). More broadly, issues such as access to IVF and adoption, LGBTIQ refugees, and medical support for diverse gender identities fail to attract as much attention as did the issue of same-sex marriage.   The above extensive positive developments throw into relief the relative invisibility of LGBTIQ diversity in museums. As will be developed throughout the enquiry, museum theory and practice continue to be influenced by heteronormativity, defined as ‘the institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make heterosexuality seem not only coherent – that is, organized as a sexuality – but also privileged’ (Berlant & Warner, 2005, p. 309). Some of the resulting effects—applying the idea of the ‘invisible knapsack’ developed by feminist and anti-racist scholar Peggy McIntosh (1989)—are outlined in the following ‘invisible knapsack of heterosexual privilege.’   1. I can go to a museum and be validated in my identity 2. I can go to a museum that reflects my intimate life without having to catch an international flight 3. I can use the bathroom at a museum and be sure that no one will question my right to be there. I do not have to use the disabled toilet even if I am able-bodied 4. I can feel safe in the knowledge that a museum will protect me from discrimination across all its areas of influence 5. I can be sure that all the dimensions of difference that are important to me will be  4 captured in audience research and development 6. I can assume when museums refer to the ‘general public,’ they are referring to me 7. I can be sure that when I go to see an exhibition that I myself will not be on exhibition 8. I can look at promotional material and see my relationships reflected within 9. I can show affection towards my partner in a museum without being stared at 10. I can bring my family to a museum and be considered eligible for family pricing 11. I can consider museums as a resource in the development of my child, whoever my child may be. It is not questioned that I am the child’s parent 12. I can do research that is relevant to my experiences and it can be recognised as scholarly and not only personally motivated 13. I can be issued research material without having to be led to a cordoned-off area because I have been told that it is ‘pornography’ (this occurred to the author at a major state library). I can be sure that all material was categorised according to the same criteria 14. I can work in a museum and not become the automatic spokesperson for ‘my community.’ If I choose to do so, I will be rewarded on that basis 15. I can work in a museum and feel as if there are employee and professional networking groups that reflect my interests. Forms that I am required to complete reflect my gender identity 16. I can easily point to several major exhibitions over the past ten years that have centred on people like me. I can expect such exhibitions not to rely on stereotypes. I can be sure that major sponsors did not distance themselves from these exhibitions due to prejudice. I can expect that they were supported and promoted by all levels of management  17. I can assume that if gender identity or sexuality is not mentioned in a label, then the subject of the label is heterosexual and fits within the concept of binary sex / gender. I can further assume that neither gender identity nor sexuality is relevant in this case 18. I can read a comment book and not feel personally attacked 19. I can offer interpretations of collection items without them being summarily dismissed as speculative. I can easily undertake research using public collections and repositories to validate my claims  5 20. I can be sure that the standardised taxonomies, thesauruses, keywords, and categories used within a museum do not omit important aspects of my identity Figure 2: The ‘invisible knapsack’ of heterosexual privilege in museums  Addressing these effects of heteronormativity in museums provides the broad rationale for the project. Despite considerable social and legal changes that have swung perceptions of LGBTIQ people from ‘criminals, sinners, perverted or sick’ towards ‘equal citizens in a diverse twenty-first century Australia’ (Reynolds & Robinson, 2016, p. 255), such changes have not registered their full impact within museums. Consequently, McCrossin, Kirby, and members of other community groups have appealed for more inclusion within museums. While they share the desire for museums to legitimise their identities and bolster their sense of belonging, disagreements arise from distinct ways of navigating the museum / community divide, contrasting notions of sameness and difference from broader society, views on entitlement to public support, and the desire for community control. These points of difference recur in many contexts involving communities, not only the MGM and Mardi Gras, but also in the interfaces between museums and communities generally. The project is, then, closely connected with broader changes within museum theory and practice that the thesis draws and builds upon. Through exploring ways to attend to the accumulated results of heteronormativity, museums might not only reflect external developments, but also actively participate in welcoming and celebrating queer communities.  1.1 Research problem, definitions, and contribution  Having outlined the background to the research, the problem of how queer or LGBTIQ communities can be further included in Australian museums on their own terms emerges. Central to the enquiry is the tension between museums and these communities. The thesis starts from the premise that addressing it will involve working ‘on the terms of’ the latter, congruent with the acknowledgment in museum studies that in contemporary developments ‘it will be the public, not the museum, that occupies the superior position’ (Weil, 1997, p. 257). The ‘how’ of the enquiry elicits measures that can be applied in museum organisations, particularly social history museums. To this end, successive chapters will look at the areas of management, collections, exhibitions, and connections. While the first three correspond to accepted areas of museum theory and practice, the last, ‘Queering  6 connections,’ was chosen to examine the overlapping relationships between museums, queer communities, and wider audiences. ‘Connection’ is broader than ‘collaboration,’ which implies temporary consultation or co-production, but extends to the analysis of the conditions in which these stakeholders can develop lasting links (Simon, 2010, p. 235). The ‘how’ of the research problem further allows the investigation of measures that have worked and those that have not. It aligns with the aim of the thesis of identifying barriers and enablers of further queer inclusion in museums.  The areas of the museum in which the research problem are examined are selected to survey a broad cross-section of the museum organisation. They roughly cover all parts of the definition of museums given by Museums Australia (2002):  A museum helps people understand the world by using objects and ideas to interpret the past and present and explore the future. A museum preserves and researches collections, and makes objects and information accessible in actual and virtual environments. Museums are established in the public interest as permanent, not-for-profit organisations that contribute long-term value to communities.  This narrow definition focuses on the collecting, exhibiting, and research functions of museums. A more comprehensive account might include administration and management, marketing and communications, ethics, education, strategic planning, community relations, online engagement, security, architecture, and retail. Alongside the core areas of collections and exhibitions, management (Chapter 4) was selected in order to investigate the operating environment of Australian museums that affects all museum activities including queer inclusion. ‘Queering connections,’ in looking at relationships that museums must negotiate, additionally involves the areas of museum education, management of controversy, community engagement, and collaboration (Chapter 7). Taken together, the chapters of the thesis reflect upon a wide range of museum functions that need to be ‘queered’ as part of the overall project of queering museums.  Other key terms including ‘community,’ ‘queer,’ and ‘LGBTIQ’ require clarification. The first has been described as a ‘“warmly persuasive word to describe an existing set of relationships,” implying a connection – such as kinship, cultural heritage, shared values and  7 goals’ (Williams, 1976, p. 76). Mason (2005) expands on the multiplicity of communities which include:  (1) Communities defined by shared historical or cultural experiences; (2) Communities defined by their specialist knowledge; (3) Communities defined by demographic / socio-economic factors; (4) Communities defined by identities (national, regional, local, or relating to sexuality, disability, age and gender); (5) Communities defined by their visiting practices; (5) Communities defined by their exclusion from other communities (pp. 206–207).  Museum and heritage scholars have critiqued prolific, imprecise use of the term ‘community’ in the arts and cultural sectors and in government policies. Waterton and Smith (2009) argue that the way that heritage professionals have used it has largely maintained their authority to construct and speak on behalf of communities (p. 5). They do not dismiss the term, however, but call for its critical deployment while recognising that they are: internally diverse, not necessarily tied to geographical location, and interrelated as members can belong to multiple communities (p. 18). Crooke (2006) is also conscious that the concept can be manipulated, but acknowledges its symbolic importance ‘as part of the inevitable human processes of creating collective identities and generated sense of belonging’ (p. 174). Accordingly, museum professionals must be self-reflexive in examining their role in selecting and legitimising community representatives. ‘Queer communities’ and ‘LGBTIQ communities’ are used in the thesis while being aware that ‘like other communities [by the late 1970s] it would have its internal division, its conflicts, and – even – its moments of agreement’ (Wotherspoon, 1991, p. 205).   Terminological debates also revolve around ‘queer’ and ‘LGBTIQ’ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer).1 Queer, in particular, can be interpreted in contradictory ways, and as both a noun and verb. Taken as a noun, it can be used to capture the diversity of non-heterosexual ways of being, broadly speaking, the non-normative sex, gender, and sexual diversity of society. Functioning in this way, it is an umbrella term demarcating those who—at different times and places—might have been called LGBTIQ, homosexual,                                                 1 Other variations of LGBTIQ include LGBT, LGBTQ, GLBT, LGBTI, LGBTQIA (including asexual), and LGBTTQQIAAP (further encompassing questioning, asexual, ally, and pansexual).  8 camp, invert, sodomite, Uranian, Sapphic, homophile, and myriad other terms. Queer is therefore broader than LGBTIQ and yet both can be taken to group categories of identities. Both terms are used in the thesis, though LGBTIQ is used where it reflects its deployment in mainstream usage and governmental, bureaucratic, and museum environments. Terminology used by sources like ‘homosexual’ and ‘gay and lesbian’ is adopted when it more accurately reflects the binaries implied by the material (e.g. homosexual / heterosexual and male / female). The thesis strategically essentialises ‘queerness’ (the cultures, histories, identities, and ideas of queer communities) in order to critically deploy the language and approaches that are most convincing to museums.2 In addition, ‘queer-relevant’ is a phrase used to identify material significant to queer communities without making categorical claims about its nature, an idea further developed in section 5.4.  The other sense of ‘queer’ resists the above, particularly its reliance on categorisation and identification. As queer artist Matt Smith (2015), who deploys both senses of ‘queer’ points out, ‘[t]here is an irony in that queer studies is a study of identity and queer theory a deconstruction of identity’ (p. 35). Instead, in reclaiming a derogatory word, it has come to embody an activist practice and theoretical toolkit that ‘rejects a minoritizing logic of toleration or simple political interest-representation in favor of a more thorough resistance to regimes of the normal’ (Warner, 1993, p. xxvi). Some of the effects of ‘regimes of the normal’ or heteronormativity were outlined in Figure 2. In seeking to shift norms to be more inclusive of queer diversity, the thesis also draws upon ‘queer’ in its verb form. The ‘queering’ in the chapter titles thus describes the action of engaging with the language and processes of museum organisations to re-orient them towards queer communities. The                                                 2 Strategic essentialism ‘utilizes the idea of essence with a recognition of and critique of the essentialist nature of the essence itself. It is a means of using group identity as a basis of struggle while also debating issues related to group identity within the group’ (Wolff, 2007). Hence, while queer communities may refer to ‘the LGBT community’ or ‘the gay and lesbian community’ to strengthen their claims to recognition, internal debate over boundaries and objectives continues.  9 present enquiry combines both senses of queer and uses it alongside LGBTIQ to speak to multiple audiences in museum and community contexts.3  A final term is required to refer to the organisations that queer communities have established in order to preserve their own heritage. It is necessary because ‘museum’ is not broad enough to encompass their flexible appropriation of practices from the GLAM sector (i.e. galleries, libraries, archives, and museums). Thus, the term ‘queer community heritage organisations’ (QCHOs) is introduced in the thesis, similar to the term ‘community-based heritage organization’ used elsewhere (Keith, 2012). The Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives (ALGA), established in Melbourne in 1978, is the largest QCHO in Australia. It is run by volunteers from the LGBTIQ community using donations from its members and supporters. Although an archive in name, its involvement with the MGM and many other exhibitions, its organisation of history walks, and its collection of books and a small number of objects illustrate that ‘[i]n practice distinctions between community archives…and museums…or indeed between community libraries…are not at all precise nor necessarily very useful’ (Flinn & Stevens, 2009, pp. 5–6). Incorporating QCHOs in this study on queering museums is essential to investigating the tension between museums and queer communities, and recognising that they have driven many queer interventions in museums. QCHOs were established to sidestep public institutions in which these communities were historically not represented, underrepresented, or misrepresented.4 They will likely remain crucial actors in public representations of queerness.                                                 3 The use of ‘queer’ in this way has precedent. Queer theorist Michael Warner (1993) writes that ‘[q]ueer activists are also lesbians and gays in other contexts—as for example where leverage can be gained through bourgeois propriety, or through minority-rights discourse.…Queer politics has not just replaced older modes of lesbian and gay identity; it has come to exist alongside those older modes’ (p. xxviii). It can be considered another form of strategic essentialism (see footnote 2). 4 The issue of representativeness, according to cultural studies academic Tony Bennett (2003), is ‘a cluster of normative demands that are now placed on museums: first…they should aim to address the interests of all sections of society; second, that museum exhibitions and displays should be respectful in their depiction of cultural differences, and accord equal value to the varied cultures they put on show; and third that such exhibitions should be informed by the distinctive perspectives and knowledges of the particular social groups in question’ (p. 4). That is, the concern with queer representativeness is broader than equal representation but includes how communities are depicted and their involvement with shaping those portrayals.  10  In investigating the research problem—how queer or LGBTIQ communities can be further included in Australian museums on their own terms—this thesis addresses the gap in scholarly consideration of queer-inclusive museum efforts in the Australian context compared with Euro-American settings. By developing original case studies drawing on underutilised archives and interviews with community activists, scholars, and museum workers, it additionally contributes to queer museology and to museum studies literature on including and empowering diverse communities. A distinct approach to museum / community engagements will be developed across four key areas of museums, based on an evaluation of barriers and enablers of equitable inclusion. It has significant implications for museum best practice, which could facilitate further inclusion on the terms of queer communities.  1.2 Chapter outline  Having provided the background to the thesis, outlined the research problem, and indicated its contribution, the next chapter will review the literature in queer museology, the scholarly meeting point between museums and queer communities. This area of study extends the work in museum studies on social inclusion and community engagement. Therefore, the literature review starts with a broad historical overview of these concerns within museum studies through the lens of ‘new museology,’ which established the space in which the representational critiques of queer communities could be articulated. The international dimensions of this literature concentrated in Euro-American settings will be discussed, before consideration is given to its Australian dimensions. Some limitations found include the dearth of material that responds to Australian specificities, and a lack of works that considers the museum organisation broadly.  The limitations of the queer museological literature provide further justification for the project. ‘Chapter 3: Methodology’ discusses how the research addresses these limitations and the research problem. Namely, case studies are used to explore issues in the areas of management, collections, exhibitions, and connections. Given the lack of published material, particularly on community-based sites, primary research through interviews and  11 archival sources is required. Related issues including the positionality of the researcher, methodological limitations, and ethics are then considered.   The case study methodology is initially applied in the chapter ‘Queering management.’ Starting with the formal and informal factors that affect the operation of museum organisations is important as they structure queer interventions that can occur in all other museum areas. It will be argued that some enable, while others remain a barrier against, increasing social and queer inclusion. The historical development of Australian museums, and their relationship to coordinating and funding bodies, also tend to inhibit uniform change across the sector. Nonetheless, case studies of the social justice activities of the Australian Museum, Sydney—particularly during the 1990s—will show that individual and collective leadership in pursuing queer inclusion is possible in such an environment. The importance of establishing structures enabling inclusion work, alongside supporting museum workers who undertake it, will be developed. Unfortunately, communicating the value of inclusion work remains a weakness, which has deleterious effects across museum organisations. In a fundamental way, then, the success of queer inclusion is tied to wider efforts to critique the utilitarian lens through which museums are often viewed.  The lack of consideration of LGBTIQ diversity in managerial decisions is echoed in collections where it is largely invisible. Chapter 5 starts by outlining the reasons behind the dearth of relevant museum objects and collections including the peripheral concern with social history until recently; intentional and unintentional destruction of material; the fragility of collecting efforts; and the deficiency of formal frameworks. However, critiques of the modernist museum have opened up the space for collection items to take on multiple meanings. ‘Queer readings’ operate in this fashion, destabilising the link between objects and meaning in order to produce queer resonances. Using a flexible interpretive approach, queer artists, activists, and historians have queered existing collections alongside adding new material. Resistance is sometimes encountered, however, evidenced by criticism of the Victorian Material Survey—the largest LGBTIQ collection survey conducted in Australia—for its supposed lack of historical rigour (section 5.4.1). Countering the invisibility of queerness, it is affirmed, requires the application of a range of strategies including collecting oral histories and questioning conventions around permanence and object-centredness. Rather than signalling the demise of collections, evidence will be given  12 that working with and beyond existing approaches can invigorate them with new dimensions of relevance.  The following chapter, Chapter 6, looks at another key area in which queer communities have sought to counter invisibility: exhibitions. They have the exceptional ability to bring issues to public attention, which is why they have been used since the late 1970s to pursue these communities’ cultural and political goals. ‘Queering exhibitions’ undertakes two tasks: to evaluate the displays using data from a comprehensive survey (Appendix C: Queer exhibitions in Australia, 1977–2016); and second to argue against some firm recommendations offered in the queer museological literature. Contrasting positions have emerged that favour community-based or public exhibitions, integrative or separatist exhibitions, programming during festivals or on a permanent basis, giving more or less emphasis on HIV/AIDS, and attempting to represent queerness collectively or focusing on forms of internal diversity. It will be shown that these choices have multiple and contradictory effects that counsel against all-encompassing proposals. Rather, with an awareness of the resulting multiple effects, exhibition developers can make choices that respond to their operating environments.  ‘Queering connections’ looks at the overlapping relationships between queer communities, museums, and audiences to identify conditions under which they productively and equitably connect. These relationships are invoked and renegotiated when museums attempt to create relevant education and learning programming; anticipate and respond to controversy; negotiate with community-based heritage organisations; and collaborate with LGBTIQ groups. Forming connections between the above groups is part of continuing attempts by public museums to engage with communities generally. It is also subject to additional, distinct constraints that are the effects of heteronormativity. The chapter indicates that the boundaries of inclusion can be expanded by continually pushing against barriers in order to create lasting connections. Reflecting on instances where the aims of queer communities and museums have not connected because of mistrust and misunderstanding can guide future initiatives.  The conclusion draws together the arguments and offers implications of Queering Australian Museums. It recounts the status quo of heteronormativity and invisibility within  13 museums, the factors that reproduce it, and the barriers against changing it. In contrast, examples of best practice among the case studies show that pressure can be placed on these norms. Although queer interventions have been limited compared with Euro-American settings, Australia has fared well in a number of areas. Using evidence from the Australian case studies, the conclusion suggests that the sustained empowerment of queer communities, and the support of queer individuals and allies, can assist in further including queerness across museum organisations. It again ties the task to broader developments within museum theory and practice, a connection that also reiterates LGBTIQ diversity as a fundamental element of social diversity. Finally, the limitations of the thesis in terms of its breadth are translated into suggestions for future research including focusing on individual organisations and types of organisations, artist interventions, the role of queer festivals, and studying not only the diversity of external communities but also the internal diversity of the museum sector.  14 2 Literature review: Queer museology  The last ten years have seen the formation of queer museology, the scholarly meeting point between museums and queer communities. This chapter situates queer museology within the critical evaluation of museums signalled by the ‘new museology.’ The first section demarcates the conception of the museum that the new museology sought to remodel, what could be called ‘old’ museology. The next section surveys the broad range of issues covered by the new museology including: renegotiating the relationship between museums and society; concern with social justice, equality, diversity, inclusion, and human rights; and the empowerment of communities and audiences. Queer museology assists in fulfilling the aims of the new museology to reflect social diversity equitably by drawing attention to its LGBTIQ dimensions. Both its international and Australian aspects will be evaluated in successive sections.  2.1 ‘Old’ museology  In the volume The New Museology that contributed to the prominence of the term in English-language museum studies, art historian Peter Vergo (1989a) expressed the division between ‘old’ and ‘new museology’ as the following:  At the simplest level, I would define it as a state of widespread dissatisfaction with the “old” museology, both within and outside the museum profession.…[W]hat is wrong with the “old” museology is that it is too much about museum methods, and too little about the purpose of museums (p. 3; emphasis in original).  While there are some common elements to different accounts of ‘old’ museology, these imply more coherence than is necessarily the case. Nevertheless, as will be outlined, critiques from many critical directions in the latter half of the twentieth century identify elements of the paradigm.  Theodor Adorno was a critical theorist who helped to develop the concept of the ‘culture industry,’ describing the mechanisms generating cultural products that maintained capitalist  15 interests (Horkheimer & Adorno, 1972). He positioned museums as one such mechanism, comparing museums to mausoleums:  The German word, “museal” [“museumlike”], has unpleasant overtones. It describes objects to which the observer no longer has a vital relationship and which are in the process of dying. They owe their preservation more to historical respect than to the needs of the present. Museum and mausoleum are connected by more than phonetic association (Adorno, 1967, p. 175).  The idea that museums are ‘dry, dusty places, with cobwebs on the displays, and staffed by surly, unwelcoming or even rude museum attendants’ continues to be widely held (Black, 2005, p. 79). Hence, museums for some non-users and critics have never overcome their old museological foundations.  Other accounts engaging with the history and philosophy of museums have critiqued their disciplinary and modernist genealogies. Public museums are the product of ‘Renaissance humanism, 18th century Enlightenment and 19th century democracy’ (Dalibard, 1986, p. 2). The transition of museum collections from private, aristocratic displays of power to state-controlled possessions held ostensibly for public benefit has been the subject of intense interest for museum historians. Museum theorist and educator Eilean Hooper-Greenhill (1989) investigated French museums in the Renaissance and post-Revolutionary periods. As the new episteme—a system of knowing and knowledge—gradually supplanted the previous, a new regime of oppositions including ‘private / public, closed / open, tyranny / liberty, superstition / knowledge, inherited wealth / courage’ was overlaid onto the ancien régime and the newly created Republic (p. 71). For Hooper-Greenhill, the modern, disciplinary museum that emerged was viewed by the state as an instrument that could improve and educate the public. In the new modernist episteme, the ideal museum was ‘positivist, objective, rational, evaluative, distanced, and set aside from the real world’ (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000, p. 130). Instead of authority ultimately residing in God or the sovereign, its power now resided in the state and its institutions.  Cultural studies academic Tony Bennett (1995) gives a similar account to Hooper-Greenhill on the emergence of the modern museum. To him, museums during the late eighteenth and  16 early nineteenth centuries began to be used as technologies to regulate the populace; accordingly, they ‘might help lift the level of popular taste and design; they might limit the appeal of the tavern…they might help prevent riot and sedition’ (p. 21). The movement of objects into the public domain and invitation of citizens to view them allow for ‘the exhibitionary complex’ to emerge. Applying philosopher Michel Foucault’s (1979) concept of the ‘disciplinary society’ to the museum, Bennett argues that public exhibitions involved individuals in their own regulation:   [T]hey sought to allow people, and en masse rather than individually, to know rather than be known, to become the subjects rather than the objects of knowledge. Yet, ideally, they sought also to allow people to know and thence to regulate themselves…interiorizing [power’s] gaze as a principle of self-surveillance and, hence, self-regulation (Bennett, 1995, p. 63).  While, in principle, the exercise of state power was applied equally to all citizens, and citizens in a democracy could participate in their own governance, other relations of power were in effect. Public museums were ‘envisaged as a place in which working classes would acquire more civilized habits by imitating their betters’ (p. 47). Given class hierarchies, while museums in the late nineteenth century were ‘intended for the people, they were not of the people in the sense of displaying any interest in the lives, habits, and customs of…the contemporary working classes’ (Bennett, 1988, p. 64; emphasis in original). This continued well into the twentieth century when French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu—known for integrating cultural capital into an analysis of class (Bourdieu, 1984)—in a 1969 empirical study concluded that art galleries and museums function as a way for the middle and upper classes to differentiate themselves from the working classes (Bourdieu, Darbel, & Schnapper, 1991).  In addition to maintaining class distinctions, museums were implicated in the latter half of the twentieth century for other inequities including colonialism and institutionalised sexism. The following indicative markers are representative of critiques mounted from postcolonial and feminist positions. Museums participated, to various degrees, in colonial processes, housing artefacts obtained through what are now considered dubious means, reinforcing problematic social and racial hierarchies, and displaying objects in ways  17 insensitive or indifferent to the wishes of source communities (Karp & Lavine, 1991; Peers & Brown, 2003).5 The systems of categorisation and ordering that were integral to the modernist episteme of museums placed white middle-class men at the pinnacle of creation (Hall, 1992). Accordingly, ethnologist Augustus Pitt Rivers (1906) whose system of classification was influential in museums at the time could say that ‘[l]owest amongst the existing races of the world of whom we have any accurate knowledge are the [Aboriginal] Australians’ (p. 11).6 Racialised hierarchies were increasingly scrutinised following the exposure of their extreme effects in WWII, and with progressive decolonisation of Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. In this environment, postcolonial theorist Edward Said (1978) produced the seminal text Orientalism, which applies to museums not only through the genre of Orientalist art, but also as a signal that Western paradigms were being challenged politically and intellectually.  On another front, the museum was coming under scrutiny for its participation in institutionalised sexism. Feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey (1975) argued in the influential article ‘Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema’ that ‘[i]n a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been split between active / male and passive / female’ (p. 11). Art critic John Berger (1972) similarly applied the idea of the male gaze to artworks in museums and galleries in Ways of Seeing. Echoing the construction of men as active and women as passive, he wrote ‘men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at’ (p. 47; emphasis in original). Yet there remained a disconnect between gender critiques and museum and gallery practices, leading to the formation of feminist artist group The Guerrilla Girls in 1985. In their first intervention, they put up posters around New York City. One of them asked ‘what do these artists have in common?’, listing 42 male artists before giving the answer ‘they allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than 10% women artists’ (Chadwick,                                                 5 ‘Source communities’ ‘(sometimes referred to as “originating communities”) refers to…groups in the past when artefacts were collected, as well as to their descendants today’ (Peers & Brown, 2003, p. 2). 6 ‘Indigenous Australians’ is used in the thesis. However, it is often used interchangeably with ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’ people, ‘Aboriginal Australians,’ ‘First Australians,’ and ‘First Nations’ people.  18 1995, p. 8). The group continues to highlight gender inequality in museums and galleries internationally, showing that the issue persists.  The above challenges to the old museology on class-based, racial, and gendered grounds continue to play out in Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (2011) shows that attendance at museums and art galleries is skewed towards those with higher levels of educational attainment, higher levels of income, and who come from predominately English-speaking backgrounds. It is plausible that Bourdieu’s analysis of cultural capital and class distinction applies in this situation. Next, while there have been significant improvements in the relationship between museums and Indigenous communities—particularly in the ‘employment of Indigenous staff, the establishment of consultative processes and the broadening of specialist professional knowledge’ (Healy, 2006, p. 16.12)—social inequality ultimately tied to colonisation persists.7 Finally, there continues to be unequal representation of women in museums and galleries, not least in collection representation but also in management positions (Richardson, 2014). Curator Mandy Paul (2016) reflects that ‘[i]n retrospect, the late 1980s and the first half of the 1990s may have been a high point of public discourse about women, history and representation within the museum sector’ (p. 154).  The continuation of ‘old’ practices in the contemporary museum environment calls into question the idea of a clear dividing line between the old and new museology. Both Hooper-Greenhill and Bennett have been criticised for portraying a monolithic portrait of the disciplinary, modernist museum that requires equally monumental change to overcome (Starn, 2005, pp. 73–74). However, their accounts can also be interpreted to permit co-existing projects. Foucault’s (1977) notion of ‘effective history,’ which is central to both authors, claims that ‘[t]he successes of history belong to those who are capable of seizing [the] rules.…[C]ontrolling this complex mechanism, they will make it function so as to overcome the rulers through their own rules’ (p. 151). ‘Succeeding,’ in this view, requires                                                 7 Numerous human rights issues affect the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia. In 2010–12, the average life expectancy was 10.6 years less for men and 9.5 years for women compared with non-Indigenous Australians; 1 in 12 are part of the Stolen Generations who were forcibly removed as children from their families; and incarceration rates are 15 times those of non-Indigenous people (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2014a).  19 taking control of the museum and transforming it. Instead of replacing existing rules with a new set of rules, it is also possible that the ‘old’ and ‘new’ are capable of co-existing, for example where a museum remains committed to scientific processes alongside opening up its collections to a range of social uses and meanings. Museum and heritage scholar Andrea Witcomb (2003) also questions this delineation, arguing that it is ‘impossible to reduce the museum to a single function, either now or in the past’ (p. 18). Thus, without the singular conception of the disciplinary museum offered by others, a ‘radical break’ between old and new becomes untenable (p. 14). The account of old museology given here, then, should not only be read as a description of museums in a historical period, but as a set of orientations that can carry on into the present. They can be shifted, it is suggested, not through total control, but provisional interventions.  2.2 New museology  In contrast with the characteristics of old museology is the new museology. While the latter arose in the 1980s, it is not considered here as bound to this period but rather as an important moment engendering concerns that continue to be relevant today: renegotiating the relationship between museums and society; promoting social justice, equality, diversity, inclusion, and human rights; and empowering communities and audiences. An outline of the period of transition in the Australian context will be given before a summary of literature pertaining to the above themes. It will be shown that despite burgeoning research in these areas, the conceptualisation of diversity and inclusion has paid insufficient attention to its LGBTIQ dimensions.  The short-lived Whitlam Government (1972–1975) implemented major reforms including repealing conscription laws, withdrawing Australian forces from the Vietnam War, abolishing tertiary education fees, introducing universal health care, appointing a women’s adviser to the Prime Minister, instituting no-fault divorce, and paving the way for the first Indigenous land rights legislation (Whitlam Institute, 2015). It also established several committees whose reports would have lasting impacts, including the ‘Royal Commission on Human Relationships’—among its recommendations that homosexuality be decriminalised, same-sex partners be granted equal rights, and that anti-discrimination measures be adopted—and the ‘Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National  20 Collections’ (producing the ‘Pigott Report’) (Pigott et al., 1975). The Pigott Report marks a key moment in the reassessment of Australian museums. It was also released at a time of major social and political changes, catalysed by movements such as Gay Liberation that demanded a ‘total revolution in social attitudes,’ not the changing of homosexuals (Altman, 1972, p. 57). Women and Indigenous activists were making similar claims: feminist Germaine Greer (1970) ended her influential book The Female Eunuch labelling reforms as ‘retrogressive. The old process must be broken, not made new’ (p. 331); and, after a policy of assimilation, Indigenous Australians exercised self-determination, for example, by starting thousands of community-run organisations since the mid-1970s (Page, 2015, p. 2)  The Pigott Report affirmed the contemporary social value of museums rather than as storehouses of ‘ancient objects,’ an image of old museology that mirrors Adorno’s portrayal of museums as mausoleums:  In the public notice [to the national press] the Committee stated that it did not see museums as simply buildings where ancient objects are preserved and displayed. It saw museums as vital places of education, entertainment and research where facets of the daily life of past generations of Australians can be seen and where our heritage of old trades, crafts and skills can be displayed and practised (Pigott et al., 1975, p. 1).  The ‘daily life of past generations’ conveys the turn towards social history that the report manifested, not a history of ‘heroic’ individuals but of ordinary people. The work of many new curators during this time was influenced by the ‘new social history’ or ‘history from below’ which, in turn, was in tune with political developments since the 1960s (Anderson, 2011, p. 2). Correspondingly, there was an increasing interest in the history of groups ‘such as women, ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples, which had previously been neglected or ignored’ (Gore, 2001, p. 46). After the appointment of the first curator of history at the Western Australian Museum in 1970, other museums followed. This trend continued throughout the 1970s and 80s, encouraged by state sesquicentennials and the bicentenary of white colonisation in 1988 (Paul, 2016, p. 142).   21 The Report recommended a national museum covering the interrelated themes of Indigenous history, non-Indigenous history, and their relationships to the environment, a proposal fulfilled over two decades later with the opening of the National Museum of Australia (NMA) in 2001. Illustrating the division between old and new museological approaches its involvement in the ‘history wars,’ it immediately attracted controversy for its ‘black armband’ approach to Indigenous history, particularly in its coverage of frontier violence (Windschuttle, 2001, p. 11).8 The Director of the NMA Dawn Casey defended the museum, stating the value of challenging visitors. In the address ‘Museums as agents for social and political change,’ she argued that 21st century museums are those ‘breaking new ground in redefining their national history, becoming more inclusive and accessible, and establishing themselves quite consciously as a forum for the debate of contemporary issues’ (p. 230). She further responded to Windschuttle’s assertion that ‘feminists, ethnics, indigenes and gays’ have not been significant historical actors by providing counterpoints represented within the museum, including Ron Muncaster’s 1994 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras costume (p. 232) (Figure 3). In keeping with the Pigott Report and later articulations of the new museology, the NMA presented social histories beyond privileged, nationalist narratives.                                                  8 The ‘history wars’ are a debate over how to interpret the colonisation of Australia, on the one hand as an invasion leading to genocide and, on the other, as mostly peaceful settlement (Macintyre & Clark, 2004); that is a ‘black armband’ versus a ‘three cheers’ view of history (McKenna, 1997). They continue to play out on a number of fronts including reference to Australia’s national day (January 26, marking the arrival of the British settlement fleet in 1788) as ‘Invasion Day.’ The National Museum of Australia was criticised by the conservative historian Keith Windschuttle (2001) for its supposed ‘political correctness,’ particularly its coverage of incidences of frontier violence (p. 11). The resulting controversy led the conservative Howard Government to commission a review of the museum. The subsequent report saw ‘more consensus than plurality at the core of the national collective consciousness’ and recommended that the museum emphasise the nation’s positive achievements (Carroll, Longes, Jones, & Vickers-Rich, 2003, pp. 8–9).  22  Figure 3: Ron Muncaster installs his 1994 Mardi Gras costume ‘Lucille Balls’ in the former permanent exhibition Eternity (2001–2017) at the National Museum of Australia. Image courtesy of the National Museum of Australia  Just as the principles of the NMA had been formed years prior to its opening, so too did the roots of the new museology extend decades before the publication of The New Museology (Vergo, 1989c). It was first developed by French theorists as la nouvelle muséologie from the 1970s, but would become widely influential in English-language museum contexts in the 1980s (Desvallées & Mairesse, 2009, p. 55). It was influenced by the political developments outlined above and, for Vergo, by the representational and civil rights politics of the 1960s (Marstine, 2006, p. 6). Its wide-ranging critiques scrutinised all aspects of the museum including ‘organizational structures, staffing, museum education, exhibition theory, display techniques, classification, labelling, media and management / business practices’ (Stam, 1993, p. 275). By attending to these, museums might be transformed into something qualitatively different from museums to date, what Hooper-Greenhill (2000)—who provided one of the outlines of the disciplinary museum above—calls the ‘post-museum.’ Among many other characteristics, ‘[i]n the post-museum, histories that have been hidden away are being brought to light, and in this, modernist master narratives are being challenged’ (p. 145); further, ‘knowledge becomes fragmented and multi-vocal…[where] [t]he voice of the museum is one among many’ (Hooper-Greenhill, 2007, p. 82).   23 A key aspect of the new museology was the empowerment of audiences and communities in relation to the museum. It was underlined in the literal re-definition of ‘museum’ in the 1972 United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) round table in Santiago, Chile, which placed the traditional functions of the museum into the service of society:  [T]he museum is an institution in the service of society of which it forms an inseparable part and, of its very nature, contains the elements which enable it to help in moulding the consciousness of the communities it services, through which it can stimulate those communities to action by projecting forward its historical activities so that they culminate in the presentation of contemporary problems (UNESCO, 1973, p. 199).  Although placing the museum in the service of society, ‘[m]oulding the consciousness of the communities it services’ can be interpreted as manipulation. Other analyses of the position of communities vis-à-vis museums sought more consensual involvement of communities like the ‘ecomuseum’ movement originating in France in the 1970s that sought the participation of local communities in support of their identity-making, welfare, and development (Harrison, 1993, p. 166). Still more active accounts of the role of communities consider empowerment to involve ‘transferring skills to others and providing opportunities for them to present their own points of view within the institutional context’ (Ames, 1990, p. 161). Although ‘empowerment’ is readily used in museum studies to refer to any one of these positions, there is an ascending scale of community involvement between ‘manipulation,’ ‘participation,’ and ‘present[ing] their own points of view.’ Thus, the frequently cited statement by museum administrator and scholar Stephen Weil (1997) that museums should change from ‘being about something to being for somebody’ (pp. 229–230; emphasis in original) can be contrasted with museum director Nina Simon’s (2010) extension of the ‘participatory museum’ which ‘[i]nstead of being “about” something or “for” someone’ should be ‘created and managed “with” visitors’ (p. iii). Empowerment might exist at multiple points on this scale, but claiming empowerment still requires close scrutiny (section 7.4: Contact zones and constraints).   24 The interest in empowering communities has led to the dramatic growth in books and readers on the subject of museums and communities, part of what Macdonald (2006b) has called ‘the Age of the Reader.’ While concerned with the tension between museums and communities, they have approached the relationship in divergent ways. Crooke (2007) states in Museums and Communities: Ideas, Issues and Challenges that ‘links between the two are far more intricate and independence too great to be able to say which needs the other more’ (pp. 1–2). In the edited volume Museums and Communities: Curators, Collections and Collaboration, Golding and Modest (2013) also underscore the ‘sometimes simplistic curator / community engagement dichotomy…[as] limiting either / or dualistic frameworks and social categories.…We want to push toward more liberating both / and conceptions’ (p. 2). In these outlines, the authors and editors emphasise the imbrication of museums and communities. Museum scholar Sheila Watson (2007), on the other hand, chose the title Museums and Their Communities in recognition that many museums ‘still identify the communities they wish to work with and they exercise the power to represent their communities’ (pp. 2–3; emphasis added). As a result, the relationship is ‘an unequal one, with the balance of power heavily tipped in favour of the institution’ (p. 9). Research on empowering communities shows that the divide between museums and communities is ongoing, and applying its far-reaching conclusions is aspirational for most museums (see also Karp, Kreamer, & Lavine, 1992; Peers & Brown, 2003).  Foregrounding the agency of communities vis-à-vis museums leads to scrutiny of the authority of the latter. As was outlined in the previous section, in the modernist museum, ‘[i]t was the curator as scholar, expert on the collections and knowledgeable about the relevant discipline, who led the project, chose the objects for display and decided on what to say in the text panels and labels’ (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000, p. 133). The new museology would come to critique curatorial authority as one that reflected a particular value system rather than ‘reality.’ Accordingly, choices made by museum professionals had political effects, regardless of whether museums disavowed their power or not (Marstine, 2006, pp. 5–6). Museums increasingly began to see themselves as forums rather than temples (Cameron, 1971), leading to the inclusion of voices that had been excluded from museums and the admission of multiple perspectives on their collection items. Thus, Indigenous knowledges began to be viewed as having authority equal to, or greater than, Western frameworks, leading not only to the return of cultural property but also concerted efforts to  25 ‘share authority’ with these communities and to become ‘contact zones’ where colonial relations could be renegotiated (Clifford, 1999, p. 438; Frisch, 1990).  The use of museums to present different perspectives on history and society was a considerable break from old museology. However, the consequent shift was criticised by conservative forces that continued to favour more hierarchical approaches. The controversy surrounding the 1995 Smithsonian exhibition arranged around the Enola Gay—the American aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during the Second World War—has become a central case study for museums. Critics, particularly veterans of the armed forces and conservative politicians, claimed that the exhibit gave disproportionate attention to the resulting Japanese casualties rather than the motivations behind the bombing (Thelan, 1995). Reflecting on the incident, Dubin (1999) notes in Displays of Power: Memory and Amnesia in the American Museum that ‘[m]useums have moved to the forefront in struggles over representation…[and] differ greatly from their predecessors’ (p. 5). In Australia, the presentation of Indigenous history after the opening of the NMA has become a prominent example of struggle over representation. As noted above, the founding director Dawn Casey (2001) viewed the museum as ‘a forum, a place for dialogue and debate’ (p. 6). She argued that the contested nature of Australian history means that the NMA ‘will always be “controversial”’ (p. 230) and, indeed, that ‘if we tread on a few toes, or upset a few preconceptions, we’re obviously doing our job properly’ (pp. 235–236). The remonstrations that were directed at both museums, however, illustrate the risks that attend socially and political engaged practices.  In addition to the range of orientations discussed so far—the empowerment of communities, the critique of museological authority, and the contextual nature of meanings—new museology is concerned with the politics of representation and the related ideas of diversity and inclusion (Macdonald, 2006a, p. 3). It proceeds from the history of museums outlined in the previous section, one that connects them to colonisation, racism, sexism, and classism. Museums are recognised as potent agents in presenting cultural representations that are not only reflective of society and culture but also constitutive of them (Sandell & Dodd, 2010, p. 3). Representational critiques thus aim to use the constitutive power of museums to make museums—and therefore society—‘more inclusive, more democratic, more representative…of groups linked by culture, ethnicity,  26 race, nationality, neighbourhood, sexual orientation, ability and disability’ (Krouse, 2006, p. 170). Each of these lines of difference and many others has its own sub-field of museum studies literature, with queer museology joining this critical assemblage.  Research in museum studies continues to work from principles that have been articulated since the formation of the new museology. Although concerned with the multiform differences above, arguments cohere around normative claims for human rights, social justice, equality, and inclusion. The work of the museum scholar Richard Sandell has been particularly influential and can be used to track the concerns of this literature. In the edited volume Museums, Society and Inequality, he argues that ‘[m]useums and galleries of all kinds have both the potential to contribute towards the combatting of social inequality and a responsibility to do so’ (Sandell, 2002b, p. 3), an idea reiterated in Museums, Equality and Social Justice where he observes that ‘[t]he last two decades have seen concerns for equality, diversity, social justice and human rights move from the margins of museum thinking and practice, to the core’ (Sandell & Nightingale, 2012, p. 1). In Museums, Prejudice and the Reframing of Difference, Sandell (2007a) investigates audience responses to exhibitions designed to combat prejudice. Defining the background that transformed the understood purposes of museums, he cites—among other things—the influence of human rights, multiculturalism, and social movements of the last fifty years (p. 6). His portrait of a ‘less prejudiced, more equitable society’ reiterates many new museological principles that have been discussed in this section:  Museums can enable and facilitate conversations about difference, providing a forum (and one with unique qualities) in which disputes, arising from the conflicting values held by different communities, can be addressed and explored. They can inform and (re)frame the character and substance of these conversations by offering resources – material and conceptual – which privilege concepts of social justice, which nurture respect for difference and challenge prejudice and discrimination, opening up possibilities for mutual understanding and respect (Sandell, 2007a, p. 26).  In envisioning museums that should be created, Sandell and others attempting to engender such characteristics have been charged with the ‘prescriptive turn’ in museum studies  27 (Carbonell, 2012, pp. 11–12). Indeed, Sandell (2017b) admits in Museums, Moralities and Human Rights that his view that museums should be rights arbitrators might ‘be viewed as either dangerous or deeply unfashionable’ (p. 161). However, given that museum representations have ‘implications for the ways in which human rights are experienced, continually sought and fought for, realised and refused’ (p. 6), he holds that museums should arbitrate rights claims in ways that support human rights and oppose discrimination. Witcomb’s (2003) critique of approaches that posit a ‘radical break’ with the past could also apply to research following the ‘prescriptive turn.’ Viewed in another light, this literature can be regarded as gathering examples of best practice, and suggesting ideal scenarios, in order to encourage its wider application within the museum sector. McCall & Gray (2014) argue that ‘effective implementation of the “new museology” depends on the degree to which workers themselves believe in its related values’ (p. 31). Normative arguments for inclusion and diversity might therefore lead to new norms, in turn fulfilling those claims.  The new museology has created increasing space over the last several decades to re-consider the purpose of museums, reflect on their problematic histories, and take action on their ongoing exclusions. However, the conception of diversity imagined has also involved its own limitations as the editors of Gender, Sexuality and Museums: A Routledge Reader observed in reviewing the literature:  There is consensus on the authority of museums in identity formation, but little or no attention to issues of sexual and gender identities. The predominance of material on multiculturalism and community building conceives of cultures as being constructed along racial, ethnic, and national lines; but communities built on shared sexuality or gender identification are not or cannot be imagined by these authors (Conlan & Levin, 2010, p. 308).  While consideration of LGBTIQ diversity is lacking in new museological literature, ‘not or cannot’ may be an overstatement (for example, see Levin, 2012; Liddiard, 1996; Sandell, 2017b; Sandell & Frost, 2010; Vanegas, 2002; and Winchester, 2012). Nevertheless, former director of the Migration Museum, Viv Szekeres (2007), recounts that the museum’s understanding of identity excluded sexuality, indicating ‘not only a lack of courage, but  28 also the fact that most communities who work with us prefer not to think about…the gays and lesbians who are amongst them’ (p. 260). These limitations necessitated the development of queer museology.  2.3 Queer museology: International  Queer museology pursues the new museological goals of involving and including communities but specifically focuses on the LGBTIQ dimensions of diversity. Most significant moments when individual and collective attention has been paid to the area have occurred in the last ten years in Euro-American settings. As observed by most authors, the starting point in most museums is invisibility resulting from heteronormativity (see Figure 2, pp. 3–5). The proposals to challenge the status quo are broad-ranging and differ in their emphasis on either sameness or difference from broader society, the level of involvement required of public museums, and perspectives on categorisation and labelling.  Overall features of collections of queer museological texts include their production in several national contexts and their consideration of other GLAM (gallery, library, archive, and museum) sites. Of these collections, the 2008 ‘Where is Queer?’ issue of Museums & Social Issues (Fraser & Heimlich, 2008b) and the edited collection Gender, Sexuality, and Museums (Levin, 2010) are the most influential and frequently cited, predominately containing case studies from the USA and UK. Also notable among the collections is the interest in archives as sites of queer public history, in particular through the ‘Queering Archives: Historical Unravelings’ and ‘Queering Archives: Intimate Tracings’ issues of Radical History Review (Marshall, Murphy, & Tortorici, 2014, 2015). However, these issues also include articles on museums, while other contributors displayed the same flexibility as queer community heritage organisations (QCHOs) in relation to GLAM organisations. Further works in queer museology have considered the museum alongside other sites of public history, including Interpreting LGBT History at Museums and Historic Sites (Ferentinos, 2015) and Representations of Same-Sex Love in Public History (Hayward, 2015). The emergence of collections within the last ten years builds on and extends developments that began with the new museology.   29 The starting point for the majority of queer museological literature, and for the areas of museum practice examined in the present enquiry, is the erasure or invisibility of queerness. The work on house museums, in particular, demonstrates how non-heterosexuality or ambiguous sexuality in house histories is effaced. Adair (2010) writes that ‘[t]he “straightening” of the biographical record is at the heart of house museum practice in the United States today’ (p. 265). Using the case study of the house museum Pendarvis in Wisconsin, Adair found that the topic of the relationship between the founding men was avoided; when asked, a tour guide retorted ‘I know what you are trying to ask.…And I don’t know and I don’t care’ (as cited p. 272). A similar revision was made at the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, Chicago, where the intimate partnership between Jane Addams and Mary Rozet-Smith was unacknowledged (Lee, 2011). In the latter case at least, steps have been taken to interpret the non-heterosexual relationship. Rozet-Smith’s portrait is now displayed near Addams’s bed where it had historically hung, and a label interprets their relationship from different perspectives (p. 184) (Figure 4).   Figure 4: Portrait of Mary Rozet-Smith at the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, Chicago. Image courtesy of Karissa Kessen   30 The sources agree that such erasures do not apply to heterosexuality. In the absence of discussion of non-heterosexuality or sexuality in general, heterosexuality operates as the unmarked norm, as conveyed by some of the effects of heterosexual privilege in museums (Figure 2, pp. 3–5). Writing about the discussion of relationships in regard to an artist’s life, curator Michael Petry (2010) writes that ‘heterosexual “outing”…is done so often that it hardly appears visible in its naturalness, but its opposite, same-sex love, tends to be hushed up. Institutions often remain tight-lipped, even when their complicity in enforcing a heterosexual filter is exposed’ (p. 154). Arts administration and education scholar James H. Sanders III (2008) argues that by doing so ‘the museum has (un)intentionally served as an instrument of heteronormativity’ (p. 16). Likewise, queer feminist scholar Jennifer Tyburczy (2009) observed in her doctoral study Exhibiting Sexualities: Pleasure, Power, and Performance in Sex Museums, ‘sex is everywhere in the museum, an invisible but ubiquitous celebration of heterosexuality’ (p. 233). She suggests in her concept of ‘queer curatorship’ that the method is ‘simultaneously a mode for studying how museums place objects in normative sexual relationships…and a method for experimenting with object arrangements toward the cultivation of other sexual-social relationships’ (Tyburczy, 2013, p. 15). Scholarship in queer museology exposes the double standards that apply differentially to queer material and, importantly, suggests ways they might be addressed.  The proposals for challenging heteronormativity are far-reaching, entailing the recognition of its numerous effects, and thereafter a fundamental reshaping of the museum. In this vein, subsequent chapters look at a broad cross-section of the museum organisation to suggest extensive reforms. Levin (2012) states that ‘“[q]ueering” the museum leads us to question every aspect of the institution,’ citing patriarchal values and binary gender as two issues that need to be questioned (p. 158). Mills’s (2006) conception of queering the museum is even more expansive, involving a critique of ‘the closet,’ linear progress narratives (e.g. from oppression to liberation), grand narratives, and fixed categories. He asks ‘[s]hould the queer museum contain the same kinds of things as any other museum?’ to which he answers ‘I sincerely hope not’ (pp. 261–262). Although, at face value, his suggestions might appear radically different to contemporary museum practice, in many ways they reiterate proposals developed following the new museology. It too argued for broad-sweeping reform of museums in all their areas of operation, the critique of dominant power relations, and destabilising privileged meanings. It may be open to the same critique of  31 suggesting a ‘radical break’ that is either impossible or always aspirational. Indeed, queer feminist scholar Nicole Robert (2016) poses the challenging question, ‘[h]ow, in fact, does one queer a museum, given that the very impetus of queer defies many of the logics of museum practice?’ (p. 128).  Some queer scholars and QCHOs have answered Robert’s question by seeing ‘queer’ and ‘museum’ as contradictory concepts. For gender theorist Ann Cvetkovich (2003)—author of the influential book An Archive of Feelings: Trauma, Sexuality, and Lesbian Public Cultures—‘LGBT archives are definitely queerer than museums could ever be’ (Tyburczy, 2009, p. 54). One of the major sites covered in her book, the Lesbian Herstory Archives (LHA), New York, exemplifies a defiant attitude to museums and public institutions. According to one of its founders, Joan Nestle (2015), it ‘was born in my eyes as an anticolonization project, what we called in the 1970s, lesbian separatism’ (p. 239). In this spirit, the LHA ‘take[s] no money from the government…believing that the society that rules us out of history should never be relied upon to make it possible for us to exist’ (Nestle, 1990, p. 92). Curator and journalist Hugh Ryan (2014), founder of the Pop-Up Museum of Queer History in the USA, conveys the same autonomous orientation as the LHA: ‘I wanted a space where queer people could learn queer history. I didn’t want to stroll through a great exhibition waiting for the homophobic shoe to drop.…I wanted a queer museum. So I made one’ (p. 80). QCHOs have ongoing importance—reflected in their incorporation into the framework of the thesis—as queer communities often feel that their cultural and political goals are best met through independent efforts.  In contrast to the separatism of the LHA are approaches that emphasise commonalities between queer and non-queer subjects. Karkruff (2014) argues that ‘the most successful approach may be a focus on sameness,’ which relies upon universal themes like love, family, and desire (p. 18). There is evidence that foregrounding shared experiences may be more acceptable to general museum audiences and thus avoid controversy (Sandell, 2002a, pp. 13–14). Similarly, Gabriel (2010) argues that we need to ‘stop grappling with the “queer self” as if it were the confining closet of this hyper-sexualized, adolescent, narcissistic, domineering, male body that fixates many of our social stereotypes about queerness’ (p. 76). He classifies as ‘queer junk’ the notion that ‘[q]ueerness is about us and them’ and that ‘[q]ueerness entails museum work best left to a specialized institution’ (p.  32 74). Supporting his arguments, it is the case that LGBTIQ-identified artists are wary of being confined or ‘ghettoised’ by their identities (Sandell, Dodd, & Jones, 2010, p. 47). In addition, inclusion efforts to date have focused on the spectacular over the everyday (e.g. pride festivals, drag culture, gender non-conformity, and sexual subcultures) (Vanegas, 2002, p. 99). For instance, Hide / Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture at the National Portrait Gallery in the USA and Gay Icons at the National Portrait Gallery in London centred on well-known artists and individuals, arguably reinforcing aesthetic and social hierarchies (Hayward, 2015, pp. 109–110; Katz, 2010, p. 10).  However, the pursuit of common experiences and avoiding controversy may downplay the uniqueness of queer cultures and the value of controversy in bringing important, if uncomfortable, issues into view (section 7.2: Utilising controversy). While more congenial representations of queer communities appear safer, compromises may work against the principle that communities should have primary authority over their representations. In developing the exhibition Out of Chicago at the Chicago History Museum, the curators consulted with both LGBT and non-LGBT groups. The latter wanted to emphasise that ‘they’re just like us’ whereas the former ‘insisted that we detail how LGBT people have exploded and reinterpreted the meaning of family’ (Austin, Brier, Herczeg-Konecny, & Parsons, 2012, p. 194). The museum’s administration was also successful in having reference to leather ‘daddies’ and ‘boys’—consensual role play between adults—removed as audiences might associate it with paedophilia (p. 195). On later reflection, the curators of Out of Chicago questioned whether they ‘responded by serving as our own censors’ (Austin & Brier, 2015, p. 127). Navigating the issue of sameness and difference is complex, requiring scrutiny of the direction of compromise even as connections between queer and non-queer groups are pursued (Chapter 7: Queering connections).  There are differing views in queer museology on categorisation, disagreements that centre upon its utility but also its risks. It is understandable that visibility will be a key device in responding to invisibility. ‘Coming out’—publicly declaring one’s sexuality—was and continues to be used as an effective political tool. The usefulness of the tactic has been repeated in queer museology (e.g. Mills, 2008, p. 47). At the house museum Beauport in Gloucester, Massachusetts, the museum started interpreting the former owner Henry Davis Sleeper as gay when ‘[i]n an oral history…the lover of Sleeper’s cousin identified Sleeper  33 as a gay man’ (Turino, 2015, p. 133). Leaving aside whether this evidence is sufficient to identify Sleeper as such, it is improbable that Sleeper (1878–1934) would have used this terminology. While it is argued in section 5.3 that approaching material with a queer eye is often required, the American Alliance of Museum’s Welcoming Guidelines for Museums asserts that queer connections should be drawn ‘when known (i.e. not speculative)’ (LGBTQ Alliance, 2016, p. 18). In contrast, Raker (2013) maintains that ‘[n]aming involves power, but so does not naming’ (p. 2) meaning that not strategically outing individuals—even if labels are accepted as historically specific—may lead to ongoing queer invisibility.  Relatedly, the concept of identity is a source of dispute in both identity politics and queer theory, particularly how it is able to collapse difference and create identity when claiming to merely represent it (Jagose, 1996, p. 91). Curran (2012) argues that ‘[m]useums should strive…towards the de-politicisation and de-categorisation of people’ (p. 49), a position adopted by Steorn (2012) who argues that neat categories work to restrict and exclude queer possibilities (p. 359). However, a negotiated position is adopted in the present research that deploys essentialised identities to increase queer visibility while also subjecting them to scrutiny (sections 1.1 and 5.3). Historian of gender and sexuality, Alison Oram, adopts this standpoint in her research on house museums. Focusing on two sites including Plas Newydd, former home of the Ladies of Llangollen who are famed for their same-sex intimacy (Figure 5), Oram (2011) recognises that ‘past inhabitants [of house museums] are always just a partial reflection of the present self and sexual subjectivity’ (p. 198) and further that house museums present ‘pieces of history which collide, meanings which do not add up, spaces which become odd, even queer, in all kinds of ways’ (p. 199). While wary of the simplification of outing the two women as ‘lesbians’ as some contemporary writers have done, Oram recognises that these moves to claim historical figures as ‘one of us’ were an important strategy of gay and lesbian political movements from the 1970s (p. 195) and that ‘[m]aking connections with the ghosts of the past will remain an affective [sic] and popular approach to the history of sexuality’ (p. 204).   34  Figure 5: The Ladies of Llangollen (Wellcome Library, 1828)  In contrast to the above disagreement, there is general recognition that representations should reflect the diversity of queer communities, and that they have often skewed towards ‘“respectable,” middle-class, white gay life’ (Duggan, 1995, p. 190). Transgender and intersex representation has been particularly inadequate, making programming such as April Ashley: Portrait of a Lady at the Museum of Liverpool, Mimi’s Family at the Boston Children’s Museum, and Rendering Gender at the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, especially notable (Sandell, 2017a). Insufficient attention has also been given to the interaction between different categories of experience. Queer museologist Nicole Robert (2014) in ‘Getting intersectional in museums’ applies intersectionality theory to museums—the idea that experiences of identities and identity-based oppressions intersect—cautioning ‘against the simplistic prioritizing of one identity over others…[and] advocating a systematic analysis of the ways that oppression operates’ (p. 25). Museum programming that has sought to examine intersectional LGBTIQ identities includes Made in God’s Image at the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow (on relationships of LGBTI people to religion) and A Changing America: 1968 and Beyond at the National Museum of African  35 American History and Culture in the USA (a permanent exhibit that includes LGBTIQ people of colour) (DiGuglielmo, 2016; Innes, 2009). These intersectional exhibitions build bridges across the queer / non-queer divide and contrast with the community-focused activities of QCHOs. An intersectional approach is later adopted in analysing the diversity of queer exhibitions in Australia to date (section 6.2.6).  The activities of QCHOs do not necessarily lead to insular representations that are un-attuned to intersectional diversity, as literature on the Schwules Museum, Berlin, and the GLBT History Museum, San Francisco, shows. As museums started by LGBTIQ communities that have adopted museum conventions—commonly cited as the only two permanent LGBTIQ museums in the world (though see Appendix D)—they are influenced by both QCHO and public museum approaches. The Schwules Museum (Gay Museum) was founded by four gay men in 1986 though it continues to diversify its programming such as opening the exhibition lesbian.jewish.gay [sic] in 2013 and expanding its lesbian inclusion in the permanent exhibition Self Confidence and Persistence – 200 Years of History (Ridinger, 2010, p. 174; Schwules Museum, 2009). The museum also collaborated with the German Historical Museum, Berlin, in 2015 to co-develop Homosexuality_ies that opened concurrently at both sites, ‘a huge political step…[t]hat will bring the history of same-sex love to a much wider audience’ (Hayward, 2015, p. 147). Similarly, GLBT History Museum curator Don Romesburg (2014) recognises that care is needed to prevent its activities ‘[v]eer[ing] towards those most likely to have the space, time and sense of entitlement to claim a place in history—often well-connected white, gay men’ (35). The introductory panel of its permanent exhibition Our Vast Queer Past: Celebrating San Francisco’s GLBT History is also concerned with building connections between LGBTIQ people and wider society: the exhibition narratives ‘reflect deeply human themes: the search for companionship and pleasure; the struggle for self-determination and respect…; the value of individual and collective expression; and the spirit, ingenuity and wit that have been keys to our survival’ (Koskovich, 2014, p. 69). Moreover, it too collaborates with public institutions (Mazaris, 2010, pp. 105–106). Even as both museums maintain sites that could be said to emphasise the difference of queer communities, they use their independence to build connections within and outside the community. This thesis presents its own case for effective ways of navigating the tensions between queer communities and public museums (e.g. sections 6.2.2 to 6.2.4 and section 7.3).  36  A final point that is observed throughout queer museological literature is the temporariness of queer interventions in museums. Even though there are major events that briefly queer institutions—like Ars Homo Erotica that took up half of the National Museum in Warsaw, Poland (Leszkowicz, 2012)—there is agreement that queer inclusion ‘remains highly uneven with pockets of innovation and experimentation among widespread wariness, uncertainty, ambivalence and disinterest’ (Sandell & Frost, 2010, p. 151). The Swedish Exhibition Agency (2016) that drew upon consultation with international and Swedish museum scholars and professionals also came to a similar conclusion in its report Museums and LGBTQ (p. 57). Others have considered ways to produce more lasting impacts. Vincent (2014) in LGBT People and the UK Cultural Sector: The Response of Libraries, Museums, Archives and Heritage since 1950, among many other suggestions for LGBT inclusion in the cultural sector, advises that sustaining interventions can be achieved through a cross-organisation approach involving management, staff, volunteers, and communities (p. 119). Tseliou (2013b) also identified temporariness as a major limitation of queer inclusion so far and argued that museums should ‘interweave sexual minorities’ stories into mainstream museum narratives’ (p. 8).  Queer museology is a field that has largely developed over the last ten years in Euro-American settings including the USA, UK, Poland, Germany, and Sweden. It has brought together historians, activists, and museum theorists and practitioners to consider what museums can offer queer communities and vice versa. There is general agreement on the invisibility of queerness, the operation of heteronormativity across museum organisations, the lack of attention to diverse and everyday experiences, and the temporariness of inclusive efforts. However, disagreements familiar before the emergence of the field have been reiterated in the museum context, disagreements centring on the role that public museums should play, whether to emphasise sameness or difference, and the utility and risks of categorisation. The present enquiry develops its own strategies regarding these issues.     37 2.4 Queer museology: Australia  The growth of queer museology in Australia has been uneven with periods of (in)activity and limited consideration of the museum organisation beyond collections and exhibitions. While it reflects many of the same discussions as those internationally—the status quo of general invisibility, the concern with diversity, and the importance of QCHOs—it bears specificities that follow from the particular histories of queer communities in Australia and the organisations they have created.  The only significant collection of works in queer museology in Australia was the February 1999 ‘Now That’s a Queer Notion’ issue of Museum National, the magazine of the peak professional body Museums Australia (now Museums Galleries Australia). It was guest edited by GLAMA (the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Museums Australia), a special interest group within Museums Australia. The issue was an important moment when the Australian museum industry appraised its engagements with queer communities. In the introductory essay, the editors discussed the genesis of the Gay & Lesbian Policy Guidelines for Museum Programs and Practice (Museums Australia, 1999). It presaged some of the issues that are still current including ensuring accountability of the museum industry to inclusion policies, potential controversy that results from queer subjects, and also the breadth of change that must occur for museums to become more inclusive. On the latter, Kronenberg stated that ‘if you adopt seriously a policy such as the gay and lesbian policy…it means a fundamental shift in the way that the museum actually sees itself’ (Swieca, Kronenberg, & Dolan, 1999, p. 5).  Other contributions to the journal issue importantly centred on perspectives from community organisations and members of LGBTIQ communities. Jonathan Parsons (1999), festival director of Mardi Gras, outlined the collaboration between community organisations like Mardi Gras and public museums in Sydney including the Powerhouse Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Australian Museum. Ford and Isaac (1999) reflected on curating the exhibition Forbidden Love – Bold Passion: An Exhibition of Lesbian Stories 1900s–1990s, recounting homophobic comments as well as resistance from museums that refused to host the travelling exhibition. Gay historian Garry Wotherspoon (1999) picked up on the theme of controversy when he argued that there is  38 value to being provocative in order to allow public validation of gay and lesbian lives. The articles took stock of the nascent attempts by public museums to engage with queerness at that point, the barriers against queer representation in the 1990s, and the independent efforts of LGBTIQ communities to have their lives accepted within broader society. There have been no subsequent issues from the peak museum professional body dedicated to LGBTIQ subjects.  The rest of the Australian literature on queer museology consists of individual works broadly concerned with collections or exhibitions, often starting from the observation that LGBTIQ representation is lacking. The report of the Victorian ‘Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Material Survey’ disseminates the results of the only cross-collection LGBTIQ collection survey undertaken in Australia. Authored by the historian Kate Davison (2006), the survey began when the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives (ALGA) approached Museum Victoria to support the search for relevant material across Victorian collections. Among the innovations of the project was the methodology developed to search for material within the collection that increased the number of ‘gay and lesbian’ objects in the Museum Victoria database from 9 to 148. Davison (2011) drew on her findings in the article ‘Agents of Social Change? LGBT Voices in Australian Museums’ where she placed the survey in the context of the museological shift towards becoming ‘agents of social change’ and further expanded upon the methodological issues encountered during the project. Davison’s research will be discussed in section 5.4 as a productive way of increasing queer visibility within museum collections.  Viewing LGBTIQ exhibitions within the wider field of gay and lesbian public history, human geographer Andrew Gorman-Murray (2004) notes that ‘there have been few exhibitions of Australian gay public history in museums, and heritage sites often fail to report on gay sexualities even at sites of known and documented homosexuality’ (p. 21). Therefore, opportunities have been lost for museums to legitimise LGBTIQ identities and position them within a shared national history (p. 9). He continues the critical evaluation of queer exhibitions in the article ‘So, Where Is Queer? A Critical Geography of Queer Exhibitions in Australia’ (Gorman-Murray, 2008). Analysing 27 exhibitions noted by GLAMA, he concludes that ‘regional histories are few, national and state scale histories are prevalent, and minimal exhibitions occur outside metropolitan areas’ (p. 67). Gorman- 39 Murray’s geographic approach is a useful way to extend the assessment of representation beyond sexuality to the ways that location influences access and inclusion. His analysis of the diversity of Australian exhibition is extended in section 6.2.6 using an increased data set of 131 exhibitions (see Appendix C: Queer exhibitions in Australia, 1977–2016).  The recognition that exhibitions can participate in the support of communities and identities is also evidenced in the reflections of the following three Australian curators. Interestingly, all are self-identified lesbian women, showing the interweaving of the personal, political, and professional. Cultural researcher Sharon Chalmers (2007), curator of Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney at Liverpool Regional Museum, Sydney, reflected on the issues of representing people who live at multiple margins. Looking back on the exhibition Prejudice and Pride: Recognising the Contribution of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Communities to Brisbane, Carol Low (2016) asked ‘[c]an we really use the spaces of museums to subvert the status quo and effect change?’ (p. 228). Ultimately, she answered in the affirmative but with an awareness that LGBTIQ inclusion can only happen in favourable social and political conditions. Pushing the boundaries of social history in museums, the artist / curator Jo Darbyshire (2003a, 2003b) reinterpreted the collection of the Western Australian Museum in The Gay Museum: An Exhibition Exploring the History of Lesbian and Gay Presence in Western Australia. Her production of surprising and provocative new meanings has led to considerable critical attention (Barrett & Millner, 2014, pp. 87–91; Karkruff, 2014, p. 30; Mills, 2008, p. 49). Case studies of two projects—Edges in section 7.4 and Prejudice and Pride in section 6.2.2—are undertaken to examine collaborations between queer communities and public museums.  QCHOs like ALGA have been central to the production of queer exhibitions. Historian Graham Willett (2011b), former president of ALGA, evaluates the exhibitions within the wider context of queer public history, a history sustained by queer communities: ‘Queer history comes into the universities through people embedded in the movements and community and it survives and thrives chiefly as a form of public rather than academic history’ (pp. 6–7). As organisations that sidestep public institutions, QCHOs are fundamental to investigating the tensions between museums and queer communities. ALGA is run by volunteers using funds from donations and its membership. Its collection comprises archival material and a small range of objects including unusual items like dildo  40 moulds (Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, 2013, p. 28). It also conducts queer history walks around Melbourne, inaugurated the annual Australian Homosexual Histories Conference series, and has produced or contributed material to more exhibitions than any public institution in Australia. In 2016 alone, it contributed material to seven exhibitions including Memories of the Struggle: Australians against Apartheid at the Museum of Australian Democracy, Canberra (Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, 2016a, p. 10). According to the founding president Graham Carbery (1995a), ALGA was a ‘creation of the Gay Liberation era, having been established in 1978’ (p. 30), and he warned that ‘the gay and lesbian archive communities would be unwise to entrust the preservation of its historical record to the benevolence of the state’ (p. 34).  A more complex orientation towards public institutions exists today. Willett (2012) in considering ‘How small collections can make a big difference’ expounds ALGA’s unique contributions, though is pragmatic about accepting support from public institutions: ‘the work of community-based archives and other collections is of national significance, and we should celebrate what we do and be proud of it and not be backward in expecting national / state / local institutions to support our work.’ Similar examples of support include success, on a number of occasions, in securing funds through the National Library of Australia’s (2016) ‘Community Heritage Grants’ programme. Another former president of ALGA Daniel Marshall (2011) argues against the ‘narrow, reformist path’ used by contemporary advocates for adoption of LGBTIQ material in school curricula and health programmes, instead imagining the radical potential that archives have as a site of pedagogy (pp. 37–38). ALGA illustrates that queer communities will sustain their histories on their own terms regardless of the interest of public institutions. As with community archives established following ‘new left, anti-racist or identity politics of the 1960s onwards,’ ALGA is committed to ‘self-help and self-determination’ (Flinn & Stevens, 2009, p. 6). The continual formation of QCHOs from the 1970s into the 2000s (Appendix D) illustrates that their close connection of history, identity making, and community building is still valued.  As seen above, most research in queer museology in Australia has focused on collections and exhibitions. My master’s dissertation Towards a Queer Intersectional Museology attempted a broader analysis by looking across several areas of museum practice to explore possibilities for greater queer inclusion (Nguyen, 2013), and was said to have ‘[raised] a  41 clarion call to the profession for museums to be queer allies’ (Simpson, 2013, p. 2). It began by establishing a theoretical framework that was indebted to queer studies and intersectionality, then undertook a case study of QCHOs and public museums, before meditating on the issues that arise when approaching queer history. Similar to the present enquiry, it navigated the competing objectives of queer communities and museums. It strategically used the inclusionist and identity-based framework of museums under the premise that expanding the envelope of inclusion necessarily calls into question their heteronormative foundations. The dissertation was criticised in Ritchie (2015), Queering Museums: Questions of Space, Affect, and the (Non)Normative for its orientation to museums. Using the Canadian Museum of Human Rights as a case study, and in reviewing museum studies writings including my dissertation, the author argues that all submit to the normalising logic of museums:  I argue that the turn to LGBTQ representation within museology is representative of the turn to recognizing identitarian selves within the larger cohesive whole. This initial turn to LGBTQ* [sic] representation has, I argue, demonstrated a reliance on incorporation and normalization, disciplining such representation according to the dominant structure of museology (p. 49)  In critiquing supposed submission to normativity in museum studies, Ritchie seeks to ‘contribute to the potential of shifting and improving museological practice, demonstrating new theoretical connections and grounds for considering differently’ (p. 17). While that is a commendable enterprise, this thesis maintains that queer museology can be effective when it adopts the language and conventions of museums in order to push them in more inclusive and diverse directions.  Reviewing the Australian literature in queer museology reveals significant gaps, especially compared with the international literature. The momentum for consideration of LGBTIQ diversity in museums peaked in the late 1990s with the publication of the Gay & Lesbian Policy Guidelines for Museum Programs and Practice and a related issue in Museum National. Since then, the sparse literature consists of reflections on exhibition and collection development. However, the strength of the literature lies in its connection with queer communities including articles produced by lesbian-identified curators, queer  42 individuals and allies in GLAMA, and members of queer community heritage organisations like ALGA. The current enquiry continues the new museological concerns with inclusion and diversity. Moreover, it expands on queer museological research within Australia, examining a broad cross-section of the museum organisation—management, collections, exhibitions, and internal and external connections—to consider barriers and enablers of further queer inclusion.  2.5 Conclusion  Although new museology involves a range of orientations that are still aspirational in many museums, the changes that have occurred since its development illustrate that museums can be reshaped. Queer museology continues in this critical tradition, extending it in order to fulfil the new museological aims of empowering communities and contributing to their equitable inclusion. Despite the rapid growth of literature in the area internationally, research produced in an Australian context is relatively scarce compared with Euro-American settings. In addition, work that considers multiple areas of the museum organisation, while engaging with museological language and conventions, is lacking. As a meeting point between museums and queer communities, the field has reiterated critiques from both sources including representational critiques and resistance to heteronormativity. Yet, because they are distinct entities with divergent interests, disagreements are inevitable which are reflected in queer museology. For the communities, division may emanate from the perception that museums still operate in the old museological mode, and due to the desire to maintain the distinctiveness of their cultures. For museums, addressing these changes may appear to require radical changes that they are unwilling or unable to implement.  While recognising that the perspectives of museums and queer communities are sometimes incommensurable, the thesis seeks to foreground their common concerns as a basis for future collaboration. The literature review revealed examples of museum practice where queer inclusion was pursued with varying degrees of success. It will be advanced, looking at Australian case studies across museum organisations, that queer inclusion is encouraged when mutual understanding and accommodation between museum and communities is attempted. Towards this end, the concerns of the latter are articulated through the goals of  43 the new museology. Simultaneously, the agency of communities is foregrounded including when they choose to disengage from museums. The problem of how to navigate these competing strands and enable further queer inclusion remains.  44 3 Methodology  How can the voices of those who are oppressed, discriminated against, unrecognized, excluded, or inaccurately represented be brought into the research process in a way that furthers social justice and human rights? (Mertens, Fraser, & Heimlich, 2008, p. 91).  This thesis addresses the problem of how queer or LGBTIQ communities can be further included in Australian museums on their own terms, examining the areas of management, collections, exhibitions, and relationships with communities and audiences. The research problem was defined in section 1.1 including a justification for selecting these operational areas, while the previous chapter identified the dearth of queer museological research in the Australian context that looked holistically at the museum organisation. The present chapter will elaborate on the methodology that seeks to capture the ‘voices of those who are oppressed, discriminated against, unrecognized’ through case studies of queer-inclusive projects involving museums. Feeding into these case studies are semi-structured interviews, archival material, and secondary literature. First, justification will be given for the use of case studies, with reference to the methodological literature. One of those sources, semi-structured interviews, will be discussed in detail, including the selection of the interview questions and subsequent use of the material, my positionality in relation to the interviewees, limitations, and ethical issues.  3.1 Case studies  In Case Study Research: Design and Methods, Yin (2003) states that ‘case studies are the preferred strategy when “how” and “why” questions are being posed’ (p. 1). Among the strengths of case studies are the incorporation of real world detail as well as the ability to integrate ‘multiple sources of evidence, with data needing to converge in a triangulating fashion’ (p. 14). It is therefore the most appropriate method to approach the enquiry. First, as a ‘how’ question is being posed, case studies allow for the exploration of the tangible ways in which queer-inclusive projects have occurred. Articulated as these projects are through the specificities of each museum and community group, case studies provide real- 45 world examples that convey the complexities of attempting to increase queer inclusion in museums. Second, the ability to incorporate multiple sources—interviews, archival material, observations, and secondary scholarship—is essential to the project. As was shown in the review of relevant Australian literature in queer museology (see section 2.4), there are relatively few sources that deal specifically with LGBTIQ inclusion in museums, a gap that necessitates undertaking primary research through case studies in order to extend the existing literature. In particular, interviews with those involved in relevant projects are central to investigating initiatives that may not have written documentation, which is particularly the case with community-based projects. In order to obtain a more comprehensive account, secondary literature, archival records, and observations of the outcomes where possible (e.g. attending the exhibition) contribute to the body of research material. The available sources vary between projects: some have been subject to extensive written commentary and have comprehensive archival material available; others, however, can only be recalled from memory or may have an exhibition catalogue remaining (or less).  Lack of documentation does not necessarily mean the project is less significant. Again, given that many of the projects with less written documentation are community-based, to exclude projects on this basis would skew the research towards public institutional material, thus veering away from the interest in comparing queer community and public museum contexts. Using multiple sources of information also allows the triangulation of data. According to a prominent account of triangulation, there exists several types: data triangulation, investigator triangulation, and theory triangulation (Denzin, 1989, pp. 236–241). As data are being triangulated, this methodology allows the comparison of different accounts offered by, for example, archival records of a museum versus the verbal evidence given by a community group. In this situation, triangulating data sources might assist in clarifying details or reveal the different perspectives of museums and communities.  The body of evidence available for triangulation also has a bearing on whether single- or multiple-case designs are chosen. In the single-case approach, individual projects or organisations are discussed in-depth which requires a comprehensive body of evidence. In addition, it is the preferred approach when the case can perform a critical test on a theory, when the subject is a unique or representative case, or when the case is suited to a longitudinal analysis, that is, examined at multiple points in time (Yin, 2003, pp. 40–42).  46 For instance, an in-depth single case study is conducted in section 7.4 ‘Contact zones and constraints,’ putting sources from a single exhibition in critical conversation with ‘contact zone’ theory. The focus on the Victorian Material Survey (section 5.4) is applied because it is a unique case, being the only cross-collection LGBTIQ material survey in Australia. Particular organisations are also discussed at multiple points in the thesis as they illustrate continuity of social or queer inclusion through time (e.g. the History Trust of South Australia, sections 6.2.2 and 7.2), or demonstrate a historical contrast between past and current queer-inclusive activities (e.g. the Australian Museum, sections 4.1 and 4.2).  Due to the lack of available sources, including the lack of gathered evidence through interviews, other sections of the thesis take a multiple-case approach. While the resulting analysis provides less detail on individual projects and organisations, it can also expand the generalisability of the findings given that it draws upon more examples (Yin, 2003, p. 53). Thus, sections such as 4.4 ‘Employment and networking’ and 5.5 ‘oral history’ use a multiple-case approach as there have been no studies or programs regarding the LGBTIQ diversity of museum workers in Australia, nor is there significant use of queer oral histories in museums despite their importance to queer historical scholarship. These sections are intended to survey the limited cases so far and offer potential directions for future research and practice. In other areas where a multiple-case approach are used, particularly chapter 6 ‘Queering exhibitions,’ a broad survey approach is considered more suitable for the enquiry. Surveying and evaluating the 131 queer exhibitions opened between 1977 and 2016 (Appendix C) is intended as a valuable contribution to queer museum studies. Across the thesis, then, there is a mix of in-depth, single-case discussions and also analyses that survey multiple cases, conferring depth and breadth to the overall research.   Case studies are widely adopted in museum studies and queer museology despite their potential limitations. Yin (2003) addresses the critique ‘that they provide little basis for scientific generalization. “How can you generalize from a single case?” is a frequently heard question.…The short answer is that case studies, like experiments, are generalizable to theoretical positions and not to populations or universes’ (p. 10). One response, as discussed above, is to compare multiple cases to see whether the suggestions they offer are congruent. Where appropriate, international comparisons are offered if they suggest effective practices that could be applied in Australia or, conversely, highlight favourable  47 practices that have occurred in Australia. For example, the different funding and governance frameworks in the USA and UK are used in section 4.3 to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of these national settings. It is not possible (nor would it be desirable) to propose universal propositions for queer-inclusive practices. The case studies in the thesis offer suggestions for practice that need to be adapted to the social and organisational contexts in which they are applied. In other instances, different case studies suggest different approaches to queer inclusion. Here, it is up to the museum professionals, activists, individual organisations, and community workers to decide what is the most suitable strategy for their situations. Overall, despite its limitations, the strength of the case study method in offering tangible suggestions for future practice accounts for its extensive use in museum studies (e.g. Dodd, Jones, Sawyer, & Tseliou, 2012; Sandell, 2007a, 2017b; Witcomb, 2003), as well as in most theses in queer museology (Aust, 2014; Hayward, 2015; Lehner, 2008; Mazaris, 2010; Olivo, 2015; Qu, 2012; Ritchie, 2015; Robert, 2009; Tseliou, 2013b; Tyburczy, 2009).  3.2 Semi-structured interviews and ethics  As stated above, interviews are central to the case studies as they assist in filling the gap in queer museology on Australian projects, and balance museum sources with perspectives from queer communities. In this section, justification will be given for the semi-structured interview approach, a rationale offered for the interview guide (Appendix B), the negotiation of relationships with interviewees will be explained, and a discussion of the ethical issues and limitations will be undertaken.  For semi-structured interviews, researchers develop an interview guide of either specific questions or a list of topics; during the interview they may refer to the guide or follow the flow of the conversation (Ayres, 2012). Flick (2002) expands on the ad hoc nature of semi-structured interviews which can lead to the researcher changing the order of questions, deciding that a question has already been answered in part or in full, choosing to depart from the guide in order to ask follow-up questions, or directing the interviewee back to the guide (p. 92). Flick further explains that ‘[t]he advantage of this method is that the consistent use of an interview guide increased the comparability of the data’ (p. 92), mitigating the critique that generalising from case studies is difficult. The interview guide  48 (Appendix B) groups questions under headings that correspond to chapters of the thesis and thereby to functional areas of museums. As the background of interviewees might logically suggest focusing on one of these groupings—for example, interviewing a museum director suggests concentrating on management—the interview guide was adapted to suit the projects associated with the interviewees. It allowed interviews to adapt to the specificities of queer-inclusive activities at the same time as permitting comparability to other interviews focusing on similar topics.  The interview guide and methodology were approved by the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (project number 2014/623). After a literature review was conducted to survey queer-inclusive projects in Australia, the organisations and individuals involved were invited to participate in the study. General managers of public museums and QCHOs were sent an expression of interest; they were asked to forward the Participant Information Statement and Consent Form to the interviewees. It meant that all interviewees received permission from their organisations to participate, reducing the risk of any negative repercussions resulting from being interviewed. The interviewee was asked to nominate a date and time for the interviews, though it was requested to meet at the organisation if the project to be discussed was current. Funding was obtained to travel to their locations to conduct the interviews in person. In several cases, in person interviewing allowed for guided tours of the organisation and access to working documents. After clarifying any points of the Participant Information Statement and Consent Form, signatures were taken, and the recorded interviews typically lasted 60–90 minutes.  The interviewees were selected to discuss a mix of projects in community and public settings geographically distributed across Australia. Of the 25 individuals who were interviewed: seven were involved with projects produced in-house by a public cultural institution; seven were external curators who were brought in to produce an exhibition for a public institution; three where involved in exhibitions produced and opened in community-based contexts; three participated in collaborative projects between museum and community organisations that were not exhibitions; three were LGBTIQ-identified individuals working in a public cultural organisation; four were LGBTIQ historians; and five were community workers, volunteers, and activists. Additionally, twelve were involved with projects that were based in New South Wales, six from Victoria, three from South  49 Australia, two from Queensland, one from the Australian Capital Territory, and one from the Northern Territory. This geographic skew towards New South Wales and Victoria, and their capital cities Sydney and Melbourne in particular, reflects available documentation for relevant LGBTIQ projects in Australia (see section 6.2.1 ‘Selection criteria’ and section 6.2.6 ‘Diversity’). However, it also results from limitations of the enquiry that might be addressed in future research (section 8.1). After the interviews, transcripts were produced, themes were identified, and quotations were incorporated into written discussions. If participants specified that they wished to review usage of the material before publication, the written discussion was sent to them for approval. Although suggestions were given as a result, no major modifications or withdrawals from the study occurred.  Limitations of the interview process include lack of access to some interviewees and organisations. Due to scheduling issues or unwillingness to participate in the study, various potential participants declined to be involved. While one of the strengths of the case study methodology is that archival material, observations, and secondary literature could generate sufficient research materials to discuss the project, others were not discussed because of lack of material. In addition, as in person interviewing was favoured, and due to the national scope of the study, funding could not be obtained to travel to all the locations of the interviewees. In these instances, a common meeting point was organised (for example, through conferences, and personal and professional travel) or video conference or email interviews were conducted (two were conducted in this way). Although online interviews did not allow direct observation of the organisation, they still assembled valuable research material.  Two ethical issues were anticipated: the risk of outing participants, and of evoking negative feelings through using the term ‘queer.’ While all interviewees were associated with queer-inclusive projects through publicly available documentation, there remained the risk that the thesis would reveal the information to new audiences. All interviewees accepted such risk in agreeing to the consent form. The second issue was raised by the ethics committee regarding adverse reactions to the term ‘queer,’ a derogatory term that has been reclaimed by some activists and scholars (section 1.1). In response, potential objections were turned into a point of enquiry by adding the following to the beginning of the interview guide: ‘I use the term “queer” but this is often expressed as LGBTIQ or other ways. What is your  50 preferred term? What is your understanding of these terms?’ If there was ongoing discomfort, the interview would be stopped and the interviewee asked if they wished to continue.  While the risk that the interviewee might share details that they would not want re-published had to be considered, the interpersonal context of the interview was also one of its strengths. Here, my position as a researcher comes to the fore. As a gay / queer-identified, Vietnamese-Australian, cis-man (non-transgender man), my enquiry is at once personal, political, and professional; I am an ‘interpretive bricoleur [who] understands that research is an interactive process shaped by his or her [sic] own personal history, biography, gender, social class, race, and ethnicity, and by those people in the setting’ (Denzin & Lincoln, 2008, p. 8). Most of the interviewees also shared in common an imbrication of their personal, professional, and political lives whether they were LGBTIQ-identified or not, usually allowing me to develop a rapport. Sometimes, the interviewee would indicate that certain statements were off the record, in which case they were not used in my written discussions. If it was thought that potentially sensitive information had been offered, those statements would be cleared before being used. While standard ethical practice, it is particularly important when researching marginalised communities and has therefore often been emphasised in the literature on queer methodologies. This literature has further imagined the political potential of the researcher-researched bonds that may be encouraged:  The tethering of the researcher to their researched (and equally vice versa) through the bonds of intimacy creates a political space – or ethical terrain – that binds one to the other. It is in this binding that new kinds of alternative social worlds are formed and defended (Detamore, 2010, p. 181).  It was evident that the interviewees held similar ideas of the ‘alternative social worlds’ that museums might encourage, ones where museums participate in valuing queerness as part of the overall diversity of society. Creating such bonds of researcher-researched intimacy could assist in forming a ‘community of practice’ of museum professionals, researchers, activists, and community members who share a commitment to inclusive practice (Kelly &  51 Gordon, 2002). Communicating the work of these individuals and organisations is done to draw others into the conversation on increasing queer inclusion in museums.  52 4 Queering management  Museums are complex social organisations composed of intertwined layers of routines, obligations, schedules and competing interests that frequently inhibit prompt or consistent responses to new initiatives (Ames, 2000, p. 85).  Effective museum management is the process of directing the complexity that Ames identifies towards valued goals (Holmes & Hatton, 2008, p. 12). In this chapter, the success in balancing the interests of multiple stakeholders—funding bodies, the museum profession, and queer and non-queer communities—is evaluated according to the priority given to social and queer inclusion. Queering management leads to a consistent consideration of queer diversity across museum organisations, requiring examination of the formal and informal factors that affect operations including legislation, government and museum policies, boards of trustees, mission and value statements, and the cultures and conventions of museum workers. The precedence given to social and queer inclusion is tied to broader trends within the museum sector, and evidence will be presented which shows that increasing financial constraints have placed pressures on ethical enterprises. However, the case studies of leadership from individuals and organisations show that inclusion work can still be pursued amid constraints.  To give an outline of managerial changes in Australian museums since the 1980s, the initial two sections will examine the Australian Museum (AM), the first to consider the regimes of accountability that have since transformed museums, and the second to argue that effective leadership can use the tools of management to pursue social and queer inclusion. Policy is an integral element in encouraging more widespread inclusive practices. As will be seen in the next section, however, the weak policy environment in Australia still relies on the initiative of a small corner of the museum profession. It is suggested that supporting these individuals through employment and networking forums is required (section 4.4). The final section looks at the challenge faced by museums in justifying these activities as part of their core mission. The ‘public value’ framework is promising on this front but its influence has been limited. The issues discussed in the chapter affect museum organisations and the  53 sector as a whole, and hence all the subsequent chapters. Therefore, queering management is integral to museums remaining socially valuable institutions.  4.1 Tying management to a mission  Museums in Australia have undergone dramatic changes since their establishment in the nineteenth century. Since the 1980s, this has been partly driven by ‘managerialism’ which ‘centres around importing a business-type model of governance and operation from the private sector, introducing a regime of accountability and performance management based on measurement of performance indicators and targets’ (Tlili, 2008, p. 9), mirroring upward trends of economic rationalism in museums in the USA and UK (Stallabrass, 2013, p. 149). The current section will contrast past and recent management of the AM to argue that mounting financial constraints on museums have placed pressure on all museum functions including social and queer inclusion activities; and further that the tools of management can support rather than hinder these activities. The AM provides the longest continuous history of a museum in Australia, and presents a comprehensive record of changes in museum management. It is also one of the few examples of a large public museum that has pursued queer inclusion in Australia, if only temporarily.  When the AM, Sydney, was established as the first state museum in the country in 1827, it was funded and administered directly by the colonial government. Its first custodian William Holmes, appointed as a zoologist and sole employee, is typical of appointments of the time made according to scientific credentials rather than abilities to administer an organisation (Branagan, 1979, p. 8); management and governance of museums into the 1960s was commonly based on knowledge of the museum’s specialisations (Griffin & Paroissien, 2011, p. 10). Characteristic of other nineteenth century colonial museums, the AM’s overarching priority was developing and researching its natural history and anthropological collections which, in turn, might offer scientific and economic benefits (Blainey, 1979, p. ii; Gregory-Kohlstedt, 1983). Even so, a degree of public access was available since the beginning of the museum: in 1830, it was stated that visitors could view ‘a beautiful Collection of Australian curiosities…between the hours of ten and three…to any respectable individuals who may think fit to call’ (cited in Strahan, 1979, p. 11). While the late nineteenth century consolidated the museum’s role in public instruction, these  54 ‘were mainly lectures, a one-way, passive process limited moreover, by the time that busy scientists could spare from their other demanding duties’ (McDonald, 1979, p. 152). The hierarchy that placed scholarly enterprise at the peak of the museum’s mission continued for much of the twentieth century. Even annual reports of the AM into the 1980s continued to be dominated by statements from the museum’s numerous scientific departments with an emphasis on contributions to scientific and anthropological knowledge. Until this time, broad relevance to communities outside of science remained a marginal concern.  The directorship of Des Griffin (1976–1998)—appointed initially as assistant curator of marine invertebrates—saw an expansion of non-scientific areas including exhibitions, community relations, and education. The shift was reflected in the museum’s organisational structure and continues today where the ‘Programs, Exhibitions, and Cultural Collections’ department exists alongside managerial, education, and marketing and communications divisions (Australian Museum, 2016b). Although trained as a scientist, Griffin (2017; personal communication) took interest in the effective management of museums, leading him to undertake extensive empirical research on the topic (Griffin, 1987, 1988, 1991; Griffin & Abraham, 2007; Griffin, Abraham, & Crawford, 1999). Management reforms under Griffin’s directorship include the introduction and regular review of corporate strategic plans from 1976, increase in corporate sponsorship, use of audience research to evaluate activities, and commercialisation of some museum services. The changes were partly a response to the declining recurrent funding from the NSW State Government—82% of operating costs in 1975, 76% in 1978, and 70% in 1981 (Australian Museum, 1981, p. 11)—but, in addition, were moves towards greater accountability to communities. Museum scholar and practitioner Claire Baddeley (2013), who has undertaken the most comprehensive research on changes to museum management in Australia during this period, ties them explicitly to the new museology:  The new museology has signalled a shift in museological philosophy; a moving away from traditional notions of museums as places of preservation, collections and exhibitions, towards a market-driven and audience centred approach to museum management (p. 218).   55 That is, rather than the introduction of management and business practices being antithetical to the principles of the new museology, their introduction at the AM was attendant to the social and philosophical re-evaluations that were occurring. It is now acknowledged that a ‘wide ranging set of business and management skills are those that are most needed now and in the immediate future for museums’ (BOP Consulting & The Museum Consultancy, 2016, p. 3). While decreasing public funding of museums towards ‘user pay’ models should be rigorously questioned, the adaptations under Griffin were both necessary and, importantly, guided by a recognition of the museum’s intrinsic value. Griffin (2016a, interview) attributes the success of the period of reform to ‘having a clear view of what values you stand for, having a clear view about what the organisation is there for and that never “the organisation is there to make money”…but a genuine adding value to the community.’ Indeed, formal statements of mission and philosophy begin to guide annual reports and corporate plans from 1980 (Australian Museum, 1980). According to museum director Nina Simon (2016), such statements are an institution’s ‘clearest statement of purpose.…You use it as a rudder. It helps you know which way to turn in the storm of possibilities’ (p. 122). The 1989–90 Annual Report in particular can be singled out for combining managerial techniques with forceful claims of social relevance. At the same time that state-mandated Key Performance Indicators were introduced in 1989 to ‘reflect new commitments to effective and efficient management,’ the mission statement was changed from passively ‘encourag[ing] understanding’ to ‘be[ing] a catalyst in changing public attitudes’ (Australian Museum, 1990, p. 5). It reflected broader trends in public service agencies across Australia, especially following the introduction of performance measurements by the federal government in 1984 (Lin, 2012, p. 60). Griffin in his ‘Director’s Statement’ further signalled an active stance by recounting ‘[t]wo events this year [that] startled some museum watchers,’ the first being the release of a statement to governments, businesses, and community organisations that ‘[w]e must come to terms with the cultural diversity of Australia including Aboriginal people and their justifiable claim for treatment in the framework of natural social justice’ (Australian Museum, 1990, p. 10); the second was the release of a report concerning the South East forest of NSW recommending the expansion of conservation areas and exclusion of logging (p. 10). Griffin’s tenure marks a highpoint in the AM’s efforts at social justice and participation in public debates.   56 In some ways, the succeeding directorships of Michael Archer (1999–2004), Frank Howarth (2004–2014), and Kim McKay (2014–present) were a continuation of trends that started during the Griffin years: the museum self-generates 26.8% of its revenue which is similar to figures for the past three decades (Australian Museum, 2016a, p. 6). In line with the museum sector overall, AM continues increasingly to seek out sources of non-government revenue including ‘retail, food services, facility rentals, public and educational programs, fundraising events, membership, other earned sources, private support (donations and sponsorship) [and] endowment / investment’ (Silberberg & Lord, 2015, p. 165). Also marking a continuation, the management techniques from the corporate sector introduced in the 1980s have become standard across government-funded bodies. Indeed, there has been an intensification of these trends, especially following the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 that led to severe scrutiny on government spending.9 The curtailment of funds had started decades prior, however, particularly through the use of ‘efficiency dividends’ from 1987 that required government-funded bodies to find savings to cover reductions in funds.10 They are significantly responsible for the yearly decline of funding to Australian federal museums (Figure 6), with similar declines in NSW (Barneveld & Chiu, 2017, pp. 6–7). Efficiency dividends were universally criticised in submissions by museum professionals in the 2016–2017 NSW parliamentary Inquiry into Museums and Galleries. In his submission, Griffin (2016b) points out that they have ‘decimated museum staffing and programs’ (p. 3), leading to reduction in outreach programmes, and the halving of staff including Indigenous, education, and exhibition staff (p. 21). Developments at the AM are typical of those taken by museums nationwide in response to economic pressures: a significant factor in McKay’s appointment was her experience in marketing and communications (Boland, 2014), there have been massive capital expenditures at the same time as extensive staff layoffs (Aubusson, 2015), greater corporate sponsorship has been sought (Taylor, 2015), and its                                                 9 A report from the American Association of Museums (2012), Museums and the American Economy in 2011, found that in response to the Global Financial Crisis in the USA, 28% of institutions froze hiring, 13% laid off staff, 33% deferred maintenance, 30% relied more on volunteers, 26% relied more on their own collections for exhibitions, 4% deaccessioned items from their collection, and 9% raised their admission prices. 10 Efficiency dividends are ‘initiatives in which assumed productivity gains in the production of goods and services in kind are centrally deducted from the ministries’ budgets’ (Hawkesworth & Klepsvik, 2013, p. 108).  57 activities are further aligned with the tourism imperatives of the state government (Power, 2016).   2015–16 2016–17 2017–18 2018–19 Total Australian National Maritime Museum -$333 -$769 -$770 -$772 -$2644 National Gallery of Australia -$496 -$1143 -$1148 -$1153 -$3940 National Museum of Australia -$622 -$1432 -$1440 -$1447 -$4941 National Portrait Gallery -$173 -$398 -$400 -$431 -$1402 Museum of Australian Democracy -$207 -$476 -$479 -$482 -$1644 Figure 6: Funding cuts to national cultural institutions 2015–2019 (in thousands) (Barneveld & Chiu, 2017, p. 5)  Critics of decreasing funding have questioned its effect on social inclusion in museums. The language of performance indicators, for example, is ‘more likely to focus on the quantitative—visitor numbers, spend per head and cost per visitor—rather than the composition of visitors and the museum’s benefit to the wider public’ (Sandell, 1998, p. 402). Similarly, Tlili (2008) argues that performance management and social inclusion should be treated as distinct ‘as they can potentially pull in different, competing directions…economic / instrumental on the one hand and the ethical on the other’ (p. 15). Museums out of necessity must fit their traditional missions within the economic imperatives of governments (Janes & Sandell, 2007, p. 3). In ‘Balancing mission and money: Critical issues in museum economics,’ Silberberg and Lord (2015) agree that ‘[m]useum economics is…very much about achieving a balance between mission-related and financial imperatives’ (p. 156). They also point out the lack of informed thinking in museum theory and practice on the issue. Gilmore and Rentschler (2002) also seek to balance the custodial and marketing functions of museums, the dilemma being how to ‘become better marketing managers without losing creativity and expertise in custodial management’ (p. 757). Social inclusion is just one factor that must be balanced with increasing financial constraints on museums.   58 The success of the balancing act is evaluated here according to the weight given to social and queer inclusion. It is suggested that managerial tools tied with a strong sense of purpose can be powerful agents in the process—the introduction of mission and philosophy statements under Griffin is just one example. Looking at the AM under McKay’s directorship shows that the language of inclusion remains. In the 2014–15 Annual Report for instance, she gives equal weight to the museum’s new corporate strategic plan and to social inclusion of Indigenous and Pacific Islander communities (Australian Museum, 2015a, p. 3), outwardly continuing the museum’s arguably leading role since the 1970s in building a new relationship to these communities based on self-determination rather than paternalism (Specht & MacLulich, 2000). Its activities are also understandable given the strength of its collections in the area, and the need to shift its relationship to communities that were subject to colonial domination (Rigg, 1994).  The queer-inclusive projects of the 1990s—discussed in the next section—have not been continued. The only relevant activities since then have been the ‘Jurassic Lounge’ events from 2011–2015, some of which coincided with the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (Mardi Gras). These ‘after hours’ events incorporated bars, live bands, performers, artists, and DJs to attract younger, not necessarily queer, audiences (Shrapnel, 2012). Indeed, none of the evaluation reports of the events mention or measure the sex, gender, or sexuality of the visitors (Australian Museum, 2015b). In addition, as events organised by an external partner, The Festivalists, they cannot be said to represent sustained engagement between the museum and queer communities. The lack of relevant programming is surprising in light of the AM’s early momentum in the 1990s, and as Oxford Street—an iconic centre for queer communities in Sydney—begins one block away from the museum. While the discourse of inclusion and diversity continues to have support at the AM, it does not match the leadership on social justice issues that the museum has displayed in the past.  The changes in funding and management at the AM are broadly representative of the changes across the museum sector nationally. Contrasting past and current directors, there is evidence that decreasing government funding has placed pressure on activities that contribute social rather than financial value. However, it is not inevitable with evidence being given that managerial techniques can be used to bring about socially valuable outcomes. Maximising such outcomes, especially given constraints, requires leadership.  59 4.2 Leadership  The working definition of leadership that will be refined in this section is ‘the process in which an individual influences other group members towards the attainment of group or organisational goals’ (Davies, 2007, p. 254). It is argued that individual leadership is required where existing structures and processes encouraging queer inclusion have not been established; and that, thereafter, a wider network of leadership can be enabled within the organisation. The AM under the leadership of Griffin will again be used as a case study of the successful negotiation of individual and organisational leadership.  Leadership, while often discussed in the literature on museum management, is a vague concept. The inconsistency between definitions reflects distinct approaches, sometimes importing models of leadership more appropriate to for-profit businesses and companies rather than cultural organisations. In particular, the ‘traits’ and ‘style’ approaches that focus on the supposed characteristics of leaders, still prominent in museum studies, has been regarded as too simplistic (Davies, 2007, p. 255). While there are diverse views, taken together, the literature nevertheless helps to suggest some of its potential qualities. From interviews with 45 directors and assistant directors, Suchy (1999) concludes that five themes unite leaders: ‘a passion for the primary product; a commitment to social principles…; building trusting relationships through education; entrepreneurism and innovation; and constructive discontent as a way of creating the future’ (p. 62). Sandell (2003) from interviews with 22 senior museum managers finds that leaders showed ‘willingness to take risks, support staff in their, sometimes experimental, approaches to working with audiences, and act as an effective advocate for the organization’s work’ (p. 54). In supporting the argument that leadership has the capacity to drive inclusion agendas where no enabling structures exist, Griffin and Abraham (2007) observe from an empirical study of 33 museums that ‘[cohesive] leadership was able to translate external needs to internal vision and then to employee action, integrate tasks, structures, processes and systems at the technical, political and cultural levels, and integrate management practices to build internal and external unity’ (p. 105).  The preceding accounts of museum leadership tend to emphasise the role of individuals. As Moore (1994) observes, ‘[l]eadership is fashionable…in museums at present, but more in a  60 “heroic” than a “post-heroic” mould. Museum directors are currently cult figures, portrayed as rescuing and revitalizing moribund museum services’ (p. 11). The importance of individuals beyond directors should not be discounted, however, as seen abundantly in instances of queer inclusion in Australia led by queer individuals and allies (section 4.4). Rather, leadership by individuals can be viewed in productive relation with leadership displayed by groups or organisations. Janes and Sandell (2007) emphasise the importance of ‘informal leaders’ as well as traditionally conceived leaders, consistent with Morris (2006) who maintains that ‘[l]eaders can exist at several levels in the organization. Not only is there a formal hierarchy, but also an informal network of leadership’ (p. 43). It can be taken to reside across all these individuals, and museum organisations as a whole when they sustain inclusive projects.  The AM under the directorship of Des Griffin successfully balanced the tension between individual and organisational leadership. It is both the case that Griffin was a strong advocate for Indigenous and queer inclusion of his own accord across many domains, and also that Griffin had key individuals and teams supporting him. The museum under his tenure readily participated in socially inclusive projects, underpinned by his personal commitment to cultural diversity and anti-discrimination: ‘I can’t stand discrimination in any form, in any situation, and I am immensely interested in cultural diversity.…The richness of any culture I just find absolutely fascinating and wonderful’ (Griffin, 2016a, interview). In his capacity as director of the Australian Museum for 22 years (1976–1998), chairman of the Council of Australian Museum Associations (1988–1993), and as the first president of Museums Australia (1993–1996), he oversaw the greater inclusion of Indigenous history and people at the AM and beyond. At a national level, he advocated for the adoption of Previous Possessions, New Obligations: Policies for Museums in Australia and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples which struck a new relationship with the First Australians based on ‘the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to self-determination in respect of cultural heritage matters’ (Griffin, 1996, p. 60). During the conference session where the policy was adopted, it was decided that similar policies were needed for other marginalised groups, leading to the Women’s Policy for Museum Programs and Practice and the Gay & Lesbian Policy Guidelines for Museum Programs and Practice (Museums Australia, 1999, 2000b).   61 Griffin’s tenure also saw the AM undertake several notable activities to include queer communities through a series of exhibitions. The largest was Prejudice and Pride (11 February–10 March 1994), covering the history of the Mardi Gras, an annual queer festival that culminates in an extravagant parade and party. Griffin anticipated the controversy that occurred when the politician Fred Nile (1994) asked in NSW Parliament ‘[i]s it a fact that the Australian Museum has an offensive, explicit homosexual and lesbian mardi gras parade exhibition[?]’ During the development of the Prejudice and Pride exhibition, Griffin was proactive in keeping the NSW Minister for the Arts informed of developments. In a letter justifying the exhibition to the Minister before it opened, Griffin cites articles from the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and then outlines ways in which the law, the Christian churches, and the medical profession had unjustly sought to control homosexuality (Griffin, 1994). The commitment to relevance and the utility of controversy was foreshadowed in his first public address as director of the AM: ‘[m]useums are part of the community. They must be involved in exposing community issues,…they must be controversial’ (Griffin, 1977) (see section 7.2: Utilising controversy). The integration of management to mission can be discerned here, one underlined by a commitment to social justice and human rights. In part, the political climate at the time allowed it to occur with the museum having the strong support from the Minister for the Arts who commended the exhibition, and trustees like the Liberal politician Chris Puplick—former chair of the Australian National Council on AIDS and former president of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board—who opened the display (Williams, 1994).   While Griffin was a major driver behind the diversity and inclusion initiatives, he also established processes that detached them from the motivations of any one individual, opening up the opportunities for leadership on socially relevant issues to more workers at the museum. The promotion of organisational change cannot happen without individual commitment but its impact will be limited if it does not involve others across the organisation. In a similar display of leadership, David Fleming (2012), director of the National Museums Liverpool, oversaw the opening of April Ashley: Portrait of a Lady (on one of the first people in the UK to have had sex reassignment surgery) and the establishment of the Social Justice Alliance for Museums. Fleming’s view is that ‘strong, determined leadership at the outset of major change in museums is likely to be needed…[which] can evolve into something more involving and consensual’ (p. 73). To  62 this end, Griffin established the Rapid Response Program (1992–1995) under which the Pride and Prejudice exhibition opened, which provided a structure to allow inclusive and responsive programming to occur. As a result, ‘heroic leadership’ and individual advocacy became less central, allowing practices to become embedded within institutional activities.   The programme allowed the production of exhibitions on topical issues with a lead time of four to eight weeks instead of up to three years for a major exhibition (Field & Howie, 1994, p. 23). Griffin (2016a, interview) explains that ‘traditionally, a museum would say “that’s interesting, we’ll have to consider that.” Rapid Response says “no, this is an issue of major concern.…We should have something to say about this to our public.”’ Other exhibitions opened under the programme included those on the High Court’s Mabo Decision, ozone depletion, and international trade agreements. It also allowed any individual or groups of staff to propose exhibition ideas, thereby encouraging a wider network of ‘informal leaders’ to engage with contemporary social issues (Australian Museum, 1992, p. 4). In addition to Prejudice and Pride, the museum opened Blak Beauty and Warrali Barrul at its satellite location djamu Gallery in 1999 to coincide with the Mardi Gras (Australian Museum, 1999). The gallery was another innovation that sought to work with Indigenous artists outside of the anthropological framework central to AM (Barrett & Millner, 2014, p. 59). Finally, the AM hosted the travelling exhibition Forbidden Love – Bold Passion: An Exhibition of Lesbian Stories 1900s–1990s in 1996. Between the queer exhibitions that the museum mounted during the 1990s, the advocacy on Indigenous rights led by Griffin, and expansion beyond its traditional anthropological and natural history concerns, the AM was in a leading role with respect to reflective practice, experimentation, and social justice.  Despite the inclusive activities of the AM in the 1990s, there are no ongoing efforts of queer inclusion. The impetus driving particular projects and strategies can pass with the departure of key individuals, and this appears to be the case at the AM in terms of LGBTIQ programmes. Even when figures like Griffin establish processes that allow responsive programming to be sustained, these too can be short-lived: the Rapid Response Program was started in 1992 and reference to it ends three years later. Commenting on changes at the museum after his departure, Griffin (2016b) remarks ‘[i]n almost all respects the [Australian] Museum has declined to the state it was in the early 1950s’ (p. 3). Here, the  63 comments are interpreted to mean a retreat from social history, social inclusion, and social justice that the museum pursued in the 1990s in favour of a return to its traditional focus on natural history and anthropology. It also seems to be a withdrawal from the characteristics of leadership offered in the literature on museum management that entail ‘willingness to take risks [and] support staff in their, sometimes experimental, approaches to working with audiences’ (Sandell, 2003, p. 54).   Griffin (2016b) adds that ‘[l]eadership of (non art) museums in Australia has passed to Melbourne and Brisbane in scholarship, exhibition development, education and collection access’ (p. 4). In terms of queer inclusion, it is particularly true of the Melbourne Museum that includes a video of a gay couple in the permanent exhibition The Melbourne Story (Figure 7) (Karskens, 2009) and that has supported the largest LGBTIQ collection survey undertaken in Australia (section 5.4). The Victorian state government has also increased its funding to the arts through Creative Victoria following reductions from the federal government (Mendelssohn, 2016, p. 19). In addition, it has contributed $15 million towards establishing the Victorian Pride Centre in Melbourne housing organisations including the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, an investment announced by the first Minister for Equality in Australia, Martin Foley (Hunn, 2017; Premier of Victoria, 2017). It has been claimed that such LGBTIQ centres ‘often fulfil the role of an ecomuseum in terms of community empowerment and identity forming’ (Giménez-Cassina, 2010, p. 36), lending further support to Griffin’s claim that cultural leadership has moved to other places and organisations.   64  Figure 7: Video interactive in the permanent exhibition The Melbourne Story at the Melbourne Museum featuring Mac Ronan and Geoff Allingham, a gay couple. 27/07/17  Although leadership is hard to define, it is clearly required for museums to undertake activities that increase queer inclusion. Leadership was displayed by the AM as an organisation, by Des Griffin, and by key supporters during the 1990s. As the highpoint of efforts of social and queer relevance, it also suggests the influence of other factors. The economic environment has become more stringent as the previous section established, and although structures enabling these activities were established, they were temporary. The next section considers how policies can help sustain inclusive practices.  4.3 Policy to practice  This section will look at the role of policy in encouraging queer-inclusive practices. While leadership is essential where no policies or processes exist, establishing formal mechanisms encourages inclusive practices to become widespread—ideally, politics informs policies that, in turn, influence practices (Dewdney, Dibosa, & Walsh, 2012, pp. 122–123). In Australia, the Gay & Lesbian Policy Guidelines for Museum Programs and Practice (GLP) technically remain in operation but its influence on practice is limited compared with the  65 USA and UK, demonstrating that policies alone are insufficient. The second part, focusing on the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (MAAS), supports the contention that individuals play a major role in implementing policies.  The history behind the GLP is a clear case where the politics of inclusion was pursued by effecting changes in policy and management. As gay artists continued to die from complications resulting from AIDS in the 1990s, many without wills, issues surrounding where their works ended up arose. This led Noel Frankham from the Australia Council for the Arts to write a paper urging artists to consider the future of their works (Institute of Modern Art, 1992, p. 2). According to Robert Swieca (2015, interview) who co-developed the policy, ‘at the same time, because of this, we were starting to think “what are the wider issues in public institutions that have objects from gay and lesbian people? Or don’t have objects and want to collect? How do we fit this into a wider framework?” Because there was no framework.’ The resulting GLP was adopted at the Museums Australia conference in Brisbane in December 1995 (Swieca et al., 1999, p. 4). The humanitarian crisis brought about by HIV/AIDS, and wide political support among governments and museums for effective responses, form the enabling background behind the GLP.  A substantial portion of the consequent policy covers areas relevant to management under the headings of ‘effective management’ and ‘staff employment, training and professional development.’ In addition to listing suggestions for senior management, directors, and boards, the policy begins with a striking preamble tying the absence of gay and lesbian culture from museums with the isolation of individuals:  The absence of lesbian and gay culture, history and concerns from the museum is a powerful way of ensuring that each woman and man will continue to make that painful journey to a sexual identity alone and often ashamed; will continue to be deprived of a rich and satisfying history; and will continue to feel the exclusion and marginalisation that characterises Australian society today (Museums Australia, 1999, p. 1).  Swieca (2015, interview) highlights the preamble as ‘a very important thing.…I think people read the preamble and understand “well yeah, this is why.”’ Like mission statements  66 of policies and cultural institutions, the preamble conveys the values and sense of purpose guiding resulting actions.  The GLP exists as one of many factors that influence the decisions at individual Australian museums looking to engage with LGBTIQ communities and subjects. However, the existence of policies can influence but is insufficient to guarantee practice, particularly as the policy gives recommendations rather than mandates for practice, and as there are no mechanisms other than scholarly and professional commentary to evaluate its influence. Reviewing the interviews conducted for the current research shows that the policy has not been the direct motivation for any queer-inclusive activities. Given that the policy was adopted in 1999, that most of the queer engagements in museum theory and practice have occurred in the last ten years, as well as the restrictive ‘gay and lesbian’ framework of the document, the GLP is in much need of review. Despite its negligible influence, most interviewees have been aware of the existence of the policy and acknowledge its symbolic value. It has also been cited with approval by academics in Australia and overseas (Gorman-Murray, 2004, p. 21; Liddiard, 2004, p. 26).  Comparing different policy and governance contexts shows their relative strengths and weaknesses. In the UK as in Australia, the majority of museum funding comes from public sources: 66% of funding for Australian museums comes from governments (Mansfield, Winter, Griffith, Dockerty, & Brown, 2014, p. 4), with museums in the UK likely to receive 50–70% of their operating revenue through public sources (Silberberg & Lord, 2015, p. 164). Unlike Australia, however, there is a greater degree of centralised funding for museums—e.g. through the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, and the Arts Council England—as well as organisation through the peak professional body, Museums Association (MA). Although none of the bodies have LGBTIQ policies relating to museums, MA (2013, 2016) has released strong advocacy statements including Valuing Diversity: The Case for Inclusive Museums and Museums Change Lives that clearly insert a broad conception of diversity and inclusion within a social justice framework. These bodies and policies allow for a greater level of coordination than in Australia where a pastiche of local, state, and federal environments overlap. The situation in the UK potentially enables policies to have more impact as compliance is more closely tied to streams of funding. Arts Council England, the development body for English regional museums, for instance,  67 revoked the accreditation of the Northampton Museum when it sold a collection item to fund capital works. It has had deleterious effects on the museum’s bid for public funds (Pickford, 2014). Given that queer inclusion is not a high priority among public sources of funds in Australia, and the GLP only presents guidelines, accountability to written principles remains a weakness.  In the USA, the majority of funding for museums comes from non-government sources: 24.1% from government sources, 35.2% from private sources, 31% from earned income, and 9.6% from investments (Merritt, 2006, p. 61). Similar to Australia, there is no central body overseeing the development of museums and galleries apart from the administration of the nineteen Smithsonian Institutions. Its member-based peak professional body American Alliance of Museums (AAM), like the Museums Association in the UK, does have a museum accreditation scheme but joining is voluntary and has even fewer funding implications than in the UK. It is not surprising then that only ten per cent of museums in the USA have been accredited (Cochran, 2011). However, the AAM currently has the strongest LGBTIQ policy framework among the three countries. The Welcoming Guidelines for Museums (LGBTQ Alliance, 2016) adapted the AAM’s ‘Standards of Excellence’ to produce a checklist of guidelines on outreach and ‘in-reach’ ‘to help increase the likelihood that all LGBTQ communities – staff, visitors, management, and allies from any field – have welcoming experiences in museums’ (Leitch et al., 2016, p. 145). The comprehensive document groups its points under categories impacting the entire institution.11 Another of the AAM’s (2014) policies, the ‘Diversity and Inclusion Policy,’ recognises both sexuality and gender identity as elements of diversity; similar cross-referencing between general and LGBTIQ diversity is undertaken by Museums Australia (1999, 2000a). Integration of LGBTIQ and cultural diversity is one of the strengths of the GLP but its implementation could be improved through a long overdue examination of its effectiveness, and further coordination of the museum sector through both member-based and perhaps intergovernmental bodies.                                                   11 These categories are public trust and accountability, mission and planning, leadership and organisational structure, collections stewardship, education and interpretation, financial stability, and facilities and risk management.  68 The second part of the section turns to the role that individuals continue to play even in amenable policy, and operating environments. As discussed in section 4.2 ‘Leadership,’ there is an interrelationship between individual and organisational change. Even after formal mechanisms encouraging inclusion and diversity are introduced, their implementation is still dependent on members of staff, a dependence that increases in proportion to the absence of official instruments. As will now be discussed, individuals at MAAS have pursued queer inclusion in exhibitions and collection despite limited institutional structures and resources.   MAAS, Sydney, receives 75.6% of its funding through the State Government of New South Wales (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2015a, p. 42). As well as having mandated requirements, for example workplace diversity requirements under the Government Sector Employment Act 2013 (NSW), the Board of Trustees oversees the governance of the museum’s 24 internal policies.12 The policies do not mention sex, gender, or sexual diversity other than in the Controversy Management Policy that states that ‘[s]ex and sexuality…are legitimate topics for exhibitions’ (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2006, p. 3), which also includes a case study of the controversy that surrounded the gay artist Robert Mapplethorpe’s work in the USA (section 7.2). In the context of collection development, past curators have had to justify acquisitions of queer objects in terms of the general categories of the collection development policy, successfully justifying the acquisition of significant costumes and posters from the Mardi Gras, expansion of the medical collection relating to HIV/AIDS, and housing of the Australian AIDS Memorial Quilt (section 7.3). However, the superseding of the successful and detailed 2001 Collection Development & Research Policy in 2015 represents, according to curator Peter Cox, a turn away from social history (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2001, 2015b):                                                 12 The internal policies of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences include the Code of Conduct, Collection Management Policy, Conflict of Interest, Conservation Policy, Controversy Management Policy, Corruption Prevention Policy, Deaccessioning Policy, Disposal Policy, Guarantee of Service, Incoming Loans Policy, Internet / Intranet Usage and Social Media Policy, Members Policy, OHS Committee Constitution, Online Privacy Statement, Ongoing Loans Policy, Outreach and Professional Services Fees Policy, Outreach Policy, Privacy Management Policy, Recycling Plan, Research and Publishing Policy, Sponsorship Policy, Storage Policy, and Volunteers Policy (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2015a, pp. 92–93)  69  The policy that was in place from 2001 was one that catered for inclusiveness and looked at community in a fairly broad sense and gave the Museum a responsibility in its collecting to document the various communities that exist within the broader society. Any collecting that a curator wanted to do that related to gay life was easily justified in terms of that policy. I don’t recall any acquisitions that were not endorsed. That policy was a broad enough instrument to justify, certainly documenting, gay and lesbian community.…[In the 2015 policy] there’s a decreased emphasis on documenting everyday life and more of an emphasis on design, decorative arts, applied art, and technology. I think that that’s a shame.…I don’t think it’s going to stop us collecting material that’s relevant to gay and lesbian history but it means that we’ll have to justify it in a slightly different way (Cox, 2015, interview).  Comparing the 2001 and 2015 policies corroborates his position. The preface of the 2001 policy used new museological language explicitly to affirm its obligations: ‘museums are expected to play a broader role in society…must demonstrate their relevance to local communities…[and] respond to new sensitivities and cultural diversity’ (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2001). One of its three broad collecting areas was ‘Australian history and society’ including Indigenous, migration, and NSW social history (pp. 25–30). Indicative of later shifts, the Migration Heritage Centre—a virtual museum that MAAS hosted—closed in 2013; static funding in the 2000s and decreasing capacity in real terms also led management to dismiss a fifth of museum staff in 2014 (Gilmore, 2014); and the 2017–2022 Strategic Plan emphasises its disciplinary areas and engagements with science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2017, p. 11). This context explains the revision of the 2015 collection development policy that withdraws from the language used in 2001, instead focusing on specialist areas of the MAAS collection with a vague description of ‘contemporary culture’ given alongside seven other collection areas (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2015b, pp. 7–9). The effects have been the movement away from social history, and giving more discretion to curators, acquisition committees, and the executive on collection development.   70 Cox’s disclosure that ‘we’ll have to justify it in a slightly different way’ suggests that he will use his discretionary power for community-oriented ends. In terms of politics / policy / practice, despite the lack of policies that assist social and queer inclusion, a culture of inclusiveness continues to be embedded in individuals. McCall and Gray (2014) argue that policy and role ambiguity makes museum workers ‘key agents in utilising the rhetoric related to the “new museology” in the pursuit of multiple museum functions and in managing their own practices’ (pp. 31–32). Nevertheless, individual senses of responsibility are not ideal for ensuring uniformity of practice across individual museums, let alone the museum sector. The lack of formal instruments points to a need to strengthen policies that foreground inclusion within museum professional associations, individual museums, and government bodies. It also invokes the perennial issues within the sector of national standards, perhaps tied to accreditation and funding schemes, as well as the standardisation of museum studies programmes (Arts Tasmania et al., 2014; Barrett, 2011b). Such moves, however, would be against the conditions that led to fragmented practice across the country, namely the relationship between federal and state governments. Indeed, past national coordinating bodies and infrastructure like Australian Museums Online, the Collections Australia Network, and the Collections Council of Australia have been defunded (Mansfield et al., 2014, p. 30), the termination of the latter ‘put[ing] back 20 years the development of a national policy for the distributed national collection’ (Griffin & Paroissien, 2011, p. 5). In this environment, individual and organisational initiative will be progressively more central to translating the politics of inclusion into institutional practices.  Reviewing engagements with LGBTIQ communities in the UK, Sandell and Frost (2010) write that ‘museum practice nevertheless remains highly uneven with pockets of innovation and experimentation amongst widespread wariness, uncertainty, ambivalence or disinterest’ (p. 151). It is also the situation in Australia where the politics of queer inclusion, policies that ensure its consideration, and practices at individual museums do not connect uniformly. The GLP was an attempt to coordinate a national response but, apart from its symbolic value, it appears to have had little impact. Nevertheless, ‘pockets of innovation’ are recorded throughout the thesis, with leadership from individuals and teams at institutions like the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences driving inclusion agendas. Supporting such individuals by providing employment and networking opportunities is critical.  71 4.4 Employment and networking  Given the lack of policies that enable queer inclusion in Australian museums, the commitment of groups within the museum workforce becomes central to driving inclusion initiatives. Policymakers and management can encourage inclusive practices by reflecting on the barriers that reproduce the status quo among museum workers, and establishing forums for queer workers and allies to network. As will be shown, Australia lacks measures on both fronts.  LGBTIQ individuals experience multiple forms of discrimination including violence, harassment, and bullying because of their identities; insufficient legal recognition and social / medical support for non-binary gender identities; and lack of recognition for non-normative relationships (e.g. polyamorous). In the workplace, a 2002 report drawing on the experiences of 900 lesbian, gay, and transgender Australians found that 59% of participants encountered prejudice and harassment in their workplace due to their gender identity or sexuality (Irwin, 2002). In another study, 10.3% of participants reported being refused employment or promotion because of their sexuality (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2011). As a result, a third of LGBTIQ employees choose to remain closeted (Pride in Diversity, 2015b).  There is little evidence to expect these statistics to be different in museums. Museums in Australia have not been prominent advocates for workplace diversity; nor do they fare well  72 in terms of ethnic, gender, or class diversity.13 None, for instance, has signed on to Pride in Diversity, the ‘only national not-for-profit employer support program for all aspects of LGBTI workplace inclusion’ (Pride in Diversity, 2015a) and the only registered LGBTI safe spaces among cultural institutions in New South Wales are the Newcastle Museum, the Casula Powerhouse Art Centre, and the Pine Street Art Centre (ACON, 2016). In remarks about ethnic minorities, which can be extended to queer visibility, Sandell (2007b) writes that museums develop ‘cultures that reflect the norms, attitudes and values of the dominant majority.…Within these organisations can exist a tendency to recruit an implicit model, one that reflects the existing demographics of the profession’ (pp. 207–208). There are few statistics for the diversity of the 7,856 museum workers in Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008b, p. 3) with the last survey of Museum Australia member demographics only revealing that ‘a majority of members are baby boomers’ (Museums Australia, 2013, p. 17). Given the lack of data on museum workplace issues, it can only be surmised that there is a general lack of visibility of queer issues within the museum sector, regardless of how many queer individuals and allies exist. Australia lags behind in terms of research on the diversity and working conditions of its museum workforce—not only sexual and gender identity, but indigeneity, ethnicity, gender, and class—pointing to numerous, pressing areas for investigation.  To increase queer visibility within museums in addition to measures ensuring equal access to employment, special interest groups and networks have formed within museum associations and at individual museums. In the UK, staff at the Victoria and Albert                                                 13 The most systematic studies of museum workforce diversity and discrimination have occurred overseas, though none of the following has considered sexuality or gender identity. They are nonetheless indicative of the widespread lack of diversity among museum staff in many forms and at all levels. Museums Association, UK, in its report Diversify: Reflections and Recommendations focused on the underrepresentation of ‘Black, Asian, and Minority-Ethnic’ (BAME) groups among museum staff. It found that BAME people comprised 7% of the museum workforce, compared with 12% among the population (Shaw, 2013, p. 12). The Association of Art Museum Directors (2014), USA, found that women held less than 50% of directorships and earned 79¢ for every dollar earned by a male counterpart (p. 4). Among art museum staff in the USA more broadly, a report from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation found that 72% of staff were non-Hispanic white (compared with 62% of the USA population) (Schonfeld, Westermann, & Sweeney, 2015, p. 7).  73 Museum (V&A) started the LGBTQ Network in 2006 to build queer connections within the collection, organise queer events especially around LGBT History Month, and to conduct tours incorporating relevant objects in the collection (Winchester, 2012). In the USA, the LGBTQ Alliance was formed within the AAM to provide a similar forum. As discussed in the previous section, the LGBTQ Alliance (2016) published the Welcoming Guidelines for Museums that converts the peak body’s standards of excellence to a checklist of items that museums can use to facilitate queer inclusion. Australia was an early leader in the area, forming the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Museums Australia (GLAMA) in 1994 to fulfil the aims of the GLP, as well as to allow interested members to network (Swieca et al., 1999, p. 4). However, like the limited impact of the policy itself, by 2007 the last coordinator Jenny Scott (2015b, interview) gauged little interest for GLAMA and it is now inactive. Indeed, one of the responses was that ‘members feel absolutely no need for such a Section [sic]’ (Scott, 2013, personal communication). I also discerned a lack of interest for the group following my address to Museum Australia members in 2014 (Nguyen, 2014). The non-existence of such a group runs counter to trends internationally, and is a further barrier against forming an inclusive community of practice.  A ‘community of practice’ is ‘a learning community sharing common goals and developing sets of practices within a social relationship built over time, a community that continues to grow and shape its future’ (Kelly & Gordon, 2002, p. 53). Importantly, it re-centres ‘community’ within museum discourse as not only existing outside of institutions but also within, and furthermore recognises the ongoing creation of new, perhaps more inclusive, norms within the museum community. Accordingly, the evaluation of the Diversify programme of Museums Association, UK, asserts that ‘[i]t is rightly accepted and expected that museums should be relevant to the communities they serve. This should also be true of the people who work in museums’ (Shaw, 2013, p. 23). The idea of forming a community of practice has been applied to museum engagements with Indigenous communities and, in some ways, there are parallels with the situation of queer communities. Both are enmeshed within structures that discriminate against them and exclude them from decisions that affect them, racism and institutional heteronormativity respectively (see Figure 2, pp. 3–5). In regard to Indigenous Australians, two measures that have been widely adopted by museums include equal opportunity employment practices and self-determination in respect of their heritage (Griffin, 1996). They support one another in that the presence of Indigenous staff  74 within museums is a direct way of enabling self-determination. While care must be taken in not equating different forms of structural discrimination, such measures may be applicable for engagements between museums and queer communities.14  Writing about measures to increase the diversity of museum workforces, Sandell (2007b) distinguishes between the ‘affirmative action’ and ‘diversity management’ approaches. The former requires individuals to adapt to the organisational culture of the museum, while the diversity management approach requires that the museum negotiate changes to accommodate individuals (p. 214). However, he posits that ‘the museum sector needs positive action to reach a position from which it can effectively manage diversity’ (p. 215; emphasis in original), reaffirming the importance of equal opportunity employment measures adopted towards Indigenous Australians and the reform of colonialist, paternalist practices. In a similar vein, it is argued here that the widespread reforms entailed in queering museums require queer-identified individuals to be empowered to make decisions about their heritage. Such measures could be embedded within the policies and management practices at the individual museums and in the sector broadly.  At the same time, there is conceptual and strategic value in involving allies in queer-inclusive activities, as recognised by GLAMA, the V&A LGBTQ Network, and the AAM’s LGBTQ Alliance that are all open to non-queer individuals. 15  Conceptually, such involvement emphasises that queer diversity is part of wider social diversity and is the responsibility of all staff (Müller, 2001). Strategically, it increases the number of motivated individuals who can assist in projects. Many of the individuals involved in the collection and exhibition activities discussed in the thesis have not identified as LGBTIQ and much institutional knowledge and influence resides in them. Mathew Trinca, former curator at the                                                 14  There is an unfortunate history of political movements co-opting the agendas of other marginalised groups. Maddee Clark (2015), a genderqueer / genderfluid Bundjalung writer, writes that ‘[i]t is important to investigate where and when we can draw parallels, solidarity and common interest in the ways we experience marginalisation, as well as recognising when that “comparison” subsumes, homogenises, appropriates, erases, or colonises’ (p. 252). 15 An ‘ally’ has been defined as ‘a person who is a member of the dominant [non-queer] group who works to end oppression in his or her [sic] own personal and professional life by supporting and advocating with the oppressed population’ (University of Illinois Springfield, 2017).  75 Western Australian Museum, Perth, was able to facilitate the museum’s collaboration with a queer artist amid suspicion, to a certain extent, due to an existing partnership with the Curtin University of Technology, Perth. The artist reflects, ‘Mat Trinca was my “inside” man.…He was not gay but was open to facilitating new and possibly confronting ideas with the Museum’ (Darbyshire & Karkruff, 2014). Allies like Trinca and Griffin, and the linkages they encourage, were crucial to enabling queer-inclusive programming. Nikki Sullivan, a queer-identified curator at the Migration Museum, Adelaide, combines both support for LGBTIQ diversity in staffing alongside networking forums. She adds that external review is required to sustain these beyond individual initiative:  One of the dangers for me is that often these things get done in organisations because there’s a particular staff member driving them. Then that staff member leaves and it all falls in a heap.…One of the things that I am hoping to do is to join an organisation called Pride in Diversity which publishes the Australian Workplace Equality Index. You submit a whole lot of documentation about your practice and it gets evaluated in terms of how LGBTIQ-friendly you are.…Once we get the momentum up and you get people interested, we can set up an ally or LGBTIQ network across History SA (Sullivan, 2016, interview).  The invisibility of queerness within Australian museums has been reinforced by the invisibility of LGBTIQ workers within the sector. The issue becomes more significant considering the lack of formal structures that lead to individuals becoming key drivers of queer inclusion. While there were promising developments at the professional association level like GLAMA and the GLP, the momentum they created was short-lived. It may be that lack of commitment by governments and museums, as well as increasing financial pressures, have led to equitable employment, and diversity and inclusion generally, being overshadowed. However, new evaluative models have sought to intervene to prioritise the public value of museums  4.5 Measuring value  Museums have had to be more explicit in communicating their contribution to society, not only due to economic imperatives but also because of managerial notions of accountability  76 that were outlined at the beginning of the chapter. While different strategies such as the ‘public value’ framework have sought to consider both intrinsic and instrumental contributions, none have gained traction. This section suggests that social and queer inclusion should be an integral part of these arguments, the proposed value frameworks, and measured statistics.   Arguably, for much of the twentieth century, museums considered their contribution to society through collecting, exhibiting, researching, and educating to be self-evident. In response to new museological critiques, museums had to demonstrate their value. In reorienting themselves towards communities, museum administrator and scholar Stephen Weil (1999) imagined an ‘entrepreneurial institution…providing a variety of educational services to the public, [which] will measure its success…[by] whether it actually is able to provide those services in a demonstrably effective way’ (pp. 229–230; emphasis added). From another angle, museums are expected by governments to demonstrate not simply these values but also ‘value for money.’ Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development became increasingly concerned with financial sustainability. Under the ‘new public management,’ public services including museums had their budgets, management, and performance closely monitored by governments (Scott, 2015a, p. 98). The use of mainly quantitative measurements to do so meant that museums had to adapt in order to remain competitive with other public services. Consequently, on-site and online attendance figures along with other metrics became central to justifying continued funding for museums, even though these measurements do not necessarily capture ‘ongoing visitation, membership, learning and support from…communities’ (Fraser & Heimlich, 2008a, p. 7). While continuing to be guided by their traditional sense of purpose, museums would have to generate more of their own revenue and become less reliant on government funding.  The debate over the value that museums contribute to society has moved on from if you can measure it in a way acceptable to governments to how to do so. As well as having to comply with conditions imposed on public services like meeting Key Performance Indicator targets, museums have directed attention to the concept of ‘public value’ to communicate their social benefit. While the public value framework considers non-utilitarian values and is more able to accommodate concerns for social inclusion, its minor  77 impact has been unsuccessful in countering the dominant, utilitarian government view of museums. Developed by Mark Moore (1995) in Creating Public Value: Strategic Management in Government and later applied to the cultural sector in John Holden (2006), public value has been adapted to the museum context by Carol Scott (2007; 2014; 2009, 2010, 2015a).16 17 It involves a method of collaborating with governments to maximise the ‘social return on investment’ from museums (Scott, 2010, p. 274). Instead of requirements being handed down from above, it entails a more consensual approach to strategic decision-making. Importantly, it recognises the primacy of the public but addresses the legitimate concern of governments with value. The framework is more able to communicate the multiple values that museums can offer to both individuals and communities, which Scott places in the following typology:  Individuals 1) Learning a) Self-directed learning in a free choice setting b) Skill building  1) Cognitive a) Discovery b) Enrichment c) Excitement d) Inspiration 2) Wellbeing a) Joy b) Pleasure 3) Empathetic a) Perspective b) Awareness 1) Citizenship a) Access to collections  1) Direct 2) Indirect 3) Non-use a) Bequest b) Option c) Exist-ence  Communities 1) Community cap-acity a) Community 1) Historical a) Community archive 1) Democracy a) Forum to debate                                                   16 Carol Scott is a museum consultant specialising in communicating and enhancing the public value of museums. She was President of Museums Australia 2000–2005 and Manager of Evaluation and Audience Research at the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, Sydney, 1991–2007. 17 A similar model is offered by cultural economist David Throsby (2001) who argues that ‘cultural value’ is irreducible to economics. Instead he separates out this value into aesthetic, spiritual, social, historical, symbolic, and authentic dimensions, which can be measured through means including expert appraisal (pp. 28–30).  78 learning resource b) Knowledge building c) Leisure facilities d) Civic pride 2) Social cohesion a) Engagement b) Inclusion c) Diversity 3) Economy a) Tourism b) Civic branding c) Inspiration d) Employment e) Local multipl-ier effect f) Urban regene-ration b) Cultural trans-mission c) Experience of the past d) The lessons of history e) Belonging 2) Social a) Sense of place b) Identity 3) Spiritual a) Meaning 4) Symbolic a) Commemora-tion     ideas/issues 2) Quality of information a) Unbiased b) Objective c) Trustworthy 3) Trust a) Customer service b) Excellence c) Continuity 4) Relationships a) Local b) National c) Interna-tional 5) Citizenship a) Access to collections Figure 8: Typology of museum value (Scott, 2009, p. 201)   Scott’s typology seeks to broaden ideas of impact and measure their degree. First, it includes both instrumental and intrinsic contributions of museums on an equal footing. While either has been granted greater weight by different stakeholders—instrumental value by politicians and intrinsic value by museum advocates—the typology acknowledges each. Thus, abstract goods including ‘belonging’ and ‘excitement’ (intrinsic) exist alongside ‘skill building’ and ‘civic branding’ (instrumental). In addition, their effects are considered at individual and community levels, so while ‘pleasure’ is experienced at an individual level, ‘social cohesion’ affects the broader community. Next, ‘institutional’ values, relating to the museum processes that create public value, measure qualities like ‘customer service’ and ‘access to collections.’ Finally, the typology includes different ‘use’ values, taking into  79 account direct use such as visitation, through to non-use like bequests.18 Taken together, the attraction that the typology holds for museum management and policymakers is the accommodation of traditional imperatives of museums and concerns with community engagement within the utilitarian directives of funding bodies. Thus, in an evaluation of the value of the Queensland Museum, researchers measured a range of market and non-market factors, concluding that the Queenslanders were willing to provide 2.3 to 2.9 times more funding to the museum. 19  While the funding boost is unlikely, it resulted from methodologies from the field of economics and led to a conclusion expressed in monetary terms (Tranter, 2009, pp. 3–4). Rigorous approaches that combine the non-economic values emphasised by museums, and the economic value stressed by funding bodies, hold the promise of being accepted by major stakeholders.  The ‘public value’ framework has been given a degree of acknowledgement by both federal and state governments to measure the effectiveness of their cultural policies; together, they account for the majority of public cultural funding in Australia with 33% coming from the federal government, 47% from state / territory governments, and the remaining 20% from local governments (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2014b). The latest NSW arts and cultural policy Create in NSW commits to working with bodies including the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Cultural Ministers Statistics Working Group (CMSWG) to gather national statistics; it further seeks to apply the Western Australian Government’s ‘Public Value Measurement Framework’ for evaluation (NSW Government, 2015, pp. 80–                                                18 Non-users of museums can still value museums. Five types of non-use values are ‘option value’ where people like the possibility of being able to visit, ‘existence value’ where enjoyment is received from the existence of an institution, ‘bequest value’ where satisfaction is gained from knowing their descendants will be able to visit, ‘prestige value’ where utility is gained by a person knowing that the institution is valued by others, and ‘education value’ where the institution’s contribution to culture is recognised (Frey & Meier, 2006, pp. 1022–1023). 19 The evaluation measured non-market values by asking participants to place the following statements on the Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree): ‘The Queensland Museum does important things for the people of Queensland; The Queensland Museum is not relevant to me and probably never will be; In the future, I might want to visit one of the museums or use one of the services of Queensland Museum; In years to come, people will think that the Queensland Museum achieved very little; I get personal benefit from things the Queensland Museum does; The Queensland Museum will leave an important legacy to future generations’ (Tranter, 2009, p. 77).  80 81). At the federal level, the last national cultural policy Creative Australia—which was active for less than a year (March–September 2013) given the change of government—used the emerging literature on measuring public value as a reference point for implementing the policy. It also indicated that tracking and targeting the policy would be underpinned by national data from the CMSWG (Australian Government, 2013, pp. 119–121). All the policies stressed the importance of gathering quantitative data to provide the evidence base for the ‘public value’ of the arts. However, given the limited scope of the statistics that would be captured, their ability to measure the extent of social and queer inclusion is open to question.  The ABS (2008a) in partnership with the Cultural Ministers’ Council—an intergovernmental organisation of federal, state, and territory arts and cultural ministers—published Arts and Cultural Heritage: An Information Development Plan (IDP). The document outlined the strategy to gather standardised data relevant to arts and cultural heritage across Australia. Notably, the document recognised that ‘[m]any Australian public arts and cultural heritage programs provide multiple aims, which encompasses both instrumental and intrinsic values, and in this IDP, both aspects are considered relevant’ (p. 9). Perhaps because of the difficulty of measuring intrinsic values, when outlining the statistics that would be captured in the document Towards Comparable Statistics for Cultural Heritage Organisations, reference to intrinsic values was removed entirely (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008c). Instead, measurements included attendance figures, visitor characteristics (analysed by age, sex, educational attainment, employment, and visitor satisfaction), finances, number of employees and volunteers, and size of the collection. While the use of such statistics could lead to a minimal analysis of social inclusion, for example by extrapolating from age distribution to how engaged young people are with museums, the potential to extrapolate to other forms of diversity is limited.20                                                  20 As an example of additional metrics that could measure the success of social inclusion, Ames (1994) has suggested measuring ratios including low income accessibility (hours per week available for free : total hours per week accessible during a minimum 3-month period), minority attendance (annual minority attendance : total attendance), balance of mission / market financing (sales income : total income applied to operations), and commitment to education (education staff payroll : total staff payroll) (pp. 24–29).  81 In particular, non-normative sex, gender, and sexual diversity is erased. ‘Sex’ for instance works exclusively within the male / female binary with no recognition that these may be different to a person’s gender identity (Mertens et al., 2008, p. 85). In the few evaluations that have been performed on queer programming in Australia, similar assumptions and erasures continue to operate. In evaluating the Jurassic Lounge events at the Australian Museum (2015b) that coincided with Mardi Gras, no information regarding sex, gender, or sexuality was gathered. Details of the museum’s visitor profile also do not measure these details, considering demographics including age, educational attainment, place of residence, primary language, and income (Australian Museum, 2011). Measurement of LGBTIQ audience development is not possible given the data collected in evaluation reports for the Australian Museum or the ABS. It may be felt that asking such information is inappropriate but, as the author of The Art of Relevance remarks, measuring relevance ‘may require collecting demographic or psychographic data about attendees beyond the fact of their presence. Collecting this data may be awkward. Get over it’ (Simon, 2016, p. 167). If public value is also intended to apply to queer communities, the statistical evidence cannot currently measure its impact.  The failure of models like the public value framework to gain traction may be due to the financial priorities of governments. More fundamentally, according to cultural economist David Throsby (2001), ‘it may have to be accepted that measurement may not be possible…according to any familiar quantitative or qualitative standard’ (p. 28). As a result, as the main author of the IDP Lisa Conolly (2013) explains, ‘[t]he economic contribution of museums is a fundamental expectation that is likely to remain important’ (pp. 124–125), an approach which would be favourable to museums given that studies show the positive contributions of museums to tourism and the economy (Australia Council for the Arts, 2017; Potts, 2014). While they should be promoted, the non-utilitarian contributions of museums including fostering social inclusion should also form part of these arguments. In Australia, Victoria has effectively expounded both the economic and social contributions of its investment in the arts and cultural sector: ‘the [creative industries] contribute $22.7 billion to Victoria (or 8% of the total economy) and they contribute immeasurably more in terms of social and cultural value’ (Creative Victoria, 2016a; emphasis added). Its cultural policy Creative Victoria (2016–2020) continues research ‘to develop a basis for future measurement’ while investing a further $115 million over four years (Creative Victoria,  82 2016c, p. 33). It distinguishes itself from the strategies of other governments through its arm’s-length, peer reviewed model, and also its integrated measurement of economic, social, and cultural impacts (Cooke, 2016; Creative Victoria, 2016b, p. 9).21 In addition to the investment in LGBTIQ services and facilities discussed in section 4.2, further support is added to Griffin’s claim that Victoria is one of the cultural leaders among governments in Australia. It illustrates that cultural investment underpinned by a strong sense of social and queer inclusion can occur even as uncertainties regarding evaluation remain outstanding.  Museums have moved on from the question of if their contribution to society can be measured to how it can be measured in a way that is compelling to funding bodies. The strength of the public value framework discussed is its ability to incorporate both instrumental and intrinsic contributions. As with any model, however, the possibility of heterosexist assumptions and queer erasure must be monitored. The financial pressures on museums should not stall this discussion. Admittedly, it is a difficult stance given the continuing application of efficiency dividends, the lack of a national cultural policy since Creative Australia was abandoned, and the discontinuation of ABS funds to collect Culture, Sport and Recreation statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2014a; Darcy & Dalton, 2014). However, as seen in the leadership of the State of Victoria in particular, valuing queer inclusion as part of an evidenced strategy of cultural investment is possible.  4.6 Conclusion  [Management] is not a threat but a defence, not a dull, dry science but a people-centred art, and not an interference but a catalyst for change. Above all, management is crucial to ensure that museums will survive and prosper in a rapidly changing world (Malaro, 1994, p. 13).  Effective museum management, perhaps more than ever, is a vital skill to ensure that museums survive and prosper. As Malaro observes correctly, it ‘is not a threat…but a                                                 21 Creative State breaks down impact into three aspects: economic impact (business growth, employment, exports, tourism, and investment); cultural impact (inspiration, diversity, excellence, and community pride and identity); social impact (improved education, better health and wellbeing, community strength, and crime prevention) (Creative Victoria, 2016b, p. 9).  83 catalyst for change.’ This chapter appraised the success of management according to the facilitation of queer inclusion, something that has not been achieved in a sustained manner in any Australian museum. Indeed, some of the trends identified indicate that such work may be more difficult today. Beyond LGBTIQ inclusion, Australia lacks (and indeed has lost) museum coordinating bodies; arts and culture planning among governments often lack direction; and resources continue to diminish. Though these factors compound the difficulty of pursuing social and queer inclusion, the examples of best practices discussed offer suggestions for coordinating future initiatives. Above all, leadership by queer and non-queer individuals like Des Griffin, organisations like the Australian Museum during his tenure, and governments such as the State of Victoria continue to be critical in enabling queer inclusion. At its best, leadership establishes a network of change-makers and encourages the formation of processes and structures that allow for broad-based transformation; when present, it can widen the influence of aligned politics, policies, and practices. When the result is further inclusion of queer communities, management is queered, laying the groundwork for change in other parts of the organisation. The remaining chapters look at three aspects of museum organisations in turn including their collections, exhibitions, and connections with communities.  84 5 Queering collections  Queer people are in museums. They work in them, they visit them, and their stories and objects are collected by them. But yet they are all too often invisible or barely visible (Raker, 2013, p. 1).  Objects and collections are central to both popular and specialist understandings of museums. According to Museums Australia (2002), ‘[a] museum helps people understand the world by using objects and ideas to interpret the past and present and explore the future. A museum preserves and researches collections’ (emphasis added). The importance of collections to museums is a remarkably persistent idea, even as theories and practices surrounding them have continually changed. Yet, as Raker identifies, queer communities are ‘invisible or barely’ visible in collections, requiring working with and against existing conventions. Through the simultaneous strategies of ‘queering’ existing material, collecting new material, and introducing new approaches to objects and collections, collections can be expanded in queer directions.  This chapter begins by tracing the historical conditions that have led to queer invisibility in collections (section 5.1). As a prelude to addressing the question ‘what is a queer object?’, the second section will discuss the dramatic shift in the way that objects are understood, broadly speaking from unproblematic evidence of rigid categories to material for open-ended meaning-making. The shift provides the justification for alternative ways to make objects meaningful, one of these being queer readings (section 5.3), which can also be applied in queer collection surveys (section 5.4). As well as re-interpreting existing collections, queer communities prioritise the collection of new material, particularly through oral histories (section 5.5). The final section explores ways that new museum forms—including pop-up museums and online museums—are challenging the notion that collections need to be object-based and permanent. While the projects examined critique museum collections, they do so by engaging with their accreted practices, invigorating them with new forms of social and queer relevance.   85 5.1 Where are the queer collections?  Objects relevant to LGBTIQ communities are scattered in collections across the estimated 52.5 million objects held by Australian museums and galleries that have not, as discussed in the previous chapter, been developed in a coordinated fashion given the largely state-based governance of most major museums (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008b, p. 3). To present a selection of objects, at the federal level there are LGBTIQ badges at the Museum of Australian Democracy and Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras costumes at the National Museum of Australia. State and federal museums have collected works, and mounted retrospective or survey exhibitions, of queer artists including Brook Andrew, Juan Davila, Deborah Kelly, David McDiarmid, and William Yang. And at the community level, the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives (ALGA) is notable in the breadth of its LGBTIQ historical collections. In both public and community settings, efforts to collect relevant material have been uneven and disconnected.  Searching for LGBTIQ objects across the estimated 3,000 museums in Australia is difficult given that no substantial cross-collection database exists (Winkworth, 2011). Indeed, as discussed in section 4.3 ‘Policy to practice,’ initiatives such as the Collections Australia Network that once enabled online access to 500,000 objects across 90 partner institutions have been defunded (Australian Museums and Galleries, 2016; Museums & Galleries of NSW, 2014). The largest cross-collection survey—discussed in section 5.4 of this chapter—focused on collecting organisations in the State of Victoria, but the limited nature of the survey highlights the lack of identifiable material nationwide. Instead of attempting a more comprehensive survey here, the lack of material is analysed by examining the conditions under which these collections were formed. The general invisibility of queerness in museum collections will be shown in this section to result from a number of factors: the peripheral concern with social history until recently, and further marginality of queer history; destruction of material; short-lived collecting efforts; intentional hiding of material by queer communities; and lack of museum LGBTIQ collection strategies.  Museum collections began to be formed in Australia after the establishment of the Australian Museum (AM), Sydney, in 1827; by 1891, every capital city in Australia had at least one museum. Throughout most of the twentieth century, however, ‘the major  86 museums in Australia continued to focus on the collection and display of natural history and science’ (Gore, 2001, p. 45). Indeed, a comprehensive report on museums and galleries in 1933 found only three history museums in the entire country including the Australian War Museum (then in Sydney), Vaucluse House in Sydney, and the historical collections of Parliament House, Canberra (now Old Parliament House) (Markham & Richards, 1933, p. 44). The Pigott Report of 1975 noted the absence of social history up until that time and recommended that a national museum incorporating social and Indigenous history be established (section 2.2: New museology). Continuing from the 1980s, there was an increased interest in social histories and attention to their gendered, ethnic, and Indigenous exclusions. According to Viv Szekeres (2005), former director of the Migration Museum, Adelaide, the introduction of social history into museums changed them in three major ways: ‘Firstly, it has challenged the way we in museums perceive and represent knowledge. Secondly it has changed the relationship that museums have with their public. Thirdly it has changed the role of the curator from expert to intermediary’ (n.p.).  Elsewhere, Szekeres (2011) acknowledges that even given increased attention to diversity, ‘I came to realise that up until now cultural diversity had been defined as exclusively the domain of “ethnic minorities”’ (n.p.). That is, the way that the discourse of diversity and inclusion within museums had been deployed overlooked non-normative genders and sexualities. Curator at Museums Victoria, Deborah Tout-Smith, concurs that ‘cultural diversity collections in major institutions in Australia still focus on ethnicity, race, and nationality rather than the broader meanings of cultural diversity’ (cited in Davison, 2011, p. 158). Her admission comes from an organisation that has done more than most museums in Australia to include queer social history, having supported a queer collection survey (section 5.4: The Victorian Material Survey) and having a curatorial portfolio that maintains a wide conception of cultural diversity:  Cultural diversity encompasses all individual and community variations in our society, relating to self-definition and the definitions applied by others. It includes ethnicity, nationality, race, descent or ancestry, physical appearance and ability, language, age, health, location, political belief or activity, economic status, employment, industrial activity, gender and gender identity, sexual activity, marital  87 status, religious belief or activity, ideologies and personal associations (Museum Victoria, 2009).  Over and above the complexities of representing cultural diversity in museums, queer subjects face additional exclusions. The lack of relevant, identified museum collections has also partly been the consequence of intentional destruction of queer material. While many cases have been documented, perhaps the most violent example was the destruction in 1933 of the Institute for Sexology, started by German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, by the incoming Nazi Party (Figure 9). Containing a significant archive as well as material from a multidisciplinary museum, it was arguably the first museum in the world to centre on non-heterosexual, non-normative desire (Koskovich, 2014, p. 62). Though less dramatic, in Australia, according to gay historian Garry Wotherspoon (1992) relevant material ‘has been destroyed, either by authorities, who wished to deny that such behaviour existed – and therefore had a significance – or by relatives and family intent on protecting “their good name”’ (p. 153). Cases of destruction or non-collection motivated by prejudice, or the desire of museums to protect their reputations, might be other factors leading to the lack of queer material in museums.    Figure 9: The burning of books by Nazis, 10 May 1933, including thousands of books from the Institute for Sexology (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2014)   88 In other cases, collections may be lost given unsustained collecting efforts. The South Australian LGBTIQ activist Ian Purcell (2015, interview), who was consulted regarding his curation of several queer exhibitions, passed away before the thesis was completed. He housed material of the short-lived SA Gay & Lesbian Community Library and Archives and records of the AIDS Council of South Australia after it was defunded in 2013. While these records have been saved, succession in other cases is often inconsistent and unplanned, leading to the fragility of community collections. The AIDS Crisis also led to a flurry of collecting activity when ‘the spectre of literal death serve[d] as a pointed reminder of the social death of losing one’s history’ (Cvetkovich, 2003, p. 270). The historian Dino Hodge (1995a), for example, gives an affecting account of rushing to record the oral history of his friend after the latter was diagnosed with AIDS (p. 20). Especially in community contexts, many sporadic moments of collecting like the above quickly lose momentum.  Further causes of the lack of queer collections come from inadvertent and intentional destruction. As discussed in section 4.3, the Gay & Lesbian Policy Guidelines for Museum Programs and Practice (GLP) began in response to the death of queer artists as a result of AIDS, many without wills. Consequently, many works were lost or were not dispersed according to the wishes of their makers. Significant items held by individuals who do not recognise their materials as worthy of collection, who may distrust museums, or who do not make provisions for their future ownership have been lost in this way (Paul, 2016, p. 153). In another case, the records of CAMP (WA) were intentionally destroyed after the gay rights organisation was dissolved.22 A member recounts, ‘I pleaded with them.…I said, “put them in the Battye Library [an arm of the State Library of Western Australia]. Put a 50-year embargo on them if you want to. Don’t destroy them…that’s part of history!…All the minutes and all the correspondence were destroyed’ (Darbyshire, 2003a, p. 9).  The desire for queer material to remain underground, even if that requires the destruction of material, is an act of ownership and autonomy. The risks of being non-consensually ‘outed’                                                 22 CAMP (WA) was the Western Australian branch of the Campaign Against Moral Persecution. CAMP was officially formed by John Ware and Christabel Poll in July 1970. It aimed for change on two levels: the first being at the individual level to ‘throw off negative self-images’ and foster a sense of pride, and second to change public perceptions and regulation of homosexuality through the media, law, churches, and psychiatry (Wills, 1982, pp. 64–69).  89 still remain. In 2010, a NSW politician, who was married and had two sons, resigned ahead of footage of him leaving a gay sauna aired on national television. The journalist who broke the story claimed it was in the public interest, while the LGBTIQ advocate Michael Kirby accused journalists at the station of being ‘serial homophobes’ (Foschia, 2010; Hildebrand, 2010). Though the consequences of being outed are usually less harsh, the destruction of historical material evidencing LGBTIQ lives to avoid social and legal sanctions has been a common occurrence. Indeed, a recurrent issue that collecting efforts address is access restrictions relating to material that has been donated. Queer community heritage organisations like ALGA scrupulously follow access restrictions (Carbery, 1995a, p. 33), and museums have sought to do so while also encouraging public access (Museums Australia, 1999, pp. 4–5). Although it is held that queer communities have the right to decide the future of their objects and records, museums have the opportunity through sustained, sensitive engagements to develop the trust needed to care for these materials.  The final factor that explains the lack of queer collections is the absence of collection policies and strategies that are tailored to LGBTIQ material. It was argued in section 4.4 ‘Employment and networking’ that queer projects within museums are often led by queer-identified and queer-allied members of staff. Like the fragility of community collections, efforts to collect relevant material may only be sustained while motivated employees continue to drive such initiatives. Here, formal collection policies and strategic plans can play an important role as ‘[r]ather than relying on the personal preferences of the museum professionals, museums that incorporate the value of LGBT artefacts into institutional policy will have a greater likelihood of success in acquiring and sharing these materials’ (Robert, 2009, p. 47). Despite its importance, there is a policy vacuum in the area in Australia. The GLP only briefly discusses collection development, most of its guidelines surrounding ‘[s]ensitivity to the rights of the individual’ (Museums Australia, 1999, p. 4). In addition, the only known formal LGBTIQ collection strategy at a public museum is  90 contained within the Migration Museum and History Trust of South Australia’s Inclusion Action Plan, another case of leadership by these organisations (History SA, 2016b, p. 5).23  Together, the preceding factors have brought about the paucity of identified LGBTIQ collection items in Australian museums. The rest of the chapter describes strategies used by queer communities to make queerness more visible in historical collections, in particular the destabilisation of object meanings enabling queer (re)interpretations of collections.  5.2 Destabilised object meanings  The notion that objects convey stable meanings has been disrupted. Rather than the ‘transmitting of an already-existing meaning,’ museum representation and interpretation involves ‘the more active labour of making things mean’ (Hall, 1982, p. 64, emphasis in original). The current section outlines this shift in thinking that arose from the reconsideration of the museum as an instrument of modernity and categorisation. As will be shown, categorisation has problematic effects, one of which is the marginalisation of queerness. These tendencies have been scrutinised by postmodern, poststructural, and new museological intellectual movements leading to questions about the necessity of objects and collections to museums. It will be argued that objects can still be central to museums but their range of meanings must be opened up, including in queer directions.  Susan Pearce (1992)—a leading scholar of museum collections—in Museums, Objects and Collections: A Cultural Study traces the antecedents of museums today from the Renaissance collections and cabinets of curiosities of the early modern period, through the opening of the first public museums in the eighteenth century, to the postmodern museums                                                 23 Research suggests that best practice on LGBTIQ collection policies is found overseas. In particular, the extensive Collection Management Policy for the proposed National LGBT Museum, USA (Velvet Foundation, 2016)—based on that of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum—incorporates all the requirements of a comprehensive collection management policy (Malaro, 1995). It includes the following sections: introduction (with statement of purpose), acquisitions, ethics of collecting, accession procedures, loans, care and control of the collection, insurance and risk management, collections inventory, conservation, access to collections, documentation, staff code of ethics, and public disclosure.  91 from the 1950s. The first two periods—the early and classic modern periods—tied museums to the frameworks and projects of modernity:  Museums are part of the social code (or systems, or rules, or habitus) of enlightened modernity, grounded in the belief of overarching narratives which tell of the reality of scientific reason, the value of past historical experience, and the conviction that there exist realities to know about, that people are capable of knowing about them, and that they are able to use this knowledge to create better social systems (p. 233).  Categorisation was a central part of modernity. In museums and galleries during the eighteenth century, the world of things was organised into systems of categories that still resonate today. In 1727, Caspar Friedrich Neickel in Museographia divided collections into naturalia and artificialia. It remains a persistent distinction, although the triple division of naturalia into regno animali, regno vegetabili, and regno minerali—animal, vegetable, and mineral—while still bearing resemblance to contemporary divisions has led to even more extensive categorisation (Schulz, 1990, pp. 214–215). 24  The division of natural and artificial in particular evidences the binaries inherent in Western thought that Pearce (1995) set out in Figure 10. The distinction between subject and object is also especially pertinent to museum collections, encoding relations between supposedly inert collection objects and expert observers. In privileging the dimensions on the left-hand over the right-hand side, categorisation is not a neutral act. Queerness either exceeds these binaries (e.g. not being either male or female) or is demoted to produce ‘uncomfortable feelings, areas we are likely to use words like “perverted” or “deviant” to describe’ (p. 196).                                                  24 The influence of the distinction between animal, vegetable, and mineral can be seen in the early collection classification scheme of the Technological Museum, Sydney (now the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences): ‘1 – Animal products & specimens…2 – Vegetable products…3 – Waste products; 4 – Foods animal and vegetable; 5 – Economic entomology…6 – Economic geological specimens; 7 – Educational apparatus…8 – Sanitary and Hygienic appliances; 9 – Mining engineering machinery; 10 – Models drawings [sic]…11 – Agricultural Tools; 12 – Ethnological specimens; 13 – Historical furniture; 14 – Photographs, plasters, electrotype representations…15 – Exhibition catalogues, trade journals, and descriptions of new processes’ (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2013c)  92 nature : culture proper : improper moral : immoral self : other soul : body mind : matter pure : applied subject : object creator : created sensible : insensible / senseless divine : profane player : game substance : accident active : passive immaterial : material thinker : thing worker : field eternal : passing time : times knowing : known unchanging : changing person : non-person divider : divided right : left male : female Figure 10: Binaries in Western thought (Pearce, 1995, p. 161)  In Australia, the importation of Western epistemologies through settler colonialism had devastating effects on Indigenous Australians. Analysing the implication of the early colonial period of the AM in the subjugation of the First Australians, Rigg (1994) argues ‘[n]ot only did [it] provide the educative and civilizing centres for public expression but [it] promulgated the “evidence” of theories that justified expropriation of Aboriginal land and  93 at times the extermination of Aboriginal people’ (pp. 188–189), rationalised by subsuming them within the categories of natural history and portraying them as less than human (p. 190). Also bearing the pernicious effects of categorisation, LGBTIQ people in Australia have long been the object of medico-scientific scrutiny, for example through aversion therapy practiced into the 1970s that sought to ‘cure’ abnormal homosexuality.25 This regulation continues still with the surgical regulation of intersexuality and the barriers to transgender people’s agency over their bodies.26  Modernity and its way of ordering the world were problematised by various intellectual movements during the late twentieth century including postmodernism, poststructuralism, and the new museology (section 2.2). For museums, the notion that their collections were concrete, material evidence that stabilised claims to truth was increasingly viewed with suspicion. Gay art historian Douglas Crimp (1980) in On the Museum’s Ruins critiqued the idea that museum collections ‘somehow constitute a coherent representational universe.…Should the fiction disappear, there is nothing left of the Museum but “bric-a-brac,” a heap of meaningless and valueless fragments’ (as cited pp. 49–50). Similarly, within the new museology, a significant proportion of the essays in the highly influential collection The New Museology turned their attention to collections (Vergo, 1989c). Two essays, in particular, singled out the presumption that museum objects could provide unmediated knowledge to visitors. Jordanova (1989) argued that this presumption is an illusion and that ‘when we delve further into the nature of that illusion and its history, we                                                 25 Aversion therapy, a psychiatric treatment that uses electric shocks and nausea-inducing drugs, was unsuccessfully employed to cure homosexuality. A 1966 article in the Sydney Morning Herald, ‘“Learning Therapy”: A New Hope for Deviates’ described the procedure where a ‘“reward” phase dealing with the attractiveness of a woman…[was used] to encourage him to reorient his sexual feelings’ (Castellari, 1966, p. 2). It was practiced into the 1970s by therapists including Syd Lovibond and Neil McConaghy (Willett, 2000, p. 103). 26 Intersex people are born possessing sex characteristics that do not fit in the categories of male and female. Intersex children are often subject to non-consensual hormonal or surgical treatment to conform to social expectations of bodies, treatments that are increasingly considered human rights abuses (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2014b). Transgender people, conversely, often have significant barriers to receiving medical assistance to have their bodies match their gender identities.  94 are studying the history of our society’ (p. 40). Vergo (1989b) added that ‘[l]eft to speak for themselves, they often say very little’ (p. 49). The link between museum objects and their meaning was increasingly seen as fluid and perhaps arbitrary, particularly from the 1980s.  Given that museum objects could no longer support the claims they once did without challenge, the question ‘do we need collections?’ has resulted, an issue addressed in section 5.6 of this chapter. Pearce (1992) gives a cogent argument that answers ‘yes’ to the question but partly does so by dismissing ‘post-structuralist writings of men like Baudrillard, Barthes, Derrida and Foucault…[as] nihilistic in [their] denial of the possibility of meaning or reality’ (p. 232). Museum and heritage scholar Rhiannon Mason (2006) revisits the same critique but argues that the consequences that Pearce foreshadows are not automatic:  A more positive understanding of poststructuralism is to accept that the real world exists but to acknowledge that it will always be mediated by the signifying systems we inhabit. Similarly, for poststructuralist-inspired museologists to argue that the meanings of objects are inseparable from the context of their display is not the same thing as saying that they are meaningless (p. 22).  Indeed, Mason argues that museums have a renewed importance given that they provide spaces for the exploration of different semantic contexts. Museum collections can therefore emerge from the multitude of critiques of the modernist museum as a domain in which traditional meanings can be challenged. Moreover, contestations over meaning have expanded the capacity of the museum to accommodate different frameworks to interpret objects. Thus, people-based approaches can co-exist with object-based approaches, and contextual and biographical details that would once have been considered irrelevant are now increasingly central (Candlin, 2010, p. 107; Sandell, 2017b, p. 83). The destabilisation of object meaning has opened up the space to incorporate alternative frameworks such as ‘queer readings.’     95 5.3 Queer readings: What is a queer object?  Recalling that one of the senses of ‘queer’ is a critical practice ‘to make strange, to frustrate, to counteract, to delegitimise, to camp up’ (Sullivan, 2003, p. vi), an object becomes queer when the neat museological process of ‘making things mean’ is disrupted to convey queer meanings. In this way, any object has the potential to be queer. The dilemma faced is that if objects have this potential, surveying existing collections through a queer lens may be enough (see section 5.4). At the same time, various objects are more amenable to queer readings. In the first part of this section, the work of queer scholars who have turned their attention to the question ‘what is a queer object?’ will be discussed. Their provisional answer lies in the act of queer interpretations or ‘queer readings.’ In the second part, a case study of The Gay Museum will be used to argue that queer readings can be an effective way of making queerness visible despite its invisibility in existing collections.  Queer scholars have offered different suggestions as to the characteristics of queer objects and, consequently, queer collections. The issue connects to the larger concern of whether there is something distinctive about queerness. The literature on queer objects in museums displays two overlapping strands, the first being that ‘queer’ objects are often everyday objects that become queer through interpretation. Thus, Tyburczy (2015) emphasises quotidian objects or ‘realia’ in the Leather Archives and Museum, Chicago, that become associated with queer individuals: ‘Realia is defined as an object from real life, in contrast to those objects typically included in an archive or museum collection…[including] artifacts, ephemera, bric-a-brac, found objects, or memorabilia’ (p. 196).  The second perspective suggests that queer material culture may have a culturally specific ontology. Hence, the eclectic appropriation of everyday objects, especially the ‘old-fashioned, out-of-date, démodé,’ was said by American public intellectual Susan Sontag (1964) in ‘Notes on “Camp”’ to constitute the camp aesthetic. The second perspective on queer objects contends that queer material culture is distinct, proceeding from the idea that ‘[b]eing gay would seem to involve an entire attitude and set of values, an entire cultural orientation’ (Halperin, 2012, p. 10, emphasis in original). According to José Esteban Muñoz (1996), queerness is often ephemeral, existing as ‘innuendo, gossip, fleeting moment and performances that…evaporat[e] at the touch of those who would eliminate  96 queer possibility’ (p. 6). Hence, objects that reflect the sociosexual and political activities of queer communities—for example, t-shirts, costumes, banners, badges, and sex objects—are now selected for inclusion in institutional repositories. The simultaneous everydayness and distinctiveness of queer objects makes their meanings fluid, though remain tied to the significance accorded to them by queer communities (Figure 11).   Figure 11: ‘Lesbian’ boot prop from the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Displayed in Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney at the Liverpool Regional Museum (8 February–31 March 2001). Image courtesy of Liverpool City Council  Queer readings can draw on the tension between the above two perspectives productively. While they may take interest in the ontology of queerness, their meanings cannot be resolved for all times and places. Queer artist Matt Smith (2015) developed the concept of ‘visual Polari’ using ‘subject matter, visual styles, ways of making, ways of displaying and areas for display’ in order to make queer-coded references in museums and galleries.27 Responding to the potential charge of essentialism, he counters that ‘[t]his identification                                                 27 Polari was a slang language used in gay subculture to conceal meaning except to those familiar with its idiom (Baker, 2002).  97 will by its very nature be partial, selective and open to debate’ (p. 65). It is argued that increasing the potential for queer readings in collections—either through re-interpreting existing material or collecting new material—can acknowledge the irresolvable complexity of the question ‘what is a queer object?’ while enabling greater inclusion. Attempts at proliferating queer readings have been undertaken most thoroughly by queer artists.  Turning to the second part of the section, the queer reading practices undertaken in The Gay Museum: An Exhibition Exploring the History of Lesbian and Gay Presence in Western Australia (22 January–16 March 2003) will now be investigated to demonstrate their utility in queering existing collections (Figure 12). As with most museum collections in Australia, the collection of the Western Australian Museum, Perth, has few or no identified LGBTIQ items. At face value, telling queer narratives in the museum is prohibitively difficult. The queer reading practices used by artist and curator Jo Darbyshire in the exhibition The Gay Museum, however, show that queer meanings can be conveyed through using seemingly non-queer objects. Queer readings, not just by artists, are fruitful in disrupting queer invisibility. At the same time, they participate in the critique of traditional interpretive methods that have worked to produce that invisibility.   Figure 12: ‘Gay’ sign in front of the Western Australian Museum as part of The Gay Museum exhibition (22 January–16 March 2003). Image courtesy of Jo Darbyshire   98 In Australian Artists in the Contemporary Museum, Barrett and Millner (2014) survey the works and exhibitions of Australian artists who engage with and critique museums. The strategies the artists use include ‘undertaking post-colonial readings, ordering and interpreting sites and collections according to different curatorial criteria, and forging new relationships to historical artefacts and natural specimens through embracing their aesthetic power’ (p. 133). As part of a Masters of Creative Arts in Cultural Heritage programme at Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Darbyshire (2003b) used her skills as an artist in The Gay Museum to reinterpret the Western Australian Museum collection ‘according to a different curatorial criteria’ in order to mitigate the invisibility of queerness. Working from the position where no entries were found in its database after a search for ‘gay,’ ‘lesbian,’ or ‘homosexual’ (p. 63), she appropriated seemingly unrelated objects from the museum collection and constructed queer meanings around them.  Examples in the exhibition include the juxtaposition of a powder puff next to a discussion of the derogatory Australian term ‘poofter’ which is etymologically derived from these objects; an electroconvulsive therapy machine next to 60 pieces of soap to explain the failed attempts to impose moral hygiene through medical science; and a glove puppet of a policeman with unusually red lips placed next to oral history segments recounting police harassment and arrests. Darbyshire as an artist and curator departed from the standard ways in which museum objects come to have meaning through specialist knowledge, conventional historical interpretation, and the binaries shown in Figure 10, all results of modernist museum approaches. By doing so, she highlights the constructed nature of these knowledges rather than accepting their claims to objectivity:  I realised that interpretation, or being able to transfer some of my visual skills and perceptions of looking and making metaphorical or symbolic meaning out of things, was something that could open up dialogue in the museum because I was told that the museum only really put things on display in terms of provenance or functionality: what something was used for or who it belonged to was the reason for its meaning, rather than any symbolic or metaphorical meaning. I realised that this meaning was indeed being used but very subtly and people didn’t notice that they were doing it; they were doing it in terms of nomenclature in particular. I realised that the museum did interpret things in this symbolic way, or in a kind of social,  99 cultural way but that it didn’t admit it and didn’t recognise the power of it (cited in Barrett & Millner, 2014, p. 89).  One of the systems of categorisation that function in this ‘symbolic…social, cultural way’ is natural history taxonomies. In the exhibition, she mimicked their rationalising tendency by attempting to order forks according to the following taxa: kingdom – hard things; class – steel objects; order – utensil; family – fork; genus – domestic; species – metal stemmed; subspecies – plain round base (Wilson, 2003) (Figure 13). This is a parody of the Linnaean taxonomic system which was outlined by Carl Linnaeus in Systema Naturæ in 1735 and that soon afterwards influenced the ordering of museum collections. While humorous, she states that ‘I felt I was not irreverent. Rather, I hoped to open up new meanings…to re-invigorate objects from museum collections’ (Darbyshire, 2003c, p. 2).   Figure 13: Jo Darbyshire’s taxonomy of forks in The Gay Museum exhibition (22 January–16 March 2003) at the Western Australian Museum. Image courtesy of Jo Darbyshire  There were some disagreements over the methods used by Darbyshire. The museum was initially uncertain that her aims were congruent with those of the museum, and therefore sufficient for the project to go ahead (Barrett & Millner, 2014, p. 89). After the project  100 started, some of the museum staff ‘found it difficult to facilitate me “browsing” in their collections’ (Darbyshire, 2003b, p. 65). There was also initial resistance from the natural history departments to being involved with a perceived ‘social history exhibition’ (p. 71), another division that echoes the separation of nature and culture that has been in place since the birth of the modernist museum. Former curator at the museum, Mathew Trinca, was able to act as a mediator on these issues, again illustrating the importance of queer allies and insiders (section 4.4). Undertaking queer readings cuts across museum conventions including the recognition of specialist authority and disciplinary boundaries, in this case art and science, and science and the humanities. However, the critical commentary around The Gay Museum and artist interventions in museums show the benefits of pursuing such boundary crossing. As Barrett and Millner (2014) argue, ‘it is often in this culture clash that the benefits of artist-museum collaborations lie, when the practices and underlying belief systems of each are thrown into sharp relief and openly examined as a result’ (p. 134). Differences required negotiation which resulted in value for both parties: the museum was able to counter its queer invisibility underpinned by its historical practices; and Darbyshire (2003c) was ‘able to reach and perhaps move people that normally would rather chew their arms off than go into an art gallery’ (p. 1).  Queering collections through the use of queer readings brings together several strands in the chapter so far. Starting from the observation that queerness is invisible in collections, it participates in the contemporary attention that is paid to the contextual nature of object meanings. As The Gay Museum shows, a queer perspective on museum collection practices reveals what—and who—falls in between the disciplines, categories, and taxonomies that continue to influence museum practice. It suggests that queer readings present a playful way of queering existing collections that appear, on their face, as having no such resonances. As the next section will show, queer readings can be used in collection surveys to identify relevant material.  5.4 The Victorian Material Survey  Rather than dismissing silence as absent voices that should be present, consideration is given to how these “queer silences” are also moments of disclosure (Gorman-Murray, Johnston, & Waitt, 2010, p. 103).  101  Queer meanings have been shown to be a potential in any existing museum collection. The current section expands on the notion that ‘queer silences’ are also moments of disclosure, and shows how attentive collection surveys, in conjunction with collecting new material, can lead to such moments. An examination of the Victorian ‘Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Material Survey’ (VMS), which searched for relevant material in the Museum Victoria collection and others, will demonstrate that collection surveys are central to queering existing collections. They do so by acknowledging the conventions surrounding museum collections while also expanding them to accommodate queer readings.  The collection of Museum Victoria, the amalgamated museum body of the State of Victoria, was one of the primary sites of the survey. Though formed in 1983, the institutions that it brought together were established from 1854. A historian of the organisation, Carolyn Rasmussen (2001), reviews the dramatic change in the museum over that time, commenting that ‘[e]ach generation configures that distillation of knowledge differently.…None of the objects has meaning detached from the knowledge that caused them to be collected’ (p. 4). 1983 marked the turn towards social history undertaken by the museum when there was perceived to be ‘the need to re-evaluate such material as was already within [museum collections]’ (p. 323). The emerging interweaving of the state’s natural and human history was ‘a response to intellectual challenges posed by social history, postcolonialism and environmentalism’ (McShane, 2006, p. 7.1). Museum Victoria then has always been re-interpreting its collection to renew its relevance and significance to the people of Victoria. Indeed, feminist philosopher Hilde Hein (2000) observes that in this constant flux, ‘[w]hat is common to museum objects throughout centuries of collection and exhibition, then, is not their material history, but the mutations of interpretative fashion’ (p. 62). Hein’s observation is a salient response to the suggestion that reinterpretation from a queer perspective is markedly different from what has happened continuously over the history of museums and Museum Victoria.  The VMS was the joint initiative of Museum Victoria, ALGA, the State Library of Victoria, and other public and community-based collecting organisations to identify queer material. It was conducted part-time over six months in 2005 by two paid staff, and remains significant in being the largest queer collection survey in Australia and one of the few  102 examples worldwide. 28  The chief investigator of the project, Kate Davison (2015, interview), argued that silences are more an issue with documentation than of presence in the collection:   The problem with historical material is less with the stuff that is collected now and more with stuff that has been previously collected in past lives before attention to queer history really arose.…[These materials] have been catalogued in older ways that don’t pay attention to social identity.  Uncovering potential queer material in the Museum Victoria collection was beset by many problems. Not only did the documentation of most material collected before the 1980s fail to reflect the increased interest in Australian social history, but queer material faced additional problems. Beyond the issues raised in section 5.1 ‘Where are the queer collections?’ the first of these is the rapidly changing historical configurations of identities and practices grouped under ‘queer.’ Over the history of the museum’s collection, queer lives have been influenced by the medicalised terminology of ‘homosexuality’ starting in the late nineteenth century, the particular Australian formulation of ‘camp’ culture until ‘gay’ became widely used in the 1970s, and finally the reclamation of ‘queer’ which became influential in the 1990s (Reynolds, 2002). Nonetheless, there is not a neat procession of terms—all are still used in different contexts—but it does indicate the difficulty of searching collections for queer resonances that have been encoded in multitudinous and historically specific ways.  A second issue concerns the effect of describing collection items as ‘queer.’ Philosopher and social theorist Michel Foucault writes in the influential book The History of Sexuality: Volume I (1978) that ‘the psychological, psychiatric, medical category of homosexuality was constituted from the moment it was characterized’ (p. 43). Relatedly, in the preface to The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences, he highlights the relativity of these categories by citing ‘a certain Chinese encyclopaedia’ according to Jorge Luis Borges that divided animals into those ‘(a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d)                                                 28 Another example of a cross-institutional collection survey was undertaken by the UK-based group Proud Heritage which distributed a survey through the peak professional museum body, Museums Association (Honigsbaum, 2005).  103 sucking pigs, (e) fabulous’ and so on (Foucault, 1970, p. xvi). Thus, in the Foucauldian framework, naming an object as ‘queer’ discursively produces its queerness in a historically and culturally conditioned manner. While it may appear to be a manipulative exercise, objects are always-already understood through some interpretive system. Queer interventions in collections work by ‘seizing these rules…pervert[ing] them, [and] invert[ing] their meaning’ in order to increase queer visibility (Hooper-Greenhill, 1992, p. 215).  The methodology developed for the VMS responded to the above issues, first by surveying an open-ended range of historically specific markers. Second, it was concerned with relevance rather than identifying categorically ‘queer objects.’ Davison (2015, interview) states ‘you can’t simply look at a cup and say “this is a gay cup.” There is no such thing as a gay cup. It was a cup that was used by a gay person, maybe, or it was a cup that was sculpted by a gay person, maybe, or it was a cup that has imagery on it that has a gay association.’ It entails another response to the question ‘what is a queer object?’ that was discussed in section 5.3, one that is concerned with queer relevance rather than the ontology of queer objects. Rather, a multi-tiered classification system was developed to categorise forms of queer relevance:  a) orientation (direct relevance, eg identified individuals, material containing the words lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or other historically specific terminology such as camp) b) association (eg, icons or public figures, individuals associated with lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender communities) c) sensibility (symbolism, potential for subtext and queer readings, eg the dice [sic] in the WA Gay Museum) (Davison, 2006, p. 12).  Class (a) ‘orientation’ addresses the first issue discussed above on the difficulty of finding a unifying principle for queer objects. In appealing to ‘direct relevance,’ the methodology incorporates conventions around museum collections that privilege provenance, authenticity, and rarity. Davison (2015, interview) stated the need to work with collection conventions at the same time as recasting them: ‘there’s a massively high premium in museums placed on provenance, direct provenance. However, with queer history…you  104 need to have more porous boundaries.’ One of the ways that the VMS did so was to broaden the search terms used to define relevant material. Because it ‘erred on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion,’ perhaps unexpected terms such as ‘pervert/ersion,’ ‘suffragette,’ ‘sapphists’ were included as historical terms applied to disruptive, non-normative behaviour (Davison, 2006, pp. 12–17).  Class (b) ‘association’ is more distant in regard to provenance but still of queer relevance. Terms above like ‘suffragette’ are arguably unusual additions because advocating for the right for women to vote has no necessary LGBTIQ connection, but there are many potential links between feminist and sexual politics and, of course, some suffragettes were also lovers of women.29 In that sense, ‘suffragette’ is relevant to the VMS as a way of keeping open the potential for queer connections to be formed.  The last class (c) ‘sensibility’ is the most fluid of all, and pulls furthest away from provenance-based museum approaches. While the movement from (a) to (b) to (c) can be seen as further degrees of removal from direct provenance, it is affirmed that there is not a hierarchy of relevance as it lies equally in all the categories. Davison gives the example of the bone die recovered from the shipwreck Zeewijk that was featured in the exhibition The Gay Museum. The ship operated by the Dutch East India Company was wrecked off the coast of Western Australia in 1727. Two boys from the surviving party, Adriaen Spoor and Pieter Engels, were caught committing the ‘abominable and god-forsaken deeds of Sodom and Gomorrah.’ They were marooned on separate coral islands and left to die (Darbyshire, 2003a, pp. 6–7). The die then has no direct connection with the unfortunate pair other than being on the same vessel. As seen in the previous section, the connection is sufficient to undertake a queer reading of the object. Using the tiered methodology, the VMS increased the number of objects of ‘lesbian and gay’ relevance from nine to over 148 with 80 additional objects with relevance to feminism and sexuality (Davison, 2011, p. 157).  While only a short project, the VMS is the sole cross-collection survey that has involved a large public museum in Australia. Among the resulting report’s recommendations was the                                                 29 For example, at Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, Chicago, the loving relationship between the suffragette Jane Addams and Mary Rozet Smith is now subject to interpretation within the museum, as noted in section 2.3 (Lee, 2011; Schoenberg, 2007).  105 development of a large-scale LGBTIQ exhibition at Museum Victoria, and the undertaking of a national material survey (Davison, 2006, p. 23). Neither recommendation has been acted upon leading the project investigator to characterise the impact of the report as ‘zero, nothing. Arguably nothing because [LGBTIQ inclusion] would have happened report or no’ (Davison, 2015, interview). However, one of the lasting contributions of the VMS is its methodology, as well as the queer material identified. The debate that occurred over the validity of the methodology, which will now be discussed, is emblematic of criticisms levelled at queer historical methods.  5.4.1 Criticisms  The methodology of the VMS was flexible enough to respond to the particularities of the queer material record by introducing different categories of queer relevance. Its approach to historical material departs from methods that have been largely heteronormative, based upon assuming heterosexuality until proven otherwise, and hence reproducing silence around sexuality (see Figure 2, pp. 3–5). This section examines the dispute that occurred between Davison, the author of the VMS report, and the historian Bev Roberts. Roberts considered the inclusion of a teapot that belonged to Caroline Elizabeth Newcomb (1812–1874) in the VMS to be historically inaccurate (Figure 14). Newcomb was an early pioneer squatter of Tasmania having emigrated to Hobart in 1833 and managed a farm with Anne Drysdale (1792–1853). The dispute lay over interpretation of the closeness of the relationship between Newcomb and Drysdale who lived together right up until the latter’s death in 1853. Examining the dispute can validate queer interpretive methods by unveiling the heteronormative assumptions that often underlie objections to queer readings.   106  Figure 14: Teapot awarded to Caroline Elizabeth Newcomb (1812–1874). Image courtesy of Museum Victoria  Roberts (2011) argues that the women, through the inclusion of the teapot in the VMS, had been ‘characterised as homosexual [sic], apparently on the basis of anachronistic interpretations of their relationship’ (p. 76).30 In reviewing the limited historical material on the pair including Drysdale’s diary where she referred to ‘Miss Newcomb, my partner, I hope, for life’ when she came to reside at the farm, Roberts writes that ‘[o]nly a determinedly ahistorical interpretation could construe these comments as anything other than evidence of a strong and affectionate friendship’ (ibid.). In response to the criticism, Davison (2015, interview) counters, ‘Bev Roberts…was trying to say that I had run roughshod over this quite nuanced debate about how to interpret lifelong women’s friendships and [she] was disputing the idea that the teapot has relevance for queer history in Victoria.’  Positioning of relationships such as Newcomb and Drysdale’s as either platonic or potentially romantic has an effect on the queer representation of the collection. Roberts’s approach to the historical material leads to another instance of queer silencing. In asserting                                                 30 ‘Homosexual’ is increasingly viewed as an insensitive term given its role in medicalising and pathologising a set of practices that it came to group under the category. While some LGBTIQ people still identify as homosexuals, its use by non-queer people is often oblivious of its history.  107 that ‘in the absence of evidence, there can only be speculation about the sexuality of Miss Drysdale and Miss Newcomb, and this would be futile as well as pointless’ (p. 77), she effectively renders the (c) ‘sensibility’ class of objects identified using the VMS methodology as invalid. However, it is reasonable to say that the contemporary eye is likely to query the straightness of the relationship, providing an opportunity at the very least to discuss intimate relationships between women through time. As a category devised to demarcate relevance—as opposed to providing absolute proof—objects expressing a ‘sensibility’ leave open and do not foreclose the possibility that empirical evidence of the sort that Roberts will admit will be found. More likely, such evidence will always be dormant in collections because of lack of documentation or because, as with many museum objects, it was not collected in the first place. In all these scenarios, however, the Newcomb teapot is relevant.  Roberts’s claim that Davison’s reading is ‘futile as well as pointless,’ and her dismissal of the queer reading of the teapot as ‘speculative,’ is a common criticism of queer historical methods. However, queer readings have been shown to be a necessary response to invisibility in museum collections where ‘[w]ho is / isn’t a same-sex lover remains a battle zone between those who want to speak and those who prefer silence’ (Featherstone, 2013, p. 84; Petry, 2004, p. 10). Reading against the grain of Robert’s arguments, the same questions can be asked of her preferred approach to historical material. In challenging the relevance of the teapot to the VMS, Roberts asked for a justification from Museum Victoria and received the following reply:  As there is no evidence…that they did not have a sexual relationship (unless the enquirer has found some herself that she can supply us with) to the contrary, I think there is no reason to remove the GLBT reference (cited in Roberts, 2011, p. 77; emphasis in original).  While the relationship between Drysdale and Newcomb might be better framed in terms of intimacy and perhaps Adrienne Rich’s ‘lesbian continuum’ instead of a sexual  108 relationship,31 the strategy of turning the question around is productive. Such a move does not automatically make an object queer, but it makes us attune to how heterosexuality operates as an unmarked default that seemingly requires no evidence. The reply from Museum Victoria overturns the presumption of heterosexuality and places the assumption itself under scrutiny.  The influence of other assumptions can also be seen in Roberts’s interpretation of the relationship between Drysdale and Newcomb. Referring to the late marriage of Caroline Newcomb at the age of 49 and after the death of Anne Drysdale, Roberts (2011) writes that previously she ‘was either not looking for a husband or did not find the husband she was looking for’ (p. 78). In considering only two possibilities, Roberts ignores the possibility that Newcomb was romantically attracted to women. Further, in referring to ‘the prudent Scot [Drysdale] and the fervent Methodist [Newcomb]’ as an explanation for why their relationship should be considered a friendship (p. 84), she assumes that religious beliefs give an adequate account of attitudes to same-sex intimacy. Roberts can be seen as entering a speculative mode as much as the suggestion that the teapot has queer relevance. Double standards often surround LGBTIQ scholarship: Australian gay and lesbian historian Clive Moore observes that ‘[h]istorical proof of heterosexuality does not rely on proof of genital contact – it is presumed as a norm. Yet this identification of lesbians and gay men often revolves around proof of genital contact and penetration’ (Moore, 2001, pp. 15–16).  Queer readings are effective at disrupting the history of silence around sexuality in museum collections. As suggested in the multi-tiered approach of the VMS, they exist alongside the historiographic approaches favoured by museums. Part of the rationale behind this co-existence is to keep the meaning of objects open, not to supplant existing understandings of objects, but rather add possible layers of interpretation that visitors can affirm or deny (Sandell et al., 2010, pp. 29–30). As queer theorist Annamarie Jagose (1996) explains, ‘[a]lthough frequently described as aggressive, queer is also tentative. Its suspicion of…totalising explanatory narratives necessarily limits its own claims’ (p. 126). A possible                                                 31 In the seminal essay ‘Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Experience,’ American feminist Adrienne Rich (1980) explained, ‘I mean the term lesbian continuum to include a range—through each woman's life and throughout history—of woman-identified experience; not simply the fact that a woman has had or consciously desired genital sexual experience with another woman’ (p. 648).  109 response to critics like Bev Roberts is to outline the historical conditions that have produced queer invisibility, as well as communicating the importance of tentative, honest speculation. Examining LGBTIQ heritage sites, Taylor (2011) writes about the ‘undeniable conjecture’ involved in queer interpretation and how acknowledging its necessity ‘would infuse our sites with a great deal more relevancy’ (p. 12). Queer collection surveys—simultaneously working with and beyond institutional approaches—make existing museum collections more relevant to queer communities. They reinterpret existing collections in order to increase their queer relevance. Adding new material, including through oral history collection, is a necessary accompanying process.  5.5 Queer oral histories  Collecting oral histories is a potent way of redressing queer silence by adding new material to museum collections. Although queer communities have placed much importance on recording oral histories, as will be discussed, they are often seen as too subjective for use as historical evidence. Furthermore, their immateriality presents difficulties when it comes to crafting engaging exhibition experiences. However, it will be argued that these issues can be addressed and are outweighed by the importance placed on oral histories by queer communities.  Collecting oral histories has been central to the preservation of LGBTIQ narratives. Studying queer archives, Cvetkovich (2003) states that ‘[i]n the absence of institutionalized documentation…memory becomes a valuable historical resource…alongside the documents of the dominant culture’ (p. 8). The conditions that have led to the absence and invisibility of queer collections discussed in the chapter have made collecting new material essential:  [Q]ueer and feminist oral history methods commit to the creation of new material, new sources, and new records. Unlike researchers who choose to work with special collections of well-preserved documents, those who study women, queers, and—we might add—other subaltern groups such as communities of color and migrant workers by and large have had to start from scratch: where no documents or acid- 110 free folders existed, researchers set out to create them (Ramírez & Boyd, 2012, p. 5).  In Australia, oral histories have been central to documenting and interpreting LGBTIQ histories.32 Hodge (1993) used 20 oral histories to write the most comprehensive history of homosexuality in the Northern Territory to date, explaining that the ‘descriptive approach of oral history is an effective tool in documenting a hidden and protected history’ (p. i). More recently, Jennings (2015) has written the first book focusing on the lesbian history of Sydney by undertaking 22 oral histories and drawing on existing oral histories (p. xviii), and the Australian Lesbian and Gay Life Stories project recorded 60 oral histories that were deposited with the National Library of Australia (Reynolds & Robinson, 2014). Innovative efforts to present oral histories have also been undertaken by projects such as 100 Voices, which made available online excerpts from 100 oral histories relating to LGBTIQ life in Sydney (Pride History Group, 2013). It is clear that in the absence or invisibility of relevant material in public repositories, queer communities and researchers have adopted the responsibility to preserve their own histories.  In general, oral histories are on the periphery of museum practice, often considered part of behind-the-scenes research that are thereafter consigned to audio-visual libraries (Chew, 2012; Gould, 2016). When they are included in exhibits they are often perceived as ‘at best, a useful adjunct to the material object collections’ or ‘transformed into text on walls, and consequently [losing] the multi-layered complexities and entrancing vigour of oral narration’ (Green, 2007, p. 410). However, Australian exhibitions that have incorporated queer oral histories demonstrate that they can be integrated effectively. Prejudice and Pride that was mounted at the Museum of Brisbane (2010b) successfully incorporated 20 oral histories alongside more traditional text panels and object displays (section 6.2.2), and Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney captured the complexity of the interviewee narratives by juxtaposing interviews with photographic portraits (section 7.4). The small degree to which queer oral histories have been incorporated into Australian                                                 32 Oral histories have become central to other groups who have a transient, undocumented material culture or a strong oral tradition. Migration histories, for example, are heavily reliant on them, which is reflected in the collection strategies of the Migration Museum, Adelaide, and the Immigration Museum, Melbourne (Henrich, 2011, pp. 76–77; Szekeres, 1987).  111 exhibitions stands in contrast to the importance accorded to them by queer researchers and communities. Indeed, the UK-based queer museologist Sean Curran (2014) argues that ‘[b]eyond actively collecting material…and interrogating existing collections…oral histories are perhaps the best way for museums to engage with the communities they seek to represent’ (pp. 346–347). Investigating the gap between museum and community valuations may assist in aligning them.  The first issue that is often raised in relation to oral histories is their validity as historical evidence (Perks & Thomson, 2016; Thomson, Frisch, & Hamilton, 1994, pp. 33–34). As seen previously, the same argument has been directed at queer readings used to interpret or survey objects in museum collections. One response to the critique of the VMS (section 5.4.1) was to reveal the double standards by which one interpretation is labelled speculative while another is considered valid historical reasoning. A similar tactic can be used to reply to the marginalising of oral histories on the grounds of their subjectivity. Robert (2016) argues that ‘oral narratives are a first-person account not unlike other archival texts, such as letters, newspaper accounts and memoirs’ (p. 115). Another reply from oral historians positions the subjectivity of oral histories as a strength. Gay and lesbian historians have in the past downplayed the subjective nature of their findings to legitimise their field and in their haste to record ‘facts’ as members of the community passed away. Lesbian feminist Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy (1994), author of the pioneering study Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold on pre-Stonewall lesbian communities in Buffalo, New York, admits to doing so. However, she reflects that in the past fifteen years, ‘oral historians have come to understand the subjectivity and orality of their sources as a strength rather than a weakness’ (Kennedy, 2006, p. 272). She comes to the conclusion that ‘gay and lesbian oral history is at a point where, to grow, it needs to fully embrace the subjective and oral nature of its documents. By doing so, its “empirical” goals are not compromised but expanded’ (p. 281; emphasis added). Like queer readings and contemporary approaches to object meaning, queer oral histories do not claim to represent singular universal narratives. Moreover, in being methodologically aware of ‘silences, omissions and gaps,’ they have the potential to supplement conventional histories with first-hand account of queer experience (Marshall, 2012, p. 180).   112 A second issue that prevents the further incorporation of oral histories is the perception that they are not suited to well-crafted museum experiences. Curatorial researcher at the Institute of Texan Cultures, Sarah Gould (2016), gives a cogent outline of the challenges that museum workers face when exhibiting oral histories:  How do we inspire in our visitors the patience to listen? How do we deliver sound in a way that works for most visitors and doesn’t distract others who are trying to focus elsewhere? Does too much audio or video overwhelm visitors? Are speakers and audio cones more likely to make a visitor stop and listen than a handheld audio wand or headphones? Is the “talking head” visually boring? Does it help to add photos or other graphics? If we add photos or other graphics to an oral history video are we distracting from the person’s words? Similarly, are we overmanipulating an oral history when we select clips and edit them into a slick two-minute video with animated graphics? (n.p.)  These are essential and difficult considerations which few exhibitions have dealt with successfully. The exhibition Edges mentioned above was able to convey the complexities of the interviewees’ narratives while offering a compelling audience experience, one reviewer expressing that it was ‘[t]hought provoking, funny and serious’ (“Living on the Edge,” 2001, p. 15). Similarly, historian Anna Green (2007) recounts how she navigated the issues in curating an exhibition entirely based around oral histories, namely ‘making the oral history accessible and audible, while minimising sound bleed in a relatively open-plan exhibition’ (p. 411). She concludes that ‘[p]eople will sit and listen if the stories interest them and the environment is comfortable and inviting. There is no need to banish oral history to the walls, listening posts, booths [or] earphones’ (p. 416). Exhibitions where oral histories have been integrated effectively illustrate that appealing museum visitor experiences are possible given user-centred, creative practice. However, perhaps more than other areas of exhibition development, incorporating audiovisual material requires close collaboration between exhibition designers and content producers (Reddick & Stefancic, 2014, p. 340).  Both the issues raised that discourage the further use of oral histories in museums can be addressed. Through collecting and exhibiting oral histories on an equal basis to object- 113 based collecting, museums can accord them the same significance that queer communities place upon them, literally including queer voices where once there had been silence. Thus, adding new material into museum collections, alongside re-interpreting existing collections, forms an integrated strategy to queering museum collections. Queer communities and their heritage organisations, however, have undertaken other interventions that interrogate the need for primarily object-based and permanent collections through pop-up museums and online projects. It begs the question of whether objects and collections are needed at all.  5.6 Are objects and collections needed?  Developments in the chapter lead to a question on the need for museum objects and collections: due to the current emphasis on subject(ivity) over object(ivity), multiple meanings, and narrative, are they now redundant? In this section, the necessity of object-based and permanent collections will be considered to make the case for their continuing value. Emerging literature suggests that attention to (queer) subjectivity does not need to be at the expense of engagement with materiality. Further, while pop-up museums and online museums challenge the idea that permanent collections are required, a case study of the Mardi Gras Museum will show that temporary efforts are seen by communities as inferior to permanence. It is put forward that permanent, object-based collections are still essential but they must expand their conventions to accommodate the visibility strategies of queer communities.  The projects discussed in the chapter used museum collection practices as a starting point for revision. Queer readings render the meaning of objects exceptionally fluid, destabilising the link between objects and meaning. In a sense, the semiotic play of queer readings does not require physical objects or collections of them. In addition, oral histories expand collections in immaterial directions. To a large degree, museum practice has been able to accommodate the increasing importance of immaterial dimensions of collections. For example, Robert (2016) develops the idea that queer digital stories are a kind of ‘evocative object’ that ‘expand[s] both the materiality and the possibilities of artifact-based histories’ (p. 181). Various curators at the National Museum of Australia have also taken objects to ‘include things, images, media and text objects’ (Wehner & Sear, 2010, p. 143). Furthermore, recent scholarship within museum studies that refocuses on the materiality of  114 objects provides conceptual support for the continued centrality of physical collections. While the continuing value of object-based collections should be acknowledged, the impact that different cultural frameworks have on meaning should also be kept within view. This literature will now be discussed, focusing on its careful navigation of subject-object interactions in ways attuned to materiality while avoiding essentialism.  Museum scholar Sandra Dudley has reinvigorated work emphasising the inherent materiality of museum collections to which visitors have affective and sensorial responses. She argues that the drive to recognise the subjective aspects of our encounters with museum objects has diminished attention to materiality. Objects, in this view, become ‘useless and redundant…only hav[ing] significance as part of an object-information package’ (Dudley, 2012a), and only valuable because of the ‘cultural meanings that overlie them and as a result of the real or imagined stories which they can be used to construct’ (Dudley, 2010, p. 3). Arguably illustrating such an approach, when the National Museum of Australia (NMA) was opened in 2001 it was described by its director as a ‘forum, a place for dialogue and debate’ (Casey, 2001, p. 6). Curators of the NMA later reflected that ‘[a]s words had been privileged as carriers of meaning in the Museum, the objects had become passive and consequently bland and uninteresting’ (Wehner & Sear, 2010, p. 145). While understanding museums in terms of texts and narratives can reveal ‘unintentional meanings, omissions, or contradictions present within displays,’ they can also potentially sideline the experiential encounters between audiences and objects (Mason, 2006, pp. 27–28).  Of course, emphasising the subjectivity inherent in encounters with museum collections was fundamental to redressing the historical biases and exclusions from museums. The binaries that shaped museum collections—‘subject / object’ and ‘proper / improper’ to take just two (Figure 10)—positioned museums and their collections as institutions of truth and objectivity. Queer, postcolonial, and feminist critiques would undermine singular truth claims, and reinterpret silences within museum collections on their own terms including through queer readings, ironically finding that ‘[a]s keepers of objects, museums thus turned out to be depositories of subjectivity’ (Dubin, 2006, p. 479; Hein, 2000, p. 76). Literature re-centring materiality has been careful to avoid dismissing these challenges and attracting accusations of elitism and essentialism:   115 I am not trying to claim that the social, cultural, historical and scientific meanings, values and contexts of things are unimportant.…My argument is that, frequently, museums and visitors alike are so concerned with information—with the story overlying the physical thing—that they can inadvertently close off other, perhaps equally significant potentials of things (Dudley, 2012a, pp. 4–5).  The ‘potentials of things’ is consistent with the idea that particular objects are more amenable to queer readings; each is a potential rather than an essential characteristic (Morphy, 2010, p. 285). Dudley’s (2012c) position is attuned to materiality but avoids essentialism, as does her argument that ‘[i]t is in the engagement between object and subject, in their very confluence, that sensory responses, emotions and ideas are generated…that subjects and objects come fully into being at all’ (p. 8). Viewing queer objects could be said, then, to mutually constitute the objects and individuals as queer. As museum learning theorist George Hein (2000) establishes, ‘societies construct selves correlatively with their construction and acquisition of objects, thereby creating a reality in which people and objects are mutually constituted’ (p. 54). Despite the interrogation of various foundational tenets of collections in the chapter, museums and visitors still attribute significance to ‘the real thing’ (Hein, 2000, p. 87; Latham, 2015, p. 17).  Perhaps surprisingly, the continuing attachment of audiences to objects is illustrated through online and virtual museums. The Unstraight Museum, Sweden, was founded in 2011 and invites users to upload objects and stories significant to them and LGBTIQ histories (The Unstraight Museum, 2012). In creating an online database of objects while keeping the objects within their original contexts, the Unstraight Museum highlights the role of objects in everyday life while also displacing the expectation that museums will seek to have physical control over them through their collections or loans. The Migration Heritage Centre (MHC) based at the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (MAAS), Sydney, similarly, was ‘founded as “a museum without walls” and a virtual heritage centre’ (Peterson, 2012). Images of objects, selected by migrants to New South Wales, were displayed alongside narratives of their significance. The objects, however, would remain in their community contexts. Like the Unstraight Museum, the MHC ‘invite[d] internet audiences to interact with the material form of the objects through description and through viewing’ (Wilton, 2009, p. 2). Although recognising the unique affordances of new  116 media—their 24/7 worldwide accessibility, non-linearity, and participatory nature—paradoxically, online experiences can also ‘re-enchant’ objects, ultimately leading attention back to museum collections (Starn, 2005, p. 83). In the case of the MHC, it has been reported that a virtual museum was used to avert the cost of physical, separate ethnic museums (Peterson, 2012); and, although unsuccessful, a physical museum of immigration and multiculturalism has been proposed (Robins, 2011). Online museums, here, should not replace physical encounters but rather augment them. Therefore, it is maintained that the persistent power of objects to be involved in meaning-making, identity formation, and community building continues to make them a potent resource to signify presence within museums and society.  The second notion of collections that has been questioned by alternative ways of using objects in public displays is their permanence. Online museums discussed above indicate that the participatory and accessible experiences increasingly expected of museums can be satisfied without it. However, another newer museum format, pop-up museums, shows that LGBTIQ communities can see temporariness of heritage projects as inferior to permanence. The pop-up concept is most familiar in the retail setting where it involves the temporary presence of a store. A recent application of the idea to museums was undertaken by Michelle DelCarlo. She defines a pop-up as ‘a participatory community event where people share a personal object, based on a theme, in order to spark conversation with other participants’ (DelCarlo, 2012, p. 5). Other models of pop-up museums exist: as a temporary exhibit created by participants (Grant & Simon, 2013, p. 5), and as an ongoing organisation that produces temporary installations such as the Pop-Up Museum of Queer History based in the USA (Ryan, 2014). In Australia, DelCarlo (2011) facilitated a pop-up event at the Australian Museum; the Coffs Harbour Museum created a pop-up in the local shopping centre after flood damage to the museum (Empty Spaces, 2011); and the Mardi Gras Museum, Sydney, opened in a disused shop with the support of the city council. Although they are diverse in terms of the participation they offer to visitors, they share in common their responsive, flexible, and ephemeral orientations to objects and collections.  The Mardi Gras Museum (MGM), Sydney, was a pop-up museum that was open 29 January–3 March 2013 in a vacant shop on Oxford Street, one of the focal points of Sydney’s LGBTIQ community (Figure 15). Following the example of other urban renewal  117 programmes to offer spaces to artists, community organisations, and start-ups, the City of Sydney began offering vacant spaces along Oxford Street in 2012 (Empty Spaces, 2012). The exhibition coincided with the 35th anniversary of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (Mardi Gras) and charted its history starting with its momentous beginning in 1978 as a street parade turned riot. Curated by a committee member of ALGA, Nick Henderson, it mostly drew upon material from the Archives but also included objects such as costumes and banners. The success of the exhibit with 6,500 visitors attending led to calls to make the museum a permanent fixture on Oxford Street. The former CEO of Mardi Gras, Michael Rolik, wrote of the limitations of the temporary pop-up:  We had to leave quite a bit out of the exhibition – everyone in the community has a treasure trove of stories, and a permanent museum would let us tell those stories. We’re looking forward to working with the council to set up a dedicated space (McKinnon, 2013).   Figure 15: Ron Muncaster costume at the Mardi Gras Museum (29 January–3 March 2013), 15/02/17  There were many prominent advocates for a permanent museum including all candidates for the 2012 City of Sydney council elections (Ozturk, 2012). After the election, the council did not proceed with the plans, according to Lord Mayor Clover Moore (2014) because ‘[a] GLBTI museum should be run by the community, not politicians.’ Other councillors called  118 for an archive to be set up ‘as a precursor to the setting up of a permanent exhibition’ (Christine Forster cited in Brook, 2014). Community members also voiced their wariness towards temporary efforts. Gay artist David Urquhart commented, ‘I have 40 photos in the Mitchell Library collection which is my preferred place for my work as its future is guaranteed’ (Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, 2013). In 2016, the potential sale of the building where the museum may have opened mobilised community members to start the T2 Community Collective. Its most visible representative, activist Alastair Lawrie (2016), argued that the absence of a museum ‘denies us the opportunity to pay respect to the people who have come before, and limits the ability of younger members of the LGBTI community to learn about older generations.’ The collective launched an online petition which, as of January 2018, has garnered 822 signatures (Save the T2 Community Collective, 2016). Their calls to save the building were joined by the Darlinghurst Business Partnership—a group of small business owners located in the LGBTIQ centre of Sydney—who submitted that the council should ‘[put] something in there that is of benefit to the community’ such as a museum (Busby, 2016). The continuing calls to establish a museum indicate that communities mostly see temporary projects as inferior to sustained efforts at inclusion.  Like online museums, pop-up museums question the tenet that museum collections require permanent collections. Yet, similar to online museums, pop-ups continue to use objects to engage with visitors, thus employing the sensorial qualities of objects that play a significant role in the museum experience. The spectacular costume of Ron Muncaster dominating the centre of the space aligned with the expectation that museum exhibitions will include physical objects (Figure 15). Other pop-up museum models can involve participants bringing in their own objects, for example as part of events facilitated by the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History:  We work in collaboration with community partners to choose a theme and venue, and invite people to bring something on-topic to share. We lay out tables with empty frames and museum labels. When participants show up, they write a label for their object and leave it on display. You can think of pop up museums as potluck museums, because everyone is invited to bring something to share (Grant, 2014).   119 In addition to participants’ objects, Grant observes that exhibitions are ‘most compelling when we exhibit objects from the museums’ collection alongside’ (ibid.). Permanent collections continue to be relevant then in light of the temporary object-based practices of pop-up museums and events. Indeed, according to the History Trust of South Australia, the latter are opportunities where ‘new stories and / or objects can be collected for a proposed exhibition, or even a new museum’ (History SA, 2016a). Hence, permanent, object-based collections can be strengthened by newer museum formats even as they also interrogate existing conventions.  Objects and collections are central to popular and specialist understandings of museums, though ideas about their purpose and the boundaries surrounding objects have changed. Whether object-based, permanent collections are relevant to queer communities depends on how they are developed and interpreted. If they de-emphasise queer subjectivity in their focus on materiality, and if museums assume that they will have primary control over material culture, then museum collections will continue to have little relevance to queer communities. However, pop-up museums like the Mardi Gras Museum and online projects suggest that museum practices can be adopted strategically in order to exhibit LGBTIQ material culture. These new forms, in turn, offer different modes of engagement that museums can utilise. Rather than signalling the decreasing importance of objects and collections, they can be sources of renewal of an enduring idea.   5.7 Conclusion   Critics have taken the commitment to collections as evidence that they continue to be ‘about something’ rather than ‘being for somebody’ (Weil, 1999). Certainly, the queer invisibility in museum collections could indicate that efforts at equitable representation have been ineffective or misplaced. On this view, collections may be seen as unimportant in light of community-based heritage initiatives like the temporary Mardi Gras Museum that appropriated various museum conventions yet located control firmly within communities.  The examples discussed in this chapter have all sought to diversify museum collections. They have used the dual strategy of collecting new material (e.g. through oral histories and collection development strategies) and reinterpreting existing material through queer  120 readings and collection surveys. Where efforts have been supported by public museums, like Museum Victoria’s support of the VMS and The Gay Museum at the Western Australian Museum, exceptional results have followed. In continuing engagements between museums and queer communities lie the possibility of greater queer visibility in collections, and the preservation of queer material culture with more certainty than many short-lived community projects. To date, such collaborations are scarce and have not translated to ongoing efforts. Were public museums to take meaningful strides to replicate the forms of flexible, responsive, and collaborative practices displayed, they would go some way towards increasing the queer relevance of their collections. Exemplars already exist in both community and public museum contexts; the difficult task is to take these exceptions and turn them into new, inclusive norms. The politics around collections considered in this chapter are highly consequential to other areas of museums. In some ways, such politics are heightened when these objects are moved from storage and placed in public view. Queering exhibitions—the subject of the next chapter—is another field of contestation in the broader process of queering museums.  121 6 Queering exhibitions  Museums are not museums without exhibitions. The most prominent and public of all museum offerings, exhibitions are the soul of a museum experience for the millions of people who visit them as for many of the people who create them (McLean, 1999, p. 83).  Exhibitions are the primary way that museums interact with their audiences. It is no wonder then that the politics surrounding exhibitions are highly contested. What and who is displayed or not displayed, how something is represented, and the process that led to their production come under intense scrutiny in critiques of museum exhibitions. Queer perspectives have been added alongside postcolonial, Indigenous, feminist, and disabled critiques in the museum literature, some of which propose to use rather than reject the representational power of exhibitions. Commentary on queer exhibitions has tended to favour various characteristics over others, for instance, exhibitions hosted by public institutions over community-based exhibitions. The purpose of this chapter is twofold: first to survey and evaluate the queer exhibitions that have occurred in Australia; and second to argue that advocating for one approach (e.g. permanent over temporary exhibitions) can diminish the value that comes from contrasting approaches. Rather, with an awareness of the multiple (and often contradictory) effects of their decisions, exhibition developers may be better able to devise and implement their representational strategies.  The risks and benefits of using exhibitions to communicate LGBTIQ diversity to wider publics are considered in the first section of the chapter. Subsequently, an evaluation of the queer exhibitions that have occurred in Australia will be undertaken, looking at particular aspects including their general movement from community domains to wider publics, their physical and conceptual separation from other non-queer exhibitions, their coincidence with festivals, the prevalence of representations of HIV/AIDS, and their incorporation of internal diversity. Across these aspects, it will be shown that decisions around queering exhibitions are inherently contextual. By considering all these approaches as advantageous in different scenarios, a broader repertoire of tactics remains available to maximise the positive outcomes of museum exhibitions.  122 6.1 Exhibitions and publics  Exhibitions communicate to a public, whether inclusive of LGBTIQ diversity or not. Publics, in this conception, are plural, and their boundaries are negotiated rather than existing empirically (Warner, 2005, pp. 114–115). While the dominant (heterosexual) public has been addressed as the public, here it is viewed through its historical interest in excluding non-heterosexuality from its imaginary. The concept of publics is used in this section to explain the potential of museum exhibitions to expand the boundaries of ‘the public’ in order to include queerness. The use of exhibitions to negotiate the boundaries between public and private has a long historical precedence within museums which will be outlined. Finally, some of the potential negative effects of queer inclusion will also be considered.  The opening assertion by exhibition consultant Kathleen McLean (1999) that ‘[m]useums are not museums without exhibitions’ carries several qualifications. For one, exhibitions, particularly temporary exhibitions, have not always been as central to the function of museums. The earliest public displays can either be marked by the opening of private and aristocratic collections to the general public or the founding of the Ashmolean Museum, England, in 1683 as the first to stipulate accessibility to the public (Abt, 2006, p. 124). While there was a further dramatic increase in displays of the permanent collection in the nineteenth century, temporary exhibitions ‘become a major function and attraction of museums primarily in the 20th-century, especially in the past half-century’ (Lord, 2001, pp. 13–14).  For most of the history of museums in Australia, queer communities, and communities generally, were only included as citizens of the nation-state, not as members of their respective communities (Ramberg, 2008, p. 149). Due to the invisibility of queerness to institutions including public museums, LGBTIQ communities have conceived alternative publics supported by infrastructure such as queer community heritage organisations (QCHOs). Scholar of intimacy and belonging Lauren Berlant and social theorist Michael Warner (2005) term these alternative publics ‘queer counterpublics,’ which constitute themselves ‘in many ways other than through the official publics of opinion culture and the state or through the privatized forms normally associated with sexuality’ (p. 199). These  123 counterpublics provide safer spaces for the exploration of non-normative intimacies and identities and have historically oriented themselves inwards, forming a community.  Within the notion of queer counterpublics is the possibility of expanding beyond an inward focus towards a wider ‘queer worldmaking’ project that ‘[tries] to bring that world [where heterosexuality is not dominant] into being’ (Berlant & Warner, 2005, p. 198). Queer museologist Robert Mills (2008) writes about the expansion of queerness from the private to public domain thus:  If, in the perception of tabloids, the museum is to public as queer is to private, then one powerful way of upsetting the opposition would be to make queer desires go public (or, in Warner’s terms, ‘counterpublic’) in ways that precisely engage with the visceral resonances of gender, sexuality, and embodiment in an institutional setting (p. 47).  The efforts to further include queerness in public exhibitions are considered here to be part of a queer worldmaking project, where museums are used by queer communities to insert themselves into and thereafter change notions of ‘the public’ and ‘the people.’ As conveyed in the exhibition titles, displays like Becoming Visible, Outing Disability, and We Are Here (Figure 16) are simultaneously addressed to heterosexual audiences as well as to queer communities who are proclaiming their presence. Increasing LGBTIQ representation in exhibitions is also a result of the movement within museums to reflect the diversity of their audiences, and the recognition that ‘[m]useums have an opportunity and perhaps a responsibility to use exhibits as a tool for social awareness’ (Hancocks, 1987, p. 189). Together these trends carry the potential to integrate sex, gender, and sexual diversity as part of the overall diversity that museums are tasked with reflecting.  There are two related grounds on which the shift to wider publics has been debated: first that it might attract social and legal sanctions; and second that it may lead to assimilation and pressure to be visible. The first objection is not without warrant. There is a historical contrast between the resistance of many who participated in the post-WWII underground camp culture—surrounded by an environment of ‘[r]epression, vilification and silencing’ (Harris & Witte, 2007, p. 4)—and the increasing visibility of LGBTIQ people demanded by  124 the Gay Liberation Movement from the 1960s. Whereas ‘[i]ts members [of the camp scene] hoped for nothing more than to be left alone,’ later activists insisted queer people ‘come out’ and demanded a fundamental reform if not revolution of society (Willett, 2000, p. 9). While politically effective, disclosure also led to broken relationships, threats of violence, and loss of employment. Coming out is still a continual and potentially risky process of ‘strategic outness’ (Orne, 2011, pp. 687–688). As the curator of Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney notes, this risk is compounded by coming out to an exhibition audience: ‘Did [the visitors] even know? [that one of the participants was a lesbian] Many times they didn’t.…Agreeing to have their story there was pretty full on.…When it’s out in your community you’re taking a really huge step’ (Chalmers, 2015, interview).  The second reason for resisting greater public visibility is that assimilation or being obliged to be ‘out’ may follow. Just as individuals should have the right not to declare their sexuality or not be presumed to be heterosexual if they do not, it is held that queer communities and QCHOs have the right to disengage from public museums. For some, then, visibility is empowering whereas, for others, it relinquishes control of one’s identity. One respondent to an evaluation of an LGBTIQ museum programme asked ‘[w]here is the space for me as a bisexual with no desire whatsoever to be open about anything with my sexual orientation[?]’ (Sandell et al., 2010, p. 38). Yet, for a visitor to the exhibition Prejudice and Pride at the Museum of Brisbane, ‘[t]his exhibit gave me the courage to finally tell my mum and brother that I’m bi’ (Low, 2016, p. 234). Beyond the potential for unwanted pressure to come out, assimilation may also follow. Barrett (2011a) states in Museums and the Public Sphere that ‘[a]lternative publics do not necessarily have to remain alternative. The public sphere may be capable of adjustment (either by co-option of the alternative publics or by the public sphere being reformed by such an inclusion of alternative publics)’ (p. 137). Risk of assimilation or co-option of queer counterpublics  125 potentially follows from increased visibility33. However the next part of the chapter shows that these risks can be navigated to harness the power of exhibitions to communicate with broad audiences.  6.2 Evaluation of queer exhibitions, 1977–2016  In order to encourage critical queer inclusion in Australian exhibitions, an evaluation of those to date will be undertaken. To evaluate the queer displays that have occurred, a survey of these projects and an exploration of the multiple effects of exhibition decisions will be presented. After consideration of the selection criteria used to compile the exhibitions, five aspects of these exhibitions will be used as lenses through which to examine them, chosen because they have been subject to academic commentary in addition to relating to at least several of the exhibitions. By interrogating the critiques in light of the Australian examples, providing counter-examples, and by re-examining their supposed positive or negative effects, a more complex account of the effect of choices will be put forward.  6.2.1 Selection criteria  Relevance to queer communities, as discussed in section 5.4 ‘The Victorian Material Survey,’ is an adaptable measure that works on a spectrum from explicit LGBTIQ identification through to flexible queer readings. Relevance was also used to compile the list of exhibitions in ‘Appendix C: Queer exhibitions in Australia, 1977–2016’ from which                                                 33 Cases of co-option occur, for example, when museums and galleries choose to censor or adjust their LGBTIQ exhibitions to accommodate prejudiced beliefs. The exhibition Mad about the Boy (a title based on a song by Noël Coward) at the New Art Gallery Walsall was changed to Hidden Histories: 20th Century Male Same Sex Lovers in the Visual Arts, according to the curator, due to ‘[u]gly stereotypes about same-sex lovers being pedophiles’ (Petry, 2010). Another instance is the removal of the work ‘A Fire in My Belly’ by David Wojnarowicz—a provocative video work that can be read through the lens of his HIV/AIDS activism—from the Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, USA, in 2010 following complaints from the Catholic League (Kennicott, 2010; Kidd, 2012). Censorship and self-censorship are further discussed in section 7.2 ‘Utilising controversy.’  126 ‘Figure 16: Selected queer exhibitions in Australia, 1977–2016’ has been compiled. The selection of the exhibitions from Appendix C to Figure 16 reduces the number of exhibitions from 131 to 55, allowing for extended analysis of many of these. The following criteria and limitations had a bearing on the selection: − Queer relevance. The exhibition has been reported in queer media (e.g. Star Observer, SX – Gay News Network, Lesbians on the Loose, Joy FM) or has been the subject of academic commentary (including in queer museology, queer / LGBT studies, LGBTIQ history, and museum studies). − Impact. Related to queer relevance above in that exhibitions with greater impact have received more media and academic commentary, these exhibitions include those with higher visitation, that toured extensively, or that represent a milestone (e.g. being the first exhibition to open in a public museum). − Social history. Only exhibitions that have considerable social history dimensions have been selected, including art exhibitions that blur the lines between social history, politics, and art (e.g. section 6.2.5 ‘HIV/AIDS’ and section 5.3 ‘Queer readings’). Therefore, the analysis covers significant artist group shows as well as retrospective and survey exhibitions for major queer artists (including for Brook Andrew, Juan Davila, C. Moore Hardy, Deborah Kelly, David McDiarmid, and William Yang). − Documentation. Exhibitions with no available documentation (e.g. exhibition catalogues, ephemera, promotional material, object / artwork documentation, media, and academic commentary) could not be included. This criterion excludes many small community-based shows that are undocumented or whose documentation exists in memory or private archives (e.g. festival programming, section 6.2.4). It also tends to favour exhibitions that have opened since the 2000s, which are more readily searchable through databases and search engines (e.g. Trove, Design & Art Australia Online). However, the skewed chronology may also be a reflection of the increasing acceptance of queer-themed exhibitions in museums. − Year. Exhibitions covering the timespan from 1977 till 2016 have been selected. − Geography. Most states and territories are represented. The uneven distribution is significant and will be discussed in section 6.2.6 ‘Diversity.’ − Community-based and public. A balance of queer exhibitions from public museums and galleries as well as from community-based organisations has been selected,  127 allowing for comparisons between these domains and the study of the tensions between them. Section 6.2.2 ‘From community-based to public’ follows the general movement of queerness from community-based to public exhibitions. − Umbrella or integrated exhibition. Exhibitions that include queer material under a predominately non-queer topic are not included. When relevant, they are mentioned in the discussion, particularly in section 6.2.3 ‘Physical and conceptual separation.’   Figure 16: Selected queer exhibitions, 1977–2016. * indicates being held during a festival Year Exhibition title Organisation and location 1977 Sydneyphiles Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney (NSW) Sexual Liberation: Exhibition of Posters & Badges Adelaide University Union Gallery, Adelaide (SA) 1978 An Exhibition of Work by Homosexual and Lesbian Artists Watters Gallery, Sydney (NSW) Mistresses and Masterpieces by Dykes and Poofters Fourth Annual Homosexual Conference, Sydney (NSW) 1982 Becoming Visible: Lesbians & Male Homosexuals – From Oppression to Liberation Constitutional Museum, Adelaide (SA); Sydney Gay Centre, Surry Hills, Sydney (NSW); Liverpool Centre, Sydney (NSW) Stonewall Week Exhibition* James Harvey Gallery, Sydney (NSW) 1989 Imaging AIDS* Linden Gallery, Melbourne (VIC); Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne (VIC) 1992 Nine Artists* Barry Stern Galleries, Sydney (NSW) 1993 Australian Gay and Lesbian Culture and Recent History Drill Hall Gallery, Australian National University, Canberra (ACT) Skin: An Exhibition of Contemporary Western Australian Gay and Lesbian Art Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts (WA) 1994 Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS National Gallery of Australia, Canberra (ACT)  128 Prejudice and Pride* Australian Museum, Sydney (NSW) 1995 Robert Mapplethorpe Retrospective (WA); Mapplethorpe (NSW)* Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (NSW); Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth (WA) 1996 Absolutely Mardi Gras: Costume and Design of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras* Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, Sydney (NSW) Forbidden Love – Bold Passion: An Exhibition of Lesbian Stories 1900s–1990s [travelled till 1998] State Library of Victoria, Melbourne (VIC); Penrith Regional Gallery, Sydney (NSW); Castlemaine Historical Museum (VIC); Australian Museum, Sydney (NSW); Newcastle Museum (NSW); Albury Regional Museum (NSW); Salamanca Arts Centre (TAS); Women’s Studies Resource Centre (SA) What Happened to Baby Jane?* Lizard Lounge Artspace, Sydney (NSW) 1997 Hunter Pride: A Celebration of the Lives and Loves of the Hunter Gay, Lesbian and Transgender Community Newcastle Museum (NSW) 1998 It Was a Riot: Sydney’s First Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras* 78ers Festival, Sydney (NSW); Western Sydney University, Sydney (NSW) William Yang: Diaries: A Retrospective Exhibition, 25 Years of Social, Personal and Landscape Photography* State Library of New South Wales, Sydney (NSW)  1999 Blak Beauty* djamu Gallery, Sydney (NSW) Warrali Burrul* djamu Gallery, Sydney (NSW) 2000 Positive Lives Canberra Museum and Art Gallery (ACT) 2001 D>GEST: An Exhibition of Experimental dLux MediaArts, Adelaide (SA)  129 Screen Based Art by Nationally Recognised Gay and Lesbian Artists* Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney* Liverpool Regional Museum, Sydney (NSW) Significant Moments: Significant People, Places and Events That Have Shaped Our Community over the Last 100 Years* Midsumma Pride March, Melbourne (VIC) 2002 Just Sensational!

That is, queer exhibitions over time address wider publics in order to expand ideas of ‘the public’ (section 6.1). This section will chronologically follow key exhibitions that reflect the increasing confidence of queer communities in using public exhibitions, as well as the shift in museums towards greater inclusion. Starting with the earliest queer exhibitions mounted in Australia, the first queer exhibition that opened in a public museum (Becoming Visible: Lesbians & Male Homosexuals – From Oppression to Liberation) will be discussed, before examination of the largest exhibit to have opened at a national institution (Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS). Finally, critical reflection on the largest state-based exhibition to date, Prejudice and Pride, will show that exhibitions largely remain products of individual initiative from queer advocates rather than from total institutional commitment. It is proposed that community-based formats can co-exist with public museum exhibitions to employ their respective benefits.  1978 saw the openings of some of the earliest documented queer group exhibitions in Australia, the first being An Exhibition of Work by Homosexual and Lesbian Artists (Gray, 2014, p. 50). It is related to the second 1978 exhibition Mistresses and Masterpieces by Dykes and Poofters in that the former was fundraising for the Fourth National Homosexual Conference where the second exhibition opened. 1978 was a significant year for queer history in Australia. On 24 of June 1978, symbolically close to the anniversary of the  132 Stonewall Riots in New York City that invigorated the gay rights movements in the West, 53 people were arrested in the first Mardi Gras. The mobilisation of queer communities following the violent response of police has been dubbed ‘our Stonewall’ (Willett, 2011a). The political ferment of the Australian gay and lesbian movement, which arguably started in 1970 with the formation of the Campaign Against Moral Persecution Incorporated (or CAMP Inc.), led to the political conditions that allowed the 1978 and subsequent exhibitions to occur (Willett, 2000, p. 33). The tactic of ‘coming out’ was beginning to extend to exhibitions.  These early exhibitions are integrally tied to political movements. Indeed, their strength was their close proximity to communities, allowing them to draw upon social networks existing outside of mainstream channels and cater to ‘a special need for history. Raised as we are in heterosexual families…[w]e need to create and carry with us a living awareness of gay generations’ (D’Emilio, 2014, pp. 55–56). In addition, their informality made them inexpensive to produce and allowed them to quickly respond to changing community imperatives. The tradition is continued by the exhibitions that will be discussed in section 6.2.4 ‘Festivals.’ However, the early exhibitions opened in a private gallery and community conference space respectively because, in part, they could not open in public forums. The political conditions required for this move had not yet been attained.  Political circumstances which could allow LGBTIQ representation in a government-funded body—including new museological developments in Australian museums (section 2.2)—were met in June 1982 when the exhibition Becoming Visible: Lesbians & Male Homosexuals – From Oppression to Liberation opened at the Constitutional Museum, Adelaide (Figure 17). The exhibition is probably the first queer exhibition that was opened with the support of a public museum in Australia and, indeed, precedes similar exhibitions in the USA and UK (Anderson, 2011, p. 4).34 It was also opened in the first community gallery in Australia—a space where communities can display exhibitions with minimal intervention by the museum—allowing it to represent marginal voices. Nevertheless, the                                                 34  Becoming Visible at the Migration Museum, Adelaide, predates the first major LGBTIQ exhibitions at public institutions in the USA and UK: Becoming Visible: The Legacy of Stonewall at the New York Public Library in 1994 (Lehner, 2008, p. 6), and Pride and Prejudice: Lesbian and Gay London at the Museum of London in 1999 (Hayward, 2015, p. 97).  133 museum encountered fierce criticism from the Christian organisation Australian Festival of Light (now FamilyVoice Australia) for breaking the de facto silence around sexuality (section 7.2: Utilising controversy). The Gay Display Collective who produced the content for the exhibition was the first queer community group to engage with the processes of a public museum towards its own ends, opening itself to another field of contestation. It also marks the first time that the desire for increasing public representation by queer communities meets with the acknowledgement by a public museum that such material is worthy of inclusion.   Figure 17: Becoming Visible at the Constitutional Museum in June 1982. Image courtesy of the History Trust of South Australia  The inclusive approach to museum practice seen at the Constitutional Museum demonstrates the influence of political change within museums and South Australian society from the 1970s. In museums, social histories began to be incorporated into Australian museums during the period (Gore, 2001, p. 47) and the ethics behind pronouncements that museums should become a ‘forum…where the battles’ are fought rather than ‘where the victors rest’ were increasingly articulated (Cameron, 1971, p. 21). Across Australia, LGBTIQ political movements from the 1970s became more confident in using the cultural sphere as a battleground. Moreover, in South Australia, it was assisted by the progressive state politics of the ‘Dunstan Decade’ (1970–1979) that promoted the arts  134 and social justice (Hodge, 2014, p. 311).35 In this climate, museums were being compelled from within and outside to expand their boundaries of inclusion.  The early 1980s to the mid-1990s saw queer communities further propelled to public scrutiny as HIV/AIDS became viewed as a ‘gay disease’ (section 6.2.5). In the cultural sphere, public visibility peaked with the exhibition Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS that opened at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) (12 November 1994–5 March 1995) (Figure 18), a major change of scale from the small gallery which Becoming Visible occupied 12 years earlier. As the first exhibition in the world on HIV/AIDS at a national institution, its importance in signalling this shift cannot be overstated. It included works from over 100 artists from Australia, the UK, the USA, and France who responded to the AIDS Crisis that disproportionately affected gay men (Aids-Art, 2013). Through the incorporation of paintings, installations, costumes, sculptures, and graphics it explored themes including the indiscriminate spread of AIDS, images of AIDS in popular culture, gay culture, prejudice and stereotypes, censorship, grief, and commemoration (Dreishpoon, 1995, p. 90).                                                  35 Don Dunstan was the Premier of South Australia from 1970–1979, a period that has become known as the Dunstan Decade. As leader of the Labor Party, he brought about the first successful bill to decriminalise male homosexuality in Australia, recognised Aboriginal land rights, and invested extensively in the arts. His ambiguous sexuality caused speculation at the time, with gay historian Dino Hodge (2014) assembling evidence of the ‘bisexual polyamory of his personal life’ (p. 312).  135  Figure 18: Don’t Leave Me This Way (12 November 1994–5 March 1995). Image courtesy of the National Gallery of Australia (1995, p. 31)  Although the NGA was expecting 10,000 visitors, it instead received 140,000 including children and school groups over four months (Bunyan, 2014). The political message and art of Don’t Leave Me This Way reached a broad audience: with seven out of ten visitors being under 40 and a quarter under 25 years old, the gallery achieved a demographic profile that had not been met in over a decade; moreover, while only six in ten visitors came specifically to see the exhibition, 94% of visitors to the gallery attended the exhibition (Market Attitude Research Services, 1994). The evaluation report cited two typical comments on the survey question as being ‘[t]he exhibition shows a positive representation of people with HIV/AIDS vs the negative mainstream media reporting’ and ‘[t]he exhibition is showing responsibility, health, open mindness [sic] and that AIDS can be caught by anyone’ (p. 15). Also attesting to the emotional impact of the exhibition, it was the first time that security staff encountered open weeping in the gallery, requiring tissues and armchairs to be provided at the centre of the show (Stephens, 2014). Unlike the first public queer exhibition in 1982, no significant resistance was encountered (Harper, 2004, p. 66). Perhaps it was due to the aesthetic framework of the exhibition or, as has been suggested, because temporary exhibitions are able to incorporate controversial material in ways that permanent displays cannot (Macdonald, 2010, p. 201). The absence of controversy, especially at a national public institution, was probably unforeseeable for  136 exhibition developers in the 1970s and 80s. It showed that LGBTIQ diversity had become more acceptable in public museum and gallery spaces  Since Don’t Leave Me This Way, many exhibitions have occurred in public museums, though not to the same scale at a national institution. Indeed, the few examples of inclusion at the national level include LGBTIQ badges and political posters at the Museum of Australian Democracy; Mardi Gras costumes at the National Museum of Australia; portraits of LGBTIQ-identified individuals at the National Portrait Gallery; and oral histories and images of defence force personnel who have marched in the Mardi Gras at the Australian War Memorial (Gwyn, 2013). As of 2017, no national temporary LGBTIQ exhibition had been mounted since the gay-identified curator Ted Gott curated Don’t Leave Me This Way. It suggests again that queer-identified advocates and amenable political and financial situations are central to exhibitions occurring. The position is further supported by the exhibition Prejudice and Pride: Recognising the Contribution of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Communities to Brisbane that opened at the Museum of Brisbane in 2010, which shows that while there is occasional public representation of queerness in public museum exhibitions, it remains an exception.  Prejudice and Pride remains the largest queer social history exhibition that has been undertaken in Australia (4 June–17 October 2010) (Figure 19). The lead-up to the exhibition began when the Queensland Association for Healthy Communities (formerly the Queensland AIDS Council) successfully applied for a heritage grant, allowing it to appoint the curator Carol Low part-time for a year to engage with LGBTIQ communities to gather their histories. The Museum of Brisbane programmed the exhibition for the following year, and the State Library of Queensland also became partners in the project. To gather the historical material required for the exhibition apart from the major publication Sunshine and Rainbows: The Development of Gay and Lesbian Culture in Queensland (Moore, 2001), 20 oral histories were conducted and subsequently lodged at the State Library, the historians Yorick Smaal and Shirleene Robinson were commissioned to produce exhibition text for the history panels, and outreach was undertaken with the community to gather objects and archival material. In all, 300 people participated in the development of the exhibition (Moore, 2011, p. 253). The exhibition also won the 2010 Gallery & Museum Achievement Award from the peak professional museum body in Queensland and was  137 called by the historian Graham Willett (2011b) ‘perhaps the finest of such exhibitions to date’ (p. 10).   Figure 19: Visitors at Prejudice and Pride: Recognising the Contribution of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Communities to Brisbane (4 June–17 October 2010). Image courtesy of the Museum of Brisbane  The exhibition represented three themes of ‘identity,’ ‘spaces and places,’ and ‘codes’ (i.e. codes of recognition) via more than 30 text panels, 8 video screens, over 300 objects, ephemera, and archival images. The 10 history panels covered the span of Queensland LGBTIQ history from pre-colonial times till the present. Topics covered included ‘romantic friendships’ between women in the nineteenth century, ‘passing women,’ the emergence of the underground subculture that intensified after WWII, the push for homosexual law reform, gay liberation, HIV/AIDS, and the emergence today of a ‘fully fledged culture,’ all evidenced with examples and personal accounts from Queensland (Museum of Brisbane, 2010a). The theme ‘spaces and places’ included sites of politics, socialising, sexual encounters, spirituality, sport, pride festivals, scholarship, and entertainment (ibid.).  As a partnership between the QAHC, the State Library, and the Museum of Brisbane, the process and outcome of the exhibition were effective ways of increasing queer visibility for the general public while maintaining a connection with the communities to whom the exhibition was most closely linked. However, without members of queer communities  138 within these organisations, the exhibition would probably not have occurred. While there were key non-queer advocates within the public institutions, according to the curator who identifies as a lesbian, support for the exhibition came from ‘well-positioned people [and] I might add, a lesbian in the State Library’ (Low, 2015, interview). She also reflects that the political conditions at the time and place were just right for the intervention:  It was just a point in history where that was all able to take place and…you couldn’t do it again. Those people were in those positions, [another curator at the Museum of Brisbane who identifies as a lesbian] then went from the Museum to the State Library so brought them in as a partner, David Hinchliffe [an openly gay former councillor] still happened to be Deputy Lord Mayor—it was just that time when that could happen (ibid.).  While Prejudice and Pride is one of the few large LGBTIQ social history exhibitions yet opened in a public museum, it has taken the efforts of queer individuals and communities in a position to attract political backing and financial funding to lead the development. There is therefore continuity with the situation in the 1970s when public institutions did not acknowledge sex, gender, and sexual diversity in their displays: today, it is still only occasionally represented. Collaborations between queer organisations and public institutions are foundational to museums orienting themselves towards communities. However, the exhibitions surveyed indicate that such programming usually occurs when the organisation has a record of inclusive practice, demonstrates attention to social history, and if there are queer people inside organisations to lead them (section 4.4). For Prejudice and Pride, prior collections like the State Library’s oral history and digital story collection also made it more amenable to participating in the project (Klaebe & Burgess, 2010). On the whole, it suggests that the discourse of diversity and inclusion within cultural institutions often fails to consider LGBTIQ identities, requiring those whose intentions are simultaneously personal, political, and professional to intervene.  Nevertheless, the exhibition set a new attendance benchmark, indicating that many non-queer visitors are able to appreciate LGBTIQ history and culture (Low, 2016, p. 223). Exhibitions at public museums can be powerful communicative tools for society (in the broadest sense) to examine itself and its constitutive diversity. Integration into broader  139 society is one of the effects of moving queerness from the community domain to the broader public sphere, but does not mean that community exhibitions are a less valuable, interim step. The display of queerness within communities remains crucial given that exhibitions are part of the cultural infrastructure that reproduces those communities; without the cross-generational sharing available to non-queer families, ‘[t]here will always be a need for those of a dissident sexuality to find a place where there are “others like themselves”’ (Wotherspoon, 2016, p. 316). Hence, QCHOs like the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, which supports the most sustained exhibition programme in Australia, remain important even given increasing tolerance of queer visibility (section 6.2.3). Museums do not set standards against which exhibitions at other sites should be compared. Rather, exhibitions in community-based and public contexts offer unique qualities that can be part of an effective strategy to increase LGBTIQ public visibility and acceptance. Emphasising both / and over either / or that is undertaken in this chapter is intended to pull away from the arguable tendency in museum studies ‘to duality…rather than thinking about complex and multi-layered relationships’ (MacLeod, 2001, p. 60).  6.2.3 Physical and conceptual separation  Ghettoisation and separatism of diverse groups from wider society have been challenged from both nationalist and minority perspectives. There has been constant opposition to the official policy of multiculturalism, since the mid-1970s when it was introduced, on the supposed grounds that it leads to ethnic and cultural ‘ghettos’ (Jupp, 2010, p. 108). Conservative historian Geoffrey Blainey (1991), for example, rebuked the notion of white arrival being a ‘story of violence, exploitation, [and] repression’ and became a prominent critic of multiculturalism (p. 19). He accused Prime Minister Bob Hawke (1983–1991) of ‘turning Australia into a nation of tribes’ by ‘shunning the national pride of the great majority’ and, consequently, undermining the strength and security of the nation (Blainey, 1988, p. 42). From the other view, those who embody minority differences have questioned the utility of focusing on those differences. There are continual debates on whether applying labels such as ‘women’s’ or ‘disabled’ to art—to take just two versions—is empowering or ‘ghettoising’ (Bartlett & Henderson, 2016, p. 135; Cachia, 2013, p. 258). The above conversation has been repeated in museum studies where physically and conceptually separate exhibitions have been criticised. While acknowledging the value of  140 ‘umbrella’ exhibitions that integrate queer and non-queer themes, it will be argued that community-focussed exhibitions are often able to critically navigate these issues.  The most developed argument critiquing the spatial and conceptual separation of queer exhibitions comes from museum studies scholar Maria-Anna Tseliou. As a result of her research in the UK for her doctoral thesis Museums and Heteronormativity: Exploring the Effects of Inclusive Interpretive Strategies (2013b), she writes:  For the most part, projects are relatively short term (on display for a few weeks or months), marked by spatial separation from other exhibits (usually contained in a gallery set apart from the rest of the museum and the permanent displays of collections), and appear to be primarily aimed at audiences—identifying themselves as LGBTQ or LGBTQ friendly [conceptual separation] (Tseliou, 2013a, pp. 4–5).  The critique implicates temporary exhibitions whose content, it is argued, is targeted at a narrowly defined audience. It does not take into account exhibitions at smaller museums and galleries where the queer exhibitions may take up the entire gallery (e.g. Hung Drawn & Quartered at the Tin Sheds Gallery, Sydney, and Vital Signs – Interpreting the Archives at the Blindside Gallery, Melbourne). Nevertheless, there is evidence supporting the same critique among the Australian displays. For instance, Becoming Visible was developed by outsourcing to an external community group rather than developing the exhibition in-house. In addition, many exhibitions that opened in public museums included signs restricting access to adults or recommending adult guidance (e.g. Prejudice and Pride at the Australian Museum), which resulted in ‘setting up relationships between unmarked sexual “normalcy” and marked sexual “perversity”’ (Tyburczy, 2009, p. 22). However, a foregrounding of alternative effects of separation complicates Tseliou’s argument.  Becoming Visible: Lesbians & Male Homosexuals – From Oppression to Liberation, as well as being the first exhibition opened with the support of a public museum in Australia, was also held in the first community gallery in Australia, the Speakers’ Corner within the Constitutional Museum, Adelaide. Community galleries are not only exhibition spaces but also a process of developing exhibitions. They allow for community groups to propose and develop exhibitions using resources (e.g. display space, curatorial expertise, marketing, and  141 collections) of the museum with minimal staff intervention. As they typically are located in separate galleries and focus on a particular community group, exhibitions opened in these spaces are subject to Tseliou’s critique of the recurrent physical and conceptual separation of queer exhibitions. Reflecting on community galleries in Australia, O’Reilly and Parish (2015) write:  Community displays tend to have an inward focus.…Hosted in a museum, these exhibitions can have an inherent exclusivity as they may be speaking to their own community, rather than the broad public that a museum needs to attract. Thus, audiences can be comparatively limited, and both self-selecting and self-serving, which seems counter-intuitive to ideas of increasing access (p. 305).  This matches Tseliou’s critique precisely. Instead, she suggests that museums should integrate sexual difference through the ‘insertion of LGBTIQ topics under “umbrella themes”’ (Tseliou, 2013c). Concepts like family and non-sexual forms of belonging allow connections to be formed between queer and non-queer groups (e.g. We Are Family that opened at the Australian Centre for Photography in 2014, Got the Message? 50 Years of Political Posters at the Art Gallery of Ballarat in 2014, and the permanent exhibition The Power of Change at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery [Figure 20]). The ability of umbrella exhibitions to successfully integrate LGBTIQ diversity has led to the proposition that ‘[i]f museums are to become spaces in which queer visibility is prioritized, the most successful approach may be a focus on sameness’ (Karkruff, 2014, p. 18).   142  Figure 20: LGBTIQ and ally banners displayed prominently in the permanent exhibition The Power of Change at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, 20/05/14  While community gallery exhibitions have the potential to be inward looking, Becoming Visible was not. It included much material challenging myths about homosexuality which was directed at straight and non-straight visitors: the display text aimed at heterosexuals and ‘closeted’ individuals stated ‘[w]e want you to have a glimpse of our history, our pride, our struggles, and ourselves;’ and for LGBTIQ visitors, the accompanying leaflet included an index of social, legal, and religious services for support (History Trust of South Australia, 1982). The exhibition caused controversy because it reached out beyond the boundaries of community by addressing non-LGBTIQ audiences. One complaint letter read, ‘I would like to register my disgust at our museum being used to promote this deluded, sick practice’; another anonymous caller describing himself as a counsellor protested, ‘I work with homosexual hang-ups and I realise they can’t help it but I’m tired of them flaunting their problem’ (History Trust of South Australia, 1982; emphasis in original). From the late 1970s, queer counterpublics moved their gaze outward to work with public institutions on their own terms. Mounting Becoming Visible expressed the newfound confidence to engage in often-heated debate, as well as an interest in the opportunities offered by museums to communicate to a broader public. Thus, it also fulfilled the aim of  143 the gallery to be a ‘speakers’ corner,’ historically a public space for free discussion.36 Between 1980 and 1995 when the Constitutional Museum was open, other controversial issues explored included class struggle, nuclear power, immigration, animal liberation, animal experimentation, and Indigenous self-determination (History Trust of South Australia, 1992). It indicates that physical and conceptual separation can be the basis for broader social and political engagement.  Audience statistics from another exhibition, Prejudice and Pride that opened at the Australian Museum in 1994 (different from the one of the same name at the Museum of Brisbane), also convey that queer exhibitions have a broader appeal and impact than Tseliou’s critique of separation implies. While the exhibition was produced under the Rapid Response Program as a subsidiary to the main exhibitions and further focused on a queer subject (the Mardi Gras), 50% of visitors did not come to the museum specifically to see it (Kelly, 1994); probably most of these visitors were therefore straight-identified. Physical and conceptual separation, therefore, did not result in only LGBTIQ people viewing the display.  Community gallery exhibitions, those produced under special programmes, temporary exhibitions, and those displayed in peripheral locations all emerge from the critique of separation with caveats to their supposed limitations. It was established previously (section 6.2.2) that community-based exhibitions have their own strengths, and that argument applies here as well. Rather than only considering ‘umbrella’ or ‘integrated’ modes of exhibiting, a more complex account that recognises the enabling characteristics of physically and conceptually separate exhibitions becomes available. Best practice in balancing the enabling and limiting elements among queer Australian exhibitions is often displayed by community-based organisations, unsettling the suggestion that community groups produce inward looking and perhaps less critical exhibitions. For instance, ALGA (2016b), as well as maintaining the most sustained queer exhibition programme in the country (Vital Signs – Interpreting the Archives, Gay Times Are Here Again, and Mardi Gras Museum) has contributed material to thematic exhibitions including Got the Message?                                                 36 The Speakers’ Corner originated in Hyde Park, London, in the mid-1800s and inspired similar areas in Sydney in 1878 and Melbourne in the late 1800s (Heritage Council Victoria, 2017; Maxwell, 2017).  144 50 Years of Political Posters, Bohemian Melbourne, and Memories of the Struggle – Australians Against Apartheid. According to its former president Graham Willett (2012), ALGA ‘provides a means to raise the profile of a small and marginalised part of the national story and integrate it into that bigger story’ (n.p.).  The above exhibitions that were produced by queer communities about queer subjects show a consciousness about the issue of separation. Far from being unconcerned with communicating to wider heterosexual publics, engagements with public museums since the late 1970s were predicated upon the cultural and political goals of queer communities. Physically and conceptually separate queer exhibitions—as opposed to umbrella, integrated, or thematic exhibitions—do not necessarily lead to uncritical and insular representations, but have strategic value alongside more broadly themed exhibitions. As Fraser & Heimlich (2008a) argue, ‘[t]he ghettoizing of the queer story is not without its benefit, because a community needs a place to incubate their story’ (p. 11). Not foreclosing any of these approaches broadens the repertoire of exhibitionary strategies.  6.2.4 Festivals  Festivals are regular events based on a common interest (e.g. music) or affiliation (e.g. ethnic festivals), ‘creat[ing] and encourage[ing] a sense of social cohesion in culturally diverse everyday social worlds’ (Duffy & Waitt, 2011, p. 47). In the case of queer festivals, they are often founded on shared personal and political bonds. In focusing on communities, as discussed in the previous section, they have been said to foster separatism. After confirming the great extent of the timing of exhibitions with queer festivals in Australia, the benefits of the concurrence will then be highlighted by looking in more detail at the programming of the Brisbane Powerhouse. In their connection to communities and in requiring a relatively modest level of commitment from cultural organisations, programming during queer festivals, it will be shown, is an important strategy for public representations of queerness.  Queer festivals exist in every state and territory in Australia: Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (New South Wales, established 1978); Darwin Pride Festival (Northern Territory, established 1985); Midsumma Festival (Victoria, established 1989); Pride  145 Western Australia (established 1989); Brisbane Pride Festival (Queensland, established 1990); TasPride (Tasmania, established 1992); Feast Festival (South Australia, established 1997); and SpringOut Pride Festival (Australian Capital Territory, established 1999). Although much less common than exhibitions in metropolitan centres, exhibitions like 25 Years of Inclusion: The Tropical Fruits Inc. A GLBTI Social His/Her/Our/Story have opened during regional festivals, in this case the Tropical Fruits New Year’s Festival (Lismore, established 1988). Festivals generally ‘are mechanisms that can help constitute individual feelings of acceptance and belonging within an imagined, collective sense of “we,” or being part of the community’ (Duffy & Waitt, 2011, p. 55). Similarly, queer festivals contribute significantly to sustaining queer communities, arts, and cultures, which any criticism of festival programming must take into account.  Surveying the queer exhibitions in Figure 16 reveals the great degree to which festivals have become focal points for queer programming in community-based and public contexts. Taking the last ten years (2006–2016), 18 of 22 exhibitions were included in the official programmes of queer festivals. Of the exhibitions that did not coincide with a festival, We Are Here: Riverina LGBTIQ Stories opened in a region not large enough to sustain a queer festival. In addition, the retrospective exhibition of gay Chilean-Australian artist Juan Davila and the survey exhibition Brook Andrew: Eye to Eye did not open during festivals possibly due to wariness of LGBTIQ artists towards being compartmentalised by their identities, Brook Andrew stating, ‘when I first started making art, people would label me as “the gay black artist.” And I’d think, “Uh-uh…I’m an artist”’ (Message Stick, 2004). Beyond the exhibitions that were selected for Figure 16, hundreds of exhibitions have opened during queer festivals since they were established. In 1995 alone, 15 gay and lesbian exhibitions opened during the Mardi Gras (Ashburn, 1996, p. 25).  Other exhibitions from 2006–2016 were timed to be concurrent with conferences, for example, David McDiarmid: When This You See Remember Me that opened during the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne (9 May–31 August 2014). McDiarmid made many political artworks dealing with HIV/AIDS and therefore the timing of the exhibition was arguably a better fit than the Midsumma Festival. Conferences often have their own cultural programmes as was the case with the early queer group exhibitions: Sexual Liberation: Exhibition of Posters & Badges during the Third National Homosexual  146 Conference in 1977, and An Exhibition of Work by Homosexual and Lesbian Artists and Mistresses and Masterpieces by Dykes and Poofters during the Fourth National Homosexual Conference in 1978. Like queer festivals, such conferences are deeply connected with LGBTIQ communities and can similarly combine cultural and political expression.  The near universal timing of queer exhibitions with festivals has been subject to critique in museum studies literature. Winchester (2012) is representative of this evaluation:  Events [e.g. coinciding with LGBT History Month in the UK] may be high profile, thoroughly curated and thought provoking, engaging their audiences in subjects that may be familiar or alien, yet in general they cannot be said to have a legacy or weight comparable to permanent displays or major headline exhibitions (p. 144).  The critique resonates in the Australian context where very few of the exhibitions in Figure 16 were subsequently integrated into permanent exhibitions. In addition, few were developed either using the permanent collections of museums or used materials that were subsequently acquired for later exhibitions. Even the ‘major headline exhibitions’ that Winchester advocates for, like Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS, lessened their long-term impact in not acquiring more material: ‘Normally, the expectation would be that an institution like the NGA would make a substantial purchasing commitment but it didn’t happen in this case.…[M]any important opportunities were lost’ (Swieca et al., 1999, p. 7). Indeed, the majority of works were returned to their loan collections except for a considerable number of Australian posters gifted by AIDS councils and activist groups.37 Hunter Pride: A Celebration of the Lives and Loves of the Hunter Gay, Lesbian and                                                 37 Works acquired or gifted as a result of the exhibition include: Godscience V and Godscience VI (eX de Medici, 1994); Homosapien (Brenton Heath-Kerr, 1994); multiple prints of the Rainbow Aphorism series (David McDiarmid, 1994), Untitled XIII (Ejaculate in Trajectory) (Andres Serrano, 1989), Bloodstream (Andres Serrano, 1987), Monument for Them (Marilyn Tabatznik, 1992), AIDS Virus on White Blood Cell / Grey (Virus) Border (Carl Tandatnick, 1993), Untitled #1 (Ross Watson, 1993), Untitled (for ACT UP) (David Wojnarowicz, 1990), Vigil (William Yang, 1994), dozens of posters from ACT UP groups in Australia and internationally, and dozens of posters from the AIDS councils of the ACT, NSW, and VIC.  147 Transgender Community (25 July–6 September 1997) represents one occasion where queer exhibition content was integrated into permanent exhibits: a t-shirt from the Gay and Lesbian Information Service was included in the exhibition A Newcastle Story (Figure 21), and an early gay bar The Capana established in the 1970s is featured in the exhibit Beaumont Street. While few temporary exhibition items are integrated into permanent displays, this does not diminish the case for temporary queer festivals as a case study of the Brisbane Powerhouse and its annual queer festival programming will demonstrate.    Figure 21: LGBTIQ items in the permanent exhibition A Newcastle Story at the Newcastle Museum, 13/06/15  The Brisbane Powerhouse opened in 2000, adaptively reusing Brisbane’s first power station. While the queer history of the site feasibly extends to its use as a beat—a public place to look for casual, anonymous sex—the first queer programming as a multidisciplinary arts organisation occurred in its inaugural year. The Brisbane Queer Film Festival was the first festival that the Powerhouse initiated and has run every year since. The organisation also began the festival ‘MELT: A Celebration of Queer Arts and Culture’ in 2015 (5–15 February) featuring a performance and visual arts programme. The critique that queer programming is mainly temporary connects with both of these festivals. However, it can be complicated through two points concerning the concentration of programming around festivals: first that they often result in stronger programming on a  148 number of levels, and second that the impact of festivals is greater if they are not viewed in isolation but, rather, as a series of regular interventions across Australia throughout the year.  Queer festivals arguably result in stronger programmes financially, culturally, and artistically. This is suggested by the producer and former MELT Festival director Adam Gardnir (2016, interview) who said that ‘we can almost fund the queer arts better if they’re in a nice, strong festival rather than what was previously the case which is pattering it out across the year and each seek individual funding which was quite random in how that worked.’ In strategically positioning MELT between Midsumma (January–February) and Mardi Gras (February–March), Gardnir argues that a network of festivals can attract queer programming to Australia: ‘I’d like us to have that strength of an offer that leading artists think “it would be too difficult to go to Australia just for Sydney but we can go for Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne.” One of my initiatives is to get the three of us so strong that we are drawing key artists and advocates to the three of us’ (ibid.). As well as concentrating programming that would otherwise occur as one-off events throughout the year, festivals allow for profitable events to subsidise socially valuable events that lose money, offer increased opportunities for targeted sponsorship and funding, use of a pre-existing network to gather support, and the building of a profile independent of separate organisations. Above all, queer festivals are central to the maintenance of queer communities and the production of queer exhibitions.  The second argument that can complicate the critique of festivals is that their impact is greater if they are not taken in isolation but rather as existing in a network of other festivals. The MELT Festival complements events run by the community-based organisation Brisbane Pride, including a fair day and pride march, in being spaced six months apart. It effectively doubles the impact of large-scale queer festivals in the region, allows for the pursuit of different audience profiles, and results in regular, high profile events. Of course, most cities cannot sustain more than one queer festival in a year. However, including festivals beyond Brisbane and Queensland expands the number of queer interventions to take into account. Queer festivals in other states and territories become destinations for LGBTIQ travellers for cultural tourism and to confirm their sense of identity (Markwell & Waitt, 2009, p. 154). However, it brings issues of access to the fore as many LGBTIQ  149 people cannot afford full participation in their local queer festivals, let alone those further afield (Markwell, 2002, p. 84). At the very least, there remains the potential of the pastiche of queer festivals to foster ‘imagined communities’ through queer media (e.g. Star Observer, SX – Gay News Network, Lesbians on the Loose, and Joy FM) (Anderson, 1983).  Moreover, interaction between queer festivals can be extended to other public displays of queerness, not limited to community-based and public galleries, libraries, and archives. While McWilliam (2007) looks at the Brisbane Queer Film Festival (BQFF) hosted by the Brisbane Powerhouse, her argument is applicable to the MELT Festival and queer festivals in general:  [T]he BQFF becomes one site among many within a queer counter-public sphere, operating alongside queer newspapers, cafes, sex clubs, and the like....By reading it as one part of the city’s and state’s queer whole, it also becomes less significant that the BQFF is ultimately a short, annual event, because there are, quite simply, other spaces and moments in which to contribute to a collective articulation and enactment of queerness in Brisbane and Queensland (p. 88).  Queer festivals exist then alongside ‘queer newspapers, cafes, sex clubs’ and other queer counterpublic spaces. The collective impact of the mediums, as for festivals, is far greater than if viewed in isolation. Taken together, these interventions help sustain and reproduce queer communities. Queer festivals have been opportunities for exhibitions to occur which otherwise would not, and have proven to be convincing arguments for public museums to develop queer programming. They therefore remain essential resources for public representations of queerness.  6.2.5 HIV/AIDS  The enormous loss and grief caused by the AIDS Crisis starting in Australia in the 1980s impacts all subsequent queer exhibitions in a number of ways. HIV/AIDS thereafter becomes the explicit subject of many exhibitions, a theme explored alongside others, or forms part of the history of queer communities that must be understood as ‘it shapes the contours of the discourses, actions, and memories that mark the decade’ (Mazaris, 2010, p.  150 88). After a brief outline of HIV/AIDS in Australia, the critique that the prominence of this subject denies attention to other subjects will be evaluated.  AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is caused by infection with HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus) through sexual, intravenous, or mother-to-child transmission; health complications and possible death occur as a result of suppressed immune responses to common infections. While the syndrome was first observed clinically in 1981 in the USA, the first diagnosed case of AIDS in Australia occurred in November 1982 (Bowtell, 2005, p. 5). From the first diagnosis till 2013, 35,287 cases of HIV have been reported, 9,900–10,000 having died of AIDS-related causes (Kirby Institute, 2014, p. 1). Most deaths occurred in the 80s and 90s due to the lack of effective combination antiretroviral therapy. While in Australia people now generally live with HIV as a manageable, long-term condition, the AIDS epidemic continues where knowledge of safe sex and needle usage, as well as access to antiretroviral medication and contraceptives, is inadequate. In 2013, 35 million people were living with AIDS (24.7 million in sub-Saharan Africa alone) with only 12.9 million of these people (37%) having access to antiretroviral therapy (UNAIDS, 2014, pp. 1–2).   There remains a persistent association of HIV/AIDS with being a ‘gay’ disease. Even in clinical settings, the syndrome was called the Gay Related Immune Deficiency before the term AIDS was established. While it is the case in Australia that 70% of HIV transmission occurs between men who have sex with men (many of whom identify as gay or bisexual), globally, heterosexual transmission is dominant (Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, 2015; Cock, Jaffe, & Curran, 2012, p. 1210). Part of the fear of AIDS stemmed from discriminatory attitudes towards groups that became associated with the disease: ‘AIDS achieved rapid infamy through its association with a set of social and sexual practices considered by many to be deviant and highly immoral: homosexuality, illicit drug use and prostitution’ (Power, 2011, p. 1). The interrelated stigma of AIDS and gay communities continues to make health service delivery and education more difficult. It is in the cultural arena including museum exhibitions that some notable interventions have occurred to shape public thoughts and feelings towards HIV/AIDS.   151 The first recorded death in Australia from AIDS-related illnesses occurred in July 1984, less than two years after the first diagnosis. Soon after, the first memorialisation projects began as the deaths started to mount: the first Australian candlelight memorial was held in 1985 in Melbourne, the Australian AIDS Memorial Quilt Project began in 1988, and the first HIV/AIDS exhibition occurred in 1989. Imaging AIDS opened simultaneously at the Linden Gallery (18 January–5 February) and the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (28 January–26 February), Melbourne, and is cited as Australia’s first art exhibition on AIDS (Stone, 1989, p. 4). It was initially planned as an auction to raise money for those living with AIDS, but the curators decided that ‘instead of just raising money we could also educate people, make them aware of what it’s all about’ (ibid.). From their beginning, all exhibitions that have covered HIV/AIDS—including Don’t Leave Me This Way, Bodies Positive, Positive Lives, With and Without You, HIV and AIDS—have not only sought to ‘[record] the impact of the epidemic…[but] have an immediate effect on how it is perceived and regulated’ (Altman, 1994, p. 167).  The arguably world-leading response to HIV/AIDS in Australia relied on the coalition of governments at all levels, medical researchers and organisations, and, importantly, the involvement of the communities that were most affected by the disease (Robinson, 2014). The nationally coordinated interventions that resulted, including public education initiatives and needle and syringe programmes, were supported by arts and cultural projects that aimed to increase HIV/AIDS awareness. Towards this end, the then Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health provided $250,000 towards the exhibition Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS (Sendziuk, 2003, p. 206). Public museums and galleries also lent their support by mounting exhibitions: 7 out of the 55 selected exhibitions are primarily about HIV/AIDS, all opening within public museums and galleries.   While the representation of HIV/AIDS in exhibitions continues to have an important role in educating the public about the shifting nature of the disease towards long-term management, and while the unabated affliction continues overseas, the effects of the ‘epidemic of signification’ of HIV/AIDS has been critically examined in museum studies (Treichler, 1987). Many representations of queer communities in exhibitions have been limited to coverage of HIV/AIDS, highly visible elements like pride celebrations and drag  152 performances, and have often centred on famous figures or ‘queeroes’ (Hayward, 2015, p. 109). The exhibition 80s Are Back at the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (2010), for example, included the gay and lesbian community through coverage of the AIDS Crisis and Mardi Gras. On the one hand, any inclusion of queerness in exhibitions remains an exception rather than the norm. On the other, representations of queerness have been limited to a few highly visible subjects. Focusing and reinforcing certain aspects of queerness is another form of ‘conceptual separation’ discussed in the chapter.  The abundance of representations of HIV/AIDS may support queer museologist Anna Conlan’s (2010) claim that ‘[t]he persistent association of homosexuality with death and oppression contributes to a negative stereotype of LGBTQ lives as unhappy and unhealthy’ (p. 259). Vanegas (2002) adds that the ‘danger occurs if this is the only place in such institutions that gay men are represented’ (p. 104). While early HIV/AIDS exhibitions were important in raising awareness and basic education around the disease, its persistent alignment with queerness—gay men in particular—has had problematic effects, leading political philosopher Tomasz Kitlinski and curator Paweł Leszkowicz (2013) to reflect that ‘since queerness in a homophobic society…is already identified with taboo, revulsion, and death, there is no need to confirm this through any creative, activist, academic, or artistic work’ (p. 182). According to their line of reasoning, while HIV/AIDS exhibitions in the 1990s served an important purpose in responding to the AIDS epidemic, they have become unnecessary or less necessary today.  Although acknowledging the reservations above that the emphasis on HIV/AIDS potentially limits the range of topics under which queerness can be discussed, it is maintained that it remains relevant and important. There are 27,150 people living with HIV across the country. In addition, over a thousand people continue to be diagnosed with HIV in Australia every year and new strategies like pre-exposure prophylaxis continue to emerge, showing that the educative potential of exhibitions is still required (Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, 2015). Furthermore, the exhibitions that cover HIV/AIDS have generally done so inclusively and critically, acknowledging its impact on haemophiliacs, sex workers, and intravenous drug users. The exhibition Access to Life at the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (2013a) opened alongside HIV and AIDS: 30 Years On: The Australian Story in order to show the current global, predominately  153 heterosexual, impact of the epidemic. And works from the late artist David McDiarmid that reclaim the sexuality of HIV-positive men continue to be used for safe sex campaigns and were recently exhibited in David McDiarmid: When This You See Remember Me (Gray, 2014). Such works and exhibitions show that art, politics, emotion, and the capacity for social change still continue to be embodied in displays on HIV/AIDS. In seeking more diverse representations what is required is more queer inclusion in exhibitions generally rather than fewer exhibitions on HIV/AIDS.  6.2.6 Diversity  In the final section, the diversity of the exhibitions in terms of their representation of difference within queerness will be evaluated. As with other social and political movements, the concern for equitable representation was a central concern of LGBTIQ social movements, and this issue would become embedded within the new museology (section 2.2). Among the queer Australian exhibitions, the problem of diversity was raised from the outset, initially from lesbian and feminist defiance of male privilege. Despite such challenges, presentations of internal diversity have often been subsumed under general queer exhibitions (i.e. broad LGBTIQ or queer exhibitions that attempt to represent queerness in its entirety). After evaluating the critique, it will be proposed that general queer exhibitions—looking at those starting from a particular geographic area to examine internal difference—can be attuned to intersectional diversity issues. Nevertheless, the exhibitions show that the lack of equitable representation beyond gay male (and to a slightly lesser extent, lesbian) experience remains an acute concern.  The elision of internal diversity under singular conceptions of ‘the gay community’ has been a difficulty since the early queer group exhibitions from 1977. Politics around gender and feminism was the first to expose the exclusionary ways in which it was deployed. While there was overlap between the Women’s Liberation Movement and the Gay Liberation Movement in terms of membership, allied demonstrations, and socialising, there always remained frictions that resulted from the unequal power accorded to men in society (Robinson, 2013). Tensions erupted at the Fourth National Homosexual Conference in 1978 where an artwork in the accompanying exhibition Mistresses and Masterpieces by Dykes and Poofters was slashed (Gray, 2014, p. 10). The stitched and collaged hanging  154 ‘Men Curtain’ by McDiarmid evoked sadomasochistic sex between men and was defaced by a lesbian ‘disturbed by the work’s embodiment of male power’ (Gray, 2006, p. 53). Dissatisfied by the dominance of male concerns within homosexual political movements, many lesbians aligned themselves more closely with the women’s movement, radical feminism, and lesbian feminism. Arguably, by the late 1980s, the wide acceptance of the principles and practices of gender equality strengthened coalitions between women’s and male-dominated groups. Accordingly, ‘lesbian’ was inserted in the titles of many of the previously ‘gay’ and ‘homosexual’ organisations during this period: the Gay Rights Lobby became the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, and the Australian Gay Archives became the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives (Willett, 2000, p. 199). The general shift in terminology from ‘homosexual’ to ‘gay and lesbian’ to ‘LGBT’ to ‘queer’ seen in the exhibition titles from 1977–2016 also marks an increasing concern to reflect the diversity of queer people, if only discursively.  Even given the gains in lesbian visibility, there have been very few exhibitions dedicated to lesbian lives among the Australian queer exhibitions, and almost none dedicated to transgender and other non-normatively gendered identities. An exception is Transit Lounge (29 October–28 November 2013) that opened at the SASA Gallery on Adelaide’s drag culture. Although drag is not necessarily an indication of non-normative gender identity, in the curators’ framing, it ‘constitutes a lived mode of transgression from early forms of female impersonation through to gender re-assignment and transgendered bodies’ (Prosser & Crowley, 2013, p. 60). Another significant exception is Forbidden Love – Bold Passion: An Exhibition of Lesbian Stories 1900s–1990s, the most notable lesbian-specific exhibition that has opened to date. The biographies of nine different women between 1900 and 1990 were presented on panels evoking closet doors alongside objects including photographs, love letters, audio from oral histories, overalls, and a dental dam (Hawley, 1996, p. 20). With funds from the Federal Government’s ‘Visions of Australia’ programme, the exhibition was able to travel to Newcastle, Albury, Melbourne, Hobart, Castlemaine, Adelaide, and two locations in Sydney from 1996–1998 (Mine, 2018). The exhibition curators were consciously resisting the invisibility of lesbian women compared with gay men: ‘Our feeling was that male gay culture had gone mainstream but lesbianism remained an invisible, mysterious, misunderstood and tip-toed around subject’ (Hawley, 1996, p. 20). They viewed the exhibition as an opportunity to bring ‘lesbian stories, images and artefacts  155 into the public domain, claiming a space which was often denied in the past’ (Ford, 1997, p. 24). That the small exhibition remains the most significant lesbian-specific Australian exhibition to date indicates the continuing lack of gendered diversity.  Exhibitions on other lines of diversity such as religion, ethnicity, disability, and indigeneity follow a similar pattern. That is, with several notable exceptions, they tend to be included under general queer exhibitions (e.g. Pride NT: Our Queer History and 25 Years of Inclusion: The Tropical Fruits Inc. A GLBTI Social His/Her/Our/Story) rather than dedicated exhibitions. Exceptions among the exhibitions in Figure 16 include Outing Disability, a photo exhibition featuring LGBTIQ people with disabilities at the Seymour Centre in 2014 which travelled till 2016; Warrali Burrul, an exhibition on Indigenous contributions to the Mardi Gras that opened at the djamu Gallery, a satellite location of the Australian Museum, in 1999; several exhibitions at the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Cooperative; and When Voices Meet Visions: An Exploration of Queer Jewish Identity, which opened at the Jewish Museum of Australia in 2014.  It is claimed that general queer exhibitions overlook the internal diversity within queer communities. One of the strengths of ‘queer’ as a concept is its flexibility in accommodating differences but it has been advised that ‘even when we shelter under it, we must not forget that it homogenizes, erases our differences’ (Anzaldúa, 2009, p. 164), a valid concern which is both a potential strength and weakness of general queer exhibitions. Queer museologist Nicole Robert (2016) argues that broad exhibitions, in being tasked to represent the entire diversity of communities, end up reducing them to inaccurate, singular entities:  Representations of LGBTQ experiences are so rare in museums, that when displays do occur they are often tasked with representing the idea of LGBTQ identities in a monolithic form, rather than representing the particular lives and identities of those who participated. There is, of course, no monolithic experience of being LGBTQ. People who identify as LGBTQ are present across all strata of society. But it is the very rarity of representation that creates a pressure for a single display to speak to the entire range of diverse experiences and identities of those who are LGBTQ (pp. 106–107).  156  In order to counter the arguable tendency towards tokenism in general queer exhibitions, it is proposed that exhibitions dedicated to differences within queer communities are advantageous in complementing relatively privileged LGBTIQ representations. Such critiques have often attached themselves to the category of middle-class, metropolitan ‘gay white men’ as bearers of automatic privilege. Curator Don Romesburg (2014) of the GLBT History Museum, San Francisco, explains the difficulty of navigating the bias in the historical material: ‘[w]ithout constant and specific diligence…holdings will always veer towards those likely to have the space, time, and sense of entitlement to claim a place in history—often well-connected white, gay men’ (p. 135).38 Curator of Prejudice and Pride at the Museum of Brisbane, Carol Low, similarly reflects that ‘[i]t might have been tempting to set the tenor of the exhibition as all colourful outrageousness and camp humour, but, for me, this would have been courting stereotype, and gay male stereotyping at that’ (Low, 2016, p. 225). Rather than disavowing privilege or the discourse of gay pride, a more productive response may be complementing general queer exhibitions with a greater range of exhibitions centring on internal differences.39 An intersectional approach to identity could assist museums to understand the internal complexity of queer experience and its relationship to other categories of identity (Figure 22).                                                  38 The explicit legal and medical attention to male homosexuality partly explains its prominence in legal, medical, media, and archival records. These laws inherited from nineteenth century Britain only forbade the ‘the abominable crime of buggery’ between two men, which became the target of law reform movements across Australia. It led to South Australia becoming the first state to decriminalise male same-sex acts in 1975 with Tasmania becoming the last state to do so in 1997. Historian Rebecca Jennings (2015) reminds us, however, that ‘we must consider silence as a disciplinary mechanism in itself’ in examining the dearth of historical material on lesbianism (p. xvi). 39 An example of the simultaneous staging of general with intersectional exhibitions occurred at the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, in 2009. Rendering Gender, an exhibition on transgender experience, opened alongside the main exhibition sh[OUT] (Sandell, 2017b, p. 121).  157  Figure 22: The intersectionality of categories of experience. Possible attendant forms of marginalisation are placed in brackets  The concept of intersectionality was coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw and developed by black feminists in the USA to analyse the interlocking ‘systems of oppression’ that attach themselves to different categories of experience (Combahee River Collective, 2000, p. 264; originally printed in 1977). According to the framework, interrogating the marginality of black women is irreducible to racism and sexism alone but requires an integrated analysis; moreover, their interests may depart from both African-American and women’s groups. Intersectionality has been developed into a methodological approach that assists in understanding the complexity of identity and discrimination generally, including queer identities. Robert (2014) argues that museum professionals can use the concept to break from the singular and additive way that identities have been addressed in museums (p. 25). While general queer exhibitions purportedly represent the breadth of queer diversity, they have focused on white gay and lesbian experiences (Robert, 2016, p. 136). Her critique of general queer exhibitions is at variance with the critique of physical and conceptual separation (section 6.2.3). That is, while Robert points to the exclusionary effects of general  158 queer exhibitions, Tseliou (2013b) advocates for approaches to exhibitions that ‘interweave sexual minorities’ stories into mainstream museum narratives’ (p. 8), an approach which is even more likely to subsume queer diversity into privileged narratives according to Robert. Their disagreement points to the multiple effects of focusing on specific identities compared with choosing broader groupings. As will now be developed, a particular dimension of analysis—in this case geography—can be the starting point for an extended examination of queer diversity.  In Prejudice and Pride at the Museum of Brisbane, the city boundaries set the borders within which the diversity of LGBTIQ Queenslanders was surveyed. The curator Carol Low (2015, interview) reflected on the complex undertaking and the intersectional approach that was used: ‘How are we going to have all these lives and stories and eras represented? It was an absolute boggle. So we worked from using matrixes almost of different kinds of eras, different kinds of groupings, different ways people identified to work with the representation of our diversities.’ The curator of Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney, Sharon Chalmers (2015, interview), used a similar process of looking at the intersection of the identities of queer people in Western Sydney: ‘I really tried to include combinations of diversity to try and get the complexity of people’s lives, that they weren’t just lesbian, they were Indigenous and lesbian and asked what that meant. Indigenous, lesbian and over 50 – what did that mean in terms of growing up and understanding their own sexuality and what kind of context did that occur in?’ Like Prejudice and Pride, the exhibition used a geographic area, in this case Western Sydney, as a boundary to explore difference within and across those borders (Edges is further examined in section 7.4 ‘Contact zones and constraints’). In explicitly examining the interaction of multiple dimensions of difference—ethnicity, location, indigeneity, age, and numerous others—integrative exhibitions illustrate the crisscrossing ties between queer and non-queer communities.  Categories like geography can therefore be used as starting points to explore internally intersecting queer diversity. Museums may be amenable to the strategy given that they are often delimited to representing a particular national, state, or local area. To use the terminology of intersectionality theory, geography can operate as a basis to explore ‘intracategorical complexity,’ allowing the possibility of making generalisations about  159 queerness but, at the same time, examining its internal complexity (McCall, 2005, p. 1774). An intersectional analysis incorporates the privileges and penalties that come with geography including metronormativity, the narrative that LGBTIQ people can only live a fully ‘out’ life in urban settings, and not in suburban, remote, rural, and regional contexts (Halberstam, 2005, pp. 36–37). Illustrating the influence of metronormativity, the queer Australian exhibitions show a clear bias towards locations in the eastern part of Australia, particularly the cultural hubs of Sydney and Melbourne. Geographer Andrew Gorman-Murray (2008) using a data set of 27 queer exhibitions from 1982 to 2005 concludes that ‘regional histories are few, national and state scale histories are prevalent, and minimal exhibitions occur outside metropolitan areas’ (p. 67). It accords with the analysis of the 55 exhibitions in Figure 16. Noteworthy departures include Hunter Pride that opened at the Newcastle Museum in 1997, Edges and Just Sensational! both of which opened at Liverpool Regional Museum in 2001 and 2002 respectively, You Are Here Now that opened at the University of Newcastle Library in 2009, 25 Years of Inclusion opening at the Lismore Regional Gallery in 2013, and We Are Here: Riverina LGBTIQ Stories that opened at the Museum of the Riverina in 2016 (Figure 23).   160  Figure 23: We Are Here: Riverina LGBTIQ Stories at the Museum of the Riverina, Wagga Wagga (13 September–6 November 2016) with an LGBTIQ timeline as a process of ‘snakes and ladders.’ Image courtesy of the Museum of the Riverina  While geography can be used to explore queer diversity, further questions can be raised concerning the diversity of geographic areas selected. Critical probing is part of the process of diversity work, a process that is never complete but that requires constant monitoring. Curator Viv Szekeres reflects on the process that she applied in her practice at the Migration Museum, Adelaide:  ‘Who is represented and why, who gets marginalised in the process and who gets left out altogether?’ When someone or some group is chosen for representation, which bits of their knowledge or experience shall we represent and whose interest will be served? Whose account shall we listen to when there are conflicting accounts and which bits shall we select out? One final question is of particular  161 relevance to issues surrounding Aboriginality, gender, sexuality and ethnicity: ‘Who is permitted to speak on behalf of whom?’ (Szekeres, 1995, p. 63).  This difficult self-interrogation applies to all museum work and representation. In the current section, the use of geography by exhibition developers was examined, but any other dimension of difference can be the starting point of the exercise. The multiform differences certainly extend beyond gender, ethnicity, and geography as explored here, and even beyond the categories in Figure 22. Thus, while the current analysis is limited to several categories, it should be extended to any category included in (and excluded from) queer exhibitions. Among the already-limited public representations of queerness, those who experience multiple degrees of difference or marginality are additionally sidelined.  The concern to reflect the diversity of queer communities has existed since queer exhibitions started appearing in the late 1970s, with similar concerns articulated within the new museology. Lesbian women became the vanguard for the cause but, although gains have been made, public representation of LGBTIQ identities still remain skewed towards non-transgender, metropolitan, gay white men. There has been even less success in reflecting the experiences of disabled, bisexual, non-normatively gendered, non-metropolitan, minority ethnic, and Indigenous queer people. While general queer exhibitions have been critiqued for their failure to reflect internal difference, it was shown that they could be starting points to do so. Rather, it was argued that identity-specific exhibitions, and those that focus on intersectional locations within queer communities, have distinctive and complementary qualities that can be harnessed through critical, self-reflexive practice.  6.3 Conclusion  Exhibitions, fundamental to contemporary understandings of museums, are central to increasing queer inclusion within museums. As the evaluation of queer exhibitions between 1977 and 2016 showed, many exhibitions have led to critical queer inclusion in Australian museums. However, commentators within (queer) museum studies and beyond have tended to favour one approach over others: public over community-based; umbrella, integrated, or thematic over physically and conceptually separate; sustained and permanent over  162 temporary or festival-based; broadly themed over a focus on HIV/AIDS; and presenting a diverse range of identities over identity-specific exhibitions. It may be due to factors including the limited number of cases available in the emerging field of queer museology, or the perceived need to position arguments firmly on either side of the museum / community divide. While the critiques that favour one approach over others are all valid, the Australian case studies demonstrated that supposed limitations could also be enabling in other ways.  The chapter affirmed that queering exhibitions requires an awareness of the multiple effects of exhibition decisions, not a singular model, but one where the result of flows between theoretical positions and queer interventions cannot be determined ahead of time. It leaves open a broader range of exhibitionary tactics, the effects of which must be navigated by exhibition developers. Nevertheless, as was seen in the case study of Prejudice and Pride at the Museum of Brisbane, queer-identified advocates within public museums are often required for such programming to occur. It points to the continuing need to support community-based spaces including QCHOs and festivals for public representations of queerness. The tensions between public museums and queer communities is further explored in the next chapter ‘Queering connections.’ It expands the relationships considered here by looking at the interfaces between queer communities, museums, and audiences. In addition, it looks at the conditions under which they productively connect rather than disengage. Some contexts in which negotiations play out include museum education, responses to controversy, debates over whether community or institutional domains are ‘better’ locations for queer objects, and in their collaborative projects.   163 7 Queering connections  Communities can feel that museums are not relevant to them if they do not find within them a sense of their own history, identity and belonging.…Working with communities either inside museum walls or in the form of outreach activities can be seen as some kind of way of broadening the power sharing and of making museums more relevant to more people (Watson, 2007, pp. 10–11).  Museums have generally not been relevant to queer communities due to an absence of ‘a sense of their own history, identity and belonging.’ Attending to the issue, in addition to the areas of museum practice discussed so far, involves looking at the overlapping relationship between queer communities, museums, and their audiences both ‘inside museum walls’ and through ‘outreach activities.’ This chapter will examine several points of contact between these groups—learning environments, negotiations around collections, and collaborative processes—to analyse the conditions under which more equitable relations are supported. The renegotiations that are occurring in museums in the areas of learning, orientations towards controversy, and sharing of authority form the background to queer engagements but they occur within deeply rooted constraints. As will be established, additional barriers affect queer inclusion. Queering connections requires working with and against barriers to make museums more relevant to queer communities.  There has been a shift in museum learning to incorporate the identities and experiences of visitors but, as the first section determines, the aspiration is incomplete in relation to LGBTIQ learners, both youth and adult. Part of the reticence around becoming more relevant to queer communities comes from the avoidance of controversy. As will be conveyed in the second section, a more productive approach is to neither seek nor avoid controversy, but to mediate conflict if it does occur. In entering the political arena, museums forgo authorial control and, as the following section argues, should recognise the unique contributions that queer community groups offer to the interpretation of their heritage. The last section considers the many constraints that have stood in the way of equitable partnerships, but also signals the promise of reflective practice.   164 7.1 Queer relevance and museum learning  Education and learning have been central to the mission of museums since the formation of public museums, if not in practice then in aspiration. After a literature review of current expectations of museum learning experiences—among other things, that they will be tailored to the experiences and identities of visitors—this section will translate the implications of current approaches for LGBTIQ audiences. Australian museums have, by and large, been of limited queer relevance. As will be affirmed, queer relevance does not have to splinter museum activities but can add new, broadly appealing learning experiences.  The second half of the nineteenth century saw a great expansion in the number of museums worldwide. Against the backdrop of increasing industrialisation and urbanisation, they began to be viewed by governments as instruments of social instruction (Hein, 2002, p. 4). The South Kensington Museum (now the V&A), UK, was established in 1852 for this purpose, namely to encourage industry and provide examples of excellence in applied arts and sciences. Its founding director, Henry Cole, placed education at the centre of its enterprise: ‘For my own part, I venture to think that unless museums and galleries are made subservient to the purposes of education, they dwindle into very sleepy and useless institutions’ (cited in Alexander, 1983, p. 159). The Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, which has its origins in the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, looked to the South Kensington Museum as a template.40 It too sought to encourage productive industries via public display and education (MacLeod, 2005; Taksa, 2005). The same educational imperative attended the boom in Australian museum construction during this period.  While Australian museums, especially since the latter half of the nineteenth century, have considered their role to involve the edification of the public, most resources were given over to didactic public exhibitions and lectures (McDonald, 1979, p. 152). As museum                                                 40 In the lead-up to the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, the trustees of the Australian Museum submitted a proposal for the Technological, Industrial, and Sanitary Museum of New South Wales to the NSW Government. Before the museum could open, the building where its collection was housed, the Garden Palace, burnt down in 1882. In 1893, the museum re-opened as the Technological Museum. It is now known as the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (2013c).  165 learning scholar Janette Griffin (2011) points out, the importance accorded to museum educators in Australia has been inconsistent. According to her, even by the 1980s, ‘many institutions had only one educator who, because of their professional isolation, needed to be assertive and actively promote their ideas and their profession’; their concerns regarding exhibition development were also sidelined next to the role of curators (n.p.). Things have arguably changed since the ‘educational turn’ with the establishment of education departments, growth in a sub-field of literature, and prominence of special interest groups like the Museums Australia education networks (O'Neill & Wilson, 2010). The effect has been to consolidate the position of education within museum organisations.  Nevertheless, understandings of museum education have changed dramatically. There has been a shift away from ‘education’ to ‘learning’ in language and approach with the former ‘perceived to be passive, formal, being told to do something, imposed, not chosen, associated negatively with school and teachers, hard work, structured and systematic’ (Kelly, 2007, p. 277). ‘Learning,’ on the other hand, came to signify the antithesis of these qualities. As opposed to the formal education of schools, museums offered ‘free-choice learning’ environments for all ages where learning changes from ‘something that everyone needs to do all the time…[to] something that everyone will consciously want to do all the time’ (Falk, Dierking, & Adams, 2006, p. 324; emphasis in original). As well as freely coming to museums, learners were considered to participate actively in the construction of meaning. Following constructivist theories, learning would be open-ended and shift according to personal, physical, and sociocultural contexts (Hein, 2002, pp. 34–36). Theoretically, such attributes would all feed into the enjoyment of the learning experiences negotiated within museums.  According to current understandings, the museum user experience occurs in the interaction of visitors’ identities with the museum. John Falk (2009) argues in Identity and the Museum Visitor Experience that identity-related needs are crucial to a predictive model of the encounter. However, ‘identity’ is used in an unconventional way. He distinguishes between ‘big I’ identities—for example, gender, ethnicity, and class—and ‘little I’ identities which ‘respond to the needs and realities of the specific moment and situation’ (p. 73). Examples of the latter include:    166 Generalized psychological characteristics or traits (e.g., introverted), physical features (e.g., red hair), roles (e.g., father), abilities (e.g., bilingual), tastes (e.g., preference for French red wines), attitudes (e.g., against the death penalty), behaviors (e.g., I work a lot) and explicit group or category membership (e.g., member of the Communist party) (Simon, 2004, p. 46 as cited in Falk, 2009, p. 78).  Falk argues that the aggregate of identity-related visitor motivations, combined with their satisfaction by museums, provides the best explanatory framework for the museum experience. Although recognising the value of representational critiques of museums, he nonetheless claims that ‘big I’ identities ‘provide relatively little explanatory power’ (p. 11). A benefit of his position is that it caters for the multitude of reasons why people visit or do not visit museums beyond ‘big I’ identity affirming reasons. Falk and Dierking (2012) incorporate the whole suite of reasons into common visitor profiles including explorers, facilitators, professionals / hobbyists, experience seekers, rechargers, respectful pilgrims, and affinity seekers (p. 62). While LGBTIQ people can fall into nearly all of the preceding categories, they are not permitted to be ‘affinity seekers’ in the sense of finding queer connections. Even if attendance rates for queer communities are assumed to be as high as the rest of the population, they have rarely been given opportunities to seek out queer affinities.41  There are, then, queer identity-related needs to which museum programmes are not catering. Chief among these is the need for an affirmative history, something that was recognised in the preamble of the Museums Australia policy, Gay & Lesbian Policy Guidelines for Museum Programs and Practice (section 4.3). Moore et al. (2014) summarise the issue cogently:  LGBTQ people are a minority that exists both interdependent with and independent of the biological family. Therefore, each generation faces the task of inventing a life                                                 41  No extended audience research has been conducted on LGBTIQ audiences in Australian museums. Market Attitude Research Services (1995) evaluated the exhibition Don’t Leave Me This Way but did not mention LGBTIQ demographics. Reports of relevant exhibitions and events by the Australian Museum (2015b) Audience Research Unit also did not consider such demographics (section 4.5: Measuring value).  167 for itself, often without the help of family or extended relations. Although each generation of LGBTQ people tries to pass on its strengths, skills, cultures, and traditions to the next, in fact most youth grow up without knowledge of the histories of people like themselves, or with the awareness that people like themselves even have a history. This absence of a grounding history, and this sense that they are nowhere reflected in the history they learn in school, can add to the alienation that gay youth experience simply by virtue of growing up in heteronormative families, communities, and religious traditions (p. 2).  While no studies have been conducted on LGBTIQ learning experiences in Australian museums, they are likely to reflect statistics from the USA that only 4% of queer youth between the ages of 14 and 19 have learnt about LGBT history in museums (Müller, 2001). Far from being safe spaces for LGBTIQ people, places of learning like schools are sites where incidences of abuse are concentrated: in 2010, it was found that 61% of LGBTIQ young people reported verbal homophobic abuse and 18% reported physical violence particularly in schools, major factors in the LGBTIQ suicide rate being five times higher than non-LGBTIQ people aged 16 to 27 (Hillier et al., 2010, p. ix; National LGBTI Health Alliance, 2016). In museums, while there have been several exhibitions that have focused on queer youth in Australia including a series of annual exhibitions coinciding with the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism, and Transphobia (Baldas, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2012) and OUT at the Museum: Queer Youth of SA (Migration Museum, 2016), little documentation exists on tailored education programmes and resources for queer exhibitions. One exception is Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney which served as the launch venue for a queer youth support video ‘designed for schools and other youth centres as a tool for anti-homophobia workshops’ (Manganas, 2001, p. 9). Another is the exhibition The 80s Are Back which opened at the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (2011) that made available teachers’ notes with descriptions of the themes of partying and the AIDS Crisis under which the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and the AIDS Memorial Quilt appeared. The evidence suggests that the reticence about mentioning queerness beyond cursory (in the second example also stereotypical) appearances, especially to young people, is common in public institutions.   168 Beyond tailoring learning experiences to queer youth, there has been a similar lack of attempts to provide relevant learning experiences for queer adults. The UK leads the way on this front through the introduction of LGBTIQ tours at prominent national institutions. The British Museum runs periodic tours highlighting objects relevant to LGBTIQ experiences; visitors can also direct themselves to associated objects using the resulting publication A Little Gay History: Diversity and Desire Across the World (Parkinson, 2013). Taking the British Museum as a precedent, the V&A now offers tours of its collection interpreted through an LGBTIQ perspective. Significantly, V&A curator Dawn Hoskin explains that the tours do not segregate queerness but, alongside the other activities of the museum, convey ‘recognition of LGBTQ communities and individuals as being a valued part of wider societies, and contributing elements of wider social histories, rather than being considered only as a distinct “special interest”’ (Vo, 2015). In Australia, no such permanent tours exist, although tours may accompany temporary queer exhibitions during queer festivals, for example, that led by Varushka Darling through the permanent collection coinciding with Adman: Warhol before Pop and the 2017 Mardi Gras (Figure 24). They frequently use queer readings to layer queer narratives humorously onto museum objects.42                                                  42 In the foreground of Figure 24 is a replica of Frederic Leighton’s Athlete Struggling with a Python of which the guide says, ‘it’s exactly what you think.…It looks like a spitting cobra as well.’ Leighton’s sexuality has been the subject of contention with the brochure of the Leighton House Museum in London reading ‘Leighton never married…[and there is] the supposition that Leighton may have been homosexual’ (Sandell, 2017b, p. 77). In the background is The Anatomy Class at the École des Beaux-Arts by François Sallé, which the guide remarks, ‘deals with one of the most important parts of getting ready for Mardi Gras…taking the perfect Grindr pic [a gay socialising phone application].’ The tour is also notable for queering the permanent exhibitions where there are often few explicit queer resonances.  169  Figure 24: Queer tour by Varushka Darling on 01/03/17 coinciding with Adman: Warhol before Pop at the Art Gallery of New South Wales (25 February–28 March 2017)43  Queer-relevant programming such as queer tours and exhibitions has been infrequent in Australian museums. ‘Relevance’ was used in section 5.4 to demarcate objects that may have LGBTIQ significance either through direct provenance, association, or through queer readings. Queer relevance, then, can overlay itself on existing museum understandings rather than replacing dominant meanings. It can be extended to queer-relevant learning experiences using the work of Nina Simon (2016), Director of the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History (MAH). She uses the metaphor of the museum being a room that can be entered into through a locked door: ‘relevance is the key to a locked room where meaning lives’ (p. 23). Some barriers to engaging with audiences who do not have access to the room include: not being able to see the doors (audiences are not aware of the services provided by the museum), opening doors slightly wider rather than building new doors (not adapting to visitors on their own terms), building new doors alone (not collaborating), constructing false doors (creating temporary programmes without changing the room), and constructing new anterooms (segregating ‘special’ programmes). Instead, Simon argues that the strongest path is to maintain a room with a singular mission, and to open as many                                                 43 See footnote 42.  170 doors as possible as ‘[t]he more doors you open, the more relevant you will be’ (pp. 156–157). In the case of the queer tour occurring during Adman: Warhol before Pop, the Art Gallery of New South Wales was opening more ‘doors’ to interpret its permanent collection, providing another lens for all visitors, not just those who visited the temporary exhibition.  Simon (2016) observes that ‘programs that emphasize bringing diverse people together are now more popular than those that serve homogenous groups’ (p. 116). While it is recognised that these ‘umbrella’ programmes can integrate LGBTIQ diversity within a broad conception of social diversity, the result of ostensibly inclusive and diverse museum practice has been the invisibility of queerness. Hence, it was argued previously that such programming is required alongside queer-specific undertakings (see sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4). Nevertheless, there is evidence that queer-specific exhibitions can have a broad appeal. Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS received 14 times the number of visitors the gallery expected and attracted the youngest audience profile in over a decade (Bunyan, 2014). Despite being visited by children and school groups, the exhibition encountered no controversy. While catering to the identity-related needs of LGBTIQ visitors to these programmes, it also successfully engaged with broader audiences. Using Simon’s metaphor, although LGBTIQ anterooms were created—albeit ones that have not been reopened since—these were temporarily welcoming of queer visitors as queer visitors.   It has long been held that an important, if not the most important, purpose of the museum is to educate the public. Approaches to education have shifted to more active understandings of learning, which furthermore accommodate the experiences and identities of learners. The aspiration is incomplete in so far as they have not considered the identity-related needs of LGBTIQ audiences, especially in Australia compared to overseas efforts. Catering to visitor needs through tailored learning experiences for all ages not only makes museums more relevant to queer communities, but can also provide appealing experiences for audiences more broadly. Doing so requires that museums accept the risk of controversy, particularly in programming involving youth.    171 7.2 Utilising controversy  The inclusion of queer communities within museums often attracts controversy drawing upon the discourse of protecting children and families, frequently resulting in censorship and self-censorship. This section considers two positions on controversy in museums: one that avoids controversy either pragmatically or due to the belief that museums should be politically neutral spaces; and the other exemplified by the Migration Museum, Adelaide, that neither courts nor avoids controversy, but prepares for it in order to present marginalised experiences. It will be argued that the latter approach should be favoured in order to strategically push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in museums and the public sphere.  Museums are political through the choices they make whether or not acknowledged. As the director of the National Museums Liverpool, David Fleming (2016) observes, ‘every comment they make is an opinion that could be opposed; every object they choose to display is loaded with meaning; every decision to omit something from display could be disputed’ (p. 74). Museums in Australia produce political effects through their general exclusion of non-normative sex, gender, and sexual diversity. As they are ‘sites of finely structured normative argument’ (Luke, 2002, p. xxiv), the result has been the normalisation of heterosexuality and the marginalisation of non-heterosexuality as ‘abnormal.’ Controversy has often resulted from the inclusion of queerness in Australian museums precisely because such representations have sought to critique heteronormativity and legitimise non-heterosexual ways of being. Dubin (1999) argues that ‘these cultural battles…alert us to where the fault lines lie in our society’ (p. 2). Importantly, he adds that ‘the outbreak of conflict occurs when power is shifting and the relative status of different groups is in flux’ (p. 5). Controversy may be an indication of the pressure that is being placed on heterosexual norms and institutions, possibly leading to more inclusive attitudes.  Museum scholar Fiona Cameron (2003), one of the project investigators of the important Australian study ‘Exhibitions as Contested Sites,’ explains:  Controversial subjects include taboo topics, sensitive issues, a particular historical interpretation or an artwork that embodies an idea, or questions that have a divisive  172 dimension, raising alternative answers while challenging an individual’s or group’s values, beliefs, ideologies or moral position (p. 7).  Queerness connects with the definition at multiple points, with the access that children have to representations of queerness being the flashpoint for many controversies. The near absence of tailored education experiences tying into queer programming, as well as the censuring of the federal Safe Schools programme,44 all point to the pervasive notion that children should not be ‘exposed’ to non-heteronormative influences. One of the objections to the exhibition Prejudice and Pride discussed in section 4.2 ‘Leadership’ was its alleged availability to primary and secondary school children (Nile, 1994). Even as a representative of the Minister for the Arts defended the exhibition, he added that ‘[p]artitions were constructed around the exhibition to restrict access.…Notices were placed at the entrance…recommending adult guidance’ even though he said that ‘[t]here was no material of an explicit nature in the exhibition’ (Hannaford, 1994). While tacit expressions of sexuality celebrating heteronormative families and relationships are commonplace, queer counterparts are largely forbidden (Austin et al., 2012, p. 188; Vanegas, 2002, p. 105).  There has been a continuous history of Australian exhibitions that have met with controversy because of the inaccurate association of non-heterosexuality and child abuse. Queer artist Paul Yore was charged with producing child pornography after he exhibited a collage featuring children’s faces superimposed on images of male bodies, charges that were dropped on the ground of artistic expression (Russell & Cooper, 2014). While the debate concerning the seizing of photographic works by Bill Henson in 2008 concerned the sexualisation of children, some commentators conflated the issue with the supposed                                                 44 The Safe Schools Coalition Australia was a federal and state-funded programme to encourage safe and inclusive schools for LGBTIQ students, families, and staff. Beginning as a program in Victorian schools in 2010 and expanding nationally in 2013, it was only in 2016 that it became a major issue with criticism of the programme coming from Christian right groups such as the Australian Christian Lobby and various conservative Liberal Party politicians (Shannon & Smith, 2017, pp. 247–249). The Federal Government ceased funding the programme in October 2016 (Urban, 2016). As of 2017, only the State of Victoria has continued funding of a similar scheme under the ‘Safe Schools’ banner, with other states and territories distancing themselves from the controversy (Urban, 2017), another example of Victorian leadership (section 4.2).  173 ‘subculture of pedophilia among gays’ (Sheehan, 2008). The touring exhibition Forbidden Love – Bold Passion: An Exhibition of Lesbian Stories 1900s–1990s, was met with resistance at multiple venues: the Albury City Council unsuccessfully attempted to ban it; the Newcastle Museum was lobbied to have the exhibition closed or partitioned off; and Penrith councillor Jim Aitken described the exhibition as ‘distasteful’ (Pride History Group, 2015). Teachers from one school were reported to have formed a barricade around the exhibition to prevent access to students (Ford & Isaac, 1999, p. 11), and a remark in the comment book highlighted by one of the curators condemned, ‘[w]hy put rubbish like this in a museum for families. You are weirdos, not normal. Stay behind doors where you belong’ (Ford, 1997, p. 24). Over and above restrictions on access of sexual material to children, non-explicit queer material encounters other barriers to its use in education from associations suggested by words like ‘obscene,’ ‘promiscuous,’ ‘deviant,’ ‘abnormal,’ ‘immoral,’ and even ‘predatory.’ It has led to queer invisibility and self-censorship in risk-averse museums as found in an international survey by the Swedish Exhibition Agency (2016, p. 58), and physical and conceptual separation through measures such as age prohibitions and recommendations.  In the above examples, resistance to queer inclusion in museums is justified through the discourse of protecting children. The resulting censorship or attempted censorship, as queer museologist Jennifer Tyburczy observes, is almost always for the protection of heterosexual adult sensibilities rather than children: ‘For me, when people talk about “children,” they’re really talking about white, male, straight sensibility.…And that we’re actually going to be offending that person instead’ (cited in Ryan, 2015, p. 96). Queer theorist Lee Edelman (2004) calls this process that maintains heterosexual privilege and queer invisibility ‘reproductive futurism,’ ‘compel[ling] us…to submit to the framing of the political debate’ (p. 2). That is, any argument that seeks to present queerness alongside normative heterosexuality must situate itself within the discourse of protecting children. As Edelman explains, the welfare of actual children is secondary in the discourse, to say nothing of the possibility that LGBTIQ children or parents may be visiting. Acceding to the logic in museums means that many of the limited queer interventions are partitioned off or carry warning signs (Figure 25). It is evident that the issue in many cases is not just sexuality in general but queerness itself.   174  Figure 25: 18+ recommendation sign for the MELT Portrait Prize exhibition at the Brisbane Powerhouse (3–28 February 2016), 08/02/16  Attitudes to LGBTIQ diversity and the trope of ‘protecting children’ constrain what museums can do. Two responses from museums operating in this environment will now be considered. The first is the attempt to avoid controversy, a response encouraged by the increasing financial vulnerability of public museums. The second results from the belief that museums should be politically neutral. Hancocks (1987) concurs with the latter when she states that ‘[m]useums should resist any temptation to submit to advocacy or lobbying, no matter how strongly the staff may feel toward a subject’ (p. 188). The effects of both responses are the same, however: the museum remains nominally heterosexual; the notion that youth should be protected from queerness is bolstered; and programming may be delayed, neutralised to reflect rather than challenge social norms, or separated from other programming (Sandell & Frost, 2010, p. 127). The consequence for Forbidden Love – Bold Passion was that the organisers could not secure museum venues for the exhibition in Western Australia, Queensland, and the Northern Territory despite sponsorship from the federal ‘Visions of Australia’ programme that specifically provides funds for touring (Ford & Isaac, 1999, p. 11).   175 Proponents of avoiding controversy have cited its absence during exhibitions including Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS and Mapplethorpe at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (Harper, 2004, p. 66). However, such examples can only be given in retrospect and arguably result from factors that are outside the museum’s control. Thus, while the Robert Mapplethorpe retrospective was well received in Sydney (23 February–30 April 1995), when the same exhibition travelled to the Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth, it generated fierce controversy (22 June–6 August 1995) (Nguyen, 2016). The state government-funded organisation Healthway refused to sponsor the exhibition, against the recommendation of its own arts advisory panel (The West Australian, 1995). And astoundingly, the Liberal Health Minister Graham Kierath whose portfolio supported Healthway said that, ‘[a]t best, some of them could be called blatantly pornographic.…At worst, they are nauseating, perverse, sleazy and depraved’ (O’Malley, 1995). It can be surmised that a mixture of cultural and political differences between Perth and Sydney resulted in the diametric receptions. The occurrence of controversy had little to do with how the respective galleries managed the exhibition. Instead of attempting to prevent controversy by avoiding particular subjects, successful accounts of utilising it involved preparing for its possibility.  The second approach to controversy around queer inclusion is to neither seek nor avoid it, but to respond appropriately if it does arise. The History Trust of South Australia (HTSA)—the umbrella organisation for the Migration Museum, South Australian Maritime Museum, and the National Motor Museum—exemplified the approach through the Migration Museum and the former Constitutional Museum. As discussed in section 6.2.3, the latter was a museum of political history that contained the first community gallery in Australia, the Speakers’ Corner. According to the former director of the Migration Museum, Viv Szekeres (1992), ‘it was a way of presenting controversial issues which could encourage debate and dialogue with the museum visitor’ (p. 19). While the Speakers’ Corner was to develop a history of dealing with controversial issues, most museums in Australia avoided controversy. According to the Pigott Report (section 2.2), ‘museums, where appropriate, should display controversial issues. In our view, too many museums concentrate on certainty and dogma, thereby forsaking the function of stimulating legitimate doubt and thoughtful discussion’ (Pigott et al., 1975, p. 73). The conditions the  176 report was criticising made the sustained practices of HTSA and its museums all the more remarkable.  It is not surprising that the first queer public museum exhibition in Australia opened within the amenable environment provided by the Migration Museum. Becoming Visible: Lesbians & Male Homosexuals – From Oppression to Liberation opened in the Speakers’ Corner, covering the history of homosexuality in South Australia. It was probably the first time, true to its title, that homosexuality had become visible in a public museum with the community retaining primary authority. Exhibitions that opened in the space prior to Becoming Visible include Do We Want Nuclear Power? by the group Campaign Against Nuclear Energy and Sixty Years of Struggle for Socialism 1920–1980 by the Communist Party of Australia, showing that the museum had a prior history of engaging with controversial topics and groups. In the lead-up to the exhibition, the local tabloid The News ran the article ‘Storm brews on “gay” exhibition’ (Dare, 1982). The storm never eventuated with only one complaint letter and a small number of telephone calls received. Balanced against the fact that it was the first meaningful engagement between a public museum and a queer community in Australia, it was a gainful outcome.  Even before the exhibition opened, the museum prepared for controversy. Education officer Mark Blencowe told the press, ‘[w]hile we obviously don’t go out of our way to offend any group in society, we aim to present some controversial issues in an historical light’ (Dare, 1982). After the exhibition opened, both the director of HTSA and the director of the museum were prompt in defending the exhibition to the complainants and the Minister for the Arts (similar to the actions of Des Griffin discussed in section 4.2). The strategy of neither seeking nor avoiding controversy continues, and has been carried on to recent engagements between the museum and Adelaidean LGBTIQ communities, sustaining ‘since its inception…a culture of curating difficult subjects’ (Cameron, 2003, p. 31). In 2016, the Migration Museum hosted the exhibition OUT at the Museum: Queer Youth of SA (7 September–2 December 2016) (Figure 26). Once again, HTSA was innovative in hosting the first exhibition on sex, gender, and sexually diverse young people in Australia. Moreover, it did so using a similar format to Becoming Visible by opening the exhibition within the Forum Community Access Gallery (adopting the community gallery format used for the Speakers’ Corner at the former Constitutional Museum). Despite most museums  177 avoiding the subject due to actual and perceived resistance, the Migration Museum chose to cover it because ‘young people are rarely heard, particularly young people who are not highly privileged in one way or another’ (Sullivan, 2016, interview). The museum received four complaints, including from a person who claimed their grandchildren had been ‘exposed’ (ibid.).   Figure 26: OUT at the Museum: Queer Youth of SA in the community gallery at the Migration Museum (7 September–2 December 2016), 04/11/16  Working within the constraints of the museum but also pushing against them is a strategic exercise of compromise according to Migration Museum curator Nikki Sullivan (2016, interview): ‘my attempts to [radically transform the museum] often meet with resistance.…It is about always having to compromise.’ While upholding an oppositional stance to museums has been politically effective, reading ‘along the grain’ and not just ‘against the grain’ of the museum—the latter tactic often leading to dismissing the museum as inevitably queerphobic—allows greater attention to the activist potential of museums (Stoler, 2009, p. 50; Witcomb, 2003, p. 167). Two of the strategies used and compromises made by Sullivan include: variously deploying the terms ‘LGBTIQ’ and ‘queer’ depending on which was more acceptable and understandable to different audiences (politicians, queer communities, non-queer communities, and museum staff); and the use of instrumental  178 arguments such as increasing visitor numbers in order to leverage programmes undertaken on ethical grounds (‘I want to argue that you can actually appropriate that language within the sector to make it work for yourself to queer the sector’ [Sullivan, 2016, interview]). Sullivan reflects that in pursuing queer inclusion within the constraints of the museum, ‘you have got to know when to push and when to hold back and think, “they won’t let me do it that way. That’s really annoying but I have to give up this battle to win the war”’ (ibid.). One of the outcomes of the ‘war’ is the celebration of queer communities on their own terms. Utilising controversy is a crucial tactic in the exercise according to the gay Australian historian Garry Wotherspoon (1999):  [A]ny exhibition showing the creations of a culture long despised in Australia would undoubtedly cause some to pause, even to feel a shock. Yet there is value in that shock. Indeed, the educative process often starts with shock, and then moves on to considering the issues, to understanding, to tolerance, and then to acceptance (p. 13).  Utilising controversy by challenging and perhaps shocking visitors and potential critics can push the limits of acceptance. It accepts the role of the museum as an always-already political institution with the power to include and exclude groups. Historically, such power has been used to exclude queerness, if not because of controversy then, more often than not, through fear of controversy. However, a more commendable response is anticipating controversy, and mediating public dialogue if it does eventuate. Public museums have an important part to play in shifting perceptions of queerness as ‘shocking’ but, as the next section will argue, their actions exist alongside community efforts.  7.3 Community-based versus institutional settings  The tension between museums and communities has run throughout the thesis. In this section, the discord will be explored by looking at its effects on the housing of the Australian AIDS Memorial Quilt (AAMQ) which is now located in both domains. It will be advanced that neither is a ‘better’ custodian of the quilt but that each has distinct effects on its accessibility and meaning. These qualities can form the basis of equitable collaboration.  179 However, as the fraught negotiation for the return of one of the quilt panels confirms, these difficult encounters occur in conditions of mistrust and misunderstanding.   The lack of queer inclusion in Australian museums has meant that queer communities do not see them as very relevant to advancing their cultural or political goals. The invigoration of the gay and lesbian movement from the 1970s emphasised the value of self-representation, a critique of hostile institutions, and forming collectives around those aligned to one’s political and sexual identities. In response, community-based organisations such as the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives (ALGA) and the Victorian AIDS Council (VAC), both based in Melbourne, were formed. These organisations have been essential to the provision of services and preservation of historical material. However, community organisations are also fragile and often short-lived. One possible result for queer community archives if they do close is deposition into public repositories, with a consequent loss of connection with their founding communities. Nick Henderson (2015, interview), a committee member of ALGA, comments:  If you look at the [Jane] Mazer [Lesbian] Archives in LA or the ONE [National Gay & Lesbian Archives] or the Victorian Women’s Liberation and Feminist Archives at the University of Melbourne, there’s not a lot of facility for community engagement in the sense of volunteers, in the sense of having a community space and having it be community-controlled. I think [space] is important but in a kind of community building context, community defining context, and others. To an extent, that content has lost its community connectivity.  The Victorian Women’s Liberation and Lesbian Feminist Archives (VWLLFA) was started as a community-run archive in 1982. In 1999, it was decided that a more accessible and public space was required for the collection. After several options were investigated, it was decided in 2000 that the collection would move to the University of Melbourne Archives. As VWLLFA still maintains a separate identity and continues to act as custodians of the material by accessioning new items into its collection (Victorian Women’s Liberation and Lesbian Feminist Archives, 2010), it is arguably a productive compromise. Given the desire for a more easily accessed location, the University of Melbourne Archives may indeed have offered the best option. Further, in line with arguments made in previous chapters, it is an  180 effective way of integrating queerness in the broader diversity of society. It is held that the most important factor in the process of deciding whether to remain independent, to work with public institutions (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums), or indeed to be subsumed within them, is that such decisions are on the terms of the community group. This is the basis used to now evaluate the management of the AAMQ.  The bulk of the Quilt is managed by the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (MAAS), Sydney, and the AIDS Memorial Candlelight Vigil & Quilt Project, Melbourne (‘the Victorian Quilt Project’). As a public museum and a community-based committee, respectively, the organisations allow us to compare the effect that each has on the accessibility and meaning of the quilts. The conversation that occurred when the Victorian Quilt Project negotiated for the return of one of the quilt panels from MAAS shows the significantly different conventions of the two in relation to objects in their care.  The use of quilts to memorialise those who had died of complications from AIDS started in the USA (see section 6.2.5: HIV/AIDS). Deliberately the size of a grave plot (90 cm x 180 cm), each panel would be stitched into a block of 8 panels, which in turn were displayed in halls and fields where visitors could walk among them (Figure 27). Cleve Jones stitched the first panel of the USA quilt in 1987 and founded the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt the same year (NAMES Project) (Hawkins, 1996, p. 137). Friends, family, and lovers added their own, attended unfolding ceremonies where the quilts were ritually unfurled, and recited the litany of names to counter the anonymity of the mounting deaths. The NAMES Project has grown to over 48,000 panels which represent a fraction of AIDS-related deaths in the USA (The NAMES Project Foundation, 2016). After seeing the panels, Andrew Carter and Richard Johnson started the AAMQ Project in 1988. Elizabeth Woodhams (2004), former national convenor of the project, recalls that there were 44 panels when it was first unfolded in 1988 and it grew to 500 three years later (pp. 144–145). There are now over 800 which represent a small percentage of the 6,459 deaths resulting from AIDS in Australia (Bowtell, 2005, p. 5). Both the USA and Australian quilts were created by members and allies of queer communities to memorialise loved ones, but also—like exhibitions on HIV/AIDS (section 6.2.5)—were intended to have a broader impact on how HIV/AIDS was viewed and managed.   181  Figure 27: Display of the Australian AIDS Memorial Quilt at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre (5–6 April 1997). Image courtesy of Mannie De Saxe  AIDS quilts were created in community contexts, and many including the USA quilts and the Victorian quilts are still managed by community-based organisations. Others, like the quilts from Sydney, are now part of the collections of public museums. Similar to the VWLLFA, the Sydney Quilt Project approached a public institution to take over management of their collection. Unlike with other community collections, the reason for the deposition was not lack of resources—indeed, the project was able to raise $90,000 to contribute to the storage needs of the quilt (Dunkin, 2012)—but rather changes in the nature of the epidemic and, according to the last Sydney convenor Philip Diment (2016, interview), because of the belief that this history should be integrated into broader social narratives. As antiretroviral medications became available in the mid-1990s, living with HIV became a manageable long-term condition, which also meant that few new panels were being added. After negotiations with MAAS from 2005, the quilts came to the museum in 2007 and the usual processes followed: documentation was collected and checked; research on the significance of the objects was undertaken; contact was made with the makers to determine their access and privacy conditions; and storage and display solutions were devised to conserve the objects (Figure 28). The museum has since displayed portions of the quilt in the exhibitions 80s Are Back, HIV and AIDS 30 Years On: The Australian Story, and annually for World AIDS Day.  182   Figure 28: AIDS quilts at the MAAS Castle Hill storage facility, 07/06/16  Museum processes contrast markedly with the practices of the Victorian Quilt Project. The Victorian quilts have been put to the same uses since the founding of the project, and remain closely connected to the family, friends, and lovers of the deceased. They are currently housed in space donated by the VAC, another organisation that is closely connected to the gay community in particular; indeed, key founders were also important figures within the Gay Liberation Movement (Robinson, 2014, pp. 97–98). As well as being displayed for World AIDS Day alongside a candlelight vigil, the quilts remain easily accessible to community groups who wish to display them. Some key differences are evident here between the approach of MAAS and the Victorian Quilt Project to the objects. One is their different conception of care for the objects. As with other public museums, MAAS has the aim of ‘collecting, preserving and documenting…material culture’ (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2015b, p. 4). The Victorian Quilt Project also places great importance on the care of the objects, but the connection to community is integral to notions of care. Practices that would be avoided in museums are common in community-based contexts such as handling the quilt without gloves, folding the quilt as  183 opposed to using rollers, more amenability to repairing damaged quilts, and easier loan procedures. As an observer of the NAMES Project expressed, ‘its fragility, its constant need for mending, tell the real truth about “material” life’ (Hawkins, 1996, p. 141). To reiterate, these practices should not be seen as inferior to museum standards, but are based on different assumptions about the purpose and ownership of the quilts. Indeed, the treatment of the Victorian quilts is more in accordance with the original intention for the quilts to be touched, to be the focal point for community building, and to travel extensively (Figure 29). As former convenor of the AAMQ, Terry Thorley, expressed, ‘[i]t’s the ability then to take the Quilt back into the community.…To use it to support safe sex education. That’s very important’ (cited in Power, 2011, p. 150). At the same time, there is value to the approach of museums. The quilts at MAAS are more likely to remain in their original physical condition. In addition, connection with communities is not the exclusive province of community-based organisations. The ‘community of practice’ through museum volunteers was involved in the accessioning process to document the quilts (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, 2013b, p. 25). Further, the regular display of the quilt in its public programmes highlights queerness for members of many other communities, with exhibitions like The 80s Are Back integrating it into wider social narratives, and its online database allowing global accessibility.   Figure 29: Block lent by Victorian Quilt Project to Bendigo Library, 01/11/16. Image courtesy of John Hall  184  The tensions that exist between community-based and institutional settings in relation to LGBTIQ diversity are based on fundamental differences that can make each wary of the other. As has been demonstrated throughout the thesis, the balance of power is often tipped in favour of museums over queer communities. Responsible for representing social diversity, museums are increasingly redressing their historical neglect in collecting and displaying queer material. Their efforts occur amid tensions and imbalances of power which played out when Sheryl and Alvie Olver asked for MAAS to return their son Daren’s panel to the Victorian Quilt Project (Figure 30).   Figure 30: Block containing the Daren Olver panel at the Victorian AIDS Council, 24/11/16  Sheryl and Alvie Olver would come to the Positive Living Centre in Melbourne for the annual display of the quilts and would lament that their son’s panel was at MAAS in Sydney. While most of the quilts with predominate links to Victoria were handed over to the Victorian Quilt Project before they were accessioned, some links only became known after they had been added to the collection; other blocks (created from eight panels) were in contention because they had links to both Sydney and Victoria. The convenor of the Victorian Quilt Project, Doris Beecher, attempted to negotiate with MAAS for its return. John Hall (2016, interview) from the VAC recounts the following exchange:   185 Doris would ring the Powerhouse Museum [the main site of MAAS] and they would end up hanging up on her because she was a nuisance. She wanted to get something back from the museum. She probably used the wrong words, wrong language, wrong approach, doesn’t matter. They’d all be running for cover.  ‘Wrong words, wrong language, wrong approach’ encapsulates the tension between the museum and community which approached the return of the Olver panel in profoundly different ways, on the one hand as a compassionate gesture towards family anguish and, on the other, as a case for deaccessioning—the formal removal of an item from a collection—which is severely regulated. Each is concerned with care for the object but the beneficiaries of that care, a family and museum audiences into the future, are different.  After the failure to secure the return of the Olver panel, John Hall from the VAC was brought on to assist with the negotiations. Recalling a meeting in Sydney, Hall (2016, interview) explained his position:  This is not a museum piece yet. I said ‘one day, I hope it will be. It’s not yet. We’ll happily hand it back to you when the epidemic is over.’ We had a meeting. They said ‘no, no, no, no, no’; they were horrified that we use them in such a way, that they weren’t in a climate controlled room, light controlled room. ‘No,’ I kept saying, ‘it’s a living document, it’s a living testimony to things lived.’  Giving the perspective of MAAS, curator Peter Cox (2015, interview) explains:  I think having the quilts in the Museum collection ensures their long-term preservation and documentation that will last. If someone wants to borrow these quilts however they have to go through normal loan request procedure.…There are pros and cons with having community-based objects like this accessioned into public collections. Therefore people have to follow certain procedures if they want to access them.  One difference between the two perspectives is the role imagined for museums. Hall suggests that museums are places that consign objects to the past, whereas objects within  186 their community of origin have a vitality which is lost through ‘museumification,’ where objects are ‘in the process of dying…ow[ing] their preservation more to historical respect than to the needs of the present’ (Adorno, 1967, p. 175). Cox through his career has been conscious of the need to make museums relevant to communities (section 4.3). The aspiration of advocates of social inclusion is that they can have contemporary relevance and maintain active relationships with source communities. There are distinct differences between the approaches of museums and communities to objects like the AIDS quilts. However, both community-oriented museums and queer communities share the common goal of valuing LGBTIQ heritage.  Recognising the contributions of each to the care and interpretation of the quilts requires sustained, difficult conversations. Similar to cases of return of cultural property, engaging with communities requires that they be empowered to make decisions about their own heritage.45 For example, the founder of the NAMES Project, Cleve Jones (2000), recounted how the parents and makers of a panel asked for it to be returned ‘to set my son free.’ The organisers were hesitant but eventually agreed to cut the panel out, replacing it with a panel of the same design (pp. 182–183). In other cases, however, engaging with communities and being open to the possibility of return may lead to other positive outcomes. After the Lesbian Herstory Archives, New York, received the papers of a lesbian activist, a woman whose correspondence was included in the collection demanded that the whole collection be destroyed. After several months of discussion, she came to recognise the value of preserving the collection but still requested that her own letters be destroyed. In continuing the dialogue about the value of her records, the woman eventually responded ‘Yes. I see                                                 45 The return of cultural property, also known as ‘repatriation,’ involves the handing back of objects to source communities or remaining custodians (not owners) of those items on the premise that they belong to the source communities. It recognises the right to self-determination as outlined in the current policy of Museums Australia (2005) governing relationships between museums and Indigenous people, Continuous Cultures, Ongoing Responsibilities: ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the right to self-determination, particularly in respect of cultural heritage matters’ (p. 13). Here, ongoing relationships are weighted over the development of collections. In some cases, repatriated objects are stored in Keeping Places, ‘Aboriginal community managed places for the safekeeping of repatriated cultural material’ (Museums & Galleries of NSW, 2011, p. 6).  187 your point. Keep them safe from harm, including the harm I might do them’ (Schwarz, 1992, p. 188). When museums engage with queer communities intending a set outcome or with notions of superiority—that objects will not be returned, that they are a better place to preserve cultural heritage—the mistrust between each continues which, unfortunately, was the outcome regarding the Daren Olver panel. While it was eventually transferred to the care of the Victorian Quilt Project, it took years of negotiations and has resulted in ongoing strained relations (Brown, 2015). Instead of leading to an ongoing relationship, the status quo of mistrust has persisted.  In spite of decades of well-meaning attempts of museums to engage with communities, tensions still remain. It follows from different ideas that each has about their mission, contemporary relevance, and use of material culture. Neither is a better place for queer cultural heritage: communities and the QCHOs they have created are adept at managing their own material culture; and museums can make unique contributions to the task. Overcoming the situation of mistrust and imbalance of power is an intractable challenge but one that must be attempted again and again to be overcome. The final section continues to look at some of the difficulties of equitable collaboration.  7.4 Contact zones and constraints  The idea that museums can address their problematic relationships with communities and become a ‘contact zone’ has been widely adopted in museum studies. The way that it has been deployed, however, has arguably not shared the authority of museums to the degree promised (Frisch, 1990). In this section, the success of the exhibition Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney (8 February–31 March 2001) in creating a contact zone across the following areas will be evaluated: Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations; the inner and outer city; communities and museum / academic authorities; in the co-productive process; and diversity between and within communities. Across the divides, equitable and critical contact relations are possible, but it requires working with and against persistent constraints.  Cultural critic Mary Louise Pratt (1992) described the notion of the ‘contact zone’ as ‘the space of colonial encounters, the space…[to] establish ongoing relations, usually involving  188 conditions of coercion, radical inequality, and intractable conflict’ (pp. 6–7). The concept was adapted into the museum context by the historian and anthropologist James Clifford (1999) in the influential essay ‘Museums as Contact Zones.’ He investigated possibilities for museums to renegotiate their relations with Indigenous and colonised groups based on equitable relationships rather than domination. In doing so, following a centre-periphery metaphor, museums cannot maintain their privileged position in understandings of cultural heritage. Rather, a push-pull exchange is established where ‘[n]either community “experience” nor curatorial “authority” has an automatic right to the contextualization of collections or to the narration of contact histories’ (p. 449).  The contact zone has been used within museum discourse to express the desire for more equitable relations, not only in Indigenous relations and postcolonial settings, but with community groups generally. Indeed, in the previous section, the argument that neither community-based nor institutional settings are ‘better’ custodians of queer objects aligns with Clifford’s argument for ongoing negotiations between distrustful parties. However, there have been criticisms of how the contact zone has been deployed by museums in ways that downplay conditions of ‘coercion, radical inequality, and intractable conflict.’ The effect is that museums maintain primary authority over cultural heritage. Curator and information scientist Robin Boast (2011) argues that warnings about the inherent asymmetry of the contact zone have been largely sidelined in its application to museums. In failing to address deep assumptions and practices—for example, assuming ultimate authority over objects—the contact zone remains a site ‘in and for the center’ (p. 67). In now applying the idea of the contact zone to Edges, its inherent constraints will remain at the forefront of the analysis.  The exhibition Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney opened at the Liverpool Regional Museum (LRM) in 2001, 32 kilometres from the Sydney central business district (Figure 31). Co-curated by the LRM curator Ricardo Peach and academic Sharon Chalmers from Western Sydney University (then the University of Western Sydney), the exhibition combined 20 oral histories, photography, costumes, and videos to represent the region’s LGBTIQ community; an events programme including a community forum and film festival also took place. Both curators explicitly drew upon the concept of the ‘contact zone’ in reflecting on the collaborative process as well as the resistance  189 encountered. Chalmers (2007) recounts that she aimed to produce an ‘“interdiscursive contact zone” where [participants’] different experiences, values and knowledges could be explored within a traditionally elite context’ (p. 136). She recalls resistance to exploring hidden histories from a member of the ‘Friends of the Museum’ who thought that the exhibition ‘belittled, demeaned and trivialised…“their” area’s “authentic” colonial past’ (ibid.). Peach (2005) when citing the creation of a contact zone was conscious of Clifford’s qualification that the borders are ‘never free and routinely blocked by budgets and curatorial control, restrictive definitions of culture, by community hostility and miscomprehension’ (p. 6).   Figure 31: Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney (8 February–31 March 2001). Image courtesy of Liverpool City Council.  The area that the museum represents, South Western Sydney, covers the traditional land of the Darug, Tharawal, and Gandangara Aboriginal people. Its history of frontier violence and dispossession—including the Appin Massacre of 14 Aboriginal men, women, and children in the area (Keating, 1996, pp. 17–19)—means that it is a contact zone in its original, colonial sense. Since opening in 1989 as the Liverpool Bicentennial Museum, the museum has sought to acknowledge the traditional owners, though it has not covered the  190 darker aspects of settler colonial history.46 For example, its first exhibition Too Dark for the Light Horse—a travelling exhibit from the Australian War Memorial—presented the experiences of Aboriginal people in the Light Horse Brigade during WWI and WWII (“Bicentennial Museum Open,” 1989, p. 7). Inclusion here arguably reinforces nationalist narratives rather than unsettling them. Such selective representation was also revealed in a significance assessment of the LRM’s collection which noted that ‘[o]bvious gaps are the lack of indigenous items as well as items from the very broad immigrant community’ (Coote & Marshall, 2010, p. 9). The museum is ideally located to be a contact zone with Indigenous communities but engagements have been insubstantial so far.  As also noted by the significance assessment, the location of the museum in a multicultural, suburban region of Sydney gives it the responsibility to reflect ‘the very broad immigrant community.’ 40% of residents were born overseas compared with 34% across Sydney, representing 150 countries of birth (Liverpool City Council, 2017). Clifford (1999), extending upon previous understandings of the contact zone existing between imperial centres and colonies, noted that they could be broadened ‘to include cultural relations within the same state, region, or city’ (p. 445). Liverpool since its founding by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810—who gave the order leading to the aforementioned Appin Massacre in the area—has been conscious of its position at the physical and symbolic periphery of central Sydney. According to historian Christopher Keating (1996), ‘[i]t has been consciously defined as a sort of frontier, a staging post between what mattered and what didn’t’ (p. 215).  The marginalisation continues today where ‘westies’ has become a derogatory term connoting ethnic otherness, dreary suburbia, unruly public housing, and welfare dependence (Gwyther, 2008, pp. 58–60). LGBTIQ communities in the area must deal with additional inaccurate stereotypes. Cultural geographer Stephen Hodge (1995b) claims that                                                 46  The Appin Massacre was the subject of the exhibition With Secrecy & Despatch at the Campbelltown Arts Centre, Sydney, in 2016. It invited six Indigenous Australian artists and four First Nations Canadian artists to reflect on the incident through their art practice. One reviewer commented that the exhibition and others in the ‘massacre genre’ suggest ‘a growing struggle to wrest national identity from the myth of white Australia’ (McLean, 2016). The exhibition won the 2017 ICOM Australia Award (ICOM Australia, 2017).  191 ‘[t]here seems to be some incredulity from inner city lesbians and gay men that there are “out” gay men and lesbians “out” there in the suburbs’ (p. 41), or that it would be a desirable or safe place to live. These simplistic views inform LGBTIQ residents’ own understanding of the area as an oral history featured in Edges conveys: ‘If we want to have the freedom that city people have it’s up to us to get out there and not put ourselves on display but to feel freer with ourselves to be ourselves’ (Liverpool Regional Museum & Chalmers, 2001, p. 18). The exhibition was a salutary statement of presence and regional pride in an area that continues to be impacted by negative perceptions.  The early 2000s when Edges opened saw other concerted efforts by the LRM to celebrate the area’s diversity with exhibitions including Sampot and Padaan: Traditional Cambodian Costume and Religious Panels opening in 2000, Leaving the Crocodile: The Story of the East Timorese Community in Sydney opening in 2001, and Aunty Nance on a prominent member of the Liverpool Koori community opening in 2002. Ricardo Peach (2005), curator at the LRM from 2000 till 2003, reflects that the museum sought to expand the narratives it told. To do so, it ‘[focused] on particular groups on a community-by-community basis’ (p. 10). The museum’s attempts to engage with Indigenous and multicultural diversity extended to consider LGBTIQ diversity through mounting Edges. While sex, gender, and sexual diversity may be briefly acknowledged by museums, often a more limited conception focusing on ethnicity and nationality is seen in operation (Davison, 2011, p. 158).  Although the co-curators express an awareness of the constraints that attend contact zones, recognition alone does not remove them. As postcolonial, feminist, and queer theorist Sara Ahmed (2004) argues, recognising one’s privilege does not discharge it. Indeed, the recognition of privilege in academic discourse can become a form of privilege in itself (para. 58). In a context of representation rather than self-representation of queer communities, a divide existed between the community and the institutionalised positions of the co-curators. Chalmers (2007) recalls that when explaining the proposed project to a local lesbian group, she ‘came with a post-modern title…“In-difference at the Edges.” Standing at a whiteboard, attempting to deconstruct the title for the women in front of me I was met with a sea of blank faces’ (p. 135). A barrier was created by academic discourse including through the later use of the ‘contact zone’ concept. Returning to Boast’s (2011)  192 critique of its use, he argues that ‘[b]y placing the contact zone in the academy, as it always is…we see how dialogue and collaboration are foregrounded, but the ultimate suppression of oppositional discourses is always effected’ (p. 64). Here, however, the co-curators displayed clear self-reflexivity regarding the power they exercised over the exhibition development process. Nevertheless, it highlights the danger of academics and museums ‘co-opt[ing] LGBT culture as a way to seem more radical than they really are’ (Steorn, 2010, p. 136).  Recognising privilege should extend to taking measures to displace it, particularly through the empowerment of communities. More than simply a checkbox, the range of approaches could be placed on the ‘ladder of citizenship participation’ from ‘(1) Manipulation and (2) Therapy…(3) Informing and (4) Consultation…(5) Placation…(6) Partnership…(7) Delegated Power and (8) Citizen Control’ (Arnstein, 1969, p. 217, emphasis in original). Most engagements between museums and queer communities are forms of consultation in providing content, objects, and feedback for museum staff to incorporate; the co-production of Edges was a form of partnership; and community galleries and QCHOs are forms of citizen control. The scale of involvement extends to different areas of exhibition development with community groups ‘frequently involved in particular elements of the process and apparently absent from others’ (Davies, 2010, p. 305). Whether an exhibition is collaborative is more than a simple affirmative or negative claim.  In the early 2000s, the LRM produced a series of exhibitions using ‘curatoriums’ consisting of ‘community members, participants and key stakeholders’ (Peach, 2005, p. 9). They were initiated not only to involve groups ‘historically marginalized because of issues such as gender, religion, sexuality, race, ethnicity, disability or class’ (p. 3) but also because the museum lacked material relating to these communities (p. 9). The curatorium process is well documented for the exhibition Leaving the Crocodile: The Story of the East Timorese Community in Sydney which opened at the LRM in 2001. Art workshops with East Timorese people under 25, and a curatorium which consulted ‘on the shape and content of the entire exhibition,’ were used to produce an exhibition on East Timorese people in Liverpool, their migration from the 1970s, and their activism around East Timorese independence (Liverpool Regional Museum, 2001, pp. 5–6). The exhibition avoided ‘speaking for’ the community but sought to ‘empower East Timorese people living in  193 western Sydney to tell their own history, their own tale’ (p. 5). For the collaboration, ‘discussion, creative expression, learning and process’ were as important as the end product (ibid.).  Critical analyses of the realities of collaboration in museums agree with the approach of relationship-tending, skills building, and emphasising process over product. Museum scholars Lynch and Alberti (2010) state that ‘[i]n practising radical trust, the museum may control neither the product nor the process’ (p. 15), a position they held after analysing the exhibition Revealing Histories: Myths about Race. Acknowledging the well-meaning attempt of the Manchester Museum, UK, to reach consensus and compromise, the authors wonder, ‘did the process bear traces of institutional racism?’ (p. 27; emphasis in original). Similar questions can be asked of the curatorium process used to produce Edges even though that degree of collaboration remains exceptional among museums. Who had ultimate authority? What were the participants’ views on the encounter? Did the balancing act accord weight to each stakeholder equitably? Peach and Chalmers are more deliberative than most curators on their collaborative process, and they attempted to inform their inclusive practice through the idea of the contact zone. Yet, as conveyed in the invitation sent to community members and groups, participation in Edges was restricted to ‘being photographed as part of the exhibition, offering ephemera that may be displayed, or taking part in group and / or individual interviews’ (Chalmers & Peach, 2000, p. 1). In maintaining much of the decision-making power around the exhibition, Peach and Chalmers exercised the traditional authority of curators who are presumed to be ‘scholar[s], expert[s] on the collections and knowledgeable about the relevant discipline’ (Hooper-Greenhill, 2000, p. 133). Arguably, the museum and academy continued to be privileged and, therefore, the exhibition was a project ‘in and for the center’ (Boast, 2011, p. 67). Similar enquiries surrounding the process used to develop Edges can be asked of its content including its presentation of diversity between and within communities.  Peach (2005) states that Edges was developed on the premise of creating ‘intercultural common ground’ (p. 22) involving negotiating borders between different communities, cultures, and identities. While the community-by-community approach of the LRM in the early 2000s might lead to the critique that the museum was segregating forms of diversity, as argued previously, queer exhibitions do not necessarily lead to uncritical and insular  194 representations (section 7.1). The assertion is supported by the strong visitor figures for the museum during that time: 754 in January, increasing to 1,160 in February (when the exhibition opened), and 1,260 during March (Ozacardi, 2017). Focusing on marginalised voices in museums is helpful in establishing dialogue with more prominent voices, dialogue that was made visible through the production of a ‘quilt’ incorporating visitor comments (Figure 32). Intercultural work in museums opens the possibility of a ‘bi-directional, dialogical process which is transformative of all parties’ (Bodo, 2012, p. 184), the potential that attracted the Institute for Culture and Society (then the Institute for Cultural Research) at Western Sydney University to partner with the museum to produce exhibitions. Ien Ang, director of the institute during Edges, explains the dilemma of intercultural work in the context of multiculturalism:  The challenge, I believe, is to recognise that the national historical record consists of divergent, unequal but intertwining histories. These intersecting strands of history can never be smoothed into a single national narrative but they nevertheless produce a common symbolic field of interrelated experiences, stories and memories – which we can call our collective heritage (Ang, 2002, p. 8).   195  Figure 32: Quilt created from visitor comments on Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney (8 February–31 March 2001). Image taken by Silversalt Photography, provided courtesy of Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre  Queer inclusion in museums intertwines queer history into the patchwork of Australia’s collective heritage. In drawing attention to the differences that constitute social diversity, it also encourages the recognition of what could be called ‘intracultural’ diversity: the differences within differences (previously discussed in section 6.2.6 ‘Diversity’). Edges used the suburban and multicultural location of the LRM to explore ‘the boundaries and margins of place and identity…[and] the marginality of hybrid identities including sexuality, “race,” ethnicity and class’ (Chalmers, 2007, p. 134). To do so, it highlighted the experiences of those who lived at the intersection of multiple identities including ‘Penny’ whose Greek heritage presented additional difficulties when coming out, LGBTIQ members of the Metropolitan Community Church, and ‘Maggie,’ a lesbian Aboriginal woman who ‘live[s] in two communities…my aboriginal community and…my homosexual community’ (Liverpool Regional Museum & Chalmers, 2001, pp. 10–18). Edges is  196 anomalous in successfully exploring the internal complexity of its subjects, and inviting audiences to identify points of contact and shared experience.  The exhibition Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney illustrated different aspects of engagements across the ‘contact zone,’ which was explicitly cited by the co-curators as a framework that informed their work. As discussed in this section, the exhibition grappled with the often fraught relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous positions; inner and outer city residents; communities and the museum / academic authorities; museums and their co-creators; and those within and outside diverse communities. Through engaging in critically reflective practice, they temporarily interrupted the divides and provided a case study for future iteration. Contact zones are affected by historically accumulated constraints but Edges shows that there is still room for equitable, inclusive museum work.  7.5 Conclusion  There is often a disconnect between Western academic theory and practice that exist in the realm of the abstract, and…real-life emancipatory struggles.…[A]t the first sign of trouble, institutions like museums run away from the fight (Lynch, 2011, p. 159).  To date, there have been more points of disconnection between Australian museums and queer communities than connection. The examples in this chapter were taken from across museum organisations in their educational, collecting, and exhibiting functions. They show that relations are often characterised by mistrust, mutual misunderstanding, and inequality. For queer communities, these issues partly stem from the challenges that museums have encountered when engaging with communities generally. Queer communities, in addition, bring their own particular lived histories of exclusion, invisibility, and marginalisation. The difficulties of including LGBTIQ diversity have led many well-meaning museums to ‘run away from the fight.’ Understandably, museums are wary of controversy, attracting unwanted attention from funding bodies, and losing control over their processes and content. However, overcoming these fears, as some individuals and museums discussed throughout the thesis have done, will increase their relevance for queer communities. They  197 have catered to the identity-related needs of queer audiences, resisted pressure to avoid controversy, worked with communities on their own terms, and confronted the numerous constraints against inclusive and equitable practice. Encouraging such orientations may assist in building lasting connections between museums, audiences, and queer communities. This aim and others are revisited in the concluding chapter that draws together the arguments and implications of Queering Australian Museums.   198 8 Conclusion: Queering Australian museums   Figure 33: Q by David McDiarmid above the Art Gallery of NSW for Australian Perspecta 1995 (3 February–26 March 1995). Image courtesy of Sally Gray and the David McDiarmid Estate  The ‘Q’ on the tympanum of the Art Gallery of New South Wales as part of Australian Perspecta 1995 symbolically queered the institution, if only temporarily (Figure 33). In addressing the problem of how queer or LGBTIQ communities can be further included in Australian museums on their own terms, the thesis has explored how fleeting interventions can become more common, more lasting, and deeper. It entailed looking across four key areas of theory and practice—management, collections, exhibitions, and connections—to identify barriers and enablers of equitable inclusion. This chapter gathers the findings of the thesis and outlines its contribution to (queer) museum studies. Its limitations will then form the basis of suggestions for future research.   199 The status quo in museums for queer communities—one characterised by heteronormativity, invisibility, and lack of diversity—will be recounted first. Shifting it has required the empowerment of queer communities in relation to museums, especially through their collaborations. While this has also necessitated queer individuals and allies to drive initiatives, establishing structures, and political support have been crucial to proliferating inclusive practices. There are significant barriers, not least the ongoing tension between museums and communities in general, and with queer communities in particular. With these factors in mind, the chapter will muse on the amenability of museums to change, and the agency that change-makers can exert within them. The findings show that the project is integrally tied to the broader re-orientation of museums towards their communities, both in Australia and internationally. The project thus contributes to the vision that museums can be vibrant, inclusive, and diverse spaces. In continually embedding the findings into practice, the ‘Q’ above can become not only a symbolic gesture outside the museum but a sign denoting equitable relationships throughout it.  8.1 Summary and implications  Heteronormativity draws attention to the innumerable ways in which heterosexuality has been privileged through social attitudes and institutions. Some of its effects were outlined in the ‘invisible knapsack’ of heterosexual privilege (see Figure 2, pp. 3–5). Within museums in Australia, it has led to the general invisibility of the vast field of LGBTIQ diversity, forming the background and justification for the thesis. In museum management, consideration of queerness has been absent among the informal and formal factors that influence decisions: LGBTIQ diversity was a low priority if considered at all, and policies such as the Gay & Lesbian Policy Guidelines for Museum Programs and Practice (GLP) have had no discernible impact. In collections, queerness was invisible due to relevant material being destroyed, hidden, or collected in an unsystematic manner. Queer interpretations have also been impacted by the assumption of heterosexuality, as seen in criticisms of the Victorian Material Survey (section 5.4.1). Considerable evidence was given for forces within and outside the museum that encourage the reproduction of the status quo.   200 Where queerness is made visible, it often uncovers discriminatory attitudes and leads to controversy. Many museums have avoided broaching queer subjects because of the perceived and actual threat of controversy, or because of the outmoded notion that museums can and should be apolitical (section 7.2). Double standards apply, however, that result in non-heterosexual intimacies being deemed inappropriate even if not sexually explicit. They apply especially when material might be available to children, drawing on inaccurate associations with abnormality and child abuse. This led to conflict around the exhibitions Prejudice and Pride (1994), Robert Mapplethorpe Retrospective (1995), and Forbidden Love – Bold Passion (1996) to name just three. Rather than avoiding controversy, organisations like the Migration Museum, Adelaide, have a history of preparing for it, and using moments of conflict to mediate social dialogue. In challenging queer invisibility, this orientation placed pressure on heteronormative conventions and helped to push the limits of acceptance.  There has been increasing space available to highlight these exclusions, nonetheless. In 2017, same-sex marriage was legalised which—in a limited way—drew attention to the general inequality of non-heterosexuals in Australian society. 47  In museums, too, continuing attempts to re-orient museums towards diverse communities have supported calls for further queer inclusion. The last ten years, as indicated in the review of queer museological literature of which the current research is part, have seen an intensification of interest in the area. However, increasing financial constraints place pressure on socially relevant and queer-inclusive work. The negative impact of efficiency dividends, and the failure to incorporate non-utilitarian considerations in evaluating museums, hamper initiatives that primarily contribute social value. The State of Victoria signalled that the trend is not inevitable through its increased investment in arts and culture generally, and support of queer community organisations such as the forthcoming Victorian Pride Centre (Premier of Victoria, 2016).                                                  47 Prior to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in 2017, the federal Marriage Act defined marriage as ‘the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others’ (Parliament of Australia, 2004). Other LGBTIQ rights issues continue including the criminalisation of homosexuality internationally, the plight of LGBTIQ asylum seekers, discrimination in education, inequities in family law, and LGBTIQ domestic violence (Tran, 2015).  201 Despite outward concerns with diversity, Australian museums have largely excluded sex, gender, and sexual diversity. The pressure to measure the impact of museums did not result in the collection of demographic information that could assess queer inclusion; there have also been backward steps in terms of national data collection and national cultural policies, reflecting the instrumental perspective through which museums are increasingly viewed. Throughout the research, people in queer communities were included primarily as citizens rather than members of their communities. Furthermore, when representation has occurred, other diversity issues were discerned. Representations are concentrated around LGBTIQ festivals and have tended to favour the spectacular and scandalous over the everyday. In addition, from a review of the queer exhibitions that have opened in Australia to date, it was found that the absence of diversity beyond gay male (and to a slightly lesser extent, lesbian) experience was an acute concern. The experiences of transgender, minority ethnic, disabled, Indigenous, and non-metropolitan queer people were given even less room. When acknowledged, they often occurred tokenistically in displays that purported to represent a singular community.   Given that norms leading to consistent queer inclusion have not been established within museums, LGBTIQ individuals and allies within the museum sector have been key to driving initiatives. They have exhibited leadership by encouraging museum organisations to adopt inclusive practices. It is unlikely that Prejudice and Pride at the Museum of Brisbane would have occurred without LGBTIQ individuals at the museum and among the local councillors. However, allies like Des Griffin have pursued queer inclusion as part of a broader mission of social justice. Importantly, in his capacity as director of the Australian Museum, he established structures and policies that encouraged inclusion work beyond individual influences. Such examples point to the need to involve both LGBTIQ-identified and non-identified advocates to share the responsibility of diversifying museums. Establishing networking forums within professional associations and at individual museums has proven effective overseas at highlighting LGBTIQ issues, measures that could be easily pursued in the Australian context.  The often-stated goal of engagement between museums and queer communities is equitable collaboration with, and empowerment of, the latter. The thesis has established, however, that realisation of this has proven difficult for museums as they must balance numerous  202 pragmatic concerns and may be unwilling to relinquish ultimate authority and control to ‘outsiders.’ The History Trust of South Australia stood out in terms of its social justice and inclusion work going back to the early 1980s, starting with the Constitutional Museum and then the Migration Museum. Notably, the first public LGBTIQ exhibition in Australia opened in its community gallery (also the first of its kind in Australia) in 1982. In 2016, the museum opened the first public museum exhibition in Australia focusing on queer youth, OUT at the Museum: Queer Youth of SA, also within a community gallery. While the degree of co-production it achieved cannot be used for all exhibitions, it illustrated a level of collaboration and trust that is not forthcoming in many museums.  For queer communities—as with other communities in relation to museums generally—control over their representations is evidently of central importance: community-run media are still essential to broadcasting issues of concern that would otherwise be ignored or misrepresented, and unwanted disclosure of one’s sexuality can still bring about disastrous consequences. Therefore, sensitivity to the need for privacy and control is the pre-condition for ongoing research and collaborations in the area. The self-determination that queer communities have exercised in relation to their identities, cultures, and heritage, particularly since the 1970s, will likely continue when (and if) they work with museums. The productive relationships between museums and community groups suggested in ‘Chapter 7: Queering connections’ all involve the latter being central, if not primary, authorities in decisions over LGBTIQ heritage and representations.  Due to the above desire for control and the history of ambivalence towards public institutions, queer communities since the 1970s alongside other groups have built their own cultural infrastructure. Restating the central problem of the enquiry—how queer or LGBTIQ communities can be further included in Australian museums on their own terms—various community organisations have decided that their goals are better met by remaining independent. Among the queer community heritage organisations (QCHOs), the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives is the most significant, surpassing any public institution in its sustained collecting and exhibiting of LGBTIQ historical material. The achievements of QCHOs question the notion that public museums are necessarily the best place for the preservation of heritage. Indeed, the involvement of QCHOs with festivals and flexibly sited exhibition programmes present models that could be followed by public  203 institutions. Moreover, the innovative ways in which they appropriated gallery / library / archive / museum (GLAM) conventions through pop-up and online projects might also assist museums in looking beyond their traditional boundaries (section 5.6). Community organisations perform the essential function of producing representations by and for communities. While QCHOs received criticism for supposedly encouraging separatism, ALGA through its contributions towards public museum exhibitions showed that community-run sites could form the basis of broader social engagement.   Empowering queer communities—along the lines of deliberations between museums and Indigenous and colonised groups particularly—requires that museums relinquish their sole authority. It was argued that well-intentioned attempts by museums to engage come with the right of communities to disengage. That is, only from the starting point of co-existence between museum and community organisations can equitable collaboration follow. However, instances where dialogue has broken down are common. Instead of the negotiation of the return of the Daren Olver quilt panel becoming a celebratory moment of connection, the different orientations of museums and communities to material culture led to ongoing mistrust and misunderstanding (section 7.3). In contrast, the collaboration between a community organisation and cultural institutions to produce Prejudice and Pride at the Museum of Brisbane—the largest state-based queer exhibition to date—demonstrated that equitable partnerships are possible. Further, Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney showed that collaborations could occur amid historically conditioned constraints. In drawing upon the notion of the museum as a ‘contact zone,’ the curators were able to work with and against these constraints to produce an exhibition that was uniquely attuned to the internal diversity of the area. In such instances of equitable collaboration, the unique contributions of both museums and communities are harnessed.  The empowerment of queer communities does not have to diminish the role of public museums. As public institutions, they have the substantial ability to bring issues to general attention and to include groups within broad social narratives. Exhibitions on HIV/AIDS showed that museums could have positive effects on contemporary social, medical, and political discourses (section 6.2.5). Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS, in particular, which opened at the National Gallery of Australia in 1994, is unequalled in its impact among public museum interventions. As of 2017, it remained the only LGBTIQ  204 exhibition to have opened at the national level in Australia. It counteracted the idea that museums should stay out of the political realm and, in being open to younger people, challenged the notion that they should not be ‘exposed’ to queerness. In addition, it far exceeded expected visitor numbers and engaged audiences who had not viewed the institution as relevant to them. It palpably demonstrated that queer programming does not have to have a narrow appeal (section 6.2.3).  Public museums have an important role to play in facilitating the acceptance and celebration of queerness as an integral part of social diversity, for instance under common themes such as love and family (Figure 34). At the same time, other formats like community-focused exhibitions and festival programming that emphasise either the sameness or difference of queerness are equally valid (sections 6.2.2 to 6.2.4). The difficult problem that museums face is how they can accommodate the cultural and political goals of queer communities while not resorting to the hierarchical ways of operating to which they have become accustomed. It will often mean taking cues from these communities—e.g. if they wish objects to be returned (section 7.3); if collecting oral history evidence is important to them (section 5.5)—instead of the other way around. The thesis, in identifying cases of best practice and instructive moments of disconnection, espoused the benefits of ongoing negotiation between museums and communities.   205  Figure 34: Wedding tuxedos of high-profile gay couple Tim Campbell and Anthony Callea in Love Is: Australian Wedding Fashion (13 May 2017–22 April 2018), Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. Image courtesy of Chiara O’Reilly  Building the trust to further include queerness in museums takes time and may require a history of sustained, equitable collaboration. Nevertheless, the majority of projects discussed for the thesis were one-offs. Mostly driven by the endeavours of a small group of LGBTIQ people and allies, queer inclusion often dissolved when they moved on. Timing activities during festivals has become a prominent way of introducing relevant programming, but even these efforts have not been sustained year-to-year. A relatively easy opportunity for museums is to participate in festivals on a regular basis. Of course, they are subject to the critique of encouraging temporary as opposed to permanent interventions (section 6.2.4). However, temporary interventions that occur annually still represent a greater degree of queer inclusion than at present. In any case, transient initiatives are not sufficient: queerness could be integrated into permanent exhibitions as at the Melbourne Museum and the Newcastle Museum; and efforts could be coordinated nationally by  206 Museums Galleries Australia, starting with an overdue review of the Gay & Lesbian Policy Guidelines for Museum Programs and Practice.  The pastiche of exceptional but unsustained projects calls into question the degree of change possible within museums. However, agents of queer inclusion interviewed for this thesis were conscious of the constraints within which museums are enmeshed (Appendix A). From the first public LGBTIQ exhibition in 1982, queer communities have strategically utilised public institutions to insert themselves into and thereby expand notions of ‘the public.’ Curator Nikki Sullivan (2016, interview) reworks the feminist pronouncement that ‘the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house’ to envision ‘radically transform[ing] the museum…[although] always having to compromise.’ While communities should remain alert to the power relations of compromise—with communities often bearing its brunt—case studies in the thesis suggested that museums are capable of significant change through their engagements. Queer communities used the language and processes of museums strategically to apply any malleability towards their own ends. Occasionally, as at the Migration Museum during the discussed projects, their willingness to engage was returned, and such moments illustrated changes that could be encouraged in museums writ large (sections 6.2.2 and 7.2). While the right of queer communities and QCHOs to disengage from public museums has been maintained, it is balanced against the benefits of engagement.  Critiques in the later part of the twentieth century have expanded the capacity of museums to incorporate multiple meanings. Queer interventions in museums often aim to reform rather than discard previous practices. The case was made that queering collections involved working with and against existing conventions (Chapter 5). Queer readings thus used existing collections as a resource, but overlayed new meanings upon them. They offer great potential to identify relevant material in existing collections and develop LGBTIQ collections (section 5.4), as well as to highlight queer connections through tours (section 7.1). The collection of oral histories also participates in the expansion of museum collections in immaterial dimensions. In Chapter 6, it was argued that instead of supplanting existing approaches to queer exhibitions, additional exhibitions responding to critiques could be mounted: more public exhibitions alongside community-based ones; integrative and identity-specific; commonly represented topics and marginal topics. Such  207 reasoning favoured a both / and approach that acknowledged the inclusion work that happened previously, but also recognised that constant critical evaluation was required. It also proceeded from the idea that communities would be empowered to navigate the multiple (and often contradictory) effects of their decisions instead of following prescribed models. Across the thesis, it was suggested that queering Australian museums involves critically iterating on existing museum conventions while remaining aware of their limitations. It is an inherently experimental exercise that requires a considerable degree of risk-taking, though one where ‘failures’ might be generative.  Museums in Australia are at the nexus of many challenges surrounding difference. They are located in a settler colonial society with a turbulent history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations. Ongoing conflict has played out in museums through the ‘history wars’ that saw the federal government intervene against so-called ‘black armband’ history at the National Museum of Australia (section 2.2 ‘New museology’). It is often proclaimed by Australian governments that Australia is the most successful multicultural nation, but the assertion is debatably not reflected in its major cultural institutions. Yet, despite myriad challenges, Australian museums have displayed practices commendable on the world stage. They have made meaningful strides towards Indigenous / non-Indigenous reconciliation through recognition of self-determination on cultural matters, and through continued repatriation of ancestral remains and secret / sacred objects. Museums run by the History Trust of South Australia have consistently displayed leading practices: the former Constitutional Museum mounted Becoming Visible: Lesbians & Male Homosexuals – From Oppression to Liberation in 1982 that predated similar exhibitions in the USA and UK by over a decade; and the Migration Museum established in 1986 was a world first, and it continues to mount provocative exhibitions like OUT at the Museum: Queer Youth of SA in 2016. Australia had an arguably world-leading, bipartisan response to the AIDS Crisis, enabling Don’t Leave Me This Way: Art in the Age of AIDS to open in 1994, the first exhibition of its kind at a national gallery. In 1999, Museums Australia developed the first policy statement on LGBTIQ issues at a national museum body level, the GLP, and established a formal alliance of museum professionals to carry out its aims. Finally, the Victorian Material Survey conducted between 2005 and 2006 remains one of the few cross-collection surveys of LGBTIQ material worldwide (section 5.4). All these efforts reveal  208 that despite manifold constraints and challenges, Australian museums can undertake best practice on social and queer inclusion.  Distilling the above overview into barriers and enablers belies the difficulty of increasing queer inclusion. For one, factors that could be considered barriers also enabled valuable outcomes, for example, the withdrawal of queer communities from public institutions leading to rich community-based programming. Furthermore, these factors cannot be addressed independently and definitively, but require entering into complex, ongoing, and sometimes unpredictable negotiations. With such qualifications in mind, Figure 35 draws together the threads of the project and maps out the broad factors that assist and inhibit the queering of museums. 48  Barriers Queering museums Enablers Heteronormativity / assumption of heterosexuality è  ç Community empowerment / collaboration / co-production  Lack of collections / history of engagement è ç Amenable policies / political environment Negative perceptions of museums è  ç Networking opportunities including queer allies Resistance to change è  ç Research on (queer) inclusion and diversity Claiming objectivity or apoliticism è  ç Leadership Fear of controversy è  ç Accommodating multiple narratives Financial constraints è  ç Mediating conflict Lack of (queer) audience studies è  ç Pursuing contemporary relevance Disconnected ‘silos’ of practice è  ç History of sustained, inclusive practice Lack of representations of internal è  ç Support of self-determination /                                                 48 This model is adapted from ‘Social Inclusion, the Museum and the Dynamics of Sectoral Change’ which charts ‘forces for change’ against ‘change inhibitors’ toward museums being agents of social inclusion (Sandell, 2003, p. 51).  209 diversity QCHOs Not sharing authority è  ç Flexibility in questioning existing conventions Attitude that sex, gender, and sexuality are private matters è  ç Strategic experimentation and risk-taking Few local case studies è ç Mutual understanding and accommodation Figure 35: Barriers and enablers of queer inclusion in museums  8.2 Limitations, future research, and contribution  The study has been limited firstly by the Anglocentric nature of the supporting literature utilised and, additionally, because the wide scope of the study has necessarily meant that many areas could not be covered in depth. The limitations, however, also suggest directions for future research. On the first, works in queer museology primarily cite examples from a limited range of national and linguistic contexts, particularly the USA and the UK, with some notable exceptions.49 The limitation was partially mitigated by the availability of literature produced in European contexts with multilingual traditions including Sweden and the Netherlands, but it circumscribed access to the museological strategies used in other sociocultural contexts. Given the cultural specificity of sex, gender, and sexuality, it also restricts cross-cultural comparisons that could benefit museum representations and processes. Finally, it restricts access to primary and secondary materials relating to key sites like the Schwules Museum, Berlin, one of the few permanent LGBTIQ museums in the world (see Appendix D). Addressing the national skew in queer museology might involve multilingual researchers turning their attention to other museum environments, their associations, and international conferences (e.g. produced by national chapters of the International Council of Museums).                                                  49 Examples include Cheng (2011) who reflected on curating the first LGBTIQ exhibition to open in Taiwan, and Qu (2012) who studied the Chinese Sex Museum, ‘[p]robably the first museum in [the] Chinese mainland to include homosexuality and queer objects in its permanent displays’ (p. 45).  210 The second limitation of the enquiry comes from its broad scope, though it is also one of its contributions to (queer) museum studies. To contribute to the few studies of LGBTIQ inclusion in Australian museums, it undertook a broad national survey. In addition, it looked to multiple areas of museum theory and practice rather than focusing on any particular area, a scope that was viewed as necessary to establish the terrain of relevant projects that have occurred to date. From the outset, it was intended that future researchers would focus on particular areas that the thesis has covered, for example, utilising resources such as ‘Appendix C: Queer exhibitions in Australia, 1977–2016’ for additional investigation, or undertaking a national LGBTIQ material survey that was beyond the scope of section 5.1 ‘Where are the queer collections?’ Future research might also revisit queer-inclusive projects for which interview and archival material could not be accessed. Topics that would benefit from further study will now be discussed, including a close study of individual organisations and types of organisations, queer artist interventions in museums, queer festivals, and internal and external diversity.  The thesis has centred on museums, particularly in their representations of social history. A close analysis of individual organisations or projects would be productive. The Migration Museum and ALGA stood out in terms of their sustained advocacy on issues of social and queer inclusion. What factors have produced the leadership of the Migration Museum and how can it be replicated? Although ALGA is a community archive, it surpasses many public organisations in its commitment to preserving LGBTIQ heritage. How can museums support the work of community organisations and collaborate equitably with them? It draws further attention to the work of other GLAM sites and beyond.50 In addition to recognising that museums are only one node in the wider network of public history, looking beyond the                                                 50 Sites beyond GLAMs include those recognised by Museums & Galleries of NSW (2013). It categorised a database of 2,091 organisations into the following categories: Aboriginal sites, archive library, ARI / community gallery, arts councils and arts festivals, commercial galleries, community organisations, conservators / design / consulting firms, education, friends organisations, funding bodies, genealogical societies, government federal, government local, government state, heritage organisations, historical societies, international / consulates, keeping places / cultural centres, local community museums, media, other organisations, public galleries, public museums, museums, related organisations, religious organisations, research organisations, sponsors, state or national institutions, suppliers, tourism organisations, and youth arts (p. 7).  211 museum is necessary because queer communities have done so. QCHOs flexibly appropriate GLAM practices and the ways in which they do so could invigorate interdisciplinary museum practice. By closely studying QCHOs and collaborative projects, future research can extend beyond the institutional voices of museums that tend to amplify their own achievements. What do visitors and participants in the projects think of the process and product?  In addition to carefully examining individual organisations, other studies could look at particular types of museums—e.g. art museums, children’s museums, science and technology museums, natural history museums, and virtual museums—which may reveal distinct approaches to queer inclusion. To take natural history museums as an example, the Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo (2006), Norway, mounted the compelling exhibition Against Nature? on homosexuality among animals. How do natural history museums in Australia reinforce heterosexual narratives of progress in their representations? Other enquiries could be based around art museums. Although not immune to controversy, perhaps the framework of art museums allow for explorations of non-normative intimacies that would not be tolerated elsewhere. What potential do queer artists’ interventions offer in challenging heteronormativity?  Artists’ interventions in museums have produced novel museum experiences, often broaching difficult topics. For this reason, exhibitions like The Gay Museum have been subject to extensive commentary and have inspired further similar exhibitions in Australia (Barrett & Millner, 2014, pp. 87–91; Karkruff, 2014, p. 30; Mills, 2008, p. 49). While the academic work of the artist Matt Smith (2015) and gender theorist Ann Cvetkovich (2003) has considered the topic, much more remains to be researched in the Australian context. The gay Australian activist and academic Dennis Altman has also recognised the research gap:  There is a major study to be written of the relationship between homosexuality and art in Australia, not only through the work of significant artists but also through the influence of galleries, both public and private, and the ways in which art was often a medium for expressing ideas about sexuality and gender that subverted the existing order (Altman, 2013, p. 80).  212  In looking at how art can help change ‘hearts and minds,’ links could be made to the emerging literature on the affective and sensorial dimensions of the museum experience (Dudley, 2012b; Gregory & Witcomb, 2007; Howes, 2014; Watson, 2016; Witcomb, 2013, 2015). Such a project could also look beyond formal settings of production and display to consider the informal mediums used by queer artists including queer festivals. As discussed in section 6.2.4, they have been central to the production of queer exhibitions, and form a vital part of the cultural infrastructure that supports queer communities. Especially as the inaugural Australian LGBTI+ History Month was launched in 2016, it is a useful moment to undertake research on these formations (Minus18 et al., 2016). How can museums further utilise festivals to engage with queer communities? How can relationships be sustained throughout the year? How can non-queer audiences be drawn into programming? How can guided and self-guided tours be further used to queer institutions on an ongoing basis? The answers to the preceding questions have wider significance given that festivals often become central community meeting points (e.g. for ethnolinguistic communities).  In addition to looking at relations between museums and communities, future research could focus on marginalised intersectional locations within queer communities. Queer inclusion across the areas considered in the thesis has often been based on ‘gay and lesbian’ experience, with an emphasis on the former over the latter. Still less attention was given to other identities under the LGBTIQ umbrella, particularly transgender and intersex experiences, and those from non-metropolitan areas. Most of the case studies revolved around capital cities of eastern states and territories (Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, and Brisbane) which future projects could attempt to resist. In addition, the interaction of queerness with other forms of difference—ethnicity, disability, and indigeneity to name just three—was often set aside. Homing in on the differences within queerness could ensure that the framework of diversity and inclusion extends to all. At the same time, finding ways to represent shared experiences among these differences is another area that needs further investigation. Exhibitions like Edges: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Lives in Western Sydney were able to do so without diminishing internal differences (section 7.4). How can museums represent ‘the LGBTIQ’ community without being accused of tokenism? Why do queer community members go to museums and what prevents them from fully participating in their offerings? Exploring these issues holds the potential of not only recognising the  213 diversity within queer communities, but also establishing the crisscrossing ties that bind them with wider society.  Finally, given the importance of queer individuals and allies to relevant programming occurring, the diversity of the museum sector itself could be scrutinised. It was shown in section 4.4 ‘Employment and networking’ that there are few studies examining the diversity of museum workers in Australia which is consequential for other groups who are underrepresented in the sector including women, Indigenous Australians, ethnic minorities, and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. It is likely that approaches to internal diversity and inclusion directly impact how museums engage with external communities. The activities of community heritage organisations are produced ‘by and for’ those communities. If the lines between the museum and community are blurred, not only through temporary collaborative projects but also through representation on staff, a new degree of trust and relevance may result. Research can look at the utility of equitable staffing measures, which must first start off with studies of the diversity of the sector. How do workplace practices encourage or discourage queer visibility? What are the mechanisms that reproduce the status quo among museum workers? How can programmes like Pride in Diversity and ‘safe space’ accreditations assist in ensuring safer, more inclusive workplaces for LGBTIQ people? The thesis has addressed topics that have a bearing on these questions, but points to numerous opportunities for further research.  Queering Australian Museums: Management, Collections, Exhibitions, and Connections attended to the gap in museum studies literature on queer-inclusive projects in Australian museums compared with Euro-American locations. Through undertaking original case studies, as well as re-interpreting material already subject to academic attention, the research contributes to ongoing engagements between museums and queer communities. The case studies drew upon material from underutilised archives and interviews with 25 activists, scholars, and museum workers, providing resources for further discussion in queer museology and museum studies. Gathering perspectives from different points on the museum / community divide allowed an analysis of barriers and enablers of further connections between the two. Here, the argument was made that each has an essential role in queering museums: ‘queer community heritage organisations’ were positioned as a key stakeholder in this exercise; and, at the same time, it was demonstrated that the language  214 and conventions of museums can be used and recast by critical practitioners. Navigating both often-diverging positions, the thesis suggests interdisciplinary linkages and equitable connections that have significant practical implications. In the encounter, museums might further resonate with queer possibilities—be queered—and queer communities might attain a sense of belonging on their own terms.  215 References  Abt, J. (2006).

    "abstract": "Queering Australian Museums addresses the problem of how queer or LGBTIQ communities can be further included in Australian museums on their own terms. It looks at four areas of museums—management, collections, exhibitions, and connections with audiences and communities—to consider barriers and enablers of queer inclusion in these often heteronormative institutions. Case studies of queer-inclusive efforts in public Australian museums are interpreted from institutional and community perspectives drawn from 25 interviews. The interviews are put into critical conversation with archival material and literature from museum studies and the emerging field of queer museology.  The study evaluates the visibility of the history, cultures, and identities of queer communities in Australian museums. It establishes that many public representations of queerness have been driven by the efforts of LGBTIQ communities, particularly through community-based heritage organisations. It also gathers and reflects upon examples of critical queer inclusion that have occurred in public museums. Using these exemplars, it argues that queer communities should be empowered to make decisions about their own heritage with the support of museums and their unique attributes; that individual and organisational leadership, involving queer individuals and allies, should be brought to bear on this task; and that effectively navigating the tensions between museums and queer communities requires mutual understanding and accommodation. Through the process of queering the museum, it is suggested, each party might be transformed, leading to LGBTIQ diversity being valued as an integral part of society.  The thesis addresses the gap in Australian museum studies literature on queer or LGBTIQ inclusion compared with Euro-American settings. It further contributes original case studies to the international field of queer museology, and to museum studies literature on including and empowering diverse communities. Both recognising the agency of queer communities and also engaging with the language and conventions of museums, it constructs a distinct account of how to navigate the historical tensions between the two. It thereby aims to enrich museum offerings for all audiences on the terms of those erstwhile excluded",
