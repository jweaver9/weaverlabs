Phillips\nAbstract\nIn response to multiple youth suicides, Dan Savage and Terry Miller \nfounded a YouTube channel that later became the It Gets Better Proj-\nect (IGBP). The ever-growing corpus of IGBP videos now includes \nover 50,000 “messages of hope” targeting at-risk LGBTQ and ques-\ntioning youth. Employing Ethnographic Content Analysis (ECA) and \nthe theoretical lens of attribution, this study offers insight into how \nLGBTQ bullying and harassment are discussed in the IGBP and to \nwhat they are internally and externally attributed. Findings revealed \nexternal attributions were more prevalent than internal attributions \npertaining to types of harassment and bullying experienced as well \nas explanations of how “it gets better,” with a focus on institutions as \nboth the cause of and remedy for bullying and harassment.\nLaurie M. Phillips is an Assistant Professor of Public Relations in the School \nof Journalism & Communication at the University of Oregon. Her research \nfocuses on strategic communication and the LGBTQ communities. \nThe Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1), Spring 2013\nPage 31\ntheJSMS.org\nIn the past few years, the media have identified more than one dozen youths who have taken their own lives as a result of peer harassment and bullying, all of whom were targeted because of \nself-identification as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LG-\nBTQ), or peers’ perceptions of their sexual orientation. In response to \nthese recent suicides, relationship and sex columnist Dan Savage and \nhis husband Terry Miller created a YouTube channel on September \n15, 2010 with the intention of disseminating life-saving messages to \nat-risk LGBTQ youths (Parker-Pope, 2010). What Savage and Miller \nfounded soon became known as the “It Gets Better Project” (hence-\nforth IGBP), a YouTube-based, user-generated project for social \nchange containing strategic messages of hope from thousands of \nparticipants worldwide. \n While the use of social media for the purposes of strategic com-\nmunication is not unique (Rheingold, 2002; Shirky, 2010) nor is the \npropensity for LGBTQ individuals to use Internet-based applications \nto communicate with one another (Gross, 2003), the IGBP’s use of a \ncrowdsourced, user-generated medium to combat suicide is novel, \nand more pertinently, it offers theoretical insight into the psychologi-\ncal concept of attribution. Through an interpretive analysis of the role \nof attribution as depicted in the IGBP, this study seeks to understand \nhow LGBTQ-centric bullying and harassment are discussed and to \nwhat they are attributed. Subsequently, the following literature review \nconsists of three sections: 1) a brief overview of the IGBP; 2) an over-\nview of how the Internet, and social media specifically, has been used \nby LGBTQ-identified and allied individuals historically; and 3) what \ncan be surmised from the current corpus of LGBTQ-related suicidal-\nity research. Each section is discussed in turn.\nBackground on The It Gets Better Project \n Prompted by a reader’s comment on his Savage Love blog, Sav-\nage decided it was necessary to reach out to harassed LGBTQ youths \ndirectly to show them that life improves post-grade school (Savage \n& Miller, 2011). Realizing that young adults spend the bulk of their \ntime online (“Trend Data,” 2011), a portion of which includes both \nconsuming and producing YouTube video content (Lenhart, 2012), \nSavage decided to target at-risk LGBTQ youths through the media \nvehicles they heavily consume and in turn bypass the need for poten-\nPage 32                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\ntially socially conservative and/or homophobic school administrators’ \npermission for entrance into school assembly halls (Hubbard, 2010). \n Harnessing the power of user-generated video and crowdsourc-\ning, Savage and Miller created an 8 ½ minute testimonial discussing \ntheir experiences of overcoming peer harassment and bullying and \nsubsequently how their lives got better post-grade school. Through \nhis syndicated column, Savage Love, Savage urged LGBTQ adults \nto participate by sharing their own stories (Savage, 2010). Theoreti-\ncally, the YouTube channel would permit LGBTQ individuals of all \ndemographics to be represented, as opposed to mainstream LGBTQ \nmedia representations that historically have been stereotypical and \nextremely narrow, when visibility is afforded at all (Aslinger, 2010; \nGross, 2002; Kane et al., 2012; Sender, 2004; Streitmatter, 2009; Wal-\nters, 2003). \n Since its inception, over 50,000 videos have been created in mul-\ntiple languages, including messages from the famous and non-famous \nalike, such as celebrities, for- and non-profit organizations, interna-\ntional politicians, and everyday LGBTQ and allied folks, and videos \nhave been viewed in excess of 50 million times (“About,” 2013). The \nIGBP has experienced tremendous growth internationally as well, \nand IGBP affiliates have been developed in 12 countries: Australia, \nChile, Denmark, Italy, Jamaica, Mexico, Paraguay, Portugal, Puerto \nRico, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland (“International Affiliates,” \n2013). Alongside the IGBP’s exponential growth, the topic of LGBTQ \nyouth suicide continues to be of considerable interest to mainstream \nand niche media, further fueled by news of additional youth suicides \n(Praetorius, 2011), transforming the issue of LGBTQ youth suicide \nfrom a purely minority concern into one of both cultural and political \nsignificance and immediate importance for numerous stakeholders \nincluding parents/guardians, educators, politicians, mental health \npractitioners, and strategic communicators. Extensive mainstream \nmedia coverage and commentary of youth bullying serve as addi-\ntional evidence for this claim (Parker-Pope, 2011; Weise, 2010), as do \nIGBP inclusion within corporate advertising (Miller, 2011) and the \ncomprehensive guidelines for anti-bullying laws and policies recently \nintroduced at the state, local, and federal levels (Levy, 2013; Marra, \n2013). Despite its influence on U.S. culture and public policy, the \nIGBP has been criticized extensively by those inside and outside of \nPage 33\ntheJSMS.org\nthe LGBTQ communities for its racist, classist, sexist, and bi/trans-\nphobic claims of life automatically getting better with time as well as \nfor the project’s controversial co-founder, Savage, who tends to be \neither loved or despised (Cage, 2010; Eichler, 2010; Herrera y Lozano, \n2011; Novack, 2010; Puar, 2010; Tseng, 2010).\n In addition to the practical implications of anti-bullying infor-\nmation and suicide prevention, the IGBP has methodological and \ntheoretical implications for social media scholars. The IGBP is a \nveritable living archive of messaging dedicated to LGBTQ youths, \nand it is a distinct corpus that allows social media researchers to learn \nmore about how social media tools are actively being used for social \nchange. As a form of strategic communication, the videos present \na unique and timely opportunity to analyze user-generated content \ntargeted to – and in some instances produced by – a population that \nhas only recently been included in suicide-related research (Haas \net al., 2011). Before examining how LGBTQ-centric bullying and \nharassment are discussed and to what they are attributed, it is crucial \nto situate the IGBP within the broader context of LGBTQ individuals’ \nonline participation.\nLGBTQ Individuals’ Online Participation\n As Davies (2010) asserted, “No future mode of expression or \ncommunication can flourish without respect for, understanding of, \nand reference to the past” (p. 134). Although a complete history of \nthe LGBTQ communities’ extensive online participation is beyond \nthe scope of this study, a brief overview of LGBTQ individuals’ online \nparticipation is necessary to situate it. \n Since the mid-1980s, LGBTQ-identified Internet users and those \nengaging in same-sex behaviors, regardless of their identification, \nhave gone online to find like others for sexual purposes, platonic \nrelationships, and social support (Clift, 2010; Lazzara, 2010; Mow-\nlabocus, 2010) through Internet chat rooms and message boards \n(Drushel, 2010) and various virtual communities (Barber, 2010; \nBerger, 2010; Edwards, 2010; Gregg, 2010; Hanmer, 2010; McHarry, \n2010; Tsika, 2010; Whitesel, 2010). More broadly, LGBTQ individuals \nof all ages have used the Internet for identity development and con-\nfirmation purposes, as a way to challenge narrow mainstream media \ndepictions of the LGBTQ populations, and to put forth a “commonal-\nity of experience” with the intent of building and reinforcing com-\nPage 34                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\nmunity (Alexander & Losh, 2010; Pullen & Cooper, 2010). Because \nof the breadth and depth of LGBTQ online participation, Usher and \nMorrison (2010) declared, “An LGBT person no longer needs to es-\ncape to the world of the Castro or to Christopher Street to find people \nlike himself or herself; instead, all the LGBTQ person has to do is go \nonline” (p. 280). \n Within the expansive Internet landscape, LGBTQ individuals \nhave used social media tools for a variety of purposes. For example, \nYouTube has been utilized by LGBTQ individuals for the purposes \nof: 1) drawing attention to teens bullied to death on account of their \nsexual orientation (Pullen, 2010); 2) publicly coming out through \nvernacular video (Alexander & Losh, 2010); and 3) seeking a roman-\ntic partner and chronicling a relationship’s life cycle (Lazzara, 2010). \nIn comparison, Myspace and Facebook have been used by LGBTQ \nindividuals of all ages for both online extensions of offline sexual \nidentities or for the beginning stages of claiming a minority sexual \nidentity in general (Cooper & Dzara, 2010; Drushel, 2010). Moreover, \nchat rooms bring together sexual minority populations such as mar-\nried lesbians seeking community (Cooper, 2010), as do virtual com-\nmunities like RealJock.com targeting gay men in the military when \nDon’t Ask, Don’t Tell (henceforth DADT) was in effect (Tsika, 2010), \nthe UK-based “Fetish Scene” website targeting LGBTQ-identified \nfetishists (Barber, 2010), and transgender individuals’ personal ads on \nCraigslist (Farr, 2010). \n Scholars have argued that the Internet provides LGBTQ individ-\nuals “new possibilities for agency” that “encourage change and prog-\nress” (Pullen, 2010, p. 3) with “ramifications for identity, community, \nand political action” (Alexander & Losh, 2010, p. 46), yet others are \nadamant about how “online new media are a mixed blessing” con-\ncerning sexual health (Clift, 2010) and cyberbullying (Blumenfeld & \nCooper, 2010). Alongside consideration of LGBTQ online participa-\ntion, a brief overview of LGBTQ youth suicidality research provides \nfurther insight into the development of the IGBP, as described in the \nfollowing section.\nSuicidality Among LGBTQ Youths \n The relationship between sexual orientation and youth suicide is \nnot a new development despite the recent influx in media coverage \naccording to Charles Robbins, director of the non-profit Trevor Proj-\nPage 35\ntheJSMS.org\nect, an organization focusing on LGBTQ youth suicide prevention (as \ncited in Weise, 2010). Correspondingly, the study of youth suicide is \nnot a new phenomenon – among youths presumed to be heterosex-\nual. LGBTQ youth-specific suicide research is sparse comparatively \nand limited methodologically, however, and within the acronym \nresearch has focused almost exclusively on gay, lesbian, and bisexual \nindividuals in descending frequency (Haas et al., 2011). \n Much of the earlier LGBTQ youth suicide research conducted on \na nationwide scale failed to include sexual orientation as a separate \nvariable or was plagued by sampling problems, erroneous conclu-\nsions, or a lack of information pertaining to factors leading to in-\ncreased risk among LGBTQ youths specifically (Eliason, 2011; Haas \net al., 2011; Russell, 2003). Moreover, researchers’ varying conceptu-\nalizations and subsequent suicide measures have made longitudinal \ncomparison of LGBTQ youth suicide research extremely difficult, \nlimiting the knowledge base and potentially paralyzing the creation of \ntreatment programs (Saewyc et al., 2004). Haas et al. (2011) explained \nthe need for separating suicidal ideation, attempts, and completion \nmeasures for validity and noted that LGBTQ suicide completion \nfigures remain unknown because sexual orientation is rarely included \nin death records.\n Overwhelmingly researchers have found that an LGB identity \nis correlated more strongly with suicide completion than is a het-\nerosexual identity (Berlan et al., 2010; Mathy et al., 2009; Murphy, \n2007; Qin, Agerbo, & Mortensen, 2003; Renaud et al., 2010). Com-\nparatively, research on suicide attempts has found LGB individuals at \ngreater risk than their heterosexual peers (Langhinrichsen-Rohling, \nLamis, & Malone, 2011; Mathy, 2002; Remafeldi et al., 1998; Russell, \n2003; Russell & Joyner, 2001; Savin-Williams, 2001; Zhao et al., 2010), \nwith gender acting as a stronger predictor of attempts for males than \nfemales (King et al., 2008). Further complicating matters is the no-\ntion that sexual orientation and/or study participants’ comfort level \nin disclosing their sexual orientation may change over time (Savin-\nWilliams & Ream, 2007). Youths who have same-sex attractions but \ndo not identify as LGB are not as likely to be included in LGBTQ-\nspecific samples (Savin-Williams, 2001), and the very measurement \nof youth suicidal behavior is both difficult to undergo given the \nchallenges of recruiting youths for research studies and controversial \n(Kulkin, Chauvin, & Percle, 2000).\nPage 36                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\n Before reaching suicide ideation, which Hammelman (1993) \nfound started as early as age eight, LGBTQ individuals typically \nendure a number of stressors including harassment and bullying from \npeers. Proprietary research revealed that one-third of teens surveyed \nreported being harassed because of peers’ perceptions of or self-iden-\ntification as LGB, and nearly 90% of LGBTQ-identified students were \nverbally harassed, physically harassed, and/or physically assaulted \nduring the past year (Harris Interactive and GLSEN, 2005). Com-\npared to earlier findings, the frequency of sexual orientation-based \nharassment and assault increased between 2005 and 2009 and also \nexpanded to online venues (Kosciw et al., 2009), including Twitter, \nFacebook, YouTube, and MySpace despite the sites’ explicit anti-bul-\nlying policies. \n Sexual orientation-based harassment and discrimination com-\nmonly continues into the college years as well, and certainly harass-\nment and bullying is not limited to peers. LGBTQ collegians reported \nmore harassment than their heterosexual peers based on their sexual \nminority status (Rankin et al., 2010), and a lack of counseling services \noffering LGBTQ-specific assistance for students further contributes \nto the problem (Wright & McKinley, 2011). As Savin-Williams (1994) \nfound, lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths frequently receive verbal and \nphysical harassment from peers and adults alike, both within and \noutside of the school environment, and additional stressors leading \nto suicidality include gender role nonconformity (Ploderl & Fartacek, \n2006), familial or extra-familial issues (Diamond et al., 2011; Ham-\nmelman, 1993; Remafeldi, Farrow, & Deisher, 1991), and stressors \nassociated with the coming out process (Schneider, Farberow, & \nKrurks, 1989). \n Not only are LGBTQ youths generally at higher risk for legal \n(tobacco and alcohol) and illegal drug use than their heterosexual \npeers, but that risk is heightened among LGBTQ bullying victims \n(Bontempo & D’Augelli, 2002; King et al., 2008; Savin-Williams, \n1994). Along with suicidality, the stressors also lead to problems at \nschool, criminal activity, and homelessness (Savin-Williams, 1994), \nand LGBTQ youths have been found to be at greater risk for mental \nhealth problems (Fergusson, Horwood, & Beautrais, 1999), the preva-\nlence of which has been associated with lacking state-level institu-\ntional protections for LGBTQ individuals (Hatzenbuehler, Keyes, & \nHasin, 2009; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2010). Moreover, familial support, \nPage 37\ntheJSMS.org\ninstitutional support (predominantly schools), and support from \nnon-familial adults can act as additional barriers to suicidal behaviors \n(Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006).\n While empirical suicidality research is ongoing and measures are \nrefined, little research has been conducted on the use of crowdsourc-\ning and social media for suicide prevention, nor has the concept of \nattribution been applied to user-generated strategic communication. \nAs Haas et al. (2011) asserted, additional research must include sub-\ngroups within the LGBTQ populations, particularly those whom have \nbeen excluded previously. With the advent of technologies such as \nYouTube, digitally-savvy members of the LGBTQ populations previ-\nously excluded from mainstream media representation have the tools \nto create and disseminate their own messaging to reach LGBTQ-\nidentified or questioning youth. LGBTQ populations no longer have \nto rely upon distorted and minimal mainstream media representa-\ntions, or be subjected to researchers’ typically invasive, non-inclusive, \nnon-generalizable survey sampling techniques as the dominant form \nof suicidality-related research. \n As Grusin (2009) asserts, YouTube “allows us to extend our \nsenses beyond the range of our body’s geographic environment, \nintroducing us to people and places, sights and sounds that we would \nnot otherwise have the opportunity to perceive” (p. 61), and Thornton \n(2009) labeled YouTube “worthy of study as a new cultural phenom-\nenon” (p. 54) for reasons including but not limited to the fact that \nYouTube “allows for a cross-cultural dialogue” (p. 65). Ultimately, a \nYouTube video created as a statement or assertion of identity be-\ncomes a datum for this study. While the use of videos for educational \npurposes is not a new phenomenon (Snelson & Perkins, 2009), what \nis new is the sheer volume of content and accessibility. By harnessing \nsocial media’s ease of participation, rapid speed of message dissemi-\nnation, continually-growing archive of content, and global reach, the \nIGBP provides social media researchers an opportunity to learn about \nLGBTQ bullying and harassment on YouTube through the applica-\ntion of the theoretical concept of attribution, explained below.\nTheoretical Framework of Attribution \n Defined as “a process of making inferences about the unobserv-\nable characteristics of other people, objects, events, or ourselves” \n(Oskamp & Schultz, 2005, p. 34), attribution is a concept studied \nPage 38                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\nextensively for nearly seven decades. As Forsterling (2001) describes \nit, attribution is both a descriptor of common sense and an explainer \nof how it works, and the “central focus of attribution research lies in \nthe investigation of thoughts or cognitions and…how individuals \nselect, process, store, recall, and evaluate (causally relevant) informa-\ntion and how the information is then used to draw causal inferences” \n(p. 10). Although the phrase “attribution theory” appears in academic \nliterature with regularity, several theoretical frameworks fall under \nthe heading of attribution and there is not one “attribution theory” \n(Kelley & Michela, 1980). \n The concept of attribution is frequently viewed as originating \nin social psychology from Heider’s (1944, 1958) research that was \nconcerned with how everyday people make sense of both their own \nand others’ behaviors and how those interpretations affect behavioral \nresponses. Heider presented a conceptual framework for the scien-\ntific testing and theoretical development of what would later become \nattribution, though some argue that attribution’s roots predate Heider \n(Forsterling, 2001). Building from Heider’s framework, Jones & Davis \n(1965) introduced correspondent inference theory, followed by Kel-\nley’s (1967) attribution cube and Weiner’s (1974) cognitive theory of \nmotivation. In later work, scholars would argue that there are actually \ntwo branches of attribution-related research underway, termed “at-\ntribution” and “attributional” research: The former considers attribu-\ntion’s antecedents, including “information, beliefs, and motivations,” \nwhereas the latter considers attribution’s consequences, specifically \nthe “behavior, affect, and expectancy” (Kelley & Michela, 1980, p. \n459). \n A core component of attribution research concerns the distinc-\ntion between internal and external attributions (Forsterling, 2001; \nHeider, 1958; Weiner et al., 1971). Internal attributions are explana-\ntions individuals ascribe to something within either her/himself or \nintrinsic to another person, whereas external attributions are ex-\nplained by outside, environmental issues. Perhaps the most famous \nerror within attribution research is Ross’ (1977) fundamental attribu-\ntion error in which individuals claim internal rationales for their own \nsuccesses and external rationales for their own failures whereas for \nothers, the exact opposite is true. \n Because of its focus on casuality, the bulk of early attribution \nresearch used experimental designs to test hypotheses, but scholars \nPage 39\ntheJSMS.org\nhave employed other methods such as surveys (Orvis, Kelley, & But-\nler, 1976; Wiley, Crittenden, & Birg, 1979) and quantitative content \nanalyses (Bettman & Weitz, 1983; Lau, 1984; Lau & Russell, 1980; \nPeterson, 1980) to question attribution research’s external validity \noutside the laboratory (Crittenden, 1983; Forsterling, 2001; Lau & \nRussell, 1980). In the last few decades, attribution researchers have \nemployed various qualitative methods including discourse analysis \n(Hilton, 1990; Hindman, 1999; Staton, 1984) and ethnographic con-\ntent analysis (Hindman, 2003), and Rees, Ingledew, and Hardy (2005) \nargued:\n…varied qualitative methodologies, such as categorical content \nanalysis, paradigmatic analysis, conversation analysis, or narra-\ntive analysis might help us better understand and interpret the \nattributions people make and allow us to view the day-to-day \nprocess of attributional thinking. (p. 197) \n Attribution research continues to take several methodological \nforms; has been studied across numerous disciplines; and has been \ncombined with other theoretical frameworks in Sociology (Crit-\ntenden, 1983; Mathisen, 1989), Journalism (Hindman, 1999, 2003), \nand Business (Bettman & Weitz, 1983), among other disciplines. \nAs attribution studies extend into strategic communication (Choi \n& Lin, 2009; Coombs, 2007; Golden, 1977; Jeong, 2009), this study \nconsiders a relatively new form of strategic communication taking \nplace within social media. Heeding Heider’s (1958) proclamation that \nthrough the “careful analysis of language expressions, we can attempt \nto arrive at concepts that will enable us to clarify the implicit rela-\ntions among words referring to psychological phenomena” (p. 10); \nLau and Russell’s (1980) advice concerning the “usefulness of archival \ndata to attribution research” (p. 36); and Harvey and Martin’s (1995) \nassertion that “applications of naturalistic techniques to probe story-\nmaking activities are occurring for investigations of diverse popula-\ntions that cannot be readily studied in the university laboratory” (p. \n92), this study seeks understanding of attribution’s role in the IGBP. \nUsing Heider’s conceptualizations of internal versus external attribu-\ntions as a theoretical lens, this exploratory study answers the follow-\ning research questions: 1) In what capacity are LGBTQ harassment \nand bullying discussed in the IGBP videos?; and 2) What is the role \nof attribution in the IGBP videos, and how is it manifested internally \nPage 40                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\nversus externally?\nMethod & Limitations\n Ethnographic content analysis (henceforth ECA) was used to an-\nalyze a sample of 50 IGBP videos and answer the research questions \nposed. A brief overview of the method is provided below, including \nrationale for using ECA as opposed to quantitative content analysis as \nwell as information pertaining to the study’s sample. \n Altheide (1987) described ECA as a “reflexive” and “highly inter-\nactive” method “used to document and understand the communica-\ntion of meaning as well as verify theoretical relationships. ECA is ori-\nented to check, supplement, and supplant prior theoretical claims by \nsimultaneously obtaining categorical and unique data for every case \nstudied” (p. 68). Drawing from Mead, Blumer, Schutz, and Berger and \nLuckmann’s theoretical and methodological positions, as well as Gla-\nser and Strauss’ conceptualization of constant case comparison, ECA \nis a systematic and analytic approach to studying media content with \nthe goal of understanding not just standalone media content, but also \nhow it was produced. As Altheide (1996) describes it, the method is \nsituated on a methodological spectrum halfway between participant \nobservation and quantitative content analysis.\n Although ECA does incorporate numerical data into findings \nwhen applicable, it is important to distinguish the method from \nquantitative content analysis, which is rooted in the post-positivist \nparadigm and has the goal of objective verification through reliability \nand validity. Quantitative content analyses employ predetermined \nand theoretically-driven categories in coding protocols; ideally rely \nupon random samples; and statistically-based analysis is conducted \non large sample sizes. Comparatively, ECA has the goal of subjective \ndiscovery and values a researcher’s positionality; relies upon non-\nrandom, purposive sampling; and generally centers on the interpre-\ntive, in-depth analysis of a small corpus of data. An ECA may begin \nwith some predetermined categories but places a strong emphasis \non emergent categories, and the data collection, analysis, and inter-\npretation stages are not separate and finite as in quantitative content \nanalysis (Altheide, 1996). ECA has been used to study media content \n(Hindman, 1999, 2003; Stokes, 2007), although no published stud-\nies using ECA were found yet in which the media content analyzed \nincluded user-generated videos pertaining to a social change. Hence, \nPage 41\ntheJSMS.org\nthis study represents one of the first known attempts to do so.\n Moving beyond the restrictions inherent within survey and \nexperimental research where respondents must first be recruited \nand then answer researcher-dictated questions, this study offers an \nalternative perspective on harassment and bullying in the twenty-first \ncentury expressed through social media, is not subject to many of \nthe measurement challenges characteristic of the quantitative sui-\ncidality research previously described, and the international reach of \nthe IGBP offers data extending beyond U.S. borders. Because of this \nstudy’s exploratory nature and desire to understand both how bul-\nlying and harassment are discussed and how the videos themselves \nwere produced, using ECA permitted me to answer these research \nquestions in a way that quantitative content analysis does not. Rather \nthan approaching the study with a predetermined coding protocol \nand a focus on frequency, ECA purposefully allows for coding catego-\nries to emerge through data analysis and intentionally includes infor-\nmation outside of the videos to further enhance deeper understand-\ning of the texts themselves. Before the pervasiveness and patterns \nof bullying and harassment verbiage and associated attributions can \nbe ascertained, a baseline understanding of these categories must be \nestablished. Furthermore, because of ECA’s focus on the verification \nof theoretical relationships, the method affords a way to determine \nthe role of attribution within the IGBP and understanding about to \nwhom or what IGBP participants blame their victimization. \n Following the tenets of ECA, the study first involved watch-\ning a random selection of IGBP videos to get a sense of the project’s \nstructure while also reading extensively about the IGBP outside of \nYouTube through the official IGBP website (www.itgetsbetter.org), \nmainstream and LGBTQ niche media coverage of it, and social media \nchatter in blogs and on Facebook and Twitter. Doing so allowed for a \ndeeper understanding of the IGBP’s creation, overall objective, how \nparticipants developed videos, and who produced them in the proj-\nect’s initial launch, thereby setting the tone for the IGBP.\n After watching several tens of videos, a preliminary coding pro-\ntocol was drafted that included descriptive categories such as video \nsetting, videographer’s perceived sex, age, race, mentions of harass-\nment and bullying types, and types of attributions that I used for the \nbeginning stage of analysis. Because the goal was to understand the \ndiscourse presented within the first few weeks of the IGBP’s launch \nPage 42                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\nand ECA entails a deep understanding achieved through multiple \nreadings of texts, a small corpus of IGBP videos was purposefully \nsampled for analysis. Fifty videos were sampled, which represented a \n0.01% sample of the total IGBP population in existence today: 50,000 \nvideos. Upon establishing sample size, a handful of the videos were \nreviewed and the protocol revised according to what was found with-\nin them. This iterative process of reviewing videos and revising the \nprotocol repeated itself throughout data analysis, and all videos in the \nsample were viewed several times to check existing codes against one \nanother and determine if other codes were emerging. All codes were \ntabulated on a spreadsheet in a data matrix listing pre-determined \nand emergent categories as determined.\n One of the challenges of studying an ongoing social media-based \nproject is that the content is constantly evolving, rendering it neces-\nsary to draw temporal boundaries to collect a sample for analysis. \nThe IGBP is comprised entirely of user-generated content, and \nviewers can rank videos both by the number of times they have been \nviewed and by selecting “like” or “dislike” after creating an account \nand logging onto YouTube. The 50 videos with the highest number \nof views were selected as the unit of analysis because IGBP viewers \ndetermined these videos to be influential in some manner within the \ncontext of LGBTQ-centric harassment and bullying. In accordance \nwith ECA, this study’s sample included videos from one stage of the \nIGBP’s development. Therefore, the study’s findings are not intended \nfor extrapolation to the IGBP as a whole, nor can they necessarily \nspeak to topical themes and attributions within videos from other \npoints within the IGBP life cycle. However, these highly-ranked \nvideos offered insight into messaging pervasive at the IGBP’s launch, \nwhich speaks to implications for audience reception (i.e., what is the \nIGBP actually saying; what tone was established at the outset?) as well \nas production (i.e., whom is creating the messages/setting the tone?). \nAs will be divulged in the next sections, the sample was largely com-\nprised of celebrities and therefore likely had unique implications for \nboth audience reception and production.\n All sample videos were uploaded onto YouTube within the first \nthree weeks of the channel’s founding. Using Snag-It, software that \ntakes computer screen snapshots allowing for point-in-time catego-\nrization of constantly-changing websites, videos were copied from \nYouTube and digitally saved offline. After numbering each video and \nPage 43\ntheJSMS.org\ntabulating length and number of views, preliminary descriptive sta-\ntistics were generated to gain a cursory understanding of the project’s \ncomposition in line with the tenets of ECA (Altheide, 1996), and de-\nscriptive data are provided in the next section including information \nabout the samples’ perceived racial, gender, and age demographics \nin conjunction with the settings in which the videos were filmed and \nvideographers’ appearance.\nAnalysis and Discussion\n A total of 811 videos from the IGBP channel were captured \non October 15, 2010, and within the sample of 50 videos analyzed, \naverage video length was approximately four minutes. Sample videos \nranged from nearly 30 seconds to almost 13 minutes in length. The \nmost frequently watched video in the sample, Savage and Miller’s \ninitial contribution, had 846,683 total views at the time of capture, \nwhich had more than doubled by the time of writing. Comparatively, \nthe fiftieth video had 16,060 total views. \n Individuals with some degree of fame created over three-quarters \nof the sample videos. It is not entirely surprisingly that celebrity \nvideos were the most watched at the time of the project’s launch \nconsidering that youth are the IGBP’s intended target audience and \nare likely drawn to celebrity endorsement. Actors and actresses from \ntelevision, film, radio, and theater contributed videos, as did pop \nmusicians, comediennes, Internet personalities, and politicians. The \nremaining videos were created by the non-famous, including police \nofficers, marines, business professionals, composers, clergy members, \nand students. The vast majority of videos featured just one speaker \nproviding a testimonial, and less than one-quarter featured multiple \nspeakers. This sample’s composition of celebrities has implications for \nhow harassment and bullying are discussed as well as to what they \nare attributed. Celebrities’ victimization is no less valid than everyday \nfolks’, but their dominance within the sample likely dictates the type \nof messaging subsequent videographers would include later on.\n Within the predominantly celebrity-filled sample, additional \ninformation was gathered pertaining to gender expression, perceived \nage, and perceived race. Men accounted for over two-thirds of all vid-\neos; women were featured in less than one quarter of all videos; and \nboth sexes appeared together in the remaining five. Self-identified \ntransgender individuals appeared in just three videos. These findings \nPage 44                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\nconflict with recent survey data from the Pew Internet & American \nLife Project that found women are more likely to participate on social \nnetworking sites than are men (Duggan & Brenner, 2013), though the \nsurvey did not account for transgender participation, further render-\ning data on transgender Internet usage sparse (Farr, 2010). \n Alongside gender expression, videographers skewed younger: \nmost videos were created by those appearing to be in their thirties \n(17 videos), twenties (nine), and lastly, forties (eight). Videos from \nteen producers as well as a handful from those in their fifties, sixties, \nand seventies also surfaced, and approximately one-fifth of the videos \nincluded multiple speakers of various ages. Videographers’ age demo-\ngraphics align with Duggan and Brenner’s (2013) recent findings that \nusers of social networking sites skew younger: individuals between \n18-29 years old index the highest, followed by individuals 30-49 years \nold.\n The sample’s racial composition was perceived to be almost \nuniversally Caucasian: 85% of all videos featured exclusively White \nspeakers. Just two sample videos featured only Black speakers, and \nfive videos featured a racially-mixed group (White, Black, and Asian), \nfindings that are in direct opposition to Duggan and Brenner’s (2013) \nsurvey research that found Hispanics and Blacks/African Americans \n(non-Hispanic) indexed higher than Whites on social networking \nusage, and more specifically video-sharing sites such as YouTube \n(Moore, 2011). Although a quantitative content analysis is necessary \nto offer definitive statements about the gender expression, perceived \nage, and perceived racial composition of IGBP participants holisti-\ncally, subjectively these findings elicit notions of the user-generated \nIGBP reifying mainstream media representation of LGBTQ individu-\nals as almost exclusively White, younger, and male – at least amongst \nvideos most likely to be viewed (Aslinger, 2010; Gross, 2002; Kane et \nal., 2012; Sender, 2004; Streitmatter, 2009; Walters, 2003). Not only is \nthis composition false when compared to available data on LGBTQ-\nidentified individuals, it is problematic because the visual information \nundoubtedly provides additional information about what it means to \nbe LGBTQ- or ally-identified and could serve as a detractor for view-\ners outside of these boundaries who may think that once again, they \ndo not fit in.\n By bringing in contextual information about the documents \nunder study (Altheide, 1996), videographers’ sexual orientation data \nPage 45\ntheJSMS.org\nwere gathered based on their own verbiage, captions beneath their \nvideos, or information about them available online, independent of \nthe IGBP. Individuals who self-identified as gay men comprised the \nmajority of videographers, followed by heterosexual allies, bisexual \nmen and women, and lesbian women, respectively, though several \ngroup videos did include individuals of various sexual orientations. \nOf the videos included in the sample, bisexuality and transgender \nissues were minimally discussed, rendering the second half of the \nacronym nearly invisible once again (Brooks et al., 2008; Grant et al., \n2010; Kane et al., 2012) within IGBP videos garnering the highest \nviewership statistics. The projected IGBP image is that of gay men \ntelling viewers of all sexual orientations, gender expressions, and gen-\nder identities that their lives will get better. However, videographers \nlikely have little to no personal experience with viewers’ multidimen-\nsional identities, thus making it possible for their verbiage to be over-\nlooked or outright ignored by the intended audience. Future research \nshould consider these results and use purposive sampling techniques \nto deliberately gather information from People of Color, including \nthose with bisexual and/or transgender identities and varying gender \nexpressions to gain additional IGBP understanding.\n Having presented a brief overview of the sample’s composition \nand articulating its limitations, I now shift to explaining the emerg-\ning themes that surfaced regarding how harassment and bullying are \ndiscussed in the videos and the role of attribution within the IGBP. In \ntotal, three themes emerged concerning how videographers discussed \nharassment and bullying: 1) personalization of experience, including \ndiscussions of the types of harassment and/or bullying they had faced \nand their own suicidality; 2) resources available to at-risk LGBTQ \nand questioning youth; and 3) hollow explanation and repetition \nof “it gets better” pertaining to viewers’ current victimization. Each \ntheme is elaborated on below. \nOverarching Themes in the IGBP Videos\n Unsurprisingly given the IGBP’s focus, one theme that emerged \nwas personalized discussion of the types of harassment and bullying \nvideographers experienced. It is important to note that not all vid-\neographers either experienced or explicitly revealed getting verbally \nor physically victimized since some made videos simply to show their \nsupport of bullied LGBTQ youth; nearly one-third did not explicitly \nPage 46                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\ndiscuss experiencing bullying or harassment. Within the remaining \ntwo-thirds, bullying or harassment-centric verbiage can be separated \nby verbal, physical, or a combination of verbal and physical attacks. \nVideographers’ stories of their subjugation to others’ verbal attacks \nwere most common, as two-fifths of the sample described their verbal \nvictimization in their video. Recollections of verbal harassment con-\ncentrated on the names they were called, which often centered on the \nintersection of sexual orientation and gender (i.e., “fag/faggot,” “gay,” \n“lesbian,” “dyke,” “homo,” and “fairy”) but also included racial and \nreligious epithets as well. Actress Adrienne Curry’s memories were \namong the most vivid, as she recounted peers called her a “fucking \nlesbian,” “worthless dyke,” “carpet muncher,” and “fish eater” for kiss-\ning a girl in high school. Similarly, singer Danny Noriega recollected \npeers’ hurling “every name in the book” at him, and Councilman \nJoel Burns’ bullies told him “that he should die and go to hell where \nhe belonged.” Others stated more generally that they were harassed, \nbullied, “picked on,” “ridiculed,” “threatened,” “tormented,” “teased,” \nor “scrutinized” without going into detail, though some pinpointed \nparticular phases of schooling (elementary, middle, or high school) in \nwhich the harassment and bullying occurred, including one 14-year-\nold New York City youth whose harassment started in Kindergarten. \nDespite the IGBP’s focus on youths surviving middle and high school \nhardships, some videographers noted that verbal harassment extends \nbeyond grades K-12, to include this very project where bullies leave \nhateful comments underneath videos. Nonetheless, this acknowledge-\nment was rare, and collectively the sample regurgitated the myth of \nvictimization relegated exclusively to youths in grades K-12 as started \nin Savage and Miller’s initial video. This myth was repeated numer-\nous times throughout the sample and could have negative effects on \nviewers by promising youths that life gets better instantaneously upon \nleaving high school. Several libel and defamation lawsuits filed by \nadults subjected to others’ sexual orientation-based verbal abuse offer \nevidence that these spatial and temporal claims are empirically false \n(Phillips, 2012). \n Comparatively, victims who were physically attacked universally \nexperienced both physical and verbal harassment, with bullies’ verbal \nattacks taking place before, during, and/or after the physical alterca-\ntions. Over one-quarter of videographers verbalized getting “beaten \nup,” “roughed up,” “punched,” “kicked,” “body slammed,” “thrown \nPage 47\ntheJSMS.org\nagainst walls, lockers, and windows,” “picked up and spun around,” \n“stuffed into bathroom stalls,” “shoved,” or “tripped” by their tormen-\ntors. One of the more graphic stories was relayed by a music com-\nposer named Harry who recounted getting “kicked in the head by a \ngroup of people, laying there in the middle of the street until a car \ncomes up because they think you’ve been hit by a car.” Videographers’ \ntestimonials also revealed that bullies frequently spat on their victims \nand threw objects at them, ranging from soda bottles to desks and \nchairs. Nearly all stories of physical attacks came from male videog-\nraphers, but females were also subjected to some physical abuse as \nwell. Nevertheless, the entanglement of sexual orientation and gender \ntriggered bullies to direct their anger towards males whom they \ntormented for perceptions of their homosexuality, thereby equating \ntheir victims’ gayness with femininity and demanding they prove \ntheir manhood through physical challenges. Recent suicide victims \nfeatured in the mainstream media were almost exclusively male, \nincluding Justin Aaberg and Billy Lucas’ suicides in summer 2010 \nthat prompted Savage and Miller to found the YouTube channel, and \nempirical research has shown that sexual minority males are more \nlikely to attempt suicide than females (King et al., 2008).\n Physical harassment and bullying were not limited to victims’ \nbodies, however, as creators mentioned defacement of their physical \nproperty as well. Terry Miller divulged that his bullies defecated on \nhis car in addition to scratching it and breaking some windows, while \none Wicked cast member had eggs thrown at both his car and house \nby his harassers and another relayed eating his lunch in the bathroom \nbecause no one would sit with him in the cafeteria. Conceivably the \nmost devastating form of victimization described included videogra-\nphers getting thrown out of their parents’ homes for revealing their \nsexuality because of their family’s social conservatism and/or strict \nreligious beliefs, and a lack of familial support for coming out has \nbeen proven it can lead to deadly results (Diamond et al., 2011; Ham-\nmelman, 1993; Remafeldi, Farrow, & Deisher, 1991).\n Beyond detailing the types of harassment and bullying experi-\nenced, another emergent theme included discussion of the various \ncomponents of suicide, namely ideation and attempts. Six videog-\nraphers recalled suicide ideation, ranging from frequent YouTuber \nDavey Wavey thinking about suicide abstractly to Bornstein planning \nto commit suicide six times but “always finding something else to do.” \nPage 48                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\nFive videographers recounted their own suicide attempts, including \nCouncilman Burns’ heartfelt speech in which he revealed for the first \ntime anywhere that he had attempted to take his own life; Tim Gunn \nand Rannon’s descriptions of swallowing large amounts of pills; David \nValdes Greenwood’s narrative of climbing a bridge and planning to \njump off of it but being stopped by a neighbor; and porn star Buck \nAngel’s emotional message of self-mutilation and attempting to take \nhis own life. From this sentiment not only are the various stages of \nsuicidality presented, but furthermore it can be surmised that IGBP \nvideographers’ intimate understanding of presumed viewers’ extreme \ndepression, loneliness, despair, and suicidality served as a motivating \nfactor for their participation in the IGBP.\n Alongside suicidality discussions, videographers frequently \noffered resources for at-risk LGBTQ youth, most often directing \nviewers to call the Trevor Project suicide hotline or visit the organiza-\ntion’s website. Two videos were actually Trevor Project public service \nannouncements featuring well-known LGBTQ-identified or –allied \nindividuals explicitly driving traffic to the IGBP benefactor. In over \none-third of the videos, specifically those created by celebrities, view-\ners were instructed to reach out to others for support, whether family \nmembers, teachers, school administrators, or librarians, or the nebu-\nlous people “who will listen” or “who you can trust.” Musicians Joel \nMadden and A.J. McClean encouraged viewers to tweet them if they \nneed someone to talk to; Gregory Gorgeous and Buck Angel instruct-\ned youth to e-mail or call them; and Sister Unity recommended view-\ners reach out to her on Facebook. Thus, some extended their services \nas anti-suicide resources by encouraging at-risk youth to reach out \nto them within and beyond social media. The latter videographers’ \nproved to be the exception to the rule, however, as most simply of-\nfered viewers a one-way monologue with no further resources. While \nextending yourself as a resource for suicidal youth is an act not all are \npsychologically or temporally positioned for, the resources offered \noutside of a dialogical outlet were few. The Trevor Project’s explicit \nfocus on suicide prevention makes it a natural partner for the IGBP, \nbut other anti-bullying and suicide prevention resources were ignored \naltogether, once again leaving viewers with little actionable informa-\ntion about where to seek help.\n Information about when “it gets better” surfaced in conjunction \nwith information detailing how – if found at all. Several videogra-\nPage 49\ntheJSMS.org\nphers mentioned finding or establishing a community of acceptance \nthrough the creation of a new family and/or making new friends and \nplaced great importance on finding others sharing similar sexual \norientations and/or gender identities to establish support systems. \nAs Jeffery Self declared, “You build a circle of people who love you \nand accept you for exactly who you are;” Scissor Sisters lead singer \nJake Shears reiterated, “you make friends and create a family full \nof people that aren’t crazy;” and Claire stated, “I have an amazing \nnetwork of friends who are gay, straight, bi, pansexual, transgender, \nand I don’t have to interact with the haters anymore if I don’t want \nto.” Additional support systems videographers presented included \njoining gay-straight alliances (GSAs) or other LGBTQ-affiliated youth \ngroups and finding love interests ranging from girlfriends/boyfriends \nto partners or spouses. Gregory Gorgeous cautioned viewers that they \nmight need to make changes in their own lives to allow these sup-\nport systems to develop and warned viewers not to “think it’s going \nto be an overnight thing; you’re going to have to deal with some shit.” \nCelebrities Perez Hilton, Adrienne Curry, and Jewel corroborated \nGorgeous’ rhetoric by explaining that with age comes perspective, as \nJewel stated: \nI can’t even tell you how much it gets better. It really, really, really \ndoes. It’s a very temporary thing, adolescence, and you can really \nhave any type of life that you choose. And you get to make those \nchoices, so you’ve just got to hang on until you can have the free-\ndom to do that. Until then, just be loud and be proud.\n Videographers’ explanations of finding or establishing commu-\nnity were problematic because they were predicated on the fact that \nthis was done during adulthood, offering little hope to youth trapped \nin a vicious cycle of victimization and loneliness as adolescents or \nteens potentially several years away from reaching adulthood. De-\nspite interim suggestions of joining GSAs or LGBTQ-affiliated youth \ngroups and the proven therapeutic benefits of joining them (Goode-\nnow, Szalacha, & Westheimer, 2006), videographers did not reference \nthe reality that most at-risk youth who may not yet self-identify as \nLGBTQ (and even among those that do) likely are not psychologically \nready to join such groups nor are groups geographically available or \naccessible to them in their current locales. Furthermore, the notion of \nfinding community or joining non-existent LGBTQ-affiliated organi-\nPage 50                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\nzations was also shrouded in rhetoric of leaving a hometown behind \nand seeking acceptance elsewhere, an activity that is classist in its \nimplication and not financially feasible to all viewers.\n As anticipated, video content varied tremendously, but the phrase \n“it gets better” proved to be an oft-repeated mantra, often times with \nlittle explanation or proffering of truly helpful information about \nhow, when, where, and for whom “it gets better,” and few videogra-\nphers offered in-depth answers to these queries, which is a lingering \ncriticism of the IGBP (Doyle, 2010; Veldman, 2010). Of those vid-\neographers who did elaborate, a handful mentioned life “instantly” \nimproving the day that they graduated from high school; left behind \nhouseholds and family members that did not accept their LGBTQ \nidentities; and/or moved away from their hometowns to American \nand Canadian cities known to be more gay-friendly. Others explained \nthat life improved when they learned to accept themselves for who \nthey are and stopped relying upon others’ opinions to dictate their \nown self-worth. As two gay men within a four-person group video \narticulated: “Just because things have happened to you doesn’t mean \nthey have to continue” and “you are the captain of your own soul, \nyour own fate.” For Councilman Joel Burns, life got better with per-\nsonal milestones: proposing to and marrying his husband; winning \nhis first city council election; and gaining his father’s acceptance. Not \nonly does the very sentiment of “it gets better” demand problematiza-\ntion because of the numerous sociological assumptions underlying \nfor whom it is likely to get better, but furthermore a regurgitation of \nthe phrase “it gets better” alone is hollow and patently unhelpful to \nviewers looking for actionable insights into to how, what, where, why, \nand most pertinently, when their lives will improve.\n One exception to the chorus of “it gets better” was Kate Born-\nstein’s video in which she boldly proclaimed that life does not always \nimprove; rather, sometimes it gets worse. While other videographers \nmade passing mention of future challenges outside of the grade \nschool walls – including an ACLU video in which one speaker tells \nviewers not to “give up and miss the good and bad parts of life” \n– Bornstein was one of the only people in the sample to blatantly \nquestion the repeated manta of “it gets better” overall. Bornstein, an \nIvy League-educated transgender-identified author, playwright, per-\nformance artist, and gender theorist, has written and spoken exten-\nsively about gender and suicide internationally to youth and college \nPage 51\ntheJSMS.org\nstudents and attempted suicide multiple times herself (“About Kate \nBornstein,” 2013).   \nAttributions within the IGBP Videos \n After determining emergent themes of discussion, an under-\nstanding of what attributions were made within the IGBP was sought, \nspecifically with regards to whom or what harassment/ bullying and \nassertions of life “getting better” are attributed. Both areas are ex-\nplored in greater depth below to reveal and differentiate between both \ninternal and external attributions.\n Pertaining to bullying and harassment, videographers’ internal \nattributions included blaming themselves for their misery, self-ha-\ntred, and internalized homophobia. For some, this self-hatred led to \ntrying to “pray the gay away,” suicide attempts, or family and friends-\nled interventions. Internal attributions were far less common than \nbullying and harassment-related external attributions, of which six \ncategories surfaced: 1) school; 2) family; 3) government; 4) religion; \n5) geography; and 6) general bullies.\n Unsurprisingly given the IGBP’s youth-centric focus and the fact \nthat youth spend a substantial portion of time at school, school was \ncited as a frequent setting for bullying, and videographers’ bullies in-\ncluded peers, teachers, and school administrators who often blamed \nthem for getting bullied because of the way they spoke, behaved in \ngender non-conforming ways, or their refusal to “keep their private \nlife private.” Both teachers and politicians noted that schools need to \nbe “safe havens” where kids are protected from harassment and not \nthe site of such vicious attacks.\n In addition to school-affiliated peers and adults, family members \nwere frequently mentioned in the context of attributing bullying and \nharassing behaviors. Overwhelmingly, additional harassment came \nfrom family members who told videographers that LGBTQ identifi-\ncation is unnatural and they were doomed if they identified as such; \nhurled homophobic and sexist slurs at them; or otherwise made them \nfeel like outsiders and isolated them from the rest of the family. One \nMuslim teen revealed that when he came out to his father, his father \ntold him that the rest of the family could not hear about his sexual \norientation and that he was a failure, though later his father eventu-\nally accepted his son back into the family. Because family members \nPage 52                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\ncan be the source of much support or abuse, which directly impacts \nsuicidality as previously discussed (Diamond et al., 2011; Hammel-\nman, 1993; Remafeldi, Farrow, & Deisher, 1991), Councilman Burns \nand Perez Hilton cautioned viewers to speak to family members only \nif they are able to do so without retribution. On just two occasions, \nvideographers spoke of having a strong family support system that \naccepted them early on.\n Both state and federal governments were blamed for bullying, as \nwere religious institutions and geography. Within government struc-\ntures, anti-LGBTQ policies, such as marriage inequality/California’s \nProposition 8, DADT, and various state-level initiatives pertaining to \nunequal rights were cited as government-mandated evidence of bul-\nlying. Moreover, videographers also blamed politicians and political \npundits for spewing homophobic rhetoric, as illustrated by comedi-\nenne Sarah Silverman’s attack on voters and policymakers: \nDear America: when you tell gay Americans that they can’t serve \ntheir country openly or marry the person that they love, you’re \ntelling that to kids, too. So don’t be fucking shocked and won-\nder where all of these bullies are coming from that are torturing \nyoung kids and driving them to kill themselves because they’re \ndifferent. They learned it from watching you.\n Within religious institutions, religious zealots were criticized for \nlying to kids about their impending doom because of their sexual ori-\nentation, and individuals within both the Christian and Islamic faiths \nwere cited as problematic for LGBTQ youth because of their hateful \nand misleading rhetoric. Interestingly, while clergy members and re-\nligiously devoted videographers outside of the sample have expressly \nchallenged religious zealots’ false discourse asserting homo/bisexual-\nity and transgender identification are incompatible with major world \nreligions (Bauer, 2010; songbyrd5, 2010; Taylor, 2010; Tupper, 2011), \nviewership of these videos was far less prevalent than that of celebri-\nties who either did not speak of religion altogether or did little to \nchallenge this prevailing sentiment. \n One videographer noted vast differences in bullying and harass-\nment based on where individuals live and that in some places it is \n“not possible to be out without being verbally or physically abused.” \nThe impact of geography was implicit such that many videographers \nPage 53\ntheJSMS.org\nspoke from locales that were more gay-friendly than where they had \ngrown up and their very suggestions for how and where “it gets bet-\nter” perpetuated the myth of viewers having to leave their hometown \ncommunities behind in search of a more LGBTQ-centric life for it to \n“get better.” Gray’s (2009) ethnography of queer youth in rural Ap-\npalachia debunks this myth and demonstrates that one can find and \nproject an LGBTQ identity in even the smallest and most conserva-\ntive towns. Little research beyond Gray’s has included rural LGBTQ \nyouth, which is in itself problematic and serves to further perpetuate \nthe myth of LGBTQ identity as attached to large, metropolitan areas.\n In the final category, bullies were discussed in the abstract \nthrough the creation of an us-versus-them dynamic, including face-\nless mentions of “people” (“people are mean for no reason;” “picked \non continuously by cruel people”), “them” (“you can’t give up and let \nthem win”), and “others” (“others make it a big deal that I’m gay”). \nFurther examples of generalized attributions included Chris Colfer’s \nstatement that LGBTQ youth are committing suicide due to “tragic \ncircumstances in their own environments;” comedienne Kathy Grif-\nfin’s reference to statistics on the increased likelihood of gay teens \ncommitting suicide; others’ mentions of a general lack of gay role \nmodels, LGBTQ-related groups, and broader homophobia; and \nTrevor Project PSAs that offered an outlet for at-risk LGBTQ youth \nby noting that they are “people who can help.” \n Collectively, the sample’s minimal inclusion of internal attribu-\ntions and broader focus on external attributions, such as school, \nfamily, government, religion, geography, and generalized bullies, \nis illustrative of the fact that videographers held social institutions \naccountable for their harassment and bullying and projected this \nonto their viewers as well. Videographers’ assertions rendered social \ninstitutions as both heteronormative and sexist: they are composed \nin such a way as to ideologically condone this behavior and set up \nLGBTQ-identified individuals to be victimized across multiple \ndimensions. Subsequently, videographers’ framed their own and \nothers’ harassment and bullying as a societal, institutional problem \nand not one of an individualized nature. Embedded in this framing is \nvalidation of the IGBP existence and videographers’ reassurance that \nviewers are not alone in their victimization and are also freed from \nresponsibility for their bullies’ ignorance and subsequent abuse.\nPage 54                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\n In addition to attributions pertaining to bullying and harassment, \nvideographers also made attributions in their discussions of life “get-\nting better.” Internal attributions consisted of life improving through \nself-acceptance, positive thinking, “controlling your own destiny,” and \n“doing whatever it takes to make your life more worth living.” As with \nbullying and harassment, external attributions far outnumbered in-\nternal, and most commonly external attributions concerning school, \nfamily, religion, and generalized comments surfaced. Videographers \nexplained that high school is “just a phase” and that once viewers are \nfree from its clutches they will have greater freedom to find like-\nminded individuals. Life improved for some when they finally experi-\nenced familial acceptance, and Bishop Gene Robinson offered insight \ninto how life gets better through acceptance of God who “loves you \nthe way you are despite the message you’re receiving from religious \npeople.” Generalized attributions included the ever-present notion of \ntime healing all and “society starting to be more accepting,” alongside \nviewers’ ability to find hope from the IGBP internally and externally \nand to create a support system through making new friends. \n On the whole, the frequency of videographers’ attributions per-\ntaining to harassment, bullying, and life “getting better” were exter-\nnally attributed to situational or societal influences, particularly social \ninstitutions, than internally attributed to victims’ personal charac-\nteristics. To some extent, external attributions are logical within the \ncontext of harassment and bullying stories, particularly among those \nwho are now far removed from their specific experiences of being \nvictimized as youth, and internal attributions could be indicative of \nvictim-blaming. Yet, it is less expected for internal attributions to be \nso few and far between in discussions of how videographers proac-\ntively found ways to improve their own life situations or for videog-\nraphers not to have placed greater emphasis on the likelihood that \nat-risk, suicidal youth are internalizing the reasons for their victim-\nization. Having said that, viewers’ victimization is implied by the very \ncreation of the IGBP. Through an almost exclusive focus on external \nattributions/social institutions, effectively videographers are leaving \nat-risk LGBTQ youth to believe they must depend on others (and in-\nstitutions) for their own happiness. While many scholars have argued \nthat significant institutional changes are necessary (Hatzenbuehler, \nKeyes, & Hasin, 2009; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2010; Pullen, 2010), they \nPage 55\ntheJSMS.org\nare sure to be slow-moving and in the meantime victims are trapped \nwithin many of the institutions that are the very cause of their current \nvictimization and suicidality, and some may not have the patience to \nwait out the changes. \nConclusion \n Taken as a whole, videographers’ narrowly-focused, explicit \nverbiage offers minimal information regarding their own experiences \nof LGBTQ-specific harassment and bullying, resources for viewers, or \nin-depth explanations about how life “gets better,” potentially leav-\ning viewers with more questions than answers. On account of the \nsample’s predominance of celebrities, many of whom likely jumped \non the proverbial bandwagon and perhaps used their IGBP participa-\ntion as cause for additional publicity, oftentimes simplistic messages \nfeaturing little more than a repetition of the phrase “it gets better” \nwere put forth. The vapid verbiage leaves at-risk youth without much \nunderstanding of others’ victimization experiences and thus a sense \nof kinship. More importantly, most videographers neglected to offer \ntangible information about how viewers are to survive their own \ncurrent predicaments. Instead, videographers’ glossed over both their \nown past abuses and their hardscrabble path to current happiness. In \ndoing so, they perpetuated the myths of bullying and harassment as \nconfined to K-12 schooling and life getting better post-grade school, \nneither of which have been empirically proven.\n The study affords researchers a unique look into the process of \ninternal and external attributions, and findings revealed that vid-\neographers were more likely to make external attributions about \nboth their experiences of being verbally and/or physically harassed \nor bullied as well as how life gets better. In both instances, institu-\ntions were blamed for videographers’ victimization but also viewed \nas an integral component of how life improves. Representing one \nof the first known studies to combine ECA with the theoretical lens \nof attribution, the study offers researchers broader methodological \nand theoretical applications. As previously explained, much attribu-\ntion research has been limited to experimental design, but this study \nand its predecessors have shown that attribution research can extend \nbeyond the laboratory setting. Accordingly, there is much more to be \nlearned about attribution through the use of varying research tools, \nPage 56                                                      The Journal of Social Media in Society 2(1)\nincluding but not limited to how attribution research findings are \nconfirmed or challenged through new media tools. \n The pervasiveness of LGBTQ-centric harassment, bullying, and \nsuicidality continue, and social change projects are increasingly likely \nto contain a sizable online portion rendering additional research \ninto both necessary so that problems can be identified, solutions \nproposed, and the efficacy of online-based social change projects \nunderstood. Social media provide one forum for doing so given the \nfrequency with which these discussions continue to take place online \nand the ever-expanding corpus of social media sites. Moreover there \nare several fruitful avenues for additional interdisciplinary research \nconsidering message content, production, and consumption. \nReferences\n“About Kate Bornstein.” (2013).

    "abstract": "In response to multiple youth suicides, Dan Savage and Terry Miller founded a YouTube channel that later became the It Gets Better Project (IGBP). The ever-growing corpus of IGBP videos now includes over 50,000 “messages of hope” targeting at-risk LGBTQ and questioning youth. Employing Ethnographic Content Analysis (ECA) and the theoretical lens of attribution, this study offers insight into how LGBTQ bullying and harassment are discussed in the IGBP and to what they are internally and externally attributed. Findings revealed external attributions were more prevalent than internal attributions pertaining to types of harassment and bullying experienced as well as explanations of how “it gets better,” with a focus on institutions as both the cause of and remedy for bullying and harassment",
