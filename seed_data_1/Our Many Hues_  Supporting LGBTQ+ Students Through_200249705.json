How universities meet these needs can critically impact success and retention of \nthese students. However, studies indicate when the academic and co-curricular \nenvironment does not foster development of healthy LGBTQ+ identities, these students \nexperience myriad challenges compounded by identity discord and minority stress. \nCumulatively, these factors contribute to non-persistence of over 30% of LGBTQ+ \nuniversity students. This research study examines the ways positive LGBTQ+ identity \ndevelopment, cultural capital accrual and community engagement through a structured \nmentoring program fosters resilience and buffers the experience of minority stress and \nassociated negative outcomes for these students. In doing so, the study addresses the \nfollowing research questions: what does the process of LGBTQ+ identity construction \nlook like for gender- and sexual-minority students, including students from non-dominant \ncultural backgrounds for whom LGBTQ+ identity is one of multiple competing identities, \nand how does mentorship affect the perceived identities of these students? How does \nparticipation in an LGBTQ+ mentoring program affect participants’ perceptions of \ndevelopment of resilience-building capacity?  \n \nii \nDEDICATION  \n   \nThis dissertation is dedicated to Pat, Neil and Pea, the students who bravely \nshared their voices, stories and lives with me through this project. It’s been an honor to be \na part of your journeys.  \nIt’s dedicated to Leslie, whose lifelong work for the LGBTQ+ community is an \ninspiration. Your belief in this program – and in me – was humbling. Thank you for \nsharing your stories, experience, knowledge and encouragement; you’ve been a mentor \nand inspiration, and this community is poorer for your absence. \niii \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n   \n There are so many people whose thanks are owed. This project has been a labor of \npassion, of dedication, and patience – and not only mine. \n First and foremost, thank you to the students whose lives are at the center of the \nstories shared here – Pat, Neal, and Pea, whose frankness, bravery, self-reflection, and \ngrowth over the four months we worked together in interviews impacted me more \nsubstantially than I’d ever anticipated. You have inspired me, enriched my life beyond \nthe confines of this project, and reminded me of the importance of this work. \n Thank you to my committee for the insight and support along the way. I know I \npromised this wouldn’t be a massive tome, and I know that draft after draft was \nsometimes wearying for you to read – but thank you for sticking with me through it all. I \npromise this final version is shorter than it could have been. \n Thank you to the mentors and role models who have shaped my own educational, \npersonal and professional journeys, helping me find my own voice and passions and \ndevelop and hone my strengths along the way. I hope any personal and professional \ngrowth that has brought me to this point in my life measures up to the impact you’ve had \non me – I’m grateful. Thanks especially to Regina. I’m glad to have called you my \nsupervisor, mentor, and finally friend and classmate. I’m happy we’ve traveled through \nthis journey together. Thanks for everything, boss. \n This work would not have been possible without the faculty, staff and graduate \nstudent mentors who brought the HUES LGBTQ+ mentoring project to life, and who \nbore with me through the fits and stops that accompany the development of a new \niv \nprogram. You’re all amazing people. Working with your students over the course of the \npast months has reaffirmed one thing to me – that the impact you’ve had on them has \nbeen truly special. I hope you know that.  \n Thank you to my family. You are all my cheering section, and I hope what’s been \ncreated here is a suitable testament to your encouragement.  \n Most of all, thank you to Lee, my partner in all aspects of life, my greatest \ncheerleader, and my rock. You’ve been patient through the long weekends locked away \nin front of the computer, the evenings too exhausted to do much more than sit in front of \nthe television, and the general lack of cooking, cleaning, and contribution to household \nsanity. You’ve seen me at my best, and you’ve stuck with me through statistics. Thank \nyou. You are everything. \nv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n          Page \n \nLIST OF TABLES ………………………………………………………………………xii \n \nCHAPTER \n \n1 LOCAL AND LARGER CONTEXTS, PROBLEM OF PRACTICE…... 1 \n

Personal Resilience Assessment, Pre/Post-Inventories ............................ 142 \n1 \nCHAPTER 1 \nLOCAL AND LARGER CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM OF PRACTICE \nIntroduction: Pivotal Time for a Vulnerable Population \n \nThe needs of sexual and gender minority students (lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, questioning, and intersex, collectively referred to as LBGTQ+) in higher \neducation have been the focus of increasing scrutiny in the past decade. With growing \nLGBTQ+ community representation in the public sphere, many universities are taking \nmeasures to better serve these students. However, this population’s psychosocial support \nneeds are unique, and supporting these students poses practical and philosophical \nchallenges.  \n The importance of balancing students’ academic needs with their social and \nemotional growth – and the significance of one to the other – is hardly a breakthrough. \nChickering articulated the importance of integrating the emotional development, \ninterpersonal competencies, and identity of students with their academic development in \nthe 1960s. In the time since, student development theorists from Tinto to Yosso have \nexpanded this argument, noting students from underrepresented or minoritized student \npopulations in particular face uphill battles persisting within institutions in which they are \ncultural outsiders. When students are engaged in their university communities through \nclubs and organizations, residential experiences, and other sociocultural outlets in a \nholistic development of the intellectual and interpersonal, they persist through graduation \nmore successfully and with greater academic performance (Chickering & Reisser, 1993; \nMacAllister, Ahmendani, Harold & Cramer, 2009). When space is made to recognize \n2 \ntheir own identities and cultures in the learning enterprise, students are more likely to \nthrive (Yosso, 2005). As one of the nation’s largest public universities, Arizona State \nUniversity (ASU) offers an inclusive, opportunity-rich educational experience, providing \na comprehensive array of student services and extracurricular opportunities. As is the \ncase for many of its peer institutions, however, fully understanding the needs of its \ngender and sexual minority student population remains a challenge.  \nTo meet the needs of a large, diverse student body, this institution has adopted a \nstudent-driven, staff-supported engagement model. While an increasing number of \ninstitutions operate a ‘one stop shop’ for LGBTQ+ students through LGBTQ+ \ncommunity centers responsible for both programming and support resources, ASU has \nstrategically moved away from this model. Instead, ASU’s student engagement personnel \nwork with student organizational leadership to determine and advance programming \npriorities through its Student and Cultural Engagement/International Student Engagement \n(SCE/ISE) office. SCE/ISE works with the Rainbow Coalition, the institution’s LGBTQ+ \nstudent governing body, to support the programming goals of LGBTQ+ student clubs and \norganizations and advance institutional policy changes on behest of that community. \nTheoretically, this ensures student agency in the development of the university co-\ncurricular experience. \nWhat this model does not provide, though, is a dedicated space for all LGBTQ+ \nstudents at the institution. What of students who are questioning or struggling with their \nidentities in isolation, to whom advocacy- or leadership-minded organizations require a \ndegree of identity disclosure with which they are not yet comfortable? The college \ntransition is a time of identity renegotiation in which identities shaped and developed \n3 \nsince childhood are honed, reinforced, and refined. For students whose LGBTQ+ \nidentities emerged and were shaped within supportive and inclusive environments, \nASU’s programmatic enterprises offer opportunities to further explore those identities. \nAs common as positive stories of early identity acceptance at home and in supportive \nsecondary educational settings are becoming in some parts of the country – particularly \nwithin socially progressive coastal urban and suburban centers – this idyllic coming-out \ntableau is not the experience of all LGBTQ+ students. This is especially the case for \nstudents whose home cultures do not have the confluence of sociodemographic \ndeterminants –religion, education, visibility of LGBTQ+ communities, or cultural \ncomponents – that lend toward a positive community perception of LGBTQ+ \ncommunities. As an institution with a diverse, multicultural student body, it is important \nthat ASU’s resilience- and community-building efforts toward its sexual and gender \nminority students reflect an approach inclusive of and sensitive toward the needs of these \nstudents.  \nFor gender and sexual minority students from less accepting backgrounds and \nfamilies who have nonetheless developed a strong sense of LGBTQ+ identity salience \nand affinity, the college transition presents an opportunity to explore and embrace their \nrole within a larger LGBTQ+ community; connecting to clubs, organizations, and \nprogramming is a welcome growth opportunity. For others, though, it can be \noverwhelming. Students struggling to accept or understand their LGBTQ+ identities or \nwhose backgrounds are particularly predisposed toward cultural homonegativity – \nincluding many of the institution’s international student populations – lack the \nsociocultural currency and identity affinity to easily navigate disclosure and become \n4 \ninvolved in the abovementioned programs. Missing the safe and affirming space a \nphysical LGBTQ+ center on campus provides, they are left to navigate these perilous \ncurrents on their own. \nLGBTQ+ engagement initiatives provide opportunities in community-building, \ncivic activism and student leadership, but these activities appeal to (and are led by) \nstudents with more advanced LGBTQ+ identities. In a student-driven engagement model, \nprogramming is driven by the most vocal or visible student communities – and this \ninherently excludes students whose backgrounds have given them less privilege and ease \nin navigating their LGBTQ+ identities. For these students, clinical counseling or support \ngroups are available through the institution, of course. These resources help students \nwilling to seek out ‘help’ in reconciling their identities; after a time, they may even be \ncomfortable enough to join in larger institutional programming initiatives. However, for \nmany – especially those raised to believe their sexual and/or gender identities are \n‘something wrong’ with them, psychologically – receiving counseling or seeking help \nstill retains a stigma, and until or unless they reach a moment of crisis, they persist to \nstruggle silently and in isolation. Meanwhile, both their academic and interpersonal \nidentities suffer (Tinto, 1993).  \nA growing body of LGBTQ+ identity development research (Bilodeau & Renn, \n2005; Dziengel, 2015; Fine, 2016; Halpin & Allen, 2004; Ivory, 2012; Levy, 2009; \nMulcahy, Dalton, Kolbert & Crothers, 2016; Russell & Horne, 2009; Sanlo, 2004/2005) \nindicate that support throughout the identity-development process – not just at its initial \nand culminating phases – is essential. Providing a structured development experience \nthroughout the identity development process, from initial recognition through acceptance \n5 \nand into engagement with a larger LGBTQ+ community, is necessary for identity \nsalience, the acquisition of LGBTQ+ cultural capital, resilience against minority stress, \nand academic persistence. Providing support throughout the identity navigation process is \nthe domain of an LGBTQ+ resource center for many universities; for students at ASU, \nlacking this structural resource, other identity support and enrichment opportunities must \nbe created. \n \nLocal context \n \nThe university’s approach to student service and development is unique, equally \ninformed by its size and demographic make-up and by institutional leadership values. \nASU is one of the largest public universities in the United States, with an on-campus \nstudent population between its four campuses of approximately 73,000 (enrolled by \nmajor) and an annual incoming class size of over 11,000 (ASU, 2019).  Its population is \ndiverse, both in origin and sociocultural background. Over 66% of ASU’s students are \nfrom Arizona, with significant populations from California, Texas, and Colorado, while \napproximately 14% are international in origin (ASU, 2019). Roughly mirroring the \ndemographic landscape of its larger environment, 54% of the university’s students \nidentify as Caucasian; 39% identify as non-Caucasian or mixed-race (non-international), \nand Hispanic/Latino students comprise the institution’s largest minority demographic at \n24% (2019). Male student slightly outnumber female students at both undergraduate \n(47.8% female, 52.2% male) and graduate (46.9% female, 53.1% male) levels. Although \nthe institution has made efforts in recent years to diversify its student population, \nhistorically marginalized student populations continue struggling for representation. \n6 \nCurrently, ASU does not have a means of tracking the size of its sexual and/or gender \nminority student populations. \n ASU has four campus locations throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area, and \neach retain their own distinct cultures informed both by their academic focuses and \nphysical locations. The Tempe and Downtown Phoenix campuses, housed in the \nmetropolitan area’s most culturally and socially diverse areas, are home to the largest and \nmost diverse student populations, with over 50,000 and 11,000 students, respectively \n(ASU, 2019).  Situated geographically in the most socially progressive parts of the \nmetropolitan area, students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in a rich array of \ncultural experiences and a more progressive environment; not only does Tempe have \nthriving ethnic and religious communities, but it has been named one of the West coast’s \nmost LGBTQ+ friendly tourist destinations. Downtown Phoenix boasts a variety of \ncultural and civic opportunities and is home to the institution’s community- and civic-\noriented degree programs, including its nursing, healthy innovation, and public policy \nand community solutions programs Additionally, Downtown Phoenix is home to the \nMelrose District, the metropolitan area’s de-facto LGBTQ+ community. The West and \nPolytechnic campuses, meanwhile, are located in more conservative areas (Glendale and \nMesa, respectively); interdisciplinary programs at the 4,500 student West campus draw \nheavily on local commuter and community college populations, while the 5,000 students \nat the Polytechnic campus, with its large applied engineering programs, skew more \nheavily male and international in demographic than the institution’s other campuses \n(ASU, 2019).  \n7 \n A microcosm of diversity. Over the past decade, ASU has made consistent \nefforts toward greater diversification. Under the leadership of its president, the institution \nbrands itself as a model for a ‘New American University’, pioneering an increased focus \non interdisciplinality, applied research, and creating an enhanced “knowledge-producing \nenterprise” responsible to both its local and global constituencies (ASU, 2019-a). \nEmploying nearly 17,000 faculty and staff (ASU, 2019), ASU boasts a robust student \nservice platform. ASU’s student services and engagement division provides a \ncomprehensive array of non-academic services and programming creating an inclusive, \nopportunity-rich social learning environment (ASU, 2019-a). The institution provides \nresources and support through nineteen service platforms that include health and \nwellness, student life, programming and development, advocacy and leadership.  \n Diversity and inclusion initiatives are housed out of three places within ASU. \nProgramming and awareness initiatives, including its SafeZone LGBTQ+ awareness and \ntraining program, the Rainbow Coalition LGBTQ+, and Student and Cultural \nEngagement/International Student Engagement (SCE/ISE), report to the Dean of Students \nOffice as a part of the larger Educational Opportunities and Student Services (EOSS) \ndivision. Faculty and staff training and responsibilities, including Title IX compliance \nand equal opportunity compliance, are handled out of the Office of Equity and Inclusion. \nFinally, academic affairs and awareness initiatives are overseen by the office of the Vice \nProvost for Inclusion and Community Engagement (ICE), which in turn oversees the \nuniversity’s Committee for the Status of Women (CSW), Committee for Campus \nInclusion (CCI) and various culture- and race-based faculty and staff service-based \nassociations. These committees are tasked with raising the visibility of diversity and \n8 \ninclusion efforts campus-wide through professional development workshops and \ndiversity programming.  \n Under this strategy, all departments contribute resources toward the well-being of \nall students; faculty working with LGBTQ+ students are often first-line advocates for \ntheir students, working with appropriate units or teams within EOSS to provide a chain of \nresources. Within SCE/ISE, the university’s housing or health services, for instance, key \nstaff train specifically in areas pertaining to LGBTQ+ students. These various units and \ncommittees often work in conjunction in supporting student-driven initiatives; for \ninstance, the university’s LGBTQ+ resource website is maintained by SCE/ISE in \nconjunction with CCI and the Rainbow Coalition.  \n ASU LGBTQ+ Campus Climate Survey, 2017. A recent (n=51) survey of \nLGBTQ+ undergraduate and graduate students at ASU (Reeves-Blurton, 2017) found \nthat ASU provides a reasonably safe space for LGBTQ+ students. When asked whether \nASU administration, policies and campus initiatives supported the LGBTQ+ student \ncommunity, 73% of respondents indicated they ‘somewhat agree’ or ‘agree,’ and 60% \n‘somewhat agree,’ ‘agree,’ or ‘strongly agree’ that faculty provide safe, supportive \nenvironments in the classroom, lab, and advising/learning spaces. Over 90% of \nrespondents ‘somewhat agree,’ ‘agree’, or ‘strongly agree’ that ASU’s staff and resource \noffices provide a supportive environment for LGBTQ+ students, and 80% ‘somewhat \nagree,’ ‘agree,’ or ‘strongly agree’ that overall, the institution provides a generally safe \nspace for its sexual and gender minority students.   \nThe survey also highlighted a gap, though. Of respondents, 92% indicated it is \nimportant to be connected to an LGBTQ+ community for social support, resources and \n9 \npersonal development, and 81% find LGBTQ+ community connection valuable for \nsupport in coming out and/or navigating an LGBTQ+ identity. All survey participants \nstrongly value non-sexual relationships with other LGBTQ+ students and community \nmembers. However, under 70% currently have these strong social networks, on campus \nor elsewhere. Only 30% of respondents ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ that LGBTQ+ student \nclubs and organizations have helped them better understand and navigate personal \nidentities (34% somewhat agreed), and just 43% can identify a mentor or role model to \nwhom they can look for support on LGBTQ+ identity development or interpersonal \nissues (Reeves-Blurton, 2017). It’s important to note that in an effort to reach the widest \nrange of LGBTQ+ students at the institution, and not just those affiliated with LGBTQ+ \nclubs or organizations – and therefore more comfortable or advanced in their LGBTQ+ \nidentities – the survey was specifically administered through an academic community \nrather than through EOSS channels more likely to reach students already participating in \norganized LGBTQ+ programming. \nThis study builds upon an earlier, limited study (n=12) in which 90% of \nrespondents deemed having a personal support network as ‘important’ or ‘very \nimportant’ to them, but only 50% have found support networks through university-\naffiliated organizations. Of respondents, 75% specifically desired social networking with \na larger ASU LGBTQ+ community; 25% desired support in coming out, 33% were in \nsearch of role models or mentors to aid in navigating relationship or identity issues, and \n50% wanted greater academic support specific to their LGBTQ+ identities (Reeves-\nBlurton, 2016). These surveys indicate more comprehensive, strategic efforts are needed. \nSee Appendix A for 2017 ASU Campus Climate Survey. \n10 \nLarger context: LGBTQ+ student needs and support \nThough ASU’s commitment to its LGBTQ+ student community through the \nstudent-led, staff-supported programming model has resulted in creation of opportunities \nfor its most socially engaged students, the 2016 and 2017 surveys highlight the \nproblematic nature of the institution’s lack of broader-scale resources and support for \nthese students. Multiple studies demonstrate measurable correlation between student \npersistence and success and student institutional affinity, self-efficacy, and community \nengagement (McAllister, et. al., 2009; Russell & Horne, 2009; Sanlo, 2004/2005). The \ncollege years play a critical role in the formation of adult identities, and the unique issues \nthat LGBTQ+ students face call for specific psychosocial support (Hershberger & \nD’Augelli, 1995; McAllister, et. al., 2009). Gender and sexual minority students face \nmore issues and at a higher rate than their non-LBGTQ+ peers, specifically experiencing \nhigher rates of pervasive mental problems, self-esteem issues, physical and emotional \nvictimization and family issues (Eldahan, Pachankis, Rendina, Ventuneac, Grov & \nParsons, 2016). These challenges not only leave enduring psychosocial scars and hamper \nindividual growth and development (Hershberger & D’Augelli, 1995; Ceglarek & Ward, \n2016), but have higher associated risk comorbidities such as substance use, sexual \nviolence perpetration, sexual health risk and suicidality (Eldahan, et. al., 2016; Jones & \nRaghavan, 2012). These experiences collectively correlate to academic failure and non-\nmatriculation of LGBTQ+ students (Agnelli, 2009; Kapadia, Halkiti & Barton, 2014; \nPrzedworkski, VanKim, Eisenberg, McAlpine, Lust & Laska, 2015). \n \n \n11 \nHistoric Support of LGBTQ+ Student Populations  \nThe challenges ASU experiences in serving its LGBTQ+ student population are a \npart of a larger issue in higher education and society. Research into the support of gender \nand sexual minority students in postsecondary education is still relatively young. In the \nlate 1990s, campus climate surveys reached widespread adoption as a means of assessing \nthe current state of and need for institutional support for LGBTQ+ students (Renn, 2010), \nand these early surveys indicated college environments and policies were at best ignorant \nof the challenges of LGBTQ+ students and at worst outright hostile (Hershberger & \nD’Augelli,1995; Zubernis & Snyder, 2007). As recently as 2008, only 150 out of over \n4,000 public four-year institutions in the United States offered an LGBTQ+ resource \ncenter or office (Renn, 2010). As of 2016, only 197 institutions with at least one \ndedicated 50% time employee were registered with the Consortium of Higher Education \nLGBTQ+ Resource Professionals (2016). \nChallenges to LGBTQ+ Service in the University Environment  \nPart of the issue is the invisibility of this population, both figuratively and \nstatistically. There are LGBTQ+ students who are comfortable being visible, participating \nin campus LGBTQ+ programming and assuming student leadership roles within the \nstudent governments or organizations, being a part of campus LGBTQ+ advisory or \npolicy boards, or conducting public LGBTQ+ scholarship within the institution. These \nstudents are going to self-select into the opportunities universities offer, they will benefit \nfrom them, and they will advance institutional culture and knowledge in serving students \nlike them. However, for every LGBTQ+ student confident in their identity, bravely being \nthe visible representatives of a marginalized community, there are others who struggle \n12 \nmightily with personal acceptance of their identities. Fearing discovery, particularly by \npeers and family members, these students hide any overt signs of their sexuality or \ngender identity – or deny these identities to themselves outright – masking themselves \nthrough displays of exaggerated hetero/cisnormativism such as hypergendered or \nhomophobic/transphobic behavior, or, more frequently, withdraw from social interaction \nwith their peers. Living invisibly and voicelessly at the margins of the institutional \nculture, these are the students most at risk for nonpersistence, in need of support as they \nbegin the process of reconciling an LGBTQ+ identity.   \n Even when LGBTQ+ students are visible and active within their campus \ncommunities, institutions can find it difficult to tailor programming to both student need \nand scale. Although there are an increasing number of students identifying as LGBTQ+ \non university campuses nationwide – and particularly in more liberal, progressive regions \n– few institutions have an apparatus in place to make quantifiable assessments of their \nsuccess in meeting the needs of these students (Agnelli, 2009; Renn, 2010). Unlike race, \ngender or ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity are not demographic categories \nregularly captured upon enrollment, and most universities do not know how many sexual \nor gender minority students are on their campuses. Though data suggests between 6% and \n13% of college- or near-college students nationally identify as LGBTQ+, both the \nnumber and percentage of students at any given institution remains unrecorded. As \nuniversities become increasingly data-driven, these students will remain underserved, \nunderrepresented and statistically invisible until quantifiable numbers and success \nmetrics exist.  \n \n13 \nA Call for Access at ASU \n  While statistically, although LGBTQ+ students will always remain a minority \npopulation within the institution, it’s important that it not remain an underserved or \nunderrepresented one.  Even that classification – minority student population – does a \ndisservice to this student population. If national self-reporting trends are accurate, and \nbetween 6% and 13% of ASU’s student population is a sexual and/or gender minority, \nthese students still represent a not-insignificant body of 6,000-13,000 students. ASU \ncurrently serves roughly 12,000 international students and has an average incoming class \nof just above 10,000 – and boasts substantial programming and resources in aiding the \nsuccessful transition to and retention within the institution (ASU, 2019). In order to fully \nrealize its institutional vision of inclusion and to ensure the success of this vulnerable \nstudent population, robust, strategic, and cohesive efforts not only to provide for the \nsupport of LGBTQ+ students, but to show measurable outcomes of efforts in creating \ngreater affinity, persistence and success among this student population are direly needed. \nGiven the documented challenges gender and sexual minority students face, creating \nsupportive and empowering environments is both an ethical and business imperative. \nParadoxically, while universities strive to broaden institutional appeal and demographic \ncomposition, this is often accomplished by streamlining resources – something \nnecessitated by economies of scale. ASU has implemented many initiatives benefitting \nLGBTQ+ students: gender-inclusive housing, SafeZone workshops, gender-neutral \nrestrooms, programming around diversity and inclusion in and out of the classroom, and, \nmost recently, a student-published faculty guide for working with transgender students.   \n14 \n These initiatives ensure ASU provides a safer, more inclusive environment for its \nsexual and gender minority students – but they are not enough. To allow these students to \nreach their academic and personal potentials, strategic efforts to more strongly engage \nand support the university’s LGBTQ+ students throughout their identity development and \ncoming out processes – not just specific phases of it – are essential. \nPersonal investment \n \nThe issue of LGBTQ+ student development and success is personal to me. During \nmy own undergraduate and graduate experiences, the visibility of quality programming \nand LGBTQ+ specific resources were essential to my psychosocial development. My \njourney toward recognizing and embracing an LGBTQ+ identity was a convoluted one, \nand significant parts of it are echoed by current ASU students who, twenty years later, \nhave told their stories as a part of this research project. I attended a small, rural institution \nfor my undergraduate degree in the late 1990s, before LGBTQ+ programming initiatives, \ninclusion efforts, and visibility were well established on college campuses. The university \nhad no resources dedicated to gender or sexual minority students, at least that I was aware \nof. I remember a residential campus climate that was relatively homophobic, and had no \nvisible LGBTQ+ community. With no resources I felt comfortable turning to, I did what \nmany LGBTQ+ youth, both in literature from myriad studies across the nation as well as \nthis current study, did – I suppressed any impulses to explore my sexual identity and \nmanufactured a heterosexual identity that was increasingly dissonant to my natural \nidentity. In my entire undergraduate career, I knew three LGBTQ+ people. One was a \nfaculty member. Two were students in my residence hall. One of those students was the \n15 \nsubject of homophobic taunting by peers; the other expressed aggressive and unwanted \nsexual attention toward me culminating in physical violence and forced me deeper into \nmy closet. \nThe transition to a large, culturally diverse institution for my graduate studies was \nrevelatory. The visibility of an LGBTQ+ community let me confront my sociocultural \nexpectations and identity, while university resources dedicated to LGBTQ+ identity and \ncommunity provided the resources to make a radical identity shift. Even with that \nsupport, coming out in my mid-twenties and shedding the psychosocial baggage of \nhaving so long suppressed and feared an identity was a difficult transition. Recognizing, \naccepting and embracing my sexual identity was only a small, easy step in a longer \njourney. Overcoming the prejudices and fears imprinted by those early college \nexperiences, the subsequent ‘second adolescence’ of learning and accruing the cultural \ncompetencies to enter an LGBTQ+ community, entering into romantic and sexual \nrelationships, and redefining relationships with family, friends, and an ex-wife was a \nconsuming process that nearly derailed my academic career. Without the resource of a \nvibrant and supportive LGBTQ+ community, it likely would have done so. \nAs a student affairs professional, I am a passionate advocate for my university’s \nLGBTQ+ community. I’ve experienced firsthand the potential both for damage in a lack \nof institutional support for gender and sexual minority college students and for the \nmyriad benefits of a strong LGBTQ+ engagement model.  As a member of the leadership \nteams of ASU’s Committee for Campus Inclusion and its new LGBTQ+ Faculty/Staff \nAssociation, I have worked with ASU’s gender and sexual minority communities to \ncreate and raise the visibility of programming, resources and opportunities to facilitate \n16 \nstronger, more successful experiences for the university’s LGBTQ+ students. My \npersonal story, or some derivation of it, is still entirely too common within higher \neducation. The narratives of loneliness, confusion, and adversity that were common \ntropes among the interviews collected for this project are saddening and frustrating. At \nthe same time, counternarratives of personal growth, resilience and success among these \nsame students fill me with inspiration and pride in what these students and the institution \ncan accomplish. It’s my hope that in taking the pulse of the resource and community-\ndevelopment needs of these students and creating structures to mitigate the challenges \nfaced by them as they navigate their identities and sociocultural ecosystems, this \ninstitution can help create a different storyline for a new generation of LGBTQ+ students. \nResearch proposal and research questions \n \nA common theme has emerged in researching and developing ways to better \nconnect LGBTQ+ students to ASU and support their psychosocial needs: although ASU \npromotes and creates cultural enrichment and student leadership opportunities for its \nLGBTQ+ students, it does too little to foster connection for those most in need of support \nor to create a sense of safe space and community. LGBTQ+ students look to the \nuniversity’s faculty, staff and administration to create and sustain a space in which they \ncan grow and flourish as a community, and ASU’s lack of an LGBTQ+ center or resource \nhub is viewed at best as a missed opportunity and at worst a disservice by many of the \nLGBTQ+ students, both undergraduate and graduate, I’ve interacted with in the various \nphases of this research study. While appreciative of the programming offered through \n17 \nSCE/ISE and the support they received from faculty, staff, and the general university \ncommunity, there is a pervasive sense that more can and should be done. \nThis study aims to develop, implement and evaluate an LGBTQ+ student \nmentoring program providing psychosocial support and resilience development and \npromoting both LGBTQ+ individual and community identity development and affinity. \nThe following research questions will frame and drive data collection and analysis:  \n(RQ1): What does the process of LGBTQ+ identity construction look like for \ngender- and sexual-minority students, including students from non-dominant \ncultural backgrounds for whom LGBTQ+ identity is one of multiple competing \nidentities, and how does mentorship influence the perceived identities of these \nstudents?  \n \n(RQ2): How does participation in an LGBTQ+ mentoring program influence \nparticipants’ perceptions of development of resilience-building capacity? \n18 \nCHAPTER 2 \nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS AND LITERATURE REVIEW \nBrave New World: Pioneering a Field \n \n With a recent national spotlight on LGBTQ+ rights, studies into the needs of \nsexual- and gender-minority students in higher education have surged. With nationwide \nconversations around same-sex marriage and protections spreading a ripple of hope \namongst both LGBTQ+ citizens and allies alike, recognition of the LGBTQ+ community \nappeared on the ascent. However, amidst these victories for this community have been \ntrials, too – most recently controversial legislation to limit the adoptive rights of same-sex \ncouples and rescindment of the right of transgendered citizens to serve in the military. \nGiven the turbulent sociopolitical climate in which the LGBTQ+ community is \nembroiled, research and advocacy into both the psychosocial support and academic \nsuccess of sexual and gender minority students are particularly relevant. The myriad \nchallenges facing this population have been well documented, but explanatory theory and \nsolutions-based scholarship have been limited.  \n Before 1995, most research dedicated to LGBTQ+ populations addressed \npsychosocial and identity development or were clinical or behavioral assessments \nfocusing on diagnostic and treatment protocols from a psychological, deficit-based lens \nrather than an asset-focused sociological one. Few addressed sexual minority students \nand their inclusion and success in higher education; gender minority populations – not \nonly transgender students, but gender-nonconforming and nonbinary students too – were \npractically ignored. In the past decade, LGBTQ+ scholarship has grown, building upon \n19 \npioneering LGBTQ+ identity development research by Cass (1979) on the psychosocial \nprocesses and needs of gender- and (later) sexual-minority youth. D’Augelli (1995) and \nMcCarn and Fassinger (1996), in particular, incorporated gender and sexual minority \nidentity development into a larger framework for university student success. Recent \nresearch has sought to understand LGBTQ+ student success through the lenses of identity \ntheory, minority stress, and the connection between cultural capital and resilience. \nCoupled with the strides in representation and equality within the university and larger \npublic sphere, the mechanisms needed to support this population are increasingly \nunderstood.  \n Reviewing past research on the cultural milieu in which LGBTQ+ support arose \nand on early identity development theory is instrumental to understanding the barriers \nremaining to this population. The connection between discrimination, victimization and \nthe physical and psychological challenges facing these students paint a vivid image of \nwhy they remain at risk of failure within a university environment. Finally, recent \nscholarship on resilience factors and student development theory associated with known \nLGBTQ+ student stressors suggests strategic and specific next steps in aiding the support \nand success of these students at Arizona State University. \n \nHistoric Barriers to LGBTQ+ Social Adaptation and Success: Mental Health, \nVictimization, Marginalization \n \nDiscrimination and Victimization  \nGender and sexual minority youth have disproportionately experienced \ndiscrimination and victimization directly related to their LGBTQ+ status. In a study \n20 \nspanning the mid-1990s and encompassing several hundred sexual minority youth from \nfourteen metropolitan areas, researchers discovered these students to be among the most \nvulnerable within the university setting (Hershberger & D’Augelli, 1995). Over 40% of \nstudy participants reported experiencing physical, emotional or verbal abuse due to their \nsexual orientation or gender identity, and the stress of these experiences led to substantive \nand often long-lasting mental health issues (1995).  \n More recently, Williams, Connolly, Pepler and Craig (2005) found peer \nvictimization to have a stronger impact on depression and externalized comorbid \nsymptoms (substance abuse, sexual risk behaviors, intimate partner violence \nvictimization) than even internalized homonegativity or identity distress. Edwards and \nSylaska (2013;), Williams, Connolly, Pepler and Craig (2005) and others have found that \nupward of 70% of LGBTQ+ college students have experienced direct physical or verbal \nassault specifically motivated by their sexual orientation or gender expression, while \nRankin (2005) discovered that over 50% were ‘closeted’ in an effort to avoid anti-\nLGBTQ+ aggression. In Rankin’s study, 20% of participants feared for their physical \nsafety, and nearly 30% indicated discomfort with their campus environments.   \nDepression and Mental Health  \nAs early as the 1980s and 1990s, multiple studies have found incidents of \nsuicidality in LGBTQ+ youth aged 18-24 significantly higher than those of heterosexual \npeers (Gibson, 1989; Harry, 1989). Upwards of 30% of completed suicides among youth \naged 15-21 were gender or sexual minority youth, and Gibson and Harry speculated \nbetween 30% to 35% of all LGBTQ+ youth of the era had attempted suicide (Gibson, \n1989; Savin-Williams, 1994).  Meanwhile, Hatzenbuehler, Corbin and Fromme (2011), \n21 \nMaggs, Steinman and Zucker (2001), and Russell and Joyner (2001) found gender and \nsexual minority youth are twice as likely to attempt suicide as their peers. Goldbach \n(2017) and Mashal, et. al., (2011) revealed that LGBTQ+ youth are three times more \nlikely to report a history of suicidal thought and five times more likely to have attempted \nsuicide than their heterosexual peers.  Eisenberg and Resnick (2006) note 48% of \nLGBTQ+ youth considering suicide indicated a correlation to their gender or sexual \nidentity. As far back as 1994, Savin-Williams issued the bold and startling revelation that \nsuicide is the leading cause of death among sexual-minority youth.  \nLiterature spanning the 2000s by Edwards and Sylaska (2013), Eldahan et.al. \n(2016), Hefner and Eisenberg (2009) and Sanlo (2004/2005) suggests gender and sexual \nminority college students remain not only are at higher risk of developing mental health \nproblems, but experience more acute levels of psychological distress than other student \npopulations. Ceglarek argues that these students report overall worse mental health and \n“higher levels of loneliness, anxiety, depressive symptoms, hostility, and sensitivity in \ncomparison with their heterosexual peers” (2016, p. 206). Eldahan et. al. (2016) and \nSanlo (2004/2005) specifically cite  mood, eating/body image, low self-esteem, feelings \nof alienation, isolation and invisibility, and anxiety disorders as mental health challenges \nendemic to this population. Savin-Williams (1994), a late-twentieth-century \ndevelopmental psychologist specializing in LGBTQ+ populations, noted these students \nface greater difficulty in emotional and behavioral adjustment difficulties than their peers, \nan observations reiterated by Williams, et. al. (2005) a decade later.  \nMore disturbingly, Edwards and Sylaska (2013) revealed that these statistics have \na well-documented correlation to significant, lasting, and debilitating behavioral \n22 \ncomorbidity, a claim echoed by Eldahan, et. al., (2016), Livingston, Christianson and \nCochran (2016), and Woodword and Kulick (2015). Although LGBTQ+ students face \ndisproportionate rates of poor mental health, significant knowledge gaps exist in the \npsychological literature, and the full extent of effects remains undocumented, as pointed \nout by Przedworski, et. al., (2015), Rankin (2005), and Woodford and Kulick (2015). In a \nstudy of 34,000 students at 40 institutions, LGBTQ+ students reported issues ranging \nfrom depression and anxiety to post-traumatic stress, social phobia, and self-image \nproblems stemming from internalized homophobia. In one study, Przedworkski, et. al. \n(2015) note that one third and one fifth of college-age women and men, respectively, \nreported these barriers. Studies by Rosario, et. al., (2014), Hatzenbuehler (2009), \nZubernis and Snyder (2007), and Woodford and Kulick (2015) have all found self-\ndestructive behaviors such as substance abuse and failed relationships to be common and \nlinked to gender or sexual minority status and associated stressors.  \nAlcohol and Drug Use/abuse  \nLGBTQ+ youth also experience high substance use rates compared to their peers. \nData presented by Talley, et. al. (2016) suggests college-going gender/sexual minority \nyouth with better resolved LGBTQ+ identities show greater resilience and have lower \nalcohol and drug use than their gender or sexual minority peers or students with lesser-\nresolved identities. However, reports by Adams, Knopf and Park (2014) and Livingston, \nChristianson and Cochran (2016) indicate that despite this, overall use of alcohol, \nnicotine, and other drugs and substances remains substantially higher than those among \nother college student demographics. Mashal, et. al. (2008) found gender and sexual \nminority youth are 190% more likely to disclose a history of substance use or abuse than \n23 \ntheir peers, while Talley, et. al. (2016) found alcohol use rates among bisexual and \ngender-minority students were particularly high – perhaps an indicator of the unique \nchallenges faced by these populations in finding commonality even within the larger gay \nand lesbian communities. Mereish, et. al., (2017), correlate lifetime tobacco use in \nLGBTQ+ students to homophobic bullying, concluding that permissive social norms and \nmaladaptive coping processes to external and internal LGBTQ+ related stressors were \nresponsible for these statistics. In other words, with gender and sexual minority youth \nmore likely to witness substance use within their peer groups as a means of coping with \nLGBTQ+ related micro- and macroaggressions and challenges, they, accordingly, turn to \nthese strategies.  According to studies by Eldahan, et. al. (2016) and Lewis, et. al. (2012), \nthis subsequently increases the incidence of other risk factors, including unsafe sexual \npractices and perpetuation of/victimization by same-sex partner violence.  \nIntimate Partner Violence Victimization  \nResearch indicates that the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ students do not only \ncome from outside their communities. As D’Augelli (1992), Edwards and Sylaska \n(2013), Jones and Raghavan (2012) and Porter and Williams (2011) have all noted, \nsexual and gender minority college students experience higher rates of physical, sexual, \nand psychological partner violence victimization than their peers, in part due to the higher \nrates of alcohol and substance use noted above. According to both Edwards and Sylaska \n(2013) and Jones and Raghavan (2012), over 40% of LGBTQ+ college students have \nreported dating violence perpetrated against them within the past year. In a recent study \ninto identity-related psychological trauma, Edwards and Sylaska (2013), suggest \ncorrelations exist between same-sex intimate partner violence and identity-based \n24 \nstressors, with internalized homonegativity/homophobia being the “most salient” stress \ncorrelate (p. 1728).  \nTheoretical Perspectives: LGBTQ+ Identity Development, Minority Stress, Cultural \nCapital and LGBTQ+ Community Support Resilience \n \n Persisting challenges facing gender and sexual minority students are attributed to \nthree primary factors: lack of a salient LGBTQ+ identity and stunted interpersonal \ndevelopment; minority stress compounded by identity confusion; and lack of personal \nresilience. \nIdentity Salience and Discord  \nAlthough a full examination of identity development is far beyond the scope of \nthis present study, some conceptual understanding of identity and its centrality to self-\nconcept are crucial to understanding the challenges faced by gender and sexual minority \ncommunities. One of identity theory’s earliest proponents, George Herbert Mead, posited \nthat identity is based on “symbolic interactionism” and that taking a “situated identity \nperspective” is essential to navigating a complex social life (Mead, 1934, qtd. in Stryker \n& Burke, 2000).  According to Mead’s formulation of identity, society shapes the \nindividual, and therefore social behavior. Building on this work, Stryker and Burke \n(2000) define identity as the “parts of a self composed of the meanings that persona \nattach to the multiple roles they typically play in highly differentiated contemporary \nsocieties” (p. 284). They elaborate: \nsociety is seen as a mosaic of relatively durable patterned interactions and \nrelationships, differentiated yet organized, embedded in an array of groups, \norganizations, communities, and institutions, and intersected by crosscutting \nboundaries of class, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, and other variables. (p. 285-\n86)  \n25 \n \nIdentity is thus a person’s internalized role expectations, and it is primary to individual \nsense-making of the world. A tenet of identity theory is that as the individual encounters \nand processes various social interactions, a shifting of roles and associated expectations \noccurs until such time that a salient or dominant identity emerges. At this time, identity \nstability across time and situations may occur (Stryker & Burke, 2000). In terms of \nLGBTQ+ identity development specifically, Hu and Wang (2013) note that “an \nindividual’s sexual identity is constructed by negotiating the self with the specific social \nand cultural contexts within which they reside” (p. 669). \n For the purposes of this study, the concept of internalized role expectation as a \nfunction of external influences that is most important. In a pioneering early study, \nHershberger and D’Augelli (1995) argued the college-going years to be among the most \ncrucial to gender and sexual minority students in establishing identity and are particularly \ncritical to formation and integration of lifelong psychosocial, personal and cognitive \nidentities, findings later reaffirmed by Bilodeau and Renn (2005), Kapadia, et. al., (2014), \nWoodford and Kulick (2015), and Sanlo (2005). On entering the university, students \ninstinctively seek relationships within peer groups or student organizations reinforcing or \nproviding affinity with their emerging salient identities and associated beliefs (Serpe & \nStryker, 1987). Burke (1987 and 1991) notes that this shared meaning informs beliefs, \nattitudes, and self-expectation, and comparison of their own beliefs and values to a \nperceived identity standard sets the tone for students’ interactions and behavior. For \nLGBTQ+ students, this can be a perilous time: upon entering a heteronormative \nenvironment in which their developing identities do not align with those of their peers, \n26 \nstudents navigating gender and/or sexual minority status experience cognitive dissonance, \nrelational mis-match and identity discord (Carver & Scheier, 1990; Burke & Stets). As \nstudents experience this discord, many internalize feelings of difference through \ninternalized heterosexism and homophobia, attempting to conceal their increasingly \ndivergent identities and normalizing the developmental trajectories of their peers at the \nexpense of their own. \n As research by Bauermeister, et. al. (2010) and Bos, et. al. (2008) has discovered, \nstudents who attempt appropriation of heteronormative or ‘straight-acting’ identities as a \nmeans of minority identity concealment (colloquially called ‘passing’) often fail to \ndevelop a healthy LGBTQ+ identity and positive self-concept. Research by Zubernis and \nSnyder (2007) and Przedworkski, et. al. (2015) confirms that persisting in an identity-\nconfused state results in loneliness and alienation, leaving these students vulnerable to \nminority stress and more impacted by challenging life events. Woodford and Kulick \n(2015) note that if unable to reconcile their sexual or gender identities, these students \nultimately experience poorer academic success and higher incidents of non-persistence, \nconfirming earlier studies by Tinto (1993) and Silverschanz, et. al., (2008).  \nLGBTQ+ Identity Models  \nOver the decades, social scientists have worked to understand the identity \ndevelopmental pathways for sexual and gender minority populations. Since the 1970’s \nthree models in particular have attracted attention and remain most prevalent in student \ndevelopment: Cass’s Gay and Lesbian Sexual Identity Formation model, McCarn and \nFassinger’s Lesbian Sexual Identity Formation model, and D’Augelli’s LGBT Life Span \nIdentity model.  \n27 \n A pioneer in LGBTQ+ studies whose publication of the first model of \nhomosexual identity formation became the standard framework from which subsequent \nmodels have either developed or diverged, Cass originally identified six unique \ndevelopmental stages of homosexual development. Originally created to explain the \ndevelopmental trajectories of lesbian women, Cass’s framework has since been adapted \nto larger LGBTQ+ populations. As Degges-White, Rice, and Myers (2000) note, it is a \nclassic text in LGBTQ+ identity for its comprehension and sophistication. As Bilodeau \nand Renn (2005) note, Cass explained the emotional development issues often seen in \ngay and lesbian youth as a result of identity ambiguity, arguing that an initial rejection of \na homosexual identity is a challenge to identity salience all sexual minority youth must \nresolve. In proposing a phase-based Gay and Lesbian Sexual Identity Formation model \n(1979, 1996), she was the first to link LGBTQ+ identity to a developmental process \n(Gervacio, 2012). Presenting six distinct linear stages of progressive homosexual identity \nacquisition and normalization (identity confusion, comparison, tolerance, acceptance, \npride and synthesis), Cass articulates the centrality of “the interaction process that occurs \nbetween individuals and their environments” to the emergence of a salient sexual-\nminority identity (1979, p. 219). Central to Cass’s framework is the assumption of \nidentity discord and that sexual-minority individuals view themselves initially from the \nperspective of the identity standard: that they are “supposed to be \nheterosexual…understand that heterosexuality is desirable and acceptable and \nhomosexuality is stigmatized and has minority status” (1996, p. 222). For a full \ndescription of Cass’s Lesbian and Gay Sexual Identity Formation model, see Appendix \nB. \n28 \n More recently, D’Augelli (1994, 1995) and McCarn and Fassinger (1996, 1998) \nproposed that rather than developmental stages, LGBTQ+ identity consists of milestones \nattained at various stages of identity development (Gervacio, 2012). These phases need \nnot follow a sequential order. Both D’Augelli and McCarn and Fassinger’s models were \nbetter suited to more integrative approaches to sexual orientation/identity and gender \nidentity/expression than Cass’s (Anderson-Martinez & Vianden, 2014; Bilodeau & Renn, \n2005; Levy, 2009). Newer phase models also better account for the individual and \ncultural differences experienced by LGBTQ+ students from non-Western societies, \naccording to Hu and Wang (2013), making it easier to capture the unique individual \nexperiences related to LGBTQ+ identification. While McCarn and Fassinger initially \ncreated their model to explain lesbian identity development, they later found empirical \nsupport that the model applied to gay and bisexual populations as well (Gervacio, 2012). \nD’Augelli’s model, initially applied to lesbian, gay and bisexual populations, was later \nadapted to include gender-minority (transgender and gender-nonbinary) populations \n(Bilodeau, 2008). McCarn, Fassinger and D’Augelli also expanded Cass’s research by \nplacing gender- and sexual-minority development in context of prevalent student identity \ntheory (Bilodeau, 2008; Gervacio, 2012), and most specifically Chickering’s Theory of \nStudent Identity Development (see Appendix C).  \n While Cass identifies the (heteronormative) social environment as a challenge to \nsexual minority students in attaining identity salience, Anderson-Martin and Vianden \n(2014), Bilodeau and Renn (2005), and Levy (2009) note that both the McCarn-Fassinger \nand D’Augelli models acknowledge the importance of social environments and group \naffinity in development of sexual minority identities. The McCarn-Fassinger’s Lesbian \n29 \nSexual Identity Formation model articulates four phases (awareness, exploration, \ndeepening/commitment, internalization/synthesis) to describe separate but parallel \npathways of individual and social identity development formation (2012), indicating that \nboth individual and interpersonal identity development may occur either separately or in \ntandem. For a full description of the McCarn-Fassinger’s Lesbian Sexual Identity \nFormation model, see Appendix D. \n Like McCarn and Fassinger’s work, D’Augelli’s LGBT Life Span Identity model \ngoes a step further than the Mc-Carn-Fassinger, proposing a synthesis of individual and \nsocial identity formation. He argues both are equally essential in adopting an LGBTQ+ \nidentity, and one cannot occur without equal development of the other. In his framework, \nD’Augelli identified six developmental stages: exiting heterosexuality; developing a \npersonal LGB identity; developing a social LGB social identity; becoming an LGB \noffspring; developing and LGB intimacy status; and entering an LGB community (1995). \nAs Anderson-Martin (2014), Bilodeau and Renn (2005) note, aside from including social \ninteraction and structures in the development of an LGB identity, D’Augelli’s model is \nnoteworthy in describing the six areas of psychosocial development as not only non-\nsequential, but simultaneous and overlapping. Stevens (2004) adds that D’Augelli’s \nmodel demonstrates the importance of developmental elasticity, explaining that each \nperson’s journey to self-acceptance is uniquely informed by both environmental factors \nand individual differences. As Dziengel (2015) and Levy (2009) note, regression or \nidentity foreclosure (the inability to attain a salient LGBTQ+ identity) can still occur, but \nthe reasons for these regressions are framed more clearly in terms of sociocultural \ncontext, expectation and an ecological systems view of the person in his or her \n30 \nenvironment than in either the Cass or McCarn-Fassinger models. Because of this \nnuance, and because it its alignment specifically with student development theory, \nD’Augelli’s model is among the most useful within the university context. For a full \ndescription of D’Augelli’s LGBT Life Span Identity model, see Appendix E. \nMinority Stress \nDespite their divergent approaches, the identity models of Cass, McCarn and \nFassinger, and D’Augelli share one common element: that a lack of development or \nidentity foreclosure can have catastrophic effects on the psychological development of \nLGBTQ+ individuals.  What these models do not explain, though, is the connection \nbetween identity foreclosure and the mental health problems and related contributing \nfactors such as sexual risk-taking, substance abuse, and partner violence \nperpetration/victimization that disproportionately burden gender and sexual minority \nindividuals. Minority stress theory, first articulated by Meyer (2003), suggests \nenvironmental circumstances and minority status are connected. As Goldbach, et. al. \n(2017) note, everyday challenges may be magnified by the unique stressors, such as \ndiscrimination, microaggressions and victimization, faced by minority groups. Over the \npast decade, a significant body of research by Edwards and Sylaska (2013), Eldahan, et. \nal. (2016), Goldbach and Gibbs (2017), Livingston, Christianson and Cochran (2017), \nMereish, et. al. (2017) and others identifies minority stress as the most likely explanatory \nmodel for the collective “unique and chronic psychosocial stressors” that affect and \ncontribute to the negative mental health and behavioral outcomes of gender and sexual \nminority youth. \n31 \n In a thirty-day study of gay and bisexual men, Eldahan, et. al., (2016) found \nminority stress-related triggers predicted higher rates of negative affect emotions (fear, \nsadness) and anxiety. Lewis, et. al. (2012) suggest minority stress is a primary cause of \ngender and sexual minority risk-taking behaviors, including substance use/abuse, and \nsubsequently increases risk for perpetration/victimization of intimate partner violence and \nunsafe sexual practices. According to Gibbs and Rice (2016) and Goldbach and Gibbs \n(2017), minority stress experienced during the formative adolescence and the early adult \nyears, while sexual and gender identities are becoming salient and identity development \nis a central task (Erikson, 1968), can have effects on mental health that endure well into \nadulthood. \n \nSupporting LGBTQ+ Students in Higher Education: Resilience, Cultural Capital, \nand Community Support \n \nResilience  \nWhile lack of identity salience and minority stress can have deleterious effects on \ngender and sexual minority college students, fostering resilience through development of \ncultural identity capital can provide buffering factors and mitigate associated negative \nhealth and behavioral outcomes: in other words, LGBTQ+ students with stronger \nresilience factors (self-efficacy, positive self-concept, and a sense of connection to their \nLGBTQ+ community) are less likely to be affected by environmental stressors (Huang \nand Lin, 2013). In recent years, resilience theory has been increasingly used to explore \nthe challenges and outcomes of underrepresented minority populations (see Sanlo, 2004 \nand Nicolazzo, 2016), and is a powerful lens through which to examine the challenges \nand successes of gender and sexual minority students.  \n32 \n Defined as the “positive capacity of people to cope with stress and adversity” by \nHuang and Lin (2013), resilience “allow[s] a person to retain emotional health and \nachieve goals in the face of adversity” (Huang & Lin, 2013; Schoon, 2006; Ungar, 2008). \nHuang and Lin’s assessment of resilience supports previous scholarship by Schoon \n(2006) and Ungar (2008), asserting that individuals with greater resilience are more \ncapable of responding actively and positively to life situations, stress and trauma.   \n In multiple studies involving LGBTQ+ populations and minority stress, resilience \nhas demonstrably mitigated stressors. Livingston, Christianson and Cochran (2016) \ndiscovered a causal link between resiliency-based conditioning, minority stress and \nalcohol use/abuse rates among LGBTQ+ youth; in this study students who exhibited \nstronger resiliency-adjacent personality traits (extraversion, conscientiousness, \nagreeability) were less likely to use/abuse alcohol. In a study simulating the effects of \nprotective factors such as increased social interaction and the influence of positive \nLGBTQ+ role models, Eisenberg and Resnick (2006) discovered that the addition of \nthese factors to a suicide-prediction model decreased expected suicide ideation and \nattempts by nearly 6% or 12,000 deaths by suicide annually. Meanwhile, research by \nHefner and Eisenberg (2009), Huang and Lin (2013), Ward Struthers, Perry, and Menec \n(2000) all attribute a lack of resilience to poor mental health, higher \ncomorbid/maladaptive behavior rates, and, therefore, among college-going populations, \ngreater risk of academic failure. \n Over the past decade, studies by Hatzenbuehler (2011), Buameister, et. al. (2008), \nand Peplau and Fingerhut (2007) have specifically identified social support, LGBTQ+ \nrelationship-building, and development of interpersonal ties as critical to resilience-\n33 \nbuilding and as primary protective factors against minority stress. Meanwhile, Hefner and \nEisenberg (2009), Woodford and Kulick (2015) and Sanlo (2004/2005) have established \nthat bolstering social support provides psychosocial coping resources in short-circuiting \nthe development of mental health problems and replacing maladaptive coping measures \nsuch as substance use/abuse among minority-population college students. Specifically, \nnote Hefter and Eisenberg (2009), strong social connection and support positively affect \nself-esteem, self-efficacy, and buffer against socioenvironmental stresses. Nicolazzo \n(2016) notes that on university campuses and other traditionally hetero- and cis-\nnormative spaces, establishment of ‘kinship networks’ (Nicolazzo, 2016) allows gender \nand sexual minority students to create spaces and communities in which to build and \nreinforce their own identities.  Eldahan, et. al., note: \n[T]hey [minority stressors] are interrupted (moderated) by (a) the presence of \ncoping and social supports including group solidarity, enhanced in-group identity, \nand affirming communities; and (b) the characteristics of the minority identity, \nwhich include how prominent and important the minority identity is to the \nparticipant. (2016, p. 38) \n \nFinally, research by Woodford and Kulick (2015) and Reed, et. al. (2010) suggests causal \nlinks between community network support, perception of campus climate and substance \nuse among LGBTQ+ college students, while Talley, et. al. (2016) discovered that \nstudents demonstrating higher group affinity are less likely to use/abuse substances in \norder to mitigate minority stress. \nSocial Connection and Cultural Capital  \nBuilding on earlier studies examining the connection between minority stress, \nidentity and resilience, Ceglarek and Ward (2016), and Masten, Herbers and Reed (2009) \n34 \nclaim that connection to a larger LGBTQ+ community is integral to the development of \nresilience and essential to the development of a salient LGBTQ+ identity, while \nSlootmaeckers and Lievens (2014) found that cultural capital can specifically mitigate \nexperience of homonegativity in LGBTQ+ populations. Resilience, identity salience and \ncultural capital, in turn, are instrumental to the success of gender and sexual minority \nstudents. However, as early as the 1990s, studies by Savin-Williams (1990) and \nD’Augelli) demonstrated that many LGBTQ+ youth, including college students, have \neither insufficient or unstable support networks. \n Lack of community belonging, affinity and connection has historically been a \nproblem facing gender and sexual minority populations.  Cass (1979/1996), Gervacio \n(2012), and McCarn and Fassinger (1996) note that particularly during the adolescent \nyears when lifelong identities are being negotiated, gender and sexual minority youth \nface confusion as they grapple with an emerging identity outside their peers’ norm. The \n‘coming out’ process, through which sexual and gender minority students discover their \ntrue identities, is marked by turmoil, conflict and reevaluation, as well as comparison \nagainst their peers and long-held personal, familial and societal assumptions. This \nprocess culminates in either nonacceptance (Cass’s identity foreclosure) or acceptance, \nidentity synthesis, and entrance into a larger LGBTQ+ community. More recently, \nCeglarek and Ward (2016) have noted that during this period, the creation of alternate \nsocial interactions and community allow for identity exploration, acculturation into an \nLGBTQ+ community, and identity affirmation and support.  \n Hershberger and D’Augelli (1994, 1995) determined strong support networks and \nself-acceptance were the strongest variables in moderating and mediating the effect of \n35 \nvictimization on LGBTQ+ individuals insofar as mental health and suicidality. \nSubsequent studies by Kapadia, et. al. (2014), MacAllister, et. al. (2009), Pryor (2015), \nSheran and Arnold (2012), Woodford and Kulick (2015) and Tinto (1993) have \ndemonstrably correlated  greater self-efficacy among college-age LGBTQ+ students with \nbetter success in navigating barriers among students with strong social support networks. \nThis demonstrates the importance of peer groups, campus climate, and faculty interaction \nin identity development and college success and the role of mentorship and significant-\nother support and affinity-building in the fostering and development of a positive \nLGBTQ+ identity. Tinto (1993) identified social isolation as a primary cause of student \nretention problems, while Sanlo (2004/2005, p. 97) noted that students lacking peer \nkinship and exposed to an unsupportive environment and/or harassment “are unable to \nfocus on either academic or co-curricular learning.”  \n More explicitly, Woodford and Kulick (2015) and Silverschanz, et. al. (2008) \ndiscovered that for gender and sexual minority students lacking resilience-bolstering \ncommunities and social support, minority stressors (and specifically bullying, perceived \nheterosexist/homonegative campus environments, verbal harassment, and family issues) \ncorrelate to increased chances of academic failure and non-matriculation. Chickering & \nReisser (1993) argue navigating identity can come at the expense of other important \ndevelopmental milestones for LGBTQ+ students; Fine (2016) noted students navigating a \ngender or sexual minority identity without resilience-bolstering mechanisms often have to \nchoose between navigating that identity or navigating an academic career, but rarely \nsucceed at both simultaneously. Fine (2016) notes that in one study, over 50% of LGB \nparticipants left their university at least temporarily, with two-thirds citing lack of \n36 \nfamilial or peer support or a hostile campus environment as their primary reason for non-\ncompletion. In another, Sanlo (2004/2005) notes that 31% left for at least one semester or \ntransferred to another institution, and 33% dropped out completely, citing campus \nharassment as a primary reason. These rates are corroborated in studies by Rankin, et. al. \n(2010) and Woodford and Kulick (2014), who note that 30% of respondents reported \ncampus climate problems made them reconsider their enrollment at their institutions.  \nLGBTQ+ Student Identity and Mentorship  \nWith these issues rooted in the students’ psychosocial development, universities \ncan mitigate these challenges by providing proper support and community building, as \ndemonstrated initially by Tinto (1993) and more recently by MacAllister, et. al. (2009), \nPryor (2015), Woodford and Kulick (2015), and others. If alienation is a significant factor \nin LGBTQ+ student failure, student success can be greatly improved by involvement \nwithin a familiar community offering role modeling and psychosocial support. \n An increasing number of studies, including those of Kim and Sax (2009), \nSilverschanz, et. al. (2008), and Hurtado, et. al. (2008), demonstrate that robust faculty, \nstaff, and peer group interaction are essential to the resilience and persistence of minority \nstudent groups. These dynamics positively correlate to social acceptance, academic \nengagement, and buffering against both external homonegativity (anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs, \nattitudes and judgments) and internalized homophobia (emotional response or distress). \nOn the other hand, Dziengel (2015) notes, students missing these supports fail to develop \nthe robust psychological toolkits and salient LGBTQ+ identities not only required for \n37 \nuniversity persistence, but may develop psychosocial developmental issues that will \ncontinue manifesting into adulthood if unaddressed during these formative years.  \nMacAllister, et. al. (2009), Russell and Horne (2009) and Sheran and Arnold \n(2012) identify mentorship as specifically beneficial to sexual and gender minority \nstudents, as they benefit from the role modeling and common meaning-making of \ncommunity-building, ultimately demonstrating increased academic persistence and \nsuccess. The earliest studies on LGBTQ+ student mentorship appear in the late 1990s, \nwhen Lark and Croteau (1998) published faculty guidelines for mentoring LGBTQ+ \ndoctoral students.  \nEven these guidelines, though, were established to aid non-LGBTQ+ faculty in \nrelating to and mentoring LGBTQ+ students. During this era, Lark and Croteau note that \nmany gender and sexual minority faculty and staff were reluctant to disclose their own \nidentities and take active roles in the LGBTQ+ student community for fear of \ninstitutional reprisal. While the programs were designed to create safe spaces for \ndisclosure and discussion for students, a lack of mentors who, as part of the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity, shared a common identity and cultural framework as the students, limited the \nsuccess of these early programs. As Renn (2010) notes, these programs precluded \ngenuine community-building; while mentors could sympathize with the challenges many \nLGBTQ+ students face in their environments, they could not empathize because they did \nnot have experiences directly correlating to the unique challenges common to the \nLGBTQ+ experience. As MacAllister, et. al. (2009) and Miller (2015) have discussed, \nmentee satisfaction is greater with mentors whom they perceive greater homophily \n(greater similarity; i.e., members of the LGBTQ+ community). In studies of programs \n38 \nwhere both mentor and mentee shared a sexual or gender identity, students were more \nlikely to remain engaged with both the mentorship program and the institution. \nUltimately, mentoring programs to increase LGBTQ+ student connection, group \naffinity and identity development hold promise in transforming the way universities \ninteract with – and retain – gender and sexual minority students. As MacAllister, et. al., \nand Russell and Horne (2009) observe, this has not always been possible. It’s only in \nrecent years, with the increased visibility of LGBTQ+ role models on college campuses \ndue to changing sociocultural norms, that new opportunities for multi-generational \ngender and sexual minority mentoring has become possible. Within Western societies and \nthe American university system specifically, views on the LGBTQ+ community have \nbegun shifting in a positive direction in the past decade. With an increasing number of \nstates (and, in the case of ASU, institutions even without larger state mandate) protecting \nLGBTQ+ community members against workplace and employment discrimination \n(Freedom For All Americans, 2019),faculty and staff are increasingly comfortable \ncoming out and less stigmatized in the university environment, and students therefore \nhave more visible role models within the institution – and are persisting and thriving to a \ngreater extent than ever before. Sheran and Arnold (2012) note that sexual and gender \nminority students engaged in mentoring with LGBTQ+ mentors, whether they be other \nstudents, faculty or staff, report lower levels and occurrences of anxiety and depression, \nmore positive relationships with their universities, and increased academic persistence. \nStevens (2004) and Vaccaro (2012) correlate these changes to increased self-acceptance \nand assumption of more positive LGBTQ+ identities associated with the shared lived \nidentities of these students and their newly-expanded community networks. Woodford \n39 \nand Kulick (2015) argue that programs increasing the visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals, \noffering safe spaces and opportunities to address heterosexism, homonegativity and \nhomophobia, and positive measures for coping with minority stress correlate to greater \nsocial integration and increased educational success and persistence outcomes for the \nstudents involved with them.  \nSummary: Theoretical Perspectives in Context \n \n Although the past decades have seen momentum in sexual and gender minority \nadvocacy, work remains in making universities truly productive and inclusive \nenvironments for LGBTQ+ students. When considered in tandem with intersecting racial, \nsocio-economic, gender and spiritual identities, Kapadia, et. al. (2014), Silverschanz, et. \nal., and Woodford and Kulick (2015) note that gender and sexual minority college \nstudents continue to face more educational attainment challenges than any other student \ngroup. Among the most pressing barriers are identity-related emotional challenges and \nemotional and physical obstacles related to developing and maintaining LGBTQ+ \nidentities in traditionally cis- and heteronormative campus environments. Within the \numbrella of sexual and gender minority populations, both research and anecdotal data \nindicate that transgender, gender-nonconforming/nonbinary, and bisexual student \npopulations continue to encounter significant challenges (Bilodeau, 2008; Mashal, et. al., \nPryor, 2015; Talley, 2016). \n In combination with more recent scholarship by Bilodeau (2005, 2008), Renn \n(2005, 2010), Sanlo (2005) and Vaccaro (2009) on how identity, educational investment \nand attainment connect, the foundational identity development frameworks of D’Augelli  \n40 \n(1995) and McCarn and Fassinger (1996) provide a theoretical lens through which to \nexamine the psychosocial development and retention issues unique to LGBTQ+ student \npopulations. Pioneering LGBTQ+ mentoring efforts by Lark and Croteau (1998), \nMacAllister, et. al. (2009); Russell and Horne (2009), and Sheran and Arnold (2012) \nestablished a preliminary baseline linking LGBTQ+ mentoring with a de-escalation of the \npsychosocial development issues that historically derailed the academic persistence and \nsuccess of this student population. They laid the groundwork to develop programs further \nharnessing the collective experience of LGBTQ+ role models within the university to \nbuild supportive communities in which these students may continue to explore and \ndevelop their psychosexual identities in tandem with, rather than at the expense of, their \nacademic ones. \n More specifically, a case can be made that the mechanisms of LGBTQ+ identity \ndevelopment are now more fully understood. Although significant progress has been \nmade in campus climate and LGBTQ+ acceptance, the developmental hurdles these \nstudents face are not alleviated. Safer spaces have been carved out for LGBTQ+ students \nto navigate and integrate their identities in; the next step, institutionally, is tailoring \nstructures supporting these students’ psychosocial needs and facilitating healthy identity \ndevelopment. Programs offering LGBTQ+ specific counseling, mentoring, and \ncommunity/leadership development are an essential next step; helping them navigate the \ndevelopment of identity and cultural competency removes barriers remaining between \nthese students and their success.  \n41 \nCHAPTER 3 \nMETHODS AND INNOVATION \nOur Many Hues: An Inclusive LGBTQ+ Community Model \nThe HUES LGBTQ+ mentoring program was developed to provide psychosocial \nsupport and foster identity development and community engagement for gender and \nsexual minority students at Arizona State University. The title of the HUES program is a \nnod to both the traditional LGB rainbow flag and the multiple sexual and gender minority \ncommunities, many of which have adopted their own variation of this flag to represent \ntheir own distinct identities (see Appendix B). In developing the HUES program, it was \nimportant to acknowledge the broader cultural LGBTQ+ cultural and historical \nsignificance represented by the rainbow flag and, at the same time, honor the identities of \nall the LGBTQ+ community’s comprised populations; the LGBTQ+ community includes \npeople of various spiritual, ethnic and racial populations that span socioeconomic and \ncultural demographics. This community is non-monolithic and culturally amorphic, yet a \ncommon denominator is found in the challenges to identity navigation across the \nspectrum. Universally, LGBTQ+ people are united by the common experience of \ngrowing up as cultural minorities. Whereas most cultures are a byproduct of and are \nshaped by the interpersonal and familial capital of its comprised members, no such \ncapital exists save for what is collectively created within the LGBTQ+ community: there \nis no growing up knowing how to be gay. The rainbow flag and its permutations are \nsymbols of pride and hope for the LGBTQ+ community, and seemed a fitting inspiration \n42 \nfor a program fostering the spirit of LGBTQ+ resilience and cultural legacy in a new \ngeneration of students.  \nThe HUES pilot launched for the 2017-2018 academic year; with data collection \ntaking place in the fall semester of the 2018-2019 academic year. Serving students from \nall socioeconomic brackets, geographical regions, races and ethnicities, ASU’s \npopulation provides a robust sampling, but its size presents challenges in serving smaller \npopulations like its LGBTQ+ community. The logistical issues of providing and creating \nawareness and connection to resources requires innovation and effort, presenting an \nopportunity to explore a new service delivery model to these students.  \nProgram Innovation and Rationale \n \nASU’s primary LGBTQ+ student support apparatus is limited to three broad \nareas: general health support resources; academic/curricular programming; and student \nengagement, agency-creating, and leadership. The out@asu LGBTQ+ resource website \nprovides a comprehensive directory of services and resources for ASU’s LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. \nSupport Resources \nIn addition to a staff of clinical counselors trained to therapeutically support \nLGBTQ+ students, ASU’s Counseling Services offers LGBTQ+ support through its \n‘LGBTQ+ Power Hour’, a weekly group counseling program that is open to all members \nof the ASU LGBTQ+ student community (ASU, 2019-c). ASU Health Services provides \nsupport to members of the LGBTQ+ community as part of its comprehensive portfolio of \nmedical services to the broader student community, including access to primary care \n43 \nproviders for STI testing and treatment, Pre and Post Exposure Prophylaxix (PEP/PrEP) \nfor reduction of HIV risk, comprehensive gynecological and men’s health services, and \nmedical care and hormonal transition services for transgender persons (ASU, 2019-d).  \nAcademic/curricular programming. ASU’s College of Integrative Sciences and \nArts (CISA) and Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions (CPSCS) \npartner to offer an LGBT Certificate program, an undergraduate program examining the \n“experiences, history, culture, and contemporary issues related to LGBT people,” \noffering members of the ASU academic community “the opportunity to prepare students \nfor diversity and participatory democracy and advance social knowledge about issues \nrelated to LGBT communities” (ASU, 2019-e). At the graduate level, the School for \nSocial Transformation (SST) offers a graduate certificate in Sexuality and Gender \nStudies, a flexible, interdisciplinary program that allows students to “gain theoretical and \nanalytical tools to examine gender and sexual formations,” examine how “social issues \nand state institutions impact and are impacted by sexuality as a social norm,” and allows \nstudents to “further investigate sexualities in relation to sexual stratification, reproductive \nrights and justice, sexual health and justice, carceral genders and sexualities, sex work, \nthe state and legal system, and transnational and diasporadic formations” (ASU, 2019-f). \nStudent engagement. Under the advisement of the Office for Student and \nCultural Engagement/International Student Engagement (SCE/ISE), the Rainbow \nCoalition is an identity-based student governing body with the mission of improving \ncampus climate and organizing resources, services and support for the university’s \nLGBTQ+ student community. The Rainbow Coalition supports ASU’s LGBTQ+ student \n44 \nclubs and organizations, eight of which are currently active across the institution’s four \ncampus locations at the undergraduate and graduate levels (ASU, 2019-g). \nIn addition to the Rainbow Coalition and its associated student organizations, \nstructured LGBTQ+ student engagement is provided through Fraternity and Sorority Life \n(FSL). Gamma Rho Lambda, the nation’s first multicultural lesbian sorority, operates a \nchapter at ASU that is “inclusive of cisgender women, trans women, trans men, and \ngender-variant people of all sexualities and racial identities” (Gamma Rho Lambda, \n2019). ASU also housed the founding chapter of Sigma Phi Beta, a national LGBTQ+ \nfraternity first chartered in 2003 (ASU, 2019-h). Other Greek communities, including \nEpsilon Sigma Alpha, foster leadership and community across diverse populations, \nincluding the LGBTQ+ community (Epsilon Sigma Alpha, 2019). \nWhile ASU’s commitment to rich curricular opportunities and student support \nresources is admirable, this model does not sufficiently address the needs of its full \nLGBTQ+ community. The peer support resources offered by Counseling Services \nundoubtedly benefits students discovering and reconciling an LGBTQ+ identity or \nnavigating associated issues (disclosure or ‘coming out’ to self and others, internal \nhomophobia and dealing with external heterosexism/normalizing of cisgender and \nheterosexual privilege). Meanwhile, the institution’s current student-led engagement \nmodel, led by the Rainbow Coalition, student clubs/organizations, and Greek community \n– with their emphasis on student leadership, advocacy and community empowerment – \nprovides social and cultural enrichment opportunities and community support favored by \nstudents with more salient LGBTQ+ identities. HUES bridges the two ends of the \nLGBTQ+ identity development spectrum. By allowing participants to navigate emerging \n45 \nsexual orientations and/or gender identities outside a clinical setting, it normalizes the \nprocess, engages with students’ developing identities and fosters community engagement \nand accrual of LGBTQ+ cultural capital. \nProgramming facilitating this transition from initial identity exploration to \ncommunity immersion is needed at ASU. In a series of LGBTQ+ needs assessment \nsurveys (total n= 66) (Reeves-Blurton, 2016 and 2017), students currently involved in \nLGBTQ+ student community engagement tend toward strongly integrated and salient \nLGBTQ+ identity. Students struggling to reconcile LGBTQ+ identities and/or practice \nidentity concealment (are ‘closeted’) are more likely to seek counseling or informal \nadvising but are less engaged in LGBTQ+ community development programming. This \nis the space HUES inhabits. HUES provides a forum for participants to challenge \nheteronormative assumptions and build resiliency, LGBTQ+ cultural capital, and social \nsupport networks, ultimately attaining the identity affinity and salience needed to enter \nthe wider LGBTQ+ community. \nA primary innovation of HUES, aside from its unique positioning to foster and \ndevelop LGBTQ+ identity and cultural competencies, is its multi-modal structure. HUES \nis scaffolded to provide engagement aligned with the various phases of LGBTQ+ student \nidentity development articulated by D’Augelli, Bilodeau and others. The program offers \none-to-one and community engagement, letting participants engage in ways pertinent to \ndevelopment of identity salience regardless of their current level. One-to-one mentoring \nprovides a hand-off from Counseling Services to students ready to explore LGBTQ+ \nindividuality, while group programming – workshops, panel discussions and community \ndialogues – allow development of networks, further creation of LGBTQ+ cultural capital, \n46 \nand ease entry into LGBTQ+ community membership. Having achieved greater identity \nsalience, participants may then be ready to explore social advocacy, community \ndevelopment and leadership within the existing LGBTQ+ student community. \nSetting \nHUES is housed in and operated under ASU’s Graduate College as a part of its \nGraduate College Mentoring Network (GCMN). The GCMN provides administrative \nsupport and resources for several mentoring initiatives targeting the psychosocial support, \ncommunity engagement, and affinity-based academic and professional development of \nthe university’s graduate student population. Although HUES was initially developed as a \nplatform for gender or sexual minority graduate students providing mentoring for \nundergraduates, initial research cycles indicated need at both the graduate and \nundergraduate level for LGBTQ+ affinity-based mentoring. Both undergraduate and \ngraduate students surveyed also overwhelmingly preferred faculty/staff mentors with \nsignificant LGBTQ+ life experience. Therefore, with the consent of Graduate College \nleadership, HUES was expanded into its current model, with faculty and staff serving as \nmentors to both undergraduate and graduate students. \nThe HUES program was specifically designed to bridge the various LGBTQ+ \ncommunities at ASU, and its development and implementation could not have been \npossible without support from various sectors of this community. ASU’s LGBTQ+ \nFaculty and Staff Association has played a prominent role from the onset of the program, \nwith association members volunteering both as HUES mentors and participating in \nHUES programming efforts, serving as discussion facilitators and panelists. ASU’s \n47 \nstudent engagement community also played an instrumental role in the HUES launch; the \nleadership teams of the Rainbow Coalition and LGBTQ+ clubs and organizations were \ninstrumental in spreading initial awareness of HUES programming and served as \ninformal focus groups in the development of workshop and discussion group topics. Both \nASU Counseling Services and the Sun Devil Support Network, the institution’s sexual \nviolence prevention team, assisted in development of community engagement \nprogramming for HUES, and recruitment materials for HUES mentorship and \nprogramming were distributed through Counseling Services’ LGBTQ+ facilitated support \ngroup. However, because of the confidential nature of Counseling Services’ mandate, \nthere was no direct recruitment through this channel.   \nTimeline \n Initial research and data collection began in October 2016 with the launch of an \nLGBTQ+ student needs assessment survey and follow-up interviews. This survey was \naccessed via a web link embedded in a letter of explanation and consent distributed via \nthe social media channels of the Rainbow Coalition. Twelve responses were recorded, \nand two participants agreed to follow-up interviews. See Appendix F for needs \nassessment survey. The findings of this preliminary work informed the development and \nrelease of a second, more robust LGBTQ+ campus climate and LGBTQ+ cultural capital \ninventory survey, launched in September 2017. To capture a broader subset of ASU’s \nLGBTQ+ student population than the previous survey, two additional distribution \nchannels were utilized: \n48 \n1. the social media channel for inQUEERy, “an interdisciplinary collaborative \nthat aims to enhance the field of study related to sexual orientation, gender \nidentity, and expression” (inQUEERy, 2019) and a joint initiative of ASU’s \nCounseling Psychology and School of Social Work and Counseling;  \n2. and the weekly faculty, staff, and student email bulletin for Barrett, the \nHonors College.  \nA total of 55 graduate and undergraduate ASU students responded to this Qualtrics-based \nsurvey. See Appendix A for complete campus climate and LGBTQ+ cultural capital \ninventory survey. \n The HUES pilot launched in August 2017. An initial cohort was matched after \nsigning interest forms at a recruitment table at Rainbow Welcome, the university’s \nLGBTQ+ student information fair and welcome mixer, and at an informational session \nheld during the first week of classes and advertised to all interested LGBTQ+ faculty, \nstaff and students through the university’s event calendar. From the initial applicant pool, \nfour students were matched with three mentors; additional mentoring partnerships were \nmatched over the course of the academic year. During both semesters, students met with \nmentors, established mentoring goals and met in one-to-one sessions; in the spring \nsemester, one-to-one mentoring sessions continued, and mentors encouraged their \nmentees to attend the HUES program’s first community engagement program, a \nworkshop around communities of practice and inclusive group culture. Though not an \nattendance success, this workshop allowed for greater fine-tuning of programming for the \nsubsequent year. Recruitment continued over summer, with new mentors and mentees \n49 \nmatched and one-to-one mentoring commencing in August and monthly community \nengagement programming launching in September. \nParticipants \n HUES mentees (referred to simply as ‘participants’ from this point forward) are \nASU undergraduate and graduate students identifying as a part of the gender and sexual \nminority communities. Because  the LGBTQ+ community is comprised of individuals \nnavigating myriad intersecting cultural identities, and therefore issues of intersectionality \noften become issues of friction within LGBTQ+ identity navigation (Poynter & \nWashington, 2005; Spivey-Mooring, 2014), HUES mentors are selected based on their \nmentoring application statements to ensure participants of all races, ethnicities, \nsocioeconomic status, first-generation status, and other markers of privilege or access (or \nlack thereof) are made to feel welcome, included, and their perspectives acknowledged \nand validated. Furthermore, mentors were specifically vetted and selected for \nparticipation based upon previous work in LGBTQ+ mentoring, education, advocacy, or \ncommunity engagement and understanding of cultural power dynamics/intersectionality \nin regards to the LGBTQ+ experience. Though each mentoring pair determines their own \nspecific mentorship goals driven by the participant’s needs, HUES community \nengagement programming is designed to facilitate LGBTQ+ identity development and \nresilience, provide psychosocial support, and foster LGBTQ+ community engagement for \nparticipants regardless of their current level of LGBTQ+ identity or acculturation. \nRecruitment for HUES took place through social media channels and word-of-mouth \nthrough the following established communities: the ASU Rainbow Coalition and its \n50 \nassociated student organizations; the ASU LGBT Studies Certificate program; the \nGraduate and Professional Students Association (GPSA); Barrett, the Honors College and \nthe Barrett LGBTQ+ student organization; the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences’ \nWomen and Gender Studies program, School for Social Transformation (SST), School \nfor Human Evolution and Social Change (SHESC), and the Department of Counseling \nPsychology and School of Social Work and Counseling’s inQUEERy gender- and sexual-\nminority research program; the Graduate College’s Interdisciplinary Research \nColloquium (IRC); ASU Counseling Services; and ASU Housing’s residential staff. \n These areas provide critical support and engagement or programming to LGBTQ+ \nstudents at various points in their identity navigation. ASU Counseling Services and ASU \nHousing residential staff are often initial engagement points for students questioning or \nstruggling to navigate an emerging LGBTQ+ identity. The LGBTQ+-related academic \nprograms attract students who have or are identifying or building identities as members \nof the LGBTQ+ community, while student organizations attract students seeking greater \ncommunity-building, advocacy, and leadership opportunities. To foster initial buy-in and \nsupport, ongoing informational meetings with student organization leadership and \nacademic or resource unit administrators, teams and faculty occurred in advance of the \n2018-2019 academic year. Though targeted recruitment has been limited, word-of-mouth \nrecruitment and the HUES program’s increasing visibility within the university \ncommunity has spurred growth. HUES was highlighted by the State Press, the \nuniversity’s student-run online newspaper, in October of 2018, then again in both the \nGraduate College’s newsletter and an article that trended quickly on ASU Now, the \ninstitution’s news hub, after being nominated for and receiving the Committee for \n51 \nCampus Inclusion’s Catalyst Award, an annual recognition of ASU faculty, staff, \nstudents and initiatives promoting inclusion and catalyzing transformation within the \ninstitution in November of 2018. Going into the spring semester of its first full year of \noperation, the HUES participant pool has grown to twenty-one undergraduate and \ngraduate students. \nMentors \nHUES mentors are gender and/or sexual minority ASU faculty, staff and graduate \nstudents. One graduate student participant in the pilot program returned as a mentor for \n2018-2019; as the program matures, the participant-to-mentor pipeline will be \nincreasingly critical to the program’s sustainability, and participants with at least one year \nof HUES experience will be invited to apply as mentors. Mentors for the initial pilot \nprogram were recruited from the ASU LGBTQ+ Faculty and Staff Association, the \nCommittee for Campus Inclusion, and attendance at HUES informational sessions upon \ndemonstration of an understanding not only of the LGBTQ+ experience, but of the ways \nLGBTQ+ identity interact with and are complicated by intersecting and often competing \nidentities (i.e. spiritual beliefs, cultural worldviews, and socioeconomic status or \neducation level). Announcement of the program launch in the Graduate College’s \nquarterly e-newsletter yielded additional applications for the 2018-2019 full program \nlaunch in August 2018, and subsequent press around the program’s Catalyst Award win \nspurred subsequent interest through the fall semester. Until further mentor recruitment \ncan take place, the HUES program is currently operating at capacity, with all twenty-one \nmentors currently matched. Mentor candidates are admitted into the mentor pool upon \n52 \nsubmission and screening of the mentoring application. See Appendix G for sample \nmentor application.  \nResearcher Role \nThe development and launch of HUES has been made possible by my role as \nprogram manager of professional development and mentoring initiatives within the ASU \nGraduate College, where a bulk of my responsibilities include oversight of the Graduate \nCollege’s two identity-based mentoring communities and development of best practices, \ntrainings, an annual faculty mentoring excellence award program, and workshops. Each \nof these initiatives fall under my duties in supporting creation of a broader institutional \nmentoring climate supporting the needs of graduate students university-wide. \nThough supporting the psychosocial support and identity development of the \nuniversity’s LGBTQ+ student community is a passion of mine and the reason I’ve \ncreated the HUES program, my role with HUES is limited to an administrative one. All \nprogram content, from mentor and participant recruitment to creation of mentor training \nmaterials, mentoring agreements, participation guidelines and development of monthly \ncommunity engagement programming, are my responsibility, as is participant tracking \nand program assessment. Aside from welcoming mentors and participants to the program, \nbrokering the initial mentoring matches, conducting monthly check-ins with each mentor \nand offering myself as an ongoing resource to both mentors and participants, my \ninvolvement with HUES is strictly behind the scenes.  \n53 \n Because I am member of the LGBTQ+ campus community and therefore share a \ncultural identity and values with participants in the research study, but my interactions \nwith the study participants are limited, I am strictly what Creswell (2015) terms a \nparticipant/observer. The notable exception to this role, of course, is in my interactions \nwith the three study participants who have consented to participate in the monthly \ninterviews that comprise the qualitative data collection component of this mixed-methods \nstudy. During the three months in which interviews took place, I was in frequent \ncommunication with these three participants, both for the logistics of coordinating \ninterviews and conducting member checks and in order to establish a relationship of trust \nand familiarity between myself and those participants in the hopes of facilitating more \nauthentic and data-rich interactions during interviews. Over the course of the data \ncollection period, I became an informal secondary mentor and developed friendships with \ntwo of these participants, who came to view me more as a peer due to our shared \nLGBTQ+ and graduate student statuses, and we’re continued to meet periodically just to \ncheck in – with them as interested in the progress of my research as I have become in \ntheir continued persistence and success both within HUES and their academic and \nprofessional lives. While the HUES program began as a professional passion of mine, my \ninteractions with these participants throughout the past months have fueled an even \nstronger personal commitment to the success and longevity of this program. \n \n \n54 \nAssessment Instruments \nData Collection Inventory \nTable 1 (below) outlines the data collection instruments used in assessment of the \nHUES LGBTQ+ mentoring program indicating at which period of program the \ninstrument was administered, the corresponding timeframe, and the type of data \ncollected. An asterisk (*) denotes data collection specifically utilized by the research \nstudy. \nTable 1.

Including \nprospective participant age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation/gender identity, and a \nmentoring need statement, as well as mentor preferences, this profile (1) aids in mentor \nmatching and (2) provides meaningful demographic statistics to ensure appropriate \nrepresentation within the program. See Appendix H for participant application form. \n \n55 \nMentoring Agreement \nAll incoming participants are required to complete this form with their mentor at \ntheir first meeting. This form outlines the mentoring expectations of participants and \nserves as a contract between mentor and participant, ensuring that both mentor and \nparticipant understand the commitment expected by the other. It also ensures participants \nunderstand the expectations of the program more generally, including the expectation to \nmeet with their mentor at least twice per month and for no less than 30 minutes per \nsession. See Appendix I for mentoring agreement. \nPersonal Resilience Assessment \nAdapted from the Modified Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support \n(MMSPSS) (Brandon-Friedman & Kim, 2016), the assessment measures LGBTQ+ \nstudents’ perceived levels of social support in four domains: family, friendships, \nLGBTQ+ mentors/role models and LGBTQ+ student organizations. HUES participants \nassessed sixteen statements on a seven-point Likert scale (1=Very Strongly Disagree; \n2=Strongly Disagree; 3=Mildly Disagree; 4=Neutral; 5=Mildly Agree; 6=Strongly \nAgree; 7=Very Strongly Agree). This assessment is conducted both upon program entry \nand at the conclusion of each semester. See Appendix J for personal resilience \nassessment. \nCommunity Engagement Programming \nIn addition to one-to-one mentoring sessions, participants will be encouraged to \nattend monthly community engagement events. These events are workshops and panel \n56 \ndiscussions designed to examine elements of the LGBTQ+ experience and challenges, \nbolster a sense of community and normalcy, and provide participants with the tools to \nidentify, understand, and build resilience. While attendance by HUES participants is \noptional, attendance numbers at these events will be utilized in assessment of the impact \nand reach of the HUES programming, and participants are encouraged to discuss insights \nfrom these programs in their mentoring conversations.    \nInterviews \nThree HUES program participants were asked to participate in monthly interviews (at \nthe end of September, October, and November) to share and discuss their mentoring \nexperiences, identity breakthroughs, and challenges, for a total of three interviews per \nparticipant. Each interview lasted approximately 60-70 minutes, and was audiorecorded \nand later transcribed. In accordance with grounded theory (Saldana, 2016), emergent \nthemes from each round of interviews influenced lines of questioning in subsequent \nsessions. Interviews included both scripted questions allowing for standardization across \ninterviews and ensuring all participants addressed the same general topic areas, and \nunscripted follow-up questions that prompted deeper elaboration upon participants’ \nanswers and allowed tailoring of the interviews to address each participants’ experiences. \nQuestions centered generally around issues of identity salience, resilience-building, \nLGBTQ+ cultural capital accrual/efficacy, and community engagement. First interviews \nasked participants to recount their own personal histories, particularly as relevant to the \nformation of their LGBTQ+ identities. Final interviews took a more holistic, \n57 \nretrospective tone and asked participants to reflect upon the larger experience and lessons \nlearned by participation in the HUES program.  \nProcedures \n \n Data collection for the HUES study consisted of three primary components: \nquantitative pre- and post-intervention personal resilience assessments for all HUES \nparticipants and the transcribed interviews throughout the semester of three selected \nparticipants. Initial data collection commenced in August of 2018 as participants began \ncompleting the pre-intervention personal resilience assessments upon program entry. \nParticipants who had been a part of the 2017-2018 pilot, in which no inventory was \nrequired, were also asked to complete it at this time. Meanwhile, the three participants \nselected to take part in interviews were scheduled for interviews beginning at the end of \nSeptember, with a second interview in late October and a final one in the first week of \nDecember.  At the conclusion of the fall semester, all HUES participants were asked to \ncomplete the post-intervention personal resilience assessment. A brief programmatic \ntimeline follows: \nTable 2. Research Study Timeframe and Milestones \nTimeframe Study Milestone \nApril-July Mentor recruitment \nJuly-August Mentor selection and training \nJuly-August Participant recruitment \nMid August Mentor/participant matching \nMid August 1-1 mentoring begins \nMid August Personal resilience assessment (pre-assessment) \nSeptember Community engagement events begin \n58 \nSeptember-November Monthly interviews \nEarly December Personal resilience assessment (post-assessment) \n \nRecruitment and Matching \nMentor recruitment and training occurred in summer. Mentors were provided training in \nbest mentoring practices and provided resources in administration of the personal \nresilience assessment; although an overview of student development theory was provided \nin context of the mentor’s anticipated role and additional resources were suggested, in-\ndepth theoretical training was not provided. Participant recruitment occurred \nsimultaneously to mentor recruitment and training, with initial matching completed by \nmid-August. However, HUES mentor and participant applications continued to be \naccepted on an ongoing basis, with matches made as new participants request mentors.  \nTo join HUES, prospective mentors and participants completed mentor/mentee \napplication profiles. These profiles included basic demographic data (sexual/gender \nidentity and orientation, age), academic information (academic level and year, general \narea of study for students, academic or career area for faculty and staff), and matching \npreferences (age range, gender/sexual orientation preference, academic area). Mentor \nprofiles included short narratives explaining their motivations in becoming a mentor, \ntheir previous mentoring experience, and a brief personal statement. On their \napplications, participants were asked to share the reasons they were seeking mentorship \nand what their general mentorship goals were. These applications, submitted through a \nGoogle form, populated into mentor and mentee applicant matching spreadsheets. Upon \napplying, the HUES program manager invited prospective mentors and participants to a \n59 \nshort interview to discuss the goals and expectations of the program and research project, \nas well as to help the program manager determine the strongest mentoring match.  \nUpon completion of participant intake interviews, most participants were matched \nwith a mentor within one week. Mentor and mentee were then electronically introduced \nand provided with the next steps in finalizing their mentoring relationship. At this time, \nmentor and mentee received tips and best practices for initiating and maintaining a \nmentoring relationship (Appendix K), a copy of the mentoring agreement and mentoring \ngoals worksheets (Appendix L), and mentees were provided with information to access \nand complete the personal resilience inventory. For sample program introduction emails, \nsee Appendices M and N. Mentor and participant were asked to meet within one week’s \ntime, have an initial meeting, complete the mentoring goals worksheet, and sign and \nreturn the mentoring contract. This meeting is a ‘trial’ session; if either mentor or \nparticipant feels the match is not an appropriate fit to their mentoring goals, they may \ndecline the match, and the program manager would reach out to initiate a new mentoring \nmatch. However, they are cautioned that they may only be rematched once per semester. \nIf both mentor and participant agree that the match is a strong one, they then complete the \nmentoring goals worksheet and sign and return the mentoring contract to the program \nmanager. Once completed, the mentoring agreement and personal resilience assessment \nare filed with the program manager.  \nOne-to-one Mentoring and Community Engagement Events \n Initial meetings are dedicated to one-to-one mentoring, providing a minimally-\nstructured mentoring environment in which meetings are driven by goals articulated in \nthe mentoring agreement and insights derived from the personal resilience assessment. \n60 \nOne-to-one, relatively unstructured meetings foster connection and trust between mentor \nand participant and facilitate exploration of individual identity, goal-setting and resource \nneeds.  \n Mentors and participant are encouraged to supplement one-on-one meetings with \ncommunity-building and identity-development opportunities. These community \nengagement programs (themed mentor-facilitated discussions on identity, shared \nchallenges in LGBTQ+ identity navigation, panel discussions on LGBTQ+ issues with \nmembers of LGBTQ+ Faculty/Staff Association, Counseling Services, university \nwellness initiatives and other community partners) are critical to advancing identity \nsalience and are offered monthly throughout the academic year. These sessions encourage \nbroader conversations around LGBTQ+ cultural competencies, facilitating deeper \nexploration of LGBTQ+ identity and community through such topics as understanding \nidentity intersections and intersectionality, the politics of LGBTQ+ identity and \ncommunity-building, and resilience. For the 2018-2019 HUES program schedule, see \nAppendix O.  \nData Analysis \n \n This study follows a participatory action research (PAR) paradigm. Problem- and \nsolution-driven, it blurs the boundaries of researcher and participant and necessitates a \nconstant interaction between researcher and participant. As Mertler and Charles (2011) \nstate: \n [A]ction research deals with your problems, not someone else’s. [It] is very \ntimely; it can start now—or whenever you are ready—and provides immediate \nresults…action research provides educators with opportunities to better \nunderstand, and therefore improve, their educational practices. [A]s a process, \n61 \naction research can also promote the building of stronger relationships among \ncolleagues with whom we work. Finally, and possibly most importantly, action \nresearch provides educators with alternative ways of viewing and approaching \neducational questions and problems with new ways of examining our own \neducational practices (pp. 339-340) \n \nDue to its PAR framework, the study relies upon the voluntary participation of HUES \nstudents not only through structured interviews, but in participation in the meaning-\nmaking of the data gleaned. With a purpose of creating, implementing, and evaluating \nprogramming designed to bring about tangible outcomes that are “meaningful and have \nimmediate and direct application” (Mertler, 2014, p. 4), a PAR approach is the most \neffective way of ensuring student buy-in and enthusiasm for the project. A PAR \nframework in which interview participants are allowed to review not only the interview \ntranscripts but also the researcher’s insights from those transcripts (through examination \nof code books and, in this case, advanced review of human interest news articles \nsubmitted to various university outlets promoting the early findings of the research) \nensures that the participant voice is always at the forefront of the research findings. \n The HUES project employed a sequential, qualitative – quantitative mixed \nmethods approach. The nine personal interviews were the driving heart of the research, \nproviding a rich examination of the lives and both individual and shared experiences of \nparticipants. Because this study is nonexperimental and exploratory, and little research \nhas been conducted on the connections between LGBTQ+ identity and cultural \ndevelopment, resiliency and college persistence/success, a grounded theory approach in \nwhich qualitative data is transcribed, then coded and analyzed to discover emergent \nthemes and similarities/dissimilarities in experiences between participants is most \nappropriate. Qualitative data determined axial coding categories, determined lines of \n62 \ninquiry for subsequent interviews, and corroborated emerging themes. Meanwhile, \nquantitative primary source data (personal resilience assessment pre- and post-\nintervention) provided a measurable baseline for all students’ levels of social support \naround their LGBTQ+ identities – not just those of the interview participants – at the \nbeginning and end of the research study. Upon comparison at the end of the study, this \nquantitative data confirmed the emergent themes from the qualitative data could be \ngeneralized to the larger HUES participant population, and while the specific experiences \nand stories of the interview participants were unique, their experiences were mirrored by \nthe larger group (Ivanova, 2015, p. 158).  \n Theoretical sampling and a constant-comparative method allowed data collected \nthroughout the study to expose and clarify patterns and themes, while coding qualitative \ndata at each stage of collection allowed emerging themes to direct further lines of inquiry \nuntil saturation had been reached (Charmaz, 2006). An inductive coding approach \nallowed “extensive and varied raw text data” from interview transcripts to be condensed \ninto a brief summary to “establish clear links between the research objectives and the \nsummary findings” and “develop a model or theory about the underlying structure of \nexperiences or processes” (Charmaz, 2006, p. 1).  HyperResearch electronic coding \nsoftware was used to “store, manage and reconfigure data for analytical reflection” \n(Saldana, 2016, p. 22), rendering the maintenance of a separate codebook unnecessary. \nCoding Strategies for Qualitative Data  \nInterviews were analyzed consistent to grounded theory, as suited to concurrent \nevaluation of multiple data types and sources (Saldana, 2016). Initial descriptive open \ncoding and concurrent jotting/memoing allowed exploration of perceptions, values, and \n63 \nexperiences, “providing ideas for analytical consideration while the study progresses” (p. \n17). As interview participants’ stories unfolded, constant-comparative examination \nallowed identification of phenomena, local concepts, principles, or process features \nacross participants (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), informing further data collection through \nincreasingly focused/intentional rounds of subsequent inquiry.   \n As data was examined and the collective participant experiences compared, \nconceptualized and categorized (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), axial coding for emergent \nsimilarities or differences took place. This is a vital step in understanding the properties \nand dimensions of coding categories, how they interact and relate to each other, and in \nconstructing a working theory, (Saldana, 2016). Initial categorical sorting was driven by \nthe six constructs of D’Augelli’s LGBTQ+ identity development model – i.e. ‘entering an \nLGBTQ+ community’, ‘becoming an LGBTQ+ offspring – and themes related to \nresilience. This facilitated the emergence of meta-meaning between individual/collective \nnarratives and drove substantive code development; identification of themes and trends; \nexploration of categories, subcategories and the way they correlated to one another; and \nbegan a process of reducing and sorting of codes into larger conceptual categories for \ntheory development (Saldana, 2016). “When the major categories are compared,” notes \nSaldana (2016, p. 11), “you begin to transcend the ‘reality’ of your data and progress \ntoward the thematic, conceptual, and theoretical.”  \n Emergent substantive codes were examined to identify theoretical codes, \nconceptualizing “how the substantive codes may relate to each other as hypotheses to be \nintegrated into theory (Glaser, 1978, p. 55). Finally, theoretical coding across all \ninterview transcripts facilitated a weaving together of the various substantive codes and a \n64 \nbeautiful “fractured story” (Glaser, 1978, p.72) “into an organized whole theory” (Glaser, \n1978 p. 74). \nData validation. Theoretical sampling is considered more robust than other forms of \nsampling, as it produces codes and themes in quantifiable instances for corroboration by \nother researchers, is analytically induced, and provides a structure to data collection and \nanalysis processes missing in other qualitative sampling methods, (Dudovskiy, 2018). \nThe constant comparison between individual interview session transcripts and \ntriangulation to pre- and post-test personal resilient assessment data ensured emergent \nthemes were valid and reflective of participants’ experiences, as reinforced in monthly \ninterviews. Sharing axial and emerging theoretical codes with interview participants \nthroughout the process as a form of member check further validated data. \nCoding timelines for qualitative data \n \n As grounded theory approach calls for constant comparison of theory-driving \ndata, data collection and analysis was iterative and simultaneous, with ongoing data \ncollection, as illustrated in Table 3 below: \nTable 3. Data Collection Protocol Implementation \nInstrument Frequency Sample Number \nPersonal resilience \nassessment Pre/post intervention All 2x \nParticipant interviews Monthly Purposeful sampling 3x/month \n \nAssessment of Qualitative Data \n  The first round of research interviews at the end of September provided emergent \n“first impressions” (Saldana, 2016, p.17), informing lines of deeper inquiry at the end of \nNovember and December. Interviews were conducted and recorded with three \n65 \nparticipants per month, transcribed, open and axial coded to provide an analytical \nframework from which to approach guiding questions for the next round of interviews. \nThe richer description provided in subsequent interviews either confirmed/corroborated \nor rejected emerging impressions from previous interviews and spurred development of \nsubsequent axial codes. These codes focused on identification and analysis of potential \nresilience factors and their potential correlations to identity development, program \naffiliation/community engagement and institutional persistence. As they emerged, \nthematic codes were member-checked with interview participants. Finally, reconciliation \nwith data from the personal resilience assessment pre-and post-tests allowed qualitative \ndata to be triangulated to inform a robust final theory.  \nAssessment of quantitative data \n In addition to monthly interviews with three HUES program participants, data \nwas collected by way of the pre- and post-participation scores on the HUES personal \nresilience inventory, completed in August and December by all HUES mentees. In this \nself-assessment, participants rated their level of agreement to sixteen statements \ncategorized into four themes: perceived level of support from an LGBTQ+ mentor or role \nmodel, family, peers or friends, and an LGBTQ+ group or community. Statements were \nassessed on a seven-point scale (‘1’ = Very Strongly Disagree, ‘4’ = Neutral, and ‘7’ = \nVery Strongly Agree). 11 participants completed and submitted the pre-intervention \nassessment; five submitted the post-intervention assessment. \nThe personal resilience assessment pre- and post-intervention median scores and \nstandard deviations were organized and analyzed via SPSS 24. Because differing \nnumbers of participants completed the pre-intervention assessment and post-inventory \n66 \nassessment, nonparametric t-testing (Wilcoxon signed-rank testing) was utilized to \ndetermine statistical significance of differences in mean values across pre/post scores. \nMedian values from the four constructs and Likert-scaled statements of the personal \nresilience assessment pre- and post-tests provided a baseline for comparison/triangulation \nagainst qualitative data drawn from interviews, adding context and meaning.  \n Once the HUES study launched, data from all participant profiles and mentoring \nexpectation forms were reviewed and evaluated to create a participant demographic \nsnapshot (age, sexual identity, gender identity, academic level). The open-ended \napplication statement portions of the participant profile and goals/objectives from the \nmentoring expectation form were thematically coded and composited to capture (1) the \ngeneral reasons participants have joined the program and (2) specific goals and objectives \nin joining an LGBTQ+ mentoring program.  \nSummary of Data Analysis \nTable 4 (below) lists all data collection protocols, corresponding data types and \nplace in the mixed methods qualitative-quantitative sequence. Personal interviews, with \ntheir focus on experiences and perceptions during and post-intervention, correspond to \nRQ#1 (“What does the process of LGBTQ+ identity construction look like for gender- \nand sexual-minority students, including students from non-dominant cultural \nbackgrounds for whom LGBTQ+ identity is one of multiple competing identities, and how \ndoes mentorship influence the perceived identities of these students? ”). HUES \nparticipant profiles, mentoring agreements, and pre- and post-intervention personal \nresilience assessments and align with RQ#2 (“How does participation in an LGBTQ+ \nmentoring program influence participants’ perceptions of development of resilience-\n67 \nbuilding capacity?”) and provide data regarding participants’ needs and reasons for \nentering the HUES program. Mentoring agreement (participant development plan) also \nprovides data addressing RQ#2 (“How does participation in an LGBTQ+ mentoring \nprogram influence participants’ perceptions of development of resilience-building \ncapacity?). \nTable 4. Data and Corresponding Research Question(s) \nInstrument Data Type Research Question \nInterview  Qualitative RQ1 \nPersonal resilience assessment Quantitative RQ2 \n \n  \n68 \nCHAPTER 4 \nRESULTS \nParticipant Introductions \n \n A total of nine interviews were conducted with three HUES participants \nthroughout September, October and November, culminating in over twelve hours and \nninety pages of transcribed data. Over the course of these months, a rich, complex \nmetanarrative of challenges and success emerged. Participants’ history of engagement \nwith HUES varied, ranging from less than one semester to over a full year. All were \ngraduate students, and time at ASU and in Arizona ranged from one year to over three \nyears. All joined HUES in order to gain greater support in navigating their sexual and/or \ngender identities (particularly around the coming out process) and to find membership \nwithin a larger LGBTQ+ community. \nIt is important to note that two interview participants were international students \noriginally from China; and that their explorations of LGBTQ+ cultural competency, \npersonal identity and community membership were shaped by the values and norms of \nthese identities. While there is an emerging body of research literature focused around \nLGBTQ+ acceptance in non-Western societies where non-heterosexual identities are \nstigmatized or severely marginalized, including China (see Cao, Wang & Gao, 2010; Hu \n& Wang, 2013; Xie & Peng, 2018), it remains small. The inclusion of these students in \nthe HUES research study afforded an opportunity to examine the confluence of personal \nand cultural identity in the negotiation and management of an LGBTQ+ identity. It is \nimportant to recognize that their experiences, while wholly similar to those of the third \n69 \n(domestic) student, demonstrate the importance of ingrained sociocultural attitudes in \nLGBTQ+ identity construction. \nParticipant 1: Pat \nThe first interview participant, who chose to go by the name of Pat for the \npurposes of this study, identifies as female-bodied but gender-nonbinary, and for the \npurposes of this study will be identified by their preferred they/them/their pronouns. They \nare 23 years of age, Caucasian, and currently enrolled in a master’s degree program in \nInterdisciplinary Studies, though they originally came to ASU for an advanced degree in \nMathematics before changing programs. The newest HUES recruit of the three interview \nparticipants, Pat joined HUES August 2018, and had only been matched and working \nwith their mentor for two weeks at the time of the first interview. A female-identifying \nqueer graduate student at ASU whose research interests involve the use of art in creation \nof therapeutic safe spaces for identity exploration and development, Pat’s mentor, at 27, \nhas been involved with both the university and larger local communities for over five \nyears, and is currently in a long-term relationship with a gender-conforming partner. \nThrough her relationship experience and her more extensive involvement with and \nknowledge of the local queer communities, she is both a sounding board for Pat as they \nexplore their identity and interpersonal relationships and a much-needed connection to \nthe queer community Pat has sought since arriving in Arizona. \nComing out as gender nonbinary is the latest development in Pat’s protracted \njourney of identity discovery. Pat describes their sexual identity as evolving, having first \nexperienced a same-sex relationship and subsequently identifying as bisexual in high \nschool. Through college, they identified sexually as a lesbian before settling on \n70 \nqueer/asexual/nonromantic. Of the three interview participants, Pat’s journey most \nreflects the nuances and complicated trajectories of sexual and gender identity navigation. \nParticipant 2: Neil  \nThe second interview participant, who uses the pseudonym of Neil, is a cisgender \ngay male, age 28. Neil is originally from China, where he grew up in a remote rural \nprovince before moving to Shanghai for college and the United States for graduate \nschool. Neil’s traditional rural background, where education around LGBTQ+ issues lags \nbehind that found in more progressive Chinese urban hubs and traditional, collectivist \nsocialist values and Confucian-inspired filial piety still have a strong societal hold (Cao, \nWang, & Gao, 2010; Hu & Wang, 2013), strongly shaped his earliest navigation of his \nLGBTQ+ identity. He has been in the United States since 2011, starting doctoral \nprograms at small research institutions in New York state and Boston. Two years ago, he \nfollowed his research advisor to ASU, where he completed his doctoral degree in \nComputer Science in December. Taking part in HUES since its pilot in Fall 2017, Neil \nand his mentor, an instructor with eight years’ experience at ASU, have had the longest-\nrunning match in the program. Although Neil and his mentor come from very different \ncultural backgrounds, they bonded quickly over key similarities, being the same age and \nboth coming from deeply conservative environments. Like Neil, his mentor struggled for \na long time to accept and reconcile his sexuality; having graduated from high school and \ncollege early, he excelled academically but struggled socially, never feeling he fit in. \nNow secure in his identity as a gay male and happily partnered, Neil’s mentor has been a \nstrong role model and positive influence in Neil’s life. \n \n71 \nParticipant 3: Pea   \nThe third interview participant for the HUES study is a cisgender lesbian female, \nage 25, and a doctoral student in Biological and Health Systems Engineering. For the \npurpose of this study, she selected the pseudonym of Pea. After completing her \nundergraduate coursework in China, she received her Master’s degree at a large New \nEngland public university before coming to ASU for doctorate coursework. Pea joined \nHUES at the end of Spring 2018, and had been paired and meeting with her mentor for \nfour months at the time of her first interview for this research project. Like Neil, Pea’s \nChinese culture heavily influenced the development of her LGBTQ+ identity, and she \ncontinues working to reconcile her personal identity with the cultural expectations of her \nheritage. Her mentor, age 30, is a new faculty member at ASU; although he is able to \nguide her in matters of academic career navigation, their mentorship is primarily aligned \ntoward navigation of Pea’s LGBTQ+ identity, and their relationship is more one of peers \nthan a traditional faculty-student dynamic. As a gay male in Engineering, he implicitly \nunderstands both the difficulties that LGBTQ+ students often experience in Pea’s \ntraditionally very heterocentric academic environment and the challenges in maintaining \na work-life balance in the advanced STEM fields. He has been an asset to her not only in \nnavigating the academic challenges of her chosen area of study, but provided \nencouragement and support in navigating its social currents, too. Relatively new to \nArizona, Pea’s mentor is active in both university and local LGBTQ+ communities, and \nis instrumental in pushing Pea to develop her own LGBTQ+ social networks outside the \nuniversity. \n72 \nPersonal Identity History  \n \nWhile all joined HUES in search of greater LGBTQ+ community engagement, \nthese three students varied in their level of identity development, expression, and \ncomfort. Coming into the HUES program, Pat specifically sought greater connection with \nan LGBTQ+ community, having lost a significant support system in leaving their \nprevious institution and feeling disconnected, socially, in their new one. Neil sought \nmentorship for help navigating his sexual identity and disclosure within his familial, \nsocial and academic networks, particularly given his additional cultural minority status as \na Chinese student navigating American cultural norms and expectations. Secondary \nmotivations for him were entry into an LGBTQ+ community and learning to navigate \nintimate relationships as a member of that community. Pea, while comfortable with her \nsexuality and having found acceptance with her peers within her academic program, \njoined HUES seeking support in integrating her social, academic and sexual identity \ngroup memberships and establishing greater connection within an LGBTQ+ community. \nAlthough more integrated than Neil into an American cultural paradigm, Pea, too, \nrecognized that her Chinese social conventions were sometimes a barrier to feeling as if \nshe fit in. \nPersonal History: Pat’s Story \nHaving first identified their non-heterosexual identity in high school, Pat had the \ngreatest degree of sexual and gender identity development of the three research study \nparticipants coming into the HUES program. Due to largely positive initial coming-out \nexperiences, Pat demonstrated an advanced level of self-acceptance, but navigating a new \nsocial environment at ASU has presented new challenges specifically around identity \n73 \ndisclosure. They noted during their first interview: “I think I’m mostly pretty good with \nwho I am and where I am. My problem is just in expressing that to others so they know \nwho I am, too.” Previous to arriving at ASU and subsequently joining HUES, Pat had \nbeen out for a number of years. Of their initial disclosure, they say: \nThe very first time I ever tried to, like, come out or anything was in high school, \nwhen I came out to a few friends as bisexual. I was like ‘okay, this is a thing that \nI’m going to say now’…I mean, getting there was a little weird. So like I realized \nI had a crush on a girl and I was thinking of asking her to prom. So I told two or \nthree people and they were like ‘oh yeah, cool, whatever,’ and so the first time \n[coming out] was like, ‘eh, whatever.’ Not a big deal. \n \nThe social acceptance they found in coming out reaffirmed Pat’s own early acceptance of \ntheir identities. “It didn’t freak me out,” they said, \nI think I always expected it. Even as a kid, I didn’t know the words for it but I was \nlike ‘I wouldn’t mind dating girls.’ Like…I wouldn’t mind hanging out with girls \nthe way girls are supposed to like hanging out with boys. So it was never weird, \nbecause I always suspected I liked girls.  \n \n“When I was really little,” they laughed, “I thought I was a boy.” Although they grew up \nin a fairly conservative part of Virginia, Pat did not face discrimination in their \ncommunity when they began opening up about their sexual orientation. Nonetheless, \nalthough Pat found acceptance of their emerging identity, finding peers or community \nmembers who understood the complexities of their identity was initially challenging: \nMost of the people I knew were white and straight and cisgender and didn’t know \nanything about LGBTQ stuff and were like ‘I mean, I don’t know anything about \nit, but if someone I knew was [gay], I guess I’d be fine with it. And then when \nthey [friends or members of the community] knew, they were like ‘Oh my god, \nlet’s be friends!’  So a lot of people were like that. \n \nWhile the decision to initially come out was relatively easy, Pat acknowledges that their \nearly identity development was hampered by the lack of a strong LGBTQ+ community. \nWhile the decision to come out as bisexual, then lesbian, was something experiential, \n74 \nnavigating their emerging gender identity was a more philosophical process that, at the \ntime, seemed overwhelming. Though they were not entirely comfortable with their \nfemale gender, a lack of general education around alternative genders meant Pat did not \nhave the words to express what they were internalizing at the time. \n It wasn’t until they were in college that Pat found that community. In high school, \nthey declared ‘I am this’—in college, they began to explore what it meant to be ‘this,’ \nexploring how gender and sexuality interplayed and eventually revisiting the sense of \ngender confusion they experienced during their early childhood. Pat attended a small \nliberal arts college with a high percentage of LGBTQ+ students, and that proved to be a \nmilestone in their identity development. “Over half the population that attended that \nschool is some sort of queer. Everyone that goes there ends up gay,” they laughed.  \nIt was a very diverse community. There were all sorts of identities and we were \nall pretty cool with everything. Everyone was just ‘yeah, that’s great’ and we’ll \njust keep on going being ourselves. There were so many people we could talk to \nabout all sorts of things. They were like ‘you don’t actually have to have a box. \nIt’s helpful for other people if you do, but that doesn’t really matter.’  \n \nIn that environment, Pat flourished. “[When I came out as bisexual] that was before I \nknew how many boxes there were, so I [had] said ‘I’ll choose the bisexual box for now,’” \nthey recounted. \nBut then in undergrad there was so much more to learn…it was a very different \nenvironment from where I grew up, so I learned about a lot of different identities \nand started playing around with other ones. That’s when I first started questioning \ngender identities and realized there were sexual identities beyond gay, straight, \nand bisexual, and started trying to figure out which ones might work for me. \n \nAlthough not socially outgoing, Pat quickly found themself immersed in the school’s \nqueer community, where discussions of sexuality and gender identity were the norm. \nWhere previously Pat did not have the queer social currency to describe their emerging \n75 \nidentities, Pat clearly remembered the moment they first consciously began exploring the \nnotion of gender in college: \nI was hanging out with a friend and [they] had been working on gender-queer \ntransitioning. I was like ‘oh, hey! You’re right, and these are things that apply to \nme, too.’ I had words for it now. It was between second and third sexuality and I \nwas like ‘you know, I don’t like being a girl, I’ve never been comfortable with \nbeing a girl.’ Like I said, when I was really little I thought I was a boy, but the \nidea of being a boy was never right for me…so the idea of gender never felt right. \nAnd then one day, I realized ‘oh, there are words for that.’ \n \nAs they continued exploring gender representation, Pat started dating a genderqueer peer. \n“That was when I started [really] thinking about other gender identities,” they said. “And \nI was also taking a gender theory class, so it was all very aligned, happening at the same \ntime.” The convergence of their personal and academic lives, both studying and \nexperimenting with gender and sexuality, were a liberating period during which Pat fully \ncame into their own identity for the first time. Everything “clicked” into place. \nIt’s only more recently that Pat’s LGBTQ+ self-concept has wavered. Relocating \nto Arizona for graduate school, Pat found themself isolated in a largely cisnormative \nculture for the first time since leaving for college five year previously. New to the \ninstitution and currently in an online degree program, Pat has a very limited LGBTQ+ \nnetwork. “I came to grad school last fall,” they explained. “I was struggling being in [an \nacademic] program that I didn’t really enjoy, so I was looking for something to connect \nto the school.” The transition was difficult, and shortly before entering HUES, Pat left \ntheir original academic program: \nI came in and didn’t know anyone and didn’t have any friends, and everybody \nelse knew everyone [in their small department]. I was looking for anything to find \nsomeone to connect to, because that was hard. Everybody else in my classes was a \ndude and I’m like, ‘I’m already in the minority by being female-bodied’, and that \nwould just make it [a sense of isolation] more pronounced. \n76 \n \nAfter looking for a degree program that aligned with their career interests but provided a \nsocial environment they felt would be more inclusive, Pat settled into their current area of \nstudy. This academic program has a more diverse cohort, but it came with its own \ncompromises: although Pat feels a greater affinity and alignment in social causes with \ntheir current peers, being in an online program means Pat still does not get the \nopportunity to engage socially in person with classmates. “I don’t hang out a lot,” they \nlaughed: \nI feel like I could be friends with a lot of the people in my classes now, but I’ve \nonly met a couple of them. Most of the people in my classes are in other states, so \nit’s hard to find people you both get along with and that you can also hang out \nwith in person. \n \nDescribing themself as shy and socially timid, Pat explains that at their previous \ninstitution, the existence of a robust LGBTQ+ community made finding commonality \neasy, even if they were not particularly outgoing. “The reason I made so many friends in \nundergrad was because I had two [LGBTQ+] friends and they had [LGBTQ+] friends,” \nPat explained. At ASU, Pat has difficulty in seeking out these communities. They live \nnearly twenty miles from campus, and as is the case for many graduate students, the \nuniversity is not the social hub for Pat that it was at their undergraduate institution, where \nthey lived on campus. Living in a socially conservative suburb, detached from the more \nliberal social environment of a college campus, Pat has to make a greater effort to \nconnect socially. “The only queer people I know are my mentor and like two other \npeople. I met one of them on Tinder and the other one is their fiancée,” they noted. \nBecause of their significantly reduced contact with a larger LGBTQ+ community, Pat \nfinds themself compartmentalizing their identities. While their sexual and gender \n77 \nidentities were a commonality and core component of relationships they formed at their \nundergraduate institution, they now tend to hide what had once been a significant \ncomponent of their salient identity: \nSo I think they [their social, sexual and gender identities] were a lot more \n[integrated] when I was an undergrad…they were one thing. But when I came \nhere they became a lot more separated, because there’s like other stuff going on. \nLike, I have to adult and part of adulting is having a job, and here is a place you \ncan be discriminated against because of queer identity factors. It’s more \ncompartmentalized now. \n \nTo help finance their education, Pat recently took a job as a high school mathematics \nteacher. Though they enjoy their work and feel their immediate coworkers and \nadministration “are cool”, Pat avoids socializing with their fellow teachers for fear in \nbecoming friends, their identity would eventually come up – something they can legally \nbe fired for in Arizona. \n \nAdding to Pat’s struggles is a new relationship that has challenged their \npreviously existing sexuality and gender identity. For the first time since declaring \nthemself a lesbian in college, Pat is dating a male – and this has been a source of anxiety \nand identity confusion: \nBecause every time you think you know all the boxes [of sexuality and gender \nexpression], you find out there’s more you didn’t know about. When I started to \ndate a guy [in graduate school], it was very difficult internally. Like ‘what am I \ndoing? Do I even like this person?’ All of this stuff…it’s like still sort of weird \nsometimes. It was very weird because I was like ‘I don’t know if I can do this.’ I \ndon’t like boys. It was this person, it was weird and trying to reconcile the phrase \n‘I don’t like boys’ with liking this person who happens to be a boy…that was and \nstill is very difficult and confusing. \n \nWithout an existing LGBTQ+ social network, Pat has trouble finding a community with \nwhom to process this latest wrinkle in their identity at ASU.  \n78 \nAs cisgender, heterosexual male, Pat’s partner is unable to provide the support or \nidentity navigation resources that Pat needs – or even understand the fundamental identity \nconfusion their relationship causes for Pat. Although Pat’s partner knows they identify as \nqueer and nonbinary, “he has different relationship experiences from mine, so he doesn’t \nunderstand all the nuances of dating someone queer” Pat says: \nI’m still working on how to express some of these things, so with my partner it’s \nbeen a challenge trying to figure out how to explain it in a way that’s understood \nand making sure it all comes through clearly. Sometimes, I feel like we’re making \nprogress, but there are times there’s still that lack of understanding that comes \nfrom never having dated a queer person.  \n \nPat’s partner’s lack of familiarity with and ability to fully embrace and support their \nidentity is challenging both in terms of Pat’s identity self-concept and their relationship. \n“I think he tries,” they explain, “but he struggles a lot with the language of it because I \nuse they/them pronouns and there’s a lot of those times where he’s never had to use that \nbefore.” As a result, Pat faces frequent, though unintentional, microagressions from both \ntheir partner and mutual friends: \nThere was one really weird experience I had [recently]. We went to the state fair \nand met up with one of [their partner’s] coworkers there, and like because he \n[their partner] doesn’t know how to talk about it, he just defaults back to what \nhe’d been like in past relationships…so he was married before, so he was used to \ntalking about ‘the wife’ and he’d go to say that and be like ‘oh, no, we’re not \nmarried’. And like, insert ‘girl’ instead of ‘wife’.  \n \nBeing unsure how to navigate the dynamics of their sexuality and gender identity in terms \nof the relationship, Pat compartmentalizes their identities when they are with their \npartner. For instance, though the two of them have discussed Pat’s nonbinary identity and \nwhat it means in terms of their relationship dynamic, Pat worries that he does not \nunderstand their identity beyond a superficial level. From his perspective, the relationship \n79 \nis largely a heteronormative one save for the use of different gender pronouns, and \nsexuality and gender roles are largely fixed. For Pat, though, the interplay between \nsexuality and gender identity – and specifically the gendered expression of sexuality – are \nfar more nuanced.  \n Being female-bodied and in a relationship with a cisgender, straight male \nconstantly problematizes coming out to new people, too. When the two of them are \ntogether, people automatically assume them to be a cisgender, heterosexual couple. “I \nkeep thinking that I should [explain their relationship dynamic], and then not doing it…” \nPat explains. Pat expresses frustration at having to correct assumptions or ‘teach’ people \nwhat it means to be nonbinary or explain their relationship dynamics; this limits the \ndegree that they want to share the personal details of their life with others. This is a sharp \ncontrast to their undergraduate years, when the nuances of identity and sexuality were \nsignificantly easier to explain; here, they find few people understand their gender \nidentity. Being the only nonbinary person in the room at any given time burdens Pat with \na sense of responsibility:  \nIt’s like ‘do I really want to explain why I want these pronouns or what this \nperson means if this person doesn’t know [about nonbinary genders]?’ On the one \nhand, yes, I can tell you about my experiences of this, but there are other \nexperiences and I know you’re capable of using the internet…it’s just \nlike…weird…that all of the responsibility has to fall on one person [to educate \nothers].  \n \nMost of the people Pat comes out to now are people who “already know things about” \nbeing nonbinary, they say.  \nPeople I come out to will just be ‘hey, just checking in on you. Are these still the \npronouns you are using? Where are your identities at right now?’ And it’s easiest \nto just go ‘well, here’s my identity update’ or I’ll meet someone who knows \n80 \nsomething [about gender expression] and they’ll be like ‘hey, what are your \npronouns?’ and I’ll be ‘I’m this’.  \n \nThe prevailing conservative sociopolitical values of the area are a constant factor in Pat’s \nlife and decisions to come out, too. Attending an institution with such a strongly \nLGBTQ+ friendly culture meant Pat never feared coming out to people. Since moving to \nArizona, though, they are far more reluctant to disclose their identity:   \nI’ll be like ‘I don’t know enough about them to know where they’ll fall on the \nspectrum of reactions’. Like if I tell this person ‘hey, these are my pronouns,’ will \nthey be ‘hey, okay,’ or will they be like ‘why, blah, blah, blah?’ So a lot of the \nconcerns are around figuring out where they fall on that, how much they would \nknow.  \n \nThe decision to come out now carries far greater consequence, they say. “It’s a bit \noverwhelming,” they explain.  \n \n \nPersonal History: Neil’s Story \n Of the three participants in the research study, Neil demonstrated the least \nintegrated LGBTQ+ identity when he first joined the HUES project. Growing up in rural \nChina with little exposure to an LGBTQ+ community or culture, Neil had difficulty \nreconciling his sexual identity with Chinese societal expectation or the traditional views \nof masculinity associated with his culture (see Slootmaeckers & Lievens, 2014). He \naccepts his sexual orientation, but still has trouble embracing it. He has had a particularly \ndifficult time coming to terms with what being gay means in terms of his larger identity, \nand struggles to let go of heteronormative attitudes and pervasive stereotypes about gay \nmen and the LGBTQ+ community common to his cultural upbringing. Without \nacculturation into a larger LGBTQ+ group identity, he distanced himself from what he \nconsidered “feminine” gay culture or behavior. Up until recently, he took pride in not \n81 \nfitting gay stereotypes. In his first interview, he said he did not want his sexual \norientation to define his identity:  \nNone of my culture or values are different [from heterosexual peers]. In fact, \nwhen I told some of my closest male friends, they were quite surprised. They \nnever expected me to be gay because I am like them…because my actions, my \nbehavior is very like my friends [heteronormative].  I think gays can be more like \nthe straight people.  \n \nOnly out to one family member back in China, Neil’s exposure to other gay men was \nlargely limited to online chatrooms, forums, and dating apps – something that coming to \nthe United State for graduate study did not change. When he joined HUES, Neil had only \ncome out to several of his closest friends. \n Though he is learning to embrace his sexual identity and expresses an eagerness \nto learn more about the LGBTQ+ community, Neil’s formative years were frustrating; \nwhereas in Western society, between 6% and 10% of society identity as LGBTQ+, that \nrate is estimated to be closer to 2% to 4% in China (Cao, Wang & Gao, 2010). A lack of \nLGBTQ+ peers, in combination with a societal historical predisposition to marginalizing \nor ignoring LGBTQ+ issues (Hu & Wang, 2013), meant that he had nobody with whom \nto share his feelings of difference and confusion.  “Back home, in middle school or high \nschool,” he recounts, \nWhat confused me was that I liked or loved the girl who was sitting next to me in \nseventh grade, but after that I never loved a girl again. I also knew I loved to look \nat very handsome boys in high school…but we were in a very small town and [I \ndidn’t] have access to that [exposure to LGBTQ+ communities]. It was a \nfrustrating thing. Because I liked a girl but then suddenly I had no interest in girls. \n[I wondered] why did I suddenly have an interest in boys, in guys? That’s very \nfrustrating: why? What happened to me? To these are the question marks in my \nhead. They’re still in my head. \n \nIn traditional Chinese culture, he explains: \n82 \nPeople didn’t really talk about that…it’s like the elephant in the room. They must \nknow that men love men, but they never talk about it…the majority of people [in \nChina] won’t take it seriously or don’t want to acknowledge it. That’s what I \nwould say is a violence from the majority. \n \nNeil experienced acute distress, wondering why he couldn’t be more like his peers.  \nYou feel so isolated, right, in terms of identity. You feel you are the outsider...you \nare so different from others. You wonder if there is something wrong with you, \nyou must have some questions of this nature [without anyone to verify you are not \nalone in your identity]. You don’t dare to ask others, right? You don’t dare.  \n \nEven now, talking about the isolation and confusion he felt growing up different is a \ndifficult and emotional topic for Neil, and his recollection of the time – and of the \nChinese culture of which this was a product – is tinged with resentment.  \n Like Pat, Neil first found opportunities to explore his identity in college. For \ncollege, he moved to Shanghai, one of China’s largest and most metropolitan centers. \n“After getting to college, I started looking for people like me,” he explained. But even \nthough Shanghai is relatively cosmopolitan, he still found few openly or visibly gay \npeers:  \nI got to know some other gay people, but I think they are also very closed \n[closeted]. They do not want to be open to their straight friends. Not many people \ncome out in China. \n \nComing out to his heterosexual peers to process his orientation and identity was out of \nthe question, so he turned to the internet, where he finally began finding the resources \nand connection he was looking for: \nI was mainly looking for resources online. I would search ‘gay’ or something like \nthat, and read those articles about gays. Doing that, you know there are also a \ngroup of people who look like you and are like you. You discover that there is a \nforum out there and that people – gay people – are looking for friends, and \nsomething like that. So you just chat with them. \n \n83 \nEven then, Neil didn’t meet up with other gay men in public or come out to peers. “I \n[didn’t] want others to find out that I’m a gay,” he explained. “That I’m different from \nthem.” Even among his closest friends (generally other Chinese students, even once in \nthe United States), his sexuality was a subject he was unwilling to discuss. As a result, \nNeil became accustomed to maintaining strict boundaries between his personal and \nacademic identities. “I still feel like my professional identity is more central than my gay \nidentity,” he noted in an early interview. “I think we are more defined by the \ncontributions that we have done, and that is more relevant to life than [a] gay identity.” \nIt wasn’t until arriving at ASU that Neil started slowly coming out to peers. The \nloneliness of not having anyone to confide in was becoming problematic for him, as it \nwas increasing difficult to maintain his compartmentalized identities. A landmark \nmoment for Neil was the day he finally found the courage – bolstered by frustration – to a \nfriend:  \nThe first time, the very first time was a female student in my lab. I was super \nnervous, even shaking. I didn’t know how to tell her. I [had fallen] in love with a \nstraight guy and could not focus on my work. He sits very close to my office, and \nI got interrupted and just can’t focus [anymore]. I [was] struggling, and really \nwanted to talk. I felt safe talking to her. \n \nWhen she reassured him that he had her support, then surprised Neil by confiding her \nown bisexuality, he felt encouraged to open up to other close friends. Eventually, he even \nconfessed his feelings to the friend he had developed romantic feelings for. Looking \nback, Neil refers to this as a monumental milestone: “I decided to do something. So I told \nhim, first of all, that I am gay, and that I like him and that I know there is no way we can \nbe together.” In another surprise, his disclosure was met with empathy, not rejection: “he \ntold me a personal story of telling another girl that he liked the girl and she rejected him,” \n84 \nNeil marveled. In reassuring Neil that his friendship wasn’t going to be rejected, his \nlabmate showed a level of support Neil did not anticipate. \n The encouragement Neil received from his peers upon coming out kindled a new \ndetermination to embrace his sexuality. Shortly thereafter, he joined HUES and began \nopening up about his sexuality to more of his closest peers. “I’m becoming more and \nmore open-minded about this,” he explained during his first interview. “So if my close \nfriends ask me about my [relationship] status and if I am looking for a girl, I tell them \n‘no, I’m looking for boys.’” Finding that his predominantly Chinese peer group accepted \nand normalized his identity was revelatory:  \nAll of them don’t act very surprised [or concerned]. First of all, they are of my \nage, so they are getting more exposure to gay culture and community, and they \ncan understand me and show me their support, actually. \n \nThough less concerned about the reactions he’ll receive now, Neil remains cautious about \nwhom he comes out to.  \nPersonal History: Pea’s story \nLike Neil, Pea grew up in China, coming to the United State for graduate school \njust three years ago. She joined HUES to learn to better navigate entry and acculturation \ninto an LGBTQ+ community. Pea displayed significant integration of her sexual and \ninterpersonal and academic identities when she joined HUES, having come out to both \npeers and friends starting in college. Though she still had not disclosed her orientation to \nfaculty or advisors up through her first graduate degree, she came out immediately to her \nfaculty advisor upon arriving at ASU. \n Although growing up as a sexual minority in rural China was a hardship, Pea \nharbors none of the cultural resentment Neil demonstrates, shrugging off the difficulty \n85 \nnow and noting “I think that’s society and just how the environment is.” Whereas Neil \ndid not explore his sexuality until leaving home for college, Pea embraced her sexuality \nmuch earlier, initiating a romantic relationship with a peer in high school. Like Pat, she \nsays she first realized she was different from other girls at a young age – specifically, the \nthird grade: “I can’t remember, exactly [what made her realize her sexuality],” she \nlaughed. “But I’ve been gay ever since….always gay!” At that age, she says, the full \nsocietal and familial implications of her identity didn’t occur to her. “It was like ‘oh, \nokay,’” she recalled. “I think I was too young to realize the significance.”  \n Although she accepted and began exploring her sexuality at an early age, Pea’s \njourney was far from easy. Knowing she was gay and being gay were two different \nscenarios, she observed. “In high school, when my teachers and other people were about \nto find out, it was a scene,” she recalls. Facing the same cultural barriers to same-sex \nrelationships as Neil, she did not disclose her identity or attractions to others.  \nI was pretty comfortable [with her identity]. I think I began to realize through \nmiddle school to high school [that others might be hostile toward her due to her \nsexual identity]. Even then I wasn’t threatened by it because it covers up pretty \nwell and I wasn’t in a relationship…so I was like ‘I am safe.’ But then I got into a \nrelationship [and became more cautious]. I might not always have been \ncomfortable thinking how people would treat me [if] they know, or how they treat \nlesbian and gay people. I [wasn’t] comfortable with that. Two days ago, there was \nthis news story that a high school teacher that was openly gay was kicked out [of \nhis job] for his orientation, so it’s still pretty dreadful. \n \nPea was the only interview participant in the study to note an explicitly homophobic \nenvironment growing up. She has particularly vivid memories of one homophobic teacher \nin high school:  \nHigh school was a nightmare. Every class had a sort of [head] teacher in charge. \n[He was] pretty hostile against being gay, and I could feel that from him…I’m \n86 \nstill not happy about that, I’m still pretty mad, because I don’t feel like I was \nrespected. \n \nAlthough he never singled out Pea directly, she found out many years later from former \nclassmates that he did in fact make derogatory assumptions about her sexuality, spreading \nrumors about her orientation even years later. His comments about the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity continue to haunt Pea, as does the possibility of hearsay about her sexuality \nreaching her family in the small community, where social interdependence is a byproduct \nof China’s collectivist national mindset and where common knowledge of her LGBTQ+ \nidentity could bring family dishonor.  \n Although Pea embraced her identity, her first relationship was a tentative, often \nconfusing period, being the first same-sex romantic relationship for both girls. Not having \nan LGBTQ+ support network made navigating it especially challenging. “It was about a \nyear and a half,” she recalls.  Being in the closet, she had nobody to turn to for \nrelationship advice: \nI [didn’t] know what’s going on. I hadn’t quite figured out what to look for in a \nrelationship, and I probably pressured the girl too much…we fought a lot. I didn’t \nknow how to communicate my needs. That’s how everything went wrong…we \nhad a lot of fights and arguments about small things, and I got pretty emotional \nand couldn’t control my anger and just started shutting her out.  \nHad she the resources, support, or strong role modeling in navigating the relationship, \nPea says, that relationship might have turned out differently. “I thought relationships \nwould be like the [heterosexual] relationships on TV and in the novels,” she recalled. “It \nwasn’t like that. It [was] hard work.” \n The period wasn’t only difficult because of the end of the relationship, but also \nbecause for the first time, she felt her secret was threatened:  \n87 \nI think everyone could tell I wasn’t happy at the time. There’s a breakup and it’s \nso hard to hide the emotions…when people saw the emotional breakdown, they \nbegan to suspect because it’s not like what happens when you’re just close \nfriends. I was crying a lot, and didn’t have the appetite to eat, and I couldn’t focus \non my studies. It was probably one of the toughest times I’ve had. \n \nCompounding Pea’s challenge was the loss of important friendships and support when \nshe did come out subsequent to the end of the relationship. Finding it impossible to deal \nwith the emotional burden of the breakup on her own, she confided in a friend she felt \nsafe sharing with. This didn’t go the way she hoped, though: \nThe hardest part for me was because I was having a hard time and needed to find \nsomeone to talk [to] about it. I went to my best friend at the time, who I hadn’t \ncome out to…but she pulled back. So that was hard for me, struggling in both the \nrelationship and the friendship. \n \nThough her friendship eventually recovered and Pea still sees her friend, who is also \nstudying in the US now, the experience left her unnerved. \n Like Neil, Pea moved away from her small community after high school. Unlike \nNeil, though, she found an environment in which LGBTQ+ identities were not so \nsuppressed. “People started talking about [LGBTQ+ subjects],” she said, and the greater \nvisibility and acknowledgement of the LGBTQ+ community bolstered her own sense of \nsupport. “I still wasn’t out, but people suspected. And someone would just ask me \nstraight, and that straightforwardedness made me feel it was okay to talk about.” Though \nstill tentative about disclosure, she started finding the confidence to come out to those in \nher social circle: “For those who didn’t approach me [asking if she was gay], I wasn’t \nvoluntarily telling them…but for the people that I told, I got support.” This, she said, \n“was nicer…more liberating.” \n88 \n Two incidents during college were particularly affirming and instrumental to \nPea’s developing confidence in disclosing her sexual orientation. The first of these \nincidents occurred during her first year: \nI was in a long-distance relationship and I was talking to my girlfriend a lot on the \nphone in the hallways in the dorm. And then my classmate just from across the \nhallway came over [one time] and she was like ‘hey, was that your girlfriend?’ \nAnd she seemed completely accepting and okay. That was a huge relief of ‘oh, I \ncan talk to you about it.’ I was a little intimidated at the time and I played it cool \nlike ‘naw, it’s just a friend,’ but later on I was like…I came out to her less than a \nweek later. \nAfter this, Pea started coming out to other friends. Additionally, disclosure resulted in an \nunexpected bonus: not only was she accepted when she came out to her classmate, but it \nstrengthened her friendship with the girl and, in doing so, helped her find a broader \nsupport network: “I hung out with them [the girl and her friends] a lot more than I hung \nout with anyone else, and they became my closest friends throughout college.” After \nkeeping her sexuality a closely-guarded secret for so long, Pea was finally able to be \ncompletely herself among her friends. \n Pea’s second revelatory moment occurred several years later, when she was \nbefriended by an openly gay visitor to her university and had her first glimpse of a larger \nLGBTQ+ community:  \n I met this American guy who was gay. He helped me come to terms a lot \nunderstanding what life would be like [living as an out lesbian in the larger \ncommunity], and he was also the one who gave me the idea that I should probably \ncheck out America, come over here. \n \nThough she had a supportive social circle, this was Pea’s first opportunity to learn about \nthe perspectives and experiences of not only other LGBTQ+ peers, but their families and \n89 \nthe broader social dynamics of a LGBTQ+ community she had only tangentially been a \npart of up to this point: \nHe’s also married, so to see someone who had been through all that stuff [was \nimpactful]. And then his sister, who was the visiting scholar, is lesbian and her \nson is gay, and so we talked about how she accepted it. And she cried when we \ntalked about it, so it was definitely hard for her at the time, and I’m seeing what \nan emotional process it could be, yet how it could turn out to be good. \n \nIn befriending the visiting Americans, Pea, who had always been the minority in her \nlargely heterosexual social circle, began to understand the value of being part of an \nLGBTQ+ community. Knowing opportunities to do so were still rare in China, she \nconsidered following the visiting scholar’s advice and considered relocating to the United \nStates for the next stage of her life. Though her decision to study in the US was not solely \nbased on the opportunity to experience life in a more open, accepting society, she admits \n“it’s a huge factor.”  \n Once in the United States, Pea felt able to embrace her identity more openly. \nAttending a major East Coast public university for her Master’s degree, Pea met \nLGBTQ+ peers. One peer in particular, a lesbian woman from Australia, was particularly \nimpactful. With this friend’s guidance, Pea gained confidence in navigating the dynamics \nof LGBTQ+ communities and relationships – two key areas she recognized were growth \nopportunities for her. While she had long had the support of her primarily straight peers, \nthis was the first time Pea met a fellow lesbian her own age who had overcome many of \nthe social obstacles and fears she’d been dealing with. This peer’s success in overcoming \nthese obstacles was empowering and affirming, and her stories resonated with Pea:   \nI could talk to her about things with her….I was afraid to ask girls out to date, and \nI think at the time I really wanted to date this girl really bad but didn’t know how, \n90 \nso I came to her for advice. [One time] we were talking at a bar and she pointed \nout ‘you need to be confident in yourself.’ \n \nHaving a confidante who could understand what she was going through was a \nbreakthrough: \nShe [her Australian lesbian friend] said that when she was in Australia she met \nthis Indian guy who was really shy. He grew out of it, and now they’re best \nfriends. Her mentioning that…something just hit me, like a hope. She sort of \nbelieved in me at the time. I didn’t believe in myself, and she made me realize it. \n \nPea’s friendship with the Australian lesbian not only assisted her entry into a larger \nLGBTQ+ community, but encouraged her to come out to more peers, including her larger \ndepartmental cohort:  \nShe…man, one time…one time I came to her for sexual advice, and she \nbroadcasted it to the whole cohort. She was so proud of herself, saying ‘hey, she \ncame to me for sexual advice!’ and I was like ‘um, what?’” \n \nThough initially wary of how her peers would react, the incident quickly cemented \nsupport from their peers around Pea’s identity. Although some knew she was gay at that \npoint, she made a point of never broadcasting her identity for fear that though accepting \nof her sexuality, her peers might not be comfortable knowing the more intimate details of \nher life – likely a byproduct of the same cultural aversion to discussing sexual and gender \nidentity noted by Neil. After that disclosure, though, she realized she was really just one \nof the group, and her romantic life was as much fair conversational game as anyone \nelse’s. Not only were her peers accepting, but they started actively playing matchmaker, \ntrying to help Pea “hook up” with other lesbian girls they knew. “That was a huge step \nfor me,” she laughs. “I’ll admit it.” \n Even now, though, Pea occasionally struggles with components of her identity. \nThough she is open about her identity to those she is closest in her academic and social \n91 \ncircles, including the close-knit Chinese student community she is a part of, she still \nexperiences uncertainty around disclosure. These days, she says, she is “not consciously \nhiding it, but I’m not necessarily showing it. But with people I’m close to I’m pretty \nopen.” More critically, though, although she is more comfortable disclosing her identity \nto others, she still struggles to connect with other members of the LGBTQ+ community, \nwomen particularly: \nI don’t think I’ve figured out my full identity yet. It’s not just the gay part. Even \nthough I project [myself as] fairly confident, I don’t feel confident all the time. \nThere might be something deep down I haven’t figured out. I don’t know how to \ninteract with people in the [lesbian] community…dating culture can be super \nconfusing.  \nPre-mentorship: Nondisclosure, Anxiety and Isolation from Family \n \n Over the course of the nine interviews, a dominant emergent theme was the direct \ncorrelation between level of disclosure and intimacy of familial relationships. While each \nparticipant has attempted to come out to family members, perceived non-acceptance by \nthose family members has curbed further attempts to disclose. Disclosure to their families \n(and particularly parents) is important to all three research participants, and continued \nnondisclosure is a significant stressor to each of them. However, none feel they can \ncurrently navigate those conversations. One participant, Pat, acknowledges that \ndifferences in sexual or gender identity are accepted, if not understood or embraced, \nwithin both their community and their family. However, their family’s lack of \ncomprehension and inability to appreciate the significance of gender and sexuality to \nPat’s larger identity leaves Pat hesitant to share their live with their parents more fully. \nFor both Neal and Pea, homosexuality is still very much a cultural taboo, and each feels \nthat disclosure carries too many risks to the reputations of their families; at the same time, \n92 \nthe longstanding Chinese cultural value of filial piety has instilled in each of them a keen \naversion to dishonoring or disappointing their families. As a result, all have strategically \ndistanced themselves from their families, straining these relationships and causing \nconsiderable distress to themselves in the process.  \nNondisclosure, Anxiety, and Isolation: Pat’s Story  \nFor Pat, the primary challenge in coming out involves the complications of both \nsexual orientation and gender identity. Although their parents were accepting when Pat \ndisclosed their sexual orientation in high school, it bothered Pat at the time that compared \nto the robust conversations coming out triggered among their college friends, their \nadmission was taken nonchalantly by their parents.  \n “I didn’t come out to my parents until I had my first queer relationship.” They \ncontinued: \nI was like ‘I’m gay’. I figured it would be easier for them to understand the end \nrather than anything in between [the self-discovery process]. They both were like \n‘that’s fine, whatever.’ I was like ‘no, you don’t understand. You need to educate \nyourselves. So I tried to give them resources. \n \nThough supportive, their parents did not provide the sense of validation Pat yearned for; \ncontent to accept Pat’s sexuality without expressing a need to understand it more or \n“educate” themselves, Pat found them increasingly difficult to relate to; though \nsuperficially accepting of Pat’s sexuality, Pat sensed that it was just something they \ndidn’t want to talk about. Pat’s relationship with their father is strained by what Pat \nattributes to a fundamental lack of empathy and an inability to comprehend the \nsignificance Pat’s identity plays in their life. “He likes Trump,” they explain: \nI used to be really close to my dad, and then the 2016 election happened, so it’s \n[the relationship] been a little more strained…he doesn’t equate like, things that \n93 \nare in his personal life, he doesn’t know how to translate that to the outside world. \nSo in his mind he probably thinks it’s okay to be supportive of me and like rude to \nothers [LGBTQ+ individuals]. I don’t think the empathy thing quite equates to the \noutside.  \n \nTo some degree, Pat has reconciled with their mother and currently has a stronger \nrelationship, though Pat does not characterize it as close. Pat still does not offer \ninformation on their life freely: “[These days] I don’t tell them things unless they ask. \nLike my mom maybe once a year will ask if I’m dating anyone and I’ll be like ‘yeah, I’ve \nbeen seeing this person for nine months’ and she’ll be like ‘oh.’”  \n Because of what they perceived as their parents’ lack of empathy and connection, \nboth when they initially disclosed their sexual orientation and currently, Pat is hesitant to \ndisclose their gender identity to them. They know it may come up in the future, but it \nisn’t a conversation they look forward to: “It’ll…be interesting,” Pat explains. A further \nbarrier to identity disclosure is the general lack of understanding within society around \nalternate genders or genderqueer individuals, like Pat, who identify as neither male nor \nfemale. This barrier is further magnified by their current relationship. Currently dating a \ncisgender male, Pat fears that the appearance of being in a heteronormative relationship \nwill ‘undo’ any development of understanding their parents might have of their identity: \nBecause I’m dating a guy now, that’s confusing to my mom, and I still haven’t \ntold my dad…he has a very conservative viewpoint on a lot of things, so that \ncould be difficult. It’s like people always expect you to pick a thing and that’s the \nthing you’re going to be for the rest of your life. \n \nPat has never been able to have a frank discussion about sexuality and identity in broader \nterms with their parents, and fears disclosure of their relationship with a cisgender male \nnow would present a setback to the future conversations they know they’ll need to have \naround gender identity.  \n94 \nPat, who suffers extreme anxiety and depressive symptoms that become \nmagnified by stressors such as confrontation or family interactions, now actively avoids \nall situations in which they might have to acknowledge their current relationship status, to \nthe point of keeping their now year-long relationship a secret. “I know I’m going to my \nsister’s wedding next year,” they stated, “but I don’t know if I’m taking the person I’m \nwith now or anybody at all.” This reluctance to discuss their sexual and gender identities \nmakes family holidays particularly stressful:  \nThey don’t know that [their boyfriend] and I are dating, only that we are living in \na house together, so [the Thanksgiving holiday] will be interesting. [Relationship \nstatus] is gonna come up. I’m bringing him with me because I don’t want to go \nalone, so it’s gonna be interesting…it’s going to be fun. \n \nNondisclosure, Anxiety, and Isolation: Neil’s Story \n Discomfort in navigating identity has resulted in strategic distancing from family \nfor Neil, too. Neil, who started to realize he was attracted to other boys in his classes in \nmiddle school and high school, told his mother he was gay after going to college in \nShanghai and then starting graduate school in the United States, where exposure to \nvisible LGBTQ+ communities allowed him to begin coming to terms with and \nunderstanding his identity. “I just told her,” he said. “I told my mother that I love boys.” \nImmediately, though, she had attempted to minimize his disclosure: \nShe thinks it’s just my heavy load of study [distracting him from spending time \nwith and dating women], and tells me I should just try being with girls. The thing \nabout my mother, she still loves me. She didn’t get very angry or get very \noutrageous or anything…[but] she would never bring it up after we talked about \nit. \n \nAlthough this initial reaction was not as bad as he’d feared it might be, subsequent \nconversations have left Neil more uncertain about coming out to other family members. \n95 \nOptimistic when he first came out to his mother, he is now concerned about the impact \nhis sexual identity could have on his family: \nEven when I [try to] talk to my mom about me being gay, it [ends up being] about \nhow I expected others to look at us. And I really feel a conflict there. I really \nwant…I don’t want to hide, but on the other hand, I don’t want my parents to be \nhurt by the gossip. \n \nIn China – and particularly in the rural province where Neil’s family lives – having a gay \nson is still a source of social shame, as noted elsewhere by Hu and Wang (2013), and this \nweighs heavily on his mother. “She says ‘what do you want us to do?’” he continued, \nexplaining:  \nHer concern was more like if the relatives or other people know that I’m \ngay…they feel it’s a shame and it’s a small town, so if one person knows, then \nother people know, and people [would] just gossip about this…and she cannot \nbear with this type of gossip.  \n \nFear of ill-treatment of his family keeps Neil disclosing his identity with other family \nmembers or close friends back in China. It’s his responsibility, he says, to “protect” them \nfrom the shame his being gay would bring to the family and the notoriety it would bring \nthem in their small community. He is adamant that he cannot come out to his father, \nsaying “he has a heart condition, so I cannot tell him,” and Neil fears the stress of the \nsocial ostracism his family might face would be too much a burden given his father’s \ndelicate health. Neil elaborates:   \nI don’t want them to be discriminated against by their friends…most of my \nrelatives are not very well educated [in regards to social issues], so they are not \nreally exposed to this LGBTQ thing, so that’s one of my concerns. \n \nHaving come to the United States seven years ago, Neil has only returned to China and \nseen his family three times. Chief among his reasons for remaining in the United States is \nthe stress and anxiety that the prospect of returning home triggers, and the associated fear \n96 \nthat he might inadvertently jeopardize his parents’ reputations and standing among their \nfamily. “The problem with Chinese culture,” he explains, is why he stays away: \nThere is a lot of family time. People will ask me why I don’t find a girl when I go \nback to China, [and] my parents and relatives ask why I am still single. I cannot \ntell them the real reason for that. That’s always a struggle for me…I don’t think \nit’s fair to tell others about my real thinking. \n \nHis family, not knowing why he won’t come home, still ask him to return frequently, \nparticularly around traditional holidays; coming up with excuses, such as being busy with \nhis studies, feels disingenuous to Neil, and he hates what he views as necessary \ndeception. With the upcoming Chinese New Year, for instance, he knows that if he \nreturns home, there will be a very large family gathering: \n[A]ll kinds of relatives [come] together. So there will be a lot of awkward \nquestions. Like ‘why are you still single?’. And if you are not single they will ask \nwhen you will get married. And if you are married they will ask when you will \nhave kids. When you have a first kid they will ask when you will have the next \nkid. They keep asking those sorts of questions. It’s a lot of pressure, actually…I \ntry to ignore them. I just don’t answer. I don’t know why, but they don’t really \nrespect the personal [boundaries], they keep asking you. It’s one thing I don’t like \n[about going home].  \n \nIncreasingly, Neal finds navigating Chinese cultural norms frustrating. The easiest \nsolution for Neil is to remain in the US, where he can complete his studies, build a career, \nand not have to worry about his father’s health or his mother’s concerns about relatives \nlearning he is gay.  \nNondisclosure, Anxiety, and Isolation: Pea’s Story  \nLike both Pat and Neil, Pea attempted to come out to her family, but received an \ninitial reaction less encouraging than she’d hoped for. This has discouraged her from \nsubsequent attempts. The first time she broached the subject with her father was shortly \nbefore leaving for graduate school in the United States, and the outcome of that \n97 \nconversation left a lasting impact on Pea. “I tried to talk to my dad about it once, because \nI feel like he’s the more liberal one in the family,” she explained: \nAnd when he was driving me to the airport, I said ‘Dad, can I talk to you about \nsomething?’ And I was like ‘I don’t think I’ve ever liked a boy before.’ I think \nthat was pretty subtle but I saw him kind of frozen for a second. And then he was \nlike ‘maybe you just haven’t met the right one yet’. That was what he said.  \n \nThis attempt at disclosure resonated with her: “He froze. And I can’t ever remember a \ntime that he froze. So I was like ‘I’m not ready for this talk yet’ and maybe they’re not, \neither.” \n As in Neil’s case, the initial conversation around her sexuality was the only one \nshe has had, as her father has never brought the matter back up, and she now fears \ndisappointing him. Like Neil, she also bears the heavy emotional burden of filial piety \nand responsibility to her family. Until very recently, Pea’s mother was the caregiver for \nher grandparents, who “weren’t in good shape.” Pea felt she had too many “things on her \nmind” to be distracted by her daughter’s disclosure. \n After her father’s response, Pea also worries about what might happen when she \ntells the rest of her family she is a lesbian:  \n I think my mom will keep crying for weeks or months, maybe. It will be pretty \nhard on them. On the one hand, their expectations fall apart, and [also, on the \nother], they have all this social pressure on them because their daughter is still \nnot getting married, possibly a lesbian, all the rumors that way… \n \nAs much as she fears disappointing her parents, maintaining her secret is problematic, \ntoo. “It’s a small town,” she says. Even though she has been gone for some time now, she \nknows there is still speculation amongst her previous schoolmates and teachers about her \nsexuality, as a peer recently confirmed to her. “That’s also a reason I would want to talk \nto my parents as soon as I can,” she says, “because I don’t want them to hear elsewhere.” \n98 \nShe knows her parents are concerned for her wellbeing, and is conflicted over whether \ncoming out or maintaining her secret will ultimately cause them more pain. “I don’t know \nhow to phrase it, how to alleviate some of their concerns, how to cope with it.” Normally \nupbeat, the subject saddens Pea, and she becomes introspective. Like Neal, the idea of \ndeceiving her family is deeply distasteful and shameful to Pea: \n Thinking about it is kind of hard…I just don’t know where to start…how to \nbring it up to them. Because I’ve been lying for a while now. I don’t know how \nthey will take it. At first [the challenge] will be the gayness, and then it’ll be me \nlying. I don’t…yeah. Then they might want to send me [away].  \n \nAlthough she yearns to tell them she is gay, and knows the betrayal felt by her parents \nwill only grow the longer she maintains her secret, she doesn’t know how to come out at \nthis point. The burden of indecision wears on her: \nIt’s definitely something I want to solve. It’s something on the back of my mind \n[all the time], but I don’t know how [to come out]. I don’t know how to plant the \nseed, because I’ve never been the diplomatic type, or someone who really knows \nhow to comfort my parents. It’s actually a huge conflict to their beliefs and \nvalues. \n \nHer studies and career plans give her an excuse to postpone conversations around \nher long-term life plans, but her advancing age and associated cultural expectations – in \ntraditional Chinese society, marriage is still viewed as a “mandatory duty” with \n“important social implications”, according to Hu and Wang (2013) – are still a major \nsource of this anxiety. “I’m nearly thirty, and I can’t do this after I turn thirty. The age of \ngetting married [in China] is definitely getting older, but it’s still an expectation to get \nmarried.” Though she laughs about the pressure her family places on her to ‘settle down’, \nshe then turns serious. The idea of coming out to her family is “pretty hard,” she said,  \n99 \nbecause it’s just conservative and all the expectations are that I find a guy. That’s \nmy mom’s frame, I would say…she definitely lives on that. Every time I call her, \nthat’s something she will bring up, probably once a week. \n \nBecause of the emotional difficulty of these conversations, Pea finds herself dreading the \nweekly phone calls with her mother. “I like…I’ll just be like ‘I know, mom, I’ll try \nharder,” she says when her mother asks if she’s met someone or is dating. “I [won’t \nreally] acknowledge it. I’ll find excuses like ‘I’m too busy and I couldn’t find someone \nwho fits, which is true, but also not true.”  \nLike Neil, Pea fears that she may never be comfortable returning to China after \nthe acceptance and exposure to LGBTQ+ community she has found in the United States. \nAlthough she has not decided whether to return to China or remain in the US after \ncompleting her degree, a significant factor in her decision to leave China was the freedom \nshe would find from familial and social pressure. Here, though she still worries about her \nfamily finding out she is gay, the fear that they will find out on terms not her own are \nlessened. “That [the fear of being involuntarily outed] was the hard part…hardest part,” \nshe says of her high school and college years. “I was living close to family, and family \nwas going to find out. [So] after high school I moved to a different city.” Moving away \nfor college alleviated the anxiety. “It wasn’t an imminent issue anymore,” she explained. \nWhen it came time for graduate school, the freedom to further explore her identity \nwithout worrying about her family finding out about her sexuality from others “was a \nhuge factor”.  \n Like Neil, her fears of how society would treat her family were another factor that \nled Pea to develop not only a physical distance from her family, but an emotional one, \ntoo. Returning to China, where she would face more constant questions from family and \n100 \nacquaintances about her life, she “would feel more constrained, insecure, and probably \nhide it more,” she noted:  \nBeing gay is something I have embraced. Being comfortable in the workplace, \nbeing open about or not holding back about my sexual orientation at work [is \nsomething I want]. I’d definitely more open to staying here than going back. It \nseems things will be tougher going home. \n \nHaving had the opportunity to develop healthy relationships within her community and \nbuild a positive self-concept for herself as a lesbian have become important to Pea, \nsomething her time in the US has only reaffirmed. \nPre-mentorship: Identity, Nondisclosure and Social Isolation \n \n A second recurrent theme among all three research study participants is the \nimpact their sexual orientation or gender identities have had in their social lives. \nSpecifically, all three note that significant insecurities around disclosure or nondisclosure \nof these identities and ‘otherness’ have hampered development of friendships and close \nrelationships with their peers, both intentionally and otherwise.  \nIdentity, Nondisclosure, and Social Isolation: Pat’s Story \nFor Pat, a perennial challenge is a lack of understanding of gender identities \namong the general public. In their case, the general anxieties of coming out are \ncompounded by the necessity of explaining their identities. This is particularly when they \nthemselves are still grappling with the shifting intersections of their gender and sexual \nidentities, Pat explained:  \nIt’s a challenge, because there are these neat little boxes [in which we define \nourselves], and I don’t fit in any of them. So trying to find the right words to \ndescribe [myself] has been kind of a challenge sometimes. I guess it’s still \nsomething I’m coming to terms with. \n \n101 \nWhereas sexual orientation is a subject of less frequent confusion in society, many people \nare still mis-educated regarding gender expression. The burden of explaining the nuances \nof their identities is a source of frustration for Pat, both on personal and larger scales. \n“There’s like…do I really want to explain why I want these pronouns or what this means \nif this person doesn’t know?” they mused: \nOn the one hand, yes…I can tell you about my experience of this, but there are \nother experiences and I know you’re capable of using the internet…so I’m sure \nyou could also find information about it there. \n \nA specific challenge for Pat is explaining the amorphic nature of their identities. \nAlthough they categorize their gender identity as nonbinary or genderqueer, their sexual \nidentity is more fluid and nuanced, they explained:  \nI do aromantic and I also do asexual phases. Asexual is like when you’re not \ninterested in sex, period. Aromantic is when you’re not interested in romantic \nrelationships…for me, sometimes these phases are at the same time and \nsometimes they’re different. \n \nThese phases can last months or even years for Pat, and, contrary to common perception, \nare not necessarily related. Because of the fluid nature of their sexual and gender \nidentities, Pat is quick to point out that their queer identity might be very different from \nanother person’s. The sense of social responsibility that attends coming out – particularly \nas part of such a misunderstood community – is a crucial source of anxiety for Pat: “It’s \njust weird,” they explained, “that all of the responsibility of educating people has to fall \non one person. Like, you could know someone else and they have a completely different \nperspective on the whole thing.” \nLiving in a society in which gender roles and expectations are largely established \nand any deviations can be seen as threatening, Pat confesses that since leaving the \n102 \nrelative safety of their highly-educated, progressive undergraduate institution, they fear \npeople’s reactions should they learn of their identity. Already a naturally anxious person, \nthis fear around disclosure creates a self-imposed barrier toward interacting socially. \nIntroverted and shy, confrontation makes Pat uncomfortable: \nI don’t like making other people uncomfortable. I know a lot of the reason is \nbecause female-bodied people in our society are trained to be quiet and not \nimpose themselves upon others, so that’s part of it. I’ve always been a very shy \nperson aside of that, as well, so when someone else gets uncomfortable [for \ninstance, upon learning of their identities], it automatically makes me \nuncomfortable. So like if I’m uncomfortable with this [hiding their identity] but \nI’m more uncomfortable with them being made uncomfortable talking about it, I \nhave to weigh which is more uncomfortable for me. \n \nBecause of these challenges, Pat struggles to weigh the importance of disclosure against \ntheir need for authenticity among their peers and acquaintances. “One of the hardest parts \nfor me in building relationships of any kind,” they explain, “is figuring out where you can \nsettle with the person.” In every social interaction, Pat wonders how much a person needs \nto know about them:  \nI’m just not a social person. The reason I made so many friends in undergrad was \nbecause I had two friends and they had friends. If you have like two friends who \nknow you they introduce you in the way they know you, whereas when you meet \npeople individually you wonder if this is a person you will want to share all these \ndetails with.  \n \nThough their gender identity is an integral component of their larger identity, Pat finds it \nmuch more difficult at ASU to share this than at their undergraduate institution, where a \nlarge and diverse LGBTQ+ community meant that Pat’s gender identity did not require \nlengthy explanation. But being female-bodied, Pat is regularly misgendered now that they \nhave left that institution, placing them into the situation of either correcting others or \nletting the misgendering pass unnoticed: “Being misgendered is agitating to me. Society \n103 \nhas all these assumptions [based on gender], right…so they’re putting me in a box with \nall these other things instead of learning who I am.” These interactions are a near-\nconstant occurrence for Pat: \nI feel like generally, people don’t perceive my queerness on the level that I do. \nThey’re like ‘that’s a person with short hair’. No, they’re probably like ‘that’s a \ngirl with short hair’ and that’s like a thing…short hair no longer means you’re \ngay. So it’s not like super perceptible, so there’s been no need to put up facades. \nI’m not the kind of person who just walks into a room and everybody knows.  \n \nThe problem is that Pat wants people to know their gender identity and to properly \ngender them: “How would a guy like to be called a girl?”, they ask. While being \nmisgendered is frustrating and embarrassing, having to correct others’ assumptions are \nequally emotionally stressful: \nWith friends, it’s like ‘do they really need to know?’ Obviously it would be good \nif friends at least knew pronouns, but it’s really weird figuring out when the right \ntime to do that [disclose their gender identity] is…so [of] the friends I have [here], \nI don’t think I’ve come out to that many at all. And outwardly since I’m dating a \nguy they just think ‘average person’, so that’s…troublesome…but I don’t know \nhow to do it now, because it’s been [nearly] a year. \n \nWhile nondisclosure results in constant misgendering, Pat struggles to address the issue, \nand this is only exacerbated over time. “Sometimes I get anxious when I think about the \nfact that a big chunk of my friends here don’t know anything about me,” they explain: \nIt would be nice if everyone that I hung out with referred to me by the right \n[they/them] pronouns, but I don’t know how much they know. With people who \ndon’t know about my gender identity, I feel like I should say something, but I’m \nnot good at speaking up. \n \nThis inability to speak up, compounded by the frustration of misgendering, has \nhad a heavy toll on Pat’s ability to develop friendships. Although their reasons for doing \nso are not based on fear of discovery (as are those of Neil and Pea), Pat carefully \ncompartmentalizes their life: \n104 \nSo for me it’s kind of weird. I post about being queer in like [social media], so \npeople that I don’t know and will never meet know. But for people that I do \nknow, if they aren’t going to ask about it, I’m like ‘why should I bother with \ntelling them?’  \n \nPat has extreme difficulty making friends, and has constructed an elaborate construct in \nwhich only the closest of acquaintances learn about their identities: \nIt’s like when someone gets from third-tier friendship to second-tier friendship, \nI’m like ‘is this person going to get to first-tier friendship and am I going to have \nto reassess the relationship?’ and be like if I think someone is going to make it to \nfirst tier, I have to tell them this. Because I’m not going to have people in first tier \nwho don’t know this about me…Third tier is like acquaintances. Second tier is \nlike when you start to become friends, and first tier is the people you are close \nfriends with. \n \nOnly Pat’s closest acquaintances, the ‘first tier’ friends, are those they are comfortable \ndisclosing their identity to, though they openly acknowledge the irony that nondisclosure \nis a frequent barrier to friends ‘moving up’ the ladder of friendship.  \n Even when they had a greater sense of community as an undergraduate, Pat \nacknowledges that their identities were an ‘otherness,’ allowing them to remain aloof \nfrom peers. Recounting the story of the development of one friendship, Pat recalled: \n [They] are one of those humans who decides that they’re going to be your friend \nand then inserts themself into your life. So at first it is like ‘why is this weird \nperson stalking me?’ And then it’s like ‘oh, we have things in common.’ And they \nkeep pushing their way in and you’re like ‘oh, alright.’ Then we worked on a \nproject and it was like ‘okay, we have a lot in common’ and so by that point it \nwas like we have a lot in common, they’re a pretty cool person, and I’m gonna go \nahead and do this thing [and come out to them]. \n \nAt a fundamental level, Pat is somewhat suspicious of the intentions of others, and has \ndifficulty recognizing the value others place in relationships with them: “[They] are just a \nvery weird person who likes weird people.” Pat experiences such anxiety over disclosure \n105 \nthat they actively avoid telling others about their identities, even knowing doing so \nprecludes the possibility of closer friendships: \nBecause if they don’t care about my life, why should I bother, like, telling them \nthings? I mean, if I’m not going to interact with someone a lot, I’m not going to \ntell them, because it’s ultimately not going to affect either of us because we’re not \ngoing to see each other. \n \nNot having a community in which they feel comfortable disclosing their identities and \nbeing their authentic self has deeply impacted Pat’s sense of identity. Whereas during \ncollege, Pat had the social and cultural capital to navigate identity more seamlessly, their \nisolation at ASU has directly impacted not only their ability to process their identities, but \nhas resulted in a lack of confidence to do so: \nA little while back I saw someone crossing the street and they were wearing a t-\nshirt that said ‘hello! My pronouns are they/them’ and [I was like] ‘that is the kind \nof confidence I want to have.’ A lot of the struggle comes from how many people \nreally need to know this about me. I just want to be more comfortable. More \nauthentic…so I don’t have to worry about my pronouns. \n \nA major goal, they say, is simply to find a community “where it’s not weird to be queer.” \n \nIdentity, Nondisclosure, and Social Isolation: Neil’s Story \nOne of Neil’s greatest fears is that others will discover that he is gay and react \npoorly. While Pat yearned for connection to a larger LGBTQ+ community and is \nuncomfortable navigating cis- and heteronormative environments, Neil’s anxiety over \ndisclosure actively kept him from seeking connection to other gay men; not entirely \ncomfortable within a heteronormative environment, the prospect of navigating an \nLGBTQ+ one makes him equally uneasy. \nNeil only began coming out to peers while pursuing his doctoral degree. Fear of \nlosing friendships not only caused him to compartmentalize his social life, but led him to \n106 \nactively minimize the importance of his sexual identity. Maintaining a stark contrast \nbetween his sexual orientation and sexual expression, he eventually came to understand \nand accept his same-sex attraction but adamantly did not allow it to define him – a form \nof internalized homophobia common among gay men from cultures with clearly-defined \nconstructs of masculinity and femininity (Slootmaeckers & Lievens, 2014). With \norientation and expression at odds, his sexual identity was stunted. Shunning other gay \nmen in public, he cultivated an outwardly heteronormative life. Although he “still \nenjoyed hanging out with straight friends,” though, those relationships were constantly \novershadowed by fear of discovery: “I feared their reaction,” he explained, “because I \ndon’t know how they would react to me being gay. It’s kind of an uncertainty that brings \na fear.”  \nEven after coming to the US, Neil’s most salient identity has been his Chinese \nheritage, and the majority of his closest peers have been other male Chinese students. \nAlthough younger, more Westernized Chinese demographic groups – including the urban \nand highly educated – trend toward greater acceptance of LGBTQ+ identities (Cao, \nWang & Gao, 2010; Xie & Peng, 2018), Neil’s more traditional upbringing led him to \nautomatically kept others at arm’s length, assuming they would be homophobic and not \naccepting of his being gay. For this reason, he suppressed his LGBTQ+ identity. He \navoided meaningful interactions or relationships within the gay community, and was \noften dismissive of it. Because his knowledge of gay culture and society were limited to \nthese tentative forays, he developed a limited perspective of what it meant to be part of an \nLGBTQ+ community shaped largely by stereotype and what he saw portrayed in the \npopular media: \n107 \nOne thing I was very wary of is…[gay culture]. Drag [culture]…what is drag? \nWhy are people dressed as women? I don’t understand why they have to do this. \nAnd also in some chat groups [that he has visited], some [gay men] like to call \neach other like sister or something like that. That is something I [still] don’t quite \nunderstand. We’re gay men, but we’re still men…so why do we call each other \nsisters? It’s weird. I accept that, but I am not like that. That’s the way they like to \nbe. \n \nStill, he acknowledged that his lack of disclosure and disinterest in joining larger \nLGBTQ+ communities were challenges: \nIt’s really hard, right? You have no one to share [with]. You sometimes really feel \ndesperate. You feel so lonely, so it’s a lot of emotion to take…it’s really hard, but \nyou still have to go through that process. \n \nEven now, having become more comfortable not only engaging with a larger LGBTQ+ \ncommunity and coming out as gay to peers, he remains very selective in who he tells. “Of \nthe group I have told,” he explained,  \nI know them well.  I have known them for more than two years. So other junior \nlabmates that just came here less than one year ago, I don’t know them well, so I \ndon’t tell them. My identity is a very personal thing. Very personal to me…and I \nonly want to share my personal things to my close friends. \n \nIdentity, Nondisclosure, and Social Isolation: Pea’s Story \nPea’s LGBTQ+ identity and issues around disclosure have resulted in difficulties \nnavigating interpersonal relationships with straight peers for Pea as well, though to a \nlesser extent than for Pat and Neil.  \n Specifically, she is cautious initiating friendships with straight women – \nsomething she explicitly connects to both lingering discomfort in her LGBTQ+ identity \nand difficulties navigating her international identity. Not confident in her ability to pick \nup the subtle cues in body language, vocal cadence and interaction that often allow \nmembers of the LGBTQ+ community to recognize one another – something colloquially \n108 \nreferred to as ‘having gaydar’ – she has trouble determining whether peers might be part \nof the LGBTQ+ community. “I think my gaydar is broken,” she laughs. “In China it \nworked, but here it doesn’t work unless I see someone who looks like me, a tomboy”. \nBecause there’s no sexual attraction on her part, and therefore is no ambiguity to their \nrelationships, most of Pea’s friends are straight men. Uncertain of how to approach them \n(or how to tell if they might be attracted to her), she tends to be timid of other lesbians, \nand she fears inadvertently making straight women uncomfortable should they find out \nshe’s gay: \nI will still make friends with them [women], but it’s more effort than with guys \nfor sure. I usually feel awkward hanging out with straight girls because \nboundaries…it just makes things easier [to avoid female friends]. I feel like I’m \nmore cautious about it. \n \nA constant concern is that straight women will misconstrue her intentions and friendship. \nShe fears that if a female acquaintance finds out she is gay, they will interpret any \naffection she demonstrates as romantic or sexual attraction. “I think maybe girls are prone \nto that,” she says: \nI feel like it. And body-language-wise, because Asian culture is more about \ntouching, and I grew up in a culture where I am comfortable doing that, I find \nmyself refraining from doing that [platonic physical contact] with girls. But with \nguys who know my sexuality it isn’t a problem. \n \nPea also worries both about developing physical or romantic attractions to straight female \nfriends or running the risk of straight women questioning her intent in befriending them. \n“With straight women, it will be like…I need to keep my emotions in check, that type of \nthing,” she says. “If the straight girl has a partner, a boyfriend, I will be more self-\nconscious when I’m with them both, trying to keep my distance [out of perceived \nrespect].” \n109 \n Just as it is for Pat, Pea’s sexual identity and her fear of making others \nuncomfortable has been a challenge. Whereas Neil trades on a heteroconforming \nappearance as ‘just one of the guys’ and passes as straight, Pea – with her short, \ntraditionally masculine hairstyle and gender presentation – feels her sexuality is much \nmore visible. Her self-described tomboy look provides Pea cultural currency in \nidentifying and being identified by other lesbians, a form of visual shorthand in coming \nout: if she sees another girl who looks similar to her, she feels they are more likely to be \ngay and she, in turn, feels more comfortable being around them: “I think the easiest is for \nsome lesbian girl to look like me,” she says. While her identity expression provides social \ncurrency among other lesbians, though, it’s something she is not entirely comfortable \nwith in other situations: \n[it’s] been something that’s been bothering me for a while. I guess I’m just not \ncomfortable with physical appearance [and identity expression]. I get mistaken for \na boy or a man too often, and that is getting really uncomfortable. People who \nlook like this should be a man, not a girl. That’s something…that’s a barrier. I feel \ndifferent. That’s, uh…hard. And then when people mistake me for a man, I have a \ntendency to apologize for it. I don’t know what the hell’s wrong with me that I \nfeel like I need to apologize. I feel like I shouldn’t [fear potentially making others \nuncomfortable], maybe that’s something I can prevent from happening. \n \nWhile she embraces both her sexual orientation and expression, it makes her self-\nconscious in more heteronormative environments.  \nSo the prime example is sometimes when I go through an airport, through TSA, \nsometimes a guy will just start patting on me…that’s just not comfortable. And \nthen there’s just…just like when I went to the gym [for the first time], trying to \nget a locker, and a girl [at the service desk] was like ‘there’s the men’s locker \nroom [over there], just find a place. That’s just so very awkward, I have to tell her \nstuff and then she gets uncomfortable and I get uncomfortable as well. Somehow I \nfeel sorry but I shouldn’t feel sorry about it.  \n \n110 \nShe is uncomfortable in certain physical environments, and finds herself avoiding spaces \nwhere she feels her sexuality might not be as tolerated – even if these are spaces that are \nimportant to her. For instance, although she is an avid basketball players, the student \nrecreation center – and specifically the locker room – is a distinctly uncomfortable place:  \nMy mindset is I will still worry about what people will think. I feel awkward \nsometimes, mostly, like you know with interactions with people. For example, \nwhen I go to the gym I go to the locker room and I feel a little uncomfortable \nmaking eye contact and stuff so I just look down [and don’t engage with others]. \n \nWhen these are spaces that might otherwise affirm commonality (in this case, a physical \nrecreation space), Pea’s awareness of her own perceived difference limits her potential \nfor interaction. \nPost-mentorship: Role Modeling and Community Connection  \n \n Over the four-month data collection period, all three research study participants \nexpressed greater interest in connecting with an LGBTQ+ community as a direct result of \ntheir mentoring relationships, though they demonstrated varying degrees of actual \ncommunity connection. Another significant emergent theme was a growing sense of civic \nresponsibility to the LGBTQ+ community or need to ‘pay it forward’. Two participants \n(Neil and Pea) cited their mentoring relationships as instrumental in kindling this interest, \ncrediting their mentors as strong role models whose visibility and compassion for other \nmembers of the LGBTQ+ community inspired them to become stronger advocates for \ntheir own community. Only one (Pat) did not demonstrate an increased sense of \ndisclosure, visibility or advocacy as a responsibility toward the LGBTQ+ community. \n \n \n111 \nRole Modeling and Community Connection: Pat’s Story \nHaving worked with their mentor for the shortest period of time, Pat demonstrated \nthe least positive correlation between mentorship and community engagement. However, \nthe challenges Pat faced in community entry – primarily a perceived lack of opportunity \nand a generalized social anxiety – were unique barriers not expressly cited by Neil or Pea. \n For Pat, LGBTQ+ community engagement is a significant key not only in \nnavigating their ongoing identity development, but in finding a sense of community \nbelonging while at ASU. The extreme anxiety they experience in cis- and \nheteronormative environments makes finding an LGBTQ+ community important to Pat \nas a safe space in which they do not have to worry about being confronted around their \nidentities. “I like to have a lot of varied queer type friends,” they say: \nIt’s just easier to relate to someone who has a similar experience as a baseline. It’s \nalways really nice, like, to realize I can walk into a room and not worry about \nhaving to tell people this thing about myself because they’re all going to relate in \nsome way or another, even if they’re a different queer identity than me. \n \nCommunity is about more than just that safe space or commonality, though. As they \ncontinue discovering their identities, Pat craves the learning opportunities the diversity of \nLGBTQ+ communities represent: it gives them “the opportunity to say ‘this is what it’s \nlike to be queer to me. What’s it like to be queer to you?’” they explain. Especially as Pat \ncontinues navigating both gender and sexual identities and the ways they intersect with \nand complicate one another, they crave the experience and perspectives of other \nLGBTQ+ peers as they figure out how these pieces of identity fit together. Pat’s current \nsocial network is largely limited to a small group of cisgender, heterosexual males from \ntheir former academic department – friends of their partner, who is still in that program. \n112 \nWithin this group, Pat doesn’t feel comfortable having conversations around identity, and \nin fact has not come out to them. Finding a stronger queer community would give them \nthe opportunity “to learn about how other things – other identity pieces – affect other \npeople I might not otherwise get a chance to learn.” \nExposure to the multitude of queer identities helps Pat reaffirm their own \nidentities and provides a grounding experience, as the recent shift required in their own \nmindset in entering a relationship with a heterosexual, cisgender male has caused a \ndegree of identity shift and uncertainty for them. Queer community also provides an \nemotional balm of sorts to Pat, who feels the validity of their identities is constantly \nunder question in the largely cis- and heteronormative world Pat currently inhabits. \nReflecting on the solace their former LGBTQ+ community provided during college, they \nnote: \nThere are so many things and it’s easier to just be queer rather than figuring out \nwhich sexuality or which gender you have to identify with, so everyone’s just \nqueer. I’m this in-between [person] and that’s just great, so it [the need for \nLGBTQ+ community] is a very real thing. \n \nPat’s mentor, who is extensively involved in the local LGBTQ+ community, has played \nan integral role in Pat’s gradual reentry into an LGBTQ+ community. “It’s really cool to \nhave a link on campus,” they say. “Like, I didn’t know any queer people [here] before.” \nWith their mentor’s own network of gender-queer friends and contacts in the university \nand general communities, Pat is optimistic they might find the support and affinity they \nare looking for. “It’s nice to know there are more of us out there,” they say.  \nAlthough Pat acknowledges they have not taken their mentor up on as many \nopportunities to socialize in the community as they feel they should, this is partly due to \n113 \nPat’s hectic courseload and schedule during the past semester: in addition to taking a \ncredit overload in an attempt to complete their degree within the next year, they are \nworking full-time, and time is increasingly a rare commodity. Despite these challenges, \nthough, Pat is optimistic about the rekindling of their re-connection to the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity, and has attended both community events (slam poetry readings) and political \nactivities (LGBTQ+ rights rallies at the State Capitol, campaigning for the Arizona \nDemocrats prior to the 2018 midterm elections). Pat has always found advocacy and \nvolunteerism important, but since leaving her previous community, has not participated \nin community initiatives. “Volunteering is something I’d like to do more,” they say, “but \nsomething I have a hard time getting involved in. Usually it’s because I don’t have \nanybody to go with…I don’t like going places alone.” Pat’s mentor has gently pushed \nthem to become more engaged locally and on campus, pointing out events they might be \ninterested in and including Pat in their own plans. “Every week,” Pat notes, “she’s like \n‘hey, this thing is happening. Do you want to go?’” Building a stronger queer network is \nan ongoing goal of Pat’s involvement in HUES, and they’ve attended several LGBTQ+ \ncommunity workshops over the course of the semester, both alone and with their mentor, \nin the hopes of forming the network connections they need to take a more active role in \ntheir community. \nRole Modeling and Community Connection: Neil’s Story \nNeil’s primary motivation in joining a mentoring program was to find a sense of \ncommunity connection with other LGBTQ+ individuals.  “I always feel I am alone in this \ncommunity,” he says. Naturally an introvert, socializing has always been difficult. “I’ve \njust never liked to meet or know other people,” he noted. Beyond that, though, his \n114 \nreticence was rooted in insecurity. “I would say I didn’t have the courage. Partly because \nI didn’t have the time, but also because I didn’t have the courage to meet other gay \npeople and make those connections.” Dedicating himself to his studies was a means of \ncompartmentalizing his identities; by focusing singularly on his research, he rationalized \nhis lack of initiative in developing relationships within the LGBTQ+ community as  “not \nhaving the time”. As he has slowly come out to peers and become more comfortable in \nhis identity, though, Neil has acknowledged that it’s time to invest more in his own \ninterpersonal development: \nI think when we get more mature and get more knowledge you get that moment \nwhere you want to know really who you are and what’s going on. I think before I \ntried to stay away from this, from thinking about these things. Now I think is the \ntime to really think about it and address this. One of the things is just getting into \nthe community and knowing more people like me. I also want my own happiness. \nI want a soulmate I can live or share my life with. \n \nOnce afraid to explore his sexuality, his experiences with his mentor – as well as the \npositive reactions he’s had from the few peers he has come out to – has shifted his \nperspective. Before, he said: \nYou have a lot of concerns, right? About what others, what your family think \nabout you, right? You have pressures from others thinking about you…now I \nwant to start from inside. I don’t care what others think; I want my own \nhappiness. I want to care for myself, to love for myself. \n \nOf the three research participants, Neil had the most difficulty accepting his sexuality, \nwith his cultural upbringing a major factor in his reluctance to embrace or actively \nexplore it. Feeling he was an “outsider, so different from others” and having nobody to \nprocess his developing identity with was incredibly isolating, leaving Neil feeling \nalienated from his peers. He exhibited signs of generalized homophobia and \nhomonegativity, characterizing other gay men as “feminine” and “weird,” and was \n115 \nadamant in appropriating heteronormative values. Even after joining the HUES \nmentoring program, he questioned the need for LGBTQ+ specific communities. “The \nonly difference is the gender that we love,” he said. “Everything else can be pretty much \nthe same, right? We have the same achievements and goals.” \nHis time in HUES has shifted his perspective, though. Once reluctant to seek \nLGBTQ+ community membership, Neil now recognizes that his emotional fulfillment in \nlife depends on his embracing his LGBTQ+ identity and engaging more proactively with \nhis community. He yearns for a greater connection than the ephemeral, superficial \nrelationships fostered through social media and dating apps that were his only connection \nto other LGBTQ+ men for a long time. “They sometimes led to meaningful connections,” \nhe now notes of the online forums, chatrooms, and dating apps he once used, “but mostly \nnot.” \nWorking with his mentor and attending LGBTQ+ community events, including \nHUES programming, has given Neil a greater appreciation for and affinity with this \ncommunity. Reflecting on his earlier reticence to interact with other gay men, he admits \nhis reluctance was based on fear and preconceptions. “I think most people,” he says, “are \nnot accepting of this [community] or are fearful because they have very little knowledge \nabout it.” He speaks of the stereotypes he once held of other gay men, shaped largely by \npopular culture: “I think some people have certain stereotypes about gay people, think \nthey are sassy or feminine or something like that.” Working with his mentor has allowed \nNeil to redefine and normalize the gay experience. Outside their weekly meetings and \ncheck-ins, Neil has even socialized with his mentor, meeting his mentor’s partner and \nfriends. Interacting with a broader gay community, he says, has been educational: \n116 \nIt turns out that my ideas were not right, we are also a very diverse group of \npeople. So if you learn more about this community, you realize they are not \nabnormal. Then you feel more receptive to these types of things…you can get to \nknow more about this community, get to know these people so you feel you know \nthem more, they are not foreign to you. And then naturally you are more willing \nto go there. They’re not monsters, right? They’re just like you. \n \nRealizing that other gay men are no different than him has not only bolstered Neil’s \naffinity to the community, but made him more comfortable with his own identity. “I feel \nmore used to it as I see it more,” he says. “Like ‘hmmm…[that’s] not a big deal.” As he \ngains affinity in his identity as a gay male, he finds navigating disclosure to be less a \nchallenge and is more open with his peers: \nAfter I came out to some labmates, my friends told me that almost all of my \nlabmates know I’m gay now. They do not treat me any differently, so I think \nthat’s encouraging to me. If they ask me, I tell them…I just tell them.  \n \nLiberated by this revelation, he isn’t anxious over the potential reaction of peers or \ncolleagues to his disclosure. If others are hostile or uncomfortable, he says, he now \nshrugs it off, knowing he has the support of his larger peer group. “I think the best way to \ndeal with those things [negative statements or homophobic peers or colleagues] is \nactually to ignore them,” he says. “Do you care about those unrelated people’s words to \nyou? You should only care about those who are close to you.” \nOnce having viewed larger LGBTQ+ culture as largely irrelevant to his identity \nand life’s goals, Neil is now eager to explore it further: \nIt’s like you find a new continent or something like that. It’s like you find a new \narea, something you’ve never known before. It’s a weird feeling, right? It’s not \nfrustrating [anymore]…it’s like you want to dig more. You want to know more, \nand talk to more people. So…it’s exciting! \n \nAlthough his classmates and labmates remain his primary peer group and source of \npsychosocial support, his perspectives have shifted, allowing his sexual identity to \n117 \nbecome more salient as he becomes more embedded in the LGBTQ+ community. “I still \nfeel like my professional identity is more central than my gay identity,” he explains, but \n“going forward, I think I should tell my colleagues that I am gay.” He identifies this as a \nsignificant turning point, and looks forward to an academic and professional life that \nbetter integrates his personal identity. \nAt the same time, Neil increasingly finds himself reliant upon his LGBTQ+ peers, \nnot his straight ones, for guidance and support. As he begins to explore dating and further \nconnection with the LGBTQ+ community, Neil notes that even though his heterosexual \npeers are supportive, “you don’t always know if it’s the right topic to talk to them about. \nEven now that I have come out to them, sometimes [I] still feel weird to tell them about \nthese things.” Mentorship has provided him not only the additional resources he needs, \nbut helped him recognize the importance of peers that share LGBTQ+ social and cultural \nperspectives. \nAs he prepares to finish his degree, Neil looks forward to further developing his \nLGBTQ+ community. He has accepted a job offer that will take him to the extremely \nLGBTQ+ friendly San Francisco area upon graduation. San Francisco’s liberal, gay-\nfriendly reputation was a primary reason he accepted this offer over others, noting “a \nspecific category [I] want to engage in now is a gay community.”  \nBeyond providing Neil with support in developing his identity, mentorship has \nbeen a source of inspiration. “He and his boyfriend really share their life,” he says of his \nmentor. “That’s really an example for me…that it could also happen for me, right, and \nthat someday I could also have that sort of life.” For a long time, Neil feared his personal \nvalues and goals (importance of family, a long-term relationship and career success) were \n118 \nat odds with what he saw within the LGBTQ+ community. Long-term, caring \nrelationships and “meaningful connections” were something Neil craved, but not seeing \nhealthy examples of these among the limited LGBTQ+ networks he’d known, he feared \nthe value he placed on these relationships put him at odds within the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. “Before then,” he notes, “I did not have any gay friends who maintained \nlong true relationships. You know [it seems] most people in the community have very \nshort relationships” or one-off sexual encounters, and “that’s something I don’t like.” \nSeeing his mentor’s interactions with his own partner, though, gives Neil hope: “I see \ntheir interactions and they are a very sweet, nice couple.” Interacting with them, he says, \n“you feel someday you will also be like that. They influence me because they can have a \nvery long-term relationship and [I] feel like I can also do that.” This makes him “feel \nhopeful.” \nThis normalization of gay relationships helped break down barriers to community \nentry for Neil. Whereas Neil previously maintained clear separations between his \nLGBTQ+ identity and other elements of his life, he envisions a future in which they are \nmerged. Asked what upcoming goals or milestones might be next, he declared:  \nOf course getting married, having kids. And two families together and [we] get to \nknow eachothers’ families…and almost all the people around you – or all the \npeople in the world! – know that you are gay! \n \nCurrently still timid about holding hands or displaying affection in public, Neil notes that \nhis reservations in doing so – safety, primarily – are overridden by a need to be visible: \n“going forward, one day I want to do that in public, like you can show love to your \npartner in front of everyone else.” Asked what he needs to do to get to that point, Neil \n119 \nbecomes contemplative: “I think it’s how do we get there, right? It’s not about you, you \nalso need to raise awareness of other people.” \nThe sense of LGBTQ+ community connection has made a rich impact for Neil. \nConversations with his mentor and a slowly growing LGBTQ+ network has made him \nrealize that “the process gets better.” Although he does not view himself ready to be a \nvisible role model to other members of the LGBTQ+ community yet, he recognizes the \nimportance of doing so – eventually: “maybe in the future,” he says, once he feels he has \nmore to offer. “Like Tim Cook [Apple CEO],” he explains: \nWhy did he decide to come out now? I think maybe earlier he was more [private], \nright, very protective of his personal things. Now, he thinks as the CEO of a big \ntech company he has more responsibility to act as an examples to others, right? I \nthink that’s a push for him. Right now, I don’t have that big push for me. \n \nHis recent experiences – beginning a relationship and attending diversity and inclusion \nworkshops and programming with his mentor – have caused him to start considering \nwhat that future might look like: “more broadly now,” he says, “I think about equality. In \ngeneral…marriage equality, racial equality. I’ve [been] inspired by things like that.” And \nalthough he isn’t ready to take on advocacy and larger-scale LGBTQ+ community issues \nyet, Neil wants to help peers facing the struggles and challenges he has navigated in \ncoming to terms with his own identity. “Going forward,” he explains, “if someone has \ngone through a similar experience as me or needs my experience or guidance, I am more \nwilling to guide him or her.” Providing that type of support or mentorship “is really \nimportant,” he says, and he would advise any peers struggling with identity issues to seek \nmentorship: “there’s a huge group out there that you should connect with,” he says. \n“You’re an outlier, but if you’re more involved, you’ll struggle less.”  \n120 \nMentorship, Role Modeling and Community Connection: Pea’s Story \nPrior to her time in the HUES program, it did not occur to Pea to seek out larger \nLGBTQ+ groups or campus organizations. Though she was part of multiple communities \nat her previous institution – a small Chinese student community, the cohort of her \nacademic program – her only LGBTQ+ community membership was one cohort member \nand other “lesbian friends she’s found now and then.” Because her last institution was in \na small private college town “and there weren’t a lot of things to do” outside the \nuniversity, it had never occurred to her that “there are communities like this.” Navigating \nher identity on her own and compartmentalizing her LGBTQ+ identity from the rest of \nher social life has “also been a habit,” she says: “I’ve always been alone.” \n Pea has found the greatest degree of support in her identity from peers and her \nlarger community of the research study participants, both previous to and during her time \nat ASU. Early positive interactions were elemental to her sense of identity comfort: “I \nwas driving down here with my ex-girlfriend from Pennsylvania. My advisor texted me \nand said ‘are you free? Let’s go for drinks, let me introduce you to the lab.’” Not wanting \nto leave her then-girlfriend alone and encouraged by the sense of comraderie within the \nprogram she saw when first interviewing to the program, Pea decided to disclose her \nrelationship to her advisor. “I never told any of my advisors or people I worked with \nbefore,” she explained. “I contemplated a lot…and my advisor always projected to me as \nbeing a very open person. So I texted and said ‘my girlfriend is with me…can she \ncome?’” When her advisor answered in the affirmative, Pea “was so happy that day! I \nwas a little nervous, but she was cool with it, her husband was cool with it, and other \npeople in the lab…it has definitely made a difference.” \n121 \n Since beginning to come out, Pea has found both acceptance and support \nacademically and socially, and this has cemented her affinity to her academic program. \nCurrently single, her peers have helped her navigate a dating life. At her previous \ninstitution, upon coming out to friends in her department, she recalls: \nI wanted to date this American girl…and that was difficult. I mean, because I \ndon’t know what to expect, I don’t know the rules [of American dating culture]. \nSo I’ve been asking them, and they’ve been giving me tips…it’s funny.  \n \nNot only did her peers take her coming out in stride, but actively encouraged her to \npursue the relationship: \nThey even tried to set me up with [the girl]. We went out to a bar and she is \nworking in the same office but a different department. The really close friends in \nthe office came, and the girl came. Then people started dancing and this [other] \ngirl grabbed my hand and put it on her hip and we started dancing. Subtle, it was \nreally subtle, but it’s funny.  \n \n Like Neil, Pea’s social network has always been primarily straight but inclusive, \nand she was somewhat hesitant to engage with a larger LGBTQ+ community upon her \nentrance into HUES. “I’ll be frank with you,” she said: “I am a timid person, so I tend not \nto be in the circle.” Having few LGBTQ+ friends and navigating the challenges inherent \nin coming from a more traditional, reserved Chinese culture, she was intimidated by what \nshe saw of LGBTQ+ culture: “the people from the community that I have seen are the \nreally extroverted ones…their lifestyles are not the lifestyle I would want to live.” With \nher outsider perspective, she felt that her perception of the LGBTQ+ culture “was more \nwhat a straight person would see the LGBTQ+ community as being.” Specifically, she \nsaw the partygoers. “I was like ‘where did all the quiet gays go?’” she laughed. “Because \nI thought every gay or lesbian was like that I thought ‘oh man, I don’t want to live my life \nthat way.’” \n122 \n Mentorship has allowed Pea to see another dynamic of the LGBTQ+ community, \nsomething she recognizes as making “a lot of good impact on my life.” The first time she \nmet with her mentor, she says, “he was like ‘you need to go and socialize.’” With his \nencouragement, she began exploring opportunities within the LGBTQ+ community, \nfinding an LGBTQ+ Toastmaster club in the heart of the city’s LGBTQ+ neighborhood. \n“So I went there,” she said, “and it’s been amazing.” Meeting LGBTQ+ people whose \ninterests were more aligned with her own challenged the preconceptions and limitations \nshe, like Neil, had assumed came with being part of an LGBTQ+ community. \n“Everybody’s super friendly…and responsible,” she noted. “They have initiatives and \ntheir own stuff. They’re all family-oriented…that just attests to my [own] values.”  \nThrough the lens of this community, Pea has gained a new perspective on what it means \nto be gay: \nMy mentor there, she’s a lesbian and has a son who is twenty-one years now, and \nthat is just a great example…there are gay men, a pair of them just got married. I \ndon’t know a lot of gay people, honestly, so it’s great seeing who they are and that \nthey can be really confident being gays and lesbians. And they can be achieved, \nquite a bit…that’s amazing.  \n \nFor the first time, Pea no longer feels like an outsider among her fellow LGBTQ+ peers. \n“It makes things a lot easier, it shows that being gay and out is doable, and that feels \nexcellent. It helped me visualize a life,” she noted. “So it’s got me feeling really hopeful. \nExcited.” \nPea now considers a future she previously hadn’t contemplated, normalizing what \nhad previously been an isolating identity experience. Specifically, she realizes she \ndoesn’t have to forsake tradition values, such as family. “She’s happy,” she says of her \nToastmasters mentor: \n123 \nHer relationship with her wife is great, it’s healthy. And her relationship with her \nson…she talks about him all the time, she seems…normal. And that is pretty cool. \nNow I know what I saw [before] is not what I want, but I also know that what I \nsaw [before] is not what the community is. \n \nMentorship has also provided a feeling of familial support that Pea has not experienced \nsince leaving China, and that hiding her identity keeps her from experiencing with her \nown parents: “It’s something I haven’t quite had since I moved here. I feel like that \nwould be exaggerating, but I feel like I have a family here.” This makes her “a lot \nhappier, definitely more content.”  \n The sense of community affinity Pea has developed through her mentorship helps \nher better understand her own need for connection within this community as she \ncontinues navigating interpersonal relationships in the context of her sexual identity. “It’s \neasier now,” she says of navigating interpersonal relationships. Whereas she’s always \nbeen cautious in befriending straight women, the anxiety and challenges she felt in those \nrelationships vanishes among LGBTQ+ peers: “it’s easier to navigate a relationship with \na lesbian woman because there’s more to talk about,” she says, “and we have the same \nperspective.” As she finds commonality among her LGBTQ+ community, “I feel more \nconnected to it,” she explains, and she wants to be more involved.  \nThe encouragement and role modeling she has seen in her mentors has shifted her \nperspective on coming out to her family, too. “I want to take steps toward coming out \nnow,” she said during her last interview. Seeing the relationships her mentors have with \ntheir families has both empowered her and helped her realize the distance her \nnondisclosure has resulted in with her own family. Once concerned that coming out \nwould create barriers between herself and her family, Pea recognizes that disclosure \n124 \ncould actually result in a stronger relationship with her family. Learning how her mentor \nand other members of her new support community navigated disclosure and relationships \nwith their families has provided a new, more empathetic perspective for Pea. “One thing \nthat I realized,” she said, “was that my parents are actually helpless in this process.” A \nsignificant concern in coming out, she explained, was that her parents would worry about \nher wellbeing and future; now, she realizes that the best way to minimize that concern is \nto allow them to see the life she has and continues to build for herself. “I don’t know \nwhat’s the best way to do it,” she said, “but I think it’s to just start opening up to my \nparents more, not so much on my identity yet, but more on every other aspect of my life \nso they’re engaged.” Because she has kept so much from them – acknowledging that she \ndoesn’t share when she is struggling, although they can often tell something is bothering \nher – she hopes that rekindling a relationship and being open and honest about all \nelements of her life means that when she does come out, they will be able to see that she \nis thriving, that “they know I’ll be fine and that sort of stuff.” Although Pea attributed her \nearlier reluctance to disclose her identity as means of protecting her family, she now \nthinks differently:  \nI [was] more self-ish-thinking. I’ve been caring about myself most of the time, \nand me coming out apparently in my culture isn’t only about me, it’s about them \nand how they handle it, so I need to shift that [her reasons for remaining in the \ncloset], I feel like. \n \n“I had an ‘a-ha’ moment,” she continues. “I should make my mom and dad feel more \nsafe” by making a conscious effort to include them more in her life. Whereas previously \nshe deferred coming out because she wasn’t ready to face her parents’ potential \n125 \ndisappointment, now she sees coming out as a responsibility to her family: “I can’t \nremember the exact moment,” she reflects.  \nMaybe there’s something in my subconscious that when we talk about it in these \ninterviews and when I talk to my mentors about it, it all sort of comes together. It \nfeels like it’s getting to be time. And I think that I realized they need me. Over the \nsummer my grandma passed away and I saw my mother just break down, and that \nalso sort of made me realize family…and I haven’t given too much thought to that \nbefore. I’m constantly reflecting on the value of family now.  \n \nIn allowing her to reconcile her need for authenticity and her sense of filial piety, \nmentorship has provided Pea with a newfound ability to bridge the intersections of her \nChinese and LGBTQ+ identities. \n \nAs she completes her first year working with her mentor, Pea is grateful for the \nimpact mentorship has had not only in entering her new LGBTQ+ community, but in \ninspiring her to reconnect with her family, merging old and new identities and values she \nhad previously considered incompatible with one another:  \nI have nothing but positive experiences with all my mentors. They’ve been a \nhuge…they make me more affirming about my values. It’s such a great thing to \ncare about people, the genuine care I get from them. \n \nPreviously hesitant to integrate her academic and personal lives, she now embraces the \nchallenges of navigating the intersections of her identities: “I want to be more fearless. I \nrealize I don’t have to make the effort to merge them anymore.” Reflecting on her \nshifting perspectives, and her general happiness, she is optimistic: “I’ve made some \nprogress, maybe more than halfway, but not quite fully comfortable yet? I would say \nmore than halfway.”  Whereas previously, Pea feared coming out to others, now that fear \nhas receded, although she remains shy: \n126 \nWith strangers I am still not really comfortable showing who I am, but I am more \ncomfortable walking into the restroom or lockerroom [for instance] now. And in \nother aspects, if I want to approach [someone] because I like them or think we \ncould be friends, I’m still not very comfortable reaching out.  \n \nShe’s still learning, though, and is gaining confidence.  \n \nMore significantly, though, her mentoring experience has inspired her to want to \nhelp others navigate their own journeys. As a community outsider, she found inspiration \nin her mentors and the community members she met, and “that’s something I want to be,” \nshe says: “if anything, it makes me want to be an even better person being a lesbian.” \nWhile Pea once considered disclosure a personal decision, she now recognizes the need \nfor greater visibility within the LGBTQ+ community. Disclosure and visibility are \nimportant in a greater community context, she notes:  \nI feel like if I introduce herself as gay, it will help others. If they’re also having an \nissue with their identity, not necessarily being LGBTQ+, but any aspect…if \nsomeone has a difficulty accepting any part of their own identity, whatever that is, \nI will say things like that [coming out to them] to establish trust.  \n \nIn her own interpersonal relationships, Pea now views disclosure and authenticity as \nimportant and necessary to creating stronger friendships. “I feel like if I’m telling them, \nit’s not yet a small thing [to come out]. It’s still a big deal to a lot of the people I interact \nwith.” In trusting others with this detail of her personal life, she says, she is more \ntrustworthy. Trusting others and coming out has become easier, too: “I don’t feel like I’m \nhiding it subconsciously anymore,” she explains. “It’ll be whatever comes, it comes…it \nfeels more natural to me now. I still feel a little bit nervous before I decide to tell them, \nbut its better.” \n Like Neil, she also wants to become more involved in the larger LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. Many of the new connections she has met through her LGBTQ+ \n127 \nToastmasters group, for instance, are involved in community advocacy, advocacy, and \nsocial outreach. Although she hasn’t had the chance to do so yet, she says “that’s the next \nstep for me. I want to get involved.” Reflecting on her overall journey, she notes “Man, \nI’ve come a long way!” \nPost-mentorship: Resilience and Institutional Engagement \n For all three research participants, mentorship has resulted in increased resilience. \nFor Pat, resilience has been increased in the navigation of their interpersonal \nrelationships. In the cases of Neil and Pea, though, that resilience has manifested in not \nonly greater affinity to and navigation of their LGBTQ+ communities, but increased \nconnection to their academic communities as well.  \nResilience and Institutional Engagement: Pat’s Story \nFor Pat, the semester they have spent working with their mentor has been the \nmost useful, so far, in finding the tools to reflect upon and internally navigate the \ncomplexity of their own identities. “We’re figuring out identity stuff, so it’s been really \nuseful finding where you don’t need words to describe things about you…figuring things \nout. It’s certainly helped me be more comfortable with myself,” they observed at the end \nof the semester.  “Having those discussions, processing identity, has helped me express \nthings I haven’t known how to express before.”  \nBeing paired with a mentor who not only identifies as genderqueer and sexually \nfluid, but also studies human sexuality and gender, has provided Pat with the \nphilosophical and theoretical grounding to explain how they experience gender and \nsexuality. “She has a lot more experience with more knowledgy stuff about it,” they \nexplain. In the past, Pat and their peers explored gender and sexuality experientially from \n128 \ntheir own perspectives. “It’s interesting seeing it from both perspectives,” they say. \nHaving been in relationships with nonbinary and genderqueer individuals, Pat’s mentor \nbrings a nuanced approach to identity, blending the academic and the experiential. For \nPat, the level of understanding their mentor brings to their conversations is refreshing: \n“it’s a bit exciting,” they say, “and a relief.” \n Although only working with their mentor for a short period, Pat has made \nheadway in reconciling their identities. “Something I was talking about with my mentor \nis that her partner [who identifies as genderqueer, neither male nor female],” they said in \ntheir final interview. “Whenever they [their mentor’s partner] were touched in certain \nways, it would make them feel like they were being forcibly gendered,” they noted, \nexplaining that to a nonbinary person, whose identity is predicated specifically not \nidentifying with either male nor female genders, such physical reminders of gender can \nconstitute an imposed identity threat. Long unsure of how to process their frequent \nasexual and aromantic phases, Pat says: “I’d never thought about it before, but it made a \nlot of sense. As of now I’m just a person who doesn’t like to be touched.” Digging more \ndeeply into the connection between their discomfort with physical intimate touch and \ntheir gender identity, they explain, “would really change the dynamic of things” and \nhelps them navigate their current relationship, where physical intimacy is often a \nchallenge. \nPat has already implemented some of the strategies from their mentoring sessions. \nThey feel their relationship with their partner, now approaching its first full year, is \nfinally advancing. Although Pat believes their partner still doesn’t understand their \n129 \nidentity very much, they better understand their partner’s heteronormative, cisgender \nperspectives thanks to feedback from their mentor: “She [Pat’s mentor] is a lot like my \npartner in some ways, and I’m a lot like her partner in some ways,” they laughed, “so it’s \nlike getting some perspective on things her partner and I do from the perspective of the \nother partner.” Aside from normalizing their experience, tactics they and their mentor \nhave discussed have aided communication between Pat and their partner. At the very \nleast, Pat says, they can better understand and appreciate their partner’s perspectives on \nthe relationship, gender and sexuality.  \n This has allowed Pat to recognize their own newfound resilience: “all the back \nand forth” in processing identity and communication strategies has been a significant \ngrowth opportunity. Their identities, a source of frustration at times in the relationship, is \nnow something Pat views as an asset of their individuality: “the bounceback from being \nstraight-up gay for the past four years to someone who is the opposite now,” has made \nPat more appreciative of the diversity of the human experience.  \nLearning to be comfortable with change has been a breakthrough for Pat in other \nspheres of life as well. While long-term planning and the ambiguity of the future have \nbeen a source of extreme anxiety for Pat in the past, they are slowly learning to embrace \nchange. “Just the idea that I don’t have to be one thing forever,” they say, is empowering.  \n“It’s like people always expect you to pick a thing and that’s the thing you’re going to be \nfor the rest of your life,” they explain. “You do that with your identity, your career…it’s \nlike knowing there’s things you can change, you don’t have to be this forever, is really \n130 \ncool.” Embracing and better understanding the intersections of their identities has been \nliberating to them: “I don’t have to be whatever boxes I was in the past…I don’t have to \nbe them now, and I don’t have to be them in the future.”  \nResilience and Institutional Engagement: Neil’s Story \nOf the three interview participants, Neil has demonstrated the greatest degree of \ngrowth in terms of overall identity development and LGBTQ+ community engagement. \nThough initially an undeveloped LGBTQ+ identity, the three semesters he has worked \nwith his mentor have allowed the two to form a strong connection. He has learned “to \naccept [his] identity from within,” noting:  \nYou start with yourself. And then kind of gradually you will care less or not feel \nthat much about what others’ reactions will be. And if they don’t like you, then let \nit be. I’m more toward that kind of attitude right now. \n \nOf the time spent with his mentor, he explains: “you are influenced or impacted without \nknowing it. We didn’t have any specific goals every time we met after the first semester, \nbut we just chat very casually.” Neil spends a fair amount of time with his mentor outside \ntheir regular mentoring sessions, joining his mentor and his mentor’s partner socially and \nfor community events or activities, and these opportunities to learn more about the larger \nLGBTQ+ community were impactful: “Seeing his interactions with his gay friends and \nhis partner influenced me in an implicit way,” he noted.  \nAlthough at the time he reconciled his disinterest in building an LGBTQ+ support \ncommunity as a matter of time or lack of commonality, Neil now acknowledges that it \nwas fear of discovery – informed by his own cultural influences – that kept him from \napproaching others. He “didn’t want others to find out that I’m a gay, that I’m different \nfrom them,” he reflected. Through mentorship, he has realized that being gay doesn’t \n131 \nrepresent a conflict with his other identities or values, and he feels much more \ncourageous. Seeing role models with strong LGBTQ+ community values, such as his \nmentor and mentor’s partner, have validated his identity. “You should not pay too much \nattention to how others think about you,” he stated in his final interview. “You should \nreally be yourself…why should I worry so much about others? Why shouldn’t I be \nmyself?”  \nIn embracing his own sexual identity and part within the LGBTQ+ community, \nNeil has found improvement in other realms of his life. He feels “more positive, more \nfocused on other things, like my work, dreams, what I contribute. I’m more focused and \nless worried about other things.” With his degree completion and new career presenting a \nfresh start, he is excited to begin a new career at a firm he feels is inclusive and \nsupportive of the LGBTQ+ community, looking forward to being in an environment \nwhere he does not need to separate his professional and interpersonal identities. \n During his final interview, Neil had a breakthrough to share: his first romantic \nrelationship. Though he and his new potential boyfriend initially met through a gay \ndating app, they quickly found that they were looking for a more meaningful relationship: \n[I]n the beginning we didn’t feel really into each other [sexually], just casually \nchatted and had dinner together or something like that. And then, I invited him to \ntravel with me for three days over Thanksgiving break. And after we came back, I \nstarted thinking ‘hmm, maybe I do like this guy’ and he felt the same way!  \n \nHis newfound confidence to explore this relationship has been revelatory for Neil: “It \nfeels wonderful, [I feel] very happy,” he says. “I think it shapes my future in a positive \nway. I feel more confident.” Navigating this relationship represents a new chapter in his \nself-development, and whereas he previously expressed reservation about integrating his \n132 \npersonal and academic/professional identities, he is inspired to seek greater balance in his \nlife:  \nThis kind of feeling is very foreign to me, because I told you I have never been in \nthis kind of relationship before. So I am now trying to learn how to interact with \nhim and how to manage my time and invest some time in this relationship. \n \nAlthough he is realistic regarding the challenges ahead of them – his boyfriend is a \ncurrent exchange student and has another year of study at ASU, then may return home to \nChina or pursue a graduate degree elsewhere, while Neil is moving to California upon \ncompleting his degree shortly – Neil is focused, for now, on exploring what the \nrelationship has to offer. \nResilience and Institutional Engagement: Pea’s Story \nMentorship has had a demonstrable academic impact on Pea. As a Chinese \nlesbian female, Pea has always felt herself to be a minority within her STEM discipline. \nHer mentor, as a young faculty member from a similar academic background, has \nprovided invaluable assistance to Pea not only in navigating her LGBTQ+ identity, but in \nunderstanding American academic culture and career pathways, too. When she joined the \nHUES program, she “was trying to get into the rhythm of [her] academic work.”  The \nmentoring partnership “just fits so well,” she says,  \nand it is so exciting to know I can have someone who is a member of the \ncommunity as well as a professor, and we can talk about it all. He’ll give me \nadvise on how to proceed with academic and professional development things, for \nexample, like how to revise a manuscript that’s been returned and how to see \nthings through the perspectives of faculty and advisors. \n \nHaving had negative experiences with a faculty advisor at her previous institution who \nquestioned her research and was critical of Pea’s career plans, Pea came to her current \ndepartment optimistic but plagued by academic insecurities. Her mentor has helped her \n133 \nregain confidence in her academic abilities, and she explains “we’re both in engineering. \nHe’s been through the whole process, been a grad student, been a postdoc, all that stuff.” \nAs a fellow minority and recognizing the often heterocentric academic culture of their \nfield, Pea’s mentor helped her navigate her new environment. Foremost among the \nlessons she’s learned from him is to “just pace myself and trust the process,” she says, \nand to recognize that in her academic field, research setbacks occur regularly. “I just need \nto be more affirmative,” she says, “and let them go. He thinks of problems as \nopportunities…that’s a huge difference for me.” As a lesbian, Pea often felt enormous \npressure to succeed academically, feeling she needed to “prove herself” capable of \nsucceeding and worrying that any perceived failures in her work would appear reflective \nof her minority status as an LGBTQ+ woman. “I attribute it to a better identity or a firmer \nidentity in myself,” she says of her resilience: \nI don’t necessarily feel embarrassed or get uncomfortable. I think one of the \nthings is that I [would] get anxious about something and make small things bigger \nin my head. I’m working on it. My mentor told me ‘you tend to overthink, and \nyou just need to stop thinking so much.’ I used to think of problems as setbacks, \nsomething I couldn’t solve. But now I’ll think of this as another opportunity. \n \nPea has flourished interpersonally since working with her mentor as well, something she \nattributes to the specific mentoring goals she and her mentor established early on. After \ntwo semesters of mentorship, her academic and sexual identities are “beginning to merge \npretty well,” and she says her general outlook is “significantly better from the beginning \nof her mentorship.” She credits this not only to the investment of her mentor and her \nnewfound community within the LGBTQ+ Toastmasters organization, but to the support \nshe has found within her academic department:  \n134 \nWith my advisor and her husband, it’s okay. With my labmates, it’s okay. And \npeople in the office don’t really care about me being a lesbian. I have learned to \nreach out and ask for help when I need it, and my HUES mentor did a really \nfabulous job of being there when I had questions either about identity or \nacademics. The people I met here made it really easy for me. \n \nFor the first time, Pea “doesn’t have to make the effort” to maintain separate academic \nand interpersonal identities anymore, and that gives her the emotional energy to pursue \nboth more vigorously. \n Having a support system and multiple positive role models has increased Pea’s \ncomfort with her sexuality, too: “I’m more comfortable in my identity [overall],” she \nsays. She specifically attributes this to the influence of her mentors and the individuals \nshe has met through her new LGBTQ+ community connections. “They are accepting of \nwho we are, and they are aspirational. And they just basically show me that something \ncan be done. And they live a happy life,” she notes. “[I think] ‘that could be me!’” Like \nNeil’s, Pea’s mentor is in a long-term relationship, and was the first gay male she has met \nto have done so:  \nHe introduced me to his partner, now, and seeing him and seeing them as normal \npeople and thriving [is aspirational]. It helps me come to terms with it, thinking \nlike I can do it [negotiate relationships in the long term]. \n \nHer mentor’s transparency within his own life and how he navigates identity and \ndisclosure has had an impact, too. “Seeing him, for example, how comfortable he is” has \ninspired Pea to worry less about what others will think of her identity, and has provided \nher a template for her own coming-out process: “The way [my mentor] tackles this \nproblem is like ‘if people ask me I’ll just say it, and I’ll do what I have to do’. It’s a nice \napproach.” \n135 \nPreviously somewhat reserved and closed off to people she didn’t know closely, \nmentorship has allowed Pea to recognize the value in interpersonal relationships to a \ndegree she had previously not considered. Always cautious of expressing too much \ninterest in the personal lives of others, she has learned to be less aloof. “Caring” about \nothers is specifically a newfound skill she has developed: “Like, to be confident [in \nshowing] that I care about something [or someone]. I wasn’t really comfortable doing \nthat before…I felt like I was being nosy if I did that.” Working on boundary issues, both \nher own and what she perceives to be others’, has “made a huge difference” in her \nrelationships. “I’m grateful for it every day,” she says.  \n Finally, mentorship and the communities she has become involved in as a result \nhave had a direct impact on Pea’s career trajectory, too, in following her passions and not \nallowing what she had previously considered a detriment – her LGBTQ+ identity – to \nbecome an asset. Although she always has had a passion for athletics, Pea previously \nworried that such a traditionally heterocentric career pathway might not be the right \nchoice for her. Greater exposure, though, has given her a new confidence: \nAt the beginning of the semester, I was trying to decide if I want to stay in \nacademia or go into industry, and I’m more likely now to go into the industry to \ndo like…I’ll do whatever it takes to get a job related to basketball…that’s my \nmindset now.  \n \nAlways interested in basketball, Pea had thought of it as a men’s sport, and one that \nmight not be accepting of the LGBTQ+ community. Recently, though, Pea has started \nfollowing professional women’s basketball, a sport that is strongly pro-LGBTQ+, and has \nfound inspiration in the players of the local team: “Those women [in the WNBA] seem so \ncool,” she says.  \n136 \n Like Neil, the fulfillment that mentorship has created in her life, allowing her to \nembrace her place in a new community, has translated directly into increased academic \npersistence and success. Whereas she previously struggled with loneliness and \nmaintaining a healthy work-life balance, the communities and relationships mentorship \nhas opened up for her have allowed Pea to find a new balance in her life. While nights \nand weekends were once her least-favorite times, “now it’s probably my favorite time.” \nShe is more engaged in her academic work, once her sole focus, as well: “I can feel \nhappy while still doing it [studying and research]. That’s just a huge change, and I’m so \ngrateful for it. Having more confidence [in all aspects of life] helped. I just realized…I \nam able to enjoy time by myself [now] but when I still need friends to talk to, I can have \nthem.”  \n Overall, she attributes this newfound balance, happiness, and resilience to the \nlessons she has learned from her mentors. “One thing that keeps coming up,” she \nexplains, “is values. I know the importance of my values now.” Now that she has an \nLGBTQ+ community in which she can find others with similar values, she says, she’s not \nso alone, and that makes all the difference in every aspect of her life. “Having a clear \nidentity and values are linked,” she continues. “They help me recognize what I want to \naspire to in myself.” \nPost-mentorship: Resilience and Perceived Social Support \n \n Woven together, the collective experiences of Pat, Neil and Pea tell a compelling, \npowerful tale of challenge, adversity, and – encouragingly – resilience. To see how the \nstories of these three students are fit into the narrative of the university’s larger LGBTQ+ \n137 \ncommunity, data was collected from the pre- and post-intervention personal resilience \ninventories of mentees in the HUES mentoring program. Comparing these data points \nagainst the emergent qualitative tapestry allowed for data triangulation and drove \ndevelopment of a final theory set consistent with a grounded theory approach.  \n To determine if mentorship bolstered LGBTQ+ identity affinity and resilience \namong the broader HUES community, a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was \nconducted using SPSS 24 and Microsoft Excel to test the following null hypothesis: \nH0 There is no difference between pre-intervention and post-intervention median \nvalues across four constructs measuring presence of resilience factors. \nEight undergraduate and graduate student HUES mentees completed the pre-intervention \nassessment as a requirement of program onboarding. All participants were asked to \ncomplete the assessment again in December, but only five submitted responses. Pre- and \npost-intervention median values were approximately symmetrical in distribution, as \nassessed by a histogram with a superimposed normal curve.  \n Examined as a whole, the data revealed a statistically significant median value \nincrease in participants’ ability to identify and perceive support from a mentor or role \nmodel, family, peers or friends, and an LGBTQ+ community or group (z = -3.362, p = \n.001) within a 95% confidence interval (α = 0.05), allowing the null hypothesis to be \nrejected. However, due to the small sample (n = 16) and limited number of data points, \nno statistical significance could be reported when examining the individual constructs, \nthough data within three constructs (mentor/role model (z = -1.826, p = .068); family (z = \n-1.841, p = .066); LGBTQ+ community (z = -1.826, p = .068) approached significance.  \nOf these constructs, only the category of friends/peers (z = -.770, p = .465) failed to \n138 \napproach significance within a 95% confidence interval (α = 0.05).  \n While it is disappointing that statistical analysis could not verify statistical \nsignificance across all constructs, these results are neither discouraging nor unexpected. \nExamining the median pre- and post-intervention scores and corresponding standard \ndeviations allow inference of a more nuanced story from these data points; while not \nstatistically based, they reconcile with the larger qualitative data. \nSupport from LGBTQ+ Mentor or Role Model \n In this section of the personal resilience inventory, participants evaluated the \nsupport they receive from mentors or role models related to LGBTQ+ identity or issues. \nComparison of pre- and post-intervention median scores and standard deviations are \npresented in Table 5: \nTable 5: Perceived Support from An LGBTQ+ Mentor or Role Model \n \nPre-test \nmedian \nPost-test \nmedian \n \nStandard \ndeviation \npre/post \nMedian \ndifference \n       \nMedian and standard deviation \nacross category \n \n3.29 \n \n \n6.35 \n \n \n1.40/0.55 \n \n \n2.57 \n \n \nThere is an LGBTQ+ mentor/role \nmodel who is around when I am in \nneed. \n \n2.88 \n \n \n \n6.20 \n \n \n \n1.62/0.40 \n \n \n \n3.32 \n \n \n \nThere is an LGBTQ+ mentor/role \nmodel with whom I can share joys \nand sorrow.  \n \n2.88 \n \n \n \n6.40 \n \n \n \n1.27/0.49 3.52 \n \n \n \nI have an LGBTQ+ mentor/role \nmodel who is a real source of \ncomfort to me. \n \n4.25 \n \n \n \n6.40 \n \n \n \n1.64/0.80 2.15 \n \n \n \nThere is an LGBTQ+ mentor/role \nmodel in my life who cares about my \nfeelings. \n3.13 \n \n \n6.40 \n \n \n1.05/0.49 3.27 \n \n \n \n139 \n In pre-intervention self-assessment, the median value construct-wide was 3.29. \nParticipants generally did not assess themselves to have strong levels of mentor support \nor role modeling around navigation of LGBTQ+ identities or issues. The lowest pre-\nintervention scores (for ‘there is an LGBTQ+ mentor/role model who is around when I \nam in need’ and ‘there is an LGBTQ+ mentor/role model with whom I can share joys or \nsorrows’) of 2.88 median values indicate most participants disagreed with these \nstatements. The highest median score in this category (4.25) was in assessment of the \nstatement ‘I have an LGBTQ+ mentor/role model who is a real source of comfort to me’.  \n In post-intervention self-assessment, the median score construct-wide rose was \n6.35. Participants agreed strongly with these statements. The greatest change between \npre- and post-intervention median values, demonstrating a 3.25 positive shift, was \nassociated with the statement ‘There is an LGBTQ+ mentor/role model with whom I can \nshare joys and sorrow’. Not only do median scores rise in the post-intervention \nassessment, but standard deviations shrink, confirming a tighter spread of data points \namong participants.

In \nsummarizing the findings of this study, it is useful to return to the two original research \nquestions. \n \n \n146 \nMentoring, LGBTQ+ Identity Construction and Navigation  \n This study was developed in part to determine what the process of LGBTQ+ \nidentity construction looks like for gender and sexual minority students experience at the \ninstitution, and how mentorship affects the perceived identities of these students.  \n For interview participants, lack of LGBTQ+ cultural and social capital was the \nprimary barrier to construction and navigation of strong LGBTQ+ identities. This was \nfostered by identity- and disclosure-related anxiety, social isolation, loneliness and a \nperception of otherness and alienation that was, at various points, nearly socially \nincapacitating and precluded formation of the community membership and social bonds \nnecessary to development of LGBTQ+ cultural and capital and both community and \nidentity affinity. All three struggled with disclosure, concealing their sexual and gender \nidentities, compartmentalizing their lives, and isolating themselves from peers and \nfamily. Alienated and lonely, Neil grew to resent his sexuality exhibiting internalized \nhomophobia, negative identity self-concept, and low cultural LGBTQ+ cultural affinity \nlasting into adulthood.  \n It is also clear that negotiating identities – and more specifically, the stress of \nconcealing them or managing disclosure – has impacted these students’ academic \ntrajectories, too. While all three interviewees characterized themselves as academically \ngifted and driven, fear of disclosure isolated them from peers and their academic \ndepartments. Social isolation, a sense of not belonging, and having nobody to share \nfrustrations and personal struggles with took a toll on all three. Neil started and stopped \nout of graduate school three times before completing his degree, while Pat changed \ndegree programs and career pathways entirely to find a community they felt they \n147 \nbelonged in. These experiences are a stark contrast to Pea, who found immediate \nacceptance upon coming out to peers and faculty, which significantly bolstered her \ndepartmental affinity and reduced the stress and anxiety she’d experienced at a previous \ninstitution. \nMentorship and LGBTQ+ Cultural Capital, Resilience, and Identity \nA second component of this study was to determine how participation in an \nLGBTQ+ mentoring program effects the perceptions of participants in terms of their \ndevelopment of LGBTQ+ cultural capital and resilience, and how accrual of these aid \nparticipants in the adoption of a healthy, salient LGBTQ+ identity.  \nQualitative data indicates mentorship positively affected participants in these \nareas, and that length of engagement with a mentor is a significant factor in these \noutcomes. Mentorship and the acculturation into larger LGBTQ+ communities allowed \nall three interviewees to accrue valuable cultural capital to varying degrees. New to the \nprogram, Pat demonstrated the least growth in terms of cultural capital, resilience, and \nidentity salience. Research indicates mentorship follows a four-stage development cycle \nof initiation, cultivation, maturation and independence (see Appendix P). The initiation \nstage, while often the shortest, is also the most crucial, and is the period in which mentor \nand mentee bond, establishing the rapport and trust necessary for a successful mentoring \nrelationship. Naturally timid, Pat’s initiation phase was longer than those of Neal and \nPea, who bonded with their mentors fairly quickly. Still, in determining the language and \ntools they needed to understand (and allow others to understand) their identities, \nidentifying and articulating specific identity-related anxiety triggers, and focusing on \ndevelopment of coping strategies to mitigate that anxiety, Pat was able to steps to begin \n148 \nengaging more confidently within their communities and begin making breakthroughs in \nnavigating the interplay between their gender and sexual identities.  \nMeanwhile, with their longer HUES affiliation, Neil and Pea exhibited greater \ndevelopment of LGBTQ+ cultural capital, resilience and identity salience. Moving into \nthe final stages of a mentoring relationship – maturation and independence, characterized \nby growing mentee agency and a realignment as equal peers as the mentor facilitates the \nmentee’s entrance into a larger community – Neil had developed a robust LGBTQ+ self-\nconcept at exit from the program and was far less reticence in embracing his sexual \norientation as a component of his larger salient identity. Armed with increased LGBTQ+ \nsocial and cultural capital, he had the confidence to explore deeper interpersonal and \nromantic relationships than previously possible. Pea, having established a strong rapport \nwith her mentor, was moving quickly from the cultivation to maturation stages of \nmentorship; with a deep, trusting bond formed with her mentor, the goals developed early \nin her mentorship were paying rich dividends insofar as acculturation, entrance into \nlarger community networks, and resilience development.  \nData Triangulation  \n The emergent metanarrative of these interviews provides a rich, vibrant and \nsometimes heartrending – but often heartening and moving – account of these students’ \nshared experiences. While less richly hued and personally compelling, comparisons of \nquantitative data from pre- and post-intervention personal resilience assessments \nsubstantiate the general themes running throughout the interviews.  \n Presence of mentors or LGBTQ+ role models. Of the four relationship \ncategories represented on the personal resilience assessment, it is hardly surprising, given \n149 \nthe overwhelmingly positive interactions described in interviews, that the presence of \nmentor figures/LGBTQ+ role models improved the dramatically upon participation in the \nHUES program across participants, eclipsing even the support participants felt they \nreceived from peers or friends. Nor is it surprising that, prior to program participation, \nHUES students rated the presence of an LGBTQ+ mentor or role model as something \nconspicuously absent in their lives. Navigation of unfamiliar, even threatening territory \nwithout the guidance of someone with shared lived experience was a refrain throughout \nall interviews. \n Family dynamics and relationships. Quantitative data suggests an increased \nconfidence in navigating relationships with families is a commonality shared among all \nHUES participants. While both pre- and post-intervention scores in this section were the \nlowest in the personal resilience inventory, a positive median value shift on post-\ninventory assessments in participants’ assessment of their abilities to share problems and \nconcerns with their families post-engagement with LGBTQ+ mentorship directly bears \nout the testimony of interview participants. Like the improved outlooks shared by Pea \nand Neal (and to a lesser degree Pat), there is reason to believe these can be attributed to \nencouragement, inspiration, confidence-building and a sense of identity affinity and pride \ninstilled by mentorship. It is also noteworthy that just as HUES participants evaluated \nfamily relationships as the least robust among the relationship categories assessed, those \nwere the relationships interview participants struggled with the most. That Neil and Pea’s \nrelationships with their parents shifted as they came to embrace Western notions of \nindividualism – demonstrated by their determination to place their own happiness on \nequal footing with their need to respect their parents – indicates that mentorship and \n150 \ndevelopment of LGBTQ+ cultural affinity allowed them to successfully navigate their \ncultural and sexual identities in a way that allowed their LGBTQ+ identities to achieve \ngreater salience. \nSupport from friends and peers. With participants in the HUES program \nactually reporting marginally lower connectivity to and support from friends and peers on \nthe post-intervention assessment, the values in this category initially seem \ncounterintuitive. However, as participants in the research study became embedded in new \nLGBTQ+ communities and increasingly viewed their mentors as sources of guidance and \nsupport, their reliance upon existing networks – academic cohorts and peer groups – \ndiminished. Interviews were completed before post-intervention data was collected, so \nthere was no opportunity to address the phenomenon directly with research study \nparticipants, but it stands to reason that as participants become engaged within LGBTQ+ \ncommunities, the shared experience of the LGBTQ+ networks provide a ‘safer space’ to \nseek the emotional support they previously went to peers for. It’s reasonable to assume \nparticipants’ perceptions of the levels of support from their friends diminished in contrast \nto that they received through mentorship and engagement with LGBTQ+ communities. \nFurther credence that mentoring fundamentally shifts the group memberships and \nrelationships for participants can be deduced from post-intervention evaluation of the \nlevel to which participants reported they can share joys and sorrows with peers and \nfriends, which did increase over pre-intervention scores. Across interviews, increased \nopenness, transparency, and willingness to engage with peers – coupled with less social \ninhibition in doing so – was an emergent effect of mentorship.  \n151 \nConnection and affinity to LGBTQ+ communities. Due to the demographics of \nthe research interview group – specifically, the fact that two were international students, \none a student new to their academic program, the institution and the state, and all three \ngraduate students – the results of the pre- and post-intervention personal resilient \nassessments verified the lack of LGBTQ+ community engagement among interviewees \nwas not isolated. Pre-intervention data indicated HUES participants did not specifically \nseek LGBTQ+ communities or see these communities as integral to their identity \ndevelopment, exploration or psychosocial support; this aligned with the experiences of \ntwo interviewees, including one (Neal) who actively avoided public interaction with \nLGBTQ+ communities. Just as the prospect of increased community connection became \na salient goal for interviewees over the course of their mentorship, all attributing positive \nchange in their ability to navigate their sexual and/or gender identities, acceptance of \ntheir identities, and increased comfort in disclosing these identities to non-LGBTQ+ \npeers with the inspiration, support, and guidance they found through LGBTQ+ \ncommunity membership, so did participants completing the post-inventory assessment \nindicate an increased affinity for these communities. \nBoth quantitative and qualitative data support the theory that increased LGBTQ+ \nacculturation and mentoring support have bolstered the general resilience of program \nparticipants. In this study, participants’ post-intervention scores showed measurable \npositive change in terms of emotional support, guidance and freedom of \nexpression/ability to be open across a range of interpersonal domains (friends, family and \ncommunities).  In personal interviews, participants not were able to identify specific ways \n152 \nand situations in which they had become more resilient, but were able to specifically \nidentify the ways in which they mindfully maintain and build upon that resilience.  \n \nEmergent Theories  \n Ultimately, though the HUES study encapsulates just a small fraction of the \ncollective experience of LGBTQ+ students at Arizona State University and further study \nis certainly needed, some generalized theories can be drawn from this project.  \n First, participation in an LGBTQ+ mentoring program, in which both mentor and \nmentee share the similar experience of being a sexual or gender minority and have faced \nsimilar challenges, is an effective means of helping students develop the LGBTQ+ \ncultural capital and resilience to develop a healthy, salient LGBTQ+ identity \ncharacterized by positive self-concept, an asset-based developmental mindset, and robust \nidentity affinity. These effects are cumulative and gradual; mentorship is a long-term \nrelationship by both mentor and mentee in which trust, rapport, and authenticity must be \nestablished and reinforced in order for the mentee to most fully benefit from the \nrelationship.  \nSecondly, although advances have been made in terms of LGBTQ+ acceptance \nand representation, both on a national scale and institutionally, these students continue \nfacing significant barriers in constructing and navigating robust, resilient LGBTQ+ \nidentities, particularly if they are simultaneously balancing the pressures exerted by \nconflicting cultural identities, as in the cases of Neil and Pea. Primary barriers include \nanxiety over disclosure and compartmentalization of personal and community identities \nthat result in social isolation, community disconnect, and alienation exacerbated by \n153 \nwithdrawal from families, peers, and other support structures. Secondary barriers include \nidentity non-affinity and misperceptions about LGBTQ+ people that preclude entrance \ninto larger LGBTQ+ communities where shared experience and community support are \ncritical in mitigating the effects of minority stress. Collectively, these challenges are an \nimpediment to LGBTQ+ students’ academic persistence and achievement. \nFrom the accumulated stories of HUES participants, it becomes clear that \nmentorship specifically within the context of LGBTQ+ identity development and \nacculturation plays a key role in helping students navigate the hurdles of achieving \nidentity salience. For each participant, regardless of family background or culture, \nidentity construction pre-mentorship was a period characterized by angst, frustration, and \nisolation. Through mentorship specifically around the navigation of LGBTQ+ identities \nand community exploration, each gained comfort in disclosing their identities and de-\ncompartmentalizing their interpersonal and sexual or gender identities, gained valuable \ncommunity connections and support, gained the social currency to navigate LGBTQ+ \ncommunities, and found greater satisfaction in life generally. Furthermore, interpersonal \nmentorship fosters and reaffirms participants’ senses of belonging within the university \nand its communities, increases their confidence in their own abilities to overcome \nobstacles, and encourages them to ‘dream big’ and envision their own place in the world.  \nMentorship provides a gateway to larger LGBTQ+ community membership and \naffinity, which are absolutely imperative to overcoming negative identity-related self-\nconcept, accrual of LGBTQ+ cultural competencies, and navigation of students’ multiple \n(academic, social, and personal) identities. Community membership not only offers \nLGBTQ+ students support in developing robust salient identities and resilience against \n154 \nminority stressors, but is critical in maintaining resiliency. The presence of a stable \nLGBTQ+ community is a grounding influence as individuals progress through the \nongoing work of achieving identity synthesis, and losing community support, once \nfostered, can lead to identity foreclosure or disruption. Finally, mentorship and \ndevelopment of LGBTQ+ identity and community affinity foster civic responsibility and \ngreater urgency to ‘pay it forward’ in helping others navigate their emerging identities \nand the challenges therein. Mentorship thus becomes a pipeline elevating both the mentee \nand the larger community, with mentees becoming more interested in or engaged with \nissues around social justice or community activism. \n \n \n  \n155 \nCHAPTER 5 \nDISCUSSION \nImplications of Research Findings \n \n As both the personal interviews and the quantitative data of this study suggest, \nmentorship plays a key role in mitigating the challenges that LGBTQ+ students face at \nthis institution. The role modeling and community development mentorship facilitates \ncan offer rich rewards for participants in mentoring programs and lead to stronger \ninstitutional engagement and academic persistence and success. Just as significantly, \nthough, the emergent metanarrative offers some substantial data regarding the mentoring \nprocess. \nThe Importance of Support at all Levels  \n Considerable institutional focus, both here and nationwide, focuses on creating \ndynamic, supportive and inclusive co-curricular environments at the undergraduate level, \nparticularly for incoming first-year students, with first-year on-campus living \nrequirements, mandatory freshman seminars on adapting to college life or study skills, \nand other programming designed to ease the college transition. This study highlights the \nimportance of institutional social affinity and community engagement for LGBTQ+ \nstudents not only at the undergraduate level and through the initial LGBTQ+ identity \ndiscovery and navigational processes, but also throughout students’ time at these \ninstitutions. Graduate and transfer students, for instance, may never live on campus and \nbe immersed in the larger campus culture, and therefore be unaware of opportunities and \nresources. Many LGBTQ+ students, if given the option, may opt to live off-campus for \nfear of roommate difficulties or other interpersonal conflict.  \n156 \nFurthermore, this nation’s higher education system is rapidly improving its \nunderstanding and serving of the co-curricular needs of LGBTQ+ students. LGBTQ+ \nsupport clubs and centers becoming increasingly common both within the K12 system \nand at colleges and universities nationwide, and universities must be ready to provide \nstructured support allowing an uninterrupted service pipeline. For undergraduate students \nentering this institution from a high school with a robust gay-straight alliance or graduate \nstudents coming from an undergraduate institution with a highly visible LGBTQ+ or \nmulticultural community center or resources, the transition to an institution lacking these \ncan be a crippling experience.  \nMentoring as a Sustained Relationship and the Importance of Peer Dynamics \n As discussed briefly elsewhere, participant interviews presented a compelling \nargument that in order to be effective, mentorship must be sustained and intentionally \ndeveloped; whereas coaching or teaching may be transactional, mentorship is a long-term \nrelationship requiring the establishment of trust. In interviews, it was readily apparent \nthat mentorship is not a quick-fix solution to the challenges facing these students, but a \nrelationship that must be established and nurtured by both mentor and mentee in order for \nits full effects to be seen. Additionally, though one participant (Pea) benefitted from the \nacademic guidance her mentor could provide as a faculty member in a field adjacent to \nher own, the relationships of all three participants to their mentors, regardless of their \nmentor’s institutional affiliation and background, was that of a peer within the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. Though the guidance of their mentors influenced their interactions with their \ndepartmental advisors or academic mentors, the mentoring relationships explored in this \nstudy informed, rather than superceded, the relationships each had within their academic \n157 \nprograms, reaffirming the importance of strong LGBTQ+ peer groups in strengthening \nthe connections and affinity these students develop for the larger institution. \n \nThe Role of Cultural Expectation in LGBTQ+ Identity Development \n The nuanced influences of larger cultural paradigms in informing LGBTQ+ \nidentity also played a crucial factor in this study. Though not initially a primary area of \nfocus, over the course of the study it became apparent that although all three interview \nparticipants faced common challenges in the development and navigation of emerging \nLGBTQ+ identities, the manifestation and impact of these challenges was influenced by \nlarger cultural contexts.  \nFor instance, while each struggled with the stress of coming out to family \nmembers and expressed significant anxiety around disclosure, the cause of anxiety for \nNeil and Pea was centered around the impact their sexual identities would have on their \nfamilies insofar as the social stigma their coming out would have on their families’ \nrelationships and social standing within their larger communities. Their disclosural \nmotivation was a matter of family responsibility, with both subjugating their individual \nidentities in order to protect their families from the judgment of their communities. \nMeanwhile, Pat’s perceptions of their family’s acceptance and understanding of their \nidentities was influenced in part by the American sociopolitical landscape; a significant \ncomponent of their reluctance to engage with and disclose their identities to their family \nwas their parents’ political affiliations. At several points in their interview sessions, Pat \nidentified the 2016 presidential election as a turning point in their relationship with \nfamily members and the cause of a significant rift.  \n158 \nCultural norming came up several times throughout interviews with Neil and Pea \nand indicated an awareness of cultural upbringing and difference in the development of \nan LGBTQ+ identity. This was most significantly displayed through Neil’s growing \ndisenfranchisement with Chinese culture and his assertion that the reluctance within \nChinese society to discuss matters of sexuality was a “violence from the majority” and \nhis questioning of whether the coming-out story depicted in the 2018 film Love, Simon \nwas representative of the American LGBTQ+ experience. Cultural norms were also \naddressed in Pea’s admission that American cultural conventions around familiarity and \nphysical displays of platonic affection remained a challenge for her, her confession that \n“she has no gaydar” when it comes to American women, and her acknowledgement that \nlack of understanding around American dating and social conventions made her more \nnervous about dating American women than other Chinese women. \nThe family-centric focus of Neil and Pea’s concern can likely be explained by the \ncollectivist nature of Chinese society, while Pat’s more self-focused concern reflects the \ndominant individualist nature of American society. These findings indicate that the larger \nrole of cultural norms and dimensions in group identity development, as explored further \nby Hofestede (2001) and Brewer and Venaik (2011), plays a significant role in the \ndevelopment of an LGBTQ+ identity. In the case of these students, negotiating cultural \nlandscapes (both its social and political dimensions) occurred simultaneously with and \nwas integral to navigation of their LGBTQ+ identities. It demonstrates that although the \nLGBTQ+ experience – and the minority stress it engenders – has universal constants, \nnuances of are inextricably tied to the formation of larger cultural identities. \n \n159 \nDisclosure and LGBTQ+ Identity: A Critical Measure \nFinally, the study indicates that the role of disclosure and decision-making \nprocesses behind it plays a more significant and ongoing role in LGBTQ+ identity \ndevelopment than previously believed, particularly in its importance to the mitigation of \nminority stress and development of identity salience. Whereas previous LGBTQ+ \nidentity models focus on relationship milestones or community membership as \nbarometers of LGBTQ+ identity salience, and treat attaining comfort in identity \ndisclosure as a hallmark of specific stages/phases of development, interviews over the \ncourse of this study indicate disclosure and the motivations behind disclosure or \nnondisclosure are sufficiently critical to LGBTQ+ identity development to merit \ncontinued study.  \nOur Many Hues: Collective Narrative, Shared Experience, and a Call to Action \n A defining tenet of this institution’s charter is that it seeks to be measured not by \nwhom it excludes, but by whom it includes and how they succeed (ASU, 2019). As an \ninstitution, its community – faculty, staff and students – take pride in and are inspired by \nthis guiding principle. It carries an implicit underlying assumption that students of all \nbackgrounds, abilities, cultures, values and beliefs should and can find their own space to \nthrive. This university has built its identity on this and invests substantially in the holistic \nstudent experience, both in the classroom and in the larger campus community, with the \nbelief that an immersive, engaging university experience benefits its students, its \ncommunities, and society. \n However, the university defines success numerically – through the number of \nstudents it attracts and enrolls, through persistence and graduation rates, through grade-\n160 \npoint averages, student research output, and student career placement and trajectories. Its \nadministration defines success in the number of opportunities provided its students for \npersonal and academic enrichment, for community development, and in the way it fosters \nopportunities for students to grow into leaders, innovators, and community members. \nOffering a place for all students to become anything they want or need to be gives them \nagency. This is the philosophy underlying its student-driven, staff supported engagement \nmodel; the university’s role as an institution is to provide the space and the resources to \nsupport the student experience, not determine it. By the numbers, the university is \nsucceeding at its mission – the institution has been on an upward trajectory for well over \na decade, breaking enrollment and graduation records, eclipsing other institutions in \nresearch spending and climbing national rankings. By all numeric accounts, ASU is doing \na good job. \n What the numbers can’t tell us, though, are the experiences of the university’s \nstudents. That’s why the stories collected and pieced together here are so important. Their \nstories have been at the heart of every step in the development of the HUES LGBTQ+ \nmentoring program. They guided me though the initial needs assessments and interviews, \nwhen I first realized the extent to which greater community connection was needed in \norder for these students to reach their potential. They made me realize that mentorship \nmight provide that connection, and they shaped the development, assessment, and \ncontinual improvement to the program.  \nSetting out to examine how this institution was serving its LGBTQ+ students, I \nwas startled by early revelations. I spoke with a student leader, engaged and committed to \nadvocacy for the LGBTQ+ student community and an outstanding future public servant \n161 \nwho had only stumbled upon student engagement opportunities after three years at the \ninstitution. I wondered how much more impactful they could have been on their \ncommunity had they connected earlier. I empathized with a graduating student who first \ncame out at fourteen but confessed to loneliness, lack of connection and cluelessness in \napproaching – no less dating – people he was interested. His lack of rudimentary \nLGBTQ+ cultural currency surprised me, given the degree to which he otherwise had \naccepted and integrated his LGBTQ+ identity. As a passionate student affairs \nprofessional and a believer in the importance of the college experience in forming one’s \nlifelong identities and social competencies, I grieved for a student who felt so \nmarginalized and uncomfortable within the university environment that he avoided \ncampus entirely, eventually attempting to complete his degree online through another \ninstitution. Originally scheduled to graduate over a year ago, he still hasn’t.  \nListening to the stories of these research participants, learning about their \nbackgrounds, concerns and stresses, and their challenges and triumphs was at once \nbittersweet and encouraging. I recalled my own years of uncertainty, distress, and the \noverwhelming struggle to find a place I fit, and wondered why, after all these years – \ndecades, actually – LGBTQ+ students still had to struggle with the same challenges. For \nhow inclusive this university professes to be, and for all the data demonstrating the \nimportance of engagement for this vulnerable student population, the fact that more \nhasn’t been done was frustrating. \nAt the same time, these sessions proved cathartic. When Neil likened his \nexcitement in first realizing there was a larger, supportive community of gay men out \nthere to “finding a new continent,” I understood precisely what he meant. When he \n162 \nannounced, in his final interview, that he had met someone and they had started dating, I \ncouldn’t have been prouder of him for overcoming his fear of embracing his community, \nrealizing that “they are not monsters…but are just like you [him].”  When Pat, who broke \ndown in tears frequently in our first meeting, started smiling and bringing home-baked \ncookies to interviews, I was thrilled to see their growing comfort within what they \nincreasingly saw as a safe space. And when Pea described her first interaction with her \nown new LGBTQ+ network, saying it gave her hope, “helped [her] visualize a life,” and \nmade her feel like she finally had a family here, I couldn’t come up with the words to \ndescribe my happiness. When she texted me a month after the study concluded, saying \nshe’d gone home to China and come out to her family, I actually choked up a bit.  \nThese stories are about success. These stories are not the isolated experiences of a \nhandful of LGBTQ+ students at this institution. They are the shared cultural experience \nof all in the LGBTQ+ community. These stories deserve to be heard, and this university \nhas an obligation under its charter to hear them and respond. \n Currently ASU does not have a dedicated space for its LGBTQ+ students – a \nplace explicitly created where LGBTQ+ students can go knowing they will not face bias, \nconfrontation, or conflict around their identities, and where they feel comfortable \nexamining these identities. This is what early needs assessments indicate, what interviews \nsay, and this is what their stories illustrate. The institution has a mandate to create \ninclusive, intersectional spaces where students of all identities and cultures may explore \ntheir commonality. It has removed community siloes and encourages students to critically \nexamine and navigate the confluences of their myriad identities, encouraging all students \nto explore and better understand their place in a larger society. In doing so, it strives to \n163 \ncreate a culture where all students, regardless of personal history, background, or identity \nmay find commonality. This is the space Student and Cultural Engagement/International \nStudent Engagement and its cultural identity-based coalitions exist in. These are safe \nspaces, but they are also brave spaces. These are spaces where students can explore what \nit means to be black, or gay, or an indigenous person within the context of a larger \ncommunity – but not a place to significantly explore what it means to be black, gay, or \nindigenous in the first place. Though the matter seems one of nuance or semantics, it’s \nnot insignificant. Before students can bravely explore what it means to navigate their \ncultural, political and social landscapes from the intersections of their various identities, \nthey must have a space to become comfortable inhabiting those individual identities. \nBefore they can integrate an identity into the larger schema of their interpersonal make-\nup, they must understand what it is to inhabit that identity. \nThe model ASU ascribes to assumes students enter the institution with a salient \nidentity: international students bring the traditions and currencies of their native cultures; \nstudents of minority ethnic or religious backgrounds arrive with the rich capital afforded \nthem by their backgrounds. For these students, navigating and thriving in ASU’s \ncommunity entails finding the dovetails between their culture of origin and the \ninstitution’s. Many but not all LGBTQ+ students are in an altogether unique situation \nupon entrance to the university, though, as an LGBTQ+ identity is arrived at rather than \nwith. As in the case of Pat, Neil and Pea, these students come into an LGBTQ+ identity \ntabula rasa and must simultaneously explore what it means to be part of a sexual or \ngender minority community and a part of their larger community. The attrition rates of \nLGBTQ+ college students nationwide – as discussed elsewhere by Nicolazzo and others, \n164 \nand borne out by the challenges faced by Pat, Neil and Pea – bear testament to the \ndifficulty of threading together an understanding of one’s own personal identity and at \nthe same time finding a place in the larger university community.   \nThis is why a visible space dedicated to the LGBTQ+ community is important. \nASU promotes and provides both safe and brave spaces for its sexual and gender \nminority students, but further efforts institution-wide must be made to create a \ncomfortable space for these students, too. Precedent exists within ASU: considerable \nresources are invested in providing incoming first-year students, international students, \nveteran students, students with disabilities and even transfer and graduate students with \nthe space and resources to explore what it means to be a minority student in the context \nof their new environment. These resources give these students a space to explore what it \nmeans what it means to be a minority – a college student, a veteran, a differently abled \nperson, someone from a different culture or society – while simultaneously finding the \ncultural and material resources to thrive at the university both within that cultural context \nand within the larger context of ‘student’ alongside a community of peers and faculty or \nstaff who have ‘been there’ and implicitly understand the challenges of navigating that \ntransition. \nFor students with well-developed, salient LGBTQ+ identities who have found the \nsupport and resources to develop the cultural currency to be – first and foremost – a \nmember of an LGBTQ+ community, the student-driven programming and resources \nprovided by SCE/ISE and the Rainbow Coalition are enough. For the Pats, Neils, and \nPeas of the university, though – students struggling to reconcile a fundamental core \ncomponent of their personal identity – providing visible, accessible support resources and \n165 \na sense of community are important. This is vitally important to their development. \nStudents ask for these spaces at the institution; mentorship and the community \ndevelopment entailed can provide students the resilience-building capacity to create their \nown spaces to grown and flourish in their personal identities – the stories of its students \nindicate this.  \nThe university’s leadership tells students the institution is an inclusive \nenvironment, a space for all students, and that it does not need a specific one for \nLGBTQ+ students. But unless they are specifically involved in its LGBTQ+ student \norganizations or leadership, students do not feel they have access to it. This institution \nneeds to provide them the resources and agency to create that space safely and feel like \nthey have community. That is where mentorship comes in. ASU prides itself on offering \na student-driven, staff-supported engagement model. Mentoring at its heart is student-\ndriven. It is staff- or faculty- or peer-responsive. It caters to the demographic-specific \ncommunity identity and resilience development of these students not to isolate them from \nthe larger university community or to eschew inclusion, but as a means of entrance to that \nlarger inclusive community. \nThe HUES program is a good starting point. Its mentors are committed and \nimpactful; a proud moment for me was when they recently were nominated for and \nreceived the Committee for Campus Inclusion’s Catalyst Award for igniting and creating \ntransformation within the institution. With the proper support, HUES has the potential to \npositively impact the experiences of many more students, touching the lives of faculty \nand staff and creating a stronger, multigenerational LGBTQ+ community within the \ninstitution. It has the potential to become the entry point into a larger institutional culture \n166 \nfor LGBTQ+ students, a cultural nursery where gender and sexual minority students can \nfeel supported in exploring and coming to understand what it means to be gay, lesbian, \nbisexual, transgender, nonbinary, asexual or queer.  \nProgram Sustainability  \nTo reach its full potential and ensure its sustainability, HUES needs to be \nimplemented at a higher institutional level. Relocating HUES – housing it under the Vice \nProvost for Inclusion and Community Engagement or the Dean of Students Office, for \ninstance – would offer it the institutional support and wider visibility needed to thrive, \ngrow and support the needs of ASU’s broader LGBTQ+ student community.  \nCurrent Limitations \n While yielding rich qualitative data, the HUES study is only a starting point in \nmore fully understanding the complex needs and experiences of LGBTQ+ students at this \ninstitution. This current study had several significant limitations, with sample size and \ndemographic and study duration being the most notable; by expanding HUES into a \nuniversity-wide enterprise, there is an opportunity to develop a testbed for continued \nLGBTQ+ student engagement research. Addressing the following areas will not only \nyield richer and more comprehensive data, but will improve upon the fidelity of the \nstudy. \n Sample size. Though the qualitative component of this study was designed to \ninclude the case studies of just three students as a matter of manageability, the initial \nresearch concept called for a significantly larger quantitative data set of minimally 25 \nstudents completing both the pre- and post-intervention personal resilience assessment. \nDue to staffing resources within HUES’ home unit, recruitment challenges limited the \n167 \nnumber of students entering the program. Though program membership continued to \ngrow throughout the semester, data from participants joining the program and completing \nthe pre-intervention personal resilience inventory more than a month after program \nlaunch was not included in pre/post comparisons. In order to ensure broader \nrepresentation of both student demographic and experience, future study (as well as the \ncontinued viability of the HUES program) require a significantly larger participant \npopulation. Grounded in an action research paradigm, HUES is a social laboratory. The \nthree years’ work with ASU’s LGBTQ+ student community resulting in the mentoring \nprogram has scratched the surface of the institution’s LGBTQ+ student experience; \nmoving forward, it is important to plumb the depths. Expanding HUES into a broader \ninitiative would not only allow wider impact among ASU’s estimated 6,000 to 12,000 \nLGBTQ+ students, but would ensure the program’s simultaneous evolution with their \nneeds. \n Sample demographic. A majority of early HUES participants, including those \ncompleting the pre-intervention personal resilience assessment in August, were graduate \nstudents, and their experience with the university may differ from undergraduates, who \ntypically live on campus for their first year of study and are thus more likely to be \nconnected to the campus community. Although some representation was achieved across \nthe sexual and gender identity spectrum, multiple communities (FtM and MtF \ntransgender, asexual, bisexual male) were not represented in the larger HUES population. \nAdditionally, in such a small sample size, communities may not have been represented \nproportionally. For instance, preliminary research conducted through a sample of 55 \nLGBTQ+ undergraduate students indicated 75% identified as bisexual or sexually fluid, \n168 \nwhile only two HUES members at launch identified as such. Nor were any members of \nthe program involved in the Rainbow Coalition or other LGBTQ+ student communities \non campus. Finally, the experiences of two research study participants of international \norigin, while rich in information, may not be representative either of the institution’s \ndomestic student population or of students from other international communities. As \ndiscussed elsewhere, evidence exists that the LGBTQ+ experience, though sharing \ncommon challenges, is not universal, with specific sociopolitical dimensions unique to \nparticipants’ cultures of origin influencing their perceptions and navigation of an \nLGBTQ+ identity. A larger population size in future studies would allow not only for \ngreater representation across the LGBTQ+ spectrum, but of how an LGBTQ+ identity is \ndeveloped and navigated in conjunction with multiple identities (ethnicities, cultural and \nreligious backgrounds). \n Study duration. All pre-intervention quantitative data came from participants \nentering HUES in August; all post-intervention quantitative data was collected in \nDecember. Because a majority of HUES participants entered the program mid-semester, \nonly pre-intervention personal resilient assessment data could be used for them in this \ncurrent study, as post-intervention data would be skewed by shorter mentoring \nparticipation times. Both current mentoring research and the experiences of the three \ninterview participants suggest the benefits of mentorship are cumulative; therefore, \ntracking and study of post-intervention quantitative data and qualitative interviews in any \nsubsequent research into mentoring efficacy and outcomes should be conducted \nlongitudinally at program entrance, the one-year, and two-year marks.  \n \n169 \nRecommendations for Ongoing Study \n While the HUES study focuses on the experiences and challenges LGBTQ+ \nstudents have faced in developing and navigating their emerging identities and \nestablished a generalized connection between LGBTQ+ peer mentorship and increased \nability to accrue cultural competencies and reinforce identity affinity, the specific \nmechanisms and impact of mentorship in contributing to these changes should be more \ncomprehensively measured. Pre- and post-intervention administration of the personal \nresilience assessment suggested a correlation between mentorship and perceived support \nfrom family and peers and the influence of role models and an LGBTQ+ community \naround resilience development in creating and managing an LGBTQ+ identity; further \nexamination of the mentoring relationships developed in the program may provide \nadditional insight on the specific elements of and approaches to mentorship that most \nimpacted development of these resilience factors. Further study should specifically \ninclude the perspectives of both mentees and their mentors to examine the dynamics of \nthese relationships; although interviews with mentors about experiences working with \ntheir students were intentionally not addressed in this study in order to center this \nresearch on the disclosure and experience of participants, interviews with mentoring \npairs, focus groups consisting of mentors and/or mentees, and collection of mentoring \nlogs from mentors may further illuminate the ways in which mentorship affected \nmentee’s personal identity development and resilience. Additionally, further qualitative \nresearch in the form of continued interviews with a new group of participants from a \nbroader or different demographic range (undergraduate students, students currently \ninvolved in LGBTQ+ communities and with varying levels of LGBTQ+ identity salience, \n170 \nstudents representing different places on the LGBTQ+ continuum, and students with \nother national, religious, or cultural backgrounds) will be useful in determining which \nperceptions, experiences and challenges exposed in this study can be generalized to a \nbroader LGBTQ+ community and which may be demographically or situationally \nunique. \nRecommendations for Program Development \nTo ensure the HUES program more broadly addresses the influence of the \nmultiple identities and related experiences students bring into the institution, further \nprogramming around the situating of their LGBTQ+ identities within the context of larger \nintercultural perspectives and challenges should be developed. While current \nprogramming explores the development of LGBTQ+ specific cultural capital as a means \nof developing identity resilience, explorations of intersectionality – the power dynamics \ninherent to students’ multiple identities and their intersections – will allow students to \nmore fully frame their LGBTQ+ identities within larger cultural narratives and lead to \ngreater agency-creation. Not only will this foster greater holistic identity development \nand resilience for program participants, but it will provide greater, more generalized data \nregarding the LGBTQ+ student experience both at this institution and on a larger scale. \nAdditionally, as the HUES program grows, it will be important to create a more \ncomprehensive, robust mentor training. While the initial cohort of mentors was selected \nbased on the level of experience mentors in working with LGBTQ+ populations specific \nto community engagement or previous mentoring experience, a central key to the \nsustainability of HUES is the creation of a mentoring pipeline, with mentees in the \nprogram returning as mentors to incoming participants. While the experience and \n171 \nperspectives these would-be mentors have gained through their own participation in the \nprogram will prove valuable in working with their own mentees, specific training around \nstudent and identity development theory, intercultural competencies, and agency-creation \n– in addition to the mechanics of mentorship, intentional conversations, and goal-setting \n– will be vital to the success of their own mentees. \nChanging the Narrative: Further Recommendations \n Should an LGBTQ+ mentorship program be adopted elsewhere within the \ninstitution, the HUES program provides a promising template for resilience- and identity-\nbased mentorship. However, with the right support, it also has the potential to become \nsomething much larger and capable of sustained, university-wide impact: an initiative \nconnecting student, staff and faculty LGBTQ+ communities at this institution, offering \nmentorship, community engagement programming, and social networking opportunities \nfor the continuing psychosocial and identity development support of all of us. ASU’s \nLGBTQ+ community is a small one even within this large university. In numerous \nconversations I’ve had with students, faculty, staff and administration over the course of \nthe past three years, a recurrent source of frustration from all parties is how fractured and \nisolated we remain. Using HUES as a community platform holds the potential to bridge \nthese disparate groups – offering LGBTQ+ faculty and staff the opportunity to make a \nbroader, tangible impact, providing a sense of belonging and affinity for students and \ncreating a robust environment that truly fosters the inclusivity that this institution \nidealizes. In leveraging the LGBTQ+ community’s collective lived experience, resources, \nand passion, ASU can leverage the voices of these faculty, staff and students to help its \nstudents create a new narrative: one of hope, inspiration, resilience and success.  \n172 \nREFERENCES \nAdams, S.

We work closely in conjunction with \nthe Rainbow Coalition and Office of Student and Cultural Engagement. We are currently \nconducting a study to determine what unique needs the LGBTQ+ student population at ASU have \nin association with student success, what obstacles LGBTQ+ students perceive as barriers in their \nsuccess at ASU, and what resources LGBTQ+ students would like to see a greater focus or \nemphasis on at ASU. \n \nWe are asking for your help, which will involve your participation in an interview about your \nexperiences as part of the LGBTQ+ community at ASU. We expect the interview will take about \n30-45 minutes of your time. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You have \nbeen recruited for participation through your association with ASU’s Rainbow Coalition or \nmembership in an LGBTQ+ student club or organization. \n \nThe long-term goal of this study is to provide baseline student data and best practice guidelines \nfor development of a new peer-to-peer and group mentoring program for LGBTQ+ students at \nASU. Our LGBTQ+ students are unique in their specific psychosocial and non-academic needs at \nthe university, and we sincerely hope you will help us positively redefine ASU’s relationship with \nits LGBTQ+ student population.  \n \nAny responses you provide will be kept confidential, and all contact information and \ncorrespondence will be maintained only in secure electronic files on authentication-protected \nuniversity servers. Results of this study may be used in reports, presentations or publications, but \nparticipants will only be identified by pseudonym. Audio transcripts and/or a written summary of \nthe interview will be available to you upon request. Due to the sensitive nature of some questions \nregarding your experiences as a part of the LGBTQ+ community, some topics or questions in this \nsurvey may be emotionally uncomfortable to some participants. If you become uncomfortable \nwith the interview at any point, you retain the right to decline to answer any questions or \ndiscontinue the interview. \n \nBy clicking on this link and submitting the brief participant screening survey, you are stating you \nare aware of all terms and potential risks associated with participation in this research and consent \nto participate, and that you are at least 18 years of age.

It is one of the \nmost significant developmental processes in the lives of LGBT people. Coming out is \nabout recognizing, accepting, expressing and sharing ones’ sexual orientation with \noneself and others.  \n \nStage 1: Identity Confusion \nThis is the \"Who am I?\" stage associated with the feeling that one is different from peers, \naccompanied by a growing sense of personal alienation. The person begins to be \nconscious of same-sex feelings or behaviors and to label them as such. It is rare at this \nstage for the person to disclose inner turmoil to others. \n  \nStage 2: Identity Comparison \nThis is the rationalization or bargaining stage where the person thinks, \"I may be a \nhomosexual, but then again I may be bisexual,\" \"Maybe this is just temporary,\" or, \"My \nfeelings of attraction are simply for just one other person of my own sex and this is a \nspecial case.\" There is a heightened sense of not belonging anywhere with the \ncorresponding feeling that \"I am the only one in the world like this.\" \n  \nStage 3: Identity Tolerance \nIn this \"I probably am\" stage, the person begins to contact other lgbt people to counteract \nfeelings of isolation and alienation, but merely tolerates rather than fully accepts a gay or \nlesbian identity. The feeling of not belonging with heterosexuals becomes stronger. \n \nPositive contacts can have the effect of making other gay and lesbian people appear more \nsignificant and more positive to the person at this stage, leading to a more favorable sense \nof self and a greater commitment to a homosexual self-identity. \n \nStage 4: \"Identity Acceptance\" \nThere is continued and increased contact with other gay and/or lesbian people in this \nstage, where friendships start to form. The individual thus evaluates other lesbian and gay \npeople more positively and accepts rather than merely tolerates a lesbian or gay self-\nimage. The earlier questions of \"Who am I?\" and \"Where do I belong?\" have been \nanswered. \n \nCoping strategies for handling incongruity at this stage include continuing to pass as \nheterosexual, and limiting contacts with heterosexuals who threaten to increase \nincongruity (e.g. some family members and/or peers). The person can also selectively \ndisclose a homosexual identity to significant heterosexuals. \n \nStage 5: \"Identity Pride\" \nThis is the \"These are my people\" stage where the individual develops an awareness of \n191 \nthe enormous incongruity that exists between the person's increasingly positive concept \nof self as lesbian or gay and an awareness of society's rejection of this orientation. The \nperson feels anger at heterosexuals and devalues many of their institutions (e.g. marriage, \ngender-role structures, etc.) The person discloses her or his identity to more and more \npeople and wishes to be immersed in the gay or lesbian subculture consuming its \nliterature, art, and other forms of culture.  For some at this stage, the combination of \nanger and pride energizes the person into action against perceived homophobia producing \nan \"activist.\" \n \nStage 6: \"Identity Synthesis\" \nThe intense anger at heterosexuals – the \"them and us\" attitude that may be evident in \nstage 5 – softens at this stage to reflect a recognition that some heterosexuals are \nsupportive and can be trusted. However, those who are not supportive are further \ndevalued. There remains some anger at the ways that lesbians and gays are treated in this \nsociety, but this is less intense. The person retains a deep sense of pride but now comes to \nperceive less of a dichotomy between the heterosexual and gay and lesbian communities. \nA lesbian or gay identity becomes an integral and integrated aspect of the individual's \ncomplete personality structure. \n \nAdapted from Ritter, K.

New York: Guilford Press. \n \n \nMcCarn and Fassinger’s Gay and Lesbian Development Model (1996) \nIn the McCarn-Fassinger model, the individual identity and group membership phases of \nidentity acquisition are separate processes, but each includes the same four steps: \nStage 1: “Awareness” \nThe individual begins to acknowledge people with different sexual orientations. \nStage 2: “Exploration” \nThe individual begins to explore relationship with the homosexual community. \n \nStage 3: “Deepening/Commitment” \nThe individual begins to accept a homosexual identity and recognizes the negative \nfeedback this acceptance will garner from others. \n \nStage 4: “Internalization” \nThe individual begins to understand their identity in the context of being a minority \nwithin a dominant culture. \n \nAdapted from McCarn, S. R., & Fassinger, R. E. (1996). Revisioning sexual minority identity formation: A \nnew model of lesbian identity and its implications for counseling and research. The Counseling \nPsychologist, 24, 508-534. \n \n192 \n \nD’Augelli’s Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Life Span Development Model (1994) \n In D’Augelli’s lifespan model, identity formation depends on three interrelated variables: \npersonal actions and subjectivities (An individual’s self-concept in relation to his or her \nsexual behaviors, feelings and thoughts), interactive intimacies (an individual’s \ninner circle’s response and interactions with partners), and sociohistoric connections \n(Society’s view, demographics of residence, and beliefs). The identity development \nprocess itself takes into account all three of these, and consists of six phases. Unlike \nprevious models, these phases are not sequential, nor do they necessarily occur one at a \ntime.  \nPhase 1: “Exiting heterosexual identity” \nThe individual begins acknowledging their feelings and thoughts are not heterosexual in \nnature. \n \nPhase 2: “Developing a personal lesbian/gay/bisexual identity status” \nThe individual provides his or her own definition of what being homosexual means. \n \nPhase 3: “Developing a lesbian/gay/bisexual social identity” \nThe individual begins reconciling their homosexual identity as it pertains to peer groups \nand social norms. \n \nPhase 4: “Becoming a lesbian/gay/bisexual offspring” \nThe individual is able to successfully attempt to communicate his or her \nhomosexual identity with parents/guardians and accept/deal with the consequences. \n \nPhase 5: “Developing a lesbian/gay/bisexual intimacy status” \nThe individual begins their journey to a meaningful, intimate relationship, using peer \ngroups and social connections as necessary to facilitating the meeting process. \n \nPhase 6: “Entering a lesbian/gay/bisexual community” \nThe individual begins to recognize the common injustices and triumphs of their \ncommunity and begins fostering broader LGB community connections. \n \nAdapted from D'Augelli, A.

When I \nwas coming out, I was fortunate to have a community of support at my university, and I \nhope that the HUES program allows me to give that same positive experience to other \nstudents.  \n     \nASU Graduate Student Mentoring Network, 2017; Updated 10/19/2017   \n \n  \n218 \nAPPENDIX K \nHUES LGBTQ+ MENTORING GOALS WORKSHEET \n  \n219 \n \n \n \n220 \n \n \n \n221 \n \n \nAPPENDIX L \nHUES MENTORING BEST PRACTICES AND TIPS  \n  \n222 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n223 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n224 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n225 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n226 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n227 \n \n \n \n \n \n228 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n229 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n230 \n \n \n \n \n \n231 \n \n  \n232 \n \nAPPENDIX M \nHUES MENTEE WELCOME EMAIL \n  \n233 \nHi Livia, \n \nThank you for your interest in participating in HUES this coming semester — after communicating \nwith both you and your prospective mentor, I’m excited about this match and think she will be able to \nmeet your mentoring needs well.  The prospective mentor I have in mind for you is Anne Kotleba \n(copied here); I encourage you to reach out this coming week to set up an initial meeting.  \n \nOnce the two of you have met and discussed mentoring goals, please complete the HUES mentoring \nagreement and ensure one of you gets it returned to me (you’ll each have a copy, too). Within the next \n24 hours, please expect to see another email from me. This is the ‘official’ HUES introduction email, \nand contains important information that includes the mentoring contract, basic program expectations, \nand further information about setting mentoring goals, and other important preliminary paperwork. \n \nIf you have any questions or concerns, please let me know! I really look forward to seeing you and \nAnne work together! \n \nBest Regards, \n \nZachary Reeves-Blurton  \nProgram Manager, Mentoring Initiatives & Professional Development Engagement  \nGraduate College  \nArizona State University  \np: 480-965-5990    \nemail: zachary.blurton@asu.edu  \n \n \n \n \n  \n234 \nAPPENDIX N \nMENTOR/MENTEE INTRODUCTION EMAIL \n  \n235 \nHi Livia and Anne,  \nWelcome to the HUES ASU LGBTQ+ mentoring program! I’m excited to have you aboard this semester. \nPlease read this email closely, as this serves as your introduction to HUES. Attached to this email are the \nfollowing documents: \n1. The HUES Mentoring Expectations form \n2. A HUES Mentoring Agreement \n3. A HUES Mentoring Goals worksheet \n4. The Fall 2018-Spring 2019 HUES community engagement program schedule \n5. HUES LGBTQ+ Personal Resilience Assessment description form \n6. The Graduate College’s GradConnect mentoring best practice tip sheets \nMentee next steps: now that you have been matched and introduced, it is up to you to arrange your first \nmeeting. I am asking all new mentees to complete the HUES LGBTQ+ Personal Resilience Assessment \nSurvey here. This should take no more than a few minutes, but please consider your answers. More \ninformation about this survey and why/how we use it are included in the attached Resilience Assessment \ndocument.  \nA quick note on your HUES Participant Identifier: an important part of the HUES program is the \ncreation of brave spaces for honest and intentional discussion and community engagement. At the same \ntime, we respect the privacy of all participants. To that end, rather than your name, you’ll notice that you \nare prompted to create a Participant Identifier for the Personal Resilience Assessment Survey. Only you \nwill know this identifier. To keep things simple and easy to remember, your identifier/username should be \na six-digit combo: the FIRST three letters of your mother’s name followed by the LAST three numbers of \nyour phone number. \nMentor next steps: because most HUES mentors have previous mentoring experience and mentoring is a \nhighly personalized process, HUES does not provide a structured mentor training. The attached materials \nare provided for your use as needed; if you have specific questions or concerns about initiating or \nmaintaining your mentoring relationship at any point, please feel free to chat with me at any time – I have \nseveral mentoring resources that I can share. \nFor your first meeting: the two of you should review and sign a copy of the HUES Mentoring \nAgreement, then turn in the signed agreement to me, with each of you receiving a copy for your own \nrecord. During this first session, you should also discuss your mentoring needs and goals; the attached \nMentoring Goals Worksheet might help you determine these. \nOnce the two of you have met, please touch base with me to let me know if you have any questions, \nconcerns, or feedback. This mentoring program is new, and it’s quite important to me that we be able to \nprovide the best support to our participants and mentors that we can. I look forward to your participation! \n \nBest Regards, \n \n \nZachary Reeves-Blurton  \nProgram Manager, Mentoring Initiatives & Professional Development Engagement  \nGraduate College  \nArizona State University  \np: 480-965-5990    \nemail: zachary.blurton@asu.edu  \n236 \n \nAPPENDIX O \nHUES FALL 2018/SPRING 2019 PROGRAMMING \n  \n237 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n238 \n \n \n  \n239 \nAPPENDIX P \nMENTORING LIFE CYCLE MODEL  \n  \n240 \n \n \n \nLife Cycle of a Mentoring Relationship  \n \nMentorship is a relationship marked by growth, development and change, and can be broken \ndown into four stages. In the initiation phase, mentor and mentee bond, establish rapport and \ntrust, and define their mutual expectations and goals. During this stage, it is important that mentor \nand mentee are transparent and communicative, and that mentoring goals and expectations be \ndiscussed. The initiation stage is brief, but sets the framework for the remainder of the mentoring \nrelationship. \nIn the cultivation stage, mentor and \nmentee strengthen and enrich the \ndeveloping relationship. Rapport and \ntrust are reinforced through action on \nthe parts of both mentor and mentee. \nAs expectations become clarified and \nestablished, mentor and mentee \nintentionally execute plans to \naccomplish the goals. During this \nstage, the mentor provides advice \nand guidance, supporting the mentee \nas the mentee takes action to move \ntowards established goals.  \nDuring the maturation stage, mentor \nand mentee develop an interpersonal \nsynergy as the mentee gradually \ndevelops independence and agency \nas they meet mentoring goals. As \ngoals are met, mentee and mentee \nmay evaluate the outcomes of the \nmentoring partnership, establishing new goals or concluding the formal mentorship.  \nIndependence and redefinition is the final stage in the mentoring cycle. At this time, mentor and \nmentee develop a new relationship as colleagues or equal peers, with the mentor facilitating the \nmentee’s entrance into new communities of practice or identity. During this stage, which may \ncontinue indefinitely upon accomplishment of mentoring goals, both mentor and mentee may take \non new mentees, connecting and expanding their mentoring networks. \nThe GradConnect Mentoring Network provides resources and support to mentors and mentees \nthroughout the mentoring relationship cycle, from initiation through cultivation, maturation and \nindependence and redefinition.  \n4-stage mentoring cycle adapted from American Psychological Association, Boise State \nUniversity Shared Mentoring Program, and Plymouth University. Adapted by Z. Reeves-Blurton, \nArizona State University, February 2019. \n \n \n241 \n \nAPPENDIX Q \nHUES LGBTQ+ MENTORING EXPECTATIONS \n  \n242 \nHUES LGBTQ+ Mentoring Expectations  \n \nThe HUES LGBTQ+ mentoring program is designed to bolster community engagement  and \nprovide identity-development and engagement opportunities to ASU’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQ+) communities. HUES is open to any LGBTQ+ ASU \nstudent. One-to-one peer mentoring and a reflective community blog project, augmented by \npersonal development and social engagement programming, offers a platform for students to \nembrace and discuss the roles of identity in the university and society, seek out peers with shared \nidentities and cultures, and explore the intersections of identity, expression, community, and \nbelonging within the contexts of both ASU and the larger world.   \n \nParticipant Eligibility. Any current or incoming ASU student is eligible to apply to the HUES \nprogram. \n \nMentor matching. Mentors in the HUES program are LGBTQ+ faculty, staff, and previous-year \nHUES mentees. All mentors and mentees have been asked to provide information on their \npersonal backgrounds, mentoring needs or interests, and program expectations. Matches are made \nbased on these criteria. HUES hopes that the mentoring process is a rewarding and enriching \nexperience for both mentors and mentees, and that both parties are comfortable with the match \nthat has been provided. Upon completion of the first mentoring meeting, in the event that either \nthe mentor or mentee do not feel comfortable with their match, the HUES program will offer a re-\nmatch.  \n \nStructure. The HUES program follows a fall-spring academic calendar, with new mentor/mentee \nmatches assigned beginning in August and structured programming ending in April; though \napplicants may be matched any time during the semester, any applications received after April 1 \nwill be held until the following August. \n \nOne-to-one mentoring. Participants are expected to meet with their mentor at least once per \nmonth. In the first meeting, mentor and mentee will establish goals for the semester and complete \na mentoring agreement. Subsequent meetings will be determined by mentor and mentee, using the \ngoals determined in the mentoring agreement to drive conversation. \n \nLGBTQ+ personal resilience inventory. Upon entry to the program, all mentees are required to \ncomplete the LGBTQ+ personal resilience inventory. This brief survey is designed to measure \nparticipants’ own perceived levels of community and personal support in relation to their \nLGBTQ+ identity, and is administered at program intake and exit. While individual records are \nconfidential, data collected from these assessments will drive subsequent HUES programming. \n \nCommunity enrichment programming. Enrichment programs are designed to facilitate further \nexamination and conversation around themes of LGBTQ+ community and cultural capital, \nnavigation of identity and environment, and common experiences that define the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. Participants are expected to attend at least two community enrichment programs per \nsemester. \n \nPotential trigger warning. Due to the nature of mentoring conversations around identity \ndevelopment, engagement and support, some participants may experience some emotional \ndistress or triggering in recalling and reflecting upon unpleasant or frustrating experiences.  \n \n243 \nThough challenging subjects may be a component of mentoring sessions, if agreed upon mutually \nby mentor and mentee, mentors are not trained psychologists, and mentoring sessions must not be \nused as informal counseling sessions.

    "abstract": "abstract: The college years are crucial to formation and integration of lifelong psychosocial, personal and cognitive identities, and the identity development needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+ or gender and/or sexual minority) students are unique, particularly in the context of student development and support. How universities meet these needs can critically impact success and retention of these students. However, studies indicate when the academic and co-curricular environment does not foster development of healthy LGBTQ+ identities, these students experience myriad challenges compounded by identity discord and minority stress. Cumulatively, these factors contribute to non-persistence of over 30% of LGBTQ+ university students. This research study examines the ways positive LGBTQ+ identity development, cultural capital accrual and community engagement through a structured mentoring program fosters resilience and buffers the experience of minority stress and associated negative outcomes for these students. In doing so, the study addresses the following research questions: what does the process of LGBTQ+ identity construction look like for gender- and sexual-minority students, including students from non-dominant cultural backgrounds for whom LGBTQ+ identity is one of multiple competing identities, and how does mentorship affect the perceived identities of these students? How does participation in an LGBTQ+ mentoring program affect participants’ perceptions of development of resilience-building capacity?Dissertation/ThesisDoctoral Dissertation Leadership and Innovation 201",
