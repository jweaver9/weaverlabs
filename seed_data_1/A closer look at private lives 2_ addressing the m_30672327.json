The research and writing of both reports were funded by beyondblue and the Movember \nFoundation. The project was jointly managed by GLHV and ARCSHS, La Trobe University. \nBackground \nThe first Private Lives was released in 2006 and at the time was one of the largest reports on \nLGBT health and wellbeing anywhere in the world. Both the first and second reports provided \na snapshot of LGBT Australian’s everyday lives. They included demographic data on diversity \nwithin LGBT communities and data on LGBT Australian’s physical and mental health, health \nservice use, relationships, experiences of discrimination and community connections.  \nThis companion report, in contrast, focuses on the mental health and wellbeing of LGBT \nAustralians. It relies on the mental health data from Private Lives 2 and looks, in detail, at \nvariations in psychological distress and resilience between LGBT and mainstream communities \nand variations within LGBT communities according to gender identity, sexual identity, age and \nsocio-economic status. It also looks at the relationships between LGBT Australians mental \nwellbeing and their experiences of heterosexist discrimination, drug use, LGBT and mainstream \ncommunity engagement, and health service use.  \nThe report concludes with an evidence-based LGBT mental health policy and program \nframework to guide the development of policies, programs and services aimed at promoting \nLGBT Australians’ positive mental health and their access to quality care.  \nMethodology \nPrivate Lives 2 reported on the findings of a national, online survey of the lives of 3,835 LGBT \nAustralians. Respondents came from all states and territories and from rural, regional and \nremote areas.  \nThe companion report used two of the validated scales from Private Lives 2 as measures of \nmental health outcomes: the K10 Psychological Distress Scale; and the Brief Resilience Scale. \nThe development of the LGBT mental health policy and program framework involved a review \nof recent Australian population and health promotion strategies and a separate review of the \nresearch and grey literature on LGBT-inclusive service provision in Australia and overseas.   \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 1 \n Executive Summary \nKey Findings \nPsychological distress, resilience, and diagnosis and treatment across the lifespan \n Mental health appeared to improve with age for most of the gender identity and sexual\nidentity groups. For example, rates of psychological distress decreased with age among all\nsexual identity groups. However, among bisexual females there was less variation in levels\nof psychological distress across the age groups.\n Psychological distress decreased with age among trans females, but for trans males\nremained consistently high across all age groups.\n Resilience increased with age among all gender identity and sexual identity groups.\nHowever, there was less variation in resilience according to age among bisexual females\nwhose resilience remains relatively low for all age groups.\n In late adolescence and early adulthood (16 – 24 years) rates of diagnosis or treatment for a\nmental disorder were considerably higher among lesbian females (47.1%) than gay males\n(29.5%). However, by late adulthood (60 – 89 years) the order was reversed with gay males\nreporting higher rates of diagnosis or treatment than lesbian females (22.5% vs 14.9%).\nThe impact of socio-economic disadvantage \n Lower socio-economic status was a strong indicator of mental health problems among\nLGBT respondents.\n For all gender identity and sexual identity groups, respondents who were unemployed had\nhigher rates of psychological distress and lower rates of resilience than those who were\ncurrently working.\n Trans males and trans females fared worse on a number of socio-economic indicators,\nincluding education and income, than nearly all the other gender identity and sexual\nidentity groups. This suggests that socio-economic disadvantage may be a key driver of\nhigher rates of psychological distress and reduced resilience among trans males and trans\nfemales.\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 2 \n Executive Summary \nThe impact of heterosexist harassment and abuse \n A large percentage of Private Lives 2 respondents reported having been subjected to an\nincident of harassment or abuse based on their gender identity or sexual identity in the\npast 12 months.\n Trans males and trans females reported the highest levels of abuse (55.3% and 49.2%\nrespectively) and bisexual females the lowest (30.9%). However, there was little variation\nin rates of heterosexist harassment or abuse by sexual identity, with gay males (35.1%)\nreporting only slightly higher rates than the other sexual identity groups.\n The experience of heterosexist harassment or abuse was an indicator of poorer mental\nhealth. Respondents who reported having experienced one or more incidents of\nheterosexist harassment or abuse in the past 12 months had higher levels of psychological\ndistress than those who reported no such incidents in the same period.\nDrug use and mental health \n Rates of drug use were considerably higher among LGBT people than the general\npopulation with the exception of heroin.\n Illicit drug use was an indicator of poorer mental health for Private Lives 2 respondents.\n Trans males reported the highest rates of cannabis use (38.3%) followed by bisexual\nfemales (30.6%). Those who had used cannabis reported higher psychological distress than\nnon-users for all gender identity and sexual identity groups, with the exception of bisexual\nmales.\n While gay males and lesbian females reported similar levels of cannabis use (23.8% and\n21.2% respectively), gay males reported much higher rates of party drug use (20.2% and\n9.6% respectively).1\n Among gay males, lesbian females and bisexual males, those who had used party drugs\nreported higher psychological distress than those who hadn’t.\n1 Which in this report includes Ecstasy, Meth/amphetamine, Cocaine, Ketamine and GHB. \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 3 \n Executive Summary \nLGBT and mainstream community engagement and resilience \n For trans males, trans females, lesbians females and bisexual females, participation in\nLGBT community events was associated with increased resilience. This was not the case for\nbisexual males and gay males.\n Participation in mainstream (non-LGBT specific) community events was associated with\nincreased resilience for all sexual and gender identity groups.\nUse of mental health services \n Rates of mental health service use were highest among trans females (67.2%) and trans\nmales (59.6%).\n Rates of mental health service use varied significantly according to sexual identity, with\nbisexual females reporting the highest rate (52.5%) and gay males the lowest (29.4%).\n Rates of psychological distress were higher among respondents who reported having used\na mental health service recently compared with those who reported no recent use of\nservices.\nLGBT Mental Health Policy and Program Framework \nThe report concludes with a detailed LGBT mental health policy and program framework \naimed at improving the mental health and wellbeing of LGBT Australians. The framework is \nevidence-based, informed by best practice health promotion, and reflects a commitment to \nthe principles of justice, equity and diversity.  \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 4 \nIntroduction \nIntroduction \nTwo-thirds of earth's surface is ocean, and all we can see with the naked eye \nis the surface: the skin.2 \nIt has been difficult to make strong, life-long friendships when you hold back \nbeing open…(Lesbian female 38 yrs, PL2) \nUntil quite recently, many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Australians have not \nbeen made welcome or felt at home, an experience of alienation and unbelonging they share \nwith members of other minority and marginal populations. In a world where heterosexuality \nand cisgender3 are privileged, those whose gender identity or sexual identity departs from \nthese norms are subject to varying types and degrees of discrimination and abuse (Grant et al, \n2010; Hillier et al., 2010; Leonard et al., 2008; Lyons et al., 2013c; Berman and Robinson, \n2010). \nPrivate lives 2 (PL2), the second national survey of the health and wellbeing of LGBT \nAustralians (Leonard et al., 2012), is part of a growing and compelling body of research \ndocumenting the effects of heterosexist discrimination on the health and wellbeing of gender \nidentity and sexual identity minorities (Logie and Gadalla, 2009; Lyons et al., 2014; Lyons et al., \n2013b; UNAIDS 2007; Conron et al, 2010; Corboz et al., 2008; Couch et al., 2007; Dodds et al. \n2005; Leonard and Metcalf, 2014; Leonard et al. 2012; Robinson et al., 2014; Rosenstreich, \n2011). The research demonstrates how heterosexist discrimination leads to social isolation and \nalienation, which, in turn, are drivers of reduced health and wellbeing among LGBT people \ncompared with the population at large. One of the most confronting findings of PL2 was that \nwhile the general health of LGBT Australians has improved since the first Private lives report \nwas released in 2006, their risk of mental health problems has remained the same (Leonard \nand Metcalf, 2014, p.6; Leonard et al., 2012, p.vii; Pitts et al., 2006). LGBT Australians continue \nto self-report rates of depression, anxiety and psychological distress that are much higher than \nthe national averages and these rates have not changed since 2006. \nThis report takes a closer look at the mental health data from PL2.  It explores the relationships \nbetween increased risk of depression and psychological distress among this population and a \nnumber of demographic and psychosocial variables including: gender identity and sexual \nidentity; age; and socio-economic status (education, employment and income). It also looks \n2 Haruki Murakami (2011) The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle trans. Jay Rubin, New York: Random House  \n3 Cisgender refers to people whose gender conforms to the sex they were assigned at birth. Cisgenderism refers to a \nbelief that such conformity is normal or natural and that those whose gender does not match the sex they were \nassigned at birth are unnatural and a threat to society (Blumer, Ansara and Watson, 2013; Preciado, 2013).\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 5 \nIntroduction \nmore closely at the relationships between LGBT Australians’ mental health and their \nexperiences of heterosexist discrimination and abuse, drug use, community engagement (both \nLGBT and mainstream) and health service use.  At the same time, the report identifies some \nkey indicators of resilience among this population and assesses how building LGBT people’s \nsense of belonging and social connection and value can offset the effects of systemic \ndiscrimination and abuse.  \nThe report aims to inform the development of policies, programs and services that address the \nhealth of LGBT people, and in particular their mental well-being, and ensure their access to \ntimely, appropriate and effective health care. This includes specialist LGBT programs and \nservices and the development of LGBT-inclusive mainstream services that address the needs of \nthis population as part of their core business. It also includes broader social, political and \nlegislative reforms that tackle the underlying determinants of reduced mental health and well-\nbeing amongst this diverse population.  \nThis report, however, pushes beyond the limits of current LGBT policy frameworks and \ndebates. Recent US studies show improvements in the mental health of LGBT people in those \nstates where same-sex marriage was first legalised in the early 2000s, regardless of whether \nindividuals were partnered or had exercised their right to marry (Wight et al., 2013;  \nHatzenbuehler et al., 2010). The comparative mental health data from PL2 raise the question \nof why the mental health of LGBT people continues to lag far behind that of the general \npopulation despite improvements in LGBT people’s general health and more than a decade of \nstate and Commonwealth reforms tackling heterosexism and its effects. Perhaps these two \nexamples point to the difference between tolerating and affirming LGBT people (Leonard and \nMetcalf, 2014, p.6).  As Raymond Gaita argues, it is possible to object to discrimination against \nLGBT people while nonetheless continuing to feel uncomfortable with their gender identities \nand sexual identities (Leonard, 2013, p.10).  In the absence of overt and public affirmation of \nLGBT Australians lives and relationships, many will struggle to achieve that sense of personal \nand collective worth on which good mental health and wellbeing depend.  \nbeyondblue’s engagement with the LGBT community over the past 5 years has followed a \nsimilar trajectory to the one proposed in this report. In seeking to address the high rates of \nmental health problems among LGBT people and other minority and marginal populations, \nbeyondblue has shifted its attention from the individual determinants to the social \ndeterminants of mental health. It has implemented population-based interventions that \naddress the causes and effects of deeply ingrained prejudice and systemic discrimination \nagainst LGBT people4. At the same time, beyondblue, like Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria \n4 See beyondblue’s Stop.Think.Respect campaigns. The first  campaign was directed at prejudice against LGBT \npeople, the second, at prejudice against Aboriginal Australians (www.beyondblue.org.au/resources/for-me/stop-\nthink-respect-home/is-it-ok-to-be-left-handed- and www.beyondblue.org.au/resources/for-me/stop-think-respect-\nhome/the-invisible-discriminator) \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 \n6 \nIntroduction \n(GLHV) and a growing number of organisations, has begun to push beyond a singular focus on \ndiscrimination and its effects. They are beginning to explore new models based on wellness \nthat value LGBT people and their lives independent of their experiences of discrimination and \nabuse. This is perhaps the challenge that now confronts all of us who share a commitment to \nimproving LGBT Australian’s everyday lives: how to affirm the dignity and value of LGBT \npeople’s gender identities and sexual identities, while addressing a history of heterosexist \ndiscrimination and its continued impact on their mental health and wellbeing (Leonard and \nMetcalf, 2014, p.6).  \nBackground \nThe majority of LGBT population surveys have focused on a single health issue or \nsubpopulation within the LGBT community. PL2, however, gathers information on different \naspects of LGBT Australians’ lives, providing data on LGBT people as a whole and on different \nsubpopulations within LGBT communities (Leonard et al., 2012, p.3). These include \ndemographic data, health and lifestyle factors, LGBT Australian’s experiences of discrimination, \nand their degree of community connectedness and belonging.  \nThe survey is one of the largest of its kind conducted anywhere in the world with 3,835 \nrespondents. The large sample enables meaningful comparisons to be made not only between \nthe health and well-being of LGBT people and the population as a whole but also between \ndifferent groups within LGBT communities according to differences in gender identity, sexual \nidentity, age and socio-economic status (among others). \nRationale and objectives \nThis report looks more closely at the mental health data from Private Lives 2. It functions as a \ncompanion to the 2012 report and aims to: \n Compare the mental health of LGBT and mainstream communities\n Enable a better understanding of the social determinants of higher rates of depression and\npsychological distress among LGBT compared with mainstream communities\n Look at variations in psychological distress and resilience within the LGBT community\naccording to differences in gender identity and sexual identity and how these are affected\nby differences in age, socio-economic status, and other demographics\n Look at variations in psychological distress and resilience among different groups within\nthe LGBT community according to their experiences of heterosexist discrimination and\nabuse, drug use, community engagement (both LGBT and mainstream) and health service\nuse; and\n Assist in the ongoing development of evidence-based LGBT mental health policy, programs\nand services in the government, community, health and academic sectors.\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 7 \nMethod \nMethod \nParticipant recruitment and survey administration \nThe PL2 survey was publicised through LGBT community networks and social media including \nFacebook, Twitter and YouTube. Hard copies were distributed to LGBT seniors’ organisations in \norder to increase the number and percentage of respondents aged 55 years and above. The \nonline survey was hosted by www.demographix.com and data was collected between 12 \nJanuary and the 31 April 2011.  \nEthics approval for the survey was granted by the La Trobe University Human Research Ethics \nCommittee (Reference No. 10-063).  \nThe survey’s method, design and administration are described in more detail in the original \nreport www.glhv.org.au/files/PrivateLives2Report.pdf (Leonard et al., 2012). \nSurvey content \nThe PL2 survey consisted of both quantitative and qualitative questions assessing a range of \nindividual demographics, health and lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. The \nquestionnaire also included several validated and widely used scales to assess physical and \nmental health outcomes.  \nData analysis \nIdentity categories – gender identity and sexual identity \nThe PL2 data was analysed according to gender identity and sexual identity, producing two \ndata sets. This companion report uses these two data sets, analysing variations in mental \nhealth according to gender identity and sexual identity separately. \nWhen cut according to gender identity, the total PL2 sample (N=3,835) was divided into five \ncategories: 'females', 'males', 'trans females', 'trans males' and respondents who chose \nanother term to describe their gender identity ('other preferred'). Respondents who \nidentified as 'male' or 'female' are 'cisgender' or 'cis-male' or 'cis-female.' That is, their \ngender conforms to the sex they were assigned at birth (Blumer et al., 2013). Throughout the \nreport, cisgendered respondents are referred to as 'male' or 'female.'  \nWhen cut according to sexual identity, the sample (N=3,754) was divided into six categories: \n'lesbian females', 'bisexual females', females who chose another term to describe their \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 8 \nMethod \nsexual identity ('other females'), 'gay males', 'bisexual males' and males who chose another \nterm to describe their sexual identity ('other males').5   \nRespondents who identified as ‘other preferred’ were not included in comparative analyses. \nThis was due to the variation in types of identities provided which precluded collapsing them \ninto a single category. For gender identity this included 113 respondents and for sexual \nidentity 508 respondents (142 ‘other males’ and 366 ‘other females’). \nMental health and wellbeing indicators – K10 and Brief Resilience Scale \nThe companion report uses two of the validated scales from PL2 as measures of mental health \nand well-being. The first is the K10 Psychological Distress Scale, a ten-item scale measuring \nnon-specific psychological distress (Kessler et al., 2002). The K10 scores range from 10 to 50, \nwith a higher sore indicating a higher rate of psychological distress. The second is the Brief \nResilience Scale, a six-item scale that measures an individual’s ability to bounce back or \nrecover from stress (Smith et al., 2008). The Brief Resilience Scale ranges from 1 to 5 with a \nhigher score indicating higher resilience.6  \nKey variables – demographic and psychosocial \nThe report offers a detailed analysis of variations in levels of psychological distress and \nresilience within LGBT communities according to gender identity and sexual identity, and how \nthese are affected by differences in age and socio-economic status. It also looks at variations in \nmental health within LGBT communities according to different subpopulations’ experiences of \nheterosexist discrimination and abuse, drug use, community engagement (both LGBT and \nmainstream) and health service use. The report also examines levels of psychological distress \nand resilience between LGBT and mainstream communities. \nLiterature review \nA review was undertaken of recent Australian population health and health promotion policies \nand programs at Commonwealth, State and Territory jurisdictions (Australian Policy On Line, \nGoogle and Google Scholar, using a wide range of LGBT and policy descriptors). The review \nfocused on mental health but included women’s and men’s health, drug and alcohol policy, \nsexual health, youth policy and ageing and aged care. The review also included research and \npolicy on the development and delivery of both LGBT specialist and LGBT-inclusive mainstream \nmental health services in Australia and overseas. This review informs all aspects of this report, \nand literature is cited throughout. \n5 The reduced sample size reflects the 81 respondents who could not be placed into one of the six sexual identity \ncategories (see Leonard et al., 2012 p.4 for a fuller discussion of the use of gender identity and sexual identity \ncategories). \n6 This score range is different to that used in the first PL2 report. It has been updated so that it is the same as the \nscoring range used by test developers (Smith et al., 2008). \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 9 \nGender identity and sexual identity \nChapter 1: Gender identity and sexual \nidentity \nThere is a growing body of research showing higher rates of mental health problems among LGBT \nAustralians compared with the general population. The National Survey of Mental Health and \nWellbeing 2007 was one of the first Australian population surveys to include a question on sexual \norientation. While the survey relied on a very narrow definition of sexuality, offering respondents \nonly two options, “heterosexual” or “homosexual/bisexual”, the results did show significantly higher \nrates of anxiety, affective, and substance-use disorders among non-heterosexuals compared with \nheterosexual Australians (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008; Corboz et al., 2008). \nThe findings of PL2 are consistent with the findings of the National Survey of Mental Health and \nWellbeing, with non-heterosexuals self-reporting much higher rates of psychological distress and \npoorer general mental health than the national averages. However, PL2 included a larger number of \nsexual identity descriptors and also a set of gender identity descriptors. This allowed for \ncomparisons not only between the mental health and wellbeing of LGBT and mainstream \ncommunities, but also an analysis of variations in rates and patterns of mental health within LGBT \ncommunities. The PL2 data revealed significant differences in mental health and wellbeing between \nsame sex attracted and bisexual people, and between bisexual women and men. These findings are \nconsistent with those of US and UK studies (Dodge and Sandfort 2007; Mathy, Lehmann and Kerr \n2004). The data also highlighted higher rates of mental health problems among trans people \ncompared with cis-males and cis-females within the LGBT community and how heterosexist \ndiscrimination impacts differently on gender identity and sexual identity minorities (Leonard et al., \n2012, p.4).  \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 10 \nGender identity and sexual identity \nThe first cut: Gender identity and sexual identity \nTable 1 – A description of the PL2 sample by gender identity and sexual identity7 \nn % \nGender identity \nMale 1701 44.4 \nFemale 1852 48.3 \nTrans male8 47 1.2 \nTrans female 122 3.2 \nOther 113 3.0 \nSexual identity \nLesbian female 1314 35.0 \nBisexual female 324 8.6 \nOther female 366 9.8 \nGay male 1479 39.4 \nBisexual male 129 3.4 \nOther male 142 3.8 \nWhen the PL2 sample is cut according to gender identity, 48.3 per cent of respondents identify as \nfemale, 44.4 per cent as male, 3.2 per cent as trans female and 1.2 per cent as trans male. When the \nsample is cut according to sexual identity, 39.4 per cent of respondents identify as gay male, 35.0 \nper cent as lesbian female, 8.6 per cent as bisexual female, and 3.4 per cent as bisexual male.  \nThroughout the report, data on those who did not identify with any of the categories provided or \nwho preferred another term to describe their gender identity or sexual identity are excluded from \nanalyses. There was significant diversity and variation in the other types of identities that \nrespondents provided so it was not possible to collapse them into one category. \nSome examples of other types of gender identities included: \ntrans identifying as male and female \ntrans identifying as masculine femme androgyne \nqueer or gender queer (for me this means that I don't identify strongly with \neither of the binary genders) \nSome examples of other types of sexual identities included: \npanromantic asexual lesbian \nunstraight \npansexual - gender blind \nheteroflexible \n7 The figures and percentages differ slightly from those reported in PL2 (pp. 11 and 13). This is due to some recoding of \ndata and the reclassification of 3 respondents from ‘other’ to ‘female’ under gender identity and one respondent as \n‘bisexual male’ who had not been assigned a sexual identity in PL2.  Respondents who identified as ’other‘ for their gender \nidentity or sexual identity were excluded from analyses in this report. \n8 In some instances trans males were not included in comparative analyses due to the small number of respondents (n=47). \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 11 \nGender identity and sexual identity \nPsychological distress (K10) \nPL2 used two validated scales to measure mental health among LGBT Australians: the K10 scale \nwhich assesses an individual’s level of psychological distress and the SF36 mental health subscale \nwhich assesses an individual’s general mental health (Leonard et al., 2012, pp. 35 & 37; Andrews and \nSlade 2001; The University of Melbourne 2009). The results showed that rates and variations in \nlevels of psychological distress (K10) and general mental health (SF36) were almost identical for \nLGBT respondents as a whole and for different subpopulations within LGBT communities. Given the \nsimilarity in results between the two scales, this report relies on the K10 data from PL2 as an \nindicator of LGBT people’s overall mental health. The K10 scale ranges from 10 to 50 with a higher \nscore indicating higher levels of psychological distress and poorer mental health.  \nAccording to the PL2 data, LGBT Australians report higher rates of psychological distress than the \ngeneral population, a K10 mean of 19.6 versus the national average of 14.5 (Leonard et al., 2012, p. \n35; Slade, Grove and Burgess 2011). However, a closer look at the PL2 data reveals significant \nvariations in rates of mental health problems within LGBT communities according to gender identity \nand sexual identity.  \nFigure 1 – Mean K10 Psychological Distress scores by gender identity \n^National male (M=14.0) and female (M=15.0) average psychological distress scores in the Australian general population \n(Slade et al., 2011). \nFigure 1 presents the average K10 scores by gender identity. The horizontal lines present the \nnational averages (2007) according to sex/gender with females reporting a higher average K10 score \nthan males (15.0 versus 14.0).  All the gender identity groupings in the PL2 sample report markedly \nhigher rates of psychological distress than the national averages, with males reporting the lowest \nK10 average (18.9) and trans males and trans females equally the highest (23.2). \n18.9 19.7 \n23.2 23.2 \n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nMale Female Trans male Trans female\nK1\n0 \nPs\nyc\nho\nlo\ngi\nca\nl D\nist\nre\nss\n General population (F) \nGeneral population (M)^ \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 12 \nGender identity and sexual identity \nFigure 2 – Mean K10 Psychological Distress scores by sexual identity \n^National male (M=14.0) and female (M=15.0) average psychological distress scores in the Australian general population \n(Slade et al., 2011). \nAll sexual identity groupings report higher rates of psychological distress than the national averages, \nwith gay males reporting the lowest average K10 score (18.8) and bisexual females the highest \n(21.8). Bisexual women and bisexual men both report higher rates of psychological distress than \ntheir same-sex attracted counterparts. However, rates of psychological distress are higher among \nbisexual women (21.8) compared with bisexual men (20.5).  \nResilience (Brief Resilience Scale) \nPL2 used a single measure to assess respondent’s resilience. The Brief Resilience Scale relies on six \nquestions to assess individual’s ability to cope and bounce back from difficult or stressful events. The \nscale ranges from 1 (low resilience) to 5 (high resilience). Australian general population data were \nnot available so comparative analyses rely on the findings of a US survey (Smith et al., 2013).  \nFigure 3 – Mean resilience scores by gender identity \n^Average resilience score = 3.7.

LGBT individuals who reported higher levels of psychological distress had \nlower resilience, while those who reported lower levels of psychological distress reported higher \nresilience. These findings are consistent with the research literature, which documents an inverse \nrelationship between psychological distress and resilience (Perron et al., 2014). \nMental health diagnoses \nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2008), 45 per cent of Australians aged 16-85 years \nwould meet the criteria for a diagnosis of a mental disorder in their lifetime, while 1 in 5, or 20 per \ncent of the population, would have had a mental disorder in the past 12 months. \nTable 2 – Proportion of all PL2 respondents who had been diagnosed or treated for a mental \ndisorder in the past three years \nMental disorder % \nDepression 30.5 \nAnxiety 22.4 \nOther mental disorder (not specified) 5.8 \nAny mental disorder 37.2 \nNearly 31 per cent of LGBT respondents in PL2 reported having been diagnosed with or treated for \ndepression in the past three years, and 22.4 per cent with or for anxiety.  \nFigure 6 – Proportion of all respondents who had been diagnosed or treated for any mental \ndisorder^ in the past three years by gender identity \n^ Includes depression, anxiety and other mental disorder. \nWhen the PL2 data is cut according to gender identity, trans females report the highest rates of \ndiagnosis or treatment for a mental health problem (57.4 per cent), followed closely by trans males \n(55.3 per cent). Rates of diagnosis or treatment are considerably higher among females (41.7) \ncompared with males (29.7) in the PL2 sample.  \n29.7 \n41.7 \n55.3 57.4 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nMale Female Trans male Trans female\nPe\nrc\nen\nt \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 15 \nGender identity and sexual identity \nFigure 7 – Proportion of all respondents who had been diagnosed or treated for any mental \ndisorder^ in the past three years by sexual identity \n^ includes depression, anxiety and other mental disorders. \nWhen the PL2 data is cut according to sexual identity, bisexual females report the highest rates of \ndiagnosis or treatment for a mental health problem, followed by lesbian females. While both gay \nmales and bisexual males report lower levels of diagnosis or treatment than lesbian females and \nbisexual females respectively, bisexual males report higher levels of diagnosis or treatment than gay \nmales. \n39.1 \n50.6 \n29.8 \n34.1 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nLesbian female Bisexual female Gay male Bisexual male\nPe\nrc\nen\nt \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 \n16 \nAcross the lifespan \nChapter 2: Across the lifespan \nMuch of the research on LGBT ageing has focused on how historical changes in attitudes toward \ngender identity and sexual identity minorities have affected the mental health and wellbeing of \ndifferent generations and age cohorts of LGBT people (Cronin and King, 2010; Heaphy, 2007; \nLeonard et al., 2013; Lyons et al., 2013c). Older LGBT people have lived through a period of systemic \nand rabid heterosexism that is assumed to have had a primarily negative impact on their sense of \npersonal and social value and ability to form and maintain relationships (de Vries 2014; Cronin and \nKing, 2014; McCann et al., 2013). Young LGBT Australians, in contrast, are coming of age at a time \nwhen heterosexism is on the decline and it is assumed that they will be able to achieve the same \nlevels of mental health and wellbeing as their exclusively heterosexual and cisgender peers. \nHowever, a closer look at the data reveals a much more complex picture. Recent reviews of the \nresearch on LGBT ageing show that contrary to dominant stereotypes, the majority of studies record \npositive mental health among older LGBT people and that many older LGBT people have well \nestablished, diverse and supportive social networks (Fredriksen-Goldsen 2012, Harber, 2009; Lo \n2006; Lyons et al., 2013b). These findings are consistent with PL2 data showing improvements in \nLGBT people’s mental health as they age, with LGBT people aged 60 years and above self-reporting \nlevels of psychological distress lower than the national average (Leonard et al., 2012, p.36). What the \nPL2 data also suggest are that rates of psychological distress are highest among the youngest age \ncohort, 16-24 years. The data show that LGBT young people experience intense stress and pressure \nas they negotiate environments that are still hostile to people who are not exclusively heterosexual \nor gender normative. Furthermore, these stresses are not distributed equally among LGBT young \npeople, with bisexual young women reporting higher rates of psychological distress than lesbian \nyoung women and gay and bisexual young men.  \nThe second cut: Age \nI celebrated 22 years of being in a relationship with my life partner \n(Lesbian female 62yrs, PL2) \nRespondents ranged in age from 16 to 89 years with a mean age of 37.7 years (SD=13.3). Over 50 \nper cent of the respondents were aged between 25 and 44 years. \nTable 3 – A description of the PL2 sample by age group \nAge range n % \n16-24 year olds 680 18.6 \n25-44 year olds 1902 51.9 \n45-59 year olds 815 22.3 \n60-89 year olds 265 7.2 \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 17 \nAcross the lifespan \nThe following analyses of the age-related trends in mental health and wellbeing divide the PL2 \nsample into four age cohorts.

Whereas among trans males, rates of psychological distress were \nconsistently high across the age groups. However, figures for trans males must be interpreted with \ncaution due to small sample sizes. \nThere was a marked difference in rates of psychological distress between females and males in late \nadolescence (average K10 scores of 24.3 versus 22.1 respectively). However, this gendered \ndifference disappeared with age, with females and males reporting similar K10 scores in all \nsubsequent age cohorts. \n22.1 \n24.3 23.5 \n27.6 \n19.4 19.5 \n22.8 \n25.2 \n16.8 17.3 \n24.5 \n22.4 \n16.0 15.7 \n17.2 \n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nMale Female Trans male Trans female\nK1\n0 \nPs\nyc\nho\nlo\ngi\nca\nl D\nist\nre\nss\n \n16-24 yo 25-44 yo 45-59 yo 60-89 yo\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 \n18 \nAcross the lifespan \nFigure 9 – Mean K10 Psychological Distress scores by age group and sexual identity* \n*Figures for some age groups are excluded because of small sample sizes. \nLevels of self-reported psychological distress declined with age for all of the sexual identity \ngroupings, although the decline in age was less steep for bisexual females.

Resilience increased slightly with age among all sexual identity \ngroups, with bisexual males and lesbian females having the greatest variation. Conversely, bisexual \nfemales had the least age related variation in resilience, from 3.0 for 16-24 year olds to 3.2 for those \naged 45-59 years. This suggests that resilience remains low at all ages for bisexual females. \nMental health diagnoses by age \nFigures 12 and 13 show variations in rates of treatment and diagnoses of mental disorders in the \npast three years according to age, for gender identity and sexual identity groupings respectively.  \nFigure 12 – Proportion of respondents who had been diagnosed or treated for a mental disorder^ in \nthe past three years by age group and gender identity* \n^ Includes depression, anxiety and other mental disorder. \n* Figures for some age groups are excluded because of small sample sizes. \n3.1 3.0 \n3.3 3.1 3.3 3.2 \n3.4 3.3 3.5 3.2 \n3.5 \n3.7 3.7 3.6 \n2\n3\n4\n5\nLesbian female Bisexual female Gay male Bisexual male\nBr\nie\nf R\nes\nili\nen\nce\n S\nca\nle\n \n16-24 yo 25-44 yo 45-59 yo 60-89 yo\n29.3 \n48.2 \n66.7 \n71.4 \n32.3 \n44.0 \n55.6 \n58.0 \n28.7 \n36.2 \n50.0 \n65.7 \n21.6 \n16.7 \n40.0 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nMale Female Trans male Trans female\nPe\nrc\nen\nt \n16-24 yo 25-44 yo 45-59 yo 60-89 yo\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 \n20 \nAcross the lifespan \nNearly half of the young females aged 16-24 years report having been diagnosed or treated for a \nmental disorder. This is a rate of diagnosis 1.5 times higher than that for young males. Rates of \ndiagnosis remain higher for females during early and middle adulthood. The gender difference is \nreversed in late adulthood (60 years and above) with 21.6 per cent of males reporting a diagnosis or \ntreatment compared with 16.7 per cent of females. Among female and trans male respondents, \nrates of diagnosis and treatment decrease with age. Among males, however, rates of diagnosis and \ntreatment peak at 25-44 years and then decrease with age. Among trans females, rates of diagnosis \nare highest among 16-24 year olds. Figures for trans males must be interpreted with caution due to \nsmall sample sizes. \nFigure 13 – Proportion of respondents who had been diagnosed or treated for a mental disorder^ in \nthe past three years by age group and sexual identity* \n^ Includes depression, anxiety and other mental disorder. \n* Figures for some age groups are excluded because of small sample sizes. \nWhen the data is cut according to sexual identity, rates of diagnosis or treatment for a mental \ndisorder are highest among bisexual females across the first three age categories. Rates of diagnosis \nfor bisexual females are high and vary only slightly between the three age categories, from 52.7 per \ncent in early adulthood to 47.8 per cent in mid adulthood. Rates of diagnosis are considerably higher \namong lesbian females than gay males in late adolescence and early adulthood, but by late \nadulthood, gay males have higher rates than lesbian females. \nUnfortunately, the small numbers of bisexual male and bisexual female respondents aged 60 years \nand above makes it hard to compare rates of diagnosis according to age and gender between \nbisexual and same sex attracted respondents. However, the data show significant differences in the \nimpact of ageing on diagnosis or treatment for a mental disorder between gay and bisexual males. \nWhile bisexual males report much higher rates of diagnoses in late adolescence and early adulthood \n(37.8 per cent and 42.9 per cent for bisexual males versus 29.5 per cent and 31.8 per cent for gay \nmales), this order is reversed into middle adulthood (20.8 per cent for bisexual males versus 28.9 per \ncent for gay males).\n47.1 51.9 \n29.5 \n37.8 41.9 \n52.7 \n31.8 \n42.9 \n34.3 \n47.8 \n28.9 \n20.8 \n14.9 \n22.5 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nLesbian female Bisexual female Gay male Bisexual male\nPe\nrc\nen\nt \n16-24 yo 25-44 yo 45-59 yo 60-89 yo\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 21 \nSocio-economic status \nChapter 3: Socio-economic status \nSocio-economic disadvantage is a key predictor of poor health, including increased risk of mental \nhealth problems and suicidal behaviours (ABS, 2011; Kawachi et al., 2002; Commonwealth of \nAustralia 2009; Leonard and Metcalf, 2014; McKenzie et al., 2002; Page et al., 2013; Suicide \nPrevention Australia, 2009). Key indicators of socio-economic status include level of education, \nemployment status, and income.  \nFew studies have explored the relationships between socio-economic status and the mental health \nof gender identity and sexual identity minorities. However, the studies that have been done suggest \nthat institutionalised heterosexist discrimination has a negative impact on many LGBT people’s \nsocio-economic status which, in turn, increases their risk of mental health problems. US and UK \nstudies, for example, link higher rates of mental health problems among trans and gender diverse \npeople to their experiences of transphobic discrimination (Grant et al., 2011; McNeil et al., 2012). \nAustralian data show that many transgender people leave their employment due to acute \ndiscrimination and lack of support during and after transition (Couch et al., 2007, pp.63-66). The PL2 \ndata suggest that heterosexism interacts with other forms of discrimination within and outside LGBT \ncommunities including discrimination related to age, geographic location, race, HIV status and \ndisability, placing particular LGBT subpopulations at increased risk of socio-economic marginality and \nwith that increased risk of mental health problems (Leonard et al., 2012). \nThe third cut: Socio-economic status \nAccepting that even though I identify as female I may never be able to afford \nthe cost of transitioning from male to female (Trans female 38 yrs, PL2) \nRespondents provided information on their annual income, highest level of education and current \nemployment status.  \nTable 4 – A description of the PL2 sample by highest level of education achieved \nn % \nHighest education achieved \nDid not finish secondary school 242 6.3 \nAll of secondary school 264 6.9 \nStill studying 408 10.7 \nTrade certificate 462 12.1 \nUniversity degree (undergraduate) 1110 29.1 \nUniversity degree (postgraduate) 877 22.9 \nOther qualification 467 12.2 \n52 per cent of the PL2 sample was university educated.

The percentages of trans females and trans \nmales who reported high weekly income are markedly lower than males and females respectively. \nThese trans-related differentials in income are reflected in employment rates, with trans males and \ntrans females reporting significantly lower rates of full-time employment than males and females \nrespectively (32.4 per cent of trans males and 32.8 per cent of trans females compared with 52.4 per \ncent of males and 46.3 per cent of females) (Leonard et al., 2012, p.18). \nFigure 15 – Proportion of PL2 respondents who reported high education^ and income levels^^, by \nsexual identity \n^ Including those who had completed an undergraduate or postgraduate university degree. \n^^ Income per week. \nWhen the PL2 data is cut according to sexual identity, lesbian females report the highest level of \ntertiary education and bisexual males the lowest (56.7 per cent and 36.7 per cent respectively). \nBisexual respondents, both female and male, report lower levels of university education than their \nexclusively same-sex attracted gender counterparts, 43.2 of bisexual females compared with 56.7 of \nlesbians females and 36.7 per cent of bisexual males compared with 49.3 per cent of gay males. \nThe proportion of respondents who were earning a high income was greatest among gay males (52.1 \nper cent) and lowest among bisexual females (28.3 per cent).

A large UK study and annual reports prepared by \nILGA9 and the US National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs highlight the above average rates of \nphysical violence against LGBT people (Bruce-Jones and Itaborahy, 2011; Dick, 2008; McClintock, \n2005; Patton, 2007). However, two state-based Australian studies suggest that these random and \nsometimes repeat acts of physical and sexual violence depend on, as they feed off, an everyday \nculture of heterosexist harassment and abuse (Berman and Robinson 2010; Leonard et al., 2008). \nModels that highlight acts of physical violence often fail to acknowledge or address the profound \nimpact of less visible but systemic forms of heterosexist harassment and abuse on LGBT people’s \neveryday lives and their sense of personal and collective value. \nThe PL2 data foreground current levels of heterosexist harassment and abuse and the effects of this \nabuse on LGBT people’s physical and mental health and wellbeing (Leonard et al., 2012). The data \nshow variations in rates and types of discrimination within LGBT communities according to \ndifferences in gender identity, sexual identity, and age which, in turn, lead to different rates of \nmental health problems and resilience. The PL2 data also show that LGBT people who identify with \nother minority populations or who experience other forms of marginality may be subject to the \ninteraction of heterosexism and other forms of discrimination. The compounding effects of multiple \nforms of discrimination place particular subpopulations within LGBT communities at increased risk of \nmental health problems.  \nIncidence of heterosexist harassment and abuse \nDiscovering that I could move on from my discrimination at work and get a \nbetter job in a more accepting organisation (Gay male 48 yrs, PL2) \nPL2 respondents were asked to report on whether they had experienced an incident of heterosexist \nharassment or abuse in the 12 months prior to completing the survey. They were presented with a \nlist of 14 options (including “other”) ranging from experiences of non-physical harassment and abuse \n(E.g. written threats including emails and graffiti) to acts of physical and sexual assault (E.g. physical \nattack or assault with a weapon; sexual assault) (Leonard et al., 2012, pp. 47-48). \n9 The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) is a world-wide network of national and \nlocal groups dedicated to achieving equal rights and freedoms for LGBTI people everywhere. \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 27 \nHeterosexist harassment and abuse \nFigures 20 and 21 present the proportion of respondents who indicated that they had experienced \nat least one incident of heterosexist harassment or abuse in the past 12 months according to gender \nidentity and sexual identity, respectively. \nFigure 20 – Proportion of PL2 respondents who had experienced an incident of heterosexist \nharassment or abuse, by gender identity \nTrans males reported the highest incidence of heterosexist harassment and abuse (55.3 per cent) \nfollowed by trans females (49.2) with females in the PL2 sample reporting the lowest incidence of \nabuse (33.8 per cent). Rates were markedly higher for both trans females and trans males compared \nwith females and males respectively.  \nFigure 21 – Proportion of PL2 respondents who had experienced an incident of heterosexist \nharassment or abuse, by sexual identity \nThere was little variation in the incidence of heterosexist harassment and abuse according to sexual \nidentity among PL2 respondents, ranging from 30.9 for bisexual females to 35.1 for gay males. Both \ngay males and lesbian females reported a higher incidence of abuse than their respective bisexual \ncounterparts while gay males reported a slightly higher incidence of abuse than lesbian females \n(35.1 per cent versus 34.6 per cent).  \n35.0 33.8 \n55.3 \n49.2 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMale Female Trans male Trans female\nPe\nrc\nen\nt \n34.6 30.9 35.1 31.8 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nLesbian female Bisexual female Gay male Bisexual male\nPe\nrc\nen\nt \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 28 \nHeterosexist harassment and abuse \nImpact of heterosexist harassment and abuse \nPsychological distress (K10) \nFigures 22 and 23 show the relationship between heterosexist harassment and abuse, and \npsychological distress, for gender identity and sexual identity respectively.  \nFigure 22 –Mean K10 psychological distress scores by experience of heterosexist harassment and \nabuse, by gender identity \nFigure 22 shows a relationship between incidents of heterosexist harassment and abuse and \npsychological distress for all four gender identity groupings.

This is of particular concern to \nLGBT people given Australian and international studies showing considerably higher rates of drug \nuse among this population compared with rates of use among the general population (King et al., \n2008; Leonard et al., 2012; Leonard 2008; Lyons et al., 2013a; Mayock et al. 2008).  \nBehavioural and sociological studies have identified two discrete but overlapping psychosocial \ndeterminants of increased drug use among LGBT people and communities (Halkitis et al., 2003; \nLeonard et al., 2008; McNair et al., 2014). The first is tied to LGBT individuals’ experiences of \nheterosexist discrimination; the second to the normalisation of drug use on the commercial gay \nscene. Research suggests that LGBT individuals who are particularly vulnerable to heterosexist \ndiscrimination and abuse, including LGBT young people and those affiliated with certain religious \nand cultural communities, use drugs as a way of dealing with their feelings and experiences of \nanxiety, depression and social isolation (Amadio and Chung, 2004; Brubaker et al., 2009; Green \n2003; McCabe 2010). At the same time, a growing body of research documents wide spread drug \nuse on the commercial gay scene. Here drug use is a collective activity that helps individuals ‘fit in’ \nand facilitates social and, for some, sexual interactions (Cochran and Cauce 2006; Leonard 2008).  \nHowever, these two psychosocial determinants are subject to variations within LGBT communities \naccording to gender identity and sexual identity and to the degree of LGBT community engagement \nand variations in the type and degree of heterosexist discrimination.  \nDrug use \nRespondents were asked to report on their non-medical drug use in the past 12 months. They were \ngiven a list of 14 illicit and pharmaceutical drugs, and rates of use were compared with national \naverages where data was available.  \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 32 \nDrug use \nTable 6 – Proportion of PL2 respondents who reported having used drugs for non-medical purposes \nin the last 12 months, by drug type \nDrug type PL2 \n% \nGeneral \npopulation \n%^ \nIllicit drugs (excluding pharmaceuticals) \nCannabis/marijuana 24.2 10.3 \nEcstasy 12.3 3.0 \nMeth/amphetamine 9.0 2.1 \nCocaine 7.1 2.1 \nHallucinogens 4.6 1.4 \nKetamine 2.8 0.2 \nGHB 2.3 0.1 \nKava 0.9 - \nHeroin 0.3 0.2 \nOther illicit drug 0.2 - \nAny illicit drug excluding pharmaceuticals 31.5 - \nPharmaceuticals \nPain-killers/analgesics* 20.6 3.0 \nTranquillisers/sleeping pills 12.6 1.5 \nSteroids 0.9 0.1 \nBarbiturates 1.3 - \nOther pharmaceutical 2.5 - \nAny pharmaceutical 26.7 - \nOther drugs \nAmyl Nitrate/poppers** 0.9 - \nOther drug not specified 0.3 - \n^General population estimates are extracted from the 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey report and includes \nthose aged 14 years and above (AIHW, 2011). \n*Considered to be an overestimate – it is likely that a number of respondents did not consider the disclaimer “for non-\nmedical purposes.” \n**Considered to be an underestimate (Amyl Nitrate/poppers was not included in the list of drugs in the survey) - The \nproportion above reflects the number of respondents who recorded ‘Amyl Nitrate’ under ‘other (please specify)’  \nRates of drug use among LGBT Australians were considerably higher than the national averages for \nall the drugs listed with the exception of heroin. The rate of cannabis use among LGBT Australians \nwas particularly high at 24.2 per cent, more than twice the national average (10.3 per cent). LGBT \npeople also reported markedly higher rates of party drug use, defined here as ecstasy, \nmeth/amphetamine, cocaine, ketamine and GHB. For example, the rates of meth/amphetamine and \necstasy use among LGBT Australians are over four times the national averages (9.0 per cent versus \n2.1 per cent for meth/amphetamine and 12.3 per cent versus 3.0 per cent for ecstasy). PL2 \nrespondents also report higher rates of use of pharmaceuticals than the general population.  \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 33 \nDrug use \nThe following section considers the rates of illicit drug use and the relationship between illicit drug \nuse and psychological distress among PL2 respondents according to gender identity and sexual \nidentity. Cannabis and party drugs are examined separately because the high rates of cannabis use \namong LGBT people suggest that it is being used in a much broader range of social contexts than \nparty drugs. The higher rates also suggest that cannabis is being used by both males and females in \nthe LGBT community, unlike party drug use, which research shows is much higher among gay and \nbisexual males (de Wit et al., 2013; Gay and Lesbian Medical Association 2006; Green 2003; Hickson \net al. 2007; Lyons et al., 2013a). \nCannabis use \nFigures 26 and 27 present rates of cannabis use among PL2 respondents according to gender \nidentity and sexual identity, respectively, and include the national average for comparison. \nFigure 26 – Proportion of respondents who had used cannabis for non-medical purposes in the last \n12 months, by gender identity \n^General population estimates are extracted from the 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey report and includes \nthose aged 14 years and above (AIHW, 2011). \nFigure 26 shows that rates of cannabis use were considerably higher than the national average for all \ngender identity groupings.

These data indicate the importance of social engagement and \nconnection in LGBT people’s lives, an engagement that spans LGBT community connectedness and \nfamilial association. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has identified three key protective factors against the onset \nor recurrence of mental illness: strong social networks, supportive relationships and a sense of \nbelonging (Herrman et al. eds., 2005). For LGBT people, research shows that connection and \nbelonging to LGBT and mainstream communities and to family are predictors of improved mental \nhealth (Carmen et al., 2012; Lyons et al., 2013b; Lyons et al., 2014; McLaren, 2009; Riggle et al., \n2008). A national study of same-sex attracted and gender diverse (SSASGD) young people’s health \nand wellbeing showed that acceptance by family and supportive school environments are predictors \nof a reduction in levels of self-harm and mental health problems (Hillier et al., 2010).  \nAccording to the findings of PL2, LGBT people’s access to and engagement in LGBT and mainstream \ncommunity varies according to sexual identity, age, geographic location and their experiences of \nheterosexist discrimination and abuse (Leonard et al., 2012, pp.49-54). \nParticipation in mainstream and LGBT community events \nJoining the active GLBT community has made me realise I’m not as alone as \nI once believed and people will always be there to catch me if I fall (Gay \nmale 17 yrs, PL2)  \nI saved my money so I was able to attend Mardi Gras in Sydney for the first \ntime. The experience was not only incredible it was also very inspiring and \nimportant to my self-esteem (Bisexual female 19 yrs, PL2) \nPL2 used a range of indicators of LGBT and mainstream community participation including: \norganisational membership; participation at community events; percentage of LGBT friends and \nacquaintances, and use of LGBT media (Leonard et al., 2012, pp.49 -52). In the following section \nparticipation in LGBT and mainstream community events is used as a proxy measure of community \nengagement more broadly. \nFigures 33 and 34 show the proportion of PL2 respondents who reported that they participated in \nLGBT and mainstream community events at least once annually, by gender identity and sexual \nidentity respectively.12 \n12 Respondents were asked to indicate whether they had participated in mainstream or LGBT community events arranged \nby an organisation of which they may or may not have been a member. Responses to these series of questions included: \n“Daily”, “Weekly”, “Monthly”, “Annually” or “Never.” \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 39 \nCommunity engagement \nFigure 33 – Proportion of respondents who had participated in LGBT and mainstream community \nevents, by gender identity \nParticipation in LGBT community events was highest among trans males (78.3 per cent) and lowest \namong trans females (61.5 per cent). Males and females reported a higher rate of participation in \nmainstream compared with LGBT community events but the reverse was true for trans males and \nfemales. \nFigure 34 – Proportion of respondents who had participated in LGBT and mainstream community \nevents, by sexual identity \nFigure 34 shows that rates of mainstream community participation were higher than rates of LGBT \ncommunity participation for all sexual identity groupings. Lesbian females reported the highest rates \nof mainstream and LGBT community participation (83.9 per cent and 80.3 per cent) while bisexual \nmales reported the lowest rates for both (72.4 per cent and 37.8 per cent respectively).The \ndifference between participation in mainstream and LGBT community was higher for bisexual \nfemales and bisexual males compared with their exclusively same sex attracted counterparts. The \ndifference, however, was considerably larger for bisexual males who were nearly twice as likely to \nhave attended a mainstream community event than an LGBT community event.  \n65.1 \n76.3 78.3 \n61.5 \n75.2 \n83.8 \n73.2 \n58.2 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nMale Female Trans male Trans female\nPe\nrc\nen\nt \nLGBT community events Mainstream community events\n80.3 \n62.4 68.1 \n37.8 \n83.9 78.7 75.9 72.4 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nLesbian female Bisexual female Gay male Bisexual male\nPe\nrc\nen\nt \nLGBT community events Mainstream community events\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 40 \nCommunity engagement \nParticipation in LGBT community events and psychological distress \nFigures 35 and 36 present variations in rates of psychological distress according to LGBT community \nparticipation for gender identity and sexual identity respectively. \nFigure 35 – Mean K10 Psychological Distress scores by participation in LGBT community events and \ngender identity \nRespondents who had participated in LGBT community events had lower rates of psychological \ndistress than those who had not, among all gender identity groupings.

A number of population surveys have highlighted LGBT people’s reluctance to \naccess mainstream health services because of past experiences of discrimination or because they \nanticipate such experiences in the future (Heck et al., 2006; Mayer et al., 2008; Pitts et al., 2006). \nHowever, recent studies have shown higher than average rates of health service use for particular \nsubpopulations within LGBT communities. For example, studies of women’s health suggest that \nlesbians are more likely than heterosexual women to access health care (Bakker et al., 2006; McNair \net al., 2014; McNair et al., 2011). Lesbians, however, are also more likely to report dissatisfaction \nwith the quality of care they receive and to demonstrate reduced continuity of care as a \nconsequence (McNair et al., 2014; Pennant et al., 2009; Tjepkema 2008).  \nHeterosexist discrimination can also lead to social isolation and economic disadvantage, which, in \nturn, can reduce access to health services generally and to private health care in particular. This is \ntrue for subpopulations within LGBT communities who experience high levels of heterosexist \ndiscrimination. According to PL2 data, trans females were more likely to have a regular GP (84.3 per \ncent) but less likely to have private health insurance (44.6 per cent) than other gender identity \ngroups (Leonard et al., 2012, pp.41-42).  \nU.S. studies on LGBT people’s use of mental health services show that reduced access, combined \nwith reduced quality of care, contributes to LGBT people’s sense of social marginality and exclusion. \nIn turn, this can increase their levels of anxiety and psychological distress leading to further \nreductions in their mental health and wellbeing.  \nFrequency of GP visits \nI live here for the lifestyle, work and to be close to my family but I still feel \nlike I’m suffocating…I have found a GP I feel safe with and who does not \njudge me like some that I have visited which makes me feel really good…I \ncan be honest and open about what I am up to and get regular check-ups \n(Gay male 37 yrs, PL2)  \nNearly 76 per cent of PL2 respondents (N=2,881) reported that they had a regular GP. These \nrespondents were asked how often they visited their GP in the past 12 months.13 Figures 43 and 44 \npresent frequency of GP visits according to gender identity and sexual identity, respectively.  \n13 Those who responded ‘Never’ (n=72) were excluded from analysis. \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 46 \nHealth service use \nFigure 43 – Frequency of GP visits among respondents with a regular GP, by gender identity \nThe frequency of GP visits was highest among trans females and trans males, with the majority \nreporting visiting their GP at least every 3 months (64.7 per cent of trans males and 51.0 per cent of \ntrans females). For males and females, the majority reported visiting their GPs at least every six \nmonths (51.6 per cent of males and 51.3 per cent of females).   \nFigure 44 – Frequency of GP visits among respondents with a regular GP, by sexuality identity \nFigure 44 shows similar patterns of GP attendance for all four sexual identity groupings and almost \nidentical patterns for lesbian females and gay males.

They were presented with a list of 13 service types including mental, allied and \nalternative health services (Leonard et al., 2012, pp. 42-43). \nThe following section looks at PL2 respondents’ access to mental health services and the relationship \nbetween access and psychological distress and resilience, according to gender identity and sexual \nidentity.  \nMental health services included those provided by psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors, and \nsocial workers. Rates of access to mental health services by gender and sexual identity are described \nbelow. \nGender identity \nRates of mental health service use were higher among both trans females and trans males compared \nwith males and females (67.2 per cent for trans females and 59.6 per cent for trans males compared \nwith 45.2 per cent for females and 30.1 per cent for males). The rates of mental health service use \namong transgender respondents in PL2 are higher than those reported in an earlier study of the \nhealth and wellbeing of transgender people living in Australia and New Zealand, where 47.4 per cent \nof respondents reported having used the services of a mental health professional in the 12 months \nprior to completing the survey (Couch et al., 2007). \nSexual identity \nRates of mental health service use were higher among bisexual females and bisexual males \ncompared with their exclusively same-sex attracted counterparts. Rates were highest among \nbisexual females (52.5 per cent), followed by lesbian females (42.9 per cent), bisexual males (37.2 \nper cent) and then gay males (29.4 per cent).  \nMental health service use and psychological distress \nFigures 47 and 48 look at the association between mental health service use and psychological \ndistress according to gender identity and sexual identity respectively. Respondents who reported \nhaving used the services of any mental health professional were classified under ‘Recent use of \nmental health services’. Respondents who had not used the services of any of the listed mental \nhealth specialists were classified under ‘No recent use of mental health services.’ \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 49 \nHealth service use \nFigure 47 – Mean K10 Psychological Distress scores by mental health service use and gender identity \nFor all gender identity groups, those who had recently used mental health services had higher \npsychological distress than those who had not recently used mental health services. This was \nparticularly true for trans females. \nFigure 48 – Mean K10 Psychological Distress scores by mental health service use and sexual identity \nFigure 48 shows that psychological distress was higher among those who reported recent use of \nmental health services than those who reported no recent use, for all sexual identity groupings. The \ndifference in K10 scores between no recent use and recent use of mental health services was greater \nfor bisexual males and gay males than for bisexual females and lesbian females respectively \n(differences in K10 scores of 6.2 for both bisexual and gay males compared with 4.7 and 4.8 for \nbisexual and lesbian females respectively).  \n17.1 17.7 \n19.7 \n18.3 \n23.3 \n22.1 \n25.5 25.6 \n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nMale Female Trans male Trans female\nK1\n0 \nPs\nyc\nho\nlo\ngi\nca\nl D\nist\nre\nss\n \nNo recent use of mental health services\nRecent use of mental health services\n17.0 \n19.3 \n17.0 18.2 \n21.8 \n24.0 23.2 24.4 \n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nLesbian female Bisexual female Gay male Bisexual male\nK1\n0 \nPs\nyc\nho\nlo\ngi\nca\nl D\nist\nre\nss\n \nNo recent use of mental health services\nRecent use of mental health services\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 \n50 \nHealth service use \nMental health service use and resilience \nFigures 49 and 50 show the association between mental health service use and resilience according \nto gender identity and sexual identity respectively.  \nFigure 49 – Mean resilience scores by mental health service use and gender identity \nResilience was lower among those who reported recent use of mental health services for all gender \nidentity groupings. \nFigure 50 – Mean resilience scores by mental health service use and sexual identity \nFigure 50 shows that resilience was lower among those respondents who reported recent use of \nmental health services for all sexual identity groupings.\n3.6 3.4 3.6 3.6 \n3.0 2.8 3.0 3.0 \n2\n3\n4\n5\nLesbian female Bisexual female Gay male Bisexual male\nBr\nie\nf R\nes\nili\nen\nce\n S\nca\nle\n \nNo recent use of mental health services\nRecent use of mental health services\n3.6 3.5 3.5 3.5 \n3.0 3.0 3.1 \n2.7 \n2\n3\n4\n5\nMale Female Trans male Trans female\nBr\nie\nf R\nes\nili\nen\nce\n S\nca\nle\n \nNo recent use of mental health services\nRecent use of mental health services\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 51 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nChapter 8: From private lives to public \npolicy \nA closer look at the PL2 mental health data reveals the ways in which heterosexism interacts with \nother social forces to influence LGBT people’s collective and individual health and wellbeing. These \ninteractions lead to variations in rates and patterns of mental health not only between LGBT and \nmainstream populations, but also within LGBT communities.  \nThe PL2 data show that ongoing and systemic heterosexist discrimination lead to higher rates of \npsychological distress and illicit drug use and lower levels of service satisfaction among LGBT \nAustralians compared with the population at large. A closer look at the data reveals significant \nvariations in psychological distress and resilience within LGBT communities according to gender \nidentity, sexual identity, age and socio-economic status and higher risk of mental ill-health among \nLGBT people who identify with other minority and marginal populations. A closer look also reveals \nhow processes of legislative and social reform that challenge heterosexism and promote justice and \nequity can protect LGBT people against the debilitating effects of discrimination and abuse.  \nAt the same time, a closer look hints at the limits of an approach that focuses solely on \ndiscrimination and disadvantage. It suggests the need for a new approach that values and affirms \n‘being LGBT’ as particular expressions of the diversity of gender identities and sexual identities we all \nshare.  \nIntroducing the framework \nLast Xmas my once conservative Catholic mother walked out of church \nbecause they said something against gay marriage. And she made all her \nfriends walk out too. Because she later told me, going to our wedding was \none of the best days of her life (Lesbian female 30 yrs, PL2) \nThe following sections present a policy and program framework aimed at improving the mental \nhealth and wellbeing of LGBT Australians (Figure 51). The framework is evidence-based, informed by \nbest practice health promotion and reflects a commitment to the principles of justice, equity and \ndiversity. It draws on the findings of this report and other research and policies that identify key \nsocial processes or determinants that impact on LGBT people’s health and wellbeing. The framework \nacknowledges that the same social determinants that lead to variations in rates and patterns of \nmental health both between LGBT and mainstream populations and within LGBT communities also \nhave a direct impact on LGBT Australians’ access to appropriate and effective care.  \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 \n52 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nFigure 51 – A policy and program framework for improving LGBTI Australians’ mental health and \nwell-being14 \n14 People with intersex conditions were not recruited for Private Lives 2. This was due to the difficulty in recruiting \nrespondents with an intersex condition for the first Private lives study. However, it is important that intersex and people \nwith intersex conditions are included in equality frameworks that address gender identity and sexual identity diversity.

It recognises the value of gender identity and sexual identity \ndiversity to the population as a whole while addressing the ongoing effects of heterosexist \ndiscrimination and disadvantage on LGBT Australians’ everyday lives. \nLevel 2 – LGBT Mental Health Promotion \nThe second level sits within the first and applies the principles of justice, equity and diversity to the \ndevelopment a new affirmative approach to LGBT mental health promotion (Leonard and Metcalf \n2014, p.29). This approach addresses the upstream determinants of LGBT mental health and \nwellbeing and, in particular, increased social participation and relationship building. It provides a \nblueprint for the development of policies, programs and services across a range of sectors aimed at \npromoting greater social recognition and inclusion of LGBT people and, with that, improvements in \ntheir mental health and wellbeing.   \nLevel 3 – LGBT-inclusive Mental Health Services \nThe third level nests within the preceding two. It seeks to develop LGBT-inclusive mainstream and, \nwhere appropriate, targeted mental health services. This involves developing professional practice \nand organisational procedures and protocols that affirm LGBT people and are sensitive to and able \nto address the particularities of their lives, including those practices and processes that place LGBT \npeople at increased risk of certain mental health problems. It also involves developing services that \ncan address the diversity within LGBT communities, including differences in gender identity and \nsexual identity and how these are cross-cut by other social determinants including, among others, \nage, HIV status, racial background, religious and ethnic affiliation, disability, and socio-economic \nstatus. \nUnpacking the framework \nEach of the three levels is indebted to and reflects a common set of principles - justice, equity and \ndiversity. The framework is not prescriptive; it does not tell agencies what to do. Rather, it details \ndifferent types of interventions at different levels, from legislative reform to the delivery of LGBT-\ninclusive services. The framework assists agencies and services in  identifying  where and how they \ncan implement change and how their work depends on and reinforces work being undertaken at \ndifferent levels and by other organisations. However, while individual agencies or instrumentalities \nmight focus on interventions at any one level, the overall aim of promoting positive mental health \namong LGBT Australians depends on a coordinated effort across all three.  \n1. Justice, equity and diversity\nIn Australia, efforts to secure justice and equality for LGBT people have focused on legislative and \nsocial reforms aimed at reducing, if not eliminating, heterosexist discrimination. However, the \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 54 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nfindings of PL2 hint at the limits of this approach and the need to address discrimination and abuse \nwithin a broader framework that values and affirms LGBT people’s lives and relationships. A focus on \nheterosexist discrimination has been successful in getting sexual orientation and gender identity \nincluded as protected attributes in equal opportunity and anti-discrimination legislation and as social \ndeterminants in some population health and health promotion policies (Irlam 2013; Leonard 2014, \np.346-47; Leonard and Metcalf 2014; Leonard 2005). However, as the introduction to this report \nnotes, it is possible to object to discrimination and violence against LGBT people while continuing to \nview their gender identities and sexual identities as problematic. \nWe need to move beyond policies and frameworks that construct LGBT people as little more than \nvictims, as objects of abuse. What is needed is a new approach that values gender identity and \nsexual identity diversity as social goods in their own right. Such an approach no longer takes \nheterosexuality and gender normativity as the gold standard against which other sexual identities \nand gender identities are judged and necessarily found wanting. Rather, it values different gender \nidentities and sexual identities as part of the diversity of human expression we all share.  \nThe framework developed here recognises and values diversity, and with that, the different kinds of \ndiversity that constitute the Australian population as a whole. These include, among others, racial, \nethnic and religious diversity and a diversity of gender identities and sexual identities of which LGBT \npeople are a part. Within this framework, discrimination is understood not simply or even primarily \nas a barrier to members of minority and marginal populations accessing services. Rather, \ndiscrimination also includes an unwillingness or inability to value difference and diversity and with \nthat an inability to recognise the value and dignity of minority and marginal groups. This weakens \nour collective ability to understand and value the differences that make up the society of which we \nare all part and fosters intolerance and division. For members of minority populations, including \nLGBT people, this inability leads to feelings of reduced individual and collective worth and with that \nincreased risk of mental ill-health.  \nThis framework also highlights the need for policies and programs that recognise and value minority \nand marginal groups independent of their experiences of discrimination and abuse. For LGBT \nindividuals and communities these include Government support for representative bodies and \ninclusion of LGBT issues in diversity policies and programs across the public sector, from health and \ncommunity services to school curriculum.  \nTable 7 presents possible action areas and responsibilities for promoting a culture that values and \naffirms gender identity and sexual identity diversity while at the same time addressing the impact of \nhistorical and ongoing heterosexist discrimination on LGBT people’s lives. This also involves \nacknowledging and valuing difference and diversity within LGBT communities and how other forms \nof discrimination and disadvantage can affect the lives of LGBT people who identify with other \nminority or marginal populations. While responsibility for legislative reform sits primarily with \ngovernment, policies that promote diversity and include LGBT people are the joint responsibility of \ngovernment and non-government agencies, including private companies and representative bodies \nof all stripes (E.g. PEAK bodies and ethnic and religious councils).  \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 55 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nTable 7 – Promoting a culture that values and affirms gender identity and sexual identity diversity \nJUSTICE, EQUITY AND DIVERSITY \nAffirm and value diverse gender identities and sexual identities \nAction Areas \nResponsibility \nGovernment Non-Government \nPromote diversity and LGBT inclusion \nPolicy • Include gender identity and sexual identity and\nLGBT people in:\n All diversity policies; and\n Policies addressing discrimination,\ndisadvantage and the social determinants of\nwell-being\n• Address the impact of multiple forms of\ndiscrimination and material disadvantage on\nsubpopulations within LGBT communities\n• Mandate LGBT-inclusion in all government-funded\nservices\n• Bring together representatives from different\ncommunities to discuss the value of gender\nidentity and sexual identity diversity\n• Mission statement and policies that:\n Acknowledge and value difference and\ndiversity including gender identity and\nsexual identity diversity\n Express a clear and unambiguous\ncommitment to the principles of equity,\njustice and diversity and freedom from\ndiscrimination and how they apply to LGBT\npeople\n• Head of organisation and senior staff to take a\nproactive role in profiling LGBT people and\nissues\nData collection • Inclusion of questions on minority gender\nidentities and sexual identities in:\n National population surveys; and\n Client data collection (as appropriate)\n• Collect data on the experiences of LGBT staff ,\nmembers and, where appropriate, clients, which\ncan be used to increase their social participation\nand wellbeing\nRepresentation and \nparticipation \n• LGBT representation on Government committees\nand boards\n• LGBT-specific advisory groups and structures\n• LGBT representation on boards, committees\nand working groups\n• LGBT representative group within the\norganisation to promote greater LGBT visibility\nand inclusion\nValue contribution • Publicly promote and value the unique\ncontribution of LGBT people to Australian life\n• Publicly value the contribution of LGBT people\n(E.g. organisational web sites, promotional\nmaterials, e-newsletters)\nCommunity \norganisations and \nevents \n• Inclusion of LGBT people in government-funded,\npublic events that acknowledge difference and\ndiversity\n• Increased funding and support for LGBT\ncommunity organisations and events.\n• Public events recognising key dates and issues\nfor LGBT people\n• Events that recognise and value LGBT staff and\nclients\nFreedom from heterosexist discrimination and disadvantage \nLegislative reform • Full legal recognition of gender identity and sexual\nidentity minorities including same-sex and non-\ncisgender couples\n• Full protection of all LGBT people under Equal\nOpportunity and Anti-discrimination legislation\nwithout exemption\nPublic campaigns • Work collaboratively with the LGBT community\nand, where appropriate, mainstream organisations\nto develop and deliver public campaigns that:\n Recognise and value LGBT people; and\n Challenge heterosexism\n• Where appropriate support and/or develop\npublic campaigns and resources that:\n Challenge heterosexism; and\n Recognise and value LGBT people\nResearch • Fund research aimed at:\n Promoting a culture that values diversity\n Increasing LGBT people’s visibility and social\nparticipation; and\n Combating heterosexism\nA closer look at Private Lives 2 56 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nThe following are two examples of broad-based initiatives aimed at promoting a culture that values \nand affirms gender identity and sexual identity diversity. The first is the establishment of a Victorian \nGovernment advisory body that will provide a whole-of-government response to LGBTI issues. The \nsecond is a national program that promotes greater understanding of the impact of discrimination \non LGBTI Australian’s mental health and wellbeing while affirming the value of LGBTI people’s lives \nand relationships. \n Stop.Think.Respect \nStop.Think.Respect is a national campaign run by beyondblue that challenges heterosexist \ndiscrimination and encourages LGBTI people who are at risk of or experiencing mental health \nproblems to seek help. The program includes a national ad campaign that challenges \nhomophobic behaviours and attitudes by highlighting the effects of discrimination on the lives \nand mental wellbeing of LGB people. The program also includes a suite of online resources \nconsisting of Real Life Stories from 6 LGBTI people and printed materials.  \nStop.Think.Respect was developed in consultation with LGBTI community and professional \nrepresentatives. It is the first national anti-homophobia program in Australia and the first to be \nfunded and managed by a mainstream organisation. It is part of processes of social and cultural \nchange that address the impact of heterosexist discrimination on LGBTI Australian’s lives within \na broader framework that values and affirms gender identity and sexual identity diversity.  \nwww.beyondblue.org.au/resources/for-me/gay-lesbian-bi-trans-and-intersex-glbti-people \nWhole-of-government LGBTI advisory group \nIn 2015, the Victorian Government will establish a dedicated Cabinet role for LGBTI issues that \nincludes a Premier’s whole-of-government LGBTI advisory group. The Government will also \nappoint a Commissioner for Gender and Sexuality whose responsibilities include LGBTI issues. \nThese initiatives are an acknowledgement by Government that more needs to be done to \nensure full equality for LGBTI Victorians. However, the initiatives do not focus solely on equality \nand justice. The Government has located LGBTI issues within a diversity and equity framework \nthat values and affirms LGBTI people as part of the rich network of differences that all \nVictorians share and which contribute to the vitality and health of the state. \nwww.viclabor.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Victorian-Labor-Platform-2014.pdf \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 57 \nFrom private lives to public policy \n2. LGBT mental health promotion\nThis section outlines strategies aimed at developing an LGBT mental health-promoting culture. It \nfocuses on the upstream determinants of positive mental health and in particular those that \npromote LGBT people’s increased social inclusion and participation and their capacity to form long-\nterm meaningful relationships within and outside LGBT communities. The WHO has identified a \nsense of belonging and supportive relationships and networks as protective factors against the onset \nand recurrence of mental ill-health (de Leeuw and WHO 2006). However, the framework being \nproposed here suggests that LGBT people’s relations and networks are valuable not only as \nprotective factors against increased risk of mental health problems. It is important that they are also \nvalued as social goods in their own right that contribute to the health and wellbeing of LGBT people \nand the community as a whole.  \nAffirming LGBT people as LGBT involves not only recognition of the injustice and debilitating effects \nof historical and ongoing heterosexist discrimination on their health and wellbeing. It has the added \nand profound effect of helping LGBT people gain a sense of individual and collective worth on which \ngood mental health depends. This upstream approach minimises the demand for mental health \nservices by maximising the conditions that promote positive mental health among LGBT people and \ncommunities (Leonard and Metcalf 2014, p.9).  \nThis section identifies four interrelated strategies aimed at developing an LGBT mental health \npromoting culture. They are: \n The development of an LGBT mental health promotion framework\n Cross-sector development and LGBT inclusion\n Social connection and relationship building; and\n Mental health literacy\nThe four strategies sit across a range of different sites but all depend on, as they contribute to, \nbroader social and legislative reforms that value and affirm gender identity and sexual identity \ndiversity. \n LGBT mental health promotion framework \nA comprehensive LGBT mental health promotion framework provides a blueprint for the \ndevelopment of policies, programs and services across a range of sectors aimed at promoting LGBT \nAustralians’ mental health and wellbeing. The framework applies the principles of justice, equity and \ndiversity to the lives of gender identity and sexual identity minorities. It addresses the upstream \ndeterminants of LGBT mental health and wellbeing, and in particular increased social participation \nand relationship building.  \nThe framework enables organisations beyond the health sector to understand that by developing \nand implementing policies and programs that increase LGBT people’s visibility and participation they \nare also contributing to the development of an LGBT mental health promoting culture. At the same \ntime, it provides a rationale for providing resources and developing a diverse range of programs to \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 58 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nincrease the capacity of LGBT individuals and organisations to generate and maintain relationships \nand networks within the LGBT community and between LGBT and mainstream communities. \nThe responsibility for developing and implementing such a framework lies with government in \npartnership with key LGBT and mainstream representative organisations across a range of different \nsectors. \nCross-sector development and LGBT inclusion \nDiscovering a sporting league I have become a member of. It has increased \nmy confidence and allowed me to discover myself. I also kick ass at the \nsport! (Lesbian female 30 yrs, PL2)  \nIncreased visibility and social inclusion are vital to improving the mental health and wellbeing of \nLGBT people. This involves: \n Ensuring that LGBT people are valued and active participants in all areas of social life including\nwork, education, sport and recreation, politics, art and culture\n Ensuring that initiatives promoting LGBT visibility and participation address the ways in which\ndiversity within LGBT communities impacts differentially on LGBT people’s ability to participate,\nincluding differences in gender identity and sexual identity and how these are cross-cut by other\nsocial determinants including age, HIV status, racial background, religious and ethnic affiliation,\ndisability, and socio-economic status\n Developing sector-specific strategies (E.g. sport, arts and culture, politics) to guide organisations\nin how to develop and implement policies and programs that increase the visibility and\nparticipation of LGBT people; and\n Drawing these sector-specific strategies together under a single LGBT mental health promotion\nframework that makes clear the links between increasing participation and positive mental\nhealth. These strategies are necessarily double-edged, removing the barriers that have reduced\nLGBT people’s participation while actively supporting and valuing their contribution.\nGoing upstream \nIn 2014, the National LGBTI Health Alliance released Going upstream: A framework for \npromoting the mental health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people. \nThe document presents a comprehensive framework to guide the development of policies and \nprograms that promote LGBTI people’s mental health and wellbeing and a reduction in their \nburden of mental ill-health and suicide. The document presents Australian and international \ndata on the mental health and wellbeing of LGBTI people and identifies the key determinants of \nincreased mental ill-health among this community. The framework focuses on the upstream \ndeterminants of LGBTI health and wellbeing and on creating environments that are conducive \nto positive LGBTI mental health through advocacy, legislative reform, capacity building and \ncommunity strengthening. \nhttp://lgbtihealth.org.au/sites/default/files/going-upstream-online-o-lgbti-mental-health-\npromotion-framework.pdf \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 59 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nAt the same time, there is an opportunity to use these various sectors and organisations as sites for \nthe delivery of LGBT mental health promotion, including information, resources and referrals. This \nrequires linkages and partnerships among organisations from different sectors, including \npartnerships between mental health and LGBT health and community organisations and \nrepresentative bodies from each of the sectors listed above. \nSocial connection and relationship building \nI made a huge change to move to Melbourne…it was mostly to get away from \nmy parents who made my life very difficult since coming out. I was diagnosed \nwith depression but with the help of my loving partner and friends I can see \nthe light at the end of the tunnel (Lesbian female 29 yrs, PL2) \nThere is a growing body of research showing the positive impact of social connection and \nrelationship building on people’s mental health. Social connection and meaningful relationships \nprovide that sense of belonging, value and purpose on which positive mental health depends (de \nLeeuw WHO 2006). For minority and marginal populations, including LGBT people, these networks \nand relationships may also mitigate the trauma associated with experiences of discrimination and \nabuse (VicHealth 1999).  \nEfforts to promote greater connection among LGBT people should draw on the strengths and \nresilience of LGBT communities. This involves resources and capacity building aimed at: \n Consolidating existing LGBT programs and services within and outside the health system; and\n Identifying gaps in the provision of social support to LGBT communities including increased\nfunding for vulnerable and under-resourced groups\nAt the same time, resources and programs are needed to increase LGBT people’s capacity to build \nand sustain friendships, and familial and intimate relationships. According to the findings of PL2, \nLGBT Australians rate LGBT friends most highly for emotional support. However, they are most likely \nto seek support from biological family when sick (Leonard et al., 2012 p.24). These findings \nFair go, sport! \nFair go, sport! was launched in 2010 and is run by the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human \nRights Commission (VHREOC) and funded by the Australian Sports Commission. The project \naims to promote greater awareness of sexual and gender identity within sport and safe \ninclusive sporting environments where all people can participate. The project has worked with a \nrange of sporting codes including Hockey, Basketball, Cycling, Football and Skate Victoria/Roller \nDerby.  \nIn 2012, VHREOC applied the Fair go, sport! model to sport, health and physical education \nprograms in secondary schools. The project aims to assist schools develop strategies for \npromoting inclusion in school sport and to make sport a safe and supportive environment for all \nstudents regardless of their gender or sexual identity. \nwww.humanrightscommission.vic.gov.au/index.php/fair-go-sport-home \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 60 \nFrom private lives to public policy \ndemonstrate the complex network of relationships within and outside LGBT communities that can \nhave an impact on LGBT people’s mental health and wellbeing.   \nLGBT people need open and supportive environments within and outside LGBT communities where \nthey can develop friendships and intimate relationships, particularly for vulnerable subpopulations \nsuch as SSASGD young people and people who are trans or gender diverse. Many LGBT people face \nadded pressures in negotiating familial relationships. These include: \n Fear of being rejected by other family members if they come out as out as LGB or T (this includes\nboth children and parents who are LGBT)\n The added pressures on LGBT people from religious and ethnic communities that privilege\n‘family’ and traditional gender roles\n Difficulties in maintaining familial relations for LGBT people who have come out as they\nrenegotiate their personal, public and familial identities; and\n The pressures that LGBT parents and their children experience in a world that continues to\nprivilege heteronormative and cisgendered families.\nFinally, studies from the US clearly show improvements in LGBT people’s mental health and \nwellbeing in jurisdictions that have legalised marriage equality or introduced other official processes \nfor recognising the legal status and symbolic value of same sex and non-cisgendered relationships \n(Buffie 2011; Wight 2013).  \nMental health literacy \nThere are no studies assessing the levels of mental health literacy among LGBT communities. \nHowever, a national survey revealed poor levels of literacy among the Australian population \n(Reavley and Jorm 2011). The survey found that a minority of Australians could recognise specific \nmental health disorders and that many people’s understandings of the causes and effective \ntreatment of mental disorders varied considerably from those of medical experts.  \nFor the population as a whole, an improved understanding of the causes of mental ill-health and \ntreatment options is crucial to early identification and prevention and to more timely and effective \ntreatment. However, for LGBT people this involves an understanding of how heterosexist \ndiscrimination and abuse increase their risk of particular mental disorders and how this risk may be \ngreater for LGBT people who identify with other minority and marginal populations. It also involves \nan understanding of how LGBT cultural norms and practices can be implicated in behaviours that are \nknown to impact negatively on mental health, including high levels of alcohol consumption and illicit \ndrug use, and how these vary according to gender identity and sexual identity within LGBT \ncommunities. \nAt the same time, there is a need for education and training to help LGBT people develop skills to \nidentify the warning signs of possible mental health problems, including problematic use of alcohol \nand drugs, in their lives and in the lives of their LGBT friends. This needs to be accompanied by an \nopen and ongoing discussion within LGBT and mainstream communities of the complex factors that \nlead to higher rates of mental disorders among LGBT people.  \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 61 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nAt a minimum, developing education, training and resources aimed at improving mental health \nliteracy for LGBT people should be: \n Accessible\n Evidence-based\n Relevant to LGBT people’s lives; and\n Focused on the mental health pressures specific to LGBT communities and particular\nsubpopulations within those communities.\n3. LGBT-inclusive mental health services\nA 2007 systematic review of research on counselling and psychotherapy for LGBT people in the UK \nfound that one of the major barriers to LGBT people seeking mental health care was the lack of an \naffirmative provider (King et al. 2007; Owens et al. 2007). For many LGBT people, affirmation was \nclosely linked to feeling safe and supported, and included not only being safe from abuse by staff \nand other clients but also feeling supported and valued by services and individual practitioners \n(Owens et al. 2007). Historically, this level of sensitivity and awareness was most likely to be found \namong service providers who had strong ties to LGBT communities. Until very recently, most \nmainstream services were insensitive to the pressures faced by LGBT people in their everyday lives \nand many displayed the very heterosexist biases that contributed to higher rates of mental health \nproblems among this population (Hellman & Klein, 2004).  \nHowever, in Australia over the past decade, there has been a growing expectation among LGBT \npeople and representative health bodies that mainstream health services will be LGBT-inclusive as \npart of their everyday business (Allen 2008; Royal College of Nursing 2004; Victorian Government \n2009). Recent research findings from the US show that many LGBT people are less concerned about \nthe gender identity or sexual identity of individual practitioners and more concerned that services \ncan demonstrate that they are supportive and open to LGBT people (King et al. 2007; Owens et al. \n2007).  \nThese findings suggest that a focus on LGBT-inclusive and affirmative practice undermines any \nsimple division between mainstream and LGBT-specific mental health care. All mental health care \nagencies should be able to provide services that meet the diverse needs of their clients, including \nthe delivery of culturally appropriate care to LGBT people. At the same time, LGBT specialist mental \nhealth and allied services are required where detailed knowledge and understanding of LGBT people \nand their lives are needed or where access to LGBT practitioners and LGBT-driven care is integral to \ntreatment and recovery. What is common to both types of service delivery, however, is a new \napproach that addresses the risk factors that contribute to LGBT people’s mental health and possible \nsources of resilience within a broader organisational and therapeutic culture that affirms and values \nLGBT people’s gender identities and sexual identities and their lives and relationships. \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 62 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nFigure 52 – The provision of LGBT-inclusive mental health services \nFigure 52 represents an integrated model for the development of an LGBT-inclusive mental health \nsector. The model makes a distinction between two different types of LGBT-inclusive mainstream \nservices: \n Mainstream services committed to LGBT-inclusive practice, where all of the organisation’s\npractices, procedures and protocols are non-discriminatory and LGBT-affirmative; and\n Mainstream services that have developed a dedicated program or programs to assist their LGBT\nclients. This may include services where LGBT people are overrepresented (such as mental\nhealth and drug and alcohol services) and where an understanding of the unique pressures\ndriving this overrepresentation is vital to the provision of effective care.\nThe development of an LGBT-inclusive mental health sector relies on integration and coordination \nbetween mainstream and LGBT-specialist mental health and allied services. It also depends on the \nparticipation of LGBT community organisations, professionals and consumers in the ongoing \ndevelopment of models of LGBT-inclusive practice and service delivery. Finally, mental health \nservices need to be aware of and able to respond to differences within LGBT communities. These \ninclude differences in gender identity and sexual identity, and how LGBT people who are members \nof other minority and marginal populations may be subject to added pressures associated with other \nforms of discrimination and material disadvantage. This is a flexible model of integrated LGBT-\ninclusive mental health care, able to accommodate the needs of LGBT communities and the \nparticular needs of individual LGBT clients.  \nThe following are current examples of LGBT-inclusive mainstream mental health care and LGBT \nspecialist services. However, greater efforts are needed to ensure that LGBT-inclusive practice is \nprovided as part of core business and good professional practice by all mental health and allied \nservices.  \nLGBT-inclusive mainstream practice \nIn Australia, LGBTI organisations in different states and territories have begun to provide LGBTI \ntraining to mainstream mental health care workers and services to assist them in developing LGBTI-\ninclusive practice. In Victoria, GLHV delivers a range of staff training modules on LGBTI health and \nwellbeing, including targeted modules on drug and alcohol and mental health issues. Similar training \nhas been developed and delivered by LGBTI organisations in Queensland, Western Australia and \nNSW. In 2013/14 in NSW, ACON developed the Peace of Mind program in partnership with the \nMental Health Coordinating Council (MHCC) and in collaboration with The National LGBTI Health \nLGBT-inclusive mainstream practice \nLGBT specialist services \nMainstream services with an LGBT stream \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 63 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nAlliance and GLHV. The education program assists professionals understand LGBTI mental health and \nidentity issues and helps LGBTI people experiencing mental ill-health.  \nThe National LGBTI Health Alliance delivers the MindOUT! Project, a national, Commonwealth-\nfunded, LGBTI mental health and suicide prevention project (www.lgbtihealth.org.au/mindout). The \nProject works with, and delivers a range of workshops and training to, LGBTI organisations and \nmainstream mental health providers to improve mental health and suicide prevention outcomes for \nLGBTI people and populations. As part of MindOUT!, The Alliance also hosted a national webinar \nseries that critically engaged with topics relevant to mental health and suicide prevention for LGBTI \npeople and a Champion’s Program that identifies and supports champions to promote LGBTI \ninclusive practice and culture change within their organisations.  \nMainstream services with an LGBT stream \nThere are a number of GP clinics and mental health care organisations in capital cities across \nAustralia that target LGBT people and provide a range of mental health services including counselling \nand cross referrals.  beyondblue has developed a separate LGBTI stream which includes resources \nand research targeting LGBTI consumers. beyondblue provides online tools to assist LGBTI \nconsumers assess their levels of psychological distress and develop action plans to deal with anxiety \nand depression, and information for understanding how heterosexist discrimination might be \ncontributing to their mental ill-health.  \nThe Rainbow Tick Program \nThe Rainbow Tick consists of six standards of LGBTI-inclusive practice for the health and human \nservices sectors, developed by GLHV in partnership with Quality Innovation Performance (QIP), \na national, not-for-profit accreditation organisation. In order to gain Rainbow Tick accreditation \norganisations must demonstrate that all their practices, procedures and protocols are LGBTI-\ninclusive. \nAs part of the Rainbow Tick Program, organisations can undertake LGBTI inclusivity \ntraining provided by GLHV, including the HOW2 Program. The HOW2 consists of four \nworkshops run over six months and takes organisational representatives through each of the \nsix Rainbow Tick standards. In order to demonstrate compliance with the Rainbow Tick \nstandards, organisations undertake an internal audit, followed by an independent on-site \nassessment conducted by a QIP assessment team. Organisations that gain Rainbow tick \naccreditation will be listed on a national registry of LGBTI-inclusive, rainbow ticked agencies. \nwww.glhv.org.au/glbti-inclusive-practice \nwww.qip.com.au/standards/rainbow-tick-standards/ \nCarers Victoria – Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans* and intersex (LGBTI) carers \nCarers Victoria provides advice, information and support for carers to improve their health, \nwellbeing, capacity, financial security and resilience. The organisation has worked in partnership \nwith LGBTI communities to improve services and advocacy for LGBTI carers. Carers Victoria has \ndedicated staff, resources and training to support LGBTI people in a variety of care relationships \nincluding carers who identify as LGBTI and carers of LGBTI people. The support services \nacknowledge that LGBTI people take on caring roles not only for biological family but also for \nfriends and ‘family of choice’.  \nwww.carersvictoria.org.au/how-we-help/LGTBI-carers/ \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 \n64 \nFrom private lives to public policy \nLGBT specialist services \nIn some states and territories, publicly-funded LGBTI organisations such as VAC/GMHC and ACON \noffer direct support for LGBTI people at risk of or experiencing mental ill-health.  \nQLife is a national counselling and referral service for LGBTI Australians funded as part of the \nCommonwealth Department of Health’s Teleweb project and directed by the National LGBTI Health \nAlliance. QLife provides peer-supported telephone and web-based services to LGBTI people who are \nexperiencing a range of mental health issues, including those related to their experiences of \nheterosexist discrimination. \nThe Healthy Equal Youth (HEY) Project \nThe HEY Project aims to reduce self-harm and suicide among same sex attracted and sex and \ngender diverse (SSASGD) young people in Victoria and improve their mental health and \nwellbeing. The project provides funding for seven agencies, each of which has particular \nexpertise and experience in working with and on behalf of SSASGD young people. The project \naims to build the capacity of each organisation while enabling the seven organisations to work \ncollaboratively with each other and the youth and mental health sectors to create an SSASGD \nyouth platform within the mainstream youth sector. The HEY Project also includes an annual \nfunding round that provides one-off small grants for SSASGD youth projects at the local level.  \nThe HEY Project is funded by the Victoria Government and is jointly managed by \nGLHV and the Youth Affairs Council of Victoria I(YACVic). \nwww.heyproject.org.au/ \nA closer look at Private Lives 2 65 \nReference list \nReference list \nAllen, O.

    "abstract": "Based on a national survey of almost 4000 people, the report reveals strong links between psychological distress and drug use among LGBT Australians.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nA Closer Look at Private Lives 2 is a companion to the second Private Lives report released in 2012. The research and writing of both reports were funded by beyondblue and the Movember Foundation. The project was jointly managed by GLHV and ARCSHS, La Trobe University.\n\nBackground \n\nThe first Private Lives was released in 2006 and at the time was one of the largest reports on LGBT health and wellbeing anywhere in the world. Both the first and second reports provided a snapshot of LGBT Australian’s everyday lives. They included demographic data on diversity within LGBT communities and data on LGBT Australian’s physical and mental health, health service use, relationships, experiences of discrimination and community connections.\n\nThis companion report, in contrast, focuses on the mental health and wellbeing of LGBT Australians. It relies on the mental health data from Private Lives 2 and looks, in detail, at variations in psychological distress and resilience between LGBT and mainstream communities and variations within LGBT communities according to gender identity, sexual identity, age and socio-economic status. It also looks at the relationships between LGBT Australians mental wellbeing and their experiences of heterosexist discrimination, drug use, LGBT and mainstream community engagement, and health service use.\n\nThe report concludes with an evidence-based LGBT mental health policy and program framework to guide the development of policies, programs and services aimed at promoting LGBT Australians’ positive mental health and their access to quality care.\n\nMethodology\n\nPrivate Lives 2 reported on the findings of a national, online survey of the lives of 3,835 LGBT Australians. Respondents came from all states and territories and from rural, regional and remote areas.\n\nThe companion report used two of the validated scales from Private Lives 2 as measures of mental health outcomes: the K10 Psychological Distress Scale; and the Brief Resilience Scale.\n\nThe development of the LGBT mental health policy and program framework involved a review of recent Australian population and health promotion strategies and a separate review of the research and grey literature on LGBT-inclusive service provision in Australia and overseas.\n\nRelated identifer: ISBN 978192191569",
