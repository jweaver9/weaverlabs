As science continues to establish \nlogical explanations and proof of humankind’s development, religious \ninstitutions compete to provide an explanation for divine involvement \nin human origin (Paz-y-Mino-C, 2009a; Maurer, 2009). Furthermore, as \npostsecondary and postgraduate universities that are initially sponsored \nby religious institutions become more autonomous, students and faculty \nmembers grapple between both sides of the debate (Marsden, 1994). This \ndebate resonates even more so today among Millennials in educational \ninstitutions that remain affiliated with Christian evangelical denomina-\ntions (Ladine, 2009; Jelen, 2010; The Tennessean, 2014).\nEvangelicalism is a branch of Protestant Christianity with which \nroughly 25% of Americans identify (Pew Research, 2015). Although \nwidely varied in its expressions, Evangelicalism is characterized by its \ndoctrines of scriptural infallibility, Christ’s literal and physical crucifixion \nand resurrection, a life-transforming experience of conversion, and an \nactive engagement with the rest of the world, especially through evangelism \n(Hankins, 2008, p. 1-3). Because of their more literalist interpretations \nof the Bible, Evangelicals largely associate themselves with political and \ncultural conservatism, and this includes skepticism toward notions that \nchallenge the sovereignty of a Creator. The theory of evolution is seen \nas such a notion because of its refusal to literally adhere to the six-day \ncreation narrative posited in the book of Genesis (Hankins, 2008, p. \n52; Harris, 1998, p. 1-2, 9). While some rather progressive Evangelicals \nwho are sympathetic to metaphorical interpretations of Scripture would \nclassify this attitude as “fundamentalist” rather than “Evangelical,” many \nreligious scholars agree that the line distinguishing the two terms has \nbecome blurred over time (Hankins, 2008, p. 59, 66-69; Harris, 1998, \np. 1-2, 9, 19).\nHowever, even in light of the staunch convictions of American \nEvangelicals, the Millennial generation, consisting of those born between \n1980 and 2000, is the least religious of any generation in modern \nAmerican history (Rainer, 2010). According to Rainer, only 13% of \nMillennials view religion as important, and roughly 25% identify as \natheist, agnostic, or nonreligious (2010). This surpasses Generation X \nand the Baby Boomers at their nonreligious peaks: 20% and 13%, re-\nspectively (Pew Research, 2010). Millennials should also be noted for \ntheir widespread acceptance of science. In a Pew Research study which \nsurveyed Americans’ opinions on evolution, the highest acceptance rate \nThe Young and the Religious: Acceptance \nof Evolution among Millennials at an \nEvangelical Christian University\nJed T.

The same study also shows that the \noverwhelming majority of Americans unaffiliat-\ned with any religious label accept evolution as \nfact (2013).\nFor college students, the relationship \nbetween the acceptance of evolution and reli-\ngiosity is negatively correlated (Paz-y-Mino-C, \n2013). Students are more likely to accept \nevolution as fact and less likely to adhere to \nfaith. Studies show that although most college \nstudents will support evolution, those in secular \ninstitutions constitute a greater amount of \nsupport than those from religious institutions \n(Paz-y-Mino-C, 2009a; 2013). Unfortunately, \nthe details regarding students at these insti-\ntutions are vague at best. Our knowledge of \nMillennials’ overall opinion of religion and \nscience is substantive, but regarding college \nstudents, especially those attending Christian \nuniversities, our knowledge is very limited. The \nPew Research Center has performed in-depth \nstudies of the American public’s perception of \nevolution and Millennials’ religious beliefs, \nstratifying their independent variables into \nreligious denomination, political affiliation, \nand education level (2010; 2013). Biologist \nGuillermo Paz-y-Mino-C has performed signif-\nicant studies on the correlation between biology \nand non-biology majors and their acceptance \nof evolutionary theory, also taking into account \ntheir academic year and the type of academic \ninstitution in which they are enrolled (2009b). \nBut even in the midst of such comprehensive \nstudies, virtually none have been performed on \nChristian universities and colleges using these \nin-depth methods.\nA thorough examination of students in \nChristian universities will shed some light on \ntheir acceptance of evolutionary theory and \nsupport for creationism and intelligent design. \nWhile it would be understandable to assume \nthat most students at a Christian university are \nof a conservative persuasion, the diversity can be \nsurprising. Not all students attending Christian \nuniversities should be compiled into one stereo-\ntype. There are some Christian universities that \ncompletely reject the exposition of evolution \nin classrooms, while others consider it to be \nperfectly compatible with the Christian faith \n(The Tennessean, 2014; Schuman, 2010).\nBecause of the acceptance of evolution \nwithin certain denominations of the church \ncoupled with a staggering antipathy toward \nreligion within the Millennial generation, it \nis important for us to know the extent of sec-\nularization among Millennials in Christian \nuniversities, especially those associated with con-\nservative Evangelical denominations (Martin, \n2010; Jelen, 2010; Pew Research, 2010). Thus, \nthe purpose of this paper is to test the theory \nof secularization—the idea that religious \ninfluence over society is weakening due to in-\ncreasing modernity, namely science—among \nMillennials attending an Evangelical Christian \nuniversity by measuring their support of evolu-\ntionary theory as opposed to creationist theory \n(Pickering, 1984/2009). As students’ opinions \nare measured, this study takes their backgrounds \ninto account as independent variables (e.g., \nreligious practice, institutions of secondary \neducation, academic discipline, academic year, \nand political affiliation).\nDue to Durkheim and Weber’s theory \nof secularization that suggests the dwindling \ninfluence of the church over society (Pickering, \n1984/2009; Swatos & Christiano, 1999), the \nevidence that Millennials are leaving the church \nat a substantial rate (Barna, 2011), and the fact \nthat certain major denominations of the church \nalready accept aspects of evolutionary theory \n(Jelen, 2010; Martin, 2010), we ask, “to what \nextent do Millennials in an Evangelical Christian \nuniversity accept evolutionary theory, and what \nare the variables that affect their opinions?” Our \nhypothesis is that:\n1. Students who major in hard sciences \n(biology, chemistry, etc.) are much more \nlikely to accept evolution as fact as opposed \nto non-science majors. \n2. The greater the academic level of students, \nthe more likely they are to accept evolution \nas fact. For example juniors and seniors in \ncollege are more likely to accept evolution \nthan freshmen and sophomores. \n3. College students who were previous-\nly educated in the public school system \nFoster | 91\n Papers & Publications, vol. 6\nare more likely to affirm evolution than \nthose educated in private school or were \nhomeschooled. \n4. Students who adhere to liberal political ide-\nologies and parties are more likely to accept \nevolution as fact than students who identify \nas political conservatives.\nSecularization theory\nSecularization theory, as propagated by sociolo-\ngists Durkheim and Weber, states that religion \ndiminishes as time passes and as science is better \nunderstood (Pickering, 1984/2009; Swatos \n& Christiano, 1999). The term “seculariza-\ntion” was coined by Max Weber (1930) as a \nconcept caused by “rationalization,” the ability \nto explain events within this worldly experi-\nence, and “disenchantment,” the devaluation \nof all prospects of the supernatural. Weber held \nthat “the mysterious” nature of the supernatu-\nral existed only to be conquered by science and \nhuman reason (Swatos & Christiano, 1999). \nDurkheim’s school of thought regarding secu-\nlarization purports that religion fully permeated \nsociety in the beginning, but as time passes, \nsocieties free themselves from religious domina-\ntion through both the acquirement of scientific \nknowledge and the church’s inability to suppress \nit. Religious conceptions of the general order, \nthe “sacred” of which the church has been the \nguardian, has been “profaned” by scientific reve-\nlation (Pickering, 1984/2009). Evolution will be \nseen as that which profanes the sacred concept of \ncreation, and the church cannot make evolution \ndisappear. Religious leaders do not have the same \npolitical authority as they once did during the \ntime of Galileo. Their inability to suppress sci-\nentific discovery renders their ability to protect \nthe sacred obsolete. In fact, Durkheim measured \nthe secularized state by the church’s inability to \nenforce rules relating to sacrilege. As he noted, \n“Once science came into being, it assumed a \nprofane character, especially in the eyes of the \nChristian religion; consequently as it emerged it \ncould not be applied to sacred things” (as quoted \nby Pickering, 1984/2009).\nBackground of the debate\nFor at least a generation before Charles Darwin \ncoined his infamous theory of natural selection \nin an attempt to explain how organisms evolved, \nEvangelicals were already framing ways to \nharmonize Scripture with the idea that the \nEarth was ancient (Hankins, 2008, p. 54). Many \nEvangelical scholars had little issue accepting an \nold-Earth view as well as the idea that the Earth \nhad developed slowly over a long period of time. \nAs Hankins writes, “There were ways of reading \nGenesis that were within the realm of evangel-\nical Biblicism but did not rule out an ancient \nearth and a long period of time for creation \nto take place” (p. 54). Thus, many Evangelical \nintellectuals were content with working within \nthis hermeneutical tradition. However, when \nDarwin released his 1859 magnum opus, On the \nOrigin of Species, Evangelical thinkers took issue \nwith his idea that variations in animals were \nrandom and did not appear to move toward a \ndivine telos. Darwin posited that some of the \nmost important changes in nature happened \nwithout an apparent purpose, and this subverted \nthe notion of a God-ordained design for many \nEvangelicals (Hankins, 2008, p. 59; Livingstone, \n1987, p. 39, 48-49).  \nAt the same time, responses to On the Origin \nof Species were as varied in the late-nineteenth \ncentury as they are today (Daniels, 2014, p. 438). \nFor about fifty years following Darwin’s famed \npublication, many Christian leaders were open \nto engagement with Darwinism, and authors of \nthe Church of England’s Lux Mundi intended to \nexamine traditional Christian doctrine through \na hermeneutic sympathetic to Darwin’s claims \n(Daniels, 2014, p. 439). Hankins mentions that \n“a minority of Evangelical thinkers opposed \nevolution in any form, others accepted evolution \nwhile rejecting Darwin’s interpretation, and still \nothers went a good distance toward accepting a \nslightly adjusted form of Darwinism” (Hankins, \n2008, p. 59). Many of the Evangelicals who \nremained hostile to Darwin’s ideas viewed \nScripture through a literal, fundamentalist lens, \nand opposition to Darwinism and evolutionary \ntheory as a whole became a powerful political \npoint for American fundamentalists. In 1919, \nthe notorious three-time Presidential candidate \nand populist politician William Jennings \nBryan adopted and widely publicized the \n92 | Foster\nThe Young and the Religious\nantievolutionist cause, and his fundamentalist \ncrusade against Darwinism spread throughout \nthe southern United States (Hankins, 2008, p. \n60; Harris, 1998, p. 32).\nFor many of these fundamentalists, \nevolution was a symbol of atheistic modernism. \nAs fundamentalist intellectuals attacked \nevolution within denominations and seminaries, \npopular fundamentalists such as Bryan attacked \nthe teaching of evolution in America’s public \nschools. Bryan and his fellow crusaders held that \nDarwinism would brainwash America’s youth \nand destroy American culture. They believed \nthat Germany’s downfall in World War I was as-\nsociated with the rise of theological modernism \nand evolutionary science. Thus, in order for the \nUnited States to avoid a similar fate, it would \nhave to purge itself from any and all adherence \nto modernist thought, including evolutionary \nscience (Hankins, 2008, p. 59). Bryan held \nthat teaching evolution in public schools would \nproduce a new generation of atheists devoid of all \nmorality. For him, the truth of evolution would \nassert that human beings were simply advanced \nanimals without a standard by which they could \nbe held accountable for their actions. Regarding \nDarwinism itself, he noted, “Darwinism is not \nscience at all; it is guesses strung together” (as \nquoted by Hankins, 2008, p. 61).  \nThe battle of American fundamentalism \nnotably culminated with the Scopes trial of \n1925 (Maurer, 2009, p. 64). As a result of the \naforementioned antievolution crusades, several \nAmerican states considered passing antievolu-\ntion bills in their legislatures. Tennessee passed \none of the first such bills, the Butler Act, in \n1925. Following this new legislative action, \nJohn Scopes, a science teacher based out of \nDayton, Tennessee, was arrested for teaching \nevolution. Bryan, who pushed for the passage \nof these antievolution bills, soon joined the \nprosecutorial team, and Clarence Darrow, a \nfamed trial lawyer, came to Scopes’ defense. \nThe trial was an instant media spectacle as \njournalists and proponents of both sides of the \ndebate flocked to Dayton to witness the ordeal \n(Harris, 1998, p. 33-34). Although Scopes was \neventually found guilty and fined, the process \nproved to be an embarrassment to Bryan and \nthe entire fundamentalist camp, who were not \nable to reconcile the inconsistencies between \nScripture and science as introduced by Darrow. \nThe verdict was eventually reversed, and as time \nprogressed, conservative states lifted their bans \non the exposition of evolution in public schools \n(Maurer, 2009, p. 64). \nThe Scopes trial was largely considered fun-\ndamentalists’ last stand. They retreated from \nmainstream culture, but Hankins notes that \nthey did not disappear. He writes that as fun-\ndamentalists withdrew following their major \nembarrassment, “[they] began building their \nown denominations, Bible institutes, magazines \nand so forth. In conjunction with this realign-\nment, they largely abandoned efforts to banish \nevolution from schools, just as fundamentalists \nafter Scopes gave up on the effort to recapture \nthe mainline Protestant denominations from \nthe modernists” (p. 68-69). The battle against \nevolution was no longer primarily fought in \nAmerican schools and courtrooms; instead, \nfundamentalists waged it among themselves \nin order to solidify their creationistic convic-\ntions, especially within the context of their \nnew “Evangelical” denominations (Hankins, \n2008, p. 68-69; Harris, 1998, p. 42-43). As \nmentioned above, there exists a certain degree \nof tension when referring to Evangelicals as \n“fundamentalists,” but Harris notes, “New \nevangelicals occasioned a renaissance in funda-\nmentalist scholarship” (p. 43). Much of today’s \nEvangelical institutions come from fundamen-\ntalist descent, and as today’s Evangelicalism \nvaries amongst a broad spectrum of denomi-\nnations, so too does it exude varying degrees of \nfundamentalist thought (p. 44).  \nAt this point in history, there are those in \nthe Christian church who will readily accept \nevolution as fact and will not contest it with their \nfaith. It should be noted that the majority of \nCatholics and mainline Protestants (Methodist, \nAnglican, etc.) accept evolution as fact (Pew \nResearch, 2013). Several Christian universities \nteach evolution and consider it “good science” \nthat is compatible with Christian doctrine \n(Schuman, 2010). Not all agree, however, as 64% \nof white Evangelicals believe that human beings \nalways existed in present form (Pew Research, \nFoster | 93\n Papers & Publications, vol. 6\n2013). Seventy-five percent of Evangelical \nministers “strongly disagree” that evolution is \nthe best explanation for the origin of life (Jelen, \n2010). The board of trustees at Bryan College, a \nChristian school in Dayton, Tennessee, contro-\nversially clarified the school’s statement of belief \nto say that Adam and Eve were historical figures \nthat were not created from previously existing \nlife forms. This led to the departure of nine of \nthe 44 full-time professors at Bryan, a vote of \nno-confidence in the college’s president, and a \nschool-wide student protest (The Tennessean, \n2014).\nAs a whole, both inside and outside the \nacademy, Millennials should be noted for \ntheir significant acceptance of science. A 2013 \nPew Research report shows a 68% support for \nevolution (rather than static human existence) \namong 18 to 29 year-old Americans. This \nsurpassed all other age groups surveyed. A survey \nof public, private, and religious colleges in New \nEngland revealed that 69.8% of public college \nstudents, 59.7% of private college students, \nand 62.1% of college students in a religious \nsetting openly accepted evolution. The average \ntotaled to a 63.4% acceptance of evolutionary \ntheory (Paz-y-Mino-C, 2013). Another, more \nlocalized, study by Paz-y-Mino-C on a secular, \nliberal arts university in the Northeast showed \nthat 78% of students supported the teaching of \nhuman evolution. Seventy and one-half percent \nof biology majors valued evolution as factual \nwhile only 55.6% of non-biology majors agreed \n(2008). Regarding Millennial disillusionment \nwith the church, Barna Group lists a major \nreason: “Churches come across as antagonistic \nto science.” Three out of ten Millennials with \nChristian backgrounds consider the church \nto be “out of touch with the scientific world \nwe live in.” One in four goes so far to say that \n“Christianity is anti-science.” And ultimately, \n23% have been “turned off by the creation-ver-\nsus-evolution debate” (2011).\nEven in light of the ensuing argument \nbetween creationists and evolutionists within \nthe church and the overall Millennial view of \nscience, little attention has been given to the \nopinions of Millennials within the sphere of \nChristian higher education. Among the few \nstudies of Christian universities, Ladine’s (2009) \nresearch at East Texas Baptist University investi-\ngates students’ attitudes toward the teaching of \nevolution. Three hundred and eleven students \nwere given a 15-question survey pertaining \nto the definition of evolution, the students’ \nreligious affiliation, major, academic year, and \nopinion on how evolution should be taught. \nBiology majors were more likely to respond \nwith the correct definition of evolution, as were \nstudents of higher seniority regardless of major. \nNonetheless, 89% of all students believed God \nplayed a role in the creation, and 64% agreed \nthat God should be included in the definition of \nscience (Ladine, 2009).\nPaz-y-Mino-C compared perspectives of \nevolution, creationism, and intelligent design \nbetween a secular and a religious college in \nthe northeastern USA. An average of 64% of \nbiology majors combined in both institutions \nsupported the exclusive teaching of evolution \nin science classes. Among non-biology majors, \n42% opposed the exclusive teaching of evolution \nin the secular college and 62% in the religious \ncollege. In addition, the higher the academic \nlevel of the students, the more likely they were \nto accept evolution as fact (2009a). These studies \nmake the lack of enthusiasm regarding evolution \napparent within religious colleges, but their in-\ndependent variables do not capture the target \naudience’s overall ethos. The question of why \nstudents in an Evangelical Christian university \naccept or reject evolutionary theory remains \nunanswered.\nMethods\nSource of Data\nThe overall design of this project takes a quanti-\ntative approach in order to explore the following \nquestion: “to what extent do Millennials in a \nChristian university accept evolutionary theory, \nand what are the variables that affect their \nopinions?” An online, cross-sectional, non-prob-\nable sampling survey was conducted through \nSurveyMonkey among a population of 169 \nstudents at an Evangelical Christian university \nin the Southeast. These students were recruited \nthrough introductory classes, social media, and \nword of mouth; all survey participation was \n94 | Foster\nThe Young and the Religious\nvoluntary. Most independent variables lost three \ncases to missing data, measuring a sample size of \n166. Few lost more, and we will expound upon \neach of these independent variables further in \nthis paper.\nInstrumentation\nAn online, ten-question survey consisting of \nnine sociodemographic questions that pertain \nto academic major, religious practice, academic \nlevel, and political affiliation was administered \nto the participants. These sociodemographic \nquestions served as independent variables for \nthis study, five of which surveyed the students’ \neducational experience, academic level, political \nparty, academic department, and whether \ntheir parents were affiliated with any religion. \nThese five were tested as categorical indepen-\ndent variables, and because we used a binary \nlogistic regression, we recoded each of these \nfive variables into dummy variables to pinpoint \nvalues consistent with our hypotheses (see Table \n1b). Three of the remaining four independent \nvariables measured students’ religious practice, \nthat is, the frequency in which students partici-\npate in religious services, read sacred texts (e.g., \nBible, Qur’an, Tanakh, etc.) outside of religious \nservices, and pray outside of religious services. \nThese religiosity variables were lumped in with \none question regarding the students’ political \nideology as scale variables (see Table 2).\nThe dependent variable in this study was \nasked as a dichotomous variable, prompting the \nparticipants to choose which statement comes \nclosest to their opinion: “humans have evolved, \nmeaning they have developed over millions of \nyears from less advanced forms of life” (support-\ning evolutionary theory) or “humans have existed \nin their present species, homo sapiens, since \nthe beginning of time” (opposing evolutionary \ntheory). The dependent variable was coded as \na dummy variable, with 1 = supporting evolu-\ntionary theory and 0 = opposing evolutionary \ntheory. The sentiment opposing evolution was \noverwhelming, with 85.9% of those surveyed \nopposing evolution as defined in this survey. \nOnly 14.1% of this sample expressed support \nfor evolution (see Table 1a). Among our categor-\nical independent variables, one question asked \nstudents to identify which educational medium \ncomes closest to their experience before univer-\nsity. Our frequency data shows that the largest \nmedium was public school (57.8%), with our \nsmallest value being those who took the GED \n(1.2%; see Table 1a). Because we expected those \nwho attended public school to be more likely to \naffirm evolution than those educated through \nother means, we recoded this question into a \ndummy variable. The value of 1 was attributed \nto those who attended public school; the value \nof 0 served as an “Other” category (including \nhomeschool, private Christian, private secular, \nand General Educational Development (GED); \nsee Table 1b).\nOur frequency data shows that the majority \nof students surveyed in this study were sopho-\nmores (34.3%). The smallest group surveyed \nwere graduate students (.6%; see Table 1a). From \nour hypothesis, it was suggested that the higher \nstudents’ academic level, the more likely they are \nto affirm evolution. For this reason, we recoded \nthe value of seniors (with a valid percent of \n14.2%) as 1, with the rest of the values recoded \nas 0 (see Table 1b). Because of the low output \nof graduate students, they were not used as the \nreference value for our dummy variable.\nThe students were further asked to select \nthe political party with which they most closely \nidentify. Our highest valid percentage came \nfrom those identifying with the Republican \nParty (45.0%); our lowest was the Democratic \nParty (9.5%; see Table 1a). Because we have hy-\npothesized that those of a more liberal political \npersuasion are more likely to accept evolution, \nand that Democrats are statistically more likely \nto affirm evolution than Republicans or inde-\npendents (Pew Research, 2013), we recoded \nthis value as Democratic Party = 1, with the \nRepublican Party, Independent/Other, and \n“Don’t know” = 0 (see Table 1b)\nStudents were asked whether either of their \nparents identify with any religion, with possible \nanswers being “Yes,” “No,” or “Uncertain.” \nOur highest value was an overwhelming “Yes” \nat 94.9%, and “Uncertain” being the lowest at \n1.9% (see Table 1a). Like the other categorical \nvariables, this was also recoded as a dummy \nvariable but under a different criteria.

This was done to remain \nconsistent with a binary yes/no (1/0) criteria, \neven though using “No” as our reference point \nwould have been consistent with our hypotheses \nregarding secularization.\nFinally, we asked students to identify the \nacademic department to which their field of study \nbelongs. There is a limitation here because we \ndid not list every specific major that this univer-\nsity offers, and leaving the question open-ended \ncould have resulted in ambiguous and missing \ndata. So, for the sake of convenience, we listed \neach academic department for students to select \nbased on their major. Thirteen academic depart-\nments were provided as options with the highest \nfrequency output resting on Early Childhood, \nElementary, and Special Education (16.3%). \nThe lowest was Music at 2.4% (see Table 1a). \nBecause one of our hypotheses states that hard \nscience majors are much more likely to accept \nevolution than non-hard science majors, we \nrecoded Natural Sciences and Mathematics = \n1 and all other departments = 0 \n(see Table 1b).\nPolitical ideology among \nstudents was measured as a \nscale variable, with each value \nattributed as 1 = “Very Liberal,” \n2 = “Liberal,” 3 = “Moderate,” 4 \n= “Conservative,” and 5 = “Very \nConservative.” The value of 6 is attributed to the \n“Don’t know” category. As a whole, the political \nideology variable has a mean (M) of 3.7711 and \na standard deviation (S) of 1.11546, showing \nus that the highest frequency rests largely \non “Conservative” and “Moderate” students \n(see Table 2). This is not without limitations, \nhowever, as self-descriptive political ideology \nmay vary by arbitrary characteristics. The term \n“liberal” means different things to different \npeople (Campbell, 2015). Nonetheless, this \nserves to test the hypothesis that those of a more \nliberal political persuasion are more likely to \naffirm evolution.\nStudents’ prayer lives outside of religious \nservices served as one of our three religious \npractice variables. Measured at a scale, the \nquestion asks, “How often do you pray outside of \nreligious services?” The values were appropriated \nas follows: 1 = “Never,” 2 = “Seldom,” 3 = “A few \ntimes a month,” 4 = “At least once a week,” and \n5 = “Every day.” The mean (M) is shown to be at \n4.5096 with a standard deviation (S) = 1.11546. \nThus, we see that students at this university pray \nmore often than less outside of religious services \n(see Table 2). Regarding actual attendance of \nTable 2: Means of Scale Variables\nPolitical Ideology M = 3.7711 S = 1.11546\nPrayer outside religious services M = 4.5096 S = .82910\nAttendance of religious services M = 5.2975 S = .97425\nReading of sacred texts M = 3.9304 S = .99756\nFoster | 97\n Papers & Publications, vol. 6\nservices, our values are appropriated as follows: \n1 = “Never,” 2 = “Seldom,” 3 = “A few times a \nyear,” 4 = “Once or twice a month,” 5 = “Once \na week,” and 5 = “More than once a week.” The \nmean (M) = 5.2975, and standard deviation \n(S) = .97425. Again, we see a higher inclina-\ntion towards religiosity among this sample of \nstudents. Our final religiosity variable measured \nhow often students read their sacred texts. The \nquestion itself asks, “How often do you read \nsacred texts (Bible, Quran, Tanakh, etc.) outside \nof religious services?” The values are appropriat-\ned as follows: 1 = “Never,” 2 = “Seldom,” 3 = “A \nfew times a month,” 4 = “At least once a week,” \nand 5 = “Every day.” The mean (M) = 3.9304 \nand standard deviation (S) = .99756. Although \nthis variable shows that students have a slightly \nlower propensity toward religious behavior in \ncomparison to the other religiosity variables, the \ntendency is still positive (see Table 2).\nData Analysis\nAnalysis of the data was conducted using SPSS. \nAs mentioned above, nine independent variables \npertaining to students’ backgrounds were split \ninto five categorical variables and four scale \nvariables. The five categorical variables (edu-\ncational experience, academic level, political \nparty, parents’ religion affiliation, and academic \ndepartment) were recoded as dummy variables \nand analyzed via Pearson’s chi-square test to \ndetermine significant correlation between these \nvariables and acceptance of evolution. The chi-\nsquare test can be expressed as follows:\nIn order to determine significance among our \nscale variables (political ideology, prayer, religious \nservice attendance, and reading of sacred texts), \nwe used an independent samples t-test to \ncompare means with the dependent dummy \nvariable serving as the grouping variable. The \nindependent t-test can be expressed as follows:\nThe dependent variable of acceptance (or lack \nthereof ) of evolution was measured as a dichoto-\nmous variable (a binary, “yes or no” answer), and, \nfor this reason, the overall survey was analyzed \nvia binary logistic regression to determine which \nof the students’ socialization variables predict \nacceptance of evolution. The logistic regression \nmodels can be expressed as follows:\nResults\nTable 3 shows us the results of our chi-square \nanalysis of the categorical independent dummy \nvariables in this study. Two variables were signif-\nicant (p < .001): Political Party and Academic \nDepartment. Therefore, from this table we can \nconclude that a student’s favored political party \nand the academic department to which he or she \nbelongs has a significant correlation to his or her \naffirmation of evolution.\nAs shown in Table 4, all three religiosity \nvariables are revealed to be significant factors \nin relation to the dependent variable. The most \nsignificant variables (p = .000) were Religious \nService Attendance and Reading of Religious \nTexts. These were closely followed by Prayer (p \n= .001). Thus, we can conclude that a student’s \nreligious practices are important measurements \nto consider regarding his or her opinion of \nevolution. Next, Table 5 will show us predictor \nvalues utilizing all independent variables via \nbinary logistic regression.\nTable 5a expresses the predictor value \nof the religiosity variables: Prayer, Religious \nService Attendance, and Reading of Sacred \nTexts. Focusing on these three alone, the \nSacred Texts variable was significant (p < .001). \nTable 5b introduces political variables to our \nreligious ones: Political Ideology and Political \nParty (1 = Democratic Party). Of these five \nindependent variables, Reading of Sacred \nTexts remains the most significant variable (p \n< .001) followed by Political Party (p < .05). \nTable 5c introduces all the remaining inde-\npendent variables in this study along with the \naforementioned, including Academic Level (1 \nO Ex E\ni i\nn\nii\n2\n2\n1\n-\n=\n=\nQ V|\nt\nx\ns\nx 121 2\nx x1 2\n=\n- - -\n-\n- -Q QV V\nln 1 p\np\n0 1- = +B B XS X\n98 | Foster\nThe Young and the Religious\n= Senior), Academic Department (1 = Natural \nSciences & Mathematics), Parents’ Religiosity \n(1 = Yes), and Educational Experience (1 = \nPublic School). Among all variables, students’ \nAcademic Department expressed the highest sig-\nnificance (p < .001), followed by the frequency \nof their reading Religious Texts (p < .01), and \nthe Political Party with which they identify (p \n< .05).\nFrom this we can conclude that if a student \nidentifies with the Democratic Party, he or she is \nroughly ten times more likely to affirm evolution \nas fact (Exp(B) = 10.218; see Table 5c). Regarding \nthe reading of sacred texts, we see that the beta \n(ß) value is negative (–1.121). This means that \nthe less someone reads his or her sacred text (in \nthis case, the Bible), the more likely he or she is to \naffirm evolution. And finally, if a student’s major \nfalls under the Department of Natural Sciences \n& Mathematics, the more likely he or she is to \naffirm evolution. This particular variable was by \nfar the most significant, and the Exp(B) value \nshows that Natural Sciences & Mathematics \nmajors are 11.861 times more likely to accept \nevolution than those who are not members of \nthis department (see Table 5c).\nConclusion\nAmong the students surveyed, those who affirmed \nevolutionary theory were a small minority. This \nis not surprising, given past studies on Christian \ninstitutions. Within this minority, however, we \nmay conclude from our results that students \nwho read less of their sacred text (largely in this \ncase, the Bible), those who identify with the \nDemocratic Party, and those whose academic \ndiscipline falls under the Department of Natural \nSciences & Mathematics, are all significantly \nmore likely to affirm evolution as fact. Two of \nour four hypotheses were supported by our data, \nthe first being that students who are hard science \nmajors are more likely to accept evolution than \nthose who are not. Since hard sciences are \nprimary concentrations within the Department \nof Natural Sciences & Mathematics, we suggest \nthat this renders our hypothesis plausible. The \nsecond supported hypothesis was that students \nof a more liberal political persuasion are more \nlikely to accept evolution than those who lean \nconservative. Since the Democratic Party is tra-\nditionally associated with more liberal political \nvalues, and since, from the literature and from \nour data, Democrats are more likely to affirm \nevolution, we suggest this renders our other hy-\npothesis plausible as well.\nThe significance of these three variables is \nunsurprising, especially in light of the literature. \nOne can infer that those who do not regularly \nread Scripture are certainly more likely to affirm \nthat which is widely considered to conflict \nwith Scripture. Thus, the result that suggests \nthose who do not regularly read Scripture are \nmore likely to affirm evolution as fact is under-\nstandable. However, this result should not be \nmisconstrued to promote the assumption that \nthose who affirm evolution are biblically illiter-\nate or irreligious. Such an assumption is false. It \ndoes, however, promote further discussion as to \nhow Scripture is interpreted among those who \npartook in this survey. Since those who read \nScripture more frequently were less likely to \naffirm evolution as fact than those who do not, \ndoes this suggest that the majority of frequent \nreaders hold a more literalist interpretation \nTable 3: Chi-Square of Basic Demographic\nVariables Pearson Chi-Square Test\n(* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001)\nEducational Experience .477\nAcademic Level 3.547\nPolitical Party 14.741***\nAcademic Department 11.908***\nParents’ Religious \nAffiliation\n.145\nTable 4: Comparison of Means by Political \nIdeology and Religious Variables\nVariables T-test (sig.)\n(* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001)\nPolitical Ideology –1.019 (.310)\nPrayer –3.506 (.001)***\nReligious Service \nAttendance\n–3.822 (.000)***\nReading of Sacred Texts –5.665 (.000)***\nFoster | 99\n Papers & Publications, vol. 6\nTable 5a: Binary Logistic Regression — Model 1 \n(* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001)\nVariables β Exp(B)\nConstant 2.988 19.848\nPrayer .298 1.347\nReligious Service Attendance –.443 .642\nReading of Sacred Texts –1.071*** .343***\nTable 5b: Binary Logistic Regression — Model 2 \n(* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001)\nVariables β Exp(B)\nConstant 3.007 20.217\nPrayer .393 1.481\nReligious Service Attendance –.463 .630\nReading of Sacred Texts –1.082*** .339***\nPolitical Ideology –.143 .867\nPolitical Party (1 = Democratic Party) 1.592* 4.912*\nTable 5c: Binary Lotistic Regression — Model 3 \n(* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001)\nVariables β Exp(B)\nConstant 3.276 26.470\nPrayer .458 1.580\nReligious Service Attendance –.517 .596\nReading of Sacred Texts –1.121** .326**\nPolitical Ideology –.115 .891\nPolitical Party \n(1 = Democratic Party)\n2.324* 10.218*\nAcademic Level \n(1 = Senior)\n1.181 3.258\nAcademic Department \n(1 = Natural Sciences & Mathematics)\n2.473** 11.861**\nReligious Parents\n (1=Yes)\n–.557 .573\nEducational Experience (1 = Public School) –1.239 .290\n100 | Foster\nThe Young and the Religious\nof the Genesis narrative? Inquiry exploring \nstudents’ delegation of value to Scripture and \nexegesis would likely provide interesting answers \nin future research. \nThis study was not without limitations. To \nbegin, our sample size was only 169 participants \nwith missing cases attributed to all variables at \ndifferent levels. Furthermore, regarding a few of \nour independent variables, precision proved to \nbe difficult. Not every academic discipline was \nlisted for students to choose from in the survey. \nFor the sake of time, convenience, and neatness, \nwe settled for the thirteen academic departments \nof the university studied. The political ideology \nvariable was also difficult to measure. As stated \nabove, self-descriptive political ideology may \nvary by individual arbitrariness. The terms \n“liberal” and “conservative” mean different \nthings to different people. However, we are \npleased with the categorical question asking \nparticipants with which political party they \nidentify the most. We feel this offers a more \ndetailed political criteria, for though people may \narbitrarily refer to themselves as “liberal,” “con-\nservative,” or “independent,” identifying with a \npolitical party carries heavier implications.\nIs the data consistent with what seculariza-\ntion theory propagates? Examining the three \nvariables which have significant predictor value \nin regards to acceptance of evolution, we would \nsuggest that the infrequency in reading sacred \ntexts, studying an academic discipline within \nthe hard sciences, and identifying with the \nDemocratic Party all share traits consistent with \nsecularization theory. If we take into account \nDurkheim’s view of secularization as a deviation \nfrom overarching religious norms and values, we \ncan see how each of these variables carry secular \nvalue within an Evangelical context. Failure to \nread one’s Bible is a very secular thing to do, \nnaturally. Identifying with the Democratic Party, \nwhich generally deviates from fundamentalist \nvalues and is not always looked upon fondly by \nthe Evangelical world, carries a secular connota-\ntion within this conservative Christian context. \nAnd pursuing an academic discipline such as \nthe hard sciences, which deviates from a fun-\ndamentalist creation narrative by its generally \nunderstood acceptance of evolutionary theory, \nimplies a certain degree of secular adherence. \nLet it be understood that we are not suggesting \nthat those who rarely read Scripture, those who \nidentify with the Democratic Party, and those \nwho study the hard sciences cannot be people of \nfaith.  We would suggest, however, from a social \nscientific standpoint, adherence to certain “sec-\nularized” ideologies and behaviors can predict a \npositive disposition toward evolutionary theory, \nwhich is itself considered a secular value in the \nEvangelical world.\nReferences\nBarna Group (2011).

    "abstract": "The debate between creationism and evolution has been hotly argued throughout contemporary history. The Millennial generation’s widespread acceptance of science and declining interest in religion is well-documented. However, Millennials in Christian settings are often left out of the literature. Taking into account Millennials’ opinions on religion and science, it is important for us to discover the extent of secularization among Millennials in Christian universities to fill this deficiency. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to test the theory of secularization (the idea that religious influence over society is weakening due to increasing modernity, namely science) among Millennials attending a Christian university by measuring their support of evolutionary theory as opposed to creationist theory. To do this, we measured students’ acceptance of evolution at an Evangelical Christian university and the variables that may predict their opinions. “Evolution” in this study is defined as humanity’s development over the course of millions of years from less advanced forms of life. Our data was generated from an online non-probable sampling survey of 169 students in a Christian university setting. The independent variables we tested include students’ academic discipline, academic level, religiosity, political affiliation, and other socialization variables. Using a binary logistic regression, significant predictor value for acceptance of evolution was found in students’ identification with the Democratic Party (p \\u3c .05), students’ infrequency in reading sacred texts such as the Bible (p \\u3c .01), and students’ pursuing academic disciplines which are part of the Department of Natural Sciences & Mathematics (p \\u3c .001)",
