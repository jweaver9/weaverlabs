While there has been a shift in community and political \nopinion, the issue of same-sex marriage remains complex and controversial. It has raised human rights and \nconstitutional law issues, as well as a raft of social, religious, moral and political questions.  \nThe purpose of this Research Paper is to update a 2012 Parliamentary Library Background Note and to draw \nmore widely on the extensive resources available on this subject. The paper covers a range of topics including: \n• the views of the political parties \n• constitutional issues and the 2013 High Court Same-sex marriage case. In that case the Court found the ACT \nsame-sex marriage law was in conflict with the Commonwealth Marriage Act 1961 and therefore inoperative \nand ‘of no effect’. Equally significantly, the Court resolved any doubts as to the scope of the ‘marriage power’ \nfinding that the federal Parliament has the power to legislate about same-sex marriage  \n• a comparative analysis of the four private member Bills before the Parliament, introduced by Senator Hanson \nYoung, Senator Leyonhjelm, Mr Shorten MP and a cross party Bill sponsored by Mr Entsch MP. All Bills are \nsimilar in that they insert a new identical definition of marriage into the Marriage Act encompassing unions \nof any two people regardless of sex, and repeal the existing ban on the recognition of same-sex marriages \nsolemnised overseas. The Bills differ in style and substance in relation to the provisions dealing with \nexemptions for marriage celebrants who may have religious or conscience objections to solemnising gay \nmarriages \n• a short section comparing the differences between a plebiscite and a referendum, included in response to \nthe recent announcement  by the Prime Minister that a popular vote will be held  \n• comparative material on international developments in other common law countries that have legalised \nsame-sex marriage including the United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand, the United States and Canada \n• a discussion of the arguments about the possible conflict between marriage equality and religious freedom  \nincluding the Australian Human Rights Commissioner’s proposed compromise of providing a ‘two tier’ \napproach that would structurally separate the religious and civil definitions of marriage in the Marriage Act \n(Cth) but treat them equally in law.    \nIn addition, the paper replicates parts of the 2012 Background Note, including a history and outline of the \nMarriage Act and an appendix dealing with other forms of relationship recognition.  \nAs the paper concludes, Australia has achieved a high degree of equality between the treatment of same-sex \nand heterosexual relationships with marriage remaining the one significant area of difference. For some, it is \nimportant to take time to ponder and consider the full implications of changing the meaning of this ancient \ninstitution.  For others, including those who live with the memories and scars of the criminalisation and \nprejudice endured by homosexuals in the past, it is important to move swiftly to remove this last remaining area \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 2 \nof difference. Overseas experience would suggest that a long and protracted discussion about the meaning of \nmarriage, leading up to a popular vote some 18 months away, is likely to promote a passionate, robust and even \nstrident or divisive debate within the Australian community. \nContents \nExecutive summary ..................................................................................... 1 \nIntroduction ................................................................................................ 4 \nPosition of the political parties .................................................................... 5 \nAustralian Labor Party ........................................................................................ 5 \nCoalition .............................................................................................................. 5 \nAustralian Greens ............................................................................................... 6 \nThe Marriage Act 1961—outline................................................................... 6 \nThe definition of ‘marriage’ and the 2004 amendments to the Marriage Act \n1961 .................................................................................................................... 7 \nConstitutional questions—The High Court and the Same-sex marriage case .. 8 \nThe legislative power of the Commonwealth with respect to same-sex \nmarriage and the definition of ‘marriage’ ...................................................... 10 \nAfter the Same-sex marriage case: can a state Parliament legislate for same-\nsex marriage?

During the 44th Parliament, that debate has further \nintensified, triggered in part by international developments in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the United \nStates and Ireland where same-sex marriage is now being permitted either through legislative or judicial means.  \nThe debate has been further spurred on by the introduction of a raft of private members Bills into the \nParliament; and more recently by the Coalition party room decision to reject a policy change on same-sex \nmarriage—the Prime Minister preferring instead a proposal to put the matter to a popular vote after the next \nelection. There has been a shift in community and political opinion however the issue of same-sex marriage \nremains complex and controversial. It has raised human rights and constitutional law issues, as well as a raft of \nsocial, religious, moral and political questions.  \nApart from marriage, it is generally accepted that the expansion of legal rights and protections afforded to same-\nsex couples in Australia is well developed at both federal and state level. For example, legislation exists in four \nstates and the Australian Capital Territory that provides for the legal recognition of relationships that may \ninclude same-sex unions.1 At the federal level, in 2008 and 2009 there was a wide-ranging suite of reforms to \nprovide equal entitlements and responsibilities for same-sex couples in areas such as social security, veterans’ \nentitlements, employment, taxation, superannuation, immigration and workers’ compensation.2 However there \nremains one significant area of difference between the treatment of same-sex and heterosexual relationships, \nand that is in relation to the institution of marriage. While there are fewer and fewer rights and obligations \nattached to married couples which do not attach to de facto couples—a status currently encompassing same-sex \ncouples in most legal contexts— supporters of gay rights argue this is not enough. They say civil unions and \ndomestic partner registries are not sufficient and, for true equality, same-sex couples must have the right to \nmarry.  \nThe purpose of this Research Paper is to update a Library Background Note on same-sex marriage published in \n2012.3  The paper takes account of developments regarding same-sex marriage that have occurred since 2012. It \ncontains new material on: \n• the position of the political parties \n• same-sex marriage Bills before the Parliament  \n• constitutional issues including the High Court Same-sex marriage case \n• the proposal for a popular vote  \n• the debate about marriage equality versus religious freedoms and \n• international developments focusing on common law countries (Appendix 1) \nThe Research Paper also replicates parts of the previous Background Note including the sections dealing with: \n• the Marriage Act 1961 (Cth)4 and the 2004 amendments to that Act and \n• alternative types of relationship recognition in Australia (Appendix 2)  \n  \n                                                             \n1.

Marriage Act 1961 (Cth), accessed 28 August 2015. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 5 \nPosition of the political parties \nAustralian Labor Party \nAt a political level, the two major parties had until 2011 opposed same-sex marriage. That situation changed in \nDecember 2011 when at the Labor Party Conference, the Party’s platform was amended to support same-sex \nmarriage but to allow Labor MPs to have a conscience vote.5 During the 43rd Parliament Labor chose not \nintroduce a government Bill but rather Labor backbencher Stephen Jones introduced a private member’s Bill. \nThat Bill was defeated at the second reading stage in the House of Representatives.6  \nIn July 2015, the issue of same-sex marriage was again on the Labor Party conference agenda with the Party \nagreeing to retain the existing policy of allowing a conscience vote during the current and next terms of \nParliament. However should same-sex marriage not be legalised by 2020 members would then be bound to \nsupport same-sex marriage. This motion was the compromise reached to accommodate those in the Party \ncalling for the removal of the conscience vote.7  \nOn 27 May 2015 the Opposition Leader Bill Shorten introduced a private member’s Bill into Parliament that \nwould legalise same-sex marriage and remove barriers to recognition of overseas same-sex marriage. The Bill is \nstill before the House. At the time of introduction Prime Minister Abbott and others suggested that such an \nimportant matter should be owned by the Parliament rather than one party. The Labor Party has since given \nsupport to the more recent cross party private member’s Bill introduced by Mr Warren Entsch. More recently \nMr Shorten has promised that if elected at the next election, a Labor Government would introduce marriage \nequality legislation within 100 days of taking office.8 \nCoalition \nThe Coalition’s policy has been, and remains, that marriage is a union between a man and woman. Prime \nMinister Abbott has consistently opposed same-sex marriage and in the parliamentary debates on the same-sex \nmarriage Bills during the 43rd Parliament, Coalition MPs were not permitted a conscience vote. In the 2013 \nelection campaign the Prime Minister retained his position and said that if elected a Coalition Government \nwould not introduce same-sex marriage in the government’s first term and that any proposal for change to this \npolicy would be put to a meeting of the joint party room.9 \nA number of Coalition members including cabinet ministers Malcolm Turnbull, Simon Birmingham, Josh \nFrydenberg and Kelly O’Dwyer have indicated they would support same-sex marriage legislation if the party \nroom determined a conscience vote is available.10  \nThe Coalition’s position was again in the spotlight in the first week of the Parliamentary sittings in August 2015. \nIn anticipation of the introduction of Liberal backbencher Warren Entsch’s private member’s Bill, the Prime \nMinister called a special Coalition party room meeting, to discuss the question of a conscience vote on same-sex \nmarriage.  After a six hour meeting, that was the subject of significant media reporting,11 the Coalition voted to \nretain its current position that marriage can only be a union between a man and a woman with no provision for \na conscience vote on the issue.  It is reported that 42 per cent of Liberal MPs and 14 per cent of Nationals MPs \nsupported a conscience vote on same-sex marriage, the combined vote being about one-third of the joint party \nroom.12  \n                                                             \n5.

Mr Abbott has said that the Bill sponsored by Warren \nEntsch will be accorded the normal rules of private member’s bills. Mr Abbott has also clearly indicated that, \nwhile backbenchers have the freedom to cross the floor, the normal rules would apply to member of cabinet \nwho would be expected to vote according to Party policy.14 \nAustralian Greens \nThe Australian Greens and before them the Australian Democrats have consistently supported same-sex \nmarriage and have sought to legislate in support of their position in all Parliaments since 2004.  \nThe Marriage Act 1961—outline \nThe Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) deals with a range of matters. Its main purpose at the time of enactment was to \nbring the regulation of marriage into the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Until 1961 marriage had been \nregulated by state and territory law and there were nine separate and diverse systems of marriage law in \nAustralia.15 Prior to Federation marriage had been covered by the laws of the colonies. The colonial statutes \ndealing with marriage and divorce were subject to disallowance by the Imperial Parliament, with a view, as Quick \nand Garran explained, to securing ‘uniformity of marriage laws among the Christian races of the Empire’.16 \nA Marriage Bill was first introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament in 1960. The Bill was not dealt with in \n1960 and was re-introduced in 1961. The federal Attorney-General Sir Garfield Barwick at the time stated the \nmain purpose of the legislation was to: \nProduce a marriage code suitable to present day Australian needs, a code which, on the one hand, paid proper \nregard to the antiquity and foundations of marriage as an institution, but which, on the other resolved modern \nproblems in a modern way.17 \nIn 1961 the concept of modern marriage was a heterosexual union where the parties pledged monogamy and \npermanency in their relationship.18 \nAmongst other things the Marriage Act currently: \n• sets the marriageable age and allows the marriage of minors in certain circumstances \n• establishes the framework for marriage ceremonies. Parties can marry in public or private, provided there is \nan official celebrant and two witnesses to the declarations between the parties. Particular words are \nprescribed for marriages solemnised by civil celebrants which reflect the understanding of marriage in \nAustralian law. Religions which have been recognised as requiring monogamy and permanency as promises \nof marriage are permitted to use their own ceremony.19 \n• establishes the framework of the regulation of authorised marriage celebrants (both religious and non-\nreligious) \n• deals with issues of consent, void marriages and legitimacy of children \n                                                             \n13.

Delivering the \nsecond reading speech, Attorney General Barwick said: \n… it will be observed that there is no attempt to define marriage in this bill. None of the marriage laws to which I \nhave referred contains any such definition. But insistence on monogamous quality is indicated by, on the one hand, \nthe provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act, which render a marriage void where one of the parties is already \nmarried, and by a provision in this bill making bigamy an offence.21 \nOn its passage through Parliament, Senator Gorton, who was responsible for the carriage of the Bill through the \nSenate, remarked: \n… in our view it is best to leave to the common law the definition or the evolution of the meaning of ‘marriage’ as it \nrelates to marriages in foreign countries and to use this bill to stipulate the conditions with which marriage in \nAustralia has to comply if it is to be a valid marriage.22  \nWhile the original Act did not define marriage, section 46 of the Act incorporated the substance of the \n19th century English case law definition of marriage found in Hyde v Hyde & Woodmansee.23 Section 46 says \nthat celebrants should explain the nature of the marriage relationship with words that include: \n...Marriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, \nvoluntarily entered into for life ... \nHowever these words were seen as a description or exhortation rather than a definition.24 \nThe definition of marriage now in the Marriage Act was inserted in 2004,25 its stated purpose being to reflect \n‘the understanding of marriage held by the vast majority of Australians’.26 The Government stated that: \nIt is time that those words form the formal definition of marriage in the Marriage Act. \nThe bill will achieve that result. \nIncluding this definition will remove any lingering concerns that people may have that the legal definition of \nmarriage may become eroded over time.27 \n                                                             \n20.

Ibid. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 8 \nThe definition of marriage was inserted along with changes to expressly preclude the recognition of same-sex \nmarriages conducted overseas. These amendments were in the main a response to the legalisation of same-sex \nmarriage in a number of overseas jurisdictions. In this regard, the Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, stated: \nA related concern held by many people is that there are now some countries that permit same-sex couples to \nmarry. It has been reported that there are a few Australian same-sex couples who may travel overseas to marry in \none of these countries on the basis that their marriage will then be recognised under Australian law on their return. \nAustralian law does, as a matter of general principle, recognise marriages entered into under the laws of another \ncountry, with some specific exceptions. It is the government‘s view that this does not apply to same-sex marriages. \nThe amendments to the Marriage Act contained in this bill will make it absolutely clear that Australia will not \nrecognise same-sex marriages entered into under the laws of another country, whatever country that may be.28 \nAt the time, these amendments and their method of enactment were controversial and contentious. There were \nin fact two Bills the first (the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2004) contained amendments to define \nmarriage and to preclude recognition of overseas same-sex marriages in Australia, but also included \namendments to prevent same-sex couples adopting children from overseas. This first Bill was referred to a \nSenate Committee for inquiry but within a day of its referral a second Bill (the Marriage Amendment Bill 2004) \nwas introduced into Parliament. This second Bill did not contain the amendments relating to overseas adoption \n—these being the ones that the Labor Party had indicated it would not support.29  At the same time, the \nparliamentary committee inquiry into the first Bill was also abandoned. The rationale for this unusual and \ndramatic change of direction was so that the Bill would have a speedy passage through the Parliament. The \nAttorney-General the Hon Philip Ruddock stated: \nIf this bill is acceded to today, I want to make it very clear that the reason for this, without breaching any privacy \nmatters, is that some parties have already sought recognition of offshore arrangements approved under the laws of \nother countries and would be seeking recognition under our law. \nIt is the government's view that the provisions of the Marriage Act which we are seeking to enact should not be \ndelayed and should not be the subject of Senate referral. The opposition having indicated its support for these \nmeasures should ensure—having restricted it to those matters that relate to a definition of marriage and the \nrecognition of overseas marriages, which they say they support—that they receive a speedy passage.30 \nWhile the legislation had the support of both major parties the Labor Party expressed reservations about the \nprocess of enactment.31 The Greens labelled it as discriminatory against the gay and lesbian community and \ncondemned both the Government and the Labor Party for failing to acknowledge the change in present day \nsociety in the make-up of couples.32  The Hon Alastair Nicholson, former Chief Justice of the Family Court of \nAustralia described it as ‘one of the most unfortunate pieces of legislation that has ever been passed by the \nAustralian Parliament’.33 \nConstitutional questions—The High Court and the Same-sex marriage case \nSection 51(xxi) of the Australian Constitution provides that the federal Parliament has power to make laws with \nrespect to ‘marriage’. That power is not further defined by the Constitution and until the 2013 High Court Same-\nsex marriage case34 there were doubts about whether the ‘marriage power’ could support a Commonwealth law \nthat recognises same-sex marriage. A key question had been whether the marriage power is the power fixed to \nits 1900 meaning, or is it able to evolve or adapt in line with changed events or attitudes. Legal academics, \nengaging with this question agreed that, should any Australian parliament legislate to allow same-sex marriage \nthere would undoubtedly be a constitutional challenge to its validity in the High Court.35 \n                                                             \n28.

Frank Brennan and George Williams, cited in M Neilsen, ‘Same-sex marriage’, Background note, 10 February 2012, Parliamentary Library, \nfootnote no. 32, accessed 17 August 2015.   \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 9 \nIn terms of the Constitution, the ‘marriage power’ is a ‘concurrent power’ meaning both the Commonwealth and \nthe states can make laws regarding marriage, however should the state law be inconsistent with the \nCommonwealth law (the Marriage Act), the Commonwealth law would prevail and the state law would become \ninoperative to the extent of the inconsistency.36  \nThe numerous unsuccessful attempts at federal level to bring about changes to the Marriage Act caused \nmarriage equality advocates to turn to reform at state level. Introducing same-sex marriage in a state and \nterritory was seen as a fall-back position with several states, including New South Wales, Tasmania, Western \nAustralia and South Australia making various attempts to introduce same-sex marriage laws.37 It was however \nthe ACT that established Australia’s first same-sex marriage laws with the enactment of the Marriage Equality \n(Same Sex) Act 2013 (ACT)38 (ACT Act) on 22 October 2013. A number of same-sex couples immediately took \nadvantage of this law to undertake their wedding vows and around 30 same-sex marriages were performed after \n7 December 2013, the date when, due to notice requirements, marriages could first occur. The new law received \nnational as well as local attention and was a cause for both celebration and condemnation.  \nThe Commonwealth’s response to the new ACT law was to bring a challenge in the High Court. On 12 December \n2013 in Commonwealth v Australian Capital Territory (the Same-sex marriage case), the Court held that the \nwhole of the Marriage Equality (Same Sex) Act (ACT) was inconsistent with the Marriage Act (Cth).39  As a result \nthe Court stated that the ACT law was inoperative and ‘of no effect’. This finding of inconsistency meant that the \nACT law had never come into effect and those ACT marriages ceremonies had not been authorised by law. The \npeople who had gone through a wedding ceremony had not actually been married. Some would say that those \n‘marriages’ were not in vain— that they had a social and psychological effect of making same-sex marriages \nmore acceptable. \nThe High Court’s decision on the ACT law was unanimous, decisive and remarkable on several levels. Firstly \nunlike courts in other jurisdictions considering a case of this kind,40 the decision was based not on human rights \nissues but rather on questions of federalism and inconsistency of laws. It was based upon the finding that the \nfederal Marriage Act provides ‘a comprehensive and exhaustive statement with respect to the creation and \nrecognition of the legal status of marriage’.41 In supporting this conclusion, the Court referred to the fact that \nthe Marriage Act had been amended in 2004 so as to define marriage as ‘the union of a man and a woman to \nthe exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life’, and to provide expressly that ‘a union solemnised in \na foreign country between persons of the same-sex must not be recognised as a marriage in Australia’.42 In these \ncircumstances, the Court held that the ACT Act was not capable of operating concurrently with the Marriage Act \n(Cth  to any extent.43  \nThe case was also remarkable in that the High Court provided a very broad definition of marriage, based on a \nnew approach to constitutional interpretation that some legal academics considered both surprising and \nunnecessary.44  While the case had not been framed by reference to the Commonwealth’s broader marriage \npower, the Court has now resolved any doubt as to the scope of that power. \n                                                             \n36.  Inconsistency between Commonwealth and state laws is governed by section 109 of the Constitution, which provides that, ‘when a law of a \nState is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be \ninvalid’.  In the case of the Australian Capital Territory, subsection 28(1) of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cth) \nprovides that a provision of an Australian Capital Territory enactment has no effect to the extent that it is inconsistent with a law of the \nCommonwealth in force in the territory but that ‘such a provision shall be taken to be consistent with such a law to the extent that it is \ncapable of operating concurrently with that law’. \n37.

The decision has effectively given a constitutional tick of approval to any potential \nfuture Commonwealth law providing for the solemnisation and recognition of same-sex marriage and will allow \nany future same-sex marriage legislation to be debated in the Commonwealth Parliament solely on its political \nand moral merits.46 \nThe legislative power of the Commonwealth with respect to same-sex marriage and the definition of \n‘marriage’  \nThe High Court approached the case by first considering the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to enact a \nlaw providing for the solemnisation of same-sex marriage. This, the Court said, was necessary because the ACT \nAct would probably operate concurrently with the Marriage Act if the federal Parliament had no power to make \na national law providing for same-sex marriage.47 \nThe Court was not prepared to consider directly the meaning of the term ‘marriage’ in 1900 or its meaning in \nAustralia today, holding that ‘the status of marriage, the social institution which that status reflects, and the \nrights and obligations which attach to that status never have been, and are not now, immutable’.48 Instead the \nCourt developed an alternative method of interpretation deciding that marriage in section 51(xxi) is a topic of \njuristic classification, the content of which is to include laws of a kind ‘generally considered, for comparative law \nand private international law, as being the subjects of a country’s marriage laws’.49 In other words, the meaning \nof marriage for constitutional purposes is to be interpreted by reference to the scope of marriage laws in a \nglobal sense.50  Accordingly, from this juristic classification, the Court concluded that marriage in section 51(xxi) \nof the Constitution is to be understood in an extremely broad sense as being:  \n… a consensual union formed between natural persons in accordance with legally prescribed requirements which is \nnot only a union the law recognises as intended to endure and be terminable only in accordance with law but also a \nunion to which the law accords a status affecting and defining mutual rights and obligations.51 \nThe High Court concluded that it was not possible to limit the juristic concept of marriage to that which occurs in \nChristian nations. It noted: \nSome jurisdictions outside Australia permit polygamy. Some jurisdictions outside Australia, in a variety of \nconstitutional settings, now permit marriage between same-sex couples [....] \n... It is not useful or relevant for this Court to examine how or why this has happened. What matters is that the \njuristic concept of marriage (the concept to which s 5 l(xxi) refers) embraces such unions. They are consensual \nunions of the kind which has been described.52 \nConstitutional Law Professor Anne Twomey, from the University of Sydney is critical of the High Court’s \napproach for several reasons. Firstly she argues that the Court went beyond the submissions of the parties and \nwhat was necessary to decide the case.53 Secondly Professor Twomey notes that the Court developed a new \napproach to constitutional interpretation and in doing so she argues it drew controversial links between \npolygamy and same-sex marriage which marriage equality activists have long been at pains to avoid. In her view \nthe Court has also developed a very broad constitutional meaning of ‘marriage’ which potentially incorporates \nrelationships to which many may currently object.54 \nOn the first of these matters, the need to declare the full scope of the marriage power, Twomey states: \n                                                             \n45.

Ibid. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 11 \n As is well known, the High Court has consistently refrained from declaring the full scope of a head of legislative \npower, as this would involve going beyond the matters at issue in the case before it. It would also involve the court \nin adjudicating on questions that affect the interests of others who have not been represented in the proceedings \nand were therefore unable to present arguments for the court's consideration. 55  \nUndoubtedly the Court framed the logic of its decision more broadly than was expected, however they felt \nimpelled by the logic of the situation to reach their conclusion. It is also important to note that having a broad \nCommonwealth power to regulate an area does not mean that it needs to be or will be used. \nFurthermore as Professor Twomey also acknowledges, if the High Court had not considered the scope of the \nmarriage power in this case, it would have been criticised for not taking the opportunity to resolve the \nuncertainty and avoid future litigation on the subject.  \nThe second area of criticism by Professor Twomey, the reliance by the Court on a ‘juristic classification of \nmarriage,’ raises questions of complex constitutional interpretation which are beyond the scope of this paper.56 \nFor further analysis of this case, the reader is referred to Professor Twomey’s papers and articles by Professor \nGeorge Williams and Patrick Parkinson and by Shipra Chordia.57 \nAfter the Same-sex marriage case: can a state Parliament legislate for same-sex marriage? \nA question remains as to whether it may be possible for a state to enact legislation providing for some form of \nlegal recognition of some different kind of union between same-sex couples; a union not in the nature of \n‘marriage’.  \nIt is generally agreed that since the Same-sex marriage case, there is little likelihood of success after the Court \nmade it clear that the mere avoidance of the term ‘marriage’ itself would not be enough to escape a conclusion \nthat such legislation is inconsistent with the Marriage Act: ‘the topic within which the status falls must be \nidentified by reference to the legal content and consequences of the status, not merely the description given to \nit’.58  \nWell-known constitutional lawyer Professor George Williams has argued there are good legal reasons why \nAustralia's state parliaments might continue to consider same-sex marriage law and that such debates would be \nfar from a waste of time: \nIt remains possible as a matter of law for a state to enact a same-sex marriage statute. Such a law could be \ndefended in the High Court and it is possible, though unlikely, that it would survive such a challenge. However, even \nif the High Court found the state statute to be inconsistent with the federal Marriage Act, the state law would \nremain on the statute books. Indeed, it would be revived if the federal Marriage Act were amended to provide \nroom for its operation.59 \nQuite apart from these legal arguments, Williams also believes there are other policy reasons why a state \nparliament might consider enacting its own same-sex marriage law. \nParliamentarians not only make laws, they provide leadership to the community on social and other issues. \nIrrespective of any legal outcome, enacting a same-sex marriage law would provide a very strong statement of \nsupport for such a change, and more generally for principles such as equality and non-discrimination. State \nleadership could even play a key role in the national debate. The enactment of state same-sex marriage laws, \nwhatever the outcome in the High Court, would place further pressure on the federal Parliament to act.60 \n                                                             \n55.

Ibid. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 12 \nBills supporting amendment of the Marriage Act 1961 to allow same-sex marriage \nSince the enactment of the 2004 amendments to the Marriage Act (Cth) which inserted the current definition of \nmarriage, there have been 17 Bills dealing with same-sex marriage introduced into the federal Parliament. Only \nfour of those Bills have come to a vote and no Bill has progressed past the second reading stage. All 17 Bills have \nbeen private members’ Bills, introduced by members of parliament representing the Australian Democrats, the \nAustralian Greens, the Australian Labor Party, independents, and one Liberal Democratic Party member. \nParliamentary Committees have reported on five of those 17 Bills. \nFor further detail on these Bills, the reader is referred to: \n• D McKeown, Chronology of same-sex marriage bills introduced into the federal parliament: a quick guide, \nResearch paper series, 2014–2015,  29 June 2015. \nFor further detail on Bills in the 43rd Parliament, the reader is referred to: \n• M Neilsen, Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 [and] Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 [and] Marriage \nEquality Amendment Bill 2010, Bills digest, 158, 2011–12, June 2012. \nBills in the current Parliament (44th Parliament) \nCurrently there are four private members Bills before the Parliament that would amend the Marriage Act to \npermit same-sex marriage61: \n• Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2013 introduced on 12 December 2013  by Senator Sarah Hanson Young  \n(the Hanson Young Bill) \n• Marriage Amendment (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015 introduced on 1 June 2015 by Mr Bill Shorten MP (the \nShorten Bill) \n• Freedom to Marry Bill 2014  introduced on 26 November 2014 by Senator David Leyonhjelm, (the Leyonhjelm \nBill) \n• Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 introduced on 17 August 2015 as a cross party Bill by Mr Warren \nEntsch MP, Ms Teresa Gambaro, MP, Ms Terri Butler MP, Mr Laurie, Ferguson MP, Mr A Bandt MP, Ms Cathy \nMcGowan and Mr Andrew Wilkie MP (the Entsch Cross Party Bill). The Bill has been described as significant \nand somewhat unique in that it ‘has the rare distinction of enjoying very strong cross-party support’.62 \nThe following commentary makes a number of references to the House of Representatives Standing Committee \non Social Policy and Legal Affairs 2012 inquiry into same-sex marriage Bills.63 For consistency the committee is \nreferred to as the ‘2012 committee inquiry into the same-sex marriage Bills’. \nPurpose of the Bills  \nThe purpose of all four Bills is:  \n• to allow any two people to marry \n• to allow same-sex marriages conducted overseas to be recognised under Australian law and \n• to provide for or clarify that a minister of religion or a chaplain would not be compelled to solemnise a \nmarriage. The Leyonhjelm Bill extends this provision to cover Commonwealth marriage celebrants.  \nThe Leyonhjelm Bill and Entsch Cross Party Bill have an additional purpose to: \n• provide that state and territory marriage registrars may not refuse to celebrate marriages that would be valid \naccording to the Marriage Act (Cth).  \n                                                             \n61.  Note that there is a further Bill, the Recognition of Foreign Marriages Bill 2014, introduced by Senator Sarah Hanson Young on 15 April 2014. \nThat Bill amends the Marriage Act 1961 to remove the prohibition on the recognition of same-sex marriages solemnised in a foreign country. \nThe Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 3 September 2014. The \nCommittee recommended that the Bill not be passed.  \n62.

Submissions \nto the 2012 Committee inquiry into the same-sex marriage Bills recommended the Canadian model and \nsuggested that drafting the definition in these terms without reference to sex, sexual orientation, or gender \nidentity was to be preferred.65 \nRecognition of same-sex marriages conducted overseas \nAll four Bills repeal section 88EA of the Marriage Act that prohibits the recognition of marriage between same-\nsex couples solemnised in a foreign country. The effect of the repeal would be that same-sex marriages \nsolemnised in a foreign country will be recognised in Australia as valid marriages (subject to any of the \nrestrictions which currently apply in section 88D).66  The Entsch Cross Party Bill also provides that this \namendment will apply retrospectively meaning that overseas same-sex marriages that took place prior to \ncommencement of this amendment will also be recognised. The previous Bills do not include this provision and it \nis unclear whether this amendment is necessary to enable earlier overseas same-sex marriages to be recognised. \nAuthorised celebrants under the Marriage Act \nUnder the Marriage Act (Cth), there are three major classes of authorised marriage celebrants. Two of these \ncontinue to be regulated by the state and territory Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the third and \nmore recent class is regulated by the Commonwealth. These classes are: \n• celebrants from recognised religious denominations proclaimed under section 26 of the Marriage Act who \nare nominated by their denomination and registered and regulated by state and territory Registries of Births, \nDeaths and Marriages (‘recognised religious denomination celebrants’) \n• state and territory officers authorised to solemnise marriages under subsection 39(1) of the Marriage Act and \nregistered by state and territory Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages (‘state and territory marriage \nregistrars’) \n• Commonwealth-registered marriage celebrants who are authorised under the Marriage Celebrants Program \nto perform marriages (‘Commonwealth marriage celebrants’). This group includes civil celebrants and \ncelebrants who are ministers of religion whose denomination is not proclaimed under section 26 of the \nMarriage Act (for example, Sikhs, Buddhists and World Harvest Ministries)  \nThere is also a fourth much smaller category of celebrants, namely Defence Force chaplains. Part V of the \nMarriage Act (Cth) allows Defence Force chaplains to solemnise marriages where at least one of the parties is a \nmember of the Defence Force and where this marriage occurs in an overseas country.67    \nCurrent exemption for ministers of religion in the Marriage Act \nSection 47 of the Marriage Act (Cth) provides that religious ministers can refuse to solemnise any particular \nmarriage: \nNothing in this Part: \n(a) imposes an obligation on an authorised celebrant, being a minister of religion, to solemnise any marriage; or \n                                                             \n64.  The Hanson-Young Bill and the Shorten Bill use the word ‘two’; the Leyonhjelm Bill and Entsch Cross Party Bill use the number ‘2’. \n65.

For example prohibited relationships such as sibling marriages, or if either party is under the age of 16 years (section 88D).  \n67.  Marriage Act (Cth), section 71. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 14 \n(b) prevents such an authorised celebrant from making it a condition of his or her solemnising a marriage that: \n(i) longer notice of intention to marry than that required by this Act is given; or \n (ii) requirements additional to those provided by this Act are observed.  \nExemptions for ministers of religion in the four Bills  \nThe four Bills all have provisions clarifying that ministers of religion are not bound to solemnise same-sex \nmarriages. However the Bills differ in substance and approach. All four Bills include a clarifying provision stating \nthat ministers of religions are not bound to solemnise any marriage. The clarification clauses in the Hanson-\nYoung Bill and Leyonhjelm Bill are drafted so that they would remain in the amending Act. In contrast the clauses \nin the Shorten Bill and the Entsch Cross Party Bill are more explicit and drafted so that they would be inserted in \nthe Marriage Act (Cth) at the end of section 47.  \nIn the Hanson Young Bill item 8 in Schedule 1 of the Bill states:  \nTo avoid doubt, the amendments made by this Schedule do not limit the effect of section 47 (ministers of religion \nnot bound to solemnise marriage etc.) of the Marriage Act 1961.  \nThe Leyonhjelm Bill is similar. Item 9 in Schedule 1 adds a clarifying note that would remain in the Freedom to \nMarry Act rather than the Marriage Act: \nTo avoid doubt, the amendments made by this Schedule do not require ministers of religion to solemnise marriages. \nIn contrast, the Shorten Bill and the Entsch Cross Party Bill amend section 47 in the Marriage Act adding a note \nat the end of that provision stating: \none effect of paragraph (a) is that a minister of religion cannot be required to solemnise a marriage where the \nparties to the marriage are of the same sex (Shorten Bill)68 \na minister of religion may refuse to solemnise a marriage for any reason, including because to do so would be \ncontrary to the minister’s beliefs or the minister’s understanding of the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of the \nminister’s denomination’.69 (Entsch Cross Party Bill) \nBoth styles of drafting have a similar effect, although the approach in the Shorten/Entsch Bills of inserting the \nmore explicit note into the Principal Act may provide more clarity. In commenting on similar provisions in the \nsame-sex marriage Bills tabled in the last Parliament, the Gilbert & Tobin Centre of Public Law argued: \n being as explicit as possible in  the Bill on this point in the context of same-sex marriage may be desirable, \nparticularly given the Constitution’s guarantee in section 116 that the Commonwealth cannot limit the free exercise \nof religion. 70 \nSection 47: ‘or in any other law’  \nThe Shorten, Hanson Young and Entsch Cross Party Bills all amend section 47 in the Marriage Act (Cth) by adding \nthe words ‘or in any other law’ to make it clear that there is no other source of legal obligation on a minister of \nreligion to solemnise a marriage.  The Explanatory Memorandum to the Entsch Cross Party Bill states that this \namendment is necessary to ensure that other laws, such as the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) do not compel \nministers of religion to solemnise a marriage.71  A minister might refuse to solemnise a marriage for any reason, \nincluding because it would be contrary to the minister’s beliefs, or understanding of the doctrines, tenets, beliefs \nor teachings of the minister’s denomination.72 \n                                                             \n68.

Ibid. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 15 \nIt is of note that some religious groups requested this amendment when making submissions to the 2012 \nparliamentary committees inquiring into the same-sex marriage Bills. They argued that this is necessary to make \nclear that there is no other source of legal obligation (such as anti-discrimination or equality laws) for a minister \nof religion to solemnise a marriage involving a same-sex couple.73 \nExemption for ‘authorised celebrants’  \nThe Leyonhjelm Bill extends the exemption in section 47 beyond ministers of religion to other authorised \ncelebrants with the exception of state and territory marriage registrars. The rationale for this amendment is to \nprotect not only religious conscience but also conscience claims by those who are not religious.74 \nThe Coalition of Celebrant Associations Inc (CoCA)  argued for such an exemption in their submissions to the \n2012 Committee inquiry into the same-sex marriage bills. CoCA’s submission states: \nIt cannot be assumed that all celebrants who deliver civil marriage services would support a change in the definition \nof marriage. Because of the broad range of authorised persons, there are varying levels of support for any change in \nthe definition of marriage that gives equal legal recognition to same sex relationships. CoCA considers  that if \nreligious celebrants are given the freedom to choose or refuse to marry any couple on the basis of belief, then the \nsame respect needs to be afforded to celebrants offering civil ceremonies.  \nThe Entsch Cross Party Bill rejected the idea of extending the exemption to other authorised celebrants: \nIt is not considered appropriate to extend the right to refuse to solemnise marriages to other authorised celebrants. \nUnder the Code of Practice for Marriage Celebrants and existing Commonwealth, State and Territory discrimination \nlegislation, authorised celebrants who are not ministers of religion or chaplains cannot unlawfully discriminate on \nthe grounds of race, age or disability. To allow other authorised celebrants to discriminate on the grounds of a \nperson’s sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status would treat one group of people with a \ncharacteristic that is protected under discrimination legislation differently from other groups of people with \ncharacteristics that are also protected.75 \nReligious groups would presumably support opening up the exemption to all ‘authorised celebrants’, thereby \nensuring that Commonwealth marriage celebrants with a religious belief opposing same-sex marriage would be \nexempt from solemnising same-sex marriage.  The Anglican Church Diocese of Sydney made such a suggestion in \na submission to the 2012 Committee inquiry into the same-sex Bills: \nWe are … aware that in the United Kingdom civil celebrants who are Christian have been forced, due to equality \nlaws and policies, to conduct civil partnership ceremonies for same-sex couples against their own consciences or \nrisk losing their jobs (even though there are few ceremonies for same-sex couples and they are easily covered by \nother celebrants). There is no reason to think the same will not occur in relation to the solemnisation of marriages \ninvolving same-sex couples should they become lawful in the United Kingdom. \nIf a same-sex couple wishes to marry they ought to be required to engage a minister of religion or civil celebrant \nwho is willing to solemnise the marriage.  They should not force a Christian (or other person with conscientious \nobjection) to do so by invoking anti-discrimination laws.  We submit that the protections in section 47 should be \nextended to civil celebrants where the marriage to be solemnised is between persons of the same sex.76 \nObligation on state and territory marriage registrars  \nUnder section 39 of the Marriage Act (Cth) state and territory officers are authorised to solemnise marriages. \nBoth the Leyonhjelm Bill and the Entsch Cross Party Bill amend section 39 to clarify that state and territory \nofficers have obligations to solemnise marriages including same-sex marriages.  \n                                                             \n73.

Anglican Church Diocese of Sydney, op. cit. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 16 \nThe Leyonhjelm Bill provides that state and territory marriage registrars must not refuse to solemnise marriages \nthat are in accordance with the Marriage Act (Cth).77 This provision is based on the premise that authorised \ncelebrants in the employ of the state should not be able to discriminate.78 \nIn the Entsch Cross Party Bill, item 4 amends section 39 to provide that a state and territory marriage registrar \nmust not refuse to solemnise a marriage if the refusal would amount to unlawful discrimination within the \nmeaning of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act (Cth), providing the marriage is otherwise lawful.79 The \neffect of this amendment is similar to the Leyonhjelm Bill in that it would ensure that marriage registrars would \nbe obliged to solemnise same-sex marriage as long as there were no other legal impediments under the \nMarriage Act (Cth). Its effect would also be that ‘people who choose to get married without using a minister of \nreligion, a chaplain or a marriage celebrant can do so without facing unlawful discrimination’.80 \nThis issue has arisen in some overseas jurisdictions including the United Kingdom and Canada where marriage \nregistry office celebrants have declined to solemnise same-sex marriages or civil partnerships on religious \ngrounds. In the United Kingdom a registrar at Islington Borough Council and a Christian was dismissed for \nrefusing to perform same-sex partnership ceremonies. In Ladel v London Borough of Islington, Lord Neuberger \nsaid that under the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 it was ‘simply unlawful’ for Miss Ladel to \nrefuse to perform civil partnerships.81 \nA similar situation arose in Canada. There, the Civil Marriage Act of 2005 permits same-sex marriage and \nprovides a clear exemption for officials of religious bodies. However it was found by a provincial court (the Court \nof Appeal for Saskatchewan) soon after enactment of the 2005 same-sex marriage laws that  a marriage \ncommissioner‘s refusal to solemnize same-sex marriage on the basis of religious beliefs was unlawful.82  \nCrucially, while acknowledging religious freedoms afforded under section 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights \nand Freedom, the Court said that marriage commissioners  \ndo not act as private citizens when they discharge their official duties … they serve as agents of the province.  \nThe Court added, \na system that would make marriage services available according to the personal religious beliefs of commissioners is \nhighly problematic.83 \nDefence Force chaplains \nPart V of the Marriage Act (Cth) allows Defence Force chaplains to solemnise marriages where at least one of \nthe parties is a member of the Defence Force and where this marriage occurs in an overseas country.84 Defence \nForce chaplains are classed as ‘religious celebrants’ so the exemption in section 47 of the Marriage Act (Cth) for \n‘religious celebrants’ will automatically apply.   \nTwo of the Bills include additional provisions affecting chaplains: \n• The Entsch Cross Party Bill adds a further clarifying note to section 81 providing that a chaplain may refuse to \nsolemnise a marriage on the ground that the solemnisation of the marriage would be contrary to the \nchaplain’s beliefs or the chaplain’s understanding of the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of the \nchaplain’s church or faith group.85 This is a clarifying provision only and is legally unnecessary. \n                                                             \n77.

Section 81 provides that a chaplain may refuse to solemnise a marriage on certain grounds. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 17 \n• The Leyonhjelm amendment has a different effect. It provides that any Defence Force chaplain who refuses \nto solemnise a marriage on the basis of conscience is obliged, where it is possible, to provide the couple \nseeking to marry an alternative chaplain who is willing to solemnise the marriage.86  \nExemption for services \nWhile there has been public debate about the rights of wedding service providers such as caterers or florists to \nrefuse services for gay weddings,87 none of the four Bills include provisions that would provide exemptions in \nrelation to providing goods or services for weddings. The Entsch Cross Party Bill explains the rationale for \nrejecting this option: \nIt is not considered appropriate to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to provide an exemption for persons who \ndo not wish to provide goods or services, or make facilities available, in connection with a marriage because the \nmarriage does not involve a union between a man and a woman. \nIt is already unlawful under discrimination legislation for such persons to discriminate on the grounds of a person’s \nsex, sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. It is not considered appropriate to provide an exemption \non this ground in connection with a marriage, when discrimination on this ground is not allowed generally. \nPersons who provide goods or services, or make facilities available, are currently prohibited from discriminating in \nconnection with marriages on various grounds including race, age and disability. These prohibitions have been in \nplace for significant periods of time. Accordingly, it is not considered appropriate to provide an exemption to allow \nfor discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status in relation to \nmarriage.88 \nOther provisions \nObjects clause \nAll four Bills contain an objects clause. Interestingly, the Hanson-Young Bill and the Leyonhjelm Bill are framed in \nbroader terms whereas the Shorten and Entsch Bills are more narrowly defined. \nThe Hanson-Young Bill: \nThe objects of this Act are: \nto remove from the Marriage Act 1961 discrimination against people on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation or \ngender identity; and \nto recognise that freedom of sexual orientation and gender identity are fundamental human rights; and \nto promote acceptance and the celebration of diversity  \nThe Leyonhjelm Bill: \nThe objects of this Act are: \nto ensure the Marriage Act 1961 allows all Australians the  freedom to marry regardless of sex, sexual orientation, \nand gender identity; \nto facilitate less government intervention in private and family life; and   \nto promote freedom of choice and conscience for individual Australians.   \nThe Shorten Bill: \n                                                             \n86.  Proposed subsection 71(3), inserted by item 10, Schedule 1. The Explanatory Memorandum states that the requirement of ‘possibility’ \nrecognises that there may be circumstances where a willing chaplain cannot be arranged (e.g. if the people involved are in a remote \nlocation), as well as circumstances in which other provisions would prevent the marriage being solemnised. \n87.  See p. 22 below. \n88.  Explanatory Memorandum, Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill 2015, accessed 23 August 2015. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 18 \nThe object of this Act is to allow Australians to marry regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or \nintersex status. \nThe Entsch Cross Party Bill: \nThe object of this Act is to allow couples to marry, and to have their marriages recognised, regardless of sex, sexual \norientation, gender identity or intersex status.   \nWording of ceremony \nSections 45(2) and 72(2) of the Marriage Act (Cth) currently provide: \n45 Form of ceremony \n… \n(2) Where a marriage is solemnised by or in the presence of an authorised celebrant, not being a minister of \nreligion, it is sufficient if each of the parties says to the other, in the presence of the authorised celebrant and the \nwitnesses, the words:  \n\"I call upon the persons here present to witness that I, A.B. ( or C.D.), take thee, C.D. ( or A.B.), to be my lawful \nwedded wife ( or husband)\"; or words to that effect. \n72 Form and ceremony of marriage [for members of the Defence Force overseas]  \n… \n(2) Unless, having regard to the form and ceremony of the marriage, the chaplain considers it unnecessary for the \nparties to the marriage to do so, each of the parties shall, in some part of the ceremony and in the presence of the \nchaplain and the witnesses, say to each other the words: \n\"I call upon the persons here present to witness that I, A.B. ( or C.D.), take thee, C.D. ( or A.B.), to be my lawful \nwedded wife ( or husband)\"; or words to that effect. \nThe Shorten and Hansen Young Bills amend subsections 45(2) and 72(2) by inserting the words ‘or partner’ after \nthe words ‘or husband’. The Leyonhjelm Bill and the Entsch Cross Party Bill would insert the words ‘or partner or \nspouse’. The effect of these amendments would mean couples would have the choice of the following words: \n• to be my lawful wedded wife (or husband) (the current wording) \n• to be my lawful wedded partner (the words added by all four Bills) \n• to be my lawful wedded spouse (the additional words in the Leyonhjelm Bill and the Entsch Cross Party Bill).  \nIt has been suggested that it can be implied through the phrase ‘or words to that effect’ that ‘a partner’ or \n‘spouse’ is covered by these subsections, and that therefore, the proposed amendments to sections 45(2) and \n72(2) are unnecessary.89 \nMarriage ceremony \nThe words to be spoken by an authorised marriage celebrant (other than ministers of religions) would be \nchanged by all four Bills to be: \nMarriage, according to law in Australia, is the union of two people (or 2 people) to the exclusion of all others, \nvoluntarily entered into for life.90 \n                                                             \n89.

Importantly plebiscites are normally advisory, and do not compel a government to act on the \noutcome. Normally the conduct of a national plebiscite would be established by a special Act of Parliament or by \nregulation. The enabling Act for the plebiscite would set out the purpose of the plebiscite and enable a vote to \nbe conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. The Act may or may not specify any actions expected of \nthe government as a result of the plebiscite. It may also specify whether voting will be compulsory or voluntary \nand set out the rules for approval (that is whether it is 50 percent of the vote or a greater number). Ideally it \nshould specify the question but as election analyst Anthony Green suggests, specifying the question to do with \nsame-sex marriage could be controversial: \nShould the question ask about restricting marriage to opposite sexes, or specifiy that same-sex marriage be \nallowed? Should it ask a de-gendered question such as whether marriage should be between two persons? How \nabout marriage should be restricted to its traditional meaning between a man and a woman?  Even the horrible \"Do \nyou agree to an act to amend the definition of Marriage?\" There is much scope for using the words to tilt the result \none way or the other.92 \nElection analyst Anthony Green also notes that it would be unlikely that changes to the Marriage Act (Cth) would \nbe dependent on the plebiscite. ‘The Parliament would still have to legislate the changes and would presumably \ndo so dependent on the plebiscite result.’93 \n There have only been three national plebiscites in Australia: \n• 1916: military service conscription (defeated)  \n• 1917: reinforcement of the Australian Imperial Force overseas (defeated) \n• 1977: choice of Australia’s national anthem ('Advance Australia Fair' preferred.)  \nPlebiscites have been used by state governments from time to time, especially to deal with social issues, such as \nhotel trading hours or daylight saving. \nWhile the kind of direct democracy implied by a plebiscite has its merits, there is debate as to whether it is the \nbest way to resolve an issue. Australia is a representative democracy, and as such, a feature of parliamentary \nrepresentative government is that laws and major policy proposals are determined by elected representatives \nthrough debate and deliberation in the parliament. As constitutional lawyer Professor George Williams \nexplained in 2011 in relation to a proposed plebiscite on carbon tax: \n‘Plebiscites are rare in Australia. They go against the grain of a system in which we elect parliamentarians to make \ndecisions on our behalf. By contrast, referendums and plebiscites introduce an element of direct democracy that \nallows people to have a say. \n… \n…plebiscites bind no one and make no change to the law. In effect, they are an expensive opinion poll. While \nplebiscites have no legal effect, they can have a major political impact. They can provide a government with a \nmandate to proceed with a divisive policy, and can help to resolve a polarised issue when a government is unwilling \n                                                             \n91.

Ibid. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 20 \nto make a call. A government lacking the courage to undertake a major reform may decide to do so when backed by \nthe support of the people in a plebiscite.94 \nReferendums and plebiscites are different types of ballot. While both entail a vote by Australia’s electors, a \nreferendum is a vote to change the Australian Constitution and the outcome is binding.  If the electors vote yes, \nand the Governor General gives Royal Assent, then the Constitution is actually changed. The rules for \nreferendums are set out in section 128 of the Constitution.  For a referendum proposal to succeed at federal \nlevel it must obtain a ‘double majority’, meaning it must win the majority of votes nationally and also win in a \nmajority of the states (four out of six states). Since Federation there have been 44 proposals for constitutional \nchange put to Australian electors at referendums. Only eight have been approved. The last successful national \nreferendum was in 1977 when Australians voted to, among other things, set a retirement age of 70 for High \nCourt judges. Each national referendum since then has failed. \nA referendum to decide the Commonwealth’s power over same-sex marriage is not necessary. The High Court \nhas already determined in the Same-sex marriage case that the federal Parliament has the power to legislate on \nthis topic. \nThe proposal for a referendum has not taken a clear form. However, if the proposal were to give the \nCommonwealth power to restrict the right of the Parliament to legislate on same-sex marriage, it would be \nunlikely to succeed. Obtaining a majority of votes nationally and a majority in four states would be a high hurdle. \nIn the unlikely event that such a referendum were successful then state and territory powers in this area  would \nquite likely be revived and same sex marriage laws at state and territory level would again become a real \npossibility.95  \nFor opponents of same-sex marriage, it would be easier to defeat a plebiscite on same-sex marriage than it \nwould be to pass a referendum constitutionally ruling out same-sex marriage.96  \nViews \nImmediate reaction to the proposal for a popular vote has been mixed including within the Coalition. Prime \nMinister Abbott, in arguing in support of a popular vote said: ‘this [matter] in the end is so personal, so sensitive, \nso intimate, if you like, that it really should be decided by people rather than by Parliament’.97  Those supporting \nthe existing definition of marriage would appear to generally agree with the Prime Minister. Minister Scott \nMorrison has come out strongly in favour of a referendum,98 a view criticised by the Attorney-General who \nargues a referendum is ‘totally unnecessary’ and that a plebiscite would be the only practical method of popular \nvote on this issue.99  Malcolm Turnbull, who has consistently supported a conscience vote, showed some \ndisappointment saying that a plebiscite planned so far in advance will unnecessarily place the matter in the \npublic arena from now until after the next election.100 \nThe Opposition see it as a delaying tactic also pointing to its substantial cost and its potential for divisiveness.101 \nOthers question the reasoning for postponing until after next election and want more detail on the format that \nwould be adopted.  Greens Leader Senator Di Natale says that if there is to be a popular vote it must be a \nplebiscite held at the next election and the question must to be drafted by Parliament rather than the \nGovernment.102 Following that announcement, Greens Senator Rice introduced a cross party Bill103 and \n                                                             \n94.

Marriage Equality Plebiscite Bill 2015, accessed 28 August 2015. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 21 \nsubsequently moved that a reference be given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References \nCommittee on the matter of a popular vote, the reporting date for the Committee being 16 September 2015.104 \nMarriage equality versus religious freedom \nThe numerous parliamentary committee inquiries into same-sex marriage legislation, have canvassed at great \nlength the various arguments for and against same-sex marriage and the relevant committee reports provide an \nexcellent summary of those arguments. The views put to the 2009 Committee inquiry were summarised in the \nprevious Parliamentary Library Background note and that summary still provides an accurate reflection of views \non both sides of the debate.105 \nHowever since those Committee inquiries, the emphasis of the debate appears to have shifted with a strong \nfocus moving to questions regarding religious freedoms. A central question now being debated is how far \nreligious exemptions should extend for those who are morally opposed to same-sex marriage on the basis of \ntheir religious beliefs and whether an exemption should be offered to those opposed on non-religious grounds. \nThere is general agreement by those engaged with this debate that any change to the law should accommodate \nreligious celebrants who would not celebrate gay weddings and as the analysis above indicates, all four Bills \ncurrently before the Parliament make some provision to protect the right of refusal by religious celebrants. \nHowever for some, protection of religious freedom goes beyond the rights of religious celebrants to choose who \nthey should and should not marry.  Religious groups raising concerns about same-sex marriage also seek \nassurances about: \n• the rights of all celebrants, not just religious celebrants, to decline gay weddings on the basis of a religious or \nconscientious conviction  \n• the rights of wedding service providers to decline request for service from gay couples on the basis of a \nreligious conviction \n• the rights of religious schools to organise their employment and enrolment policies and their curriculum \ncontent based on their teaching on marriage and   \n• the rights of health and welfare agencies to make decisions and run their affairs according to their religious \nprinciples.106 \nIn relation to marriage celebrants, one suggestion has been to extend the exemption that currently applies for \nreligious celebrants to cover all authorised civil celebrants. As noted above the Leyonhjelm Bill does this to some \nextent, providing an exemption for authorised celebrants based on conscience. However that Bill excludes from \nthe exemption state and territory marriage registrars, the rationale being that authorised celebrants in the \nemploy of the state should not be able to discriminate.107  \nAs noted above, the Entsch Cross Party Bill rejected the idea of extending the religious exemption to other \nauthorised celebrants.108  \nThe rights of wedding service providers (such as caterers and florists) have been a subject of concern in overseas \njurisdictions considering same-sex marriage. Of the 13 states in the United States that legislated to legalise \nsame-sex marriage a number also provided special exemptions for marriage service providers. For example in \nthe state of Connecticut the law provides:  \n…a religious organization, association or society, or any nonprofit institution or organization operated, supervised or \ncontrolled by or in conjunction with a religious organization, association or society, shall not be required to provide \nservices, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods or privileges to an individual if the request … is related to \n                                                             \n104.

Explanatory Memorandum, Freedom to Marry Bill 2014, accessed 23 August 2015. \n108.  The Explanatory Memorandum argues that to allow authorised celebrants to discriminate on the grounds of a person’s sex, sexual \norientation, gender identity or intersex status would treat one group of people with a characteristic that is protected under discrimination \nlegislation differently from other groups of people with characteristics that are also protected; Explanatory Memorandum, Marriage \nLegislation Amendment Bill 2015, accessed 28 August 2015. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 22 \nthe solemnization of a marriage or celebration of a marriage and such solemnization or celebration is in violation of \ntheir religious beliefs and faith.109 \nSome would say that such an exemption would need to have limits. For example, if a florist or wedding venue \nprovider wished to exclude gay marriage business they would need to advertise their services as such.110 The \ntrade-off would be that if a person believes marriage is a religious tradition they would have to accept that ‘the \nmarket will be narrowed for them to fulfil the purity of their conscience, unless they want to fall foul of anti-\ndiscrimination law’.111 This may be a marginal issue. Furthermore, providers of wedding services may already \nhave had to address these types of issues in the past when previous changes in marriage practice may have \nconflicted with their religious beliefs. It may be that ‘the market will work itself out’ with the likelihood of \nconflict over this issue being fairly remote. \nIn relation to the concern regarding the rights of religious institutions and the possibility that education \ninstitutions could be forced to teach and recruit in conflict with their views about marriage, it may be that these \nissues are already addressed. There are already some protections available which operate to protect their \nreligious freedoms with regard to teachings on sex and sexual relationships which would also encompass \nteachings about marriage. For example at federal level the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 provides that, in general, \nprohibitions notwithstanding, it is not unlawful for an education institution that is conducted in accordance with \nthe doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed to discriminate against another person \n‘on the ground of the other person’s marital status or pregnancy in connection with the provision of education \nor training if the discrimination occurs ‘in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of \nadherents of that religion or creed’.112  \nSimilarly, at state and territory level there are various exceptions provided in anti-discrimination laws that \nprovide exemptions for religious educational institutions, although these do vary from state to state.113 It would \nappear that religious beliefs concerning the meaning of marriage could be encompassed by some of these \nexemptions in the same way that beliefs about de-facto heterosexual and same-sex relationships are already \nprotected.  \nAustralian Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson has contributed to this debate. He supports civil same-sex \nmarriage but argues the human right of religious freedom is equally important.114 Quoting former Prime \nMinister John Gorton debating the introduction of the Marriage Act in 1961 the Commissioner states ‘marriage, \nof course, can mean a number of things … it can mean a religious ceremony; it can mean a civil ceremony; and it \ncan mean a form of living together. The Commissioner continues: \nSo long as we pardon the pun, marry all these traditions in one institution there will be angst about the nature of \nthe law. If the law excludes same-sex couples, there will be injustice. If people of faith are forced to act against their \nconscience, their human rights will also be breached.115 \nCommissioner Wilson’s solution would be to separate the civil and religious traditions of marriage but treat \nthem equally in law. The Marriage Act would recognise civil marriages. A civil marriage would be defined as a \nunion between two people voluntarily entered into for life and could be solemnised by a licensed civil celebrant. \nThe Act would also recognise religious marriages in different religious traditions in a different section of the \ntext.116 \nThere are international examples where this has occurred, in particular the United Kingdom and South Africa, \nalthough arguably, the circumstances in those countries differ to the Australian setting. In the case of the United \n                                                             \n109.

It has been suggested it was an \ninelegant and imperfect solution but revolutionary for its time and place.118 \nMarriage equality campaigner Rodney Croome is critical of both the Wilson proposal and any suggestion that \nsame-sex marriage would be an assault on religious freedom.119  \nI have no doubt Tim Wilson is sincere in his desire to find a path forward on marriage equality, but talking up the \nneed to protect religious freedoms when they are not actually under attack opens a Pandora’s box.  \nIt feeds the narrative of opponents of marriage equality that the reform should be opposed because of a plethora of \nso called “unintended consequences”, when there is no real basis for these fears at all. \nIt jeopardises bipartisan support for marriage equality legislation, given strong Labor, Green and crossbench \nsupport for the principles of antidiscrimination. It provides those conservatives who want to delay marriage equality \nwith just the excuse they need: there are serious consequences to this reform that require the kind of careful \nconsideration and detailed legislative drafting that will take many months.120 \nConclusion \nAs the Paper has observed, Australia has achieved a high degree of equality between the treatment of same-sex \nand heterosexual relationships with marriage remaining the one significant area of difference. For some, it is \nimportant to take time to ponder and consider the full implications of changing the meaning of this long \nestablished and important institution.  For others, including those who live with the memories and scars of the \ncriminalisation and prejudice endured by homosexuals in the past, it is important to move swiftly to remove this \nlast remaining area of difference. Overseas experience would suggest that a long and protracted discussion \nabout the meaning of marriage, leading up to a popular vote some 18 months away, is likely to bring a \npassionate, robust and even strident or divisive debate within the Australian community. \n \n  \n                                                             \n117.

Ibid. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 24 \nAppendix 1—International developments \nTo date, 21 countries allow same-sex marriage. These include Canada, South Africa, Argentina, the United States, \nBelgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United \nKingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Two countries, Finland and Slovenia have \nlegislation allowing same-sex marriage which is yet to come into force.  In Ireland, which recently had a \nreferendum supporting same-sex marriage, legislation is yet to be introduced and passed by the Parliament. \nThis paper is selective and focuses on same-sex marriage legislation that has been introduced in countries with a \nsimilar common law tradition to Australia—namely Canada, South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom \nand New Zealand although it is also acknowledged that some of these countries have a different constitutional \nframework that includes an entrenched charters of rights. The paper also contains information on developments \nin France. While France’s legal system is based on a civil code rather than common law, the paper covers that \njurisdiction due to recent interest by some Australian politicians who have suggested the French model may be \nan appropriate model for Australia to follow.121  \nCanada \nThe legislation that permits same-sex marriages in Canada is the Civil Marriage Act 2005 (CAN)  introduced into \nParliament on 1 February 2005 and assented to on 20 July 2005.122 Some Canadian provinces and territories had \nallowed same-sex marriages to take place from as early as 2001, however these marriages were said to exist in \nan ‘interim legal capacity’ given that the federal Canadian Government had not yet enacted legislation for same-\nsex marriage.123 \nPrior to enactment of the Civil Marriage Act, the federal Government referred a number of questions relating to \nthe legislation to the Supreme Court of Canada. These questions concerned the legislative authority of the \nfederal Parliament to make such a law and to its consistency with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \n(Charter). In response, the Court confirmed that the federal Canadian Government had exclusive authority to \namend the definition of marriage so that it included same-sex marriage. In addition to this, the Supreme Court \nnoted that the right to freedom of religion protected under the Charter afforded religious institutions the right \nto refuse to perform same-sex marriages if they felt such marriages conflicted with their religious beliefs.124 \nIn its preamble, the Civil Marriage Act states that it is only by allowing same-sex couples to equally access the \ninstitution of marriage that their rights to equality without discrimination can be respected. It also acknowledges \nthat the availability of civil unions, instead of marriage, does not offer same-sex couples the equality they are \nentitled to. \nUnder section 2 of the Civil Marriage Act, marriage, for civil purposes, is defined as: \n…the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.  \nSection 4 provides further clarity stating: \nFor greater certainty, a marriage is not void or voidable by reason only that the spouses are of the same sex. \nThe Law Council of Australia, in a submission to the 2012 Committee inquiry into the same-sex Bills had \nrecommended that the Canadian definition was an appropriate model for Australia’s Marriage Act, noting the \ndefinition is simple and gender-neutral, broad and inclusive and at the same time, ‘the definition respects the \ncommon law understanding of marriage as being a monogamous union.’125  \nFreedom of Religion  \nThe Civil Marriage Act explicitly provides for the freedom of religion for churches and religious groups. Under the \nAct it is recognized that officials of religious groups are free to refuse to perform marriages that are not in \naccordance with the religious views of their respective faiths. Section 3 states: \n                                                             \n121.  ‘Ministers tied in knots over same-sex union’, Sydney Morning Herald, 13 June 2015, accessed 27 August 2015. \n122.

Ibid. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 25 \nIt is recognized that officials of religious groups are free to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance \nwith their religious beliefs. \nSection 3.1 provides further protection based on freedom of conscience and religion stating: \nFor greater certainty, no person or organization shall be deprived of any benefit, or be subject to any obligation or \nsanction, under any law of the Parliament of Canada solely by reason of their exercise, in respect of marriage \nbetween persons of the same sex, of the freedom of conscience and religion guaranteed under the Canadian \nCharter of Rights and Freedoms or the expression of their beliefs in respect of marriage as the union of a man and \nwoman to the exclusion of all others based on that guaranteed freedom. \nIn relation to protection of religious groups, it is of note that section 3 is similar to section 47 of the Australian \nMarriage Act (Cth) in that it provides officials of religious groups the discretion to refuse to perform marriages \nthat are not in accordance with their religious beliefs. The Canadian Act contains an additional protection in \nsection 3.1, which effectively acknowledges the rights of religious officials to freedom of religion and freedom of \nconscience if they choose not to perform same-sex marriages. In contrast, the Marriage Act (Cth) does not \nexplicitly safeguard any particular rights of authorised celebrants who refuse to perform marriages. The Law \nCouncil has suggested that such a protection could be considered for inclusion in the Marriage Act (Cth).126 \nSoon after the enactment of the Civil Marriage Act (CAN) the focus in Canada shifted back to the provincial level, \nwith some marriage commissioners in Saskatchewan and other parts of the country refusing to solemnize same-\nsex marriages on religious grounds.127 Further to this, In the Matter of Marriage Commissioners Appointed Under \nthe Marriage Act 1995128 the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan held that that a marriage commissioner‘s refusal \nto solemnize same-sex marriage on the basis of religious beliefs is unlawful.129  \nThe Court concluded that the proposed amendments to the Saskatchewan Marriage Act 1995 (that is the \namendments that would have allowed an exemption for marriage commissioners) would be contrary to section \n15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and, if enacted, ‘would violate the equality rights of gay \nand lesbian individuals’.130 \nCrucially, while acknowledging religious freedoms afforded under s 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and \nFreedom, the Court said that marriage commissioners  \n… do not act as private citizens when they discharge their official duties … they serve as agents of the province‘. The \nCourt added, ‘a system that would make marriage services available according to the personal religious beliefs of \ncommissioners is highly problematic’ …131 \nAs such, the Court concluded that the positive effects of the amendments did not outweigh their deleterious \neffects and did not curtail equality rights in a way that was justifiable: \nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly confirmed that freedom of religion is not absolute and that, in appropriate \ncases, it is subject to limitation. This is clearly one of those situations where religious freedom must yield to the \nlarger public interest.132 \nSouth Africa \nSame-sex marriages in South Africa are permitted under the Civil Union Act 2006 (SOU),133 which received assent \non 29 November 2006. Marriages in South Africa are legislated for under two different Acts. The Marriage Act \n1961  (SOU)134 applies to marriages between members of the opposite-sex. The Civil Union Act applies to both \nsame-sex marriages and marriages between opposite-sex couples. \n                                                             \n126.  Ibid. \n127.

The couple argued that the common law \ndefinition of marriage and the Marriage Act (SOU) excluded same-sex couples and therefore discriminated \nagainst them on the basis of their sexual orientation. They argued that this discrimination breached their \nConstitutional rights to equality and dignity.136 \nIn a unanimous decision, the Constitutional Court held that, to the extent that the common-law definition of \nmarriage and the Marriage Act (SOU) excluded same-sex couples from marriage, they were unfairly \ndiscriminatory. Accordingly, they were unconstitutional and invalid.137 \nThe Court determined that the remedy should be the issuing of a declaration of inconsistency, which was to be \nsuspended for 12 months to give Parliament time to address the unconstitutional exclusion of same-sex couples.   \nThe Parliament responded to the declaration of inconsistency by enacting the Civil Union Act (SOU) rather than \namending the traditional Marriage Act (SOU).138 \nThe Civil Union Act (SOU) reiterates the rights that are protected by the Constitution of the Republic of South \nAfrica such as the right to equality before the law; the right to equal protection and benefit of the law; the right \nto freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion; and protection from unfair discrimination on \nbehalf of the state on a number of grounds including gender, sex, and sexual orientation.139 \n‘Marriage’ is not explicitly defined in the Civil Union Act (SOU). Instead, ‘civil union’ is defined to mean: \n…the voluntary union of two persons who are both 18 years of age or older, which is solemnised and registered by \nway of either a marriage or a civil partnership, in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this Act to the \nexclusion, while it lasts, of all others.140 \nSame-sex couples who wish to marry under the Civil Union Act (SOU) are able to choose whether they would like \ntheir union to be registered as a marriage or a civil partnership. Regardless of the union that is selected, the legal \nrights that attach to marriage under the Marriage Act (SOU) also attach to unions under the Civil Union Act \n(SOU). This is explicitly stated in section 13 of the Civil Union Act (SOU).141 \nThe Act also prescribes the formal requirements for entering into such a civil union marriage and in many ways \nmirrors the provision of the Marriage Act (SOU), which was not repealed or amended and remained open \nexclusively to facilitate marriage by heterosexual couples who chose not to get married in terms of the new \nAct.142  \nThe Civil Union Act (SOU) also contains a provision which allows a marriage officer to object to solemnising a \nsame-sex civil partnership or marriage on the grounds of conscience, religion and belief.143 \nThe Law Council in an earlier submission suggested that the South African Civil Union Act could be considered by \nthe Committee in addition to the Canadian Civil Union Act as possible models for same-sex marriage legislation \nin Australia.144  \nDe Vos argues that the Civil Union Act (SOU) is in many ways an inelegant and imperfect solution and has \ncreated technical anomalies in relation to the rules regarding who can perform marriages under the traditional \nMarriage Act (SOU) and who can perform marriages under the Civil Union Act (SOU).145 \nDe Vos concludes: \n                                                             \n135.

P de Vos, op. cit., p. 173. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 27 \nIn many ways the compromise reached by Parliament – by adopting a separate Civil Union Act that nevertheless \nextends full marriage rights to all qualifying same-sex and different sex couples – is an inelegant one. It has \nunnecessarily complicated South Africa’s family law regime by providing heterosexual couples with a choice to \nmarry under the old or the new Act while providing same-sex couples only with the option of entering into a \nmarriage or a civil partnership under the Civil Union Act.  \n… \nAt the same time it might be argued that the compromise reached by a democratically elected Parliament bestows \nthe kind of legitimacy on same-sex relationships that would have been unthinkable only ten short years ago. Given \nthe fact that South Africa is not a developed country and given, moreover, that attitudes towards same-sex desire \namongst ordinary South Africans can hardly be described as enlightened, the adoption of legislation that now allows \nsame-sex couples the choice of entering into a marriage seems little short of revolutionary.146 \nUnited Kingdom \nLegislation permitting same-sex marriage in England and Wales (the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013) \ncommenced on 29 March 2014 and in Scotland (the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014) \ncommenced on 16 December 2014. \nThis paper considers only the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act (UK).147 \nThe Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act (UK) (or the ‘new Act’) includes provision amongst other things for: \n• civil marriage of same-sex couples \n• religious marriage of same-sex couples, where the religious organisation wishes to conduct such marriages, \nthat is where the organisation has ‘opted in’ \n• protection for religious bodies and individuals who do not wish to conduct marriage ceremonies for same-sex \ncouples \n• exclusion of the Church of England and the Church of Wales from performing same-sex marriages \n• conversion of civil partnerships to marriage and  \n• enabling transsexual people to change their legal gender without necessarily having to end their existing \nmarriage.  \nThe Marriage Act 1949 (UK)  (which remains in operation) does not define marriage as between a man and a \nwoman, but sets out the procedure and premises where a marriage may take place.148 The new Act therefore \ndoes not define marriage but simply states: \n‘Marriage of same sex couples is lawful’. \nReligious protections \nClergy of the Church of England or Church in Wales are not permitted to solemnise marriage of same-sex \ncouples according to their rites. The new Act provides specifically that Canon law of the Church of England is not \ncontrary to the general law which enables same-sex couples to marry, by virtue of providing only for marriage of \nopposite sex couples (as Canon B30 does).149 Same-sex couples do not have the right to have their marriages \nsolemnized by clergy of the Church of England or Church in Wales. \nOther denominations and religions  \n                                                             \n146.

The new statutory definition of marriage in the Marriage \nAct defines marriage as ‘the union of 2 people, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.’ \nThe Marriage Act (NZ) had previously authorised but did not oblige any marriage celebrant to solemnise a \nmarriage. This is further reinforced by the new law which states that no religious or organisational celebrant is \nobliged to solemnise a marriage that would contravene religious beliefs or philosophical or humanitarian \nconvictions of a religious body or approved organisation. Relevantly section 29 provides: \n(1) A marriage licence shall authorise but not oblige any marriage celebrant to solemnise the marriage to which it \nrelates.  \n                                                             \n150.  An opt-in activity is listed in a table. The Government’s Explanatory Notes summarise the list as meaning ‘the various types of activity relating \nto the decision of a religious organisation to opt-in to solemnizing marriage for same sex couples’. Opt-in activities would include, for \nexample, applying for the registration of a building. Ibid., p. 44. \n151.

Marriage Act 1955 (NZ), accessed 27 August 2015. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 29 \n(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), no celebrant who is a minister of religion recognised by a \nreligious body enumerated in Schedule 1, and no celebrant who is a person nominated to solemnise marriages by \nan approved organisation, is obliged to solemnise a marriage if solemnising that marriage would contravene the \nreligious beliefs of the religious body or the religious beliefs or philosophical or humanitarian convictions of the \napproved organisation. \nNew Zealand academic Rex Ahdar argues that the exemption for celebrants is not worded widely enough and \nwould like the exemption to cover independent marriage celebrants.153 \nFirst, marriage celebrants who are \"independent\", that is, not members of any of the listed religious bodies, or any \napproved organisation, are not protected. Yet some 45 percent of marriages are conducted by these independent \ncelebrants (23 percent are conducted by registrars at a state registry office and 32 percent by a church or approved \norganisation marriage celebrant). Independent marriage celebrants are persons that \"will conscientiously perform \nthe duties of a marriage celebrant\" and \"it is in the interests of the public generally, or of a particular community \n(whether defined by geography, interest, belief, or some other factor) \"that they be so appointed (Marriage Act \n1955, s 11 (3) (a) (b)). \nSuch persons may well have beliefs that generate a conscientious objection to SSM. It was wrong then, for the \nMinistry of Justice to recommend that independent celebrants be excluded from the benefit of the conscientious \nobjection exemption in s 29(2). The Ministry's argument was that, in contrast to ministers of religion, independent \ncelebrants (and registrars) are appointed by the government \"to perform a public function, not to promote their \nown religious or personal beliefs”.154 \nAhdar also cites the example of the Anglican Church where it may eventually be decided that solemnisation of \nsame-sex marriage is allowed. If that happened, Ahbar argues that Anglican clergy who dissent from that official \nline ought to be protected.  \nThe right of religious freedom protects all who practice that faith, not just for the \"orthodox\" or those who happen \nto abide by the views of the majority of co-religionists or the pronouncements of the ecclesiastical or ruling elite. \nAppellate courts have acknowledged this (see eg R (Williamson) v Secretary of State for Education and Employment \n[2005] UKHL 15; [2005] 2 AC 246; [2005] 2 All ER 1 at [22]). In light of this I proposed an amendment to s 29(2): \nWithout limiting the generality of subsection (1), no celebrant who is a minister of religion recognised by a religious \nbody enumerated in Schedule 1, and no celebrant who is a person nominated to solemnize marriages by an \napproved organisation, is obliged to solemnize a marriage if solemnizing that marriage would contravene the \nreligious beliefs of that celebrant.  \nBut this change was not adopted. So, for now, the position of conservative church ministers within the mainstream \nProtestant denominations remains precarious.155 \nUnited States \nUnder the US Constitution, states have the marriage law-making power. \nDuring the period from 2003 to 2015, 13 states and the District of Columbia legislated to permit same-sex \nmarriage with all providing some form of religious exemption in regard to marriage. In that period same-sex \nmarriage was also legalised in a number of other states, brought about through court decisions including state \nbased challenges to bans against same-sex marriage.156   \n                                                             \n153.

The appellants had been successful in challenging the bans in their respective District Courts but those \ndecisions were reversed at the Sixth Circuit. On appeal, the majority of justices of the US Supreme Court \nquashed the decision of the Sixth Circuit. The Court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex \ncouples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the Due Process \nand the Equal Protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe Fourteenth Amendment relevantly states: \nSection 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of \nthe United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge \nthe privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or \nproperty, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \nThe decision has generated significant ‘international celebration, condemnation, and critique’.158  In Australia, it \nwas a major impetus for the renewed debate on same-sex marriage with advocates announcing an intention to \nbring further legislation before the Parliament to bring Australia in line with overseas developments.159 \nThe Court’s decision and judicial reasoning has been questioned in legal circles, Father Frank Brennan observing: \nThere is much about the judicial reasoning in the case that would raise eyebrows among lawyers not used to the \njudicial activism of the liberal majority of the US Supreme Court which has long viewed the due process and equal \nprotection clauses as a vehicle for legislating their preferred view on contested political and social issues.160 \nOther commentators suggest the outcome is not surprising noting that Obergefell is a part of a judicial path that \nhad helped facilitate the recognition of gay and lesbian civil rights in the United States.161 However as Raj and \nothers have also noted, what is striking about the judgment is the mix of sentimentality and optimism that \nunderscores the constitutional analysis. Much of the majority's opinion, delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy, \nevokes visions of liberty, equality, and dignity.162 In delivering the opinion of the court, Justice Kennedy points to \nthe ‘transcendent importance of marriage’, his concluding and somewhat poetic statement is now often quoted:  \nNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and \nfamily. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the \npetitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would \nmisunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect \nit, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live \nin loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. \nThe Constitution grants them that right.163 \nIn a passionate dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts critiques the majority for imposing their ‘will’ upon the \nConstitution, ignoring precedent, and taking the issue away from legislatures or voters to decide on: \n                                                             \n157.

Under \nthe Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be.164 \nSimilarly Justice Scalia also in dissent observed: \n'Until the courts put a stop to it, public debate over same-sex marriage displayed American democracy at its best. \nIndividuals on both sides of the issue passionately, but respectfully, attempted to persuade their fellow citizens to \naccept their views.165 \nAnother of the four dissenters, Justice Alito highlighted the perils of a broad-brush judicial determination \nconstitutionalising the right of same-sex marriage and short-circuiting the more nuanced debates which could go \non in parliaments. He highlighted that the decision will 'be used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent \nto the new orthodoxy,’ pointing out that the majority 'compares traditional marriage laws to laws that denied \nequal treatment for African-Americans and women’.166 \nFurther analysis of this case is beyond the scope of this paper, other than to say that commentators have seen \nflaws in the legal reasoning of both the majority and the dissenting judgments. The majority, for not focusing on \nlegal issues and instead delivering a ‘moving and elegant ‘essay on the joys and virtues of marriage, and the pain \nthat gay couples and their children face when they cannot marry. The dissenters, for both studiously ignoring \nrecent relevant precedents and for the more serious failure of not addressing the question of whether states can \nrefuse to recognise same-sex marriages that are valid where they are celebrated. To commentator  Richard \nLempert the failure to address the marriage recognition issue was bizarre:  \nEven if states need not allow same sex couples to marry, which is the dissenters’ position, it does not follow that \nthey can refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of marriages validly celebrated elsewhere. The issue poses special \nproblems for the dissenters. The argument at the core of most dissents is that the Court’s majority has unwisely and \ninappropriately taken upon itself to decide a question that is for the people to resolve through normal democratic \nprocesses. Justice Scalia was perhaps the bluntest in making this point. He opened his dissent by saying that he \nwrote separately “to call attention to the Court’s threat to American democracy.” The same theme was sounded in \neach of the other dissents, sometimes in language almost as strident as Scalia’s. \n… \nThey should either have labeled their opinions “dissenting in part” and agreed with the majority’s holding on the \nrecognition issue, or they should have indicated and justified their disagreement with both issues the case posed. \nBut addressing the recognition issue would, on the one hand, have meant agreeing to require states to recognize \nsome same sex marriages, or, on the other hand, acknowledging that they were choosing between the rules of two \nstate electorates with little more to justify their choice than their personal preferences. I expect the dissenters \nfound the first option unacceptable because they wanted no part in the legalization of same sex marriage, while the \nsecond option would have meant that the democratic high road they claimed to be defending was no longer \navailable. They could escape the dilemma only by ignoring their obligation to speak to an issue they had agreed to \nreview. This is the path they followed. It allowed them to wage war with the majority’s opinion on their own \nterms167 \nLegal academic Father Frank Brennan suggests that it is regrettable that the Supreme Court took it upon itself to \ndiscover a definitive answer in the silent Constitution on this contested social question of same-sex marriage, \nbecause ‘there can be no doubt that the democratic process was taking US society in only one direction on the \nissue’: \nThe court, by intervening and deciding the issue unilaterally, has reduced the prospects of community acceptance \nand community compromise about the freedom of religious practice of those who cannot embrace same-sex \nmarriage for religious reasons. Alito is right when he assumes 'that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to \n                                                             \n164.  Ibid., p. 2. \n165.  Ibid., p. 3. \n166.

It will all be nasty and hard fought.168 \nRaj questions the majority reasoning on other grounds suggesting that marriage has not necessarily been ‘the \ndestiny’ or final outcome for gay rights as the Court suggested and that the high elevation of marriage raises \nbroader questions about relationship and sexual equality: \nUltimately, marriage reform generates claims for love, equality, and dignity. Such principles are powerful and \nimportant to protect. However, as marriage equality jurisprudence reflects on the evolving regulation of marriage, \nand the push for social acceptance more broadly, we should also be wary of claims that inadvertently exclude \nothers. No one should have to get married in order to have their relationship respected or to access support from \nthe state. Love and family find expression in disparate ways.169 \nRaj thoughtfully concludes: \nIt would also be parochial to assume that marriage equality will eliminate the violence, harassment, and \ndiscrimination that sexual and gender minorities are subjected to on a daily basis. \nSo, feel free to wash your Facebook profile pictures in rainbow filters and campaign for marriage equality, but \nremember that the push for social justice goes well beyond that.170 \nFrance  \nSame-sex marriage has been legal in France since 2013. The legislation allowing same sex marriage was marked \nby fierce debate in parliament, legal challenges and massive street protests before it became law on 17 May \n2013.171 \nThe new law provides that marriage is contracted by two persons of different sex or the same-sex who have \nreached the age of 18. Adoption by same-sex couples is also recognised under these laws in France.172  \nAs part of its official separation of church and state, French law recognises only the civil marriage. This must be \nperformed by a French Civil Authority which includes the mayor or his legally authorised replacement, the \ndeputy mayor or a city councillor. In France, religious marriage ceremonies are optional, have no legal status and \nmay only be held after the civil ceremony has taken place (which can, but need not be, on the same day). For \nthis reason, the new same-sex marriage law affects only civil marriages. It does not make provision for \naccommodating religious celebrants or protecting religious freedoms. Furthermore there is no provision for \nmarriage registrars to opt out of conducting same-sex marriages on the ground that it goes against their \nreligious or moral belief. \nFollowing passage of the legislation introducing same-sex marriage, a challenge was brought before the Conseil \nConstitutionnel (constitutional court) by a group of mayors opposed to same-sex marriage.  They argued that the \nlaw should have included a ‘freedom of conscience’ clause, giving marriage officials the right not to carry out \nsame-sex marriages if it conflicts with their personal religious or moral beliefs. Their claim was that the lack of \nsuch a clause in the law is contrary to the French constitution.   \nThe Constitutional Court in its judgment rejected this claim and held that it was not unconstitutional for public \nofficials to be required to officiate at same-sex marriages regardless of any personal objections.  \nThe Court noted that the government did not include an opt-out clause within the legislation ‘to assure the law \nis applied by its agents and to guarantee the proper functioning and neutrality of public service,’ ‘Freedom of \nconscience is not violated by officiating at weddings,’ the Court said.173 \n                                                             \n168.

Note that due to different legal system and languages, the information regarding France is mainly from secondary sources. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 33 \nSince 1999 France has also permitted civil unions or civil solidarity pacts (pacte civil de solidarité, or PACS). This is \na contractual form of civil union between two adults (same-sex or opposite-sex) for organising their joint life. It \nbrings rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage.174 Initially introduced to provide legal recognition for \nsame-sex relationships, PACS also became popular with heterosexual couples.  \nAppendix 2—Alternative forms of relationship recognition in Australia \nApart from marriage, legal recognition of relationships can be categorised in three ways: \n• Presumptive de facto recognition \n• Relationship registration and \n• Civil unions. \nPresumptive de facto recognition \nIn a process begun in the 1980s, de facto relationships have gradually been afforded similar rights to married \nrelationships under Australian law.175 Initially these rights were afforded to heterosexual relationships, however \nover the past 10 years this recognition has moved further, with Australia witnessing an incremental blurring of \nthe distinction between the legal rights of same-sex and opposite-sex couples living together in a genuine de \nfacto relationship.176  \nThese changes were initially evident on a state and territory level, where sustained reform programs were \nembarked upon.177 New South Wales was the first state to implement comprehensive legislative reforms \nremoving discrimination of same-sex couples. The Property (Relationships) Legislation Amendment Act 1999 \n(NSW) amended around 20 pieces of legislation on a range of matters including inheritance, accident \ncompensation, legal aid and stamp duty. Where a definition of de facto relationship in existing law failed to \ninclude same-sex couples, these definitions were amended or replaced so that the law would no longer apply \ndifferently to couples of opposite sex and same sex. As a result of these reforms in NSW and similar enactments \nin all other states and territories, same-sex couples achieved equality with heterosexual couples in many areas \nof the law.178  \nIn 2006, the Australian Human Rights Commission (formerly HREOC), released a report that identified 58 federal \nActs that discriminated against same-sex couples.179 The Federal Government, acting on this report, introduced \nthe 2008 reforms comprising: the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Act \n2008 (Cth) which provides for same-sex and heterosexual couples living in a de facto relationship to have their \nproperty and maintenance claims heard under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth)180; The Same-Sex Relationships \n(Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws — General Law Reform) Act 2008 (Cth) which removes discrimination \nagainst same-sex couples from a raft of Commonwealth legislation, including veteran affairs, social security and \nincome tax; and the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Act 2008 \n(Cth) which allows superannuation trustees to make same-sex couples and their children eligible for \nsuperannuation reversionary benefits. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n173.  ‘France’s mayors “cannot block gay marriage”’, Telegraph, 18 October 2013, accessed 28 August 2015.  \n174.

Prior to the coming into operation of this legislation, property and maintenance disputes between unmarried couples were heard in the state \ncourts under state legislation. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 34 \nIn order to benefit from these law reforms, same-sex couples do not have to formalise their relationships. If a \ncouple can satisfy ‘fairly nebulous, but what some might consider intrusive criteria, they will be deemed to be \nliving in a genuine de facto relationship’.181 \nAt federal level the essence of the definition of a de facto relationship is ‘a couple living together on a genuine \ndomestic basis’ who are not legally married or related by family. This definition is substantially the same in state \nlegislation. Both federal and state definitions contain an inclusive list of criteria to be used in determining \nwhether a recognised relationship exists. These factors are: \n• the duration of the relationship  \n• the nature and extent of their common residence  \n• whether a sexual relationship exists  \n• the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, \nbetween them  \n• the ownership, use and acquisition of their property  \n• the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life  \n• the care and support of children  \n• the reputation and public aspects of the relationship.  \nNo particular finding is required in relation to any one of these circumstances in deciding whether the persons \nhave a de facto relationship. The decision-maker therefore has a significant discretion.182  \nAt federal level, a de facto relationship can also exist between two people where one partner is legally married \nto someone else, or is in a registered relationship with someone else or is in another de-facto relationship.183 \nRegistered relationships \nSome Australian states and territories have supplemented their de facto relationship laws with the introduction \nof relationship registers. Registers provide advantages over presumptive relationship recognition in that entering \na ‘registered relationship’ provides conclusive proof of the existence of the relationship, thereby gaining all of \nthe rights afforded to de facto couples under state and federal law without having to prove any further factual \nevidence of the relationship.  \nState relationship registration schemes allowing for same-sex and heterosexual relationship recognition \ncurrently exist in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland. \nThe detail of these schemes varies. For example the Victorian and Tasmanian registration schemes allow both \nfor registration of domestic relationships and for caring relationships to be recognised.184 The ACT, Tasmania and \nNew South Wales schemes each recognise the other’s state registered schemes, however Victoria does not. All \nregisters allow for the recognition of a registered relationship to be revoked. Revocation, while similar to \ndivorce, is arguably easier to obtain.185  \n                                                             \n181.  A Sifris and P Gerber, op. cit., p. 97. \n182.  Note also that some jurisdictions also offer protection to relationships that do not qualify as a de facto or couple relationship (described as \n‘close personal relationship’ in NSW, ‘domestic relationship’ in the ACT, ‘caring relationship’ in Tasmania and Victoria, and ‘close personal \nrelationship’ in SA. However these categories of relationship, with their less stringent criteria, generally receive relatively less recognition and \nrights than those categories of relationship where parties must be a cohabiting couple. For further information see N Witzleb, op. cit., p. 142. \n183.  Family Law Act, paragraphs 4AA(5)(a) and (b). \n184.  Section 5 of the Relationships Act 2008 (Vic) provides that a registrable caring relationship is:  a relationship (other than a registered \nrelationship) between two adult persons who are not a couple or married to each other and who may or may not otherwise be related by \nfamily where one or each of the persons in the relationship provides personal or financial commitment and support of a domestic nature for \nthe material benefit of the other, whether or not they are living under the same roof, but does not include a relationship in which a person \nprovides domestic support and personal care to the other person for fee or reward; or on behalf of another person or an organisation. \n185.  For a fuller explanation of the different legal requirements of relationship registration see: O Rundle, op. cit., p. 126. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 35 \nAt federal level registration of a relationship at state or territory level is also conclusive proof of the existence of \na de facto relationship. \nEntering into a ‘registered relationship’ provides conclusive proof of the existence of the relationship, thereby \ngaining all of the rights afforded to de facto couples under state and federal law without having to prove any \nfurther factual evidence of the relationship.186 \nCivil unions \nFor most, if not all, practical and legal purposes, registration can be equivalent to a civil union, the main \ndifference being that civil unions tend to permit a greater level of formal ceremonial and symbolic \nrecognition.187  \nThe ACT’s history of relationship register and civil union legislation has been more complicated and controversial \nthan that of the states, partly because of constitutional arrangements between the Commonwealth and \nterritories. In its first attempt to introduce legal recognition of same sex relationships, the Civil Unions Act 2006 \n(ACT) allowed two people to enter into a civil partnership by making a declaration to each other in the presence \nof a celebrant and one other witness. That legislation was repealed through disallowance by the then Howard \nGovernment and in response, the ACT Government introduced new legislation, the Civil Partnerships Act 2008 \n(ACT). The 2008 Act removed provisions that allowed people to solemnise by a ceremony, rather than merely \nregister their relationship as a couple. The Civil Partnerships Act 2008 (ACT) was repealed by the Civil Unions Act \n2012 (ACT)188 which essentially re-instated the civil ceremony aspects of the 2006 scheme which had been \npreviously disallowed. The Civil Unions Act 2012 (ACT) is still in force in the Australian Capital Territory. \nThe Queensland Civil Partnerships Act 2011, when first enacted also provided for civil partnership declarations as \nwell as registration. Declarations were required to be performed in front of a civil partnership notary and they \nwere to be available to both same-sex and heterosexual couples. However in 2012 the then recently elected \nCampbell Newman Government made amendments through the Civil Partnerships and Other Legislation \nAmendment Act 2012 (Qld) with the effect that same-sex couples were no longer able to participate in a state \nsanctioned declaration ceremony and the term civil partnership was changed to registered relationship. The Act \nwas renamed the Relationships Act 2011 (Qld).  \nDo these forms of relationship recognition equate to marriage? \nThe literature suggests that Australian law has achieved substantial legal equality between all couples, married \nor unmarried, opposite sex and same-sex.189 Nonetheless there are still some areas in which same-sex couples \nare treated differently. Some of these are described briefly below. \nIn most Australian jurisdictions adoption rights continue to be an area where same-sex couples are treated \ndifferently to opposite-sex couples. Only same-sex couples in New South Wales, the ACT, Tasmania and Western \nAustralia have access to adoption on an equal footing to heterosexual couples.190 \nAt the federal level same-sex and heterosexual couples now come under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) in regard \nto division of property and maintenance. However it is of note that there are additional thresholds for de facto \nrelationships that do not apply to married relationships. Under section 90SB of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) \nthe court can make an order in relation to property adjustment and maintenance only if the unmarried couple \nhave been engaged in the de facto relationship for at least two years, or where there is a child of the \nrelationship, or where the relationship is registered under state or territory law, or where a partner made \nsubstantial contributions and the order is necessary to prevent serious injustice.191 In contrast, there is an \nautomatic capacity on marriage to access the courts to address these matters. \n                                                             \n186.  The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 defines a person as the de facto partner of another person (whether of the same-sex or a different sex) if \nthe person is either in a registered relationship under State or Territory law or if the person is in a de facto relationship with the other person \n(sections 2D, 2E and 2F). \n187.  The term ‘civil union’ seems to have been used first in legislation passed in Vermont in 2000, in response to the Vermont Supreme Court \nruling in Baker v. Vermont, requiring that the State grant same-sex couples the same rights and privileges accorded to married couples under \nthe law, G Griffith, op. cit., p. 4. \n188.  Subsection 33(1).   \n189.  N Witzleb, op. cit., p. 159. \n190.  For details of the legislation relating to adoption in the various jurisdiction, see A Sifris and P Gerber, `Jack & Jill/Jack and Bill: The case for \nsame-sex adoption' AIternate Law Journal  34, 2009, p. 168, accessed 28 August 2015. \n191.  N Witzleb, op. cit., p. 148. \n  \n \nSame-sex marriage: issues for the 44th Parliament 36 \nSuccession and intestacy laws are state and territory matters and have been modified to provide equal rights for \nde facto same-sex and heterosexual couples. However, arguably de facto couples are required to face more \nhurdles than the partners of a marriage. In particular, most states require that couples who are not married \nmust be together in a de facto relationship for at least two years before they will be recognised as the deceased \nintestate’s partner. Note however that the requirements that the relationship be of a certain minimum duration, \ndoes not apply to registered partners.192 \nThere are also small but not insignificant differences in relation to wills and in relation to the division of intestate \nestate between current de facto partners and a previous husband or wife.193 For example in all states, a will is \nrevoked upon marriage, unless the will was made in contemplation of the marriage. Only Tasmania and the ACT \nhave equivalent provisions for those who enter into a significant relationship or civil partnership.194 \nAnother difference between marriage and partnership registration relates to portability with a major drawback \nof the state and territory relationship registries being the lack of portability of the relationship status of \nregistration. The ACT, Tasmania and New South Wales registers have some portability in that they each \nrecognise other state registered schemes, however Victoria does not. In contrast, marriage is recognised \nanywhere in Australia.195  \nArguably one of the more significant remaining differences in the treatment of same-sex couples and married \ncouples relates less to legal rights and responsibilities and more to the social and symbolic status that attaches \nto marriage. Supporters of same-sex marriage argue that relationship registration offers no equivalent to \nmarriage because it lacks the special cultural significance, the ceremonial aspects, and the social status of \nmarriage.196 They say that the prohibition of same-sex marriage denies lesbians and gay men access to this \nparticularly solemn and ceremonial act of expressing commitment to their life partners.197  \nAs one submission to the Senate Committee inquiry into the Marriage Equality Bill 2009 argued: \nA marriage ceremony puts the same-sex relationship into a context everyone is familiar with and has the potential \nto transform what the couple means to each other in the eyes of the family, friends and society in general.198 \n  \n                                                             \n192.

    "abstract": "Australia has achieved a high degree of equality between the treatment of same-sex and heterosexual relationships with marriage remaining the one significant area of difference.\n\nExecutive summary\n\nSame-sex marriage has been on the political agenda in Australia for several years, as part of the broader debate about the legal recognition of same-sex relationships. While there has been a shift in community and political opinion, the issue of same-sex marriage remains complex and controversial. It has raised human rights and constitutional law issues, as well as a raft of social, religious, moral and political questions.\n\nThe purpose of this Research Paper is to update a 2012 Parliamentary Library Background Note and to draw more widely on the extensive resources available on this subject. The paper covers a range of topics including:\n\n\n\tthe views of the political parties\n\tconstitutional issues and the 2013 High Court Same-sex marriage case. In that case the Court found the ACT same-sex marriage law was in conflict with the Commonwealth Marriage Act 1961 and therefore inoperative and ‘of no effect’. Equally significantly, the Court resolved any doubts as to the scope of the ‘marriage power’ finding that the federal Parliament has the power to legislate about same-sex marriage\n\ta comparative analysis of the four private member Bills before the Parliament, introduced by Senator Hanson Young, Senator Leyonhjelm, Mr Shorten MP and a cross party Bill sponsored by Mr Entsch MP. All Bills are similar in that they insert a new identical definition of marriage into the Marriage Act encompassing unions of any two people regardless of sex, and repeal the existing ban on the recognition of same-sex marriages solemnised overseas. The Bills differ in style and substance in relation to the provisions dealing with exemptions for marriage celebrants who may have religious or conscience objections to solemnising gay marriages\n\ta short section comparing the differences between a plebiscite and a referendum, included in response to the recent announcement&nbsp; by the Prime Minister that a popular vote will be held\n\tcomparative material on international developments in other common law countries that have legalised same-sex marriage including the United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand, the United States and Canada\n\ta discussion of the arguments about the possible conflict between marriage equality and religious freedom&nbsp; including the Australian Human Rights Commissioner’s proposed compromise of providing a ‘two tier’ approach that would structurally separate the religious and civil definitions of marriage in the Marriage Act (Cth) but treat them equally in law.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nIn addition, the paper replicates parts of the 2012 Background Note, including a history and outline of the Marriage Act and an appendix dealing with other forms of relationship recognition.\n\nAs the paper concludes, Australia has achieved a high degree of equality between the treatment of same-sex and heterosexual relationships with marriage remaining the one significant area of difference. For some, it is important to take time to ponder and consider the full implications of changing the meaning of this ancient institution.&nbsp; For others, including those who live with the memories and scars of the criminalisation and prejudice endured by homosexuals in the past, it is important to move swiftly to remove this last remaining area of difference. Overseas experience would suggest that a long and protracted discussion about the meaning of marriage, leading up to a popular vote some 18 months away, is likely to promote a passionate, robust and even strident or divisive debate within the Australian community",
