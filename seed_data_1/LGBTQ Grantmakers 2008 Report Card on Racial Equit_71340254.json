As with effective philanthropy, a thoughtful answerkeeps giving – it begs more questions, it illuminateslong after it was offered. For philanthropy’s leader-ship, cultivating healthy institutions that model fairness and opportunity has been as much aboutquestions as answers. Have we, as grantmakers, adequately supported organizations to create a cultureof equity and collective prosperity? Have we improvedour society – if so, for whom? Or have our foundationsbecomes afflicted with obscure, structural factors thatprivilege funding for certain types of organizationswhile unintentionally inhibiting resources fromreaching populations who've long experienced institutional exclusion? This report card representsthe beginning of a dialogue – a Q&A – with our country’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queergrantmakers, asking them to describe how they integrate racial equity into their grantmaking andtheir operations. We asked foundations to look inward:Does your foundation – in grantmaking, governingdocuments, policies, practices, demographics, leadership and strategic communications – promotewidespread equity? Tell us how to strengthen ourmovements and enhance the well-being of all of ourcommunities – Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issuesasked – and we’ll share those lessons. These are the answers from our sector.4MISSION Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues seeks equality and rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) individuals and communities by mobilizing philanthropic resources that advance racial, economic and gender justice.

Specifically, an LGBTQ racial equity lens seeks toidentify how funders can best support LGBTQ communities of color andhelp create a society where “the distribution of resources, opportunities,and burdens was not determined or predictable by race.” In regards to grantmaking, “racial equity” is used broadly to capturegrants to organizations and projects that, as reported by foundations,explicitly reach LGBTQ communities of color. Here, some foundationshave noted that they award grants to organizations that do not specifyaddressing racial inequities and/or reaching communities of color yetmight still benefit these populations, given the organization’s settingand diverse clientele. Others counter that these types of grants shouldnot be conflated with racial equity, since “seemingly race neutralpractices will simply keep in place historical advantages anddisadvantages.” In response we ask: How should we distinguish the widerange of grantmaking paradigms? What are the drawbacks and benefitsto each approach?Finally, at times this report card reviews racial equity in relation toeconomic and gender equity. FLGI acknowledges that racial equity isshaped by multiple issues; the intent of this first-time report card was tohighlight racial equity as a starting point for addressing widespreadequity. As an evolving research model, future reports will revisit wherethe intersection of identities and issues fits into an assessment of LGBTQgrantmakers.The purpose of this report card is to begin disentangling these nuancesby forging a dialogue among grantmakers about the best ways toimplement racial equity into the full breadth of their work. By asking theright questions, together we can pinpoint the answers.1 The references in this section are taken from Grant Making with a Racial Equity Lens. See © GrantCraft, Grant Making with a Racial Equity Lens(New York: GrantCraft and Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity, 2007).6A Research Review of Foundation Performance and Racial EquityThrough their sheer presence, grantmaking and programmatic endeavors, U.S. foundations supportingLGBTQ issues have helped shape how organizations address the social, economic and political landscape oflesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) rights in our country. From 2002 to 2006, the annualgiving of LGBTQ grantmakers has more than doubled from $29.7 million to $65.6 million. In that time frame,LGBTQ grants have increased twofold from 1,570 to 3,042.2The symbiosis that occurs among foundation giving, organizational development and a politicalmovement’s shape has yielded critical analysis and lingering questions. To what extent does foundationfunding for LGBTQ issues reflect our movement's organizational infrastructure, and how much of it is thebyproduct of foundation agendas (and other institutional supports)? Further, if foundations influence thecharacter of LGBTQ organizations—as well as the priorities of a dynamic “movement” nationwide—what istheir responsibility for ensuring that theyhelp remove racial, economic and genderinequities within their foundations, amongtheir grantees and throughout society?   Racial equity as a question for foundationgiving. A growing body of research revealsdisparities in foundation giving tocommunities of color. A 2004 study by theApplied Research Center found thatbetween 1994 and 2001, foundation givingto communities of color grew at a smallerpace than overall giving, and as a proportion of total giving, dropped from 10 to 7 percent between 1998 and2001.3 LGBTQ grantmaking mirrors this trend: In 2006, 9 percent of foundation giving to LGBTQorganizations and projects explicitly reached LGBTQ communities of color.4 Organizations confirm thesefindings: a 2008 study on autonomous LGBTQ people of color organizations in the U.S. found that amajority—57 percent—received no foundation support for their current annual incomes, instead relying onindividuals and events for financial sustenance.5Racial equity as a question for formal analysis. In the context of these disparities, along with the potentialfor reducing racial, economic and gender inequities within our communities,6 Funders for Lesbian and GayIssues undertook a study to distill how LGBTQ grantmakers integrate racial equity into their internal andexternal affairs. Guided by the expertise of evaluators and practitioners who have argued successfully that aholistic assessment of “foundation performance” must encompass more than a review of grantmaking, thisreport card assesses LGBTQ foundations on five overarching areas: grantmaking, governing documents,policies and practices, demographics and leadership, and strategic communications.7“Racial disparities exist in virtually every keyindicator of child, family and communitywell-being. Today many racially inequitableimpacts are produced inadvertently, throughprocesses and choices that may not evenexplicitly address race, may appear race neutral, or may even be offered to address racial disparities.” — The Annie E. Casey Foundation, Race Matters, 2006 A Research Review of Foundation Performance and Racial Equity7Grantmaking: Investing in the Promise of Our MovementsRacial equity as a question for the dollars that foundations provide. Grantmaking serves as a logicalbeginning for an assessment of LGBTQ grantmakers. Since 2002—the year Funders for Lesbian and GayIssues (FLGI) first began collecting data on foundation giving—the 19 foundations assessed in this reportcard have awarded approximately $82 million and more than 5,000 grants to LGBTQ organizations andprojects around the country. Further, their collective giving has more than doubled in that time frame.Through giving alone, the contributions of these foundations have profound effects and implications.In comparison, their collective contribution to LGBTQ people of color organization and projects is a merefraction of their overall LGBTQ support. In 2006, 11 percent of the LGBTQ dollars awarded by these 19foundations reached efforts that explicitly addressed LGBTQ people of color. Further, many of thesefoundations offer little to no discernible dollars to LGBTQ people of color organizations and projects,indicating that the responsibility for LGBTQ racial equity is not shared evenly among the sector. While someblaze trails for widespread equity, others reaffirm the racialized status quo of narrowly defined LGBTQ giving.Governing Documents: Institutionalizing a Commitment to EquityRacial equity as a question for a foundation’s direction. For foundations, governing documents serve ascompasses that direct their daily operations and long-term goals. Missions, visions, strategic plans, fundingpriorities and guidelines, by-laws, value statements, and goals, to name a few, form the basis of afoundation’s grantmaking, programs and operations. For some LGBTQ grantmakers, these documents havealigned their visions for social change with their institutional efforts.Yet, as with the other areas assessed in this report card, the usage and character of governing documentsdiffers among LGBTQ grantmakers. Among foundations that function with marginal staffing, the applicationof governing documents is sparse. And among the other foundations, grantmaking documents vary in bothwording and their interpretation of racial, economic and gender equity as defining elements. For example,some foundations cite race, gender and gender identity explicitly in their documents, positioning theseissues as unassailable factors for LGBTQ rights. Others use broad phrasing that might infer, yet does notassume, a commitment to equity. Pervasive among LGBTQ funders is the dialectic tension found in civilsociety: the discord between a “neutral/colorblind” approach and approaches that are conscious of racial,economic and gender systemic injustice. A Research Review of Foundation Performance and Racial Equity8Policies and Practices: Connecting FoundationPerformance to OpportunityRacial equity as a question for workplace culture. If governing documents are the compass, then policies andpractices serve as maps. Workplace equity measures—diversity audits, recruitment and retention measures,and many others—provide an empirical reality for foundations to devise policies and engage in practicesthat create healthy, inclusive work environments. The public and private sectors have long used a multitude of policies and practices to construct fairworkplaces and diversify their programming; these include diversity audits, recruitment and retention plans,training and technical assistance, and various tools that sharpen how they account for institutional barriers.For example, in “Grantmaking with a Racial Equity Lens,” GrantCraft and the Philanthropic Initiative forRacial Equity synthesize a range of resources, tools and questions that foundations can apply to implement aracial equity lens. Along with many others who have affirmed the social value of these types of policies, theyargue that when foundations implement policies across their institutions, they set in motion a deliberateprocess for minimizing the many inequitiesembedded in all of our organizations.Yet policies and practices are significantlydifferent among the LGBTQ foundationsstudied in this report card. Few of thesefoundations formalize policies and practicesthat explicitly support the full range ofequity concerns; these funders often citeminimal staffing as rationale, contendingthat fewer numbers exempt them fromformal measures or routine scrutiny. Amongtheir foundation counterparts with largerstaff sizes, a racial equity lens is usedsporadically. In many instances, LGBTQfunders report that they prefer a “neutral”approach to human resources.  Demographics and Leadership: Promoting Fairness in the WorkplaceRacial equity as a question for deciding who has a voice in our movement. In any sector, diversifying thedemographics of an organization provides multiple benefits. When foundations diversify their staffing at alllevels—including trustees, executive directors and managers—they enhance their decision making withdiverse viewpoints while incurring numerous legal, public policy, human resource management and otherorganizational benefits. Because the intersecting dimensions of race,ethnicity, gender, class, and culture go so deep,it becomes all the more important forfoundations to embed gendered culturalcompetence throughout formal institutionalprocesses and structures as well as throughoutinformal organizational interactions…And it isimportant to embed both formal and informalstrategies at the board level, in staff leadershipand management levels, and in program andsupport staff as well as in program initiativesthemselves. —Mary Ellen S. Capek and Molly Mead, Effective Philanthropy: Organizational Success through Deep Diversity and Gender Equality, 2006A Research Review of Foundation Performance and Racial Equity9In “Realizing the Promise of Diversity,” author Sonia Ospina, co-director of the Research Center for Leadershipin Action at New York University, outlines the various benefits that workforce diversity creates for bothinstitutions and underrepresented people. Based in a voluminous review of theoretical and empiricalresearch, Ospina proffers an evidence-based inventory of ethical, legal, public policy, human resourcemanagement and organizational benefits that come about as a result of a multicultural workforce. Amongits many benefits, work force diversity: “promotes fairness and justice in the workplace; creates economicopportunity and reduces social inequality;ensures compliance with personnel-relatedlegal requirements; increasescompetitiveness in HR acquisition: enhancesan organization’s reputation and ability toattract and keep the best employees; reduceslabor costs; reduces absenteeism, turnover,and employee dissatisfaction; reduces ‘groupthink’; increases ‘marketing’ advantages andresponsiveness, as work force mirrors clientpopulation; decreases discriminationlitigation; and increases organizationallegitimacy due to enhanced reputation andhigher effectiveness.”8 Without question,workforce diversity yields superlativeadvantages for organizations whilepromoting equity for underrepresentedpopulations.However, philanthropic institutions lag in diversifying their demographics, especially in positions of decisionmaking and authority. A 2002 study of more than 600 grantmakers nationwide found that gays andlesbians, people with disabilities and women of color earned less, and were less likely to advance to seniorlevel positions, than their white male counterparts. Led by researchers from Rutgers University, theUniversity of Minnesota and the National Network of Grantmakers, the study also found that one-fifth offoundation professional staff members were people of color and that boards of directors have remainedlargely white and male for decades. Further, while women are now more represented in philanthropy thanmen, they earned less and gave less in grants than men.  Such research confirms that institutional inequitieshave multiple layers.9Among LGBTQ foundations, a similar homogeny exists. Despite the manifold benefits of workplacediversity, the staffs and boards of LGBTQ grantmakers tend to be predominantly white. Eighty percent ofboard chairs are white men and only a handful of transgender people are engaged in any of thesefoundations. Further, most of the people of color at these foundations are concentrated innon-management staff positions; trustees, executive directors and managers are almost exclusively white.Again, a few foundations deviate from this trend, involving people of color, women and transgender peopleas critical actors in their decision making.In the midst of an active dialogue within the field on accountability and responsiveness tocommunities, a prominent fact remains: the staff and boards of philanthropic institutionshave not kept pace with the general population in terms of diversity. If responsiveness anddiversity are linked, then foundations mustattend to their internal diversity if they wish tooffer a more credible outreach to diversecommunities. However, diversity means morethan numbers; institutional culture andpractices must shift as well. —Joint Affinity Groups, The Meaning and Impact of Board and Staff Diversity in the Philanthropic Field:Findings from a National Study, 2002A Research Review of Foundation Performance and Racial Equity10Strategic Communications: Showcasing the Many Faces of Our CommunitiesRacial equity as a question for the messages we propagate about ourselves. As with other public sectororganizations, strategic communications helps foundations attain a variety of goals. Foundations can drawupon strategic communications to interact with potential and current grantees; promote the success of theirgrantees as well as their own achievements; influence colleagues, policy actors and the general public toshare their visions for change; and abide by democratic tenets of public accountability and transparency. As a tool for redressing systemic inequities, strategic communications can challenge the biased frames,messages and images that predominate in our culture. At their worst, these messages provoke hostilitytowards people of color, women, LGBTQ people, immigrants, and many others. Moreover, they overlook ourcollective diversity and obscure LGBTQ people of color, reifying the myths of LGBTQ people as exclusivelywhite and people of color as exclusively heterosexual.10 The general dearth of positive mediaportrayals—across populations and sub-groups, as well as issues and experiences—has been tracked andwell documented by researchers, media experts, and media watchdog groups such as the Gay and LesbianAlliance Against Defamation, FAIR and Media Matters for America, among others.11To create thoughtful and inclusiverepresentations would mean concerted,strategic efforts on behalf of organizationspositioned to take on this task. Unfortunately,despite the value of smart messages thatidentify structural challenges and solutions forLGBTQ people of color, strategiccommunications as a formal practice variesamong LGBTQ grantmakers. Few of thefoundations assessed in this report cardallocate sufficient resources to implement thewide range of practices such ascommunications audits, branding initiatives,strategic framing and messaging,spokesperson training, media relations and online marketing. Instead, communications tasks are frequently relegated to lead staff members or trustees, many of whomare stretched for time and report lacking the extensive know-how of strategic communications. AcrossLGBTQ grantmakers, communications directors are uncommon and communications plans are virtuallyabsent. And across materials (with some exceptions) people of color are largely absent in imagery.Overall, the quality of communications products varies—and the potential to challenge the problematic,one-dimensional cultural representation of our communities is squandered. “We must expand the public’s ability to recognizeand acknowledge the nuanced ways in whichstructural barriers continue to hobble women andall people of color. Also, we have to stress themessage that our society as a whole benefits whenwe expand opportunities to those who have beendenied throughout history...If the conversationremains unchanged, we will lose.”                –The Center for Social Inclusion, Thinking Change: Race, Framing and the Public Conversation on Diversity.

This review also affirmed that a review of foundations should consider the relationship between theirinternal operations and their external endeavors. For example, the Center for Effective Philanthropy has devised a framework forassessing overall foundation performance that includes a variety of measures grouped within the categories of impact, strategy andagenda, operations and governance. See The Center for Effective Philanthropy, Indicators of Effectiveness: Understanding and ImprovingFoundation Performance (Boston: CEP, 2002).8 Sonia Ospina, “Realizing the Promise of Diversity,” in Handbook of Public Administration: 2nd Edition, edited by J. Perry (SanFrancisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1996).9 Lynn C. Burbridge et al, The Meaning and Impact of Board and Staff Diversity in the Philanthropic Field: Findings from a National Study (San Francisco:Joint Affinity Groups, 2002).10 Media analysts have theorized and documented how media professionals and strategic communicators insist on using “sympatheticcharacters” to tell their stories, often at the expense of describing institutional practices that would identify systemic solutions. For acomprehensive analysis of racial justice communications, see Hunter Cutting, ed. and Makani Themba-Nixon, ed., Talking the Walk: ACommunications Guide for Racial Justice (Oakland: AK Press, 2006), 5-13.11 In 2007, Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues partnered with Make Waves, a communications firm based in New York City, to assesscurrent media coverage on LGBTQ communities of color. The findings from this internal assessment revealed that media coveragewas sparse, rarely strength-based or framed around structural causes or solutions, and tended to focus on a few racial/ethnicpopulations, obscuring the cultural and geographic diversity of U.S. populations.  For additional media criticism and newsmonitoring, visit www.glaad.org, www.fair.org and www.mediamatters.org.As the challenges facing organizations that promote justice andequity for immigrants and established communities of colormount, funding streams for many such organizations have beenreduced to a trickle in recent years. These realities raise several keyquestions: What does the available data on grants to communitiesof color and to justice-based efforts reveal about overall fundingtrends? What factors hinder funding for racial justice within thefoundation community, and which foundation efforts to supportracial justice have been particularly effective?...What can we sayabout the future of racial justice funding overall? —Applied Research Center, Short Changed: Foundation Giving and Communities of Color, 200411A Research Review of Foundation Performance and Racial Equity13LGBTQ Grantmakers 2008 Report CardAdam R.

The interviews included33 questions across five areas:grantmaking, governing documents,policies and practices, demographicsand leadership, and strategiccommunications. Interviewquestions were informed by acomprehensive review of researchand best practices in the foundationsector and the broader publicadministration field. Interviews wereheld between November 2007 andMarch 2008.Purposive sampling of LGBTQfunders. Grants data was collectedthrough self-reporting, a review of990’s, annual reports and onlineresearch. The data was collectedbetween calendar years 2002 and2006.Reviewed formal foundation policies,governing documents andcommunications materials, assessingwhere race, ethnicity, gender andgender identity were considered.Foundations provided detaileddemographic diversity charts of theirstaffing and trustees. The data wascollected between November 2007and March 2008.15 foundations 19 foundations 15 foundations RESEARCH ACTIVITY     Description Total Respondents15Eligibility for Inclusion. The foundations included in this report card meet threecriteria. First, foundations provided 2005 data to FLGI that allowed forconsideration in this report card. Second, foundations provided more than$100,000 in a single year to LGBTQ organizations and projects, based on datafrom 2005. And third, foundations are primarily focused on LGBTQ issues and/orwere founded by an LGBTQ individual.12 Nineteen foundations met thesecriteria. Two foundations declined to participate: the Adam R. Rose Foundationand the Point Foundation. Additionally, despite repeated requests for interviews,FLGI staff were unable to reach the Ted Snowdon Foundation and the Terry K.Watanabe Charitable Trust. Thus, with the exception of the grants analysis, thefindings in this report card are drawn from the 15 foundations that agreed toparticipate and were available for interviews.Moreover, this sample of foundations includes community, public and privatefoundations that are diverse across geographic locations, geographic focuses,size and formation. One notable difference among these foundations is thatsome have multiple staff and board members while others are led by one or afew individuals. The contextual difference of these foundations is accounted forin a number of the findings.12 Some of these foundation focus primarily on LGBTQ issues while others include LGBTQ grantmaking as part of a broader focus. For example, a few grantmakers subsume LGBTQ program areas within focuses such as education, economic uplift or family empowerment.16Report Card Indicators.13 The report card examines how grantmakers address racial equity across five,overarching areas:Grantmaking examines how foundations have supported issues of racial equitywithin their LGBTQ grantmaking and, if applicable, related program areas. Inaddition to the grants analysis, foundations were asked to describe their visions,their funding practices and how they incorporate various equity concerns into theiroverall giving. Foundations were also asked to submit documents that describedtheir funding priorities, such as funding guidelines, criteria for evaluating proposalsand evaluation results that have measured the impact and effectiveness of theirgrantmaking.14Governing Documents examines the extent to which the documents thatgovern a foundation's internal and external affairs consider various forms ofequity. Where applicable, foundations were asked to submit documents such asmissions, strategic plans, vision statements, organizational values, bylaws andother related documents.Policies and Practices examines how foundations consider equity among a rangeof policies and practices. Foundations were asked to describe their hiring practices,board recruitment strategies, diversity training experiences, etc. Foundations werealso asked to submit, if applicable, their diversity/affirmative action plans;employee benefits plans; findings from any type of diversity audit; a sample jobposting; materials from previous diversity trainings; and any formal policies orplans that guide their foundations in promoting job openings, conducting jobinterviews and exit interviews and retaining people of color, women andtransgender people.Demographics and Leadership examines how foundations have diversified theirboards of directors and staffing, across all levels. Foundations were asked to reportthe number of people of color, women and transgender people within theirorganizations, at various levels of leadership, including boards, managementstaffing and non-management staffing.15Strategic Communications examines how foundations communicate their visionsfor LGBTQ rights and where racial equity fits within those portrayals. Foundationswere asked to describe their communications strategies. Generally, foundationswere asked to submit, if applicable, copies of their main publications (generalidentity brochure, annual report, etc.), communications plans, documents thatdescribe key frames and messages, talking points, and findings from any type ofcommunications audit that they had undergone.1234513 In addition to grantmaking, some of these foundations take on other responsibilities and programs such as convening, capacity building, leadershipdevelopment, etc. For this version of the report card, FLGI focused on the aforementioned five areas.14 Prior to each interview, each foundation received a statistical synopsis of its grantmaking from 2002 to 2005. Using data gleaned from FLGI’s annualresearch on LGBTQ grantmaking by U.S. foundations, the synopsis measured each foundation’s total giving and grants to LGBTQ communities and toLGBTQ communities of color. During the interviews, each foundation was asked to react to these findings.15 Given their overt LGBTQ positioning, foundations were not asked to report data on lesbian, gay and bisexual staffing and trustees. FLGI staff will revisit thisdecision in future iterations of this report card.Grantmaking Findings: Investing in the Promise of Our Movements18Grantmaking to LGBTQ Organizations and ProjectsOver the last five years, the 19 foundations reviewed in this report card have provided millions of dollars andthousands of grants to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) issues across the country. Theirrole in shaping the social, economic and political realities of LGBTQ people is unequivocal. From 2002 to2006, these 19 LGBTQ foundations awarded approximately $82 million and 5,163 grants to LGBTQorganizations and projects in the U.S. In 2006 alone, the 19 foundations reviewed in this report card providednearly $27 million and 1,425 grants to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) organizationsand projects throughout the U.S. Similar to the broader LGBTQ grantmaking sector, these 19 foundations have significantly increased theirgiving since 2002. The increase in resources for LGBTQ communities reinforces the importance of strategicand inclusive grantmaking. Total LGBTQ giving by these 19 foundations grew from $10.6 million in 2002 to$26.9 million in 2006, while total grants awarded by these 19 foundations nearly doubled from 746 in 2002to 1,425 in 2006. These 19 foundations are responsible for a significant share of the annual giving awarded by all U.S.foundations to LGBTQ issues. In 2006, the 19 foundations assessed in this report card were responsible for 41 percent of all foundation giving to LGBTQ issues as well as 47 percent of all grants awarded to LGBTQorganizations and projects around the country.

Further, the assetsof U.S. foundations total more than $550 billion. See The Foundation Center, Foundation Yearbook, 2007.Source: Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations: Calendar Years 2002-2006 (New York: FLGI, 2005-2008).19Grantmaking to LGBTQ People of Color Organizations and Projects Among these 19 foundations, as well as the broader foundation sector, grantmaking to LGBTQ people ofcolor organizations and projects increased significantly in the last five years. Among these 19 foundations,total giving increased from $173,000 in 2002 to $2.9 million in 2006. Among the broader sector, total givingto these populations doubled from $1.2 million in 2002 to $5.8 million in 2006.The responsibility for funding LGBTQ people of color efforts is not shared evenly among LGBTQ grantmakers.Only nine of these 19 foundations awarded grants to LGBTQ people of color organizations and projects in2006. Of the remaining 10 grantmakers that did not award any grants to LGBTQ people of color efforts in2006, four have not provided a single grant to address LGBTQ communities of color in the last five years.Among the broader LGBTQ grantmaking sector, only one in four foundations supported LGBTQ communitiesof color in 2006. A mere fraction of the LGBTQ dollars and grants awarded by these nine foundations explicitly reach LGBTQcommunities of color—a reality evident over time. Of the nearly $27 million awarded to LGBTQ issues in2006 by these nine foundations, 10.6 percent ($2.9 million) went to organizations and projects explicitlyworking within LGBTQ communities of color. Among all 266 LGBTQ grantmakers, 8.8 percent was awarded to LGBTQ people of color efforts—the highest percentage for LGBTQ communities of color since FLGI begancollecting data in calendar year 2002.Grantmaking Findings: Investing in the Promise of Our MovementsSummary Statistics for 19 Report Card Foundations and U.S. FoundationsSupporting LGBTQ People of Color Organizations and Projects1717In the absence of detailed grant descriptions, FLGI staff members were not able to fully capture the intended beneficiaries of the grant in the aggregatestatistics.

Foundations cite various reasons for supporting LGBTQ people of color organizationsand projects, including: it’s the “right thing to do”; institutional discrimination plays out differently amongpopulation groups and this requires culturally specific approaches; aligning LGBTQ political struggles withbroader civil and human rights struggles adds numbers and strengthens our movements; and a culturallydiverse leadership augments our analysis and promotes equity within the work place. Foundations acknowledge that a disparity exists between foundation giving to broadly defined LGBTQissues and LGBTQ efforts rooted in a racial equity approach. Many foundations agree that funding forgeneral LGBTQ issues far exceeds funding for LGBTQ people of color organizations and projects. Foundations have varying explanations for why this disparity exists. Some funders define LGBTQ rightsnarrowly—typically by policies such as civil marriage and nondiscrimination measures, or by a generalizedportrayal of LGBTQ people as static and uniform—which might exclude LGBTQ people of color efforts thataddress a wide range of other policy and cultural issues. For others, LGBTQ people of color organizations andprojects are obscure, rare and, from their viewpoints, structurally fragile and unequipped to handle financialsupport or a sophisticated political agenda. Others argue that funders have a preference for prominent,resource-rich organizations, which could leave out smaller, less visible local groups. Finally, others believethey have to make difficult decisions of where to allocate funding and this means choosing their preferencesand excluding funding from LGBTQ people of color organizations and projects.Foundations believe that the philanthropic sector should devote resources to repair racial inequities amongour communities. However, foundations disagree on what constitutes the best approach for achieving racialequity. Some argue for the role of autonomous LGBTQ people of color organizations; others believe thatprojects housed within mainline LGBTQ or people of color organizations are better equipped to achievemajor change; and others advocate for “out-of-box” efforts that work within a host of sectors.Many of these foundations report providing grants to groups working with underserved populations thatcould include people of color (e.g. poor and low-income people, people with HIV/AIDS) and/or groups basedin geographic areas where the organization's clientele includes LGBTQ people of color. Here, some fundersdistinguish between an organization that happens to reach LGBTQ people of color from one that hasdeveloped culturally competent programming that explicitly deals with systemic racial inequities. In regards to funding guidelines, some of these foundations require that grantee applicants reportdemographic data on the diversity of their staffs, boards, volunteers and clientele. Many of thesefoundations do not ask for demographic data, arguing that it’s irrelevant to their funding strategies or thatthe need for probing the diversity of groups differs by project. One foundation observed that groups arebecoming more adept at responding to foundation inquiries about addressing people of color, which makesit difficult to ascertain whether their verbal responses match the authentic nature of their programs. Some foundations have funding guidelines that limit the amount of dollars that they can provide to localgroups around the country, including many LGBTQ people of color efforts. Several foundations noted that anational focus, or a focus on the city and state in which they reside, prevents them from supporting localizedefforts, including the range of groups working within LGBTQ communities of color.21Grantmaking Findings: Investing in the Promise of Our MovementsMany foundations express concerns about supporting an organization without a 501(c)(3), including thosewith fiscal sponsors. Some funders note the technical difficulties in allocating funding to groups that lackboth a 501(c)(3) and a fiscal sponsor. For others, the concern is rooted in a perception that groups withouttheir own 501(c)(3)s (regardless of fiscal sponsors) may be structurally unstable, regardless of the age of theorganization. 19Overall, foundations crave tools to help them improve how their institutions promote racial equity, alongwith other equity concerns. Specifically, funders are interested in tools that relate to grantmaking andnonprofit management; deal with the intersection of sexuality, gender identity, race, ethnicity, gender andclass; and are applicable to their unique context.  Grantmaking Highlights By total giving, the top three foundations supporting LGBTQ people of color organizations and projects in2006 were(1) the Arcus Foundation (2) the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice and (3) the H. van Ameringen Foundation. By total grants, the top three foundations supporting LGBTQ people of color organizations and projects in2006 were (1) the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice (2) the Arcus Foundation and (3) the Horizons Foundation.In their funding priorities and guidelines, the Arcus Foundation and Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justicego further than asking organizations to reflect the diverse composition of LGBTQ communities—they fundefforts that address the interrelated racial, economic and gender injustices affecting our diversecommunities. For example, Astraea's grantmaking philosophy, included in its guidelines, favors organizationsthat are “committed to addressing the intersections of various oppressions, and demonstrate commitmentto social, racial, economic and gender justice.” The Arcus Gay & Lesbian Fund includes an explicit racialjustice, sexual orientation, and gender identity area that supports efforts “at the intersection of racial justice,sexual orientation and gender identity.” The Gay & Lesbian Fund for Colorado—established in 1996 as a project of the Gill Foundation—providesgrants to groups working without an explicit LGBTQ programmatic focus. In its lifetime, the Fund hasawarded thousands of grants and a variety of awards and other resources to people of color organizations,projects and individuals throughout the state. The Fund’s grantmaking aims to shift the culture of theseorganizations while promoting LGBTQ visibility; in order to receive funding, grantees must havenondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation and gender expression.   Recognizing the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on people of color, including men who have sex withmen, the Horizons Foundation encourages HIV/AIDS Community Grants applications from programsfocused on African American and Latino MSMs. In addition, in 2006 the Horizons Foundation launched itsLeader Fellowships program to support the leadership and organizational development of LGBTcommunities of color. 18 These findings are drawn from the 15 foundations that were interviewed. See “Methodology.”19 For autonomous people of color organizations, many of which report having fiscal sponsors but not their own 501(c)(3) status, these attitudes could affecttheir level of support from these foundations. See Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, Building Communities: Autonomous Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and QueerOrganizations in the U.S. (New York: FLGI, 2008).Governing Documents Findings: Institutionalizing a Commitment to Equity22Governing Documents Findings: Institutionalizing a Commitment to EquityWhile a few foundations have specified “racial justice” in their missions and visions, most operate under“all-inclusive” statements that could include LGBTQ communities of color yet do not presume racial equityas a core goal. Many foundations augment their descriptions of LGBTQ communities and rights with termssuch as \"all-inclusive\" and \"full diversity,\" without specifying the populations that comprise this spectrum.Several of these foundations report basing their governing documents on the personal interests—orwills—of their founders. Eight of these foundations were founded by white, gay men, a few of whom havepassed away and whose legacies remain in their foundations’ grantmaking. Staff members at thesefoundations contend that their governing documents are expressions of their founders’ personal interestsand values; thus, their role as staff members is to effectively translate their founders’ visions.While a few foundations have clauses in their bylaws that encourage—in one case, requires—racial andgender diversity across their staffs and boards, most bylaws are absent of these distinctions. Manyfoundations express concerns about the consequences or the usefulness of institutionalizing diversityrequirements into their bylaws; others feel that without embedding a commitment into formal documents,support for diversity could fluctuate based on the leadership of the foundation.About a third of these foundations lack strategic plans that guide their grantmaking; among those withstrategic plans, few articulate strategies for achieving racial equity among LGBTQ communities. Overall, onlya few foundations have short-term and long-term goals to better support LGBTQ people of color and topromote widespread equity.Foundations disagree about the overall usefulness of codifying a racial equity lens into their governingdocuments. Some foundations argue that if the intent for racial equity already exists among staff and boardmembers, codifying language into governing documents is unnecessarily bureaucratic. A few rebut thatracial equity strategies are secondary, maybe irrelevant, to their primary strategy of “LGBTQ rights.” Andothers contend that the intent of individuals rarely translates into institutional application; thatgrantmaking practice matters more than individual supportiveness; and that an institution that relies onthe whims of its present leaders can shift when those individuals are replaced. 23Governing Documents Findings: Institutionalizing a Commitment to EquityGoverning Documents HighlightsThe Arcus Foundation and Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice have missions explicitly centered on themultiple justice issues facing LGBTQ communities. Astraea's mission reads: “The Astraea Lesbian Foundationfor Justice works for social, racial and economic justice in the U.S. and internationally. Our grantmaking andphilanthropic advocacy programs help lesbians and allied communities challenge oppression and claim theirhuman rights.” The mission of the Arcus Foundation is “to achieve social justice that is inclusive of sexualorientation, gender identity and race, and to ensure conservation and respect of the great apes.” Bothfoundations transfer the spirit of these missions into their various governing documents. In the board composition section of its bylaws, the Horizons Foundation includes a provision to strive “forequitable gender and ethnic representation among board members.” Other foundations require a diverseboard composition: Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice’s bylaws mandate that more than half of itsboard of directors be lesbians and more than half be people of color. Further, Astraea’s bylaws state acommitment to be “trans-inclusive of all gender identities and gender queer-identified people.” “Thinking of racial equity as a social outcomemeasure also highlights the reality that onecannot know whether or not solutions have beenachieved, or are even being approached, withoutan ability to measure racial or ethnic data. Byexamining data and openly asking the rightquestions, some grant makers are putting a racialequity lens into operation in developing strategyand programs, shaping guidelines and criteria,working with grantees, and promoting racialequity within their institutions.” —GrantCraft and Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity,Grantmaking with a Racial Equity Lens, 2007.Policies and Practices Findings: Connecting Foundation Performance to Opportunity24Policies and Practices Findings: ConnectingFoundation Performance to OpportunityAcross the many possible policies and practices that help recruit, hire and retain people of color, women,transgender and gender non-conforming people, and poor and low-income people, most of thesefoundations report having few of them in place. Foundations acknowledge the general absence in theirinstitutions of comprehensive policies and practices that could create multicultural environments and helpdiversify their grantmaking. Some foundations believe that the small staff sizes of their foundations andboards exempts them from such policies. Others feel too busy to devote the necessary time to devise andimplement appropriate practices.None of these foundations report ever having conducted a formal, comprehensive “diversity” audit thatidentifies how inequities transpire across their grantmaking and their internal operations. Without theinformation to assess where unintentional barriers may exist, or disparities may play out, many of thesefoundations are uncertain about the extent to which their workplaces promote opportunity and fairness.None of the foundations have ever formally assessed—using statistical methods and theoreticalanalysis—whether race and gender-based pay inequities exist within their staffs and consultants. Generally,foundations report using less rigorous human resource reviews to examine whether salaries seemappropriate. To determine salary ranges for open positions, foundations report relying on industry-widestaffing surveys weighted by traditional factors such as job description, work experience and cost-of-living.However, none of these foundations have quantifiable evidence that confirms salary equity across race,gender and other characteristics typically related to job discrimination.Many of these staffed foundations have protocols for reporting discrimination and harassment on the job.Among foundations with staffing, most have a protocol for reporting discrimination and harassment on thejob. Foundations typically enact grievance procedures where employees report harassment to supervisors; insituations where the supervisor is the harasser, the employee would approach the executive director, and soon. While all of these protocols are confidential, none are anonymous; as an explanation, one foundationcontends that anonymous reports hinder an institution from taking formal action. In regards to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) standards, foundations report posting EEO signs in theirworkplaces and including relevant EEO language in job postings. Nevertheless, many of these foundationsare unsure if their employees understand what it means to work in an EEO environment.Several foundations engage in practices that build upon the legal framework of Equal EmploymentOpportunity. A few foundations require grantees to have EEO statements and/or nondiscrimination policiesthat include sexual orientation, gender identity/expression and the range of legally protected categories. 25Policies and Practices Findings: Connecting Foundation Performance to OpportunityWhile some foundations report using informal methods, on a per case basis, to recruit a diverse applicantpool for job openings, no foundation reports a formal, standardized recruitment plan for recruiting orretaining people of color, women and transgender people. Many of these foundations rely on EEOstatements instead of “affirmative action” programs. Further, a number of these foundations argue thatformal plans are unnecessary since the current leadership already shares a personal commitment toreaching out to diverse populations.  For the job interview process and for staff orientations, some foundations include questions about anindividual’s comfort with diverse workplaces. However, these types of questions are rarely standardizedamong these foundations. A few foundations with explicit racial, economic and gender justice values alsoask candidates to share a commitment to their institutional frameworks, guiding them through thisdiscussion during job interviews and staff orientations.Some foundations track how long staff and board members remain involved in their institutions, thoughthey rarely track for disparities based on race, class or gender. Moreover, most of these foundations have nostandardized exit interview process that captures and reports data on inequities in the workplace. Manyfoundations acknowledge that lacking consistent measures makes it impossible to effectively ascertainwhether certain populations are more likely to leave.Some foundations have strict investment guidelines that prohibit them from investing in companieswithout non-discrimination policies that include “sexual orientation,” or in companies that do not offerdomestic partnership benefits. None of these foundations report similar investment restrictions based on acompany’s commitment to racial equity or its engagement in practices that create racial, economic andgender injustices.The employee benefit plans offered by these foundations vary in their support for LGBTQ people, people ofcolor, women and other categories where benefits can impact their well-being on the job. Foundationsreport offering a variety of benefits—drastically different by foundation—such as domestic partnershipbenefits, parental leave, education reimbursements, childcare allowances and HIV/AIDS-related benefits,among others. Few foundations report considering how plans could address the needs of transgenderemployees.On occasion, some foundations have hired diversity trainers for their staffs and boards—with hesitation andwith mixed results. Many foundations express skepticism that these trainings yield positive results. Onefoundation encourages staff and board members to identify diversity training topics.Foundations have varying approaches to diversifying their boards of directors, though few have committeesor plans devoted to diversifying their institutional make-ups. Some foundations set explicit, numeric goalsin their bylaws, some use demographic charts to track the make-up of their board across multiplecharacteristics, and others craft board meeting agendas to address gaps in the demographic make-up oftheir boards. Few foundations have formal diversity plans to recruit and retain a diverse board of directors. Policies and Practices Findings: Connecting Foundation Performance to Opportunity26Policies and Practices HighlightsThe Pride Foundation has a range of committees across the Pacific Northwest that review grants and helpmake decisions about scholarships, a number of which were started by LGBTQ people of color. PrideFoundation ensures that LGBT people of color play a critical role in these committees and reports that 40percent of scholarship recipients are people of color. The Kevin J. Mossier Foundation has an investment policy that restricts investments in companies withoutLGBT-friendly nondiscrimination policies in place. The Paul Rapoport Foundation related the following stories: When it hired its first transgender employee in 1998, the foundation revisited a number of its internal policies and published documents to ensure theywere trans-inclusive. In 2004, the foundation enacted a strategic plan that prioritized funding fortransgender people and communities of color. The foundation believes that these two events, together, led to an increase in the number of grants that they currently award to transgender communities andcommunities of color.Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice asks U.S.-based grantees to complete comprehensive diversity chartsacross board members, staff, active volunteers, members and constituents/audiences that measurerace/ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ability and other characteristics such as immigrationand HIV status. To address geographic, economic and technological divides across the Pacific Northwest, the PrideFoundation has occasionally purchased a laptop and helped cover travel expenses for groups based inremote geographic areas that rely on the Internet for communication. 27Demographics and Leadership Findings: Promoting Fairness in the WorkplaceStaff Demographics and Leadership20Together, these foundations employ 109 individuals and vary significantly in staff size.21 Ten of these 19foundations operate with three or fewer staff members, while staffing among five of the remainingfoundations ranges from 10 to 34 staff members. Only five foundations report having any non-managementstaff members.43% (47/109) of these staff members are people of color, 61% are women (66/109) and 4% (4/109) aretransgender people.Six foundations have no people of color staff members, three foundations have no women staff membersand 13 foundations have no transgender staff members.Among these foundations, people of color tend to be concentrated in non-management positions; womenmake up more than half of all management and non-management positions; and transgender people arevirtually absent from the staffing of all of these foundations. Thirty percent (14/47) of managementpositions among LGBTQ foundations are occupied by people of color. In contrast, people of color make up 53 percent (33/62) of non-management positions among these LGBTQ foundations. Women make up 66 percent of management positions and 58 percent of non-management positions. Ten (67 percent) of these 15 foundations have no people of color in management positions. Among theremaining five foundations, the percentage of people of color managers ranges from 20 to 75 percent. Two (13 percent) of these 15 foundations are headed by women of color executive directors while the remaining 13 foundations are led by white people. Overall, eight foundations (53 percent) are headed by white male executive directors/presidents and five foundations (33 percent) are headed by white female executive directors. 20These findings represent a diverse sampling of foundations that includes community, public and private foundations across geographic locations, geographicfocuses, size and formation. One notable difference among these foundations is that some have multiple staff and board members while others are led by oneperson or a few individuals. The contextual difference of these foundations is accounted for in a number of the findings.21The figures included in this section are based on demographic data provided by 15 of the 19 foundations assessed in this report card. Two foundationsdeclined to participate and despite repeated requests for interviews, FLGI staff members were unable to reach two other foundations.Demographics and Leadership Findings: Promoting Fairness in the Workplace28Board Demographics and LeadershipTogether, these foundations engage 122 board members across boards of various sizes. Nine of thesefoundations have board sizes of seven or fewer. Among six of the remaining foundations, board size rangesfrom 11 to 22 members. 30% (22/122) of these board members are people of color, 48% are women (58/122) and 3% (4/122) aretransgender people.Ten of these foundations have two or fewer people of color on their boards, four have two or fewer womenand no foundation has more than two transgender people on its board of directors. Twelve foundationshave no transgender board members.80 percent (12/15) of these foundations have white male board chairs or co-chairs. In, contrast, threefoundations have people of color board chairs or co-chairs, four have white female board chairs or co-chairsand zero have transgender board chairs. Demographics and Leadership HighlightsAmong their LGBTQ grantmaking peers, Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice has the most diverse staffand board. Its executive director, board chair, management team and overall demographics arepredominantly queer women of color, and its overall composition includes, among others, people of variousraces, ethnic backgrounds and nationalities, as well as transgender people.Two foundations—Arcus Foundation and Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice—are headed by lesbians of color. Urvashi Vaid serves as executive director of the Arcus Foundation and Katherine Acey heads AstraeaLesbian Foundation for Justice.29Strategic Communications Findings: Showcasing the Many Faces of our CommunitiesStrategic Communications Findings: Showcasing the Many Faces of our CommunitiesThe communications capacities of these foundations vary considerably; most operate without strategiccommunications plans and without staff primarily focused on communications. A few foundations areworking with consultants and trustees to launch an overhaul of their communications capacities, includinghiring communications staff and undergoing activities such as audits, branding, framing and messaging,and media relations, among other tasks.Few foundations have staff positions explicitly devoted to strategic communications. Communicationsresponsibilities are typically handled by executive directors, management staff and/or board members whoreport being often programmatically overwhelmed. Further, many of these foundations are unsure theyhave the specific expertise to best handle the breadth of communications responsibilities.Many foundations report devoting minimal funding or programmatic attention to strategiccommunications—much less to ensuring that their efforts incorporate racial equity. Without the staffing tohandle communications, these foundations are moderately satisfied with their current efforts and unsure iftheir imagery, language and deliverables take into account racial, economic and gender inequities or thediversity of our communities.Some foundations believe that little, if any, of a foundation’s dollars should be used to support its ownstrategic communications. These foundations argue that allocating money to communications dilutes the overall pool of grantmaking funds in exchange for the “unnecessary” benefit of self-promotion. Manyothers contend that strategic communications helps actualize numerous foundation goals that complementgrantmaking and other programs.For many of these foundations, across printed materials and online marketing vehicles, people of color arerarely visible in photographs. A handful of foundations serve as exceptions, positioning people of colorprominently in annual reports, brochures, newsletters, web sites and on-line marketing.A few foundations communicate the situational and historic context of racial inequities for various LGBTQcommunities of color—across populations, issues and geographic location. In contrast, the remainingfoundations either include photos of people of color in their materials or seemingly ignore the racial/ethnicand gendered dimensions of LGBTQ communities in their visuals.Some foundations rely entirely on web sites or the back-and-forth interaction of the grant application processto communicate with grantees. For a few foundations, web sites are the only places where funding priorities,guidelines and grants are visible to the public. At the other end of the spectrum is a foundation with acommunications department, a comprehensive communications plan, consistent branding and messaging,and a full range of communications methods to maximize visibility and achieve its multiple goals.Some of these foundations rarely make their guidelines and priorities visible to the outside world, includingpotential grantees. While they acknowledge that this could limit the breadth of grant proposals they receive,these foundations generally believe that most of their intended beneficiaries know about them and, thus,are hesitant about making themselves too available for contact. Some foundations prefer to stay beneaththe radar to protect both the private nature of their living founders and their grantmaking decisions. Strategic Communications Findings: Showcasing the Many Faces of our Communities30For community foundations with fundraising components, communications efforts are often tied todevelopment goals. In order to engage the many types of donors and critical actors in their communities,community foundations note the importance of ensuring that their materials portray the full racial/etchnicand gendered diversity of their communities.Generally, foundations agree that strategic communications supports their many goals and would like toimprove their capacities, which includes integrating a racial, economic and gender equity lens. Foundationsnoted a number of areas where they need improvement, including framing, messaging, developing effectivematerials, identifying and training spokespeople, media relations, online marketing, public polling, andmonitoring and evaluation.Strategic Communications HighlightsAcross the printed materials that foundations provided—newsletters, annual reports, brochures andpamphlets—Arcus Foundation, Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Gill Foundation, HorizonsFoundation and Pride Foundation (as notable examples) consistently feature a diverse breadth ofindividuals and families of color, including women, people of various ages, and transgender and gendernon-conforming people. The Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice’s philosophy of racial, economic and gender justice underpins itsstrategic communications. To produce its deliverables, Astraea prioritizes vendors that are lesbian-led, peopleof color-led, unionized and/or environmentally friendly. Astraea also forgoes stock photography, relying onhigh-quality photographs of grantees and donors to showcase their work and to root Astraea’s impact inauthentic people and successes. To ensure safety, Astraea considers where cultural and geographicsensitivities require that special consideration be taken when discussing the work of grantees, in both the U.S.and other areas of the globe. Often, profiles of grantees are authored in a way that situates them in ahistorical context, noting the interrelated systemic challenges afflicting diverse communities worldwide. Thiscontextual narrative, Astraea argues, positions grantees as figures addressing the historic, geopoliticalinjustices designed and carried out by those in power. And to ensure accessibility, Astraea produces resourcesin languages other than English, where applicable, and cautions against the use of culturally-biased language.For example, in its international fund guidelines, Astraea notes, “We recognize the limitations of Westerndefinitions of trans and same-gender-loving people and support indigenous expressions of these identitiessuch as ‘Two Spirit’ (Native American), ‘Shamakhami’ (Bengali), ‘Hijra’ (Hindi), etc.” A first step is for organizations in the field to ensurethat they have their own house in order. It isimportant for organizations to model racial equityinternally if they are to take responsibility forachieving such ends in the wider community.–The Aspen Institute Roundtable on Community Change, Structural Racism and Community Building, 2004.33Key Questions for GrantmakersTotal giving by U.S. foundations to LGBTQ people of color organizations and projects increased from $1.2 million to $5.8 million between 2002 and 2006.22Q: What—or who—accounts for this increase? And who has benefited from this giving?Ten of these 19 foundations did not award any grants to LGBTQ people of color organizations and projects in 2006. Q: What is the role of an LGBTQ grantmaker in explicitly supporting causes that address the structural racial, economic and gender inequities in our communities? Should this responsibility be evenly shared among funders?Foundations disagree about the definitions of “racial equity” in the programs they support. Some contendthat if a project happens to reach people of color because the organization’s clientele is racially andethnically diverse, it should be deemed “racial equity.” Others argue that providing resources to LGBTQcommunities of color (regardless of how the project understands structural inequities) fits a “racial equity”framework. And still others posit that the project must analyze and address the structures of racialinequities in order to qualify as “racial equity” or “racial justice.” Q: What is the nature of this disagreement? Who benefits within each approach?According to 2006 figures, 9% of LGBTQ giving went to projects explicitly addressing communities of color,2% to groups addressing transgender and gender non-conforming people, and 0.4% to efforts addressingpoor and economically disadvantaged people.23Q: What accounts for these small percentages? What happens to the direction of LGBTQ rights in our country?Some foundations report creating funding guidelines that require grantees to adopt nondiscriminationpolicies regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, while others work with grantees to strengthentheir organizational capacities, improve the leadership of individuals and refine their analysis andprogrammatic design. Q: Should foundations similarly encourage an explicit commitment to racial, economic and gender equity in their grantees? What would happen to the direction of LGBTQ rights in our country?Recent research has found that autonomous LGBTQ people of color organizations in the U.S. tend to be local,operate with little or no staffing and exist without a 501(c)(3) (though many have fiscal sponsors). Notably,these groups report rarely receiving much foundation support.24 In turn, a number of these report cardfoundations are reticent about supporting groups without their own 501(c)(3) status (for a variety of reasonsstated earlier), and/or function under funding guidelines that confine their grantmaking to nationalorganizations or groups based in a specific geographic area. Q: What needs to change in order for funding to reach LGBTQ people of color organizations? How much of this change needs to take place within our foundations or within the nature of traditional grantmaking practice?22FLGI, LGBTQ Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations: Calendar Year 2006.23Ibid.24FLGI, Building Communities, 2008.34Some foundation leaders contend that their funding strategies merely represent the interests of their livingor deceased donors, which complicates their personal abilities to shape agendas and address various issuesof equity. Q: How could foundations balance the interests of their donors with those of the public interest? In a society where racial, economic and gender inequities predominate, should all foundations play a role in promoting widespread equity?Q: How can governing documents codify a commitment to racial, economic and gender equitiesin a way that enriches their analysis on sexual orientation and gender identity? Do LGBTQ grantmakers become more effective when they integrate a widespread equity lens into their governance?The demographics of these foundations reveal that the executive directors, board chairs and boards ofdirections are predominantly—in some foundations, exclusively—white. People of color tend to berelegated to non-management positions and transgender people are nearly absent. Q: How did this happen? What are the consequences?A body of empirical and theoretical research has found that an institution’s ability to effectively recruit,retain and promote people of color and other underrepresented populations requires deliberate effortsacross the institution. Yet many of these foundations lack these broad policies. Q: If the supportiveness and the intent exists among the leadership of these foundations to address racial, economic and gender inequities (as they report), yet the grant, staff, board, and leadership demographics reveal enormous disparities, what becomes the avenue for diversifying our foundations? What is understood as the value of these various types of policies and practices? Is equity a theory, a matter of the heart, or a deliberate body of practices and policies that reform entire institutions?As with many nonprofit organizations, these foundations have a limited communications capacity, ofteninformed by small communications budgets, staffing limitations and limited expertise. Yet many of thesefoundations argue that their communications capacities must improve in order to achieve their many goalsand help improve how the public understands the full breadth of our communities. Q: Regardless of its resources, how could a foundation’s strategic communications efforts embody issues of racial, economic and gender equity?   Based on the findings from this report card, Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues will develop an online,interactive toolkit that draws on best practices from these foundations, as well as the broader fields ofphilanthropy, racial equity and nonprofit management. We’ll also partner with leading thinkers andactivists in the field to root our analysis in the wisdom of people on the front lines of racial, economic andgender equity. Q: If we’ve asked the questions, and yielded the first set of answers, what are the choices that our foundations could make to begin integrating equity into their overall work? How could this Q & A—this dialogue—continue? 116 East 16th Street, 7th Floor New York, NY  10003T 212 475 2930 •  F 212 982 3321 •  www.lgbtfunders.org/RacialEquityR A C I A LE  U I T YQFunders forLesbian and GayIssues",
