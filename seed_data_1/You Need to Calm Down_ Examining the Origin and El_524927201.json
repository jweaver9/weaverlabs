I will also limit the focus to the term’suse in law concerning violence motivated by sexualorientation. This choice is made not to diminish thedevastating prevalence of violence against all LGBTQ+people—especially transgender people—but instead to focusthis Comment and avoid over-simplifying queer identities inthe law. The intersectionality of such queer identities andthe impossibility of truly divorcing these identities whenlooking at a history of hate crimes does not go, and shouldnot go, unacknowledged.In this Comment, I will start by examining the history ofthe specific psychological term “gay panic” and itsextrapolation to a legal defense strategy. I will next look atits continued legal application despite changing publicopinion, as well as judicial decisions and legislativeaccomplishments. Finally, I will propose changes to the Federal Rules of Evidence limiting the ability to use theLGBTQ+ panic defense in court as a much-needed anti-homophobic stance from the legal community. While greateracceptance of the LGBTQ+ community is growing, the legal community still has a responsibility to act proactively toensure the safety of the most vulnerable under the law.I.

Origin of the Term Throughout history, sexuality has always existed acrossa biological spectrum. In nature, many animals, includingbeetles, sheep, fruit bats, dolphins, and orangutans, showhomosexual tendencies.10 In human sexuality, gay peoples’ existence and contributions predate the gay rightsmovement by several millennia. References to homosexualitycan be found in ancient traditions across the world, spanningethnicities, religions, and traditions, such as the Torah ofAncient Judaism, the New Testament of Christianity, the writings of Greek philosophers, and the ceremonial roles forLGBTQ+ people in Indigenous American nations.11 If notexclusively homosexual, many famous historical figuresexpressed bisexual desires, such as Socrates, Alexander theGreat, Lord Byron, Edward II, Hadrian, Julius Caesar,Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo da Vinci, Oscar Wilde,Vita Sackville-West, Alfonsina Storni, and ChristopherMarlowe.12 Despite the widespread knowledge of a sexualityspectrum, the United States has historically restricted gayrights.

With more visibility came more attempts to studyand analyze homosexuality, particularly in the rapidlyexpanding fields of psychology and psychiatry.To standardize the field of psychiatry, the AmericanPsychiatry Association published the “Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders,” known as theDSM-I, in 1952. This manual listed all recognized mentaldisorders to assist psychiatrists in classifications anddiagnoses.17 One such mental disorder found in the DSM-I was “homosexuality” as a “sociopathic personalitydisturbance.”18 Despite research on homosexuality fromvarious psychologists showing the normality ofhomosexuality, the DSM-I’s classification showed the prevailing attitude of the psychiatric community: it was amental disorder for deviants on the level of pedophilia andsadism.19 Not long after the DSM-I was released, with itsinclusion of the psychological term of “panic, acute homosexual,”20 came the first iteration of “gay panic,” orLGBTQ+ panic, as a legal defense strategy. As a strategy,the term took on a new life, and was manipulated into itsmore widely known definition, meaning the reactionary use of violence, separating and broadening its previouspsychiatric definition.Homosexuality as a mental disorder would remain in theofficial DSM until 1973, even after the DSM was revised intothe DSM-II.21 Throughout the 1960s, gay activists worked inand around the American Psychology Association to 17.

Anonymous (due to the risk of openlyidentifying as gay) to testify on behalf of the declassificationcommittee at a conference in 1972.23 In addition to Dr.Fryer’s appearance on panels, gay activists also disruptedpanels and gave speeches to make a clear statement to thepsychological community: “Stop it, you’re making me sick.”24 Facing pressure from gay rights activists followingsuccessful movements such as the Stonewall Riots, the termwas eventually removed in 1973.25 Despite some initialdissent in the psychology and psychiatry communities, thedecision to remove homosexuality as a mental disorder wassupported by scientific research from psychologists onhuman sexuality.26 The classification of homosexuality as apsychiatric disorder was removed in the sixth reprinting ofthe DSM-II in 1973.27 B. The Early Uses of LGBTQ+ Panic as a Legal Defense The DSM-I’s initial definition of “gay panic” was areactionary use of violence. This definition was utilized soonafter the DSM-I’s publication. One of the earliestdocumented uses of LGBTQ+ panic as a mitigating factor occurred during the trial for the murder of William T.Simpson, in which the defendants claimed Simpson’shomosexuality was a mitigating factor for their crime.28 On 22.

He had tolda co-worker about a scheduled date he had that evening.29 On the way to his date, Simpson stopped at a bar, where hewas propositioned by Charles Lawrence.30 Unbeknownst toSimpson, Lawrence was notorious in Miami for scamminggay men by propositioning and then robbing them.31 Lawrence would lure gay men into a secluded area under abridge with the promise of relations, and then his accomplice,Lewis Killen, would rob the victim.32 While the two wereknown for this modus operandi, called “rolling” gay men,they had previously limited their crimes to theft until August2, when they escalated to lethal violence for unknownreasons.33 Lawrence shot Simpson, and the two left him face-down in gravel, taking off with the twenty-five dollarsSimpson had on him at the time.34 Two Miami residentsfound Simpson’s body, where it had been left in a roadway ina pool of blood.35 The very next day, the Miami Daily News reported themurder, indicating its location as a “Lovers Lane” based onits alleged popularity in the gay community for its seclusion.Even in Miami, known for its popular and vibrantunderground gay club scene, 1950s Florida was not ahospitable place for same-sex relations.36 Miami Daily Newsreferenced Simpson’s suspected sexuality, leading the story29.

I’ve got a teen-age boy”—even though noconclusive evidence was presented at trial that the victimshad solicited sexual relations.72 Evidence was presentedthrough witness testimony that the defendant, with a group of high school friends, had set out to harass gay men and hadentered the victims’ car with the intention of violentlyassaulting them.73 Despite this evidence, Hampton chose todisregard the prosecution’s desired sentence of life imprisonment and chose to sentence the defendant to thirtyyears.74 When asked about his decision, Hampton stated, “Idid what I thought was right.”75 Hampton was censured by ajudicial panel in 1989 for his comments following thissentence.76 In 1993, he also narrowly lost a race for a positionon the Texas Court of Appeals, possibly due to his rationalefor leniency in the sentencing, as Democrats stated thatabout one-fifth of Hampton’s opponent’s fundraising hadcome from gay supporters and LGBTQ+ organizations.77 Although politically defeated, Hampton’s sentimentsand thus lenient sentencing regarding crimes of this naturewere certainly not unique to him. In 1994, Judge DavidYoung of Utah drew similar criticism for reducing thesentence of David Nelson Thacker after his killing of DouglasKoehler, which was motivated by Koehler’s sexual orientation.78 Thacker had met Koehler at a bar, and theywent back together to Thacker’s bedroom, where they used72.

But thereare signs that it is on its way out.II. CURRENT CLIMATE OF LGBTQ+ TOLERANCE AND THE STATUS OF LGBTQ+ PANIC DEFENSE In this Part, I will look at how attitudes over the last halfcentury have evolved towards tolerance.93 I will next look atlandmark Supreme Court cases that have guaranteedcertain civil rights for LGBTQ+ people.

Although I note and celebrate the changing cultural attitudes here, I donot want to give the impression that this is a “mission accomplished” moment. Itshould not go unacknowledged that every millimeter that the needle has movedtoward acceptance was fought (and continues to be fought) for tooth and nail bythe gay rights movement. While not the focus of this Comment, I also do not want to leave unacknowledged the prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and evenviolence that many members of the LGBTQ+ community have faced and continueto face, to say nothing of the willful ignorance the American governmentperpetuated in the face of the literal plague of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980sand 1990s. Although that is not the purpose of this specific argument, my argument would be deficient to the point of ignorance without acknowledging thehistory and reason for such cultural attitude changes.                                                              970 BUFFALO LAW REVIEW [Vol. 70judicial victories. Finally, I will analyze legal scholarshipspecifically on the LGBTQ+ panic defense and potentialrecommendations pertaining to the defense’s future.A. Changes in Cultural Attitudes Show Increased Acceptance of LGBTQ+ People One of the most promising advancements toward the elimination of the LGBTQ+ panic defense is the cultural shiftand growing acceptance of same-sex relationships. The ability of a defendant to use an LGBTQ+ panic defensestrategy relies on a jury believing that panic is a reasonablereaction—or at least not unthinkable reaction—to a same-sex romantic advance. A jury must think that a violentreaction could be a rational one. That is a harder argumentto make when LGBTQ+ people are more visible in today’ssociety than in that of previous generations. It becomes muchharder to argue that LGBTQ+ people are a potentialthreatwhen they are parents, siblings, daughters, sons,classmates, coworkers and neighbors to the defendants,attorneys, judges, and jurors, as well as those samedefendants, attorneys, judges, and jurors themselves. Arecent study found that one in six people of Generation Z(those born 1997–2002) identified as LGBTQ+.94 While thatis not representative of all generations, (only two percent ofbaby boomers identified as such),95 it is still likely that acourtroom, made up of many actors, would contain at leastsome members of the LGBTQ+ community. For the judiciary,the judge’s chambers would similarly likely contain someoneclosely affiliated with a member of the LGBTQ+ community,if not a member themselves. Judges, clerks, prosecutors,advocates, and other attorneys as well as jurors aresignificantly less likely to think violence is a logical reaction94. Jeffrey M.

MostAmericans today report that a coworker, friend, or relativehas personally told them that they are gay or lesbian,96 making it harder for many to believe that a murderous rageis a reasonable reaction. In 2003, following Lawrence v.Texas, laws prohibiting private homosexual activity were ruled unconstitutional.97 In 2015, following Hodges v.Obergefell, gay marriage became legal.98 In 2020, followingBostock v. Clayton County, discrimination against employeesbecause of their sexual orientation (as well as their genderidentity) became illegal.99 These legal changes reflectchanges in attitudes. In a Gallup poll from 2020, seventy-two percent of Americans polled stated they felt that relationships between two same-sex consenting adultsshould be legal, which was an increase of forty percentagepoints from only thirty-two percent in 1986.100 Whileapproval had steadily been on the rise, it still only was atforty-nine percent in 2005.101 Possibly more telling inregards to potential jurors’ declining acceptance of theLGBTQ+ panic defense, a 2009 Gallup poll stated seventy-eight percent of Americans polled said they felt personallycomfortable when around someone they know is gay orlesbian.102 This may be because so many more people know96.

Judicial Victories Move the Needle In addition, as previously alluded to, three landmarkSupreme Court cases have allowed some of the cultural shiftsto become law. These changes show how in addition to societypressuring law to reflect its values, the reverse is often true.While not eliminating the homophobia that many gay people face, the judicial victories have secured the protection ofcertain civil rights in the LGBTQ+ community. In 2003, the Court ruled in Lawrence v. Texas that U.S. laws prohibitingprivate homosexual activity, sodomy, and oral sex betweenconsenting adults were unconstitutional.107 That same year,only forty-eight percent of Americans felt that gay andlesbian relations between consenting adults should be legal.108 In 2020, that number would be seventy-two percent.109 In 2015, the Court ruled in Obergefell v.

In 2020, theCourt ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees againstdiscrimination because of their sexual orientation or genderidentity.113 A 2019 poll showed that over eighty percent ofAmericans believed a qualified gay person should be hiredfor the armed forces, as an elementary school teacher, highschool teacher, or member of the president’s cabinet.114 Overninety percent of people believed a qualified gay personshould be hired as salesperson or doctor.115 By contrast, in1977, only twenty-seven percent of Americans believed a gayperson should be hired as an elementary school teacher andonly forty-four percent believed a gay person should be hiredas a doctor—especially notable as grade school teachers anddoctors consistently rank in the most trusted professions and are entrusted with two particularly vulnerablepopulations.116 Although these cases do not specificallypertain to the LGBTQ+ panic defense or the hate crimes thatlead to the defense’s use, Supreme Court decisionsguaranteeing civil rights for the LGBTQ+ community showthe changing legal environment in which gay rights issueswill be decided.110.

Legislative Action Commemorates the Lives of Those Slain While some of the greatest strides in fightinghomophobia have come in landmark Supreme Court cases,there have also been strides in legislative action. In 2007, abill extending the definition of hate crimes to include violence against people motivated by sexual orientation, aswell as removing a previous prerequisite that the victim beengaged in a federally protected activity when the hate crimewas committed, was introduced in the Senate.117 In 2009,President Barack Obama signed the Matthew Shepard andJames Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.118 The lawstates:Congress makes the following findings: (1) The incidence of violencemotivated by the actual or perceived race, color, religion, nationalorigin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim poses a serious national problem. (2) Such violencedisrupts the tranquility and safety of communities and is deeplydivisive. (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue tobe responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of violentcrimes in the United States, including violent crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out their responsibilities moreeffectively with greater Federal assistance. (4) Existing Federal lawis inadequate to address this problem. (5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated by bias is that itdevastates not just the actual victim and the family and friends ofthe victim, but frequently savages the community sharing the traitsthat caused the victim to be selected.119 Expanding the hate crime definition to includeprejudicially motivated acts of violence as a harsher category117.

If a person is targeted for violencebecause of his, her, or their inclusion in a protected class, itfollows that that person should receive greater protectionfrom crimes stemming from that inclusion. Committing ahate crime should exacerbate a defendant’s punishment, notexcuse it as the LGBTQ+ panic defense strategy argues.Stemming from this, in the last seven years, several states have also enacted specific bans on the LGBTQ+ panicdefense. Beginning in 2014, California banned the defense,and several other states followed suit.120 Illinois and RhodeIsland banned the defense in 2017 and 2018, respectively.121 In 2019, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, and New Yorkalso banned the defense.122 In 2020, Colorado, New Jersey,Washington, and Washington, D.C., also banned thedefense.123 In 2021, Virginia became the first southern stateto ban the defense, as well as Maryland, Oregon, andVermont.124 In addition to the state legislation enacted,Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey and RepresentativeJoseph Kennedy introduced a federal ban on the LGBTQ+panic defense in 2018.125 After it did not pass, the bill wasreintroduced in 2019.126 In 2020, Democrats gained control120.

Ameritocracy of ideas requires different ideas to be presentedand debated reasonably. Hatred and prejudice cannot bedebated reasonably as they do not come from a place ofreason. They come from a place of fear.The reality of the fear and hatred surrounding thesecrimes is shown in the statistics Professor Lee cites.Although the article was written a mere thirteen years ago,it reflects a very different time period. The attitudessurrounding same-sex relationships have radically shifted.When Professor Lee wrote this article, Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was still military policy.135 The Defense of Marriage Act— defining marriage as legally between a man and a woman— was still law.136 Only three states legally allowed gaymarriage and one of those states, California, would overturnthat decision in November 2008.137 Landmark decisions133.

Moreover, Professor Leequotes statistics from even earlier, including a 1995 surveyof noncriminal young adults in the San Francisco Bayarea.138 In this survey, almost one in five men admitted to physically assaulting or threatening people whom theybelieved were homosexual.139 While hate crimes againstLGBTQ+ people have not disappeared by any means in the time since the survey cited or even since Professor Lee’sarticle,140 the expectation that homophobic violence cannotbe reduced and homophobic views cannot be changed doesnot align with polls showing national attitudes towardsLGBTQ+ individuals.141 Professor Lee writes that the needfor free speech in the courtroom is necessary for the prosecution and jury to discover underlying homophobicbiases that could influence decisions.142 Her conclusion isthat bias is better visible than invisible.143 However,utilizing her previous strategy of substituting race or genderfor sexual orientation, her argument becomes less clear. It isunlikely that one would argue that allowing racist or sexistrhetoric in a courtroom is helpful, let alone necessary, to fightthe underlying prejudice on those biases.Another more recent example of legal scholarshipsurrounding the LGBTQ+ panic defense strategy is a 2019138.

Patel writes that the purpose of banning thedefense to “[send] a message that such clear homophobicattitudes will not be tolerated by our justice system is apowerful and worthwhile endeavor to lend security anddignity to the homosexual community in this nation”outweighs any issues Professor Lee finds with it.145 Patel posits that there are three variations to this defense: insanityor diminished capacity, self-defense, and provocation.146 Patel also argues that indeed the defense should be totallyeliminated, but puts the onus on the legislators to ban thisdefense.147 Patel argues that, in addition to passing the federal legislation already proposed, “[t]hree distinctprovisions should be added to the federal bill: providing forbans on gay panic defenses when used in (1) insanity anddiminished capacity claims, (2) provocation claims, and (3)self-defense claims.”148 Patel also advocates for an exceptionto be made for judges to include evidence surroundingrelevant prior trauma.149 The suggestions advocated by Patelcould be instrumental to fighting biases in the courtroom,but that is not all that could be done to further move theneedle toward justice.144.

WHERE THE LEGAL COMMUNITY NEEDS TO GO State legislatures should pass bans on the LGBTQ+ panic defense. If a person is targeted for violence because ofhis, her, or their inclusion in a protected class, that personshould receive greater protection from crimes stemming fromthat inclusion, not less. It is contrary to reason that a victim’sinclusion in a protected class could be a mitigating factor to a defendant’s crime rather than an aggravating one. It isimperative that state legislatures pass these bans, particularly where bills have already been introduced, suchas in Wisconsin (2019), Texas (2020), Iowa (2021), Nebraska (2021), Florida (2021), New Hampshire (2021), Minnesota (2021), Massachusetts (2021), Pennsylvania (2021),Michigan (2021), and North Carolina (2021).150 In addition,the federal bills banning the defense, S.1721 and H.R.3133,have still not been passed. They should be expanded perPatel’s suggestions and signed into law immediately as afirst step. In the states, the passing of such bills would serve as a concrete human rights victory, as most murder andhomicide cases are tried under state law. For federal law, itwould show a solidified commitment to protecting the livesof LGBTQ+ people. While the previous administration’scommitment to LGBTQ+ issues was questionable, there isincreased optimism surrounding the Biden Administrationand Democrat-controlled Congress that these bills will passand be signed into law. In addition to this step, while the legislators have a responsibility to the millions of LGBTQ+Americans represented by the Congress, the legalcommunity also has a responsibility to act morally anddefinitively for civil rights. The legal community has theability to act without the impediment of statewide reelectioncampaigns in making these demonstrative actions. Many ofthe greatest accomplishments in equality were made through judicial action, and likewise an obligation to actexists here regarding the LGBTQ+ panic defense.150. LGBTQ+ “Panic” Defense, supra note 8.                                                                  2022] FUTURE OF “GAY PANIC” DEFENSE 981This Comment suggests an update to the Federal Rulesof Evidence to make it impossible for an attorney to usehomophobia as a legal defense for violence. One way to accomplish this objective is by adding a new rule to theFederal Rules of Evidence. A new rule could prohibit theadmission of evidence of a victim’s homosexuality when it isused as a legal defense to homicide or as a mitigating factorin a defendant’s homicide charge. This would follow theprecedent of Federal Rule of Evidence 412 regarding Sex-Offense Cases. Federal Rule of Evidence 412 states, “The following evidence is not admissible in a civil or criminalproceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct: (1) evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexualbehavior; or (2) evidence offered to prove a victim’s sexualpredisposition.”151 This rule forbids evidence offered to provethat a victim engaged in other sexual behavior or a victim’ssexual predisposition in a civil or criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct.152 Sexism exists in thejustice system. Irrelevant information pertaining to thesupposed promiscuity of a victim has little, if any, bearing onthe guilt of a defendant—but it could potentially prejudice ajury, and it is therefore prohibited from admission for fear ofunfair prejudice. This type of propensity evidence can distortfact-finding by allowing ugly biases to creep into the courtroom. Federal Rule of Evidence 412 acts as a barrier toevidence that could prejudice a jury.The rule this Comment proposes would read:(a) Prohibited Uses. The following evidence is notadmissible as a mitigating factor in a civil or criminalproceeding involving homicide, manslaughter, ormurder:(1) evidence offered to prove that a victim engagedin homosexual activities; or151. FED. R. EVID. 412.152. Id.                                                                     982 BUFFALO LAW REVIEW [Vol. 70(2) evidence offered to prove a victim’s sexualpredisposition.(b) Exceptions.(1) Criminal Cases. The court may admit thefollowing evidence in a criminal case: (A) evidence ofspecific instances of a victim’s sexual behavior, ifoffered to prove that someone other than thedefendant was the source of semen, injury, or otherphysical evidence; (B) evidence of specific instancesof a victim’s sexual behavior with respect to theperson accused of the sexual misconduct, if offeredto prove consent by defendant or sexual assault bythe victim; and (C) evidence whose exclusion wouldviolate the defendant’s constitutional rights.(2) Civil Cases. In a civil case, the court may admitevidence offered to prove a victim’s sexual behavioror sexual predisposition if its probative valuesubstantially outweighs the danger of harm to anyvictim and of unfair prejudice to any party. Thecourt may admit evidence of a victim’s reputationonly if the victim has placed it in controversy.153 This rule would perform a similar function to Rule 412,by preventing potentially biasing information from reachingjurors’ ears when it has minimal bearing on the likelihood ofa defendant’s guilt. The impact of a rule that makes an anti-homophobic statement, such as this proposed rule, in theFederal Rules of Evidence would be impactful in everycourtroom. This change would be a far-reaching statement from the legal community that exploiting jurors’ potentialhomophobia will not be tolerated as a substitute for soundlegal argument.154 153. See id. (on which this proposed rule was modeled).154. In addition, the next generation of law students should be taught inEvidence classrooms and tested on the Bar Exam that homophobia is not anacceptable argument in a courtroom.                        2022] FUTURE OF “GAY PANIC” DEFENSE 983CONCLUSION While trends show that LGBTQ+ acceptance isincreasing, the legal community has a responsibility to makea proactive statement that homophobia is not an acceptablelegal defense strategy in 2022. The continued use of theLGBTQ+ panic defense shows that although strides havebeen made toward acceptance, including decriminalizingsame-sex relationships, legalizing same-sex marriage, andbanning discrimination of LGBTQ+ people in the workplace,there is still work to be done. In addition to enacting the banssuggested in the federal legislature and in individual state legislatures, introducing a new rule into the Federal Rules ofEvidence to ban evidence of homosexuality as a mitigatingfactor allows those strides toward progress to be achieved.",
