The court determined the campaign violated the elec-tion code and issued it a Class B violation — a 24-hour mor-atorium — in an emergency appeal hearing Tuesday night.The Dimitroff-Guadiana campaign breached regula-tions by providing mislead-ing responses on a ques-tionnaire that University Democrats uses to deter-mine which SG candidates to endorse, according to the UT Supreme Court. As part of the verdict, the Dimitroff-Guadiana campaign may not cam-paign in public spaces, make public campaign appearances, hold campaign events, distribute campaign materials, create new so-cial media posts regarding the campaign or encourage students to vote unless the posts and encouragement are objectively neutral.Co-complainant Taral Pa-tel said he thinks the com-ments of Dimitroff’s team member support Odell’s case.“Dimitroff’s team mem-ber, during the hearing to-night, said he filled out the questionnaire because ‘[he] wanted it to sound good for the campaign,’” Patel said. “This confirms the campaign knowingly wrote that Kallen and Jesse have voted in Dem-ocratic primaries throughout their lives even though the candidates were well aware that was not the case.”According to the verdict, UT Supreme Court reasoned the campaign demonstrated negligence and accuracy was not its driving motivation in completing the questionnaire.Dimitroff said the mislead-ing information was human error and said she and her cam-paign team did not knowingly deceive University Democrats.“This is the purest form of corruption SG has ever seen,” Dimitroff said. “We did noth-ing wrong. We will work until the last minute to make sure students are fought for.”ESB also addressed a complaint against another campaign Tuesday night.Tanner Long, government senior and Student Govern-The University Elec-tion Supervisory Board (ESB), which supervises all campus-wide elections, ruled to disqualify Sa-hil Bhandari and Michael Scott from the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) election Tuesday.GSA President Brian Wilkey filed a complaint last week against Bhandari and Scott for alleged im-proper use of endorsement tactics in GSA’s Longhorn Cattle Call Facebook event and violation of email rules through listserv.Wilkey said the improper use of endorsement tactics occurred when the GSA’s Legislative Affairs Com-mittee organized its Cattle Call event to discuss cam-pus carry on Facebook.  An event advertisement said the event was in collabo-ration with UT Graduate Students Against Campus Carry, an unregistered UT organization, which had endorsed the Bhandari-Scott campaign.  “The Legislative Af-fairs Committee should have never partnered with another organization,” Wilkey said. “It should not look like GSA was endors-ing anyone.” Bhandari felt the cam-pus carry organization en-dorsement did not violate election rules.“It is not a registered stu-dent organization, so I can’t accept the endorsement,” Bhandari said. “That’s what I understood.”Michael Barnes, Cattle Call event organizer and Legislative Affairs Commit-tee director, said he collab-orated with the group after a GSA resolution supported the organization. When a Bhandari-Scott campaign worker published a favor-able post for the campaign Results for state and lo-cal elections and the na-tional primaries were an-nounced Tuesday night after citizens cast their votes on election day and early voting last week. Gina Hinojosa, an Aus-tin Independent School District board member, won the election for the House District 49 race — the district that represents the UT campus and West Campus areas. There were seven candidates in the race, including UT law professor Heather Way and UT alumnus Huey Rey Fischer. Due to the large number of candidates in the race, a runoff election was expected but will not happen as Hinojosa won more than 55 percent of the district’s votes. Since no Republicans entered the race, Hinojosa will be the next representative for HD 49. The Travis County Sher-iff primary results ended with Constable Sally Her-nandez securing the Demo-cratic nomination. Private investigator Joe Martinez secured his Republican nomination as the sole can-didate in the race. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) won the Texas primary for the Republicans and re-ceived 57 out of the 155 Texas delegates available, as of press time.

By Wynne Davis@wynneellynPRIMARIES page 3NATIONALAfter Texas, Cruz looks ahead to long raceSTAFFORD — Major me-dia outlets called the Texas Republican primary for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) less than an hour after voting sites had closed throughout the state, a contest Cruz was expected to perform well in, according to polls leading up to the race. With 80 percent of all pre-cincts reporting, Cruz was declared the winner with 44 percent of the vote to 27 for front-runner Donald Trump, earning Cruz 57 of the 155 Texas delegates available to the candidates, as of press time.Then, towards 9 p.m., Cruz picked up the state of Oklahoma.“Tonight, this campaign enters a new phase,” Cruz said. “We began with 17 Re-publican candidates, and after the first four states, the race narrowed to seven. Tonight was another decision, and the Rachel Zein  | Daily Texan StaffTed Cruz, Texas senator and Republican presidential candidate, speaks at his watch party at the Red Neck Country Club in Stafford, Texas on Tuesday night. Hillary Clinton won the Texas Democratic primary on Tuesday, securing 122 delegates, while her com-petitor, Sen. Bernie Sand-ers (D-VT), received 48. A crowd of over 200 sup-porters cheered at a prima-ry watch party at local res-taurant Tacos and Tequila as Clinton’s Texas victory was announced. “It was a fantastic mo-ment when they announced that Hillary won Texas; the crowd here erupted,” said Dominic Lowell, LBGT li-aison for the Clinton cam-paign. “It was an amazing testament to the energy of her supporters here and the great relationships she has in this state.” Earlier in the evening, before primary results were calculated, Garry Mauro, chairman of Texans for Hillary, a grassroots net-work of volunteers, said a successful night for Clin-ton would show her 40 delegates ahead of Sanders in Texas.“I would say that if we ran a really good campaign and the polls are right, she’ll come out ahead 40 delegates,” Mauro said. “If we have a great night, it’ll be 50 delegates. If it is over that, it’s a blowout.”By those standards, the night was a blowout in Tex-as. Clinton also won Ala-bama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee CAMPUS STUDENT GOVERNMENTBoard votes to disqualify Bhandari-Scott campaignBy Forrest Milburn@forrestmilburnBy Cassandra Jaramillo@cassandrajarBy Ellie Breed@elliebreedBy Rachel Lew@rachelannlewCOMPLAINTS page 2Gabriel LopezDaily Texan StaffExecutive alliance candidates Binna Kim, left, and Kevin Helgren, middle, listen to Tanner Long, right, address the Elec-tion Supervisory Board Tuesday evening.UT reviews executive alliance complaintsCLINTON page 2CRUZ page 2GSA page 2voters have spoken.” Cruz and many of his supporters filled the entire-ty of the Redneck Country Club in Stafford, Texas as they awaited results to come in, with outlets calling the race at around 8:55 p.m.“We’re the ones who elect-ed him to the Senate,” said Mary Feathers, a resident of Kingswood, Texas. “I think that speaks highly of him and his record to hopefully the rest of the nation.”As of press time, Cruz had won Texas and Oklahoma, while Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) won Minnesota — his first win of the campaign — and front-runner Donald Trump won in Alabama, Ar-kansas, Georgia, Massachu-setts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. At press time, Alaska results had not been decided. Last night marked the Su-per Tuesday primaries, when 11 primary Republican states — the largest amount in the primary season — voted all at once for their preferred candidate. The states of Colo-rado and Wyoming are Re-publican caucuses and do not take an official presidential preference vote. While most of the first four early states have only minimal delegate counts in relation to their small populations, the Super Tuesday states provide candidates with the largest amount of delegates to be al-located in one day.Leading up to Super Tuesday, Trump was lead-ing Cruz in almost every state besides the senator’s home state of Texas, while several states remained potentially competitive.“I think there were not many surprises tonight,” College Republicans Presi-dent Madison Yandell said. “Based on what polling was showing, everything played out pretty suspectingly.”Supporters of Cruz argue that if the low-polling can-didates — neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) — drop out of the race, then they would open up support for Cruz.Yandell said even if Car-son and Kasich don’t drop out, Cruz’s next move could be to focus on voters who have favorable opinions of him but support one of the other candidates.“It wouldn’t surprise me if he centered his focus on Rubio supporters, trying to pick them up,” Yandell said.On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton swept every state besides Vermont, the home state of her opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and in Colorado and Okla-homa, states that proved to be tighter races than many media outlets had predicted.“Hillary Clinton had a big night tonight, and her cam-paign did everything it need-ed to do,” said Maliha Mazhar, University Democrats com-munications director.This weekend, voters in both parties will head to the polls in Kansas, Louisiana and Maine. Only Republi-cans in Kentucky and Puer-to Rico will also get their chance to vote this week-end, alongside Democrats in Nebraska.Name: 4478/Arbor Car Wash; Width: 19p4; Depth: 4.5 in; Color: Black, 4478/Arbor Car Wash; Ad Number: 44782Name: 4478/Arbor Car Wash; Width: 19p4; Depth: 5 in; Color: Black, 4478/Arbor Car Wash; Ad Number: 4478Name: 4478/Arbor Car Wash; Width: 19p4; Depth: 4 in; Color: Black, 4478/Arbor Car Wash; Ad Number: 4478CAMPUS Couponsadd yours at texanmedia.org2 NEWSWednesday, February 1, 2016Main Telephone(512) 471-4591Editor-in-ChiefClaire Smith(512) 232-2212editor@dailytexanonline.comManaging EditorAmy Zhang(512) 232-2217managingeditor@dailytexanonline.comNews Office(512) 232-2207news@dailytexanonline.comSports Office(512) 232-2210sports@dailytexanonline.comLife & Arts Office(512) 232-2209lifeandarts@dailytexanon-line.comMultimedia Office(512) 471-7835multimedia@ dailytexanonline.comRetail Advertising(512) 471-1865advertise@texasstudentme-dia.comClassified Advertising(512) 471-5244classifieds@ dailytexanonline.comCONTACT USVolume 116, Issue 111TOMORROW’S WEATHERHigh Low85 50Mohammad raps.COPYRIGHTCopyright 2016 Texas Student Media.

Sanders won the remaining four prima-ries in Colorado, Minneso-ta, Oklahoma and Vermont. Mauro attributes Clin-ton’s success in the Texas primary to her regular visits to the state and the support she receives from Hispanic voters.“Clinton has been back to South Texas regularly and routinely since 1972, and has thousands and thousands of friends all over South and West Texas in the Hispanic communi-ty who have rallied to her side,” Mauro said. “[Ber-nie’s] got no connections in South Texas, and he never bothered to go there. You know what usually happens to politicians that don’t visit places? They don’t do very well.”Lowell said Clinton’s sup-port of the LGBT commu-nity in the past, including her support of the Equality Act, has gained her support. “I’ve been in Austin en-gaging the community with Hillary, organizing block walks and other events,” Lowell said. “Concerning LGBT issues, Hillary is the champion. In the past she has been the one prioritiz-ing and driving the con-versation about LGBT is-sues. That gets her a lot of local support.”Jennie Lou Leeder, can-didate for the 24th district senate seat and event at-tendee, said the excitement of the crowd at the watch party demonstrated the lo-cal backing Clinton has.  “It was extremely crowd-ed — packed, really,” Leed-er said. “It shows a great amount of support here. People were sitting, stand-ing and all-around just showing a lot of enthusiasm for who I think is the most qualified and prepared can-didate to lead this nation.”in the Facebook event, Barnes said he removed the post as quickly as possible.Bhandari said he had no control over the worker’s post, but ESB chair David Engleman said campaign candidates and workers are deemed equally as re-sponsible according to election code.Immediately after the favorable post was pub-lished, Wilkey sent the GSA listserv email to more than 5,000 students adver-tising the Cattle Call event. Wilkey said he was not aware of the favorable post when he sent the email linking to the Facebook group out. “This seems to have cre-ated an advantage to the [Bhandari-Scott] cam-paign,” Wilkey said in a hearing Monday. In his complaint, Wilkey said the event organizer should be held responsible for the communication within the Facebook event, but the ESB did not reach out to Barnes. “[The] complainant [Wilkey] says the peo-ple organizing the event should speak for this — that’s me,” Barnes said. “I was never invited, and I emailed the director of ESB well in advance, and I submitted a statement that could be read, and it was never read in the hearing, to my knowledge.”The board voted unani-mously to disqualify the campaign because of viola-tions in its misleading cam-paign activities. Bhandari said he was disappointed in the court’s decision.“The ESB is attempting to set a dangerous prec-edent by disallowing our candidature, which is the worst possible punish-ment,” Bhandari said.The Bhandari-Scott cam-paign sent an appeal to the ESB’s ruling Tuesday. The next step is for the GSA president and vice presi-dent to convene an appel-late court that would hear the appeal.Disqualified candidates are not on the voting bal-lot, but there is the possi-bility for a re-vote depend-ing on the outcome of the appellate court’s ruling.“The results will not be certified and announced until the process con-cludes,” Engleman said. “If the ESB ruling is over-turned, there would be another election including all candidates.”GSA continues from page 1 CRUZcontinues from page 1CLINTON continues from page 1ment Speaker of the Assem-bly, said he filed a complaint against the Helgren-Kim campaign because it did not report a Class A violation charge — a result of a previ-ous complaint — on their fi-nancial disclosure form.“The Election Supervi-sory Board levied a fine on the Helgren-Kim campaign of $59.50,” Long said. “The Election Code clearly states that all fines and expenditures must be reported on financial disclosures.”Executive alliance candidate Kevin Helgren said his cam-paign did not submit the Class A violation fine on their finan-cial disclosure form but said his campaign subtracted the fine from the total amount and did not exceed that budget.“Executive alliances are allowed to spend $1,023 dol-lars,” Helgren said. “[A value of] $1,023 minus $59.50 means we have $963.50 to spend on our campaign. On our first financial disclosure, we spent $950. After our second financial disclosure, we had $1.09 left to spend.” Helgren said the elec-tion code gives candidates 48 hours after election re-sults are finalized to pay all incurred fines.“Because we have not used the $59.50 and will not use that $59.50, we have not violated the election code,” Helgren said. “If ESB rules against us, we will file an ap-peal immediately.”ESB will have 24 hours to release a decision.COMPLAINTScontinues from page 1Name: PROVOST; Width: 29p6; Depth: 10 in; Color: Black, PRO-VOST; Ad Number: 4504W&N 3NEWS Wednesday, March 2, 2016 3Gina Hinojosa was elect-ed as representative for Tex-as House District 49, which encompasses UT and West Campus, with a 57 percent vote Tuesday night.The trustee and for-mer president of the AISD Bchool Board will replace incumbent Elliott Naishtat, who is retiring because of health reasons. Hinojosa said she will focus on re-forming the education and transportation systems and protecting the environ-ment. Hinojosa’s support-ers gathered at Scholz Beer Garten to watch the elec-tion night results.Naishtat, who attended the watch party, chose to re-main neutral throughout the race. Still, Naishtat said he is happy with the outcome and hopes his successor will fol-low in his footsteps.“While I maintained my policy of staying neutral ... I’m very pleased Gina [Hinojosa] is apparently the winner,” said Naishtat. “I hope she will look at the issues I focused on in the past years. I fought for the rights of … vulnerable, disenfranchised, disadvan-taged populations.”Of the seven Democratic candidates vying for HD 49, Hinojosa is the only one who has held an elect-ed office. Rebecca Cobos, an independent legislative consultant, said Hinojosa’s experience set her apart from the other candidates.“She has a successful record [at AISD],” Cobos said. “To have that back-ground, she’s a mother, a professional woman and I feel she speaks for a range of diverse people. I think she’ll do a good job.”Democratic representa-tives should be willing to reach across the aisle on cer-tain issues, Hinojosa said.“We’re going to need to work on issues where there’s common ground, not compromise, but find is-sues where there’s common ground,” Hinojosa said.Hinojosa, who gradu-ated from UT with a Plan II Honors/Government degree, believes public universities should have the same right as private universities to opt out of campus carry.Hinojosa said she hopes to be appointed to the Public Education commit-tee to increase representa-tion from Central Texas Democrats. Hinojosa also said she would like to be a part of the House State Affairs committee.“We need meaningful oversight of our contract-ing with agencies,” Hino-josa said. “There have been problems with account-ability, transparency and wasteful spending that we need to make sure we’re monitoring carefully.”UT alumna Chelsea O’Hara, former UT Votes president, said Hinojosa is exactly what the Texas leg-islature needs right now.“I think she’ll be a much-needed voice of reason considering how insane it is,” O’Hara said.Hinojosa said the down-side of running was the time spent away from her family, but the experience overall has been largely rewarding.“My most favorite has been really spending time with the community ... and the passion that people in this town have on all sorts of issues,” Hinojosa said. “Reminds me of why I fell in love with Austin in the first place.”By Estefania Espinosa@essie20STATEUT alumnus Huey Rey Fischer concedes House District 49 raceHuey Rey Fischer, a self-identified progressive Demo-crat and candidate for state representative, lost the House District 49 race to Gina Hi-nojosa on Tuesday night.Fischer, a UT alum-nus who promoted stron-ger public schools, social equality and economic jus-tice during his campaign, received 15 percent of the votes, while Hinojosa re-ceived 55 percent. His sup-porters gathered for a watch party at Dirty Martin’s on Guadalupe Street.Prior to Fischer’s arrival, supporters of various ages discussed their political opinions and watched Super Tuesday coverage.Andrew Houston, UT alumnus and associate at Code Studio, said he attend-ed the watch party because he supports Fischer’s proac-tive approach to issues such as LGBTQ rights.“I believe that Huey is the beginning of a new trend,” Houston said. “He is some-one who’s not going to sim-ply stand idly by and let the more conservative side do whatever they want.”Many supporters said they believed the results of the race would lead to a runoff between Hinojosa and Fischer.Jason Taper, member of University Democrats and government freshman, said he believed a runoff was pos-sible and would be beneficial for students prior to the final result announcement.“He’s just so dedicated to getting students involved and pushing student issues that it’s entirely possible that there’s a huge margin for him at the FAC,” Taper said. “We’re just kind of hoping that it goes into a runoff so that students at UT can have a voice in the Democratic Party and in the Texas State House.”In order for the election to result in a runoff, Hinojosa would have had to receive less than 50 percent of the vote.Fischer arrived at the party a few minutes before the elec-tion results were announced. He said while he is disap-pointed in the results, he is proud of his and his support-ers’ accomplishments. “We mobilized students, we got them out to the polls, we got them excited about an election that was local and we let them know that young people do have a place in politics,” Fischer said.At 23 years old, Fischer was the youngest candidate to run for this position.Doug Snyder, campus director for Fischer’s cam-paign and government and finance freshman, said he believes Fischer’s interac-tions with students on cam-pus benefited him as a can-didate in the race.“His network is so clearly evident of what he’s been able to do,” Snyder said. “Despite the results, we’re still feeling like we did something worthwhile.”By Mikaela Cannizzo @mikaelac16Gabriel Lopez | Daily Texan StaffHouse Democrat candidate Huey Rey Fischer hugs support-ers following his loss at an election watch party held at Dirty Martin’s on Tuesday evening.  STATEUT law professor Way loses House District 49 candidacyUT law professor and House District 49 candi-date Heather Way hosted a watch party to see votes roll in for the Super Tues-day election results. She ultimately lost to Gina Hinojosa, an Austin Inde-pendent School District board member, receiving 19 percent of the votes to Hinojosa’s 55 percent. “I’ve enjoyed the op-portunity to run this campaign and reach out to people all around the community and learn about their issues,” Way said. “I will continue to be a fighter for the people in these communities and to be their biggest advocate.” Way’s platform focused on affordable housing and economic equality. UT law alumna Stephanie Trinh said when she was a stu-dent she worked in Way’s Entrepreneurship and Community Development Clinic, which focuses on supporting and improving low-income communities. “I owe everything to her,” Trinh said. “She be-came my role model be-cause she’s dedicated her entire career to supporting and working for low-in-come families. She has the ability to go all in and be a dedicated advocate, which has been her career choice for her whole life.” Trinh said Way sought the candidacy so she could con-tinue to fight for these issues.  “She is in it for the long haul,” Trinh said. “She has no political motivation; she just wants to effect good change for families.” Way also pushed for gun-free classrooms and women’s reproductive rights. Glo Villarreal, a UT alumna and Way’s campaign fundraiser, said she endorsed Way because she chose an academic ca-reer, becoming a staunch advocate for these issues, instead of working for a high-paying law firm. “I admire that she’s been able to have everything — a career, become a leader in the community, a family, a PTA mom,” Villarreal said. “As women, we’re told we can’t have it all, but she’s been able to balance it all very well.”The group was hoping for a run-off because it is diffi-cult to receive 50 percent of the votes — the requirement to win the nomination — if there are seven candidates running, Villarreal said.“Either way, I will still work to pass policies at the Capitol, fighting for the people and not for the spe-cial interest groups,” Way said.  “I’m feeling so much affection and joy from all the support I’ve received from people all across the district who shared my vi-sion and priorities.”By Rund Khayyat@rundkhayyatMary Pistorius | Daily Texan StaffHeather Way, Democratic state representative candidate, anxiously awaits the results of the Super Tuesday primary with her husband Bill and one of her two sons.second when he received 27 percent of Texas votes, com-pared to Cruz’s 44 percent.

Clinton also won Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee and Virginia. Neither the Democratic national nominee nor the Republican national nomi-nee will be decided from the Super Tuesday results.

Hinojosa won the election with 57 percent of the vote.check outONLINEstoriesvideosphoto galleriesdailytexanonline.comPRIMARIES continues from page 1House District 49 elects Gina Hinojosa as representativeSTATEIn presidential primaries, endorsements have consistently been one of, if not the most accurate, ways to predict the eventual nominee, so what’s occurring this primary season is unheard of.Going back to at least 1980, both the Re-publican and Democratic candidates that have the most “endorsement points” — cal-culated by FiveThirtyEight as 10 points for a governor endorsement, five points for a sena-tor and one for a representative — has gone on to win the primary.So if you were to look at points this election cycle, you’d think Marco Rubio would be run-ning away with the nomination. Rubio has 157 points, compared to Ted Cruz’s 34 points and John Kasich’s 31. To put this in perspective, Ru-bio’s endorsement points are on par with John McCain’s at this point in the race back in 2008. In spite of this, Rubio trails a candidate he leads by 128 endorsement points in both national polls and the delegate count.Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner, didn’t receive his first endorsement points until Feb. 24 when Representatives Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California publicly backed Trump. Since then, Trump has bumped his endorsement point count to 29 after securing, among others, former presidential candidate and current New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s endorsement.FiveThirtyEight’s endorsement points only factor in endorsements from sitting governors, senators and representatives, but something tells me Trump’s endorsements by Gary Busey, Tila Tequila and Kid Rock haven’t done much to sway voters.In past presidential primary races, elites have served as gatekeepers of sorts, only allowing candidates to gain support and attention by en-dorsing them; in 2012, endorsements allowed Mitt Romney to pull away and capture the GOP nomination.But Trump has bypassed these gatekeep-ers by obtaining media coverage through the sheer ridiculousness of his campaign, making endorsements almost meaningless.As UT government professor Bruce Buchan-an said, Trump is “taking up all the oxygen” and diverting attention away from other candidates and towards himself.“The average voter might look to the elite in the party like the governor, or the senator or the representative in cases where the selection is not known, or the [candidate] doesn’t feel very familiar and thus would look to elites for guidance,” Buchanan said. “A case like Trump is different because everybody feels like they know basically who he is, what he represents.”This isn’t to say that endorsements are to-tally worthless. Marco Rubio’s poll numbers in South Carolina were at about 16 percent before receiving the endorsement of South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and he finished with 22.5 percent of the vote. But it seems too late for endorsements, or anything, to trump Trump. Since 1988, every candidate who has won the most states on Super Tuesday has gone on to capture their party’s nomination, and Trump did just that in seven of 11 states by press time, pending Alaska’s late night results.So the GOP can endorse whomever they want, but it won’t matter, because Trump is on his way towards capturing the party’s nomina-tion — for better or worse.Ethier is a journalism freshman from Westport, Connecticut.Are you a single Democratic socialist look-ing for a date who shares your commitment to reducing wealth inequality? If so, there is a place for you: www.berniesingles.com — the ideal des-tination for those looking to align their romantic goals with their political ones. While Bernie Singles is not exactly political activism, it’s not a joke either. The site features a space dedicated to donating to the campaign. The slogan “Meet other people who understand the world!” appears in large text. Bernie Singles is just one instance of the grow-ing trend of what can be called the “meme-ifi-cation” of Bernie Sanders, with Sanders himself becoming viral content. It’s hardly the biggest. The hub of the meme-ification effort is a Face-book page titled “Bernie Sanders’ Dank Meme Stash,” or BSDMS. BSDMS currently has over 300,000 members dedicated to creating “dank” memes in support of Sanders’ campaign. It’s hard to log on to Facebook these days without seeing an image of Sanders and Hillary Clinton side by side, comparing the candidates’ views on some non-political subject. Sanders always has a nu-anced, authentic view, while Clinton is depicted as naïve and/or pandering. The Internet has become a bastion of support for Sanders, and the advent of political memes has bolstered his image. This is largely why Sand-ers is popular among the youth demographic, who create and understand the meaning behind the viral images. Memes have become one of the most effective ways to showcase Sanders’ persona as being in touch with the common person.Memes are not, however, the most effective way to facilitate effective political discussion. They rarely give any insight into the candidates’ platforms. At best they touch on the candidates’ personalities, but often they are just cheap jokes at Clinton’s expense. The real danger of memes is that memes and other forms of viral media risk turning a politi-cian, in this case Bernie Sanders, into the leader of a cult of personality. The “Bernie bro” phe-nomenon provides evidence of this hazard. Ber-nie bros are those who have fallen into the trap of thinking that only the ignorant or corrupt sup-port Clinton. They see Sanders as a divine figure, pure from the worldly corruption that has infect-ed every other successful politician since George Washington. This threatens to undermine the democratic process by elevating the politician above their policy. Memes propagate this threat by limiting discussion to one liners. So the next time you see a Sanders meme on your Facebook timeline, remember that it’s OK to laugh. But maybe you should think twice about clicking share.Stuart is a Plan II and business sophomore from Lubbock.You’re probably feeling good after voting yesterday — engaging in the political process and finally getting to support the issues and candidates that matter to you. Too bad that in the long run, you vote doesn’t really matter.Don’t take this the wrong way. Our de-mocracy depends upon the people’s vote. But throughout our nation’s history, the power of this vote has been usurped by political and economic elites. Today, the people are left with the scraps of their former voting power.The limited value of voting exists at both the lo-cal and national levels. At the local level, a largely ignored and troublingly effective means of this is gerrymandering. The practice reshapes district lines to capture a voting base that favors the party in power, with the intent of heavily pro-tecting incumbents in their local elections. The problem is that once this occurs, it becomes almost impossible for someone from an opposing party to challenge these incumbents. If one happens to be a Demo-crat in a heavily Republican district, your vote will never be heard until Congress de-cides to redistrict again. Patrick O’Connor, writer for the Wall Street Journal, wrote about this minimal competitiveness that results from gerrymandering.“Of 435 districts in the Republican-con-trolled House, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates only 90 as competitive,” O’Connor said. “The number of competitive districts [is] at its lowest since Cook first started the parti-sanship rating in the 1998 election cycle.”In national elections, the Electoral Col-lege has taken the power away from the people since the beginning of American democracy. With the existence of the Elec-toral College, the voter doesn’t have a di-rect vote in the presidential election. Each state has a specific number of electors that is proportional to congressional represen-tatives and congressmen. However, the issue isn’t in the indirectness of voting, but rather the Electoral College as a winner-takes-all system. This means elec-tors only go to the candidate the wins the majority vote — however small the margin may be. In Texas, where the red-blue split is a 54–46 percent difference, all electoral votes would go to a Republican candidate. To the Electoral College, 46 percent of voters in Texas just do not matter. Mike Edwards and Danny Oppenheimer, writers for the Huff-ington Post, argued for the elimination of this unrepresentative system.“The primary impact of the Electoral Col-lege is to give citizens of some states more influence over the presidential election than citizens of other states,” Edwards and Oppen-heimer said. “If you happen to live in a [non-swing state] — as do roughly 79% of Ameri-cans … — then you are pretty much out of luck. Your vote doesn’t matter.”Although the power of voting has been diluted into less than it should be, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t vote. How-ever, what it does mean is Americans have to take back their power and put election reform on the top of the political agenda. The American people need to make it clear to politicians that if America is to resemble any form of democracy, the next set of poli-cies must get rid of wthe practices that un-dermine the process itself.Choudhury is an economics freshman from Dallas.At the beginning of Donald Trump’s cam-paign, many of us thought a Trump nomination was a joke. After playing the ignorant schoolyard bully in debates, that amusement intensified, and Trump became the poster boy for cluelessness and an easy poke for humor. Many young people circulated posts around social media that used Trump’s words to communicate a universal feel-ing of helplessness, and one went as far as draw-ing a haunting picture of what he believed Trump would look like naked. However, now that Trump is the leading can-didate for the GOP nomination, this amusement must end. It is time to fall victim to his fearmon-gering tactics and be scared. This man could very easily be the next president of the United States. Over the course of his campaign, Trump has been notorious for his racist and xenophobic views. He has described Mexican immigrants as rapists. His policies include compiling a database of all Muslim-Americans within the U.S. and building a U.S.-Mexico border wall funded by the Mexican government. His behavior has been as shocking as his policies. He has made conde-scending remarks about a well-regarded debate moderator’s menstrual cycle and has failed to denounce a former KKK grand wizard. Despite this, many young people continue to joke about “President Trump.”Psychology professor Art Markman said there are two reasons jokes about Trump remain popular.“Many people deal with scary subjects by us-ing humor in order to laugh in the face of anxi-ety,” Markman said. “In addition, the president of the United States is an office that has a lot of dig-nity about it. By using humor that paints Trump as a clown, people are trying to make him seem unfit for the office.”Tracy Wuster, managing editor of UT’s Humor in America project, spoke on Trump’s increasing-ly sinister representation as his campaign went on. Trump was originally portrayed as “a clown or as a joke,” but “after his statements began to get more inflammatory, Trump was portrayed as a monster … [and] shortly after his comments on banning Muslims from entering the U.S., cartoonists started to portray him using fascist imagery, even portraying direct links to Hitler.”These jokes distract from reality. The nervous laughter needs to turn into action. Last night, Trump’s victories far outpaced those of his rivals, winning seven states at press time. Unless several of his rivals drop from the race, Trump seems to be the only candidate with a shot at winning the republican nomination outright.This man could be the 45th president of the United States. He could go down in history alongside George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. He could be the one who visits foreign countries as a representative of the United States and its people. He is not worthy of that honor. He is not representative of the people or even wanted by many of his party’s leaders. If you do not want Trump’s idea of a great America to become reality, it is time to get serious and stop with the jokes.

GenEnCo performs shows that are distinct for their col-or-conscious casting, jarring physicality and awareness of social issues. Actors often dash across stage or grab at one an-other, practicing exaggerated motions that come from sever-al schools of technical theater. Alumna kt shorb, the founder and director of Ge-nEnCo’s performances, be-came interested in theater while conducting her gradu-ate research at UT. “I was studying represen-tations of race and gender in mostly television but also film, and I kind of realized that, at the time, 2005, there was very little representation of Asian-Americans specifically or of people of color,” shorb said. “So I decided to create a per-formance piece based on that.”Since its inception in 2009, GenEnCo has staged, among other shows, a version of “Waiting for Godot” and a retelling of “Robin Hood” that examines violence against African-Americans. “The Mikado: Reclaimed” is a riff on the famous “The Mikado” opera that chal-lenges its use of “yellowface,” the practice of casting white actors as Asian characters, by casting almost entirely Asian-Americans.  The company’s earlier works aimed to provide a space for queer actors and actors of color who might not have found recognition in typical casting calls. As a queer person of color, shorb said she sometimes found it difficult to audition for tradi-tional roles. “Whenever I would show up to auditions, even if it was for an all-female cast or a kind of different situation, oftentimes the casting people would look at me and not know what to do,” shorb said. GenEnCo’s original goal was to give queer perform-ers and performers of color a place to practice, perform and improve as actors.“Because mostly queer people of color were in the show, people would show up and think it was about that, when actually my whole goal from the beginning — which is why I call it the Generic Ensemble Company — was to create a world that seems completely normal and just let people watch it,” shorb said. “Creative training is usually a little bit elitist and a little bit inaccessible. My company really works to broaden who fits under the rubric of maker or artist.”But as GenEnCo developed, a cast mostly comprised of queer people of color has made it possible to engage with larger societal issues such as racism or “yellowface.” Madilynn Garcia leads post-show discussions at the VOR-TEX Repertory Company, where many of GenEnCo’s productions are staged. Garcia said she finds the most mean-ingful part of shorb’s produc-tions to be the discussions they create and the questions they urge viewers to ask themselves, especially about their precon-ceived ideas of race.“[The shows] ask the audience to also think about, ‘What do I think of the bodies on stage?’ and to keep inves-tigating those and ideas and conflicts and histories,” Garcia said. “I think it’s a step above because of that.” Though GenEnCo’s per-formances swing between the traditional and the uncom-mon, shorb said her main concern is that audience members find some connec-tion with the characters they see on stage. “My first audience mem-bers really are the people who are looking, who really haven’t seen themselves,” shorb said. “And [they] can see themselves in what I’m trying to do.” Name: CLASSIFIDES; Width: 60p0; Depth: 10 in; Color: Black, CLASSIFIDES; Ad Number: -Name: 4489/Church of Scientology; Width: 19p4; Depth: 4 in; Color: Black, 4489/Church of Scientology; Ad Number: 4489CLASS 5Why do p plehurt the on sthey love?FIND OUTBuy and ReadThe Modern Science of Mental HealthBy L.

Since her engage-ment, White has received comments of concern, wor-ried that she may be missing out on her youth — what may be considered the prime of her life. White said her married life has been every-thing but restricting.“For me, I’ve gained ev-erything,” White said. “I’ve gained security — time to explore life as a married couple without having to worry about having kids immediately. I get to do all of these new things with my best friend.” The focus of the youth in America has shifted away from establishing a family and moved toward establishing identity. Mar-riage should be a decision made by those in the rela-tionship, not by the guide-lines set by a societal trend. White said while her early marriage is not normal, it was the best decision for her and her husband. “I think there are so many benefits to being married at a younger age, but it really depends on the person and what they want in order to make it work,” White said. Before they stomped all over the Longhorns on Monday night, the Jayhawks had a little bit of celebrating to do. Kansas wrapped up a share of its 12th-straight Big 12 title with a 67-58 win over Texas Tech on Saturday, and the team pulled all the stops to celebrate the achievement. The players took turns cut-ting down the net, similar to that of the regional and NCAA champions, and brought out all 12 Big 12 championship tro-phies to display at midcourt. “It’s an amazing accomplish-ment — the continuous suc-cess,” senior forward Perry Ellis said. “Thinking about all the hard work and all the hours you put in, and then it all pays off in the end. It’s just a relief and an exciting time.” The Jayhawks’ 12th-straight conference title places them second in NCAA history be-hind the UCLA Bruins, who won 13 consecutive Pac-10 titles in the 1960s and 70s.Weekly AwardsTCU hasn’t had many things to celebrate this season, but sophomore guard Malique Trent earned some conference bragging rights, taking home the Big 12 Newcomer of the Week award on Monday. Trent scored a career-high 25 points, including 19 second-half points, in a loss to Baylor on Saturday. He shot 45.8 per-cent from the field in two games last week along with five steals. West Virginia senior guard Jaysean Paige grabbed the conference’s player of the week award after lifting the Mountaineers to two wins last week. Paige posted a career-high 34 points against Iowa State on Feb. 22, the most for a non-starter in school history. He also scored 17 points in a win against Oklahoma State on Saturday. AP PollHours before taking Texas to task, Kansas jumped back into the No. 1 spot in the AP Poll on Monday.The Jayhawks took advan-tage of Villanova’s 90-83 loss to Xavier last week to take over the top spot. Kansas previously held the No. 1 spot for two weeks in January before falling as low as No. 7. Oklahoma fell three spots to No. 6 after allowing a 22-0 run by Texas in a 13-point loss to the Longhorns in Austin on Sat-urday. Iowa State had the worst fall of any of the Big 12 teams, dropping four spots to No. 21 after a loss to West Virginia. The Mountaineers, meanwhile, jumped four spots to No. 10. Baylor held steady at No. 19 while Texas moved up a couple of spots to No. 23 af-ter wins at Kansas State and against Oklahoma.Texas Tech received 12 votes.The Longhorns will get a different experience for the first time this season.After playing in five-game tournaments each of the past three weekends, Texas will face just one op-ponent — Texas State — in its first midweek game of the season in San Marcos. Despite the break from the norm, head coach Con-nie Clark said it will be a challenge to come back from two days of rest after the Texas Invitational.“The nice thing is we’ll be able to talk about just one team,” Clark said. “That’s the tough thing, coming in from a weekend and having two short days of practice because you are trying to recover the bodies from a five-, six-game tournament.”The Longhorns stumbled last week, suffering their first two losses of the sea-son after falling to Tulsa twice by a combined score of 0-6. But Texas rebound-ed with an 8-1 win over Il-linois and a 5-0 victory over Weber State.Junior pitcher Tiarra Da-vis said those two wins were important to regain their momentum going into the game against the Bobcats.“Especially going into the Texas State series, which is always a tough battle for us, and they al-ways play us really hard,” Davis said. “I think it was great, especially coming off the two losses from Tulsa, to come back out and show everyone what Texas soft-ball is about.”Texas holds a 35-9 advan-tage in the all-time series against Texas State, includ-ing wins in the last 12 meet-ings. The Longhorns took both games between the two last season. Texas State comes into the game with a 11-5 record after losing four of their last six games.The Bobcats sopho-more shortstop Ariel Ortiz will pose a threat to the Longhorns, as she has a 0.404 batting aver-age, one home run and 12 RBIs on the season. Sophomore catcher Sara Rupp and her twin sister, sophomore pitcher Randi Rupp, will also serve as a challenge to Texas. Sarah has 100 put-outs so far this season and Randi has a 1.45 ERA and two shutouts.But with one opponent to focus on instead of five, Clark sees this game as an opportunity to take things light and continue building towards conference play at the end of the month.“I think that’s a real op-portunity for us on Tuesday to go light on the arms but get very narrow-focused on just one opponent,” Clark said. “But it should be a really good matchup and we’re looking forward to it.”Prior to Tuesday night’s game, an early inning deficit was enough to drain the en-ergy out of the Texas bats. With two outs in the bot-tom of the eighth, Texas State catcher Ryan New-man hammered a pitch by junior Kacy Clemens over the right field wall to tie score at four, and it looked as though the trend would continue another game.It took 11 innings, but the Longhorns were eventually able to reverse the Bobcat’s fortunes and pull out a 10–4 come-from-behind win on the road. Texas floundered offen-sively after Newman’s home run, and it appeared that the Bobcats would use Texas’ of-fensive lull to force their way back onto the scoreboard and hand the Longhorns a 0.500 record. But freshman bullpen ace Chase Shugart pitched out of jams in the ninth and 10th to keep the Longhorns in the game until the offense could explode back into life in the 11th inning. After four innings of offen-sive silence, the Longhorns kicked off the top half of the 11th with a hit by pitch, a bunt single and a four-pitch walk to load the bases with nobody out. The Longhorns had faced similar situations in extra innings against Stanford earlier in the schedule and failed to produce. This time around, things were different. Sophomore nine-hitter Jake McKenzie gave Texas the lead with a RBI walk, and then junior center fielder Zane Gurwitz, who went 5-6 on the night, drove home the win with an RBI single to put Texas up two. Texas State lost all pitching composure after that. A two-run double from redshirt sophomore Bret Boswell, followed by a wild pitch and a sac fly off the bat of junior Tres Barrera closed out the six-run 11th and put the seal on Texas’ first come-from-behind win of the season. The comeback win was not the only important first for the Longhorns. Right handed pitcher Morgan Cooper made his first start of the season. Al-though the redshirt sopho-more did not have his best stuff, he was still able to end the night with just two runs in four innings pitched. Cooper showed flashes of the talent that made him a member of the Big 12 All-Freshman team in 2014 be-fore missing all of last season with Tommy John surgery. The redshirt sophomore was able to rear back and blaze fastballs past a few helpless swings, but command and composure were lacking early on. Cooper walked a pair of hitters with two outs in the second inning before sur-rendering an RBI single to Bobcat catcher Jared Huber and balking in a run to put the Longhorns in an early 2-0 hole. But for the first time in 2016, the offense was able to rebound and prevent the Longhorns from falling back to 0.500 before begin-ning its toughest stretch of the season.6 SPTS6JACOB MARTELLA, SPORTS EDITOR | @texansportsWednesday, March 2, 2016BASEBALL | TEXAS 10 - 4 TEXAS STATELonghorns take down Bobcats in extrasSIDELINEBy Daniel Clay@dclay567Joshua Guerra| Daily Texan StaffAfter putting up six runs in the 11th inning, Texas won its first extra inning affair of the season, defeating Texas State 10-4.

During the shot put event at the Big 12 Cham-pionships, Crouser broke his own record with a throw of 21.29 meters that ranked ninth in NCAA history. However, Crouser wasn’t done breaking records. On his final toss of the meet, Crouser tied the shot put collegiate record with a throw of 21.73 me-ters. Crouser’s throw is tied with Arizona State’s Ryan Whiting, who broke the record back in 2008. Crouser is not only atop the Big 12 record books but can now be considered one of the best shot putters in collegiate history. This is the first time Crouser has been se-lected as the USTFCCA National Athlete of the Week this season. Crouser and the Long-horns will finish their indoor season at the NCAA Championships in Birmingham, Alabama, March 11–12.—Mark Skol Jr.SPORTS BRIEFLY“To one who has faith no explanation is necessary!”Javan Felix@JavanFelix3TOP TWEETCOMICS 7COMICS Wednesday, March 2, 2016 7Today’s solution will appear here next issue                 SUDOKUFORYOU7  5   9  8 2 3  9  6  6   4 7 2     4  8 9 1 5 7   7 1  4  1 5 7             3 2  8    7  19   1   5 42 7 1 8 5 3 9 4 68 3 9 4 7 6 5 1 26 5 4 2 9 1 7 8 31 4 5 6 8 7 3 2 93 6 2 9 4 5 1 7 87 9 8 3 1 2 6 5 44 8 7 5 3 9 2 6 19 1 6 7 2 8 4 3 55 2 3 1 6 4 8 9 7First comes love, then comes marriage — but for millennials, this may not be the case.When considering mar-riage, the younger popu-lation tends to wait lon-ger than their parents or grandparents did to tie the knot. A study by the Pew Research Center revealed that in the last 50 years, the median age at first marriage has risen about six years for both men and women. From the study, it is unclear why those in the younger generation are deciding to hold off on marriage. However, the responses suggest the notion of marriage has become less of a priority for many millennials. Al-most four in 10 American adults believe marriage has become obsolete. Sharing the same idea, Sharon Joseph, a rhetoric and writing senior, said the idea of getting mar-ried in the near future is far from ideal.  “I’m uncomfortable with [the idea],” Joseph said. “I’m not sure why I have the impression that a mar-riage will weigh me down, but I’d like to be selfish and independent for a few more years.“  While it may be easy to accuse the “hookup culture” for causing the commitment issues in the younger generation, the delayed marriages may be just a way for millen-nials to be more careful with their future. The Pew Research Center notes that 50 years ago, couples were quick to walk down the aisle due to heavy em-phasis on marriage and starting a family. Now, adults are more cautious of the perils of divorce and are eager to estab-lish their own lives before settling down. “We have heard how di-vorce rates have been very high,” Joseph said. “Tak-ing the time to figure one’s self out in their youth is important. I believe this will lead to a stronger and more fulfilling marriage if one decides to settle down in the future.”Even though the ma-jority of the younger gen-eration is deciding to wait longer than their grand-parents to get married, some individuals adhere to the more traditional time-line. Education junior Me-lissa White recently mar-ried her husband, Parker, at the age of 21. While her marriage may not be com-mon among her peers, White said her decision to get married was a good one, regardless of how ear-ly it may seem to others.“Parker and I are rare,” White said. “I would defi-nitely argue that [mar-rying young] isn’t for everyone, but if you find someone who just lines up with you like Parker does for me, then you can make it work.” In a society that prioritiz-es establishing a career and independence, marriage is beginning to be seen as a hindrance to living life to Nathan Nordstrom remem-bers peering over the shoul-ders of fellow middle school students, anxious to see the graffiti writing etched into their sketchbooks. He was an outsider, a skateboarder from Austin’s west side who yearned to wield a spray can but lacked a mentor who could help him break into the scene. That changed when he be-gan learning to paint from Al “Skam” Martinez, one of the original innovators in Austin graffiti. Twenty-six years later, Nordstrom has become a fix-ture in the graffiti scene with his chosen moniker, Sloke One. While his days of tag-ging the streets illegally are over, Nordstrom has built a career on creating commis-sioned work. His latest show, “Fatcapped,” which is cur-rently on display at Austin gallery testsite, provides an intimate, up-close look at the graffiti style that Nordstrom perfected in the streets. “Most people know me for my Wildstyle,” Nordstrom said. “Wildstyle is the very complex, intricate lettering, very colorful. Right now I’m kind of going through an ‘anything goes’ phase. I’m kind of at the point where I’m trying not to think that much when I paint.”When Nordstrom began painting in 1990, the major-ity of graffiti in Austin was gang-related. Removed from the epicenters of graffiti on the East and West Coasts, Nor-dstrom said he had to learn through trial and error. “I’m going to be truthful — graffiti was dead when I started,” Nordstrom said. “In a way, it was a very interest-ing time, because I kind of had the city to myself. I had to learn the hard way.”Nordstrom said it is only in the last three or four years that he has seen graffiti gain a wider appreciation in Austin. “To be accepted by the public today … it’s nice to be recognized for what you do, but they’re a little late,” Nordstrom said. “What I care about is passing on the traditions and customs and culture to the next generation through education. I don’t re-ally care about the public.”Nordstrom devotes a signif-icant portion of his energy to-wards educating youth about graffiti. In addition to mentor-ing young artists one-on-one, he has taught at the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican Ameri-can Cultural Center and the Dougherty Arts Center. UT alumnus Chale Nafus, a longtime friend of Nor-dstrom’s, curated the show at testsite, which features photographs of Nordstrom’s work and graffiti pieces done on Masonite boards. Nafus said he shares Nordstrom’s aspirations of sharing the art and its history. “I want to spread the gos-pel,” Nafus said. “It’s sort of demystifying. As a critic and supporter, I want more people to know about [graffiti] and support it.”Sarah Bancroft, the direc-tor of testsite, said the pair-ing of Nordstrom and Nafus offers viewers both a history lesson and an appreciation for graffiti. “I think it looks amazing in the space,” Bancroft said. “[Nordstrom] wanted to talk about the history of graffiti in his work: the good, the bad and the ugly. I think that’s what he’s brought, something that people can really take a close look at in a different environment than they would on the streets.”In his profession as a graf-fiti writer with permission, Nordstrom has created work for the likes of Nike, Google and the University of Texas. Nordstrom said he sees him-self continuing to paint for the foreseeable future. “A lot of people say you’re not doing graffiti if you’re not doing it illegally,” Nordstrom said. “My thing is, as long as I’m painting, I’m still painting. I did the streets for 12 years. Who do I need to prove myself to? I have nothing to prove. I just need to impress myself.”Graffiti artist Sloke One brings streets indoors with new showName: 512 Realty; Width: 60p0; Depth: 10 in; Color: Process color, 512 Realty; Ad Number: 42778 L&ACAT CARDENAS, LIFE&ARTS EDITOR | @thedailytexan 8Wednesday, March 2, 2016ARTBy James Rodriguez@jamie_rodMarshall Tidrick | Daily Texan StaffGrafitti artist Nathan Nordstrom’s art show “Fatcapped” is currently on display at Austin gal-lery testsite.
