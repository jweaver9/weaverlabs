EXPLORING INTERSECTIONS OFDISCRIMINATION, SOCIALSUPPORT, AND HIV RISK BEHAVIORAMONG GAY, BISEXUAL, QUEERMEN: A SCOPING REVIEWJon Andre Sabio ParrillaYale School of Public Health, Social and Behavioral Sciences (2023)Primary Advisor: Dr. Raquel Ramos, PhD, MBA, MSN, FNP, FNYAM, FAHASecondary Advisor: Dr. Trace Kershaw, PhDA Thesis submitted in partial fulfillment for the Degree of Master of Public Health in the Department ofSocial and Behavioral Sciences at Yale UniversityYale School of Public HealthYear: 2023UNSTRUCTURED ABSTRACTIn the United States, 1 in 3 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer (LGBTQ+ ) identified personshas experienced discrimination or unjust or biased treatment of people due to their “race, gender,age, or sexual orientation.” We conducted a scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs InstituteManual for Evidence Synthesis. In December 2022, two databases were searched: PubMed andCumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Our review identified 22studies that addressed the association between social support and discrimination with HIV riskbehavior among gay, bisexual, queer (GBQ) men. Stigma and discrimination within and outsidethe gay community was associated with HIV risk behavior. Black and Latino/Hispanic GBQ menwere more likely to experience structural and interpersonal discrimination and social support wasfound to be a protective factor for HIV risk behavior.2AcknowledgementsI would like to acknowledge and give my greatest appreciation to my thesis advisors, Dr.S. Raquel Ramos and Dr. Trace Kershaw who made this thesis possible. Their guidance andadvice carried me through all the stages of writing my thesis. I would also like to thank theRamos lab for providing access to data, research opportunities, guidance, and support.Thank you Dr. Ramos for your unending mentorship, support, and education you haveprovided me with throughout my time as a researcher and health educator at the Ramos Lab. Iam exceptionally grateful to Dr. Ramos and the Yale School of Public Health for affording mewith the experiences and formal training and education necessary to become the LGBTQ+physician I aspire to be. I will utilize the knowledge and the skills I have gained in the past twoyears to serve marginalized populations and work to mitigate the health disparities incommunities of color and in the LGBTQ+ population. I will propel this research and its publichealth, policy, and clinical implications further to fight the social and health injustices thatcontinue to persist today in the communities for which I am a part.3Table of ContentsIntroduction……………………………………………………………………………………5-7Methods…………………………………………………………………………..…………...7-10Characteristics of Included Research Articles……………………………………………10-25Results…………………………………………………………………………..……………….25PRISMA Diagram…………………………...…………………………………………………26Study Characteristics……………………………………………………………….………26-28Discussion……………………………………………………………………………………28-32Implications for Public Health………………………………………………………..30Implications for Public Policy………………………………………………………….31Implications for Clinical Practice…………………………………………………31-32Limitations……………………………………………………………………….……..32Conclusion………………………………………………………………………………….…..33References……………………………………………………………………………………34-384INTRODUCTIONAccording to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sexual and gender minority (SGM)populations include, but are not limited to, individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual,asexual, transgender, Two-Spirit, queer, and/or intersex. In the United States, 1 in 3 Lesbian,Gay, Bisexual, Queer (LGBTQ+ ) identified persons has experienced discrimination or unjust orbiased treatment of people due to their “race, gender, age, or sexual orientation” according to theCenter for American Progress.This has led to individuals changing their behavior to avoid discrimination in “healthcare, employment, housing, and public spaces'' based on their sexual identity. Due to this, in2022, it was estimated that 1 in 5 of LGBTQ+ persons did not seek medical care due to instancesof discrimination. In fact, a considerable factor in HIV risk that plays an important role isdiscrimination as it relates to SGM status “in home or social neighborhoods'' (Frye et al., 2015.)Further, research indicates that SGM living in structurally stigmatizing environments haddecreased uptake of HIV prevention therapies (Oldenburg et al., 2015).Psychological distress and substance use are outcomes of experiences of sexualorientation-based discrimination among LGBTQ+ individuals which is consistent with sexualminority stress theory (Frye et al., 2015). As a result of this discrimination and stigma, manySGM have maladaptive coping behaviors including engaging in sexual risk behavior (Herrick etal, 2011).Intersectionality also plays a role in exacerbating discrimination and thus, increases riskfor HIV. Coined by legal scholar Kimberle´ Crenshaw, intersectionality is a conceptualframework that views how various forms of identity can multiply discrimination and inequalityamong marginalized groups. HIV risk behavior is higher in individuals who have intersecting5disadvantaged identities and/or backgrounds. Figure 1 demonstrates how structural, institutional,and interpersonal levels of discrimination impacts HIV risk behavior among GBQ men of color.For example, researchers found larger relative risks for condomless anal sex among Blackand Latinx SMM (Jeffries et al., 2017). Hypermasculine cultural norms like machismo aresignificantly related to unprotected anal sex (Jarama et al., 2005). Machismo is a cultural normfor Latinx folks that pervade beliefs of gender, sexuality, and sexual behavior (Marin et al.,1997). Intersecting identities of sexual orientation and race can compound to increase HIV riskbehavior. Among all SMM, heteronormative policing (e.g., social isolation or exclusion,bullying, punishment, and professional assistance) was found to be linked to increased HIV riskbehavior (Meanley et al., 2018). Further, Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) are morelikely to report being physically attacked or injured as compared to White MSM (Reilly et al.,2016). Age is also an intersecting identity that can mediate HIV risk. For example, investigatorsfound that Young Black MSM (YBMSM) reported more acceptance of negative attitudesregarding their sexuality and low levels of condom self-efficacy (Vincent et al., 2017).As Scott et al. found, Black MSM did not feel like they had access to social support intheir communities as LGBTQ+ community organizations were predominantly White and thislack of social support was compounded by the hypermasculinity and homophobic cultural normsin the Black community (Scott et al., 2014). This is particularly relevant to HIV risk behaviorbecause those same participants in Scott et al. were less likely to adhere to HIV preventionstrategies and report this was due to homophobia and stigma (Scott et al., 2014). Those whoreported increased social support were more likely to get HIV testing (Scott et al., 2014).The purpose and aims of this scoping review is to examine a) the association ofdiscrimination and HIV risk behavior among GBQ individuals and to explore b) the association6of social support and HIV risk behavior among GBQ individuals. This thesis will seek tounderstand how HIV risk behavior impacts health indicators and outcomes among GBQindividuals.Figure 1. Adapted from Intersectionality Research for Transgender Health Justice(IRTHJ) Framework (Wesp et al., 2019)METHODSWe followed the scoping review methodology outlined in the Joanna Briggs InstituteManual for Evidence Synthesis (Aromataris & Munn, 2020) to ensure rigor and to provideguidance on a structured, unbiased, and robust approach to review of the literature.7Identifying Relevant StudiesIn December 2022, we searched two databases, including PubMed and Cumulative Indexto Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). These two databases were selected becauseof their open access and breadth of content in areas of social and behavioral sciences. One publichealth research librarian was consulted on developing and refining our search strategy. Thesearch strategy for PubMed can be found in Figures 2 and 3.PubMed (Figure 2)8CINAHL (Figure 3)There were no restrictions placed on the publication date; however, we had U.S. basedstudies as part of our inclusion criteria. The additional search terms included: ages 18-34(emerging adults), discrimination/bias, SGM, HIV prevention, sex behavior, sex risk,intersectionality, and gender expression. A second layer of filtering using these inclusion criteriawas done during title/abstract and full text review on Covidence.Study SelectionThere were no restrictions on the study design. We were interested in looking at a body ofliterature published on the topic of how discrimination and lack of social support mediates therisk of HIV behavior among GBQ individuals. To meet the inclusion criteria, articles had to be9(a) written in English, (b) published research studies, (c) focused on GBQ men, and focused onemerging adults (ages 18-34 years old). Published literature that did not explicitly state HIV riskbehavior as an outcome, but involved sex risk behavior outcomes, were included. Exclusioncriteria were (a) study populations that included individuals already diagnosed with HIV and (b)theses, presentations, editorials, and conference posters.Charting and Summarizing the DataSearch results were imported from PUBMED/CINAHL into Covidence. References weregenerated from Covidence data management software. Article titles and abstracts were reviewedby two reviewers (J.A.S.P. and SR.R.).Characteristics of Included Research Articles (N=22)Author, Year, andSampleAge andGenderRace/EthnicityDesign Outcomes

After removing duplicates, wescreened the titles and abstracts of 2,394 articles. After review of titles and abstracts, 2,225articles were excluded and 169 were included for a full-text review. 22 studies were included inqualitative analysis. The Preferred Reporting items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysesextension flow diagram is summarized in Figure 4.25Figure 4. Preferred reporting items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extensiondiagram.Study CharacteristicsThe age range of participants in the studies included in qualitative analysis werepredominantly emerging adults (18-34 years old); however, there were a few studies that wentbeyond that range (n=4). Study samples were mostly composed of men (n=21); however, therewas one study that included women and transgender participants. Most of the studies had26diversity with regard to race (African Americans, Whites, Asian Americans, Hispanic/Latino,and Native Americans). The predominant study design was cross-sectional (n=15). The otherstudy designs included meta-analysis (n=3), experimental (n=2), and mixed methods (n=2). Theearliest study conducted in this review was over two decades ago (1997).One of the most common key findings among the studies was discrimination and stigmawas associated with a higher likelihood of sexual risk behavior. Stress online and from within thegay community was found to be a predictor for sexual risk behavior (Burton et al., 2020); inaddition, discrimination from heterosexual men was found to be significantly associated withrisky sex (Gibson et al., 2022). Intersectional discrimination based on race and sexual orientationwas also found to be associated with HIV risk behavior among a sample of White, Black, andLatino/Hispanic men (Frye et al., 2015). Among Black and Latino GBQ, a study found largereffect sizes for sexual risk behavior including: sex under the influence, condomless anal sex, andrisky sexual situations (Jeffries et al., 2017). A qualitative study with semi-structured interviewssupported this finding and demonstrated that discrimination endured by Black andLatino/Hispanic GBQ men led to risky sex behaviors (Murray et al., 2018). Further, Black GBQwho experienced homophobic events in the past year were more likely to engage in unprotectedanal sex (Jeffries et al., 2013). Latino GBQ were also more likely to report being physicallyassaulted as compared to their White counterparts (Reilly et al., 2016). Further, mental healthdisparities were found in young GBQ men of color which led to HIV risk behavior and substanceabuse (Leiutu-Weinberger et al., 2014).Negative cultural beliefs were found to be associated with increased HIV risk behavior.Machismo beliefs and cultural norms were predictors of high risk anal sex (Jarama et al., 2005).State-level structural discrimination was found to be associated with riskier sex behavior. For27example, men living in states with higher stigma and discrimination against sexual minoritieswere more likely to engage in condomless anal sex and HIV risk behavior (Oldenburg et al.,2015). Black GBQ were reported to have less access to HIV prevention efforts and delayed HIVtesting due to cultural stigma and lack of social support from gay community organizations(Scott et al., 2014).Internalized homophobia had mixed results as it relates to sexual risk behavior. One studyfound that internalized homophobia was a significant predictor for HIV risk (Jarama et al.,2005). In another study, internalized homophobia was positively associated with the number ofsexual risk partners for participants engaging in the insertive sexual position (Meanley et al.,2018).Social and community support was found to be a protective factor against HIV riskbehavior among GBQ men. Greater gay community acculturation was found to be associatedwith lower levels of internalized homophobia (Quinn et al., 2015). Further, a meta-analysis foundthat community involvement was associated with less HIV/AIDS risk behavior (Ramirez-Valles,2002). Social support was found to be positively associated with lower rates of unprotected analsex (Scott et al., 2014). Social support was found to be more beneficial to young Black GBQwho hold strongly negative homophobic attitudes (Vincent et al., 2017).DISCUSSIONThe purpose of this scoping review was to explore the intersections of discrimination, thelack of social support, and HIV risk behavior among GBQ individuals. The key findingsincluded: stigma and discrimination within and outside the gay community was associated withHIV risk behavior and social support was found to be a protective factor for HIV risk behavior.28In a similar study, researchers investigated a study population of emerging young BlackLesbian, Bisexual, Queer women of color, and found that intersectional stigma anddiscrimination lead to negative mental health outcomes (Richards et al., 2018). Social, cultural,and systemic discrimination and stigma lead to these negative health impacts and researcherssuggest future studies must be directed at addressing these disparities (Richards et al., 2018).Due to multiple structures of discrimination, institutional processes, and explicit and implicitbiases, individuals who belong to both sexual and racial/ethnic minority groups are at anincreased risk for negative health outcomes. This scoping review identifies the literature thatprovides evidence to these negative health outcomes as it relates to HIV risk.A study that examined the impact of social support on unrecognized HIV infectionamong Black and Latino GBQ, found that higher levels of social support were less likely to testHIV positive (Lauby et al., 2012). This association between increased social support anddecreased likelihood of unknown HIV infection had two pathways: 1) increased likelihood ofgetting regularly tested and 2) decreased likelihood in engaging in risky sex behavior (Lauby etal., 2012). Social support is an important protective factor because it provides the network andhealth literacy benefits marginalized communities need to access the resources necessary tocombat HIV risk. This scoping review adds to the pre-existing literature by examining theseinterrelated social, cultural, political, economic, and historical barriers in accessing HIVprevention care. The studies in this review provide evidence on how social support is not easilyaccessible especially to Black and Latino/Hispanic GBQ men.The current state of literature suggests that culturally responsive interventions andorganizations have the potential to intervene in the disparities among GBQ men of color’s riskfor HIV. Having social support from peers is associated with more recent HIV testing among29currently sexually active Black MSM (Scott et al., 2014). Black MSM reported access to HIVprevention, apathy, homophobia, and stigma were key barriers reported for not adopting HIVprevention strategies (Scott et al., 2014). Researchers posit that Black MSM may feel outcast incommunity organizations that are predominantly White and thus, contribute to internalization ofnegative attitudes (Scott et al., 2014).The strength of this thesis is that it mapped the evidence on a public health crisis that hasnot been reported extensively in the literature. As of April 25th, 2023, there are 469 bills thathave been introduced to remove human rights protections and freedoms from LGBTQ+ persons,according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Now more than ever, research must focus onthose who are most vulnerable in society. Oftentimes, those who are at the intersections ofmultiple identities are more at risk for public health crises. One way to address these disparitiesis to research solutions that are centered on these diverse populations.Implications for Public HealthRegarding public health, there must be community organizations designed to target forGBQ men of color. These public health interventions will act as a safeguard for this vulnerablepopulation and its inception is supported by the finding that social support is a protective factorfor HIV risk. Having social support from peers is associated with more recent HIV testing amongBlack GBQ (Scott et al., 2014). However, community groups made for and by GBQ men ofcolor are needed to generate peer support and to provide HIV prevention services in order toreduce sex risk behavior among this target population. Higher levels of communication aboutHIV/AIDS was associated with low risk anal sex (Jarama et al., 2005). It is important to createthese groups and organizations to facilitate discussion and improve implementation strategiesthat work to address the disparities in HIV risk among GBQ men of color. Having lower rates of30health literacy and HIV knowledge increase HIV risk in emerging adult GBQ men of color(Ramos et al., 2021). Empowering GBQ men of color with the community groups, education,and prevention strategies are necessary in mitigating the inequities in HIV risk.Implications for PolicyWith the rise of hate crimes against LGBTQ+ individuals and anti-LGBTQ+ legislationbeing introduced in state and federal legislatures, stigma and discrimination among SGM ispervasive and persist today. There is a need to address healthcare disparities among SGM ofcolor to provide a more equitable healthcare system. Based on existing literature, there is a clearlack of LGBTQ+ community-based organizations that reflect cultural humility and serve diversepopulations who come from backgrounds that are different from White and affluent racial andsocioeconomic categories. Funding of these organizations through state legislation is critical inproviding access to HIV prevention care for GBQ men of color. State-level discrimination isfound to be associated with delayed HIV testing and lack of access to HIV prevention (Scott etal., 2014). Structural discrimination was also found to be associated with decreased awareness ofpre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (Oldenburg et al., 2015).State level policies that are designed to criminalize discrimination based on sexual orientationand other intersecting identities are necessary to mitigate the risk of HIV among GBQ men.Implications for Clinical PracticeMedical school curricula must reflect the patient populations’ its students intend to serve.Culturally responsive care is lacking in mitigating HIV risk behavior among GBQ men of color.One way to reduce this disparity is through improving the medical education and training to shiftfrom cultural competence training to culturally responsive care that is sensitive to Black andLatino/Hispanic GBQ individuals. Black GBQ men of color reported having less or no access to31HIV prevention (Scott et al., 2014). It is important that providers, public health practitioners, andkey stakeholders reach out to these vulnerable communities to increase access to these HIVprevention efforts. Sustainable structural interventions include eliminating racially biased,inequitable, and antiquated curricula in nursing, medicine, and public health (Ramos et al.,2021). In addition, increasing the diversity of clinical and research degrees obtained by LGBTQ+Black and Latino/Hispanic persons is a sustainable structural intervention to promote equity(Ramos et al., 2021). Diversifying the provider workforce with people of color and SGM willenhance culturally responsiveness and mitigate the structural policies and institutional norms thatare harming LGBTQ+ persons’ health. Training and education must reflect the findings thathomophobia in the Black and Latino community is endured by GBQ men in these communitiesand contribute to their fear of losing familial support and thus, increase engagement in risky sexbehavior (Murray et al., 2018).LimitationsThis review is not without any limitations. The selection of search terms and searchdatabases may not have been extensive. As compared to systematic reviews, scoping reviewsinherently have bias due to their exploratory scoping focus. In addition, scoping reviewspotentially may not capture studies that have yet to be published. Lastly, scoping reviews do notutilize quality assessment. Studies were U.S. based, published in English, and most wereconducted within the last 10 years. By limiting the studies to the above, this scoping review islimited in capturing the full diversity of how discrimination and social support in differentcultural and geographic contexts impact HIV and sex risk behavior.32ConclusionBy conducting a scoping review, we explored the literature on how discrimination andlack of social support impacts HIV risk behavior among GBQ men of color. There was a lack ofstudies that focused on public health interventions that are specifically targeted and tailored toGBQ men of color. Future research should continue to focus on vulnerable populations withmultiple intersecting identities and how to mitigate HIV risk behavior among these groups.33ReferencesBurton CL, Clark KA, Pachankis JE.

    "abstract": "In the United States, 1 in 3 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer (LGBTQ+ ) identified persons has experienced discrimination or unjust or biased treatment of people due to their “race, gender, age, or sexual orientation.” We conducted a scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis. In December 2022, two databases were searched: PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Our review identified 22 studies that addressed the association between social support and discrimination with HIV risk behavior among gay, bisexual, queer (GBQ) men. Stigma and discrimination within and outside the gay community was associated with HIV risk behavior. Black and Latino/Hispanic GBQ men were more likely to experience structural and interpersonal discrimination and social support was found to be a protective factor for HIV risk behavior",
