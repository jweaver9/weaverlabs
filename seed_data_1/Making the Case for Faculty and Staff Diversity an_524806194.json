This capstone investigates the necessity and benefits of diversity and inclusion training, as well as effective training structures to contextualize the resulting curriculum model. This curriculum addresses an underlying institutional leadership gap at Merrimack College where faculty and staff are not adequately trained or provided with sufficient opportunities to engage in diversity and inclusion training. Feminist Standpoint Theory (Collins, 1997) and Transformational Learning Theory (Mezirow, 2000) provide the theoretical grounding to establish this foundational diversity work and expand it further to create a diversity and inclusion training curriculum for faculty and staff at Merrimack College that dismantles the dominant discourse that sustains oppression, socialization, and marginalization. This capstone proposes initial educational resources that should be utilized as a foundation to adapt more strategic and comprehensive plans around building a more diverse and inclusive campus. This includes developing faculty and staff who are culturally competent, inclusive, and able to subvert and dismantle the dominant discourse. This capstone works to spur development of inclusive educational practices that will benefit Merrimack as a whole.  Keywords: diversity, inclusion, training, identities, discourse  5 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Situating the Capstone  The focus of my capstone is to develop the foundations for a comprehensive diversity and inclusion training curriculum for faculty, administrators, and staff at Merrimack College. This curriculum aims to be the initial education and continuing professional development offered to both incoming and current employees; covering subjects including but not limited to diversity and inclusion as concepts and what that means as higher educational professionals, identity, gender within and outside the binary, race and racism, ability, age, discrimination, as well as the intersectionality of identities and oppression. This curriculum also endeavors to mitigate an underlying institutional leadership gap at Merrimack where faculty and staff are not adequately trained or provided with sufficient opportunities to engage in diversity and inclusion training and education. This capstone is meant to create a dialogue around the establishment and implementation of training, with the intention of spurring campus leadership to integrate diversity and inclusion training within practices and policies, and invest the necessary resources in developing meaningful (well-funded, properly facilitated, and strategic) trainings that can evolve to fit the needs of a changing and diversifying student body and employee base.  Useful Terminology While definitions can be limiting, it is necessary to highlight some terminology that will be woven throughout this paper and the presented curriculum. Diversity in itself is the existence of difference. In accordance with research, conceptually diversity training is defined as “formal efforts to enable development of awareness, knowledge, and skills to effectively work with, work for, and manage diverse others in various contexts” (Bell, Connerley, & Cocchiara, 2009, p. 598). The concept of diversity is directly connected to inclusion, a pairing necessary to understand how individuals navigate society through their difference. When considering inclusion, we mean “a person’s ability to contribute fully and effectively to an 6 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  organization” (Roberson, 2006, p. 215). That contribution is everything from the work they perform, the interactions with others, to their very existence in a community or organization. To go further, we must understand and appreciate that persons have diverse identities that color the lens in which they see the world, influence how they are perceived by others and how they self-express, and impact the structures and policies (both visible and hidden) that direct lives. The personal identities can include one’s gender, race, sexuality, socioeconomic status, ability, age, religion, etc.; the personal identifier we use to orient who we are as persons (Torres, Jones & Renn, 2009). In direct relation, oppression is also a term that must be understood in all its complexities, if one is to comprehend how individuals exist within diversity and inclusion in various societies and communities. For the purposes of this capstone, oppression is:  a system of relationships among social groups in which “one social group, whether knowingly or unconsciously, exploits another social group for its own benefit” (Hardiman & Jackson, 1997), resulting in “vast and deep injustices” (Young, 2000, p. 36).  Oppression operates through individuals’ conscious and unconscious attitudes and behaviors, media and cultural stereotypes, institutional practices, hierarchical power structures and competitions for resources (Young, 2003) (as cited in Mount Holyoke, 2018). There are further types of oppression that are important to know, but would be better served to be highlighted through the curriculum and actual training, as oppression is not the only theme in this capstone, but directly impacts how we exist and interact through our identities.   Lastly, when considering diversity and inclusion training, rhetoric and the language being used within these trainings is significant, so discourse must be considered. Discourse according to Cole (2018) means “how we think and communicate about people, things, the social organization of society, and the relationships among and between all three”. In 7 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  particular, we need to recognize and understand the power structures and institutions in place that lay out how we discuss, consider, and understand things related to diversity and inclusion. Much like our existence in the cycle of oppression, our discourse is shaped by the society around us and we are socialized to therefore communicate and interact with others through these socialized lens (Adams & Zuniga, 2016). It is important to dismantle the dominant discourse that has been institutionalized through systems and structures of oppression, and give learners the tools to understand how to do so.   The abovementioned terms lay the foundation for the larger scope of what this capstone covers: diversity training. According to Bezrukova, Jehn, and Spell (2012) diversity training is “a distinct set of programs aimed at facilitating positive inter-group interactions, reducing prejudice and discrimination and enhancing the skills, knowledge and motivation of people to interact with diverse others” (p. 208). Bell et al. (2009) emphasize the formalization of such programming and efforts as key when considering and defining such training. I will discuss some guiding attributes that help to form affective trainings further in this paper, using these particular definitions to lend clarity to the particular type of training and education Merrimack needs to incorporate into faculty and staff professional development. My research did not locate an established definition for inclusion training, therefore I interpret it as an educational effort that takes a more intersectional approach to diversity and builds skills towards identity development and establishment of cultural, institutional, and personal policies, practices, and actions that create an inclusive community. For the purposes of this capstone I combine the two forms of training to create a more robust and multidimensional approach to an essential institutional commitment. These aforementioned definitions, out of the many I located, encompass the areas the diversity and inclusion curriculum aspire to develop for learners.  8 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Theme and Guiding Structure The lack of structured and integrated diversity and inclusion training of faculty and staff at Merrimack College helps sustains an exclusive and culturally insensitive environment for students, faculty, staff, and prospective members of the community. This paper proposes initial educational resources that should be utilized as a foundation (not exhaustive or definitive) to adapt more strategic and comprehensive plans around building a more diverse and inclusive campus. In particular, I have designed the diversity and inclusion training curriculum as a means to develop faculty and staff who are culturally competent while also developing inclusive educational practices that will benefit Merrimack College as a whole. My discussion of the opportunity for diversity and inclusion training at Merrimack College is based on four central propositions: 1. Merrimack College does not currently have a system in place for structured (i.e. scheduled, resourced, institutionalized) diversity training of faculty and staff, 2. Diversity and inclusion training within an institution of higher education is essential in this multicultural and international world, 3. The lack of diversity training at Merrimack College creates an institutional culture that (1) does not fully embody or authentically live its institutional mission, (2) faculty and staff from traditionally underrepresented or marginalized identities do not feel welcome, supported, or valued, (3) is unable to sustain its diversifying student body, (4) and will stagnate and be unable to grow and remain competitive with its peer institutions,  4. Establishing diversity and inclusion training programs is beneficial to Merrimack College and will develop a sustainable campus climate and community that will support its long term success. 9 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  This capstone attempts to address a gap in Merrimack College’s structure and develop a framework within which to target and bridge the gap in diversity and inclusion, building a more welcoming and inclusive campus community.   To support this goal I will review research and data to build a case as to the necessity and benefits, engage with reported limitations, and provide examples within which I will build initial curricula and programming in support of comprehensive diversity and inclusion training. Secondly, Feminist Standpoint Theory and Transformational Learning Theory will be highlighted as the theoretical frameworks in which I build my curriculum and attempt to guide the learners (faculty and staff) from comprehending diversity and its related concepts to actualizing this learning through inclusion. Through research and exploration of the literature, theory, and existing curriculum examples; I present curriculum in the form of a Diversity and Inclusion Seminar that offers workshops covering a variety of topics including Understanding Diversity and Inclusion as Educators, Intersectionality of Oppression, Advancing the Discourse, and Inclusive Policies and Action Steps. This paper and capstone, a culmination of both research and personal experience as an administrator and instructor at Merrimack, is my desire- as well as my conviction of the necessity- to implement an educational and training effort that will become part of the institutional structure of Merrimack College.   Organizational Background  As the landscape of higher education has evolved and diversified, so too has Merrimack College found itself changing and bringing in students, faculty, and staff from a wider array of backgrounds. Merrimack College is an institution of higher learning that is thriving in a time when many colleges find themselves in much tougher enrollment and financial situations (Fernandes, 2017). Though it has indeed managed to find footing and a niche in an oversaturated market, Merrimack has an uphill battle as a predominately white institution with creating an environment that supports traditionally underrepresented and 10 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  marginalized students, faculty, and staff while also instilling the importance of diversity and inclusion within the fabric of the institution.     Merrimack College is a private not-for-profit college located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, situated on one campus located in North Andover, Massachusetts within the North Shore region. Merrimack College’s 2016-2017 enrollment profile includes an undergraduate population of 3,433 of which 52% are female and 48% are male, and a graduate population of 581 (National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), n.d.). Of its undergraduate population 76% identify as White, 6% as Latinx (terminology emphasis mine), 3% non-resident alien (the terminology officially utilized by the federal government), 3% as Black, 1% as Asian, 2% two or more races, and 8% as unknown. Interestingly, these numbers indicate an overall decrease in undergraduate racial diversity, as the percentage of White students increased 4% from the previous year, Latinx and two or more races increased only 1%, and Black and Asian students remained steady at 3% and 1% (NCES, n.d.). Specific data regarding demographic breakdown of graduate students or faculty and staff is missing from the public website, which gives some indication of the lack of clear picture of just how diverse Merrimack is and therefore what supports need to be in place to support its community.   Anecdotally, from the various departmental and campus-wide staff and faculty meetings and events I have attended in my position as administrator or instructor (the latter which also gives me the designation of faculty according to federal reporting), I have only noticed a few black staff/administrators- which includes myself, less than ten non-white Latinx (not including Sodexo workers due to them being contracted to work at Merrimack through Sodexo), and only a handful of other non-white staff members. Among faculty, it is of note that there are only two black tenure track faculty members and a handful of Latinx and Asian among the 179 fulltime faculty members on campus. According to NCES (2017), “In 11 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  fall 2015, of all full-time faculty at degree-granting postsecondary institutions, 42 percent were White males, 35 percent were White females…” College Factual (2018), an online ranking site for colleges, lists Merrimack as having 88.9% of faculty identify as white, which puts it below the national average in terms of diversity among faculty. There are undoubtedly more, though not much more from what I have observed and heard from both faculty, staff, and students, amongst the adjunct and part time faculty and staff members on campus, but not enough to make a noticeable difference or even have a comparable percentage to undergraduate students in terms of representation (i.e. 3% of undergraduate students are black, yet only 1% of fulltime faculty are black).   Indeed, as difficult as it is to get an accurate picture of racial diversity at Merrimack, it is undoubtedly even more so regarding other areas of identity. A conversation with a queer faculty member recognized the lack of out and visible lgb faculty and staff, with only a handful that she could think of (S. Marine, personal communication, 2017). There is also little to no visibility amongst faculty and staff through identities such as differently abled, trans* or gender non-binary, socioeconomic status, religion, military affiliation, or immigration/citizenship. A lack of visibility can create unwelcome environments for those who do not feel adequately represented (Maxwell & Gurin, 2017). One’s identities seem to be closely guarded secrets at Merrimack, much in the same way the data around diversity and inclusion is. At the very least it is clear that Merrimack College has a diversity problem and this problem means that there are those that do not feel included, but that there are opportunities to improve and create an authentically diverse and inclusive campus environment.  Current Efforts in Diversity and Inclusion Merrimack College has much to gain from the development and implementation of a comprehensive set of diversity and inclusion trainings. Such trainings need to align with 12 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  institutional mission, vision, values, and strategic plan if implementation is to be successful and maintained. All successful institutions have a mission and vision plan, giving reason and power to why the institution exists, what it does, and how it does it (Sinek, 2011). Merrimack’s mission is to “enlighten minds, engage hearts, and empower lives” (Merrimack College, 2017a). In addition, two of the vision statements envision an institution that works to “build a community of scholars welcoming and respecting a diversity of backgrounds, experiences, beliefs and perspectives, and cultivate the intellectual, moral, spiritual, physical and personal awareness needed to make wise choices for life, career and service” (Merrimack College, 2017a). These vision statements speak directly to the need for individuals in the community being able to engage with the concepts of diversity and inclusion, which many amongst faculty and staff will argue is not the case currently. The vision more clearly lays out investment in diversity and globalization of the campus, though remains vague overall in how that comes about. On the other hand, Merrimack’s mission, while expressing calls for enlightenment and empowerment; it is not particularly clear that diversity and inclusion are at the forefront of guiding these actions. With the development of trainings that engage and develop competencies in these areas, Merrimack’s mission and vision will be authentically lived, which is essential for successfully guiding an institution. It is clear that Merrimack still has work to do to truly fulfill its mission, vision, and priorities. The state of current efforts around diversity and inclusion, when viewed alongside the demographical information, at Merrimack College provides further context as to why diversity and inclusion training is necessary. Merrimack is an institution striving to set itself apart from the other private colleges in the region which are struggling to meet enrollment goals or stay up with the academic arms race (Fernandes, 2017; Krantz, 2018). It has found success in enrolling its largest undergraduate and graduate classes the past few years, steadily increasing faculty, and modernizing current and building new facilities. Merrimack has 13 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  aligned itself well within the academic arms race employing costlier, more prestigious faculty members, bringing in more expensive technologies and research equipment, building fancier and costly campus academic, athletic, and living spaces; all in an effort to draw in students. The president has verbalized the intention to moves towards Division I athletics, build and sustain local and international partnerships with businesses and other educational institutions, and many other priorities laid out in the strategic plan (Merrimack College, 2011).  Yet, a particular area is both noticeably absent in the strategic plan and has been neglected based on both personal experience, conversations with students, staff, and faculty, and a noticeably invisible web and campus presence: diversity and inclusion. To go a step further, efforts to discuss diversity and inclusion have been fragmented, incidents related to discrimination and identity oppression create an unwelcome environment for the minority, there is no clear leadership or trained personnel prepared to adequately support diversity and inclusion efforts, and current efforts have relied on the efforts of individuals already stretched thin by their own work and/or school responsibilities or undertrained to properly navigate the complexity of conversations and work related to diversity and inclusion. All clear indicators that diversity and inclusion training amongst leadership- faculty and staff- is necessary.  It is telling that upon doing a quick Google search for “Merrimack College diversity”, the first two links are not a Merrimack website. The first Merrimack link sends you to a page with a brief blurb under Campus Life that points to ways to get involved (Merrimack College, 2017b). However, many of the links are broken and the page fails give a robust description of the actual supports or student-related clubs and organizations on campus (as only one of the seven affinity/cultural groups is listed and with a broken link). In addition, it incorrectly mentions that “Resident Assistants plan multiple programs throughout the year which are geared toward building an educated and cohesive community” (Merrimack College, 2017b). The opposite is true based on conversations with staff in Residence Life, as they were 14 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  unaware such information existed on the website and no such structured programming existed. The tagline on the website of “building an educated and cohesive community” doesn’t seem to actually be occurring with regards to diversity if one is just to look at the few diversity-related pages Merrimack hosts, as many links accessible through Google take you to broken pages, placeholders with generic Latin forming what was supposed to be information, and inconsistent language around it. There are only three Merrimack links that show up in the google search and none of them put Merrimack in a good light if someone was to quickly look for resources or how Merrimack embraces diversity. Instead, it clearly indicates how disjointed or incohesive Merrimack’s strategy, and lack thereof, around diversity is.  Both faculty and staff struggle to integrate diversity and inclusion into their work. For example, First Year Experience (FYE) instructors (comprised of both faculty and administrators) and their student instructors teach a ten week course that introduces new freshman and transfer students to the campus, its resources, and general success tools. However, the topic of diversity is outsourced to an external speaker to give a talk (no more than a few hours) on a related subject and is only covered in class as a quick recap of the speaker. This was a result of recognizing the lack of cultural competency that FYE instructors and student assistants had that made them inadequately prepared to lead such programming. However, this also calls attention to the problematic recognition that some faculty and staff do not appear to have been pushed to collaborate with or had awareness of available resources like Social Justice or Women and Gender Studies faculty members, affinity groups, or even external groups. At the very least FYE provides some opportunity for students (and instructors, as they are invited to attend as well) in regards to diversity and inclusion, but it is not enough. Different departments engage in diversity training in different ways and the frequency or availability depends greatly. Conversations amongst students, faculty, and staff lament an 15 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  overall lack of knowledge and cultural competency amongst faculty and staff. Students and faculty, particularly those with minority identities, speak of encountering microagressions in the classroom. Bias incidents occur in residence halls and other common spaces and students have remarked that they feel that staff have inadequately handled them or left them feeling unsupported and unwelcome. In my many conversations around diversity on campus, both faculty and staff agree regarding the overall lack of diversity training and cultural competency. There is no shared documentation around best practices in the classroom, no structured training during orientation or departmental trainings and professional development retreats, and no clear guidance for faculty and staff who come from various educational levels, upbringings, and cultural awareness. Internal data pertaining to diversity and inclusion remains scarce and hidden, creating an interesting picture of how institutional policies, practices, and programming may or may not be driven through data and evidence. Leadership are indeed taking steps to bring diversity and inclusion into the conversation, often through the push of student voices and perceptions, however, as these changes are fairly all recent, it remains difficult to quantify and qualify how affective they are.   Merrimack College has taken positive and proactive movements towards diversity and inclusion. Merrimack has recently taken steps to involve the campus in various aspects of diversity and inclusion; with students, faculty, staff, and leadership engaging with it in various forms. For example: the network of student, staff, and faculty volunteers who provide Safe Zone training. This group has worked to increase awareness around sexuality and gender through their trainings offered during departmental and staff meetings. The Office of Multicultural Initiatives (OMI) is another such action step, indicating an understanding for the need for resources to be allocated to diversity and inclusion for a campus that is both supporting and becoming (slowly) more multicultural. The OMI could serve as the center for efforts around recruitment, yielding, and retention of students, faculty, and staff on 16 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Merrimack’s campus. However the short history (only established in 2016) and lack of resources (only one full time administrators who runs this “office” as a secondary job responsibility) of the office indicates a lack of direction and strategic understanding of the necessity of supporting diversity and inclusion through physical space and staffing. The Office of Multicultural Initiatives does not currently have a mission, vision, policies, or practices available for the public or even internal gaze via Merrimack’s website. However, the office is working to resolve these issues, working to fill in a gap in support and resources.  The OMI has taken steps to involve the work (both volunteer and paid) of students, staff, and faculty to direct diversity and inclusion initiatives and start trainings for student leaders and staff. For example, after conversations with an advisor who mentioned many of her black student athletes confessing to being negatively impacted by microagressions and bias incidents in their residence halls, I, in my volunteer capacity as Admission Diversity Liaison, brought the need for understanding what tools and protocols were in place through Residence Life to handle such situations. A microagression training was thus developed with OMI and faculty members from the Clinical and Mental Health Counseling that took place during the spring orientation of Residence Life student leaders, and made sure to include the staff members as both facilitators and participants. Responses from the related surveys were largely positive, requesting more diversity related training, most individuals feeling more confident recognizing and reacting to bias-related incidents, and having a greater understanding of microagressions and their impacts. This training has already spurred discussion from Student Affairs around future possible trainings for the staff and student leaders around different topics in diversity, but also highlights the lack of resources available to build structured diversity and inclusion trainings, as reliance on the continued volunteerism of faculty and staff, as with Safe Zone, is not reasonable or sustainable. 17 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  The general policies and practices at Merrimack are often reactive, and work around diversity and inclusion is no exception. Merrimack has undoubtedly taken steps to improve diversity on campus through various means but must strategically and proactively expand current research, develop missing tools and resources, and integrate the needs of the campus community (with traditionally underrepresented and marginalized at the forefront). The proposed diversity and inclusion training curriculum provide proactive tools to supplement the work currently occurring and close a gap in current diversity and inclusion initiatives. A supported, evidence-based diversity and inclusion training, as I will establish below in this literature review, is necessary and beneficial to Merrimack College and will develop a sustainable campus climate and community that will support its long term success. Necessity and Benefits of Diversity and Inclusion Training I reviewed journals, articles, and corporate and higher education institutional websites from recent years to determine the needs and benefits of diversity and inclusion training at the national/corporate level, institutional (peers) level, and internal (Merrimack) level. In addition, I reviewed research and utilized anecdotal information to identify additional motivations within higher education that diversity and inclusion training positively impacts.  Why is diversity training of faculty and staff needed at Merrimack College? Evidence supports the need for diversity and inclusive education to be mandated as part of faculty and staff training (Cocchiara et al., 2010; Moriña & Carballo, 2017).The benefits cannot be understated, as they vastly outweigh possible limitations or negatives. Yet, why is there a lack of structured and integrated diversity training in organizations, particularly ones that operate through a business mindset, like Merrimack? According to Alhejji, Garavan, Carbery, O’Brien, and McGuire (2016), “employers are reluctant to invest in diversity training because they lack awareness of the benefits of such practices” (p. 98). In outlining the multitude of reasons that support creation and implementation of diversity training, it is necessary to 18 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  investigate the literature; which focus on a few key areas: benefits, outcomes, types of trainings, and implementation strategies.  National and Corporate Impact Diversity trainings have taken root in the government, private, and public sectors as leaders recognize the necessity to create a more diverse workforce that can serve an increasingly diverse population of constituents, customers, and stakeholders. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (n.d.) notes: “diversity and inclusion increase an agency’s capacity to serve and protect people who have different experiences or backgrounds and enhance its ability to be receptive to different traditions and ideas”. Training in these areas, therefore, can serve to increase the cultural awareness and competency of employees, diversify the workforce, and improve how individuals and communities from marginalized or traditionally underrepresented identities are served, supported, and included.  Diversity training is a multi-billion dollar business in corporate America and one that companies pay particular attention to. This is due to past and recent internal and external lawsuits, employee whistleblowing due to discriminatory workspaces, as well as an increased outcry and consumer backlash that adversely impacts the image, loyalty, and bottom line resulting from bias-related incidents by employees to culturally insensitive advertisements (Anand & Winters, 2008; Dobbin & Kalev, 2016). Companies, government agencies, and non-profit organizations are looking at the return on investment in engaging in these initiatives and attempting to proactively establish some form of diversity and inclusion training, whether truly effective or not. Research indicates the possibility that lack of diversity in the workplace directly relates to minority employees having greater negative job performance than their white peers and work environments being less welcoming and inclusive (Jin, Lee & Lee, 2017). However, organizations that incorporate both diversity policy (including diversity and inclusion training) and diversity management within 19 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  leadership, positively affect organizational culture, work performance for staff, and the financial bottom-line (Jin, Lee & Lee, 2017; Thakrar, 2017). This calls attention to the need for diversity policy that integrates diversity and inclusion training as part of work culture in order to create an inclusive office/campus environment. The need of some form of diversity training is clear, and organizations and companies are coming around to including it as professional and leadership development of their staff.   Nationally, the need for diversity and inclusion initiatives and training to be institutionalized at the government, corporate, and business level is becoming clearer as more information and research is indicating a need for something to increase personal and institutional awareness around discrimination and oppression. Literature indicates an overall increase in racial, lgbtqia, religious, and other non-dominant identity discrimination and harassment in the classroom, higher education institutions, and society in general (Bauman, 2018; Cantor et al., 2015; Cocchiara et al., 2010). Cocchiara et al. (2010) note that increases in discriminatory behaviors make a case for the necessity of diversity and social justice training of faculty and staff, in particular. The same case can be made for government, corporate, and business. In 2016, 1300 hate crimes (defined by the federal government as “acts of physical harm and specific criminal threats motivated by animus based on race, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability”) were reported on college campuses across the nation (Department of Education, 2018; Department of Justice, 2018). This number has being on a steady upward trajectory, with the past five years averaging around 995 reported incidents. This increase is also a problematic reality for those hidden or not automatically visibly discernable identities (religion, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and ability) that are often neglected in the conversation. Bell, Özbilgin, Beauregard and Sürgevill (2011), for example, characterize discrimination against LGBT identities as “the last acceptable 20 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  prejudice”, based on how sexuality and gender non-conforming identities have historically remained inadequately protected via the legal system and actors of oppression do not face the same type of legal and societal repercussions by being discriminatory towards those on gender and sexuality spectrums as they may against other identities. Bauman (2018) reports, “campus crimes in which gender identity was the motivating factor also rose in 2016, with 50 cases reported”. While Nicolazzo (2017) found: “Trans* college students, who may have unsupportive families or may be otherwise dependent on federal financial aid to attend and persist in higher education, also face significant barriers to accessing necessary funding” (p. 34). These examples of discrimination create a culture of individuals covering or hiding their identities to escape the pressures of having to be the voice of that identity and escape discriminatory and unwelcome behavior, which research has shown can lead to individuals not feeling apart of their community, feeling othered, have less job satisfaction, and being more likely to leave (Bell, Özbilgin, Beauregard, & Sürgevill, 2011). The abovementioned outcomes can begin to be mitigated with intentional, strategic, and integrated diversity and inclusion training at all levels and areas of government, corporate, education, and business; ensuring that the voices and experiences of the marginalized are brought to the forefront of discourse and no longer hidden or (consciously or unconsciously) ignored. Status of Peer Institutions Merrimack College is an institution, not on an island siloed from the realities of competition in the higher education sector, and must institutionalize policies and processes that keep it competitive with its peer institutions. The lack of diversity training at Merrimack College creates an institutional culture that will stagnate and be unable to grow and remain competitive with its peer institutions. We are seeing an increase in racial, gender, ability, religious, and socioeconomic diversity amongst students, faculty, and staff on college 21 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  campuses (Stanley, 2010; Ukpokodu, 2010), and colleges must adjust and evolve their policies, practices, and campus cultures to support this.  Larger organizations generally have more resources to put towards diversity training while small/medium organizations may not. This can lead to the former having personnel and resources devoted to creation and implementation or outsourcing diversity and inclusion work to expensive consultants, while the latter relies on less structured in-house resources with no designated personnel to oversee, sustain, and assess (Cocchiarra et al., 2010). However no matter the size of institution, it is important to have diversity and inclusion initiatives that support or focus not only on the students, but also the faculty and staff. In addition, if one was to be a perspective or current faculty or staff member from a traditionally underrepresented or marginalized community, seeking diversity initiatives that support them, it is important for them to be apparent and easily accessible if such initiatives exist. From both personal and anecdotal experience, the presence and communication of available diversity and inclusion initiatives and support can go a long way to helping faculty and staff from traditionally underrepresented and marginalized identities integrate into campus life and culture. I reviewed several of our closest competitors to gauge what initiatives and support for faculty and staff were available. Some institutions provided a more robust offering of training and educational opportunities such as Assumption which offers conversations on race for faculty and staff, diversity trainings, and workshops by experienced staff (Assumption College, 2018). Stonehill College offers an annual half-day Conference on Diversity and Inclusion for faculty, staff, and students (Stonehill College, 2018). Providence College, based on the limited information I was able to find, provides some conversations and professional development for faculty and staff but most noted initiatives are focused on students. Also, it was unclear from the information found how recent these trainings were offered (Providence College, 2018). According to their website, Bridgewater State provides faculty pedagogical 22 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  and learning developmental offerings, faculty learning communities, and a day-long seminar (Bridgewater State University, n.d.). Fairfield State offered, according to their website, a Safe Space Ally Training but I was unable to locate any other diversity and inclusion trainings for their faculty and staff (Fairfield State University, 2018). These colleges, some with clearer examples, offered opportunities for their staff and faculty to engage with diversity and inclusion education and professional development in some manner. On the other hand, some colleges may indeed provide such trainings but it was unclear or completely missing from the website. Roger Williams University’s website, for example, was unclear on what current opportunities they have, however they did offer a summit on diversity and inclusion that included faculty and staff suggestions for more related professional development and training opportunities (Roger Williams University, 2018). Based on searches, I was unable to find clear evidence of faculty and staff focused education or professional development at Bryant University, Endicott College, Quinnipiac University, or Saint Anselm. However, these colleges did at least offer some form of support and initiatives for students, some more than others- which could relate to size or student demographics, but this indeed shows a gap. Clearly institutions of higher education have work to do to adequately engage with diversity and inclusion, and this sampling of schools show only a small picture of local school offerings and opportunities. There is clearly an opportunity for Merrimack to fill that gap in diversity and inclusion training for faculty and staff, becoming a model institution for peer to emulate, and leading the way amongst its peers in positive transformational change.  Internal Impact While Merrimack often feels like it exists in its own bubble and is not burdened by the goings on of the outside world, realistically it is somewhat a community, though not necessarily a microcosm, reflecting the realities of the larger society. In particular, it is not a 23 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  campus excluded from identity-based charged incidents, discrimination, and micro- and macroagressions. Data on Merrimack College indicates a positive campus experiences, as no incidents are highlighted on the DOE’s website, but anecdotally we know this is not truly a full picture of campus community experiences. While these incidents may not be violent or through physical means; microagressions, insults, and discriminatory behavior appears to be on the rise at Merrimack College, worryingly following these national trends (Department of Education, 2018). Conversations with students, faculty, and staff reiterate a need for support, including better educated students, faculty, and staff. Implementing diversity and inclusion training can go a long way in showing that Merrimack College is serious about supporting the needs of its increasingly diverse campus and is paying attention. Indeed, in alignment with the abovementioned benefits from the corporate and government lens, there are many benefits to the implementation of diversity and inclusion training for faculty and staff at Merrimack. With an increase of bias incidents on campuses across the nation, it is sensible for Merrimack to get ahead of possible backlash or a potential situation that brings bad publicity to the campus and further erodes the welcoming environment faculty and staff work to establish for all. These trainings have an opportunity of decreasing bias, discriminatory behavior, increasing awareness, and creating more culturally sensitive and competent leadershipiversity is a complex issue and individuals within the Merrimack community navigate with a variety of identities, social and cultural baggage, and experiences that inform their knowledgebase and levels of awareness. Creating diversity and inclusion trainings for faculty and staff can serve to bridge the divides that often exist due to these identities and experiences and create a more inclusive campus where individuals better understand each other. Diversity and inclusion trainings, done correctly, are critical and do work. Evidence shows that diversity training improves knowledge of concepts for faculty and staff, while also 24 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  increasing their confidence in these areas (Cunningham, 2012; Moriña & Carballo, 2017). Faculty who have engaged in such trainings notes how essential it was for pushing them to change their curriculums to be more inclusive, gave them the confidence to grapple with concepts in order to feel that they could change their curriculums, and assisted them with having skills to better engage pedagogically in and out the classroom (Moriña & Carballo, 2017). As Moriña and Carballo (2017) so eloquently state: “secondly, it is not enough just to be well-informed. Faculty members also need to be well-trained” (p. 81). When trainings are specialized, the learning may become more effective to improve pedagogy or work style. These topics are ones faculty and staff, particularly from dominant groups, have little prior access or contact with. Faculty and staff will gain more confidence in these topics and then be confident in how they handle situation, orient their work, and engage with those around them; building a more inclusive environment. In addition, another benefit of training is faculty improved willingness and ability to better orient their curriculums to be more inclusive and cognizant of the need to consider diversity (Moriña & Carballo, 2017). These outcomes will undoubtedly improve student outcomes and feelings of welcome in and out of the classroom.  More knowledgeable, aware, and well-trained faculty can only benefit Merrimack. Faculty are likely not trained in concepts in diversity and inclusion. Trainings and professional development at institutions are often voluntary and focused on their disciplines (Moriña & Carballo, 2017). If topics of diversity are covered as part of faculty development, they will usually focus on the hot button topics of racism, sexuality, and sexism; leaving out lesser discussed subjects like ability, socioeconomic status, gender, age, religion, inclusivity, and social justice- all topics that can affect the lives of their students, colleagues, and themselves. With the integration of diversity and inclusion training and education as part of the orientation and professional development retreats, faculty and staff at Merrimack will 25 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  have better understanding of concepts of diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice and increases the likelihood of increased diversity amongst faculty, staff, and students.  Through proper training, there is also increased possibility of retention of faculty and staff from traditionally underrepresented identities, as they will more likely feel supported and valued (Cocchiara et al., 2010; Lirio, Lee, Williams, Haugen, & Kossek, 2008). These trainings will provide individuals with the tools to question the campus environment and opportunities to make it more inclusive for both students and employees through such questions as: does the faculty and staff look like it corresponds to nationwide percentages of faculty representation? Does the campus look like the community it serves or the area it geographically exists within? Such questions can provide the catalyst for positive cultural change, an institutional shift, and the development of a more supportive and inclusive environment. Increasing the diversity of staff undoubtedly has many benefits. A more diverse set of faculty and administrators, and staff members will also bring a diversity in experiences, leadership and group work styles, decision-making methods, and vision (Cocchiara et al., 2010). This will offer opportunities to move past the status quo and challenge what has always been done. This is doubly true when considering the status quo around diversity and inclusion at institutions of higher learning. As evidenced in the sections above, diversity and inclusion training will help Merrimack College more authentically engage in diversity, inclusion, and social justice. Faculty and staff from traditionally underrepresented groups also may feel unsafe or unwelcome in the classroom or work space. They may not find a community amongst their peers, especially in predominantly white and male dominated spaces, who understand what they may experience in the classroom (lack of respect from students and micro/macroagressions), workspace (lack of respect from colleagues), or find their employer/place of work to be an unwelcoming environment (harassment rampant and/or 26 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  unequal access to opportunities) (Bell et al., 2011; Maxwell & Gurin, 2017). Research suggests that integration of minority and underrepresented voices into decision-making and policy making processes creates a more inclusive workplace (Fujimoto, & Härtel, 2017). However, in order to develop opportunities for these voices to be heard, leadership must be aware of the need to even include these voices and why their input is essential; a knowledgebase that diversity training can assist in developing. Faculty members play a key role in establishing a welcoming and inclusive classroom dynamic. Faculty inability or unwillingness, whether due to intentional or unconscious bias, to create these environments can negatively impact student experience, particularly amongst individuals from traditionally underrepresented or oppressed identities (Maxwell & Gurin, 2017; Moriña & Carballo, 2017). Classrooms can become unwelcoming environments for both students and even faculty from minority and underrepresented identities when conversations around diversity, discrimination, and oppression take place if facilitators are not properly trained or aware of subject matter. These conversations may be part of the course content or as a reaction to it; which often lead to individuals in the aforementioned identity groups being singled out to explain or teach (i.e. a connection is made to immigration and a faculty member asks a Hispanic student their opinion) or being discriminated against via micro and macroagressions. According to Maxwell & Gurin (2017), “some students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, report that classrooms are among the most difficult spaces on campus” (p. 10); calling attention to the need for trainings that give faculty the awareness and knowledge to construct and maintain more inclusive learning spaces. Current Limitations Currently the research and data around diversity and inclusion training is incomplete and heavily influenced by corporate culture. Instead we see the majority of diversity trainings working in silos and collaboration between corporate (where most of the information lies) and 27 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  education organizations is not common (Bezrukova et al., 2012; Kaltenbaugh, Parsons, Brubaker, Bonadio & Locust, 2017). There is a lack of curriculum or structured templates that individuals can work from, which speaks to the complexity and diversity, for lack of a better word, of diversity and inclusion in itself. While this allows for flexibility and creativity in creation and implementation of training, it also can be a barrier for facilitators with little experience.  The existence of diversity is not enough to ensure the existence of diversity training or that those trainings are adequate. Organizations and individual departments that have more diverse staff and faculty are more likely to have diversity training in place as part of onboarding and/or professional development (Cocchiara et al., 2010; Cunningham, 2012). However, the increased visible diversity does not guarantee inclusion in the workplace or inclusive policies and practices. In addition, diversity is often looked at on the surface level, via identities we can see. Therefore, trainings may be developed based on perceived student body or target group but not be inclusive of all types of diversity, particularly the hidden or not automatically visibly discernable (i.e. religion, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, ability) (Bell et al., 2011; Maxwell & Gurin, 2017). The visible identities are more easily definable for determining policies, discrimination and stereotyping, or quantifying “diversity problems”. For example, Bell et al. (2011) observe that “partly due to their invisibility, overt discrimination, and lack of widespread protective legislation, GLBT employees are at high risk of silencing at work” (p. 132). Facilitators of diversity and inclusion trainings must be critically vigilant that they are incorporating trainings and education that focus on hidden identities as well as the visible. Another limitation that might impede the implementation of diversity training is potential or present backlash or negative opinions amongst leadership, faculty, and/or staff. However, while these voices, which are often from those in the majority or more privileged 28 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  identity groups, should be taken into consideration, they must not be used as an excuse to block or remove necessary resources for diversity training (Cocchiara et al., 2010; Cunningham, 2012; Dobbin & Kalev, 2016). Indeed, such opinions may be useful for further supporting why diversity training is needed. These voices can be an opportunity to create discourse regarding why such opinions exists, what this means for those with less or non-privileged identities who may feel opposite and thus unwelcome, strategies to move dissenters to recognizing the necessity and thus transferring the gained knowledge in both their conversations with other of previous like-opinions and in their work, and how all voices can be included without dissenters derailing or limiting actual implementation.  Leadership may push the argument that it does not work, noting that many organizations and businesses still see harassment and discriminatory incidents occur even with diversity training (Bell et al., 2011; Cocchiara et al., 2010; Dobbin & Kalev; 2016). Cocchiara et al. (2010) note that even with organizations and businesses having annual diversity trainings, bad behavior is still seen amongst executives, citing Lockheed Martin and Nine West Footwear companies as examples. However, this points to how trainings needs to be done and structured in such a way to make it effective. This includes buy-in from executive leadership, management, supervisors, and other levels of leadership that diversity training is important (Smith & Weidman Powers, 2016; Society for Human Resource Management, 2017; Stanley, 2010). If the institution is not committed or willing to make diversity and inclusion trainings a priority, faculty and staff will take note and be less inclined to willingly participate or support.   Many departments or institutions may find budgetary constraints as rationale for not having or continuing diversity and inclusion training. Departments or areas that are not income generating may find such trainings outside of their capabilities due to budget restrictions or preferences to monetarily support other efforts (Cunningham, 2012). Indeed 29 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  many enrollment dependent institutions can also use the excuse of tight budgets due to lower enrollment or loss of students. However, this is instead an opportunity to show the financial benefits of such trainings, as they have been shown to improve student, staff, and faculty retention (Cocchiara et al., 2010; Lirio et al., 2008). The short term financial costs for developing and implementing these trainings are less costly than the long term impacts of a culturally insensitive campus community.  In addition to and because of budgetary constraints, the lack of available internal individuals willing and able to develop, implement, and facilitate the trainings can negatively impact the establishment and sustainability of diversity and inclusion trainings. Institutions would need to look at external, costly consultants and trainings that may not know the internal culture, dynamics, and needs of the institutions as well as internally situated individuals would. Or, this could force reliance on a small group of staff or faculty, often volunteers, who could face burnout, lack time to devote due to their work and life responsibilities, or not have the knowledgebase or experience necessary to facilitate impactful trainings (Smith & Weidman Powers, 2016). If there is a lack of diversity within the available internal staff, voices and experiences may be missing in the very trainings that seek to create opportunities for inclusivity.   Lastly, lack of assessment and data collection of completed training and programming can roadblock the process. As I mentioned above, Merrimack needs to improve its practices around collection and sharing of data related to diversity on campus. Assessment also appears to be an overlooked aspect of programming and education at higher education institutions across the board “The majority of training initiatives never move past the design phase, with no evaluation being carried out of their implementation and/or impact” (Moriña & Carballo, 2017). There was no pre- and post-assessment for the abovementioned Residence Life microagression training prepared until I mentioned it at the end of the planning process; an 30 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  example of how assessment is often lost in the process. However, the assessment served as evidence that has since spurred plans for future student leader and faculty and staff diversity training, a clear indication for the necessity. Indeed assessment is a key tool for understanding not only effectiveness, but also gauging self-awareness and engagement with topics (Stanley, 2010). As faculty and staff are coming into trainings with different levels of knowledge and self-awareness, being able to set a baseline pre-training can assist with formulating appropriate content. Making sure to collect data and assess post trainings can build support for further resource allocation towards additional trainings, can provide suggestions on how to adjust and change the trainings, and can make sure that voices are uplifted in the process- educating the trainers.    What Does Effective Diversity and Inclusion Training Look Like? What is a good indicator of a good diversity training strategy? The agents who control the process of establishing or facilitating diversity and inclusion training must intentionally consider many aspects including: (1) institutional type which includes: relation to institution’s mission, vision, values, and strategic plan as well as institutional needs, (2) learner, (3) goals and learning outcomes, (4) and content and delivery. As Cocchiarra et al. (2010) argue, “”Effective” diversity training looks different in each organization that initiates such programs and depends on several factors that vary greatly among firms” (p. 1094). In addition, “Effective diversity training is systematically embedded throughout the organization, customized for different work functions, and inclusive” (Cocchiarra, et al., 2010, p. 1096). Diversity training looks different at each institution that employs it, as each institution has a different community as well as a different leadership structure, however the limited available research indicates that there are reoccurring themes and methods that lead to effective diversity and inclusion training that can be implemented regardless of the institutional type. 31 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Understanding the Institution Trainings must consider the organizational culture as well as the institutional mission, vision, and values. Consideration of these factors are key in both creating buy-in from institutional executive leadership, who ultimately control resources and access, as well as the very group of learners, in this case faculty and staff, who the trainings are geared towards (Sinek, 2011). When there is buy-in from the top down, there will likely be resources allocated to support such training and leadership can gather participation (whether mandated or voluntary) (Bolman & Deal, 2017; Mohamad Karkouti, 2016). Buy-in can be developed by showing the benefits it has regarding recruitment and retention of minority students, faculty and staff if it is a tuition-dependent PWI (predominately white institution), showing how peer institutions have integrated it if the leadership culture focuses on competition, showing how the initiative engages with the mission if the organizational culture is mission-driven, or showing how it positively supports the bottom-line (e.g. hiring costs due to turnover from minority faculty and staff, lawsuits due to workplace or student space discrimination, or bad publicity due to publicized incidents) if the organizational culture of the institution has a business-focused structure (Cocchiarra et al., 2010: Mohamad Karkouti, 2016; Society for Human Resource Management, 2017). In addition, this opens doors for diversity and inclusion training to be included into the structure and processes of the institution, making it a priority.  If no diversity and inclusion training currently exists, looking at the institutional mission, vision, and values can be used as a means to argue for support and buy-in (Bolman & Deal, 2017). Scholars argue that individuals are more likely to transfer learned knowledge back into their workplace and their work if it aligns with their institutional goals (Cocchiarra et al., 2010; Cunningham, 2012). In addition, the knowledge transfer has an opportunity of being even stronger when training learning outcomes align with departmental/area mission, 32 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  vision, and values. If diversity is in the mission or vision statement, as it often is for higher education institutions, the development of diversity and inclusion trainings support and advance the mission and/or vision of the college, which should be a justifiable reason to ensure that such trainings exist and are adequately supported. Understanding the Learner Inclusivity at all levels must be considered when creating a sustainable campus community. Inclusion of individuals, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented or marginalized identities in the planning and implementation process is key to making this happen. “Successful diversity training widens the opportunity net to include groups who have historically been excluded and simultaneously ensures that groups who have historically been granted access do not perceive their opportunities as suddenly limited” (Coacchiarra et al., 2010, p. 1096). This means being very intentional during the planning process and bringing many different voices to the table to create a clear mission for the training, vision for learning outcomes, and trainings that adjust based on the population they mean to develop.  Full engagement of teams at all levels of an organization has the potential to bring real changes, both to workplace culture and to the company’s success. An individual from a minority group can speak to changes a specific company may need to take to encourage feelings of inclusion. Workers from different backgrounds can offer insights into how customers from similar backgrounds might experience a product or service the company is offering, thus potentially ensuring that companies appeal to a diverse range of customers (Aperian Global, 2017). These voices must include employees as part of the development process, as that integration is also part of the process of increasing and developing awareness around diversity and inclusion. “Organizations with effective strategies are often including employees in their discussions of diversity” (Aperian Global, 2017). These discussions of diversity start during 33 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  the planning process and extend through learning even after the training is complete, so considering the training developers as learners and ensuring a diversity of identities in this process is important for building towards authentic inclusivity.  This consideration as early as the training development process is important because as adults and practitioners in higher education we are dealing with decades of socialized and learned behaviors, biases, and stereotypes. Harro (2013) refers to this as the cycle of socialization: where individuals exist in a system of oppression and how they navigate their identities while socialized to participate in, maintain within, and then (hopefully) breakthrough the layers of oppression. When considering then how to best tailor educational trainings around diversity and inclusion, one must consider the learner and where they are in their learning journey. Each individual has baggage related to their identities, upbringings, current and past communities, and the society around them in which they must navigate (Harro, 2013). Trainings must understand and work to include the lived experiences of learners (Mezirow, 2000; Moriña & Carballo, 2017). Use of identity as part of the learning process may connect the learner to the information in a way that more generalized trainings may not. Consideration, therefore, of what the learner’s frame of reference and lived experience, as well as where learners are on the cycle of socialization can assist in framing discussions within workshops and trainings and can work towards building a community more aware of why diversity and inclusion is essential and where they fit within this. The selection of who is trained must also be carefully reviewed. The learner may be less likely to willingly engage with a training if they are not adequately informed as to why they were selected or if they feel that they were singled-out (Cocchiarra, Connerley, and Bell, 2010; Cunningham, 2012). Lawsuits could also result from a learner feeling that they were targeted unfairly or that the training negatively impacted them through its improper handling. In addition, the type of information presented is impacted by the learning style or educational 34 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  background of the learner (Cunningham, 2012). What you present to faculty may not be what you present to staff. How you present to Mathematics faculty may not be how you present to History faculty. One size fits all will not always work and trainings must strategically consider, as much as resources allow, the needs as well as identities of the learner and how the trainings fit into what they can bring into their daily work and lives. Goals and Learning Outcomes Having goals and learning outcomes establish and support the why one is doing training, how they may learn, and what information and learning they will hopefully retain (Cocchiara et al., 2010; Sinek, 2011). Due to the complexity of diversity and inclusion itself, it is important to have some goals and outcomes that shape the trainings. According to Samuels (2013), “some of the myriad goals for diversity trainings are to raise cultural awareness, to increase cultural sensitivity, and to build skills for increasing cultural inclusiveness, among others” (p 7). These trainings serve to increase staff and faculty awareness of the needs of others, self-awareness of own biases, and sensitivity to identities and lived experiences of others (Moriña & Carballo, 2017). This awareness and sensitivity can potentially decrease of incidents of bias and discrimination. In addition, leadership will be able to consider diversity and inclusion as part of their work and change the institutional and departmental policies, which is essential for creating inclusive environments (Bell et al., 2011; Moriña & Carballo, 2017). As more information and research is established around diversity and inclusion, the types of goals and learning outcomes should adjust and evolve accordingly, and should effectively indicate how these trainings will actually work towards positively impacting diversity and inclusion in the targeted community and organization. Goals and learning outcomes are important part of the diversity and inclusion training planning, implementation, and assessment process. 35 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Each organization and institution has different standards, goals, and outcomes expected of the diversity training based on the needs of the learners. This can make it difficult to determine best practices for Merrimack College, as what can be effective for a nearby similarly sized and structured college, may not work, as one size does not fit all. However, having goals and predetermined pre- and post-assessment is key to helping determine if the outcomes met expectations, if the correct training was utilized for the learner, and what was effective or not (Cocchiarra et al., 2010). Is the new or improved knowledge being utilized in the workspace? Creating sessions/trainings/workshops that provide skills that are transferable to what the learner does in their particular work is more likely to improve learning outcomes and willingness to apply learning in the workplace (Stanley, 2010). This intentionality in planning can assist in establishing a successful, effective, and relevant diversity and inclusion training that supports the needs of Merrimack College. Content and Delivery The creation and implementation of effective diversity and inclusion trainings must consider factors such as how far in advance were the trainings planned, why the trainings were established, what information is focused on, who handles the trainings, what measures were considered when implementing, and what additional and complementary support and initiatives are available. Strategic timing of trainings, for example, is essential to engage employees at periods that work best for their schedules. It would not be sensible to require or suggest Admission staff to engage in inclusion training during November, a month that is a heavy work period, where working over 40 hours a week is a norm, as staff wade through the thick of application review for prospective students. The first few weeks at the start of academic semesters would also not be opportune times to have faculty at trainings with the expectation for them to even be fully engaged if they do attend. Determining periods of time 36 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  that faculty and staff may have lighter workloads, during the summer for instance, could benefit attendance and participant attentiveness. In addition to timing, ownership is important to the initiative’s feasibility. Understanding which office or area owns diversity and inclusion training is important to securing necessary resources, development of buy-in from various sources, and sustaining the trainings for long-term success (Smith & Weidman Powers, 2016). For trainings focused on faculty and staff it will often fall under human resources, a faculty teaching development institute, or under a Diversity Department. Whichever area(s) the trainings fall under could cause limitations or roadblocks around development and sustainability of the training, or can serve as a benefit if the related office or department has clout amongst leadership, can devote necessary resources, or has educated staff able to effectively coordinate.  Whatever office oversees the trainings, particularly if they are mandated trainings, should consider a proper strategy regarding proactive or reactive implementation. A proactive strategy does not initiate trainings as a result of an incident or force them due to compliance needs, but instead is proactively integrated into faculty and staff ongoing professional development. This proactive approach is more likely to motivate individuals to engage with topics of diversity, social justice, equity, and inclusion, as more reactive trainings may make individuals feel targeted (Cunningham, 2012; Dobbin & Kalev, 2016; Moriña & Carballo, 2017). Mandatory trainings can create antagonism against the very marginalized groups the trainings hoped to support or could further decrease diversity in the workforce (Dobbin & Kalev; 2016). Forced, reactive trainings also may demotivate employees to retain what is being taught and return that new knowledge to the workplace, a key point in professional development and training. As Cunningham (2012) argues, when “the motivation is externally situated, and the direct links from diversity training and organizational effectiveness might not be evident; as such, employees’ enthusiasm toward transferring the knowledge, skills, and 37 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  attitudes to the work environment is likely to be low” (p. 394). Indeed, intentionally mandated trainings that are instituted to “handle” a problem or as a result of legal matters are less likely to engender true learning and absorption, effectively harming efforts to improve diversity issues on campus. Instead, mandated diversity and inclusion trainings, which evidence supports the need of, must be proactive in order to be effective (Moriña & Carballo, 2017). They should intentionally be integrated into the policies and practices of the institution so that faculty and staff know that this is an institutional priority not a one-off.  In addition to strategic implementation, diversity and inclusion trainings must also be strategically crafted to build a knowledge core around concepts, and then continued through maintenance and improvement of the basics towards a competency and ability to sufficiently act through a lens of social justice and inclusivity. Appreciating the complex and often triggering topics and concepts, scholars suggest introducing training with more generalized information, including concepts on social justice, diversity, and inclusion, as well as creating a foundation for understanding of terminology and different identities (Cocchiarra, Connerley, and Bell, 2010; Ouellett, 2010; Stanley, 2010). Once a baseline of knowledge is established, trainings should continue to increase in difficulty and breadth, allowing for specificity based on individual learner or workforce type needs. Knowledge creation all should have the stories of individuals, particularly marginalized identities, at the forefront. Let them tell their own stories. Participation in such trainings, which have individuals one may not generally interact with tell their stories and explain the barriers they face on a campus, have benefited learners- increasing empathy and ability to orient their perceptions outside of their own (Moriña & Carballo, 2017).Trainings must be sustained and engrained in structure of organization in order to ensure continuous improvement and limited stagnation of understanding for learner. Lastly, communication is key to ensuring effective diversity and inclusion training. Leadership must be communicated with regarding how the proposed or implemented trainings 38 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  will support the mission and goals of the institution in order to develop and sustain support from them (Society for Human Resource Development, 2017). The training needs to be marketed to all of the campus, showing even to those who are not the direct audience, that diversity and inclusion is important to the institution and being invested in. For any assessment taken, the results must be analyzed and disseminated transparently to the campus community. In addition, communication is key between the facilitators and the participants during the training, as the facilitators should strive to maintain awareness of how the information is or is not being internalized, being able to flexibly change the workshop format or content if such a change is needed to make the diversity and inclusion training authentically inclusive to participants. Community Building. A means to be authentically inclusive is through the establishment and maintenance of a communal learning space. This authenticity can adversely be impacted by the space in which participants learn and the existence of a lack community standards that develop an inclusive space through social justice. “Community standards are shared agreements that define mutual expectations for how the community will function on an interpersonal level, that is, how the members will relate to and treat one another” (Piper, 1997, p. 22). I consider community standards, for the purposes of this capstone, as the creation of a learning environment where learners are active, not passive and take responsibility for engaging with the curriculum and challenging themselves and others to hear all voices, but raise up traditionally underrepresented and marginalized voices to the forefront. These community standards create a space that is purposefully not safe. Instead, they work to subvert the dominant narrative: the discourse that is controlled by those individuals and institutions in positions of power and privilege (Cole, 2018). This will assist in helping the facilitators and participants in creating an authentically equitable and inclusive brave learning space. 39 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  While having community standards and creating a “safe space” are often seen as important to effective diversity training, I believe the latter can potentially adversely impact the effectiveness of the trainings, particularly for those with underprivileged or oppressed identities. Many diversity training consultants and researchers refer to the making of a safe space as an important part of diversity training (Cocchiarra et al., 2010). However, I challenge that individuals cannot truly grow through comfort and safety and that individuals in oppressed or minority groups cannot be given the same opportunity for a safe space as the dominant (which in America is white, straight, cisgender, Christian, able-bodies individuals- particularly men). Arao and Clemens (2013) eloquently argue that the target group (those who do not hold primarily dominant identities) will never truly feel safe in conversations or setting with the agent group (those with dominant and privileged identities). The target group faces exposing their identities or having to make the agent group comfortable with new knowledge of identities or experiences they do not have access to; creating a dynamic where the target group must teach and therefore be burdened with educating others, creating an unsafe space for them. Particularly, these safe spaces embody white privilege (Arao & Clemens, 2013), as those in the oppressed group may be forced to relive negative experiences, take in negative and harmful perceptions and stereotypes, or exist in spaces where the agent group has to now grapple with concepts that individuals in the target group live with as daily facts of life (i.e. racism, classism, sexism, and microagressions). Instead, Arao and Clemens (2013) argue instead for a “brave space” when creating these learning settings that involve diversity, inclusion, and social justice. This brave space would push dialogue to not rely on the voices and experiences of those found in the oppressed or less/non-privileged groups, but instead on the courage of all, particularly the privileged voices to dive into topics that they may otherwise think they do not have direct relevance to. I would argue that this type of space still embodies white privilege, as this bravery and courage 40 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  still forces those in the target group to exist in a space where their identities already require bravery and where their experiences are often used to teach others in the dominant group to better engage with the “other”. Instead of relying on safe or brave spaces, community standards that promote a shared space of learning and dialogue may provide a better avenue for those in the agent group to engage with the target group in relation to diversity training. Community standards are important to the formation of guiding expectations for discourse and dialogue that can create a deeper learning environment necessary for effective training. Diversity Training Models My proposed diversity and inclusion curriculum is based off of models found in researching diversity training for faculty and staff. Many versions provide research-based multiday seminar “Institute” formats for faculty (Booker, Merriweather & Campbell-Whatley, 2016; Ellis & Ortquist-Ahrens, 2010; Maxwell & Gurin, 2017; Ukpokodu, 2010). Examples of seminars and workshops focused on best practices for diverse and inclusive curriculum and syllabi, inclusive classroom dynamics, development of awareness regarding self and other identities, or engagement with privilege (Booker et al., 2016; Maxwell & Gurin, 2017; Samuels, 2013). All examples included formats of 60-90 minute workshops focusing on different topics to meet learning goals, many of which I have also integrated into my own seminar structure. These types of seminars had various outcomes, but the general theme was development of attendees to be more engaged with diversity, more culturally competent, and able to create more inclusive learning, living, and working spaces on campuses.  Given the complexity, breadth, and depth of possible topics covered in diversity and inclusion training, I will highlight important areas that I find essential, and noticed as reoccurring themes, in training faculty and staff.  In particular, diversity and inclusion training often cover topics around race and gender (Samuels, 2013), but there are many other identities that must be considered to make 41 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  these trainings authentically diverse and inclusive. Racial bias is a common focus as one form of training, and microagression and unconscious bias are two main training areas that cover this issue. As Bauman (2018) notes, “the most commonly reported hate crimes in 2016, as in each of the previous four years, were offenses associated with racial bias. They accounted for 40 percent of all hate crimes reported by colleges”. In addition, “many companies are also offering unconscious bias training, which is important given how deep-rooted bias can be. While managers and workers may believe that they are unbiased, they may have unspoken beliefs that can permeate a workplace” (Aperian Global, 2017). These are definitely important areas to cover, but diversity and inclusion trainings should expand to cover more identities. Gender, like race, is the other commonly focused on identity in trainings, one that we often seen paired with sexuality. LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, questioning/queer, intersex, asexual) is an initialism with an ever-growing list of sexuality and gender-based identities that shows this very well. These two identities often intersect, but should not be considered or engaged with in the same manner. Nicolazzo (2017) articulates this as: “the conflation of sexuality and gender by those on and off college campuses not only is highly reductive but also threatens to overlook the distinct experiences of trans* students” (p.36). Yet, with limited resources and educational knowledge on these subjects, universities have utilized trainings that combine both (i.e. Safe Zone) to a least have the conversation start and be at least one example of a campus’ intention to be welcoming to LGBT identities (Finkel, Storaasli, Bandele & Schaefer, 2003).  Other identities covered in diversity training include age, socioeconomic status, religion, and ability. The trend around diversity training appears to be increasingly inclusive of these identities, with many trainings focusing on the commonality found between them (including race and gender) (Bezrukova et al., 2012). It was difficult to locate recent research and data on these types of trainings, but they definitely exist to a lesser extent within the realm 42 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  of diversity and inclusion training and education (Crawford, 2004; Hage, Hopson, Siegel, Payton & DeFanti, 2011; Jones, King, Nelson, Geller & Bowes-Sperry, 2013). All of these trainings are essential to creating an inclusive learning, living, and working environment. However, these area are often excluded in higher education diversity training and education, to the detriment of classroom dynamics, resource allocation and consideration, and policies and strategies in support of the related populations (Crawford, 2004; Moriña & Carballo, 2017; Rood & Damiani, 2015). Such areas can hopefully be incorporated into the training curriculum at Merrimack College that moves beyond the oft-use racial and sexuality focused trainings. In addition, faculty learned how to better manage a classroom (i.e. how to respond or better engage with students who have disabilities, religious needs, and financial inhibitions) and were more adaptable to the needs of students (Bell et al., 2009; Cocchiara et al., 2010). These measures are all important to building an inclusive classroom in an area often absent in the discussion of diversity and inclusion. Clearly there is a need for diversity and inclusion training at Merrimack College and race and gender cannot be the only areas of identity covered.  Theoretical Framework I have chosen Feminist Standpoint Theory (Collins, 1997) and Transformational Learning Theory (Mezirow, 2000) as the theoretical frameworks which guide the construction of this curriculum, the intentionality how these workshops are framed and structured, the learning outcomes developed, as well as grounding in which I researched the various topics. These two theories exist amongst a multitude of relevant theoretical bases. However for my purposes, Feminist Standpoint Theory and Transformational Learning Theory provide the grounding needed to establish this foundational work and expand it further to create a deep, intentional, authentic, radical, and transformational diversity and inclusion training curriculum for faculty and staff at Merrimack College. 43 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Patricia Hill Collin’s interpretation of Feminist Standpoint Theory situates learning as the catalyst for understanding and therefore being able to change the systems in place that socialize the isms (racism, sexism, classism, etc.) and cement dynamics of power based on oppression of others (Collins, 1997). A key aspect of this theory that I find pertinent in relation to the diversity and inclusion training is that it focuses on the group instead of the individual. In learning and thus being able to effect change, one must look past the individual injustices or even these experiences within communities or groups, but instead analyze the social conditions that impact and form the experiences and realities of groups, marginalized and not (Collins, 1997). In particular, this theory relates this analysis of group experience to their existence within power. This is particularly important as the dominant discourse, those in power, can even frame how diversity and inclusion is conceptualized and thus taught. I aim to use this theory to work to dismantle the power of the dominant discourse and uplift the voices and experiences of the marginalized.  Mezirow’s Transformational Learning theory offers another method within which the proposed diversity and inclusion trainings can be based. His theory focuses particular on the adult learner where the deconstructing of learned behavior, prejudices, biases, and assumptions are changed through the learning of historical, cultural, social, and personal stories and related histories (Mezirow, 2000). From this, learners form new understandings and transform how they understand and thus interact with others. Part of the objective of transformational learning is awareness in two particular ways: awareness of self within the dominating culture/power structure and awareness of historical structures that create systematic power and how that has impacted the social context within that society (Mezirow, 2000; Imel, 1998). Transformational learning when incorporated into diversity and inclusion training also provides opportunities for individuals to gain understanding of identities outside 44 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  of their own and create communities based on shared histories, interests, needs, and beliefs; which is necessary for understanding the intersectionality within diversity and inclusion. Transformational learning cannot occur without a need for safe space (Mezirow, 2000). However, I challenge this notion and use Mezirow’s theoretical framework as a means to instead note that a space for dialogue and challenge (which can inherently be unsafe) is needed that is not safe, but liberatory and brave. In addition, it requires an instructor willing to help learners adjust and push through challenges to their current knowledge and views. Dependent on the structure of a workshop it can be important to have a facilitator or instructor available and trained to guide learners through their questions, challenge their assumptions, and provide the tools for the learner to dive deeper into topics outside of the learning space. However, I also use Feminist Standpoint Theory to argue that an instructor can create an unequal learning setting (Collins, 1997), and that in order to work towards a transformational learning experience, any workshop instructor or facilitator must instead endeavor to create a learning space where they are equal and their voice is not more prominent to others in the space1. Both Feminist Standpoint Theory and Transformational Learning Theory provide avenues of learning essential for being able to self-identify one’s privilege or lack thereof- dependent on context, and what that means as an employee, leader, mentor, supervisor, and member of a community like Merrimack College (Collins, 1997; Mezirow, 2000). However, in order to understand one’s personal existence within society, they must first understand the societal social structures in place that effect these identities, groups, and larger communities. Thus both these theories help to create a learning strategy that transforms the learning of diversity and inclusion to outside of just the personal experiences, but further to examining,                                                   1 I consider the idea, as suggested by Professor Elaine Ward, of Native American Talking Circles as a possible example of this learning setting. 45 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  understanding, and therefore being able to change the institutional and cultural/societal structures and powers that create and sustain oppression and marginalization.  Project Summary My goal for this diversity and inclusion training curriculum is to transform the knowledgebase of learners towards (1) an understanding of their place, through their identities, in society, (2) comprehension of the structures and realities at the personal, institutional, and cultural levels that create and sustain oppression (i.e. The Cycle of Socialization), (3) and awareness of means to creating true inclusivity by dismantling the dominant discourse that sustains privileges, oppression, and marginalization. To fulfill these goals I have developed the following learning outcomes: 1. Understanding of terminology around diversity, inclusion, social justice, intersectionality, and equity and their context within higher education.  2. Identification of bias and discriminatory behaviors. 3. Identification of systematic measure of oppression (policies and practices) and how they impact work in office and classroom, as well as interaction with campus body. 4. Ability to confront interactions and behaviors that create divisive, discriminatory, and oppressive situations and environments; while dismantling the dominant discourse. These learning outcomes will serve to orient the four-day seminar series. I have devised a foundational curriculum based on these learning outcomes that endeavors to provide education and professional development around various topics related to diversity and inclusion for faculty and staff at Merrimack College. The curriculum’s intention is the establishment of a diversity and inclusion seminar that is not “diversity-light”, as Merrimack tends to lean towards based on my experiences and conversations with faculty and staff, but authentically engaging. 46 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Method of Delivery For the purposes of this capstone, I determined that a multiday summer diversity and inclusion seminar would be the best mode of delivery. During the research process, this was a common delivery method for faculty, with some institutions providing a three-day delivery and some institutions providing week-long trainings (Booker et al., 2016; Ellis & Ortquist-Ahrens, 2010; Maxwell & Gurin, 2017). This type of programming “can provide the time required to engage more deeply with a complex topic…”, like diversity and inclusion (Ellis & Ortquist-Ahrens, 2010, p. 119). My seminar would also include administrators and staff, given that many do interact with students as instructors through First Year Experience or often have direct contact with students on a daily basis. Administrators and staff are often the first point of contact for both prospective and current students at Merrimack, so it is important that they are included in this training as well.  To deliver this seminar there will be a webpage built for the trainings that will provide attendees, members of the campus, and interested community and external parties access to resources related to diversity initiatives on campus, a layout of the event, a more detailed schedule on the day of the event and afterwards, and additional information on other resources as determined from the seminars. The webpage provides a centralized learning center for further diversity and inclusion materials, programming, and future trainings that will showcase Merrimack’s continued investment in diversity and inclusion. To assist with participation, I intend to incentivize through “tokens of appreciation” by having refreshments and meals provided during the sessions and giving out swag (tote bags and books). This has been shown to increase buy-in of participants and their willingness to promote the program through a sense of obligation in return for these “gifts” (Neal & Peed-Neal, 2010). Also, the selected topics and areas of exploration are topical and directly relevant to the work of the faculty and staff who will participate. 47 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Curriculum Vision and Content The presented curriculum for diversity and inclusion training is meant to serve as a foundation for the development of a comprehensive program. As such, I intentionally focused on certain topics in building out lesson plans and materials as a means to purposefully craft curriculum for a very important and complex subject matter, instead of presenting haphazard and shallow activities and workshops. Indeed the development of diversity and inclusion content for faculty and staff is best approached through collaboration with community members engaged with and educated on these areas (Ouellett, 2010; Stanley, 2010). This collaboration is also important because it brings a diversity of experiences, voices, and identities to the table which is important if the goal is to subvert the dominant discourse and be authentically diverse and inclusive. The format for my diversity and inclusion training is a four-day seminar titled: Diversity and Inclusion Seminar. The first day focuses on topics under areas of: Understanding Diversity and Inclusion as Educators, Intersectionality of Oppression, Advancing the Discourse, and Inclusive Policies and Actions. The intention is to start with foundational information, building on vocabulary and concepts, then moving through the series to culminate with a day focused on action steps that put this learned knowledge into practice. Participants will be coming from different places of knowledge and experiences, so the seminar series functions as a means to bring individuals to a foundation to build upon and be able to then engage with further education and progressive action on Merrimack’s campus.  Participants While the ideal situation for this diversity and inclusion training at Merrimack would include all faculty (including part-time/adjunct) and staff, realistically resources are limited, and scheduling an event all would be able (and willing) to attend would likely create a logistical nightmare. Instead, I am suggesting a seminar that targets 84 faculty and staff 48 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  members that represent as many academic colleges and as many administrative areas as possible. This allows for more in-depth and focused training, smaller group learning, and a better use of resources and time. In addition, this creates a more targeted approach for outreach, where instead of creating an event too large and convoluted, can instead focus on learners and be a better use of tight resources (space, time, and money) (Neal & Peed-Neel, 2010). The number 84 also makes splitting groups for group work and learning easier, making groups equal numerically if possible. The determination of participants in this manner also creates the opportunity to make the seminar series annual, to ensure that all faculty and staff have access to the training series. Based on other models, this also leaves opportunities for changing workshops topics as necessary, while maintaining a core set (Booker et al., 2016). In addition, the smaller size assists in the assessment process where small-group interviews can be used as a means to gauge how beneficial the seminar series was, suggestions for future programming or changes to the format, and how the seminar has impacted the current work of participants.  The 84 participants will be placed within seven groups that are named for a particular identity: Ability, Sexuality, Class, Age, Race, Religion, and Gender. These particular identities were chosen due to the robust amount of data and research around both oppression and support of these groups (noting that some topics have less intersectionality-based information) (Bezrukova et al., 2012; Nicolazzo, 2017), and best-practices around training and education. In addition, these identities are most pertinent to our student, faculty, and staff population given demographics, our religious affiliation, and research supporting the need to support these identities at higher education institutions, as noted above; as discrimination increases nationwide and incidents continue to occur on campus.  49 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Philosophy of Teaching My teaching philosophy is guided by movement away from the dominant discourse in every aspect of how I situate this curriculum; from how I choose the room, to who gets to speak, to what topics are covered, to who is at the planning table. In order to do this I want to use theoretical grounding with pedagogical frameworks to guide this work. Therefore, I determined Collin’s Feminist Standpoint Theory and Mezirow’s Transformational Learning as my theoretical frameworks in collaboration with intergroup dialogue and diversity management competency as my pedagogical strategies (Avery & Thomas, 2004; Collins, 1997; Maxwell & Gurin, 2017; Mezirow, 2000). This collaboration will help to ensure often marginalized voices are heard and that individuals from privileged identities are challenged to move outside of personal narratives and biases to build knowledge and understanding through shared experiences.  To move from the dominant discourse, I center one’s identities as the lens in which work, interactions, and navigation of society should be framed so that through this the privileged voice is decentralized and marginalized voices are raised up. In reflection of my values, beliefs, experiences, and my own identities I determined diversity management competency and intergroup dialogue as best strategies to convey this and orient how and why I educate. Diversity management competency is a framework that can be used to bridge learning and comprehension of diversity (Avery & Thomas, 2004). This competency framework notes student’s awareness of own perspectives and identities, the perspectives and identities of others, and how this greater understanding of the diversity of individuals assists in the creation of a more inclusive work space and workplace (Avery & Thomas, 2004). It offers modules under which diversity related curriculum should be developed and areas these curricula should encompass (including multidimensionality and intersectionality) in order to build a solid competency in diversity and inclusion. In addition, it offers foundations and 50 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  methods upon which faculty and staff can develop classroom dynamics, curriculum, and coursework that widens awareness, understanding, and comprehension of diversity and inclusion (Avery & Thomas, 2004). This framework highlights one of my teaching principles in which identity, both personal and other, is centered as the lens through which we learn and teach. Another teaching principle also relates to identity, but ensures that multiple voices and identities are used in the teaching and learning process. Intergroup dialogue provides a space in which individuals from at least two social identity groups dialogue, “engage in deep listening, ask questions with the goal of understanding multiple perspectives, draw on both course content and others’ identity-based experiences to deepen learning, and reflect collectively on the knowledge that has been shared and created” (Maxwell & Gurin, 2017). Using intergroup dialogue to facilitate discourse through this lens is important in order to bring marginalized voices to the front and allow them space in a learning space where individuals from privileged identities often take center stage. This challenges the power structure in the learning space and challenges privileges identities to learn from marginalized identities (Maxwell & Gurin, 2017). This is an important part of learning and transforming one’s knowledgebase that I consider essential in the education process. Such learning is important within diversity and inclusion training to develop empathy, greater understanding outside of the self, and also gain knowledge of the intersectionality of identities. Intersectionality provides a tool in which to analyze how one’s identities intersect, coexist (or fail to do so), and how these identities exist within communities that include or exclude them. Intersectionality also exists as a means to try to understand how identity navigates the structures in place at the institutional, societal, and personal levels that are driven through oppression and inequality (Dill & Zambrana, 2009). Intersectionality is important to my work as an educator and is the third principle in which I center my work.  51 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  My aim as an educator in diversity and inclusion education is to create a learning space where the marginalized voice is uplifted and centered; creating a space where all identities can be presented and included. To do this I endeavor to center one’s identities in these spaces, using intersectionality to frame how these identities interact and therefore exist in American society. I aim to transform all learners through consideration of experiences, histories, viewpoints, and identities of and outside of their own in relation to dominant discourse, as established through the institutional and cultural conditions that create and sustain discrimination and oppression. I aim therefore to develop individuals able to confront these realities and be active in dismantling the dominant discourse, building an authentically diverse and inclusive community around them. Next Steps The length of my capstone speaks directly to the complexity of the concepts and realities of diversity and inclusion. They are areas where research both abounds and remains sparse. The provided research and analysis provides context for why diversity and inclusion training is important to Merrimack College, as well as theoretical frameworks of Feminist Standpoint and Transformational Learning in which to position it. Undoubtedly there are many benefits and reasons to establish diversity and inclusion training at Merrimack College. Whether it is improved cultural awareness and competency, improved support for students, staff, and faculty, or meeting the institutional mission and financial needs; diversity and inclusion training can better the institution and help develop a sustainable campus climate and community that will support its long term success. This capstone provides context within which Merrimack College leadership can create successful integrations of diversity and inclusion training among staff and faculty leadership; increasing input and co-participation of all levels of administration/faculty to build more structured diverse and inclusive trainings, policies, and institutional culture.    52 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  The complexity that is diversity and inclusion is therefore best handled through collaboration with faculty and administrators from Merrimack College in a space that allows for a cooperative establishment of programming and content for a more robust and inclusive training curriculum. Indeed, these various voices will bring a diverse set of educational and work experiences, improve the representation of different identities in the planning process, and be a better use of resources. These individuals will serve to create a louder voice for the need amongst their peers and the administration, helping to move the needle much further than I could solely.   Indeed, diversity and inclusion training is only as effective as the leadership’s willingness to integrate it as part of the institution (Bell et al., 2011). Diversity and inclusion training must be woven into the fabric of Merrimack’s policies and practices, and thus properly invested in. Merrimack needs to invest the necessary resources towards diversity and inclusion training. Faculty and staff who wish to engage deeper with topics around diversity note the necessity of their institutions providing the tools for them to be able to do so (Bell et al., 2011; Moriña & Carballo, 2017). These tools including training and continued development, policies that reward not penalize tenure track faculty who engage in such work (especially if it does not strictly align with discipline or research), institutional policies that promote diversity and inclusion, and buy-in from leadership. In addition, these trainings cannot exist apart from other diversity and inclusion initiatives if Merrimack intends it to be successful and sustainable. Leadership must work to remove the challenges that currently exist around implementation and integration of diversity and inclusion initiatives. Bolman & Deal (2017) correctly ague that “training can go only so far in ensuring semi-flawless individual performance” (p. 29). These diversity and inclusion trainings must be made an integral institution at Merrimack by pairing trainings with other diversity-related initiatives and events. Studies indicate that diversity training cannot be stand 53 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  alone, a one-time event, or reactive to bias incidents or its impact will be negated or negatively reinforce an exclusive campus environment where diversity and inclusion are not priorities (Bezrukova, Spell, Perry, & Jehn, 2016; Ukpokodu, 2010). Therefore, to support these trainings, Merrimack also needs to provide resources that assists individuals who want to better engage in promoting diversity or who have dealt with bias and discriminatory incidents. Some such resources could be inclusive hiring and admission policies, a confidential incident reporting system, town hall meetings, professional affinity and support groups, networking and mentoring, and more inclusive policies within faculty and administration handbooks. These resources can act as an additional bridge for support, awareness building, and further creation of more specific diversity training and education as interest and needs arise (Bell et al., 2011; Mohamad Karkouti, 2016). Merrimack College must take the opportunity to authentically engage with diversity and inclusion; creating a more diverse and inclusive campus community that prioritizes supporting proactive change at Merrimack. This calls for filling the gap and building an institution where faculty and staff are adequately trained and provided with sufficient opportunities to engage in diversity and inclusion training and initiatives, for the betterment and long-term sustainability of this institution. 54 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  References Adam, M., & Zúῆiga, X.

In order to be authentically diverse and inclusive, it would be hypocritical for my voice to be solely present throughout this curriculum. As such, I have established a foundation with the intention of bringing in the voices, identities, and expertise of faculty, staff, and students at Merrimack to establish the full training curriculum and related activities. Attendees: Faculty and Staff at Merrimack College (expected attendance: 84) Suggested Readings: Reading List sent to faculty and staff two months prior to training Please bring:  Notebook, Writing Utensil, Electronic Device (for those needing learning accessible tools) Mission: The purpose of this seminar is to provide a series of workshops that inform learners about concepts around diversity and inclusion, provide an overview of the history of higher education in relation to diversity and inclusion, challenge perceptions of self-identity and how we perceive social identity, and orient learners to view identities through the intersectionality of experiences and the socialization from the society we exist in. This seminar provides an interdisciplinary perspective of diversity and inclusion, while utilizing Feminist Standpoint and Transformational Learning theories to guide learning methodologies and strategies. Learning Outcomes:  Understanding of terminology around diversity, inclusion, social justice, intersectionality, and equity and their context within higher education.  Awareness of personal identity, the spectrum of identities, and how identity is impacted by socialization through intersectionality. Logistics Reservation of spaces to be completed 4-6 months in advance.   63 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  8:30 – 9:00 Arrival Learners are asked to arrive by 8:30 Continental Breakfast   Crowe Executive Room 9:00 – 9:15 Introduction Why is Diversity and Inclusion Training Necessary A powerpoint and talk about benefit, the necessity in relation to Merrimack College, and select data.

Each group has an identity that they will further explore during lunch, as part of knowledge building. In each workshop, learners will pay particular attention to their group’s identity in each learning space. [Groups will have been pre-selected based on answers to questions on registration form.] Group A: Ability Group B: Sexuality Group C: Class Group D: Age Group E: Race Group F: Religion  Group G: Gender  Groups will move to their separate locations to being diversity and inclusion workshops. I chose these particular identities due to the robust amount of data and research around both oppression and support of these groups (admitting that some topics have less intersectionality-based information), and best-practices around training and education. In addition, these identities are most pertinent to our student, faculty, and staff population.    Crowe Executive Room 10:00 -10:15 Self-assessment on D&I Knowledge Base as Educators (A1) Participants will complete a survey assessing personal understanding and awareness of topics pertaining to and within diversity and inclusion.

This session will engage with the topics of dialogue and discourse, with the intention of transforming how we converse and communicateiii. Given that the following topics are challenging, having a particular means in which we engage in these topics can assist us in creating those brave spaces. Given that we operate in society through the dominant discourse, this session will challenge individuals to consider the discourse of the marginalized as they go through the day’s workshops. In this same vein, the goal of learners will be to not seek answers or conclusions to presented problems or topics, but instead to learn and build knowledge through the sharing of perspectives, via dialogue (10 minute overview).  Techniques: Learners will be separated into groups of 5 to practices dialoguing through case study related to identity, with intention to move learners to dialoguing in response to issue presented.

Intersectionality provides a tool in which to analyze how one’s identities intersect, coexist (or fail to do so), and how these identities exist within communities that include or exclude them. Intersectionality also exists as a means to try to understand how identity navigates the structures in place at the institutional, societal, and personal levels that are driven through oppression and inequalityvi.

You ask for initial responses to the reading and the majority of student in your predominately white classroom think it could be a great opportunity due to abuses in the pharmaceutical industry and over prescribing of opioids by medical professionals. A smaller group debate the merits of it as pertaining to a larger economic context. However, you notice that in particular the two black students in the class remain silent. The only visibly physically handicapped student, a white female has commented on being skeptical of such research, which has led to the louder voices from the majority pressing her for her reasons. The class has dissolved into a debate, with some voices missing from the conversation.  Questions (20 minutes in small groups, 10 minutes in large group):  1. What do you immediately notice in this scenario (write on board)? 2. How do you change this class dynamic?  3. What is the dominate discourse? What is the marginalized discourse? 4. How can the conversation move to dialogue and be more inclusive of discourse? [Facilitator notes: The black students may be reticent to add to the discussion being minorities in the class and having dissenting opinions from the majority. These dissenting opinions may have evolved from the realities of how the healthcare system has harmed and oppressed African American individuals historically (i.e. Tuskegee syphilis research, the racist history of Mental Facilities). The handicapped student may also harbor like views due to the historical mistreatment of handicapped individuals in the name of scientific gain, but may feel more willing to voice their opinion as they are within the racial majority of the classroom.]     78 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  A3: Terms and Definitions Pairing Exercise (20 minutes) Exercise: Facilitator will post terms around the room (with tape).

Answer: 47% “Other retirees are forced out of their jobs due to changes at their company, such as a downsizing or closure (18 percent), changes in the skills required for their job (7 percent) or other work-related reasons (22 percent)”viii. 2. Answer: Women. “…women are a fast growing demographic of the prison population. There are currently 219,000 women — mostly mothers — behind bars in our nation’s overlapping criminal justice systems”ix. 3. Answer: 48%“Hunger on Campus found that 48 percent of students faced food insecurity in the previous month, with 22 percent reporting “very low levels of food security that qualify them as hungry.” And “According to Hunger on Campus, 50 percent of community college students and 47 percent of four-year college students reported food insecurity. Twenty-five percent and 20 percent (respectively) had very low food security. At community colleges, “13 percent of all respondents (regardless of food insecurity) experienced homelessness, compared to 7 percent at four-year schools.”x 4. Answer: 20% 4x higher, “While respondents in the USTS sample overall were more than twice as likely as the U.S. population to be living in poverty, people of color, including Latino/a (43%), American Indian (41%), multiracial (40%), and Black (38%) respondents, were more than three times as likely as the U.S. population (12%) to be living in poverty”xi. 5. Answer: 1 in 37xii. 6. Answer: 1300. In 2016, 1300 hate crimes (defined by the federal government as “acts of physical harm and specific criminal threats motivated by animus based on race, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability”) were reported on college campuses across the nationxiii. This number has being on a steady upward trajectory, with the past five years averaging around 995 reported incidents. 7. Answer: 68% a. More than half (60%) of respondents who were out to their immediate family reported that their family was supportive of them as a transgender person. More than two-thirds (68%) of those who were out to their coworkers reported that their coworkers were supportive. Of students who were out to their classmates, more than half (56%) reported that their classmates supported them as a transgender personxiv. 8. Answer: 1/3 “More than a third of those aged 18 to 33 are religiously unaffiliated, and that proportion is even greater for the younger half of that cohort”xv. 9. Answer: 11xvi  10. Answer: trick question. Current lack of research and data means that we do not have a clear answer regarding demographic makeup of faculty in higher education in regards to sexuality. However, studies suggest that there is a higher proportion of faculty who identify as LGB in higher education that other fieldsxvii. Individuals are more likely to pass or cover their sexual identities for a variety of reasons. Also, unlike race and gender, sexuality is not tracked by the federal government regarding employment and representation, which can make it difficult to truly gauge data around discriminationxviii.     81 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  A5: Social Identity Profile and Identity Wheel (45 minutes) Learners will individually complete a sheet that includes a table listing personal social identity memberships (areas include ethnicity, race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, etc.) and then fill in an identity wheel that shows personal understanding of how their identities fit within their lives and consciousnessxix. Learners will then share in groups of 3 their profile and pie, what this means in the context of their work as educators and practitioners, what this means in the context of Merrimack, discuss commonalities, what they noticed or learned from others in group. Large group reflection and discussion.  A6: Exploring Socialization through Storytelling (45 minutes) Learners will watch video: Hiding in Plain Sight (https://www.thisamericanlife.org/469/hiding-in-plain-sight). Large group discussion.

Slide 5 What is ….?1. LGBTQ2. Lesbian3. Gay4. Bisexual5. Transgender6. Queer One way to do this: is to ask them to identify the words first and then move on to our definitions   84 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  Slide 6 Definitions• LGBTQ+• acronym for “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, & queer”• Lesbian• A woman who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to other female identifying people• Gay• A person who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to members of the same gender.

Being transgender does not imply any specific sexual orientation. Therefore, transgender people may identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc.• Queer• A term people often use to express fluid identities and orientations. Often used interchangeably with \"LGBTQ.\" Queer is a word that has been used negatively but has been reclaimed by some LGBT individuals to describe their gender identity and/or sexual orientation  Slide 8 Definitions• Cisgender• A term used to describe a person whose gender identity aligns with those typically associated with the sex assigned to them at birth• Heterosexual• Clinical term describing a person whose sexual orientation is directed towards members of the opposite sex facilitators cover that everyone has a gender and a sexuality  understanding that these are what is considered “the norm” which leads into coming out   Slide 9 Definitions• Gender Identity• One’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves.

But what do you have down there?  Are you a boy or a girl? You don't look like a girl, etc.  Have you had the surgery?  You don't look like a Betty/Javier/Cris/__________. What is your real name?

While there are earlier examples, one of the most famoust is the Atlanta Braves, a baseball team that added Braves to their name in 1910. Its not difficult to go to a game of one of these teams and hear “war-chants”, red face paint, and other demeaning behaviors.              Dr. Pierce coined the term in 1970, describing it as “subtle, stunning, often automatic, and non-verbal exchanges which are “put downs””. From there the research and widespread acknowledgement of these types of interactions has grown.  Among many other findings, President Clinton’s Race Advisory Board in 1998 concluded that “racial inequities are so deeply ingrained in American society that they are nearly invisible” and that “most White Americans are unaware of the advantages they enjoy in this society and how their attitudes 107 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK  and actions unintentionally discriminate against persons of color”   MSM and Stop and Frisk are institutional level example of what promoted personal and interpersonal misconceptions and biases, fueled by the FDA limiting who can give blood. These types of policies enabled thoughts, behaviors, and actions against gay men that made them “other”.

(what is the goal):  Understanding,   Recognition, Acknowledgement, and Action Why is it important? Historical perspectives (given some slides w/ examples of microagression and the related historical perspective)  Video (20 minutes)       Direction of breaking up into small groups. Reminder that Azara and Ali will be available if a student wants to step away and talk privately.   Small Group Discussion (60 minutes) (7 groups of 12 with 2 facilitators each) (Azara and Ali will be available in Cascia or in your office as a resource in case student) (have students in circle). Groups will be split by number instead of identity to split up and mixup interactions with others. Will receive number at entrance.  (Using giant post-its) 1.

Action steps based on individual type of microagression to bring back to debrief  Case Studies (20 minutes)      110 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK   Examples of Racial Microaggressions Theme Microaggression Message  Alien in own land When Asian Americans and Latino Americans are assumed to be foreign-born “Where are you from?” “Where were you born?” “You speak good English.” A person asking an Asian American to teach them words in their native language. You are not American You are a foreigner Ascription of Intelligence Assigning intelligence to a person of color on the basis of their race. “You are a credit to your race.” “You are so articulate.” Asking an Asian person to help with a Math or Science problem. People of color are generally not as intelligent as Whites. It is unusual for someone of your race to be intelligent. All Asians are intelligent and good in Math / Sciences. Color Blindness Statements that indicate that a White person does not want to acknowledge race “When I look at you, I don’t see color.” “America is a melting pot.” “There is only one race, the human race.” Denying a person of color’s racial / ethnic experiences. Assimilate / acculturate to the dominant culture. Denying the individual as a racial / cultural being. Criminality – assumption of criminal status A person of color is presumed to be dangerous, criminal, or deviant on the basis of their race. A White man or woman clutching their purse or checking their wallet as a Black or Latino approaches or passes. A store owner following a customer of color around the store. A White person waits to ride the next elevator when a person of color is on it. You are a criminal. You are going to steal / You are poor / You do not belong / You are dangerous. Denial of individual racism A statement made when Whites deny their racial biases “I’m not a racist. I have several Black friends.” “As a woman, I know what you go through as a racial minority.” I am immune to races because I have friends of color. Your racial oppression is no different than my gender oppression. I can’t be a racist. I’m like you. Myth of meritocracy Statements which assert that race does not play a role in life successes “I believe the most qualified person should get the job.” “Everyone can succeed in this society, if they work hard enough.” People of color are given extra unfair benefits because of their race. People of color are lazy and / or incompetent and need to work harder. Pathologizing cultural values / communication styles The notion that the values and communication styles of the dominant / White culture are ideal Asking a Black person: “Why do you have to be so loud / animated? Just calm down.” To an Asian or Latino person: Why are you so quiet? We want to know what you think. Be more verbal.” Speak up more.” Dismissing an individual who brings up race / culture in work / school setting. Assimilate to dominant culture. Leave your cultural baggage outside.    111 FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK     Theme Microaggression Message  Second-class citizen Occurs when a White person is given preferential treatment as a consumer over a person of color Person of color mistaken for a service worker Having a taxi cab pass a person of color and pick up a White passenger Being ignored at a store counter as attention is given to the White customer behind you “You people …” People of color are servants to Whites. They couldn’t possibly occupy high-status positions. You are likely to cause trouble and / or travel to a dangerous neighborhood. Whites are more valued customers than people of color You don’t belong. You are a lesser being. Environmental microaggressions Macro-level microaggressions, which are more apparent on systemic and environmental levels A college or university with buildings that are all names after White heterosexual upper class males Television shows and movies that feature predominantly White people, without representation of people of color Overcrowding of public schools in communities of color Overabundance of liquor stores in communities of color You don’t belong / You won’t succeed here. There is only so far you can go. You are an outsider / You don’t exist. People of color don’t / shouldn’t value education. People of color are deviant. How to offend without really trying “Indian giver.” “That’s so gay.” “She welshed on the bet.” “I jewed him down.” “That’s so White of you.” “You people …” “We got gypped.” Imitating accents or dialects Others?    Adapted from: Wing, Capodilupo, Torino, Bucceri, Holder, Nadal, Esquilin (2007). Racial Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Implications for Clinical Practice. American Psychologist, 62(4), 271-286    FACULTY AND STAFF DIVERSITY TRAINING AT MERRIMACK 112  C2: America: Mosaic or Melting Pot Videoxx   1. Discussion questions: What is the difference between “assimilating” (covering one’s distinctive ethnic, religious, or other culture characteristics) and so-called “flaunting” (a negative term that has been used for the expression of distinctive, ethnic, religious or other cultural characteristics)?  Can you give some examples from the video of “flaunting” or “covering” one’s visible cultural markers?  2. Is “flaunt” a judgment term for public expression of cultural markers?  Can you think of examples that have been called “flaunting” in gay culture, religious culture, racial culture?  Examples in other marginalized cultures?  3. Can you think of examples of “covering” in gay culture, religious culture, racial culture?  Examples in other marginalized cultures? 4. Have you experienced or noticed examples of “covering” in higher education? At Merrimack? 5. Why might someone feel the need to cover or pass on a college campus?  (20 minutes)  i Cole, N. L.

    "abstract": "Diversity and inclusion training is essential for long-term success and sustainability of an organization, especially institutions of higher education (Cocchiara, Connerley, & Bell, 2010; Cunningham, 2012). This capstone investigates the necessity and benefits of diversity and inclusion training, as well as effective training structures to contextualize the resulting curriculum model. This curriculum addresses an underlying institutional leadership gap at Merrimack College where faculty and staff are not adequately trained or provided with sufficient opportunities to engage in diversity and inclusion training. Feminist Standpoint Theory (Collins, 1997) and Transformational Learning Theory (Mezirow, 2000) provide the theoretical grounding to establish this foundational diversity work and expand it further to create a diversity and inclusion training curriculum for faculty and staff at Merrimack College that dismantles the dominant discourse that sustains oppression, socialization, and marginalization. This capstone proposes initial educational resources that should be utilized as a foundation to adapt more strategic and comprehensive plans around building a more diverse and inclusive campus. This includes developing faculty and staff who are culturally competent, inclusive, and able to subvert and dismantle the dominant discourse. This capstone works to spur development of inclusive educational practices that will benefit Merrimack as a whole",
