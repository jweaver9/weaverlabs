Families, children and youth, who canno longer aﬀord shelter or who cannot stay with their families,are experiencing homelessness in record numbers. Despite thiscrisis and the overwhelming lack of aﬀordable housing andshelter space across the country, cities are increasingly penalizingpeople who are forced to live on our streets and in public spaces.is criminalization includes local ordinances prohibitingsleeping, sitting or lying down, or eating in public, as well asordinances that punish or prohibit churches, charitableorganizations and individuals from sharing food with homelessand other poor persons in public places. Many of these measuresviolate homeless persons’ civil and human rights, and appeardesigned to move homeless persons out of sight, or even out of agiven city. Rather than addressing the root causes ofhomelessness—namely the lack of aﬀordable housing,unemployment and poverty—these measures frequentlyperpetuate the problem. e National Law Center onHomelessness & Poverty’s recently released report, CriminalizingCrisis: e Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities,1documents the startling increase of local laws targeting homelesspersons, reviews the costs and human impacts of criminalizinghomelessness, and includes policy recommendations for endingcriminalization and addressing the root causes of homelessness. Criminalization takes a toll, not only on adults, but also on thegrowing numbers of families, children and unaccompanied youthexperiencing homelessness. is Making the Link issue reviewsthe increase in families, children and youth experiencinghomelessness, describes the criminalization measuresincreasingly being enacted and enforced against homelesspersons and the severe consequences of these measures, andprovides policy recommendations. DEMOGRAPHICS AND TRENDSWhat we’re ﬁnding more and more is that the traditionalimage many people may have about homelessness—of asingle person suﬀering with long-term substance abuse oreven mental illness—is really not the model we’re seeingemerging over the last few years in the economic crisis. Moreand more it’s families.–Department of Housing and Urban Development SecretaryShaun Donovan2e economic and foreclosure crises have fueled a dramaticincrease in families, children and youth experiencinghomelessness. Between 2007 and 2010, the number of people infamilies that were homeless increased by 20 percent.3 Similarly,in the 29 largest American cities surveyed for the 2011 U.S.Conference of Mayors Annual Report on Hunger andHomelessness, family homelessness increased by 16 percentduring the period between September 1, 2010, and August 31,2011, and oﬃcials in the majority of these cities predicted thatfamily homelessness would increase even more in 2012.4 Giventhat children make up 60 percent of the individuals in homelessfamilies, family homelessness is the most salient contributor tothe trend of increasing child homelessness.5 e National Centeron Family Homelessness estimates that homelessness amongchildren increased by 38 percent from 2007 to 2010.6American Families, Punished forPoverty: The Criminalization ofHomelessness in the United StatesBy Heather Maria Johnson, Civil Rights Attorney, and Maria Foscarinis, Founder and Executive Director, National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty  Making the Link •  A Publication of Grantmakers for Children, Youth & Families2 | Issue 4  • 2012                                                                                                                                                                                 gcyf.orge main causes of homelessness among families with childrenare unemployment, lack of aﬀordable housing, poverty, low-paying jobs and domestic violence.7 In particular, high housingcosts relative to income present a large ﬁnancial barrier to low-income families in the U.S. Findings from the National LowIncome Housing Coalition show that there is no state in the U.S.where an individual working full-time at minimum wage canaﬀord an average two-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent,the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s estimateof what a family moving today can expect to pay in rent andutilities for a modest rental unit in the current market.8 eforeclosure crisis has only exacerbated the eﬀect on families atrisk of becoming homeless. On average, one in every 639housing units received a foreclosure ﬁling in May 2012.9 Already,2.3 million children have lost their homes to foreclosure andanother 6 million children live in homes that are at risk offoreclosure.10Although families experiencing homelessness often ﬁndassistance from extended family networks or in emergencyshelters, these resources are unavailable or short-lived for many.Emergency shelters in two thirds of the cities surveyed for the2011 U.S. Conference of Mayors report indicated that they hadturned away homeless families with children because they had nobeds available for those families.11 Likewise, across the surveyedcities, approximately 24 percent of people in need of emergencyfood assistance did not receive it.12 Shelters often impose limitson length of stay, and the pressures of overcrowding (includingpotential legal risks for the host family) typically make doubling-up with friends and family an untenable long-term option. Homelessness also has a disproportionate impact onunaccompanied youth and youth aging out of foster care. Eachyear, approximately 30,000 youth age out of foster care.13 Youthaging out of foster care face high rates of homelessness—54percent of those who have recently aged out are homeless orunstably housed.14 In the majority of states, ﬁnancial support forfoster placements ends at age 18, after which time youth mustﬁnd their own housing.15 Some states have laws that prohibitdischarging youth into homelessness, but these laws are notalways enforced.16 Unaccompanied youth are most likely to leavehome and become homeless because of parental abuse and/orneglect, including physical or sexual abuse, parental substanceabuse or youth substance dependency, parental mental healthissues, or severe family conﬂict.17Approximately one in 45 American children experiencehomelessness,18 with an estimated 1.6 million unaccompaniedyouth between the ages of 12 and 17 experiencing homelessnessin a given year before the recession.19 Some studies have foundthat the demographics of homeless youth generally reﬂect thedemographics of their local area, but other studies have shownthat minority groups are overrepresented among homelessyouth.20 Statistics from the Department of Justice reveal thatapproximately 57 percent of homeless youth are Caucasian, 17percent are Black or African American, and 15 percent areHispanic or Latino.21 A signiﬁcant proportion of homelessyouth—between 20 and 40 percent—identify as lesbian, gay,bisexual or transgendered.22THE CRIMINALIZATION OF HOMELESSNESSDespite the worsening housing and homelessness crisis, citiesacross the country are increasingly adopting local ordinances orpolicies that criminalize homelessness. Such measures take anumber of forms, but frequently involve restrictions on the use ofpublic space, such as prohibitions on sleeping, sitting, lying downor keeping belongings in public spaces. Many such measures mayseem innocuous at ﬁrst glance—for instance, bans on “camping,”urinating in public or loitering—but, in practice, can be nearlyimpossible for those living without shelter to avoid violating, orare used by law enforcement to target homeless people in publicspaces. In addition, many cities conduct sweeps of areas in whichhomeless persons are living to drive them out of those areas,frequently resulting in the destruction of individuals’ personalproperty including important personal documents andmedication. Given the dire lack of adequate aﬀordable housingand shelter space in cities across the country, laws that penalizehomeless people for engaging in activities needed for survivalwhile in public places essentially criminalize the status of beinghomeless.  In 2011, the Law Center surveyed municipal law in 234American cities and found that the vast majority (approximately96 percent) had multiple laws criminalizing homelessness.22Furthermore, between 2009 and 2011, the number ofcriminalization measures increased. For example, during thistime period there was a 7 percent increase in prohibitions on“camping” in particular public places and a 10 percent increase inprohibitions on loitering in particular public places.24Another disturbing trend is the enactment of local ordinancesprohibiting or restricting charitable and religious organizationsfrom sharing food with homeless and other poor persons inpublic places. For instance, in 2006, Las Vegas enacted anordinance prohibiting sharing food with “indigent” persons inpublic parks. e law deﬁned “indigent” as a person whom areasonable ordinary person would believe to be entitled to applyfor or receive public assistance.25 Dallas places burdensomerestrictions on churches and other charitable organizations thatwish to share food with homeless individuals in public andseverely limits where these organizations can provide food.26Recently, Philadelphia enacted a ban on sharing food in all cityparks.27Making the Link •  A Publication of Grantmakers for Children, Youth & Familiesgcyf.org                                                                                                                                                       Issue 4  • 2012  | 3Such criminalization measures violate homeless persons’ civil andhuman rights, as well as the civil rights of the providers andcharitable organizations. When there is not adequate shelterspace, citations and arrests for sleeping or resting outside canviolate homeless people’s Eighth Amendment right to be freefrom cruel and unusual punishment.28 ese ordinances may alsopenalize homeless persons’ fundamental right to travel bydenying them a necessity of life—a place to sleep—whichprevents them from staying within or traveling to the city.29Courts have overturned anti-loitering and vagrancy laws thatwere vague and encouraged arbitrary enforcement by policeoﬃcers.30 ey have also found that sweeps, in which oﬃcersconﬁscate or destroy homeless persons’ belongings, violate theFourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searchesand seizures and due process rights.31 e Law Center andpartner organizations recently achieved a victory in theirchallenge to St. Petersburg, FL’s practice of banning—withoutany avenue for appeal—homeless persons from public parks,sidewalks, bus stops and other public spaces, pursuant to thecity’s trespass ordinance. e Eleventh Circuit Court of Appealsheld that homeless plaintiﬀs who had been banned from publicareas of the city had legal claims for violations of their right tointrastate travel and due process rights.32Similarly, restrictions on food sharing or provision of otherservices to homeless persons can violate the Equal Protectionclause of the Fourteenth Amendment and service providers’ freeexercise of religion, and can be unconstitutionally vague. e LasVegas food-sharing ordinance was repealed after a successfullegal challenge.33 e Dallas and Philadelphia food-sharingrestrictions are currently being challenged in federal court, withthe Law Center and pro bono counsel litigating the challenge tothe Dallas law.34Such measures also implicate human rights principles, andspeciﬁc commitments made by the U.S. in internationalcovenants, such as the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights35 and the International Convention on theElimination of Racial Discrimination.36 ese commitmentsbind the U.S. at all levels—federal, state and local—and prohibitlaws and policies that have a discriminatory or disproportionateimpact on those who are poor or lack property, as well as onracial or ethnic minorities. Advocates are increasingly includinghuman rights arguments in challenging criminalizationmeasures, with growing success. For example, advocates in SaltLake City, supported by the Law Center, mounted a humanrights campaign to challenge the city’s anti-camping ordinance.As a result of the campaign, the Salt Lake City police stoppedenforcing the ordinance against homeless persons and instead tryto engage people living on the street and provide availableresources. In addition, advocates are engaging internationalmonitoring entities to support their campaigns. Most recently,for example, the Law Center has been working with the U.N.’stop independent expert on extreme poverty, who issued a reportcondemning the criminalization of homelessness in the U.S. andother countries as violative of human rights norms.37 Followingthe report’s release in 2011, the Law Center facilitated a meetingbetween the expert and federal agencies, including U.S. Housingand Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Justice(DOJ), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness(USICH), to discuss these agencies’ obligations to protecthomeless people from criminalization. Due in part to the LawCenter’s advocacy eﬀorts, the USICH and DOJ recently releaseda report critical of criminalization, which encourages theadoption of constructive alternatives.38 Currently, the LawCenter is working with the U.N. expert and the U.S. StateDepartment on a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution condemningthe criminalization of homelessness and poverty.The Effects of Criminalizing Homelessness Beyond limiting homeless persons’ legal use of public space, theiraccess to food and their ability to live without fear of citation orarrest, criminalization measures can have a long-lasting negativeimpact. Criminalization creates barriers to employment, housingand services. Beyond that, it aﬀects the ability of homelesspersons to remain in their communities over time, to maintainstable and intact families, and to be politically engaged forthemselves and for their families. Homeless youth face additionalbarriers often due to their status as minors and increased scrutinyfrom law enforcement. Barriers to Employment, Housing and ServicesWhen someone is cited or arrested for violating a criminalizationmeasure, the criminal justice consequences substantially hinderhis or her ability to seek and maintain employment, housing andbeneﬁts needed to support a family. Not only will the individualhave a citation or arrest on his or her record, but he or she willalso be required to travel to and attend court appearances (or faceadditional criminal sanctions), and may be sentenced to jail timeor ﬁnes that he or she cannot aﬀord to pay (which can lead tomore sanctions). Homeless individuals who are employed may beforced to miss work, which jeopardizes their employment.Having a criminal record also makes it more diﬃcult to ﬁnd newemployment. More than 90 percent of large employers conductcriminal background checks on some or all job applicants,39 andsome employers have blanket policies excluding fromemployment not only those convicted of serious crimes oroﬀenses but also those with misdemeanor convictions, and, insome cases, arrests that did not lead to conviction.40e criminalization of necessary, life-sustaining acts can alsomake the already diﬃcult process of securing housing even morediﬃcult. Having a criminal record not only makes private rentalsharder to obtain, but also can limit access to public housing.Making the Link •  A Publication of Grantmakers for Children, Youth & Families4 | Issue 4  • 2012                                                                                                                                                                                 gcyf.orgToward the end of 2010, a family of two parents and threechildren that had been experiencing homelessness for a year anda half applied for a two-bedroom apartment. e day before ascheduled meeting with the apartment manager during the ﬁnalstages of acquiring the lease, the father of the family was arrestedfor public urination. e arrest occurred at an hour when nopublic restrooms were available for use. Because of the arrest, thefather was unable to make the appointment with the apartmentmanager and the property was rented out to another person.Several months later, the family was still homeless and searchingfor housing. Instead of taking a step forward and establishing astable housing situation, the family’s homelessness continued.41Guidelines from HUD, including its “One Strike and You’reOut” policy, recommend that Public Housing Authorities(PHAs) use overly exclusive policies when determining whetheran applicant with a criminal record is eligible for publichousing.42 Although HUD issued new guidance in 2011emphasizing that PHAs have discretion in making thisdetermination, and encouraging PHAs to allow those withcriminal convictions to reunite with their families in HUD-subsidized housing,43 few PHAs have changed their policies.Many PHAs have policies allowing ineligibility based solely onarrest records even if the charges were later dropped.44 Fewprovide a meaningful evaluation of the applicant’s conduct or theseriousness of the oﬀense before issuing a rejection.45Criminalization makes it substantially more diﬃcult forhomeless people to access needed beneﬁts and services and candisrupt existing relationships with service providers. Many statesexclude people with misdemeanor convictions from receivingpublic housing assistance,46 and other beneﬁts, such asSupplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security DisabilityInsurance, Medicaid, Medicare and Department of VeteransAﬀairs (VA) pension beneﬁts, suspended after a period ofincarceration, may not be restored until after a lengthy eligibilityreview.47 For instance, SSI and other beneﬁts are suspendedwhile a person is incarcerated and reinstatement requires an in-person visit to a Social Security Administration oﬃceimmediately following release, resulting in a delay of beneﬁts.48Some states also prohibit those with outstanding ﬁnes, courtcosts or restitution from collecting state-administered beneﬁtssuch as medical and cash assistance.49Family Integrity, Community Participation and EducationalStabilitye criminalization of homelessness can lead to additional,ancillary negative eﬀects on families, exacerbating the alreadydebilitating impacts of homelessness. ese impacts can trigger adownward spiral that further marginalizes families and adverselyaﬀects their children and their future. e barriers to employment, housing and services that can resultfrom criminalization perpetuate homelessness and can make itextremely diﬃcult for homeless people to maintain stablefamilies. e arrest or incarceration of a parent clearly hasimplications for the entire family; indeed, it may result in familyseparation and placement of the children in foster care if there isnot another parent or family member to care for the children. Inaddition, and apart from the problem of criminalization,homeless families are already at risk for separation, simply basedon their status. Although homelessness should not by itself begrounds for separating families, there is evidence that as a matterof practice some child welfare agencies do remove children fromtheir families on the basis of homelessness.50Homelessness often requires relocation, as families double upwith others, move into a shelter or seek refuge in public spaces.Criminalization may further contribute to the need forrelocation, for instance, when a criminal record preventshomeless families or individuals from securing or remaining inshelter in their communities, or requires them to abandon publicplaces. is can strain families’ ties with their home community;it can also have a detrimental eﬀect on children’s education. TitleVII of the federal McKinney-Vento Act allows homelesschildren to stay in the same school when it is in the child’s bestinterest, and school districts are required to providetransportation for children back to their school of origin.51However, despite these strong legal protections, the provisions ofthe McKinney-Vento education program are often violated. As aresult, homeless children are forced to change schools or are keptout of school altogether. Furthermore, although the McKinney-Vento education provisions state that guardianship requirementsmay not be used as a reason to keep children out of school, as amatter of practice children are sometimes denied enrollment inschool if not accompanied by a parent or an oﬃcial guardian. earrest or incarceration of a parent because of the criminalizationof homelessness may prevent access to school for their children.Without school stability or even the ability to continue theireducation, homeless children are severely injured and their futureprospects diminished. Policies criminalizing homelessness can also make it morediﬃcult for homeless persons to exercise their right to vote andinﬂuence policies aﬀecting themselves and their families.Homeless persons already face numerous obstacles whenregistering and casting their ballots. For instance, stateregulations for proving residence, providing a mailing addressand showing identiﬁcation at the polls can raise diﬃculties forhomeless voters who meet their state’s eligibility requirements.Policies criminalizing homelessness—particularly “sweeps” andconﬁscation of homeless persons’ belongings and laws that forcehomeless persons to move frequently—often result in the loss ofidentiﬁcation and other important documents such as birthcertiﬁcates.52 Given the proliferation of voter ID laws, combinedwith stringent requirements for getting or replacing IDs, the lossMaking the Link •  A Publication of Grantmakers for Children, Youth & Familiesgcyf.org                                                                                                                                                       Issue 4  • 2012  | 5or conﬁscation of an ID card results in an inability to exerciseone’s fundamental right to vote. Impacts on Homeless Youthe barriers erected by criminalization measures can beespecially diﬃcult for homeless youth and youth aging out offoster care. ere is some evidence that homeless youth aretargeted by law enforcement and receive a disproportionate shareof citations and arrests for violations of criminalizationordinances.  Un-emancipated minors may not legally be able toapply for employment and housing, thus further limiting theiroptions. Moreover, the majority of U.S. states explicitly authorize juvenilecurfews,54 which prohibit young persons from being on the streetand in other public spaces at stated times of the day. Youth whoare on their own often have no choice but to be on the streetafter curfew because of the limited availability of shelter space,and their inability to aﬀord or legally rent a residence. Inaddition, many U.S. states and jurisdictions criminalize runningaway, truancy and harboring a minor, creating further barriers forhomeless children and youth.55 Indeed, many states have“children in need of services” or “CHINS” statutes providing thatyoung people “need supervision” in a variety of circumstancesincluding running away from home.56 is status authorizespolice and other government oﬃcials to take young people intocustody.57 In addition, many homeless youth have limited accessto health care services because most states do not authorize orrequire provision of health care services to unaccompanied youthwithout court involvement.58e criminalization of truancy is of particular concern forhomeless children and youth. Under the McKinney-Vento Act,homeless students have a right to continued, stable education59;however, if a school violates this right, the student may be keptout of school—and thus made “truant” through no fault of herown.60 Denial of access to school, in violation of the law, is aparticularly unfair form of “school discipline.” Criminalizing theresulting “truancy” further compounds the injury, challenging thechances for a positive outcome. Given the rapid growth ofhomelessness among students, this is an issue that deservesincreased attention. Policy ConcernsLaws that criminalize engaging in necessary, life-sustainingactivities in public spaces do not address the root causes ofhomelessness and instead perpetuate homelessness. As describedpreviously, criminalization measures create signiﬁcant barriers toobtaining employment, housing and social services that canmake it substantially more diﬃcult for homeless families andyouth to move out of homelessness. is takes a signiﬁcant tollon those experiencing homelessness, and carries a hefty cost tothe public. In addition, criminalization measures burden thecriminal justice system and are actually more expensive thanadopting more humane and constructive approaches tohomelessness. Costs studies conducted in 13 cities and statesrevealed that, on average, cities spend $87 per day to housesomeone in jail versus approximately $28 a day for shelter.61Utah’s largest homeless shelter, e Road Home, studiedhomelessness costs and found that the annual costs for a personin permanent supportive housing is about $6,100 and the annualcosts for providing emergency shelter is about $6,600.62 Incontrast, the annual costs of housing someone in the county jailand the state prison were $25,500 and $35,000, respectively.63e cost diﬀerence with respect to homeless youth is even morestark. A study conducted by Urban Peak, a Coloradoorganization working with homeless and runaway youth, foundthat the average annual cost of placing a homeless youth in thecriminal justice system is approximately $53,700, whereas theaverage cost of permanently moving a homeless youth oﬀ thestreets – including placing the youth in independent permanent,transitional, or supportive housing or reunifying the youth withhis or her family – is only about $5,900.64POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS &CONCLUSION Although many cities are exacerbating the problem ofhomelessness by criminalizing it, some cities are adoptinginitiatives that instead address the root causes of homelessness oraim to limit the devastating eﬀects of criminalization. Someexamples include: \u0000 Minneapolis and Hennepin County, MN. In January 2007,Hennepin County developed a 10-year plan to addresshomelessness. As part of the plan, the Street OutreachProgram was created to connect homeless individuals withneeded services and divert them from involvement with thecriminal justice system. e program has succeeded inhousing a number of individuals in addition to reducing theamount of public dollars spent on each homeless person.65\u0000 Portland, OR. In 2006, Portland Commissioner RandyLeonard began the development of e Portland Loo, aninnovative public bathroom that stays open 24 hours a dayand is powered completely through solar energy. Currently,the City of Portland has a Loo in place in four separatelocations. Providing a 24/7 public bathroom reduces the needfor homeless people to resort to public urination or defecationand helps prevent the criminalization of this basic humanneed.66\u0000 Puyallup, WA. In 2010, Puyallup passed an ordinance thatallows religious organizations to host temporaryencampments for homeless individuals. e ordinance was theMaking the Link •  A Publication of Grantmakers for Children, Youth & Families6 | Issue 4  • 2012                                                                                                                                                                                 gcyf.orgresult of an advocacy campaign, in which the Law Centerparticipated, to address the persistent homeless sweeps andenforcement of anti-camping laws despite a clear lack ofaﬀordable housing or shelter space.67\u0000 Orlando, FL. Once a month in Orlando, governmentagencies and local service providers come together for anevent called IDignity, which helps homeless persons apply forvarious types of government identiﬁcation. e mostcommonly applied for are driver’s licenses, Social Securitycards and birth certiﬁcates. e ﬁrst IDignity event was heldin May 2008 and it has helped more than 6,500 homelessindividuals secure employment, housing and public beneﬁts.68Criminalization is not a feasible solution to homelessness. As apolicy, it is completely ineﬀective and only exacerbates the factorsthat contribute to individuals’ homelessness. Cities can undertakepolicy alternatives that reach their goal—lowering the number ofhomeless individuals in their community—not only moreeﬀectively but also more humanely. Here are a few examples: \u0000 Stopping the enactment of laws that criminalize homelesspersons, such as prohibitions on sleeping, camping orengaging in other necessary, life-sustaining activities in publicwhen shelter is not available, and food sharing restrictions;declassifying running away and truancy as crimes forhomeless children and youth; removing restrictions onharboring minors; and eliminating curfews and CHINSstatutes;\u0000 Preventing the use of federal grant funding to pay forcriminalization activities at the state or local level, whileauthorizing and appropriating state and local funds targetedtoward homeless individuals, families and children and youth;\u0000 Establishing a council that includes homeless persons,providers and advocates to provide oversight of ordinancesand practices that have a negative impact on homelesspersons;\u0000 Enacting laws that focus speciﬁcally on the welfare ofhomeless children and youth, including permitting minors toenter into contracts for necessities (such as real property,employment, educational loans, admission to school, medicaland mental health care and treatment, bank accounts, andadmission to shelter, housing and supportive serviceprograms) and establishing emancipation procedures in allstates and jurisdictions;\u0000 Establishing police and other protocols that ensure homelesspersons’ civil rights are protected; similarly, conducting policetrainings and establishing homeless liaisons within the policedepartment can help foster improved relationships betweenpolice and people experiencing homelessness; \u0000 Providing more aﬀordable housing and other resources to notonly preempt the occurrence of criminalized behavior, but toalso help provide a more cost-eﬀective approach of ensuringstable access to education for homeless children and youth bydecreasing frequent residency and school changes, amongother things; and\u0000 Making sure local, state and federal governments work toensure that all homeless families and youth have access to safeand aﬀordable housing.
