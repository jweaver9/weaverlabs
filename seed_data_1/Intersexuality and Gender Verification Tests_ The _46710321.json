[Vol.  XXIII::n I.  INTRODUCTION Intersexuality is a topic that rarely enters mainstream discussion.  It has, however, been at the forefront of several disciplines.  Intersexuality has been defined by the medical community, and research in the medical field has focused largely on sex assignment surgeries at the time of birth.  Psychologists have attempted to define intersexuality and the “symp-toms” associated with it when an individual is diagnosed as intersex.  Anthropologists reveal that in primitive societies intersex individuals were outcasts, while in others, they were revered.  Social scientists also suggest that gender is a social construct, not something that is biological-ly determinative.  The legal system has failed in its protections of inter-sex most of the time.  An issue that arises is that intersexuality has not been examined from an interdisciplinary or integrative approach.  While the medical community and the social sciences have addressed the condi-tion, the legal system has largely ignored it; thus, basic human rights have not been extended to those with an intersex condition. This may partly be due to the fact that the condition is somewhat invisible—that is at least until a person‟s sexuality is questioned and examined.  Making intersexuality visible in the eyes of the law will allow intersex persons to enjoy the same human rights afforded to others. Part II of this Comment will discuss the basic foundation of how in-tersexuality is examined in various fields.  Part III of this Comment will trace the timeline of gender verification testing in sports from the early part of the 1900s through the current controversy involving South Afri-can runner, Caster Semenya.  The discrimination that often results from the use of gender verification tests will be explained.  Part IV of this Comment will discuss gender-based legal protections in sports by sum-marizing and analyzing the applicable provisions of the Universal Decla-ration of Human Rights and will encourage the international community to place laws on its books to protect the rights of intersex people.  Part V will address the need for balancing an athlete‟s right to privacy and un-due intrusion against the prevailing interests of the state in ensuring that other athletes can compete on a fair playing field with other members of their ascribed sex.  Additionally, recommendations for building aware-ness and tolerance of intersex individuals will be set forth. 2http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 2011] Intersexuality and Gender Verification Tests: The Need to Assure Human Rights and Privacy  217 II.  INTERSEXUALITY A.  Biological/Medical Influences Several medical and law journals have discussed intersexuality by defining it from a physiological perspective.1  Since the 1900s, Western medicine has regarded intersexuality as “a medical condition, a disorder of sex development, requiring life-long medical treatment, with genital abnormalities being corrected by surgery to allow so-called normal sex-ual function.”2  Approximately 1.7% of children are born intersex worldwide each year.3  The medical community, in its management of intersex individuals, identifies at least four biological sex differences:  genes, gonads, genitals, and brain.4  Accord Alliance5 defines intersex as: a term sometimes used to refer to the condition of having a sex anatomy that is not considered standard for a male or female . . . it is an umbrella term that covers many different conditions that appear in humans as well as other animals.The term is often used by adults with DSDs [Disorders of Sex Development] to talk about their bodies and their experiences.6 DSDs include (1) congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)7, XX ka-                                               1 Kurt Hirschhorn, Human Genetics, 224 JAMA 597 (1973); see also Natascha Gru-ber, Ethics in Medicine: With a Special Focus on the Concepts of Sex and Gender in In-tersex Management, 12 CARDOZO J.L. & GENDER 117 (2005); Noa Ben-Asher, The Ne-cessity of Sex Change: A Struggle for Intersex and Transsex Liberties, 29 HARV.

It is only recently that attitudes towards individuals with DSDs have begun to change.13 B.  Psychological Influences The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders14 per-mits clinicians to code individuals with an intersex condition as “Gender Identity Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS).”15  Individuals who cannot be coded with having a specific Gender Identity Disorder may re-ceive this diagnosis.  Examples of intersex conditions include partial an-drogen insensitivity syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia and ac-companying gender dysphoria (emphasis added).16  Gender Identity Disorder NOS is an Axis I Clinical Disorder.17  An advantage of a mul-tiaxial system is that it provides a clinician with guidelines “for organiz-ing and communicating clinical information, for capturing the complexi-ty of clinical situations, and for describing the heterogeneity of individuals presenting with the same diagnosis.”18  However, at least one NOS category is used for each diagnostic class when individuals present with a variety of symptoms that do not map precisely to a given “diag-nostic nomenclature.”19                                                12 5 ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA 874 (Robert McHenry ed., 15th ed. 1992) available at http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263151/hermaphro-ditism (last visited Sept. 20, 2010). 13 Olaf Hiort, Alternative Gender Categories in Different Cultures: Lessons to Be Learnt, 69 HORMONE RES. 251, 251 (2008). 14 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental of Mental Disorders is the ma-nual currently used in culturally diverse populations in the United States and internation-ally.  The wide international acceptance of the Manual suggests that this classification is useful in describing mental disorders as they are experienced by individuals throughout the world. 15 AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS (DSM-IV-TR) 582 (4th ed., Text Rev., American Psychiatric Asso-ciation 2000) [hereinafter DSM-IV]. 16 Id. at 823 (defining gender dysphoria as “a persistent aversion toward some or all of those physical characteristics or social roles that connote one‟s own biological sex”). 17 The DSM-IV categorizes disorders within a multiaxial system.  Each axis pertains to a different area of information and criteria used to assist the clinician in creating a treatment plan and assessing outcomes for a given diagnosis. 18 DSM-IV, supra note 15, at 27. 19 Id. at 4. 5BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 220 PACE INT‟L L. REV. [Vol.  XXIII::n An NOS diagnosis may be appropriate in four situations,20 two of which appear most relevant to intersex individuals.  First, when “there is an uncertainty about etiology (i.e., whether the disorder is due to a gen-eral medical condition . . . ).”21  Second, when “there is insufficient op-portunity for complete data collection (e.g., in emergency situations) or inconsistent or contradictory information, but there is enough informa-tion to place it within a particular diagnostic class.”22  The fact that the intersex condition is coded as NOS is itself problematic.  The NOS cod-ing suggests that the international psychiatric and psychological com-munities have not come to a consensus of what it means to be intersex, that intersex could be a general medical condition,23 or that there have not been enough individuals presenting with similar symptoms to fit them into a particular diagnostic class.  Furthermore, and most impor-tantly, “Gender Identity Disorder NOS” requires an intersex condition and accompanying gender dysphoria (emphasis added).  In other words, an individual with this diagnosis would have to have an intersex condi-tion plus “a persistent aversion toward some or all of those physical cha-racteristics or social roles that connote one‟s own biological sex.”24  If an intersex condition means neither male nor female or both male and fe-male, and biological sex cannot be determined by the binary system, the characteristics or social roles that would attach to intersex are arguably unknown; therefore, it is difficult to understand how one could have an aversion to the unknown. Because the DSM-IV is used globally by clinicians with diverse cul-tural and ethnic groups, a supplemental outline for cultural formulation to assist in diagnostic assessment is provided.  An “individual‟s cultural background, the role of the cultural context in the expression and evalua-tion of symptoms and dysfunction, and the effect that cultural differences may have on the relationship between the individual and the clinician”25 are reviewed in order to properly “describe systematically the individu-al‟s cultural and social reference group and ways in which the cultural                                                20 Id. 21 Id. 22 Id. 23 DSM-IV, supra note 15, at xxxv (The term „general medical condition‟ is used for convenience and does not “imply that there is any fundamental distinction between men-tal disorders and general medical conditions, that mental disorders are unrelated to physi-cal or biological factors or processes, or that general medical conditions are unrelated to behavioral or psychosocial factors or processes”). 24 Id. at 823. 25 Id. at 897. 6http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 2011] Intersexuality and Gender Verification Tests: The Need to Assure Human Rights and Privacy  221 context is relevant”26 to diagnosis and treatment.  For example, a clini-cian is advised to note norms of the cultural/ethnic/social reference group, any local illness or disorder category utilized by the individual‟s family and community to identify the condition, and the perceived causes or explanatory models/theories of the disorder/illness.27  It is possible, perhaps, that two individuals presenting with the same symptoms would be diagnosed differently, or one might not be diagnosed at all, once cul-tural factors are considered.  Thus, guidelines for diagnosis of the inter-sex condition are not universal.   In some societies, adults with intersex conditions have reported psy-chological difficulties including “coping with intersex-specific expe-riences, such as atypical somatosexual and psychosocial development, medical interventions, and the repeated experience of being different from other boys and girls, men and women.”28  Additionally, psychoso-cial development may be impeded as the intersex individual may not know how to cope with reactions from parents and family members.  Emotional reactions, “such as insecurity, anxiety and shame,” may “re-sult[ing] in silence and taboo.”29   John Money‟s “Optimal Gender Policy”30 was developed in the 1950s as a method to lessen the stigma associated with intersex condi-tions, and although it was widely accepted in Canada, the U.K. and much of Europe at the time, today it is not as widely accepted since it has been found that there is a “lack of medical necessity, violation of informed                                                26 Id. 27 Id. at 898. 28Coping Female, supra note 11, at 189 (citing PEGGY TINE COHEN-KETTENIS AND FRIEDEMANN PFӓFFLIN, TRANSGENDERISM AND INTERSEXUALITY IN CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE: MAKING CHOICES (Sage Publications 2003); Milton Diamond, Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation in Children with Traumatized or Ambiguous Ge-nitalia, 34 J.

C.  Social/Anthropological Influences Recent empirical studies have examined the societal manifestations of the gender binary system in Western societies.  Being born with, or later discovering, an intersex condition has proven to be a challenging situation in terms of both group norms and individual experience.  As part of a larger research project on quality of life conducted in Germany, Schweizer et al. conducted interviews with seven individuals with vari-ous intersex conditions in an effort to understand their coping mechan-isms (1) at the time of puberty and (2) in response to binary gender con-ception.32  The second item, in response to binary gender conception, will be the focus of this section.  All seven participants appeared as bio-logical females at birth, all were assigned female at birth, and all live in the female gender role currently.33  However, all faced developmental difficulties during their lives primarily due to lack of support from others when trying to determine how they fit into the gender binary system.  Gender satisfaction was assessed in the study and participants were asked whether having a third gender category would have made their develop-ment more favorable.34  The participants were divided on whether a third gender category should be introduced.  Some of the participants argued that the gender binary does exist, but that masculinity and femininity ex-ist on a continuum and that “these variations should be socially and ethi-cally accepted.”35  Another stated that the two genders should just be eradicated.36  Lastly, one participant wrote: Every intersex person should choose in which gender role she wishes to live officially.  Whoever is not able to do so should be entitled to live as an intersexual or asexual human being.  It is important that intersex conditions are recognized as something existing in actuality, which do[es] not need to                                                31 Id. at 2. 32 See Coping Female, supra note 11, at 192. 33 Id. at 193. 34 Id. at 194. 35 Id. at 197. 36 Id. 8http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 2011] Intersexuality and Gender Verification Tests: The Need to Assure Human Rights and Privacy  223 be erased by therapy . . .37 Overall, the authors observed that participants‟ “feelings of other-ness” are characteristic of the intersex experience and that they expe-rience more than only a male or female gender identity.38  This “feeling of otherness” can be detrimental to one‟s development when living in a society that abides by a rigid male-female stratification.   While issues of gender socialization and identity may be present in Western societies, some non-Western societies have alternative gender categories.  An anthropological literature review of the last 100 years re-veals that people living in a „neither-male-nor-female‟ status can be found in a variety of cultures.39  In some of these cultures, a third gender, or sense of otherness, is celebrated; in others, it represents social or sex-ual deviance.  Nonetheless, it is hypothesized that “the cultural back-ground is a critical determinant for the development of an individual‟s gender role and/or gender status within a society.”40 Societies in which intersexuality has been accepted include those in North America, Dominican Republic, Papua-New Guinea, and the Tau-rus Mountain Range in Turkey.41  Among the North American Navajo tribe, an alternative gender was recognized for those who were inter-sex—nadleehe (or nadle).42  A group held in considerable prestige, nadle were often called upon to act as mediators during arguments between men and women.43  Nadle fulfilled a social neither-male-nor-female cat-egory, but they were revered as being omnipotent because they could carry out duties of both men and women.44  The guevedoce of the Domi-nican Republic are regarded as a “true third gender status.”45  Although the guevedoce are reared and socialized as females, during puberty high levels of testosterone influence the development of a masculine gender role and identity.46  It is suspected that the guevedoce are well-accepted because males enjoy a higher status than females in machismo socie-                                               37 Coping Female, supra note 11, at 197. 38 Id. at 197-98. 39 Alternative Gender, supra note 2, at 241. 40 Id. 41 Id. at 242-43. 42 Id. at 243. 43 Id. at 244. 44 Alternative Gender, supra note 2, at 244. 45 Id. at 242. 46 Id. 9BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 224 PACE INT‟L L. REV. [Vol.  XXIII::n ties.47  In the Taurus Mountains of Turkey, an intersex individual may opt to undergo sex assignment surgery or continue to live in a neither-male-nor-female gender status without ridicule from others.48  In Papua-New Guinea, a country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, “three sex categories, men, women, and kwolu-aatmwol („female thing which transforms into a male thing‟)” are recognized.49  Because the status of kwolu-aatmwol “is thought to be associated with special spiritual abilities,” the kwolu-aatmwol are not discriminated against.   Furthermore, the early work of anthropologist Margaret Mead en-dorses the view that cultural conditioning plays a greater role in shaping individuals‟ gender roles than biology does.50  Mead examined three primitive societies in New Guinea.  In one, the Arapesh, Mead found that both biological men and women display characteristics and behaviors typical of what Western cultures would consider feminine.  For example, both sexes were socialized “to be cooperative, unaggressive [,and] res-ponsive to the needs and demands of others.”51  In a second society, the Mundugumor, both biological men and women were found to possess traits and behaviors most typically associated with the Western ideal of masculinity—violence and aggressiveness.52  While the Arapesh and the Mundugumor societies do not have a gender binary, the third society does.  The Tchambuli exhibit essentially a role reversal when compared to the Western world.  The Tchambuli woman is “the dominant, imper-sonal, managing partner,” while the Tchambuli man is “the less responsi-ble and the emotionally dependent person.”53  The findings of Mead and other anthropologists suggest that gender binary is not absolute and uni-versal.  Moreover, their research supports the proposition that gender roles are culturally manufactured.  Other societies have treated a third gender category as unfavorable.  In the Pokot Tribe of West-Central Kenya, hermaphrodites are called                                                47 Id. 48 Id. 49 Alternative Gender, supra note 2, at 242. 50 MARGARET MEAD, SEX AND TEMPERAMENT IN THREE PRIMITIVE SOCIETIES (Har-perCollins Publishers 1935), reprinted in SEEING OURSELVES: CLASSIC, CONTEMPORARY, AND CROSS-CULTURAL READINGS IN SOCIOLOGY, at 237 (John J.

By some contradiction, however, hijra are often called upon to sing and dance during weddings and births, highly regarded religious rites of In-dian society.60 D.  Legal Influences The law regarding intersexuality has been largely undeveloped or ignored in some instances.  In the United States, intersexuality has been explored in the realms of marriage, employment, criminal justice, and human rights—with all case law holding that the law does not provide protection to those of intersex status.  On an international level, Colom-bia and Australia seem to be the only countries that have begun to pro-vide some protection for intersex individuals.  1.

Frankle notes:  [L]imitations on marriage affect a greater number of people than is first evident. That is, an apparently heterosexual marriage could be successfully challenged if one person is unknowingly intersex.  Confining marriage to between two people of the opposite sex leads to problems deciding what an opposite sex couple is and who defines an opposite sex couple.62   In Littleton v. Prange, the Texas Court of Appeals held that the law will not recognize a marriage between a male-to-female transsexual and a male.63  The court did state, however, that it may be more difficult to determine the validity of a marriage when an individual‟s “chromosomal, gonadal, and genital tests are not congruent.”64  This is because binary classification into male or female would be impossible.  An intersex per-son could be barred from legally marrying anyone because the intersex person does not fit the definition of male or female.  Nonetheless, the court declined to offer an opinion on the validity of marriage of an inter-sex person.65  Yet, an Australian court has held that a marriage between a biological female and her intersex husband was invalid on the grounds that he was biologically neither male nor female.66  In other cultures, in-tersex people are not permitted to marry at all (see discussion of Pokot Tribe above).    However, in 2008, Australia‟s Human Rights and Equal Opportuni-ty Commission proposed that intersex be recognized as a third gender for use on official documents for people who have not undergone sex as-signment surgery.67  As a result, the validity of an Australian marriage between an intersex individual and a male or female could perhaps be upheld since Australia now recognizes a third gender category.  In March 2010, Australia became the first nation in the world to allow for a “Sex                                                61 U.S. CONST. amend.

Employment U.S. Courts have given the term “sex” its traditional meaning when construing statutes.  In Wood v. C.G. Studios, refusing to construe the statute liberally, the U.S. District Court of Pennsylvania found that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act protects women because of their sta-tus as females and prohibits discrimination against men because of their status as males, but that employers are not legally prohibited from termi-nating employees on the basis of intersex status.70  The court reasoned that other cases involving Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have found that Congress intended the word “sex” to be given its “traditional meaning.” 71  This is the common finding.

As discussed above, intersex has been interpreted, or even con-structed, outside of the confines of American law.  In the cases cited above, one theme emerges—that an intersex individual does not have a recognizable sex that fits neatly into an established classification of male or female.  Therefore, those with intersex status are denied rights that others enjoy and, simultaneously, are subject to discrimination or subject to the idea that they really do not exist legally because they do not fit within one of the binary categories created by the law.   The right \"to define one's own concept of existence\"—the liberty in-terest recognized by the Court in Lawrence v. Texas—is an interest that speaks directly to the efforts of intersex people to gain control over the fate of their sex anatomy from parents, physicians, lawmakers, and socie-ty.81  Some legal scholars have argued that fundamental rights should be granted to those who identify as intersex and that intersex should be le-gally recognized as a sex, like male and female.82   Many states have proposed or adopted resolutions to include legal protection for intersex individuals.  In 2008 the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS)83 unanimously adopted a resolu-tion condemning human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including intersexuality.84  The resolution is noted as the first step in eradicating violence and discrimination; it is believed that the                                                80 See Betsy Driver, Preface to Cardozo Journal of Law and Gender Fall 2005, 12 CARDOZO J.L. & GENDER 1, 1-2 (2005). 81 See generally Chai R.

REV. [Vol.  XXIII::n resolution will lead to changes in law and policy.85 Given the lack of legal protection afforded to intersex individuals in global mainstream society, it is not surprising that there are no laws which address gender verification testing and the intersex individual‟s participation in sports.  Many sports organizations, however, do publish regulations on competition.  These will be explored in the next section.  While it can be argued that gender verification testing is a human rights issue since it infringes on a person‟s right to privacy, the problem with providing protection is, perhaps, twofold.  First, opponents may argue that legal protection is not needed since some people with intersex condi-tions may identify as either male or female, in accordance with the gend-er in which they were raised.  However, there are others who do not iden-tify as strictly male or female and argue that a third option for sex or gender should be available.86   Second, it is not known how many inter-sex individuals actually participate in organized sports—either because the individual may not know of his/her own intersex condition or be-cause the sports organization may not know unless and until gender is  verified.  Nonetheless, it is the law‟s responsibility to protect the intersex athlete‟s right to participate in a sport for which the individual is other-wise qualified.  Additionally, many state anti-discrimination laws only protect people who have undergone surgery, and therefore, do not cover the majority of people in the sex and gender diverse community.87    III.  GENDER VERIFICATION IN SPORTS A. History Gender verification is the process of verifying the eligibility of an athlete to compete in a sporting event that is limited to a single sex.  In ancient Greece, all athletes who participated in the Olympics were male, so it was simple to determine their sex by looking at their unclothed bo-dies.88  Women did not begin participating in competitive sports until                                                85 Id. 86 Sex and Gender Diversity: Report of Initial Consultation, AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, http://www.humanrights.gov.au/genderdiver-sity/consultation_report2008.html (last visited Sept. 26, 2010). 87 Id. 88 Tian Qinjie et al., Gender Verification in Athletes with Disorders of Sex Develop-ment, 25 GYNECOLOGICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY 117, 118 (2009) [hereinafter Gender Verifi-cation]. 16http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 2011] Intersexuality and Gender Verification Tests: The Need to Assure Human Rights and Privacy  231 about the 1920s.89  At the 1936 Berlin Olympics, American gold medalist Helen Stephens was suspected of being a man because of her height and lengthy running strides; as a result, she was subjected to a “sex” test by the International Olympics Committee (IOC).90  Interestingly, the only documented case of a man disguising himself as a woman was at the 1938 Berlin Olympics; the athlete‟s name was Hermann (Dora) Ratjen, and he claimed that he had been persuaded by Nazi officials to pose as a female.91   Due to the increased performance in the 1960s of athletes registered as female, there was a call for sex verification tests in which females were required to strip naked and undergo a visual gynecological exami-nation.92  Another justification for these tests rested on four prior athletes who had competed as women years earlier but who later underwent sex-ual reassignment surgery and became men.93  The first tests (since 1936) were conducted at the European Championships in 1966 and the Pan-American Games in 1967.94  Two Soviet Union Olympic medal winners, Tamara and Irina Press, who had previously set 26 world records be-tween them, disappeared from international sport competition abruptly when gender verification testing became mandatory in 1966.95  Although not confirmed, there was speculation that they were men.96  Only one athlete was banned from sports for failing the sex test—Ewa Klobu-kowska.97  Doctors had determined that Klobukowska was a “mosaic, with some XYY cells, and others containing a single X and nothing else.”98 Because the visual tests were humiliating and degrading, they were abandoned in 1968 and replaced with a genetic test to determine sex                                                89 Arne Ljungqvist et al., The History and Current Policies on Gender Testing in Elite Athletes, 7 INT‟L SPORTMED J. 225, 227 (2006) [hereinafter History]. 90 Alison Carlson, Essay: Suspect Sex, 366 LANCET (MED. & SPORT, SPECIAL ISSUE) S39 (2005).  91 Id. 92 History, supra note 89, at 227. 93 Carlson, supra note 90, at S39 (The athletes were: Czech runner Zdenka Koubko-va who competed in 1934; Lea Caurla and Claire Bressoles, French track medalists at the 1946 European Cup; Erika Schinegger, an Austrian skier). 94 Gender Verification, supra note 88, at 118. 95 Ian O‟Reilly, Gender testing in sport: A case for treatment?, BBC NEWS, Feb. 15, 2010, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8511176.stm. 96 Id. 97 Carlson, supra note 90, at S39. 98 Genetics: Mosaic in X & Y, TIME, (Sept. 29, 1967), http://www.ti-me.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899860,00.html.  17BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 232 PACE INT‟L L.

Furthermore, it has never been proven that those whose biological sex is difficult to ascertain have attributes superior to the genetically typical female. In addition, records of known athletes of unascertainable sex have been surpassed by XX females.101   In the 1980s, the Chairperson of the International Association of Athletics Federations‟ (IAAF) Medical Commission initiated discussions that verification tests not be performed on the grounds that the “rationale for introducing sex controls in the 1960s was no longer pertinent and the procedure discriminated against female athletes with rare genetic disord-ers of sexual differentiation and development.”102  Finally in 1991, the IAAF Council ceased performing gender verification tests.  The Council concluded that  (1) women with congenital sex chromosomal defects do not have an unfair advantage and should be allowed to compete as fe-males, (2) the sole reason of gender verification was to prevent males from disguising themselves as females during competition, (3) chromo-somal make up is not controlling—those who have been recognized as both legally and psychosocially female since childhood should be al-lowed to compete with other females, (4) sex reassignments should be examined on an individual basis, and (5) pre-participation exams should be required for female athletes.103  However, in 1992, the IAAF Council determined “that the medical delegate at a[n IAAF] competition should have the authority to arrange for the determination of the gender of an athlete at his/her discretion.”104  Perhaps this was due to the discovery of the SRY gene (the sex determining region of the Y chromosome).105   Qinjie et al. stated that “it was decided to look at the presence or the absence of SRY in athletes and the presence of SRY would deem an ath-lete a male and an absence of SRY would deem the athlete female.”106  The last time gender verification testing of female athletes was mandato-                                               99 Gender Verification, supra note 88, at 119. 100 Carlson, supra note 90, at S39-S40. 101 Id. at S40. 102 History, supra note 89, at 227. 103 Id. at 229. 104 Id. 105 Gender Verification, supra note 88, at 119. 106 Id. 18http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 2011] Intersexuality and Gender Verification Tests: The Need to Assure Human Rights and Privacy  233 ry was at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia.107  Three-thousand tests were administered, and eight females tested as “male.”108  Seven of the eight were found to have androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), one had an enzyme deficiency, and yet all were allowed to com-pete.109  However, after 1996, even the SRY test had been abandoned by the International Olympic Committee which now conducts gender testing only when there is suspicion that an athlete is competing under an incor-rect classification.110  The IOC also suspended any form of mandatory gender testing in 1999 prior to the 2000 Sydney Games.111  Beginning in 2000, testing will now only take place at the direction of a medical direc-tor of an international sporting event if a complaint has been lodged or a suspicion has arisen.112  The IOC‟s decision was well-received by Yale physician and professor, Myron Genel, who stated that the tests are diffi-cult to perform, have the potential for error, and are discriminatory to-wards women.113  In 2004, the International Volleyball Federation ended gender testing.114  While it should be remembered that gender testing was initially conducted to ensure men were not competing in women‟s sport-ing events, the testing has now become particularly controversial for in-tersex individuals.

There have been allegations that the ASA had begun an investigation into Semenya‟s gender prior to her arrival at the World Championships, but because South Africa, in its role as a newly industrialized country, wanted to get its athletes on the map, ASA ignored what would later become a potential issue for Semenya and allowed her to compete in Berlin anyhow.119  If this is taken as true, then South Africa ostensibly placed its national interests, and ultimate interna-tional fame, before Semenya‟s psychological wellbeing and privacy.  In January 2010, the South African Olympic Committee announced that Semenya is ineligible to run in national and international competitions pending the ruling from its parent organization, IAAF.120  “Semenya‟s lawyer release[d] a statement stating that she [Semenya] has not been disqualified from participating in future athletic meetings, and that „it is clear that our client‟s rights are once again being infringed.‟”121 A November 2009 news report stated that the South African Minis-                                                                                                         which included reports from a gyn[a]ecologist, an endocrinologist, a psychologist, an in-ternal medicine specialist and an expert on gender”). 116 Id.

IAAF is now tight-lipped on any future reports disseminating from it and has ex-pressed regret for the disclosure of Semenya‟s private information.124  The IAAF published the following statement on its official website: The IAAF, the South African Ministry of Sport and Recreation and Caster Semenya‟s representatives have been and still are in discussions with a view to resolving the issues surrounding Caster Semenya‟s participation in Athletics.  The IAAF will not comment upon the medical aspects of Caster Semenya‟s case. The medical testing of the athlete is still to be completed.  There will be no discussion of Caster Semenya‟s case at the forthcoming IAAF Council Meeting to be held in Monaco on 20-21 November 2009. No further comment will be made on this subject until further notice.125 As a result of the above controversy and the initial handling of the situation by IAAF, the South African government filed a complaint with the United Nations on behalf of Semenya, alleging that the gender testing was both sexist and racist.126  Furthermore, the government said it will do all it can to ensure that Semenya‟s rights are protected.127  In addition to filing the complaint with the U.N., the South African government re-quested the resignation of ASA President Leonard Chuene, since he ad-mitted he knew Semenya had undergone a gender test prior to the World Championships.128  The government believes that Chuene did not protect                                                122 Gender-Test Runner Semenya to keep Gold medal, says South Africa, CNN.COM, (Nov. 19, 2009), http://www.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/11/19/athle-tics.semenya.test.gold/index.html. 123 Id. 124 Id. 125 Statement, International Association of Athletics Federations, Caster Semenya, IAAF.ORG (Nov. 18, 2009), http://www.iaaf.org/aboutiaaf/news/-newsid=54923.html. 126 South Africa lodges complaint over Semenya‟s case with UN, THE WEST AUSTRALIAN (Sept. 18, 2009), http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/sport/-a/-/sport/6074416/south-africa-lodges-complaint-over-semenyas-case-with-un/ (last visited Jan. 31, 2010).

Because the alleged discriminatory practices occurred in Berlin, German law is likely to apply if and when any legal action is taken against the IAAF.  Germany‟s Constitution includes a provision which protects every citizen‟s fundamental right to personality—“Article 2(I) of the German Constitution provides everyone with „the right to the free development of his personality insofar as he does not violate the rights of others or offend against the constitutional order or the moral code.‟”130  Germany‟s “right to personality” “protect[s] every person‟s right to dig-nity.”131  Germany‟s model of dignity does not relieve the individual of government intrusion and it states “human dignity requires every citizen to be concerned with the social and moral community.”132  Two “spheres” of human life are protected under Germany‟s personality clause:  “freedom of action and the personal sphere.”133  The personal sphere, relevant here, “contains elements of self-determination and au-tonomy.”134  These elements are closely related to America‟s protection of privacy [and]…address many of the same concerns as America‟s pri-vacy cases.135   In the United States, the constitutional guarantee to privacy136 refers to an individual‟s right to be free from governmental intrusion into one‟s personal affairs,137  whereas, Germany requires all individuals to respect another‟s claims to dignity.138  Clearly, German law is much more ex-pansive than U.S. law.  In fact, the German Constitutional Court has rec-ognized various forms of intersexuality, and it has recognized “an indi-                                               129 Id. 130 Fundamental Rights, supra note 3, at 53 (citing GRUNDGESETZ FUR DIE BUNDESREPUBLIK DEUTSCHLAND [GRUNDGESETZ] [GG] [Basic Law], May 23, 1949, BGBL.

While public knowledge of the testing in-fringed on her privacy, perhaps her situation can be the catalyst for inter-national awareness and change.  Although it has been done at Semenya‟s expense, making intersex visible is fundamental to bringing an end to the discrimination, stigmatization, and even violence surrounding it.  This is particularly necessary in countries like Semenya‟s own South Africa where there are serious “penalties” for gender-nonconformity, including rape and murder.140  For example, in 2008, a South African soccer star, Eudy Simelane, was gang raped and murdered because she was a homo-sexual.141  Additionally, some South Africans deny intersexuality even exists.142  Although the results of the gender verification test were never publicly released by the IAAF (as they should not be), Semenya, if found to be intersex, and all intersex individuals, have a basic right to privacy and gender expression.143 IV.  GENDER-BASED LEGAL PROTECTIONS Efforts to realize gender-based legal protections are integrally con-nected to a nation‟s history, politics, social institutions, and culture.  Many nations are deficient in laws that protect certain minority144 groups from discrimination.  As a “gender” minority, intersex individuals have not been afforded equal protection of anti-discrimination laws.  The United States, for example, has only recently begun to pass legislation in some states that affords homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals.  However, protections for intersex individuals (and also transsexuals)                                                139 Id. (citing DONALD P.

High Commissioner for Human Rights, at a 2008 panel discussion: “[t]hose who are lesbian, gay or bisexual, those who are transgender, transsexual or intersex, are full and equal members of the human family and are entitled to be treated as such,” was made to address nations who still deny human beings their human rights simply because of their per-ceived sexual orientation or gender identity.145  Pallay continued, “[n]o human being should be subject to discrimination, violence, criminal sanctions or abuse simply because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.”146 Interestingly, the “Intersex Initiative,” an organization based in the San Francisco Bay area, and Japan, actually opposes the inclusion of in-tersex in legislation brought on behalf of GLBT activists that prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, or public accommodations.147  The organization believes the GLBT community has a different agenda and advocates separating intersex individuals based on the premise that intersex is a medical condition that can be better protected by strengthen-ing existing disability discrimination laws as opposed to creating new law.148  The organization further states that the inclusion of intersex in anti-discrimination laws “would give the false impression that they have done enough to protect intersex people's rights” when “other serious hu-man rights violations occur in the lives of people born with intersex con-ditions.”149  While the “Intersex Initiative” raises strong points and helps distinguish between intersex and other “gender minorities,” intersex, as a classification, should still be swept into any anti-discrimination law as well. South Africa is a second example of a country that does not afford protection to gender minorities.  Lack of gender-based legislation in South Africa is due in most part to its historical struggle for liberation.  South Africa has struggled against not only gender-based oppression, but also class-based and racial oppression.150  Issues that are particular to                                                145 U.N.

Both the United States and South Africa are similar in that oppres-sion can be found even within and among an oppressed group.  A more effective way to manage and understand these issues is to look at them from a global and humane perspective.  In other words, it is necessary to start thinking about intersexuality from a human-based perspective, not a gender- or sex-based perspective.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides at least a framework to examine the protections that are theoretically provided to every person. Universal human rights are often expressed and guaranteed by law, in the forms of treaties, customary international law, general principles and other sources of international law. International human rights law lays down ob-ligations of Governments to act in certain ways or to refrain from certain acts, in order to promote and protect human rights and fundamental free-doms of individuals or groups.153 Inherent in human beings is the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of “nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status.”154  On December 10, 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proc-laimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to end discrimination for all people. The following Articles of the Declaration are most relevant to the controversy surrounding Semenya and also the lack of protections pro-vided for intersex.  However, they may be subject to their own limita-tions.   Article 1 states:  “All human beings are born free and equal in dig-nity and rights.  They are endowed with reason and conscience and                                                151 Id. at 662 (Stabane is a term used to refer to those born with ambiguous genitalia, but it has also been used as a term of denigration when referring to homosexuals). 152 Id. 153 What Are Human Rights?, UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS, http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Pages/WhatareHumanRights.aspx (last visited Jan. 31, 2010). 154 Id. 25BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 240 PACE INT‟L L.

Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional, or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing, or any other limitation of sovereignty.158   Article 3 states:  “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.”159 Article 29 states:   (1) Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.  (2) In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are de-termined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and re-spect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just require-ments of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.  (3) These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised con-trary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.160 In analyzing these provisions, it is possible that the Declaration could be interpreted two ways:  Articles 2 and 3 protect the individual being.  Therefore, under these Articles, an intersex individual should not be forced to submit to a gender verification test to compete in a sporting event, but Article 29 can be construed as allowing countries leeway in                                                155 Universal Declaration of Human Rights art. 1, G.A.

Thus, it could be argued that gender verification tests affecting intersex individuals is outweighed by the need to protect others‟ rights to fair competition, or to maintain the public or-der, thereby making this issue even more difficult to handle.   V.  BALANCING FAIRNESS IN COMPETITION WHILE ASSURING HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRIVACY IN ORGANIZED SPORTS The previous sections examined the obstacles that exist for intersex individuals and recognized that discrimination of intersex individuals is an international human rights issue.  This section offers strategies for building awareness and tolerance of the participation of intersex individ-uals in sports. However, many of the ideas discussed hereunder may be appropriately extended to areas outside of the sports environment.   In January 2010, a group of international experts of DSD in athletes, organized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), met in Miami, Florida to discuss how to handle female athletes who are discovered to have gender ambiguities.161  Michele Veroken, a leading sports integrity and ethics specialist, noted that gender verification testing is an issue that pertains only to female athletes.162  The experts concluded the follow-ing163: 1.That sport authorities, in conjunction with the relevant medical au-thorities, have a responsibility to follow up on cases of DSD that arise under their jurisdiction; 2.That there be an increase in education and awareness of DSD with-in the sport community; 3.That PPHE (pre participation health examinations) are important for the purpose of identifying athletes with DSD; 4.That precise diagnosis should be established expeditiously utilizing requisite expertise; 5.That a management plan be drawn up if treatment is necessary; 6.That strategically located centers of excellence be established at which athletes with DSD can, if necessary, be diagnosed and treated; and                                                 161 O‟Reilly, supra note 95. 162 Id.  163 Press Release, Int‟l Olympic Comm., Summary of Conclusions Reached at Gend.

The IOC‟s Medical Commission, however, did not say what criteria is used to define female gender, so it is still unclear what exactly the Commission considered to be an ambiguity.164  Veroken says the future of female athletes who are diagnosed with a DSD is uncertain in that the athlete “may have no option but to undergo treatment or even surgery,” and if she does not, she may have to leave the sport.165  Moreover, there is no guarantee that the athlete would be able to compete even after un-dergoing treatment/surgery.166  The IOC is aware that such proposed plans will be scrutinized by the athletes as well as human rights groups.167  While the IOC recognizes the issues surrounding athletes with DSD, and while some at the symposium said that the obligation of IOC is to the “health of the athlete,”168 the IOC‟s conclusions only apply to its affiliated organizations, and, for example, IAAF is not bound by IOC recommendations.  However, the IOC maintains that the purpose of de-veloping the recommendations was to develop more explicit criteria to be used to determine who is eligible for competition.169  The U.S. Golf As-sociation and Great Britain‟s Ladies Golf Union have already adopted IOC‟s guidelines.170   In reaction to the IOC guidelines above, The Coalition for the Inclu-sion of Athletes in Sport (The Coalition) issued a press release “re-quest[ing] that the organizing committee of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games prohibit random gender verification testing of female athletes at the Games, in the best interest of all international female ath-letes.”171  The Coalition does not believe that the IOC has actually elimi-                                               164 O‟Reilly, supra note 95. 165 Id. 166 Id. 167 Id. 168 Id. 169 Arne Ljungqvist & Myron Genel, Transsexual Athletes—When Is Competition Fair?, 366 LANCET (MED. & SPORT, SPECIAL ISSUE) S42 (2005) [hereinafter Competition]. 170 Id. at S43. 171 Press Release, The Coalition of Athletes for Inclusion in Sport, Sport Leaders Request that Random Gender Verification Testing of Female Athletes at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver Be Prohibited (Jan. 25, 2010) http://kristenworley.ca/for-immediate-release-sport-leaders-request-that-random-gender-verification-testing-of-female-athletes-at-the-2010-winter-olympic-games-in-vancouver-be-prohibited/ (last vi-sited Jan. 16, 2011) [hereinafter Vancouver]. 28http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 2011] Intersexuality and Gender Verification Tests: The Need to Assure Human Rights and Privacy  243 nated any discriminatory impact on gender testing with its newly pub-lished guidelines.172  For the following reasons, The Coalition alleges that the IOC‟s guidelines represent a “violation of international laws173 prohibiting gender discrimination and the IOC‟s own commitment to equality and the right to play”174: 1.By classifying gender ambiguities as disorders requiring treatment, the IOC is pathologizing a normal spectrum of humanity. 2.By assuming that the only relevant gender issue is in women‟s events, the IOC ignores the potential advantage of physical cha-racteristics associated with the female form to men in certain sports. 3.By not stating what criteria are relevant to a determination of “male” or “female,” the IOC policy is excessively discretionary and subjective. 4.By subjecting only certain women to the policy, the IOC also leaves women open to witch hunts and requests to undergo body modification. The Coalition envisions “a sport system that is open to all people, at all levels of participation, recognizing in particular those previously ex-cluded because of the narrow definition of what is assumed normal hu-man development.”175  In addition to requesting the IOC abandon gender verification testing altogether, The Coalition has also asked that the IOC work with international and national sport governing bodies as well as athletes who have been discriminated against, vis-à-vis IOC policies, in an effort to develop policies that are based on current research and reflec-tive of basic human rights.  Further, The Coalition has published a “Posi-tion Statement” on “the guiding principles for inclusion in sport,”176 which it continues to urge the IOC to adopt.177                                                  172 Id. 173 Id.

The Coalition states facts about gender including that (1) sport is typically organized by gender, (2) gender is individual and is “sociological, biological, and phy-siological,” and (3) gender is fluid in both females and males.180  The “facts” should be amended to include the following:  (1) sport is also or-ganized by sex (there is a distinct difference between the terms sex and gender)181, (2) gender also includes psychological and cultural aspects of one‟s development, and (3) gender should be examined on a continuum. The Coalition raises important issues for discussion.  Most impor-tantly is whether “gender is [even] a relevant classification in sport.”182  If it is, The Coalition argues, then a fair system of gender determination needs to be developed.183  If it is not, The Coalition argues, then women are just objectified in sport if it is found that gender classification is built on “assumptions of male advantage.”184  A secondary issue makes the as-sumption that gender is a classification and will likely be used in orga-nizing sport, but that it must be accepted that gender is a social construct and not a scientific construct.185  The Coalition addresses the above issues through a series of rec-ommendations:186 1.Replace gender testing with individual athlete profiles (for men and women), and include a measure for androgen levels.                                                178 Position Statement, supra note 176. 179 Id. at 1. 180 Id. 181 See MERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sex (last visited Sep. 20, 2010) (defining “sex” as “either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished re-spectively as female or male especially on the basis of their reproductive organs and structures”); MERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gender (last visited Sep. 20, 2010) (defining “gender” as “the be-havioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex”) (last visited Sep. 20, 2010). 182 Position Statement, supra note 176, at 1. 183 Id at 2. 184 Id. 185 Id. 186 Id. 30http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 2011] Intersexuality and Gender Verification Tests: The Need to Assure Human Rights and Privacy  245 2.Accommodate different body types using the Therapeutic Use Ex-emption model.187 3.Require International Sport Federations to determine their own classifications (i.e. weight, height, other physical differentia-tions) and keep a profile on each athlete.

Although the Con-vention reminds members to compel universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction to sex, inter alia, Article 1(g) clearly defines “sportsmen” as “men” and “women” who participate in sports activities.194  The inherent limitation, however, is that member states can object to certain articles of a treaty so that the treaty does not infringe on the individual state‟s existing law.  Since it is likely that member states will interpret the terms in their traditional sense unless an amendment is passed, intersex individuals will continue to escape the protections of international treaties.  The U.S. Constitution reflects this inherent limitation.  First, al-though an individual‟s right to bodily integrity is already a well-recognized fundamental right,195 the problem with recognizing intersex as a legal classification is that it is virtually a concealed status unless a person self-discloses.   An individual‟s interest in protecting his/her bodi-ly integrity in areas of procreation and medical treatment have been found to outweigh the state‟s interest in regulating an individual‟s health care decisions.196  Therefore, an intersex individual would only enjoy the protection if the individual revealed his/her condition.  Second, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution explicitly protects an individual‟s right to self-expression.  Although it could be argued that the First Amendment protects the intersex condition if it is viewed as a form of self-expression,197 to the extent that it can be agreed that intersexuality is a generally inconspicuous condition involving genitalia and chromosom-al make up, most intersex individuals “would not be protected by the First Amendment because they would not be seen as expressing any                                                                                                          of a Public Hearing, THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, 8 (Apr. 25, 2005) http://www.isna.org/files/SFHRC_Intersex_Report.pdf . 193 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 3, 999 U.N.T.S. 171 (Dec. 16, 1966), available at http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/-1976/03/19760323%2006-17%20AM/Ch_IV_4p.pdf. 194 International Convention against Apartheid in Sports art. 1(g), 1500 U.N.T.S. 161 (Dec. 10 1985), available at http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treat-ies/1988/04/19880403%2003-09%20AM/Ch_IV_10p.pdf 195 Fundamental Rights, supra note 3, at 43. 196 Id. at 43-44. 197 Id. at 51. 32http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6BOUND EDITION- LARSON (DO NOT DELETE) 6/6/2011  7:07 PM 2011] Intersexuality and Gender Verification Tests: The Need to Assure Human Rights and Privacy  247 message.”198  As noted above, gender verification tests were the subject of con-troversy since their implementation.199   Even if an individual state‟s law does not allow for a recognized status of intersex, intersex individuals should still be allowed to compete with his/her chosen sex group.  How-ever, given the discrepancies between and among national and interna-tional law, the inclusion of intersex individuals in sports may be best handled by the sports associations.  As Carlson noted, genetic screening was “simply discriminatory” since women born with chromosome irre-gularities actually possess “no unfair, male-like physical advantages that XX [females] . . . cannot have as a matter of other forms of biological variation.”200  The IOC agrees that every athlete is genetically different and cites examples of athletes “who compete at elite level[s] [and who] will already have exploited some genetic advantage to be in that position . . . with years of training.”201  This, of course, raises the question as to what extent a gender ambiguity is just another genetic advantage.  To eliminate an unfair advantage and ensure equitable competition, athletic associations should use factors such as age, weight, height, arm span, and muscle mass, for example, to place athletes into classes since these fac-tors are objectively measurable.  Having an objective classification sys-tem that is sport-specific will enable athletes to compete with other ath-letes who have similar characteristics.  A subjective measurement such as sex or gender should not be used even though exposure to male hor-mones has actually not been found to provide a competitive advantage.202 VII.  CONCLUSION Sex as a classification is much more complex than male or female.  The discussion on respect and tolerance towards individuals with DSDs must continue around the globe.  In discussing the issues on a global scale, biological, psychological, sociological, anthropological, legal, and cultural factors must be considered.  The medical profession must regu-                                               198 Id. (citing City of Cincinnati v.

REV. [Vol.  XXIII::n larly provide up-to-date information and findings on biological and med-ical issues for individuals to make responsible decisions in their personal lives—whether to remain intersex or undergo assignment surgery.  The international psychological and psychiatric communities will hopefully have a more refined and universal definition of intersex when the DSM-V is published in 2012.  Individuals within various social institutions and cultures need to be more accepting of individual differences and open to the possibility of eliminating the gender binary.  The laws, both national-ly and internationally, need to provide greater protections to all humans as a matter of preserving human integrity and dignity.   Because the earth is now a multi-cultural planet of migration, trans-cultural considerations are necessary.  Although there are only a handful of intersex organizations around the world and although they may have initially been formed to tackle the medical of aspect of the intersex con-dition, they also educate and campaign on behalf of intersex individu-als.203  Furthermore, two organizations in South Africa are building awareness of intersexuality and using Semenya‟s case as a catalyst.  Gender DynamiX and Intersex South Africa suggest that post-apartheid South Africa has strategic space within its ANC‟s Freedom Charter and Bill of Rights to end oppression and discrimination of the intersex, inter alia.204  Both organizations argue that intersex rights have been inconsis-tently applied, but with the publicity of Semenya, South Africans are now being educated that it is not just Semenya who was affected, but that the lack of human rights available for this and other groups, touches all, and as a result, cultural norms need to change.205                                                   203 See Questions and Answers About UKIA, THE UK INTERSEX ASSOCIATION, http://www.ukia.co.uk/about.htm (last visited Sep. 21, 2010); INTERSEX SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA (ISOZ), http://home.vicnet.net.au/~inter-sex/index.htm (last visited Sep. 21, 2010). 204 Intersex Activism, supra note 126, at 661. 205 Id. at 662. 34http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol23/iss1/6",
