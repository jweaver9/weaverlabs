This legal\nmeasure was the end point of a long lobbying and advocacy strategy\nimplemented by activists and organisations working on gender and sexual\ndiversity. This Working Paper presents that experience as part of the process in\nwhich subordinated social sectors, such as gender diverse and sexually\ndiverse people make themselves political subjects. In spite of the novelty in\nColombia and in Latin America of this kind of public policy targeting LGBT\npeople as subjects of rights, it is also an opportunity for normative systems to\nreadjust and to create new ways to normalise people. The promotion of certain\nqueer people as proper citizens, the regulation of ways to interact with the\nstate, the co-option of social mobilisations and the transformation of grassroots\norganisations into private service providers, are just some of the risks that a\nscheme like this faces. The author was part of the social mobilisation that\nmotivated this particular public policy scheme in the early 2000s and was\ninvolved in its design, planning and initial implementation between 2007 and\n2010. This paper is situated in a problematic position between political\nactivism, consultancy work and construction of knowledge based on the\npractice. It is a contribution to the memory of a rich, and in many ways unique,\nexperience.\nKeywords: heteronormativity; Colombia; public policies; sexual rights; homo-\nsexuality; transgender.\n04\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\nJosé Fernando Serrano Amaya.

Associated with risk and danger,\nbut hardly ever with pleasure or love, sex has been treated by development\nagencies as something to be controlled and contained. The AIDS epidemic has\nbroken old taboos and silences, and has begun to open up space for the\nrecognition of how central sexual rights are to everyone’s wellbeing. But more\nis needed to take us beyond the confines of narrow problem-focused thinking\nabout sexuality towards approaches in which pleasure and desire play as large\na part as danger and death do today.\nSexuality is a vital aspect of development. It affects people’s livelihoods and\nsecurity, their wellbeing, and sometimes their very survival. Sexual rights are a\nprecondition for reproductive rights and for gender equality. Lack of sexual\nrights affects heterosexual majorities as well as sexual minorities – lesbians\nand gay men, bisexuals, transgendered and intersex people – who are so often\ndenied basic human rights and subjected to violence and exclusion. In some\ncountries, women are denied a choice of partner, subjected to coercive marital\nsex and restricted in their mobility. Pervasive homophobia places those married\nmen who desire other men, their male partners and their wives at greater risk\nof HIV and AIDS. Adolescents schooled into abstinence learn little about their\nbodies or their desires, and may be more vulnerable to unwanted pregnancy\nand sexually transmitted infections as a result. And sex workers are routinely\ndenied basic legal and employment – as well as broader human – rights. Rare\nis the environment which allows people to live out a fulfilling and pleasurable\nsexuality of their choice, and that empowers people with a sense of their right\nto say ‘yes’ as well as ‘no’ and enjoy safe, loving relationships free from\ncoercion and violence.\nIssues of sex and sexuality are all too often associated with silence, shame\nand stigma. Solutions that are framed by a discourse that problematises sex\noffer limited scope for transforming the way in which development actors work\non these issues. It is all too easy to focus on the negatives that we highlight\nabove and to conspire with a silence within them about unruly desires, about\npleasuring the senses, and about love. The turn to rights in international\ndevelopment discourse may offer new openings for the articulation of sexuality\nand development, and new opportunities for realising sexual rights. This series\nof working papers and practice papers enters the debate about sexual rights\nfrom the perspective of development. Together, the papers seek to challenge\northodoxies and bring fresh thinking to the challenges of making sexual rights\nreal. With thanks to DFID for funding this paper.\nSusie Jolly and Kate Hawkins\nSexuality and Development Programme, IDS\n07\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\nIntroduction\nOn 28 December 2007 the then Mayor of Bogotá, Luis Eduardo Garzón, signed\nDecree 608 which established the guidelines of the public policy for the full\nguarantee of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)\npeople in the city. On 1 April 2009 the City Council was made responsible for\nthe development of that measure, giving it more sustainability and status in the\nlegal hierarchy (Acuerdo no. 371 de 2009). This legal measure was the ending\npoint of a long lobby and advocacy strategy implemented by activists and\norganisations working on gender and sexual diversity. It was also the starting\npoint of another moment in the city and in the country for the realisation of\nsexual rights.\nIn this working paper I will present that experience as part of the process in\nwhich subordinated social sectors, such as gender diverse and sexually\ndiverse people make themselves political subjects. In the interactions between\nlanguages of rights and citizenship (Molyneaux and Craske 2002: 1) gender\nand sexual minorities in Colombia have claimed the creation and imple-\nmentation of public policy schemes as a strategy to promote social, cultural\nand political change. It has also been the way to develop legal advances\nformulated at the level of superior courts that are not yet implemented into\neveryday experiences of LGBT people and communities. It is not coincidental\nthat the case is situated in a specific city: in Colombia, as in other countries,\nlocal spaces can promote changes that are not easy to develop at the national\nlevel.1 The particular policy I will explore here is also part of a broader context\nof consolidation of democracy, developing of spaces for participation and\ndeepening of citizenship. It is also a chance to read how Colombian state and\nlocal institutions deal with differences. Because of that, this policy is a ‘hybrid\nspace’ (Cornwall and Coelho 2007: 1), since it is situated in the middle of\nchanges, negotiations and interchanges of relations between state and society.\nHybrid spaces are provided by public institutions and supported in legal frames\nwhile simultaneously being a conquest of organised civil society actors (ibid.).\nIn spite of the novelty in Colombia of this kind of public policy targeting LGBT\npeople as subjects of rights, they are also an opportunity for normative systems\nto readjust and to create new ways to normalise people. The promotion of\ncertain queer people as proper citizens, the regulation of ways to interact with\n1 For examples of advances at local and state level in relation to LGBT topics in the USA, see: Padilla\n(2004). For the UK, see: Monro (2005). In the case of the USA, Vaid (2004: xxiii) considers that\nconservatives are dominant at the national level and have stymied effort to make gains in the\nCongress. Meanwhile, the high degree of authority at state level has created opportunities for sub-\nnational actions in social policies (ibid.). In the case of the UK, sexual orientation equality work has\nbeen done in progressive local authorities but faced various conservative backslashes in the form of\nright-wing national policies (Monro 2005: 75). In Colombia the Constitutional Court has developed\nseveral protective measures for gender and sexual minorities but the Senate has not made any\nadvance in the field, defeating progressive measures on several occasions. Advances at city level\nsuch as in the case of Bogotá, Medellín or Cali, have been achieved by left-wing or centre-oriented\ngovernments.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n08\nthe state, the co-option of social mobilisations and the transformation of\ngrassroots organisations into private service providers, are just some of the\nrisks that a scheme like this is facing.\nTo develop this argument this working paper is divided in four parts:\n\u0002 In the first part I will briefly discuss the relationship between public policies\nand heteronormativity\n\u0002 In the second part I will provide a description of the Latin American and\nColombian context in relation to gender and sexual minority rights\n\u0002 In the third part I will describe how the public policy scheme I analysed\nwas created and structured, basically to show how topics of rights, gender\nidentity and sexual orientation become a topic for public policies\n\u0002 In the fourth part, I will present several paradoxes of this public policy\nscheme, since it challenges previous actions toward gender and sexual\nminorities but risks creating a new normative order\n\u0002 In the conclusions I will recall the main arguments of the paper and I will\npresent some reflections for practices.\nI write this paper after being at the same time an insider and an outsider of the\nexperience. I was part of the social mobilisation that motivated this particular\npublic policy scheme in the early 2000s and then I was involved in its design,\nplanning and initial implementation between 2007 and 2010. These conditions\nof outsiderness and insiderness are not fixed or static positions but fluid,\npermeable and ever-shifting social locations in which I have positioned myself\nin different moments. The description I will make is situated in a problematic\nposition between political activism, consultancy work and construction of\nknowledge based on the practice. I will base this paper on my notes and the\ndocuments I produced through those four years. This paper is not an\nassessment of the policy scheme concerned, nor does it reflect the perspective\nof the institutions I have worked for. It is more a contribution to the memory of\nthe process and a way to promote reflection in such a rich, and in many ways\nunique, experience.\n1 Public policies and the production\nand reproduction of hetero-\nnormativity\nIn Spanish the term política includes three concepts that in English are\ncomplementary but separated: politics, polity and policy. Políticas públicas are\nusually associated with the policies generated from, by or with the State or\ngovernment to interact with citizens (Muller 2010: 39). They imply the role of\npublic institutions (polity) to mobilise the field of power relations (politics).\nPublic policy analysis was originated in the United States and in Anglophone\n09\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\ncontexts with quite particular characteristics not extensively lived in Latin\nAmerica: relatively stable democratic contexts; several organisations\nindependent from government; institutions with capacities to interact with\ncitizens; entities defending and promoting governance and accountability\n(ibid. 41). In spite of the problems to define what a ‘welfare state’ is and how it\naffects public and social policies in Europe, most Latin-American countries are\nfar from having experienced it.\nMore than linguistic matters, behind the terms are basic differences in the way\ncitizenship, democracies and state-civil society relations are developed which\nmake difficult to identify what is precisely a public policy. Public policies are\nways in which societies construct certain issues as objects of attention to be\npositioned in public agendas. Through this attention, State and institutions\nregulate different aspects of society, such as social struggles, social needs or\ndifferences. In the case of Colombia, and maybe other Latin American\ncountries, the lack of actions by the State to challenge homophobia or\ntransphobia can be seen as an implicit public policy based on the idea of not\nacting because the issue is not really important. The formulation of explicit\nschemes of public policy can have several contradictory meanings, as has\nbeen studied in the case of urban policies: in order to ameliorate certain\nproblems, social divisions can be stressed. In this way, public policies are not\njust a fact but an object constructed by the analysis (Muller 2010: 69).\nIn Colombia, legal frames, especially when they are formulated at the level of\nsuperior courts, are not always developed into action plans, budgets,\nprogrammes and specific measures to apply them to citizens’ everyday\npractices. Several legal advances, based on important political debates, do not\nhave the adequate policy and polity conditions to be applied, becoming just\nimportant written words. As Spiller, Stein and Tommasi (2008) study, the\nproblem of public policies in Latin America lies less inside the policies\nthemselves than in the policymaking process behind them. It is in poor quality\nof implementation and enforcement where most policies in Latin America fail\n(ibid.: 12). As an example, in a long term analysis of human rights public\npolicies in Colombia Roth (2006) finds that the paradigm of rights underlying\nthe 1991 Constitution lack the commitment of important political sectors to\ndefine and implement adequate public policies. Part of the problem was not\nonly at the conceptual level with the reduction of the human rights field to the\narmed conflict and the consideration of broader approaches to human rights as\nsubversive (ibid. 116); the problem of those policies has also been the slow\ndevelopment of general laws and a lack of institutional and financial resources\n(ibid. 156–7).\nIn a context of fragmentation, short-term horizons in political transactions and\nlack of effectiveness in public policies led by state agents to promote change\n(Cárdenas, Junguito and Pachón 2008), LGBT organisations, activists and\npersons in Colombia have developed a wide variety of strategies to achieve\nsocial transformations. These strategies include parades, marches, sit-ins, kiss-\nins, drag performances, beauty contests, among others. Looking for change\nthrough interacting with state agents or using litigation was a strategy\nconsidered suspicious by some of the pioneers of the Colombian homosexual\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n10\nmovement (Zuleta 1996). For them, the very nature of the State was the cause\nof heterosexism and legal changes did not lead directly to the cultural changes\nrequired to transform discrimination. However, litigation seems to be one of the\nmain strategies for LGBT organisations in Bogota and nationally all through the\n2000s.\nHere it is important to make a difference between approaches to policies and\nlaw making by lawyers, political sciences analysts or public sector managers\nand those of social actors, activists or civil society organisations.2 Taking an\n‘actor oriented approach’ (Nyamu-Musembi 2005), Rights are defined by\nstruggles born of experiences of deprivation and oppression. In this way, it is\nnot just the legal or political content itself that matters but the history and\nrepresentations of resistance, struggle and gain that social actors attach to\nthem. In this case study, campaigning for the creation of public policies has\nbeen a strategy advanced by LGBT organisations and activists in Bogotá in\norder to promote social change and to deploy legal developments into\neveryday practices. It is also a particular way in which social movements\ninteract with public institutions in order to promote change. This in the middle\nof the tensions and challenges generated by a context where participatory\ndemocracy is still in development and where there is a long history of\nprosecution of civil society initiatives. The existence of legal frames, even if\nthey are not implemented, can be a chance for social movements to\nrenegotiate their relationship with the State, as I will present in this working\npaper. Even with all the controlling and normalising risks that public policies\ncan have, their existence is an opportunity to demand that the State and its\ninstitutions assume their responsibility to respond to unattended situations,\nobey their duties or act about their omissions.\nWhat is not always clear in the political field of struggles for social change and\nequity is that public and social policies can also be forms in which\nheteronormative regimes and heterosexism are produced and reproduced in\nsocieties (Chambers 2007). Heteronormativity is the institutionalisation of a\nnormative system that privileges heterosexuality as a social order. Because it\nis not just the exclusion of gender or sexual diverse people, it also affects\nheterosexual people. In its intersections with gender dichotomy (Jackson 2005)\nheteronormativity privileges a kind of coupling (monogamous heterosexual)\nand gives it a full regime of rights, and regulates life cycles and sexualities.\nBecause it privileges heterosexuality, heteronormativity governs gender\nrelations between men and women and orders divisions of labour and\nresources (ibid.). If citizenship is based on the gender order of masculine\nprivilege, as feminist literature has argued extensively, citizenship is also\nheteronormative. That is why an important part of the struggles promoted by\ngender and sexual minorities are directed towards granting the basic standards\nof citizenship. However, the granting of rights to same-sex couples does not\nimply a direct challenge to heteronormativity because it still creates divisions\n2 This division is not permanent because in several cases lawyers are also activists involved in social\nmovements. For an example of the connection between activism and law development see: Azuero\nand Albarracín (2009).\n11\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\nand hierarchies based on a certain normative system (i.e. marriage). Further,\nas Sharma (2007: 109) mentions, the language of rights associated with non-\nheterosexual sexuality struggles tends to be limited to the respect of individual\noptions or to denouncing violations, blurring the comprehension of compulsory\nheterosexuality and wider normative orders. The language of rights does not\ndirectly break down heteronormativity (ibid.).\nAccording to this approach, heteronormativity is intrinsic in politics, policies and\npolities. For example, the way in which social services are delivered in areas\nsuch as health or housing, implies a heteronormative model of gender and\nsexuality. Education implicitly has not only a reproductive approach to sexuality\nbut also a heterosexual and gender dichotomist model. Despite important\nadvances in order to challenge the ‘gender blindness’ in social policies, the\nconstruction of ‘women’ and ‘men’ in social policies tends to see them as\nseparate and discrete categories, overlooking gender diversity (Monro 2005).\nFurther, when sexual orientation is included in public policies there is a\ntendency to focus on gay men and lesbian women, blurring the specificity of\nbisexual people or including gender diverse people in actions focused on\naddressing sexual orientation needs (ibid.). These conflicts have been\npresented all through the design of the case study I will present here and are a\ntopic of constant debate on LGBT movements in the city.\nWhat I will present now are several examples of the paradoxes presented in\nthe design and first implementation of the public policy scheme for LGBT\npeople in Bogotá, as a way to reflect based on practice on the possibilities and\nlimits that public policies have in the promotion of change.\n2 Context and overview of LGBT\nrights in the region and in the\ncountry\nTo understand the current gains in terms of rights associated with sexual and\ngender diversity in Latin America is to understand a history of social struggles.\nAll through the 1980s, after the ending of authoritarian governments, the Latin\nAmerican region lived different processes of democratisation led by civil society\nactors and social movements (Dagnino 2005). A wide variety of social agents\nsuch as indigenous communities, people of African descent, women, workers,\npeasants and youth, broadened political spaces using citizenship as an\narticulating point for collective actions. Women´s movements played an\nimportant role in the developing of the ‘right to have rights’ as part of the\ndeepening of democracy and the claims for social justice (Molyneux and\nCraske 2002) and applied that idea to a wide variety of topics including political\nparticipation, work or sexual and reproductive rights. They and Latin American\nfeminists have criticised the liberal, individualist and utilitarian notion of\ncitizenship and have developed a more participatory, active and socially\nresponsible approach to it (Molyneux 2003).\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n12\nThis particular language of rights, citizenship and democracy was incorporated\nalso in the social mobilisations for gender and sexual diversity which started in\nthe region in the 1970s (Brown 2002). Mottos such as ‘Freedom to express\none’s sexuality is a human right’ used in Argentina (Brown 2002) or ‘Los\nderechos humanos también son sexuales, los derechos sexuales también son\nhumanos [human rights are sexual rights, sexual rights are human rights]’ in\nColombia (Velandia 1998), entered in the political agendas of lesbian, gay,\nbisexual and transgender movements. In the 1980s in several Latin American\ncountries the social reaction to the HIV-AIDS phenomenon nurtured the\norganisation and development of new homosexual identities and communities\n(Parker 2000). In this context, the work of activists, academics and educators\ncreated several connections between the AIDS issue and international\ndiscussions around sexual rights and human rights (Londoño 1996; Velandia\n1998). Even more, it was the occasion for these mobilisations to enter into\ndialogues with state agents and public institutions in order to demand actions\nand policies to attack the pandemic. This work and the participation of lesbians\nin women´s and feminist movements can be seen as part of the foundations of\nfurther social and political actions in topics of gender and sexual diversity.\nCurrently, Latin America experiences a broad spectrum of legal regimes in\nrelation to gender and sexual diversity which can be classified considering their\ndegree of protection (Rios 2006). Most of the countries experience a minimum\ndegree of protection, since homosexuality is no longer prosecuted, with the\nexception of Belize and Surinam. Several countries have an intermediate\ndegree of protection with the inclusion of antidiscrimination measures in\ndifferent legal bodies. In some cases, a greater degree of protection is\nestablished with positive measures. For example, Mexico, Venezuela,\nColombia, Ecuador and Bolivia have protective measures for sexual\norientation. Uruguay and Colombia have recently approved the recognition of\nrights for same sex couples. In 2010, Mexico City and Argentina sanctioned\nsame sex marriage.\nLegal and political advances and social mobilisations for gender and sexual\ndiversity in Latin America have also gained regional and international influence.\nIn 2003 Brazil promoted in the United Nations Human Rights Commission a\nresolution for the inclusion of sexual orientation as part of international human\nrights agendas. In June 2008 the 38th Regular Session of the Organization of\nAmerican States adopted a resolution that recognised the violation of rights\nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity and asked member countries\nto develop actions to prevent and address the situation. The topic has been\nmentioned again in the 39th and 40th Sessions.\nThe existence of these legal frameworks has promoted in some countries the\ndevelopment of public policies, programmes and social services targeting\nlesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. One example of national public\npolicies is the programme ‘Brazil without Homophobia’ implemented since\n2004. This national public policy proposes several antidiscrimination initiatives\nand the promotion of rights related with non violence, education, health, work\nand culture for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. At the local level\nthere is also a diverse landscape of initiatives promoted by local governments\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n13\nwhich have included educational campaigns, delivery of social services and\ncommunity centres for lesbian, gay or transgender people.\nAs I said before, one aspect seems to be constant in the above mentioned\nlegal and policy advances: they are the result of the lobbying, demands and\norganisation of diverse groups at the regional, national or local level because\nof the invisibility and lack of attention by state actors to discrimination and hate\ncrimes based on gender or sexual orientation. It is the accumulated experience\nand expertise developed by LGBT organisations that underlies and nurtures\nthose initiatives and the realisation of rights. For example, in the case of the\nNational Campaign Against Discrimination in México, it resulted from the\nprevious work of LGBT activists in HIV-AIDS who positioned homophobia as\nthe main cause of infections and demanded of state authorities the\nimplementation of actions to reduce discrimination based on sexual orientation\n(Lyra 2008). Similarly, the experience acquired by lesbian and bisexual women\nin feminism, the women´s movement and in gender equity policies seems to\nframe theoretically and empirically several initiatives around LGBT rights, such\nas in the case of Bogotá. The experience of coordinated action against abuse\nby police and the lack of attention of social services providers to the needs of\nsexual workers appear also as part of the background for the initiatives\ndeveloped by transgender women or travesties, as can be seen in Argentina\n(Berkins and Fernández 2005).\nThe above description of legal and policy advances should not lead to a\nconclusion that the rights of transgender, intersex, lesbian, bisexual or gay\npeople are fully guaranteed or protected by states in the region. Besides, the\nadvances in relation to sexual orientation and same sex couples’ rights are not\nmatched by gender diversity rights, which are still underdeveloped. National\nlawmakers are still reluctant to include medical procedures related with gender\nidentity in the public health systems. In some Brazilian cities such as Sao\nPaulo local governments provide medical treatment to transgender persons in\npublic hospitals as part of their delivery of health services, while specific\nservices for travesties and transgender women sexual workers are just starting\nto be implemented in Buenos Aires or Rosario in Argentina. However, these\ncases are the exception.\n2.1 Colombian general context\nLegislation and public policies related to gender and sexual diversity in\nColombia need to be understood in the contradictory social and political\nsituations lived in that country. Colombia is considered one of the oldest\ndemocracies of Latin America, since the country did not face the kind of\nauthoritarian governments experienced in the south of the region. However,\nColombia has the second highest level of wealth concentration in Latin\nAmerica, causing important effects in poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion\n(Delgado 2003). Colombia has suffered the most protracted conflict in the area,\nwith important effects in all aspects of society. In the struggles of left-wing\nguerrilla groups with State forces and right-wing paramilitaries, the country\nfaces one of the gravest humanitarian crises in the world. Some sources\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n14\nconsider that between 1985 and 2008 around 4.630.000 Colombians were\nforcibly internally displaced, with almost 3 million just in the period 1997–March\n2009 (Codhes 2009). The fact that just 20 per cent of violent deaths can be\nassociated with the socio-political conflict has made evident the presence of\nother types of violence in everyday life, such as urban violence, delinquency,\ngender based violence and the use of armed means to solve interpersonal\nconflicts (Camacho 2001).\nThe reactions to the socio-political conflict have affected political cultures,\ndemocracy and the trends of social mobilisation for social justice and rights. In\n1958, in an arrangement that endured until 1974, the two traditional political\nparties, Liberal and Conservador, agreed to share political power and alternate\nin the Presidency, leading to the exclusion of other political options. As result of\nthis, alternative social movements faced repression and annihilation, which\nbecame a long-term pattern in Colombian political culture (Moncayo 2001).\nHowever, at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, the development\nof civil society mobilisations made them a more recognised actor in the political\nsphere. After the demobilisation of some guerrilla groups in the late 1980s, the\nfollowing decade began with a popular campaign for a new national constitution\nled by a student´s initiative. The 1991 Constitution was organised around the\nnegotiation of a new social pact based on the State as a guarantor of rights,\nthe opening of political spaces for new social expressions of citizenship, the\nlowering of barriers for political participation, regional autonomy and\nadministrative independence (Cárdenas, Junguito and Pachón 2008: 240). Also\nideas of multiculturalism and diversity were incorporated in the new definition\nof nationality. Among several legal changes, the 1991 Constitution developed a\nprotective measure called Tutela that started to be used by individuals to claim\na whole variety of rights related to the free development of personality, non\ndiscrimination and equity. Academics and activists have opined that it was\nbecause of this new Constitution that matters of gender and sexual diversity\nexperienced the kind of progressive trends seen in contemporary Colombia\n(Lemaitre 2009; Bonilla 2006).\nFollowing the regional trend mentioned before, it has been because of the\nactivism of individuals and social organisations in denouncing human rights\nviolations that the Colombian State developed some measures against\ndiscrimination based on gender diversity or sexual orientation. The human\nrights situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people in Colombia has\nbeen of particular concern to national and international human rights\norganisations, LGBT activists and research centres, at least since the second\npart of 1990s. Permanent reports have been produced to denounce the\nsituation. The violations mentioned cover a wide range of situations:\n\u0002 LGBT people have been victims of homicides and extrajudicial killings\nwhich have not been properly investigated.3\n3 In 1996 Juan Pablo Ordoñez, a Colombian lawyer, published the pioneer report No Human Being is\nDisposable, a joint work of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, the\nColombian Human Rights Committee (Washington DC) and Proyecto Dignidad, about social\ncleansings squads in Colombia.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n15\n4 Constitutional Court, Sentence T-594 of 1993 and T-504 of 1994\n\u0002 Arbitrary detentions, cruel degradations and inhuman treatments committed\nby police members against LGBT persons have been denounced but not\npenalised, maintaining mistrust regarding legal mechanisms to protect\ncitizens (Colombia Diversa 2008).\n\u0002 LGBT people in the areas affected by conflict and humanitarian crisis have\nbeen threatened, displaced and killed (ibid.).\n\u0002 There are also cases of LGBT persons who have had to look for political\nasylum in foreign countries because of reasons related to their sexual\norientation, gender identity or activist work (ibid.). LGBT people have poor\ninformation about their rights and the mechanisms they can use to realise\nthem. The perception that some transgender or non heterosexual people\nhave regarding their rights is still affected by discrimination legitimised and\nreproduced in cultural practices and institutions.\n\u0002 LGBT people are afraid to denounce situations of abuse because of the\nrisk of a double victimisation: one caused by the abuse itself and the other\nbecause of the discriminatory treatment and the negative attention drawn\nto their gender identity or their sexual orientation by authorities.\n\u0002 The expression of gender identity by transgender and transsexual persons\nexposes them to systematic patterns of discrimination and exclusion,\ncoming from their families, schools, and work environments, among others.\nA constant in this situation is the lack of proper public policies to intervene at\nthe level of prevention, attention or compensation for victims; the invisibility of\nlesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people in institutional attention systems;\nand the prejudicial practices in public institutions, all the above reflecting the\nexistence of institutionalised homophobia and heterosexist practices. By action\nor by omission state agents and agencies impede the realisation of right of non\nheterosexual people or of those who do not conform to gender norms. Activists\nand LGBT organisations have denounced the way in which institutions impose\nheteronormative logics in the delivery of social services.\nIn this situation, significant progresses have been obtained in terms of LGBT\nrights (Azuero and Albarracín 2009). On 28 January 2009, for example, the\nColombian Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples must be granted\nthe same rights as unmarried heterosexual couples. This new ruling included\ncivil, economic, political, social, immigration and criminal law rights for same-\nsex couples and followed other judgments delivered in the previous two years\nin relation to health and social security, inheritance and survival pensions. With\nrespect to gender identity, transsexual and transgender persons in Colombia\ncan change the names they were given at birth by presenting a request to a\njudge. They can also change the sex that appears on their identity card, once\nthey have had sexual reassignment surgery.4 In relation to intersex children,\nthe Constitutional Court in several sentences 5 has considered the need of\ninformed agreement before surgical procedures, the limits of parents’\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n16\ndecisions, the autonomy of intersex persons and their right to decide about\ntheir bodies, and has even questioned surgeries as a possible discriminatory\nmeasure against intersex persons. It has also stated that the dignity of the\nperson requires the specific medical and psychological needs of intersex\npersons to be included in the social security systems. This position of the\nColombian Constitutional Court has been considered very progressive in the\nLatin American context by intersex and LGBT activists (Holmes 2006).\nHowever, legal advances in Colombia have occurred at the level of the superior\ncourts, particularly in the Constitutional Court and after the enactment of the\n1991 Constitution. The Senate has been reluctant to engage in the\ndevelopment of gender and sexual diversity rights and legislative initiatives\npresented in 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2006 have been defeated. In several cases\nConstitutional Court sentences mention not only the protection of individual\nrights but the need to develop social policies, administrative measures,\ncommunicative and educational strategies and other actions in order to affect\nthe causes and consequences of discrimination based on gender or sexual\ndiversity. The Constitutional Court has recognised that there is a big distance\nbetween legal advances and everyday life factors that affect the realisation of\npeople´s rights. In other words, the development of public policies and\naffirmative actions regarding gender and sexual diversity has a Constitutional\nmandate in Colombia.\n3 A public policy scheme for LGBT\nrights and gender and sexual\ndiversity in Bogotá\nThe signing of Decree 608 was the first time in the city that a Mayor\nestablished a clear responsibility to integrate topics of gender and sexual\ndiversity into public policies. Because of it, several programmes and goals of\nthe 2008–2012 Development Plan of the City were oriented toward LGBT\nsocial sectors.6 Decree 608 was the answer to the commitment acquired by the\nMayor with several LGBT activists and organisations in the city around 2002,\nwhen he was presidential candidate. At that time LGBT organisations and\nactivists had started national coalition initiatives, had incorporated in their\npolitical agendas actions to participate in peace building projects, and were\nlobbying to obtain permanent and sustainable answers to their needs. In other\n5 Constitutional Court, Sentences T-477 of 1995; 337 of 1999; T-551 of 1999; T-692 of 1999; T-1390 of\n2000; T-1025 of 2002; T-1021 of 2003.\n6 The current Development Plan of the city, Bogotá positiva: para vivir mejor – Positive Bogota: for a\nBetter Life, has in its Programme Bogotá respeta la diversidad – Bogotá Respects Diversity, a project\ncalled Bogotá diversa – Diverse Bogotá which includes four goals connected with the rights of LGBT\nsocial sectors and with the training of public employees and citizens in gender identities, sexual\norientations and diversity.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n17\nwords, it was a moment in which accumulated political experience created the\nconditions to position the topic of gender diversity and sexual orientation in the\nhands of politicians and decision makers.\nWhat is behind this description is a question of how a topic that was\nprosecuted or ignored before in the policies of the city becomes a matter of\npublic attention: a particular affirmative attention which associates gender and\nsexual diversity with the development of the city and its performance in rights\npolicies. To include a topic in public agendas implies several actions and\nstrategies implemented not only by the social actor directly affected but also by\nother social actors such as politicians and public servants (Roth 2007: 18).\nAccording to Roth, the inclusion of topics in public agendas can be caused by\nthe perception of an inequity; by the interest in making a matter a political\nobject; as a reaction to an unexpected situation or to ameliorate wellbeing of\nindividuals (ibid.: 19). From this point of view, based on political sciences and\npublic management, a topic is incorporated in public agendas to transform a\nsituation perceived as inadequate.\nHowever, from a cultural point of view the focusing of public attention on a\ntopic is related to conflicts between subjectivities, social representations and\ncultural meanings. That is the case with Clarke’s work on homoeroticism and\nthe public sphere (2000). According to him, the increasing presence and\ninclusion of homoerotic representations in public culture (in the United States)\nis associated with the production of normalised constructions of homosexuality.\nThe promise of inclusion raised by affirmative policies implies important\ntransformations in the ways than a group understand their needs and interests\n(ibid.: 9). As I mentioned before, the presence of LGBT rights discussions in\nthe public sphere in Colombia can be seen as contributions to democratisation.\nHowever, as Clarke analyses, the ideal of publicness is contradicted by the\nconformity with the standards of the ‘normal citizen’ stated by public\ndiscourses. In the case of Bogotá, public policies about gender and sexual\ndiversity had to fit with the notions of citizenship established in long term social\npolicies. Despite the current presence of gender and sexually diverse people in\nthe landscape of public policies meaning they are not invisible as before, this\nvisibility works under a regime of institutionalised and nonthreatening diversity.\nTo understand how this normalised idea of citizenship was produced it is\nimportant to consider the transformation of public policies in the city. Since the\n1990s, public and social policies in Bogotá experimented important changes\nbecause of an orientation toward economic, infrastructural and social\ndevelopment, growth and management (Corredor 2010: 36). At the beginning\nof the 2000s, in the middle of a favourable economic cycle, development plans\nin the city were oriented toward social inclusion, deepening of democracy,\ncitizenship and civic culture (ibid.: 172). The notion of ‘social inclusion’ was a\nkey concept in social policies as the answer to the exclusion caused by\npoverty, underdevelopment, inequality and lack of access to services (Mockus\n2003). The idea of ‘inclusion’ as reaction to ‘exclusion’ created mainly in a\nsocioeconomic context was expanded to social policies and to the relation with\ndiscriminated or vulnerable populations, as can be seen in the social policies of\nthe early 2000s. The approach here was very much related with the ‘inside/\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n18\noutside rhetoric’ mentioned by Fuss (1991), in which it is ‘good’ to bring to the\ncentre what is in the margins.\nDuring the administration of Luis Eduardo Garzón (2004–2008) public policies\ncontinued its focus on the fight against poverty and exclusion but stressed a\nrights based approach. Ideas such as ‘active citizenship’, diversity and the\nrecognition of particular populations on vulnerability were also incorporated. As\nnever before, a commitment to the development of specific actions for some of\nthese populations, such as disabled people, Roma communities, indigenous\ncommunities, Afrocolombians, youth, children, and the elderly, was expressed\nin the formulation of specific public policies to each of them.\nThis rights based approach can be seen as part of global trends implemented\nthrough development and multilateral agencies but also as the implementation\nof the language of rights stated in the 1991 Constitution and the importance of\nhuman rights demands for social mobilisation amid the socio-political conflict. It\nwas also part of a focus on equal opportunities and the development of\ncapacities in citizens to exercise rights (Corredor 2010: 25). Because of that,\nan idea of ‘active citizenship’ and ‘co-responsibility’ of individuals and\ncommunities in the realisation of rights was incorporated in social policies.\nHowever, this notion represented a challenge to populations who had a long\ntradition of exclusion from the public sphere and created a standard that was\nnot easy to reach for them.\nDespite the fact that topics of gender diversity and sexual orientation were not\nincluded in the 2004–2008 Development Plan of the city, as a result of the\ncommitment of the then Mayor with LGBT leaders and organisations, and a\ncertain interest of his political party in non discrimination and inclusion of LGBT\npeople, several actions started to be implemented. The conditions prior to\nDecree 608 of 2007 can be described in three simultaneous types of inter-\nvention: development of institutional infrastructure, support to initiatives of\nLGBT organisations and creation of a legal and planning framework.\nIn relation to the first type of interventions, after 2007 several institutions hired\npersons to implement actions with respect to gender and sexual diversity. They\nworked in three ways: inside institutions, they opened spaces for the\ndiscussion and inclusion of LGBT topics in the programmes of each institution;\noutside them, they become a reference for LGBT activists and organisations;\namong themselves, the need for more articulated, sustained and coordinated\nactivities between institutions become significant. In addition, two new entities\nwith specific responsibilities for gender and sexual diversity were created: in\nSecretaría Distrital de Planeación – City Planning Department, a sub-\ndepartment for Women, Genders and Sexual Diversity was opened. In the\nInstituto Distrital para la Participación y la Accción Comunual – City Institute for\nParticipation and Civic Action, an Office for Women and Genders was\nestablished with the mission of supporting the participation of lesbian, gay,\nbisexual and transgender persons and their organisations in the policies of the\ncity.\nThe second type of interventions involved the support for projects and activities\nof organisations. Between 2004 and 2007 the City Hall and some of its\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n19\ninstitutions continued supporting initiatives of LGBT organisations and their\nleaders, such as the Marcha de la Ciudadanía LGBT – LGBT Citizenship\nMarch, academic and flm festivals, and sports events. The Alianza por la\nCiudadanía Plena – Full Citizenship Alliance, was established as a participatory\nspace in which LGBT organisations and persons could express their needs and\nconcerns and hear from public institutions their answers, initiatives and results.\nThe strengthening of LGBT organisations was also supported as part of the\nmandate to develop the participation of civil society in the administration of the\ncity. In 2006, actions such as the appointment of a police force member as the\nLGBT Liaison officer, the conduct of a public campaign against discrimination\nbased on gender identity or sexual orientation and the opening of an LGBT\nCommunity Centre achieved demands that were part of the agendas of LGBT\norganisations and activists.\nFinally, with this accumulated experience, LGBT activists and organisations\ndemanded the creation of a policy scheme to coordinate activities in a sustain-\nable action plan protected by a legal framework. This need led to the writing of\nDecree 608 with its Guidelines and Action Plan to be implemented over a\nlonger term (2008–2020). The title of the scheme: Política Pública para la\ngarantía plena de derechos de personas lesbianas, gay, bisexuals y\ntransgeneristas – LGBT – y sobre identidades de género y orientaciones\nsexuales en el Distrito Capital – Public Policy for the full guarantee of rights of\nlesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender – LGBT– people and about gender\nidentities and sexual orientations in the Capital District, was result of a long\ndebate that will be mentioned later. I will abbreviate this title as PPDLGBT in\nthe rest of the document.\nThis scheme was considered important in order to have a reference point to\nmeasure the impact of the actions implemented, to coordinate them and to\nguarantee the responsibility of the city on the topic. In order to do that,\nparticipatory activities with a wide variety of lesbian, gay, bisexual and\ntransgender persons and organisations were done between August and\nSeptember 2007; national and international experiences in the field were\ncompared and considered, including the holding of a conference in August\n2007 in Bogotá; and finally a team of professionals of different institutions,\nbetween October and November 2007, prepared and discussed with experts in\nthe field and LGBT leaders the main elements of the PPDLGBT scheme.\nAs a framework for the definition of actions Decree 608 of 2007 spells out:\n\u0002 The needs that motivated a public policy on the topic and the existing legal\nframe that demanded actions in the field.\n\u0002 The principles that should orient any action implemented, such as\nentitlement to and protection of rights; autonomy; identity; solidarity;\ndiversity; participation.\n\u0002 The objectives of that kind of policy, related to the full guarantee of rights\nof lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people; the adaptation of public\ninstitutions in order to protect their rights; the need for capacity building in\nLGBT organisations to represent their needs; the promotion of a non\ndiscriminatory culture in the city.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n20\n\u0002 A structure for the planning of actions at the levels of: development of\nservices and capacities in institutions to guarantee LGBT rights;\nparticipation of people and organisation in the definition, implementation\nand evaluation of actions; transformation of negative social and cultural\nrepresentations of gender and sexual diversity; development of knowledge\nwhich supported the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the\nactions on the topic.\n\u0002 The responsibilities of the different public institutions involved in the\ncoordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of actions.\n\u0002 The mechanisms for civil society to participate in its implementation: a\npermanent commission of representatives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and\ntransgender people was created.\n4 The paradoxes of gender and\nsexual diversity policies\nIn this part I will provide several examples of how a policy like this is not only a\nhybrid space in relation to its dual condition of state legitimated initiative and\nsociety enforced action but also as the combination of different types of\ninitiatives for change. I will look at the case in relation with the kind of policy it\nrepresents; who is its subject; where its field of action is; how it acquires a\ncertain value in the landscape of rights policies; what it says in relation to\nparticipation of civil society actors. The paradoxes are the result of conflicts\nover meanings of such policies and between political agendas of state and civil\nsociety actors.\n4.1 What kind of policy is it in relation with other policies?\nA historic and long duration survey of gender and sexual diversity, particularly\nof male homosexuality, could find that it has been often a matter of regulation\nand policy by states and their institutions. However, it will be beyond the reach\nof this paper to look at the different ways in which non heterosexual practices\nor non binary experiences have been regulated by policies. The case I am\nmentioning here represents a very particular instance of interaction between\ngender and sexual diversity and policies, in which both affect each other.\nDuring the process of design of the PPDLGBT several models and experiences\nwere considered. An international conference with experiences from the\nNetherlands, Canada, Spain, Argentina, Brazil and four other Colombian cities\nwas held in Bogotá in 2007 in order to discuss different ways in which states\ndeal with the topic (Serrano 2008). Policy schemes such as the ones\nimplemented in London, Manchester and some cities in the United States were\nalso revised. The conclusion of this revision, despite its simplicity, was very\nimportant: behind some similarities based on the mention of LGBT persons and\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n21\ntheir organisations as base of the initiatives, all experiences varied owing to\nthe political contexts and political cultures which frame them. Public policies\nalready implemented regarding sexual orientation or gender diversity presented\na diverse landscape, which was incorporated with different degrees of intensity\ninto the PPDLGBT:\n\u0002 There are policies focused on discrimination which materialises in the\nsanction of prejudiced behaviours by public servants and the abuse of\nforce by police members\n\u0002 Some policies includes actions related to equal opportunities and are\nexpressed, for example, in the development of work alternatives for socially\nexcluded LGBT people\n\u0002 Other policies offer access to services, such as the implementation of\nLGBT community centres, housing, health provision or education\n\u0002 Some have affirmative actions, particularly in aspects related to access to\neducation, symbolic initiatives or promotion of cultural changes.\nThe rights perspective that is the foundation of the PPDLGBT gives it a\nparticular condition when compared to other initiatives in the field already\nimplemented in Latin America or in some European cities, which tend to focus\non one or some of the previous aspects mentioned before. This rights\nperspective used in the PPDLGBT departs from the marginalisation and\nexclusion that affects people because of their gender identity or sexual\norientation and the way it is perceived in a heteronormative social system. Its\nnovelty as policy design in relation with other previous actions is the\nconsideration of LGBT people as subjects of rights which are affected by\nseveral structural factors; its challenge is that that approach includes a wide\nrange of actions to be implemented.7\nMonro (2005) discusses mainstream approaches to social policies in relation to\ngender and sexual diversity. According to her view, rational comprehensive\nmodels applied to sexual orientation and gender diversity policies stress the\nrational comprehension of problems, either by people or by policy designers,\nand develop actions in order to solve problems, excluding other issues and\nreinforcing status quo (ibid.: 71). Incrementalist models, on the other hand,\npromote change through small adjustments and present policy changes trying\nto minimise opposition (ibid.). If these models were to be used in the case of\nthe PPDLGBT both could be presented: while the rational model was the basis\nfor the design of it, an incrementalist model has been applied in its\n7 Decree 608 was developed in an Action Plan to be implemented in the period 2008–2020. 79 actions\nwere defined based on the different consulting processes with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender\npeople and their organisations, public servants, academics and experts who participated in the\ndefinition of the PPDLGBT. A permanent system for monitoring and evaluation of results was also\ncreated. This system includes in the monitoring both the perspective of institutions and of lesbian, gay,\nbisexual and transgender people and their organisations and representatives, as part of the\nparticipatory principles that lead the PPDLGBT. 40 actions will be implemented in the period\n2008–2012, as part of the goals of the current development plan of the city.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n22\nimplementation. The design of the PPDLGBT appealed to a rational model\nmainly because of the hegemonic trends established in public institutions in the\ncity. It is important to consider that the PPDLGBT design and coordination is in\nthe charge of the City Planning Department. During implementation of the\nPPDLGBT, as Monro found in other experiences in the UK, an incrementalist\napproach has been useful to reduce tensions inside institutions and to convene\nthe participation of public employees who are reluctant to participate in such\npolicies. Both approaches, following Monro, are useful because their\npragmatism, but fail to unpick the deeper issues that marginalise gender and\nsexual diverse people (ibid.: 72). Here, however, I want to develop this idea in\na different way, considering the particularities of the Colombian context and the\nvalue that law and policies have in this country.\nIt is important to mention again that what is particular in the PPDLGBT is that it\nresults from activism and lobbying by LGBT activists and their organisations\nand not as an initiative of public institutions. It has to find itself a place in\ninstitutions and development plans in order to mobilise resources and obtain\nsustainability. So, its pragmatism is not just a goal oriented process but a way\nto ensure, through institutions, a project of social transformation. According to\nthe Grupo de Investigación en Ciudadanías Incluyentes – Research Group on\nInclusive Citizenships (2009: 41), in societies such as Colombia because of the\nhigh presence of inequality and power concentration, citizenship is not just an\nexercise but a conquest via social subjects’ actions. In this way, from the point\nof view of social actors, laws and policies they have been promoting have not\njust a pragmatic sense such as solving a problem but also a symbolic meaning.\nLemaitre (2009) in a study of indigenous, youth and LGBT social movements in\nColombia concludes that the importance they give to law and policies represent\na horizon of sense which directs their constitution as subjects of rights. In a\ncertain way, what it is here is not only the ‘right to have rights’ mentioned\nbefore but the ‘right to create rights’ through struggles, participation and\ndemands from below, as mentioned by Gaventa (2007: xiii). The connection\nbetween politics and culture which underlies the previous ideas implies a\nbroadening of the notion of citizenship beyond incorporation to consider\nstruggles for citizenship as projects for new sociabilities (Dagningo 2005: 154).\nHowever, the question of what kind of policy the PPDLGBT is, is far from being\nresolved by mentioning the importance of its symbolic value for subject to\nrenegotiate their relation with the State, the public sphere and themselves.\nActivists who were lobbying for such actions have long been insisting on the\ndefinition of LGBT sectors as a social sector historically discriminated against.\nWhile in the next part I will explore the implications of this idea for the definition\nof who is the subject of this policy, here I want to explore what it means for the\ndefinition of the policy itself. As Monro (2005) also found in the case of sexual\norientation work in local governments in the UK, in the PPDLGBT sexual\nminorities are represented mainly as victims of violence and discrimination.\nI mentioned at the start of this paper the multiple violations of human rights\nexperienced by gender and sexual minorities in the country. The point here is\nnot to question the reality of those facts but how the representation of it affects\nthe way in which the issue is constructed as object of public policies. The effect\nof this representation is that the fight against homophobia and violence\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n23\nbecame the articulating point in the definition of policies, reducing or limiting\nother ways to understand gender and sexual diversity issues. This reduction in\nhomophobia has several traps, already presented: in the discussions held in\nthe City Council of Bogotá in early 2007 to approve the first attempts of this\npolicy, political sectors against it such as conservative Christians stated that\nthey were not homophobic since they did not hate gays. Since their opposition\nwas not based on homophobia, they continued, it was based on considering\nthis kind of ruling inappropriate, unnecessary, illegal, and a way to give gays\nprivileges than other citizens did not have.\nHomophobia is a very important concept in LGBT activisms. Inside LGBT\norganisations and activists in Bogota there is tendency to open the concept of\nhomophobia in order to make it clear the specific situations of discrimination\nexperienced by lesbians, bisexual and transgender people. In order to do that\nconcepts such ‘lesbofobia’, ‘bifobia’ or ‘transfobia’ have been coined. Moreover,\nsome common activist initiatives are the Campañas de Vacunación contra la\nHomofobia – Vaccination Campaigns against Homophobia, in which public\nreceive vaccines and other symbolic signals of being ‘cured’ of homophobia. In\nspite of the important symbolic and performative content of such actions and\nthe proliferation of categories to explain situations, they maintain the\npathologisation of sexualities, heterosexuals included. This situation could be\nseen as contradictory if we consider that it is a strategy promoted by those\nwhose sexualities were pathologised before. Policies that promote change in\ngender and sexual diversity mainly looking at discrimination and homophobia\nhave an implicit message that once heterosexuals stop fearing gays and\nlesbians, exclusion and marginalisation will stop (Chambers 2007). In several\ntraining activities with police force members in which I have participated, I have\nseen the same logic: Police members consider that once individuals change,\nhomophobia in police departments will stop. That is why a shift to hetero-\nnormativity, which moves the attention to the institutional, cultural and legal\nnorms that privilege and makes desirable and demanded heterosexuality\n(ibid.), is very important in this kind of gender and sexual minorities policy .\nIn order to create a balance between the recognition of the particular violence\naffecting LGBT people and communities and a more positive approach to their\nexperiences, the design of the PPDLGBT included several chapters to mention\ntheir presence as actors of the urban living and producers of culture and social\ntransformation. However, this is still a topic to be developed in the imple-\nmentation of the PPDLBGT and can also be discussed as part of an agenda of\nmaking people recognised because they are ‘good citizens’.\nIn fact, the challenge that faces the PPDLGBT both for those who have the\nduty to implement it and for LGBT activists and organisations, is how to\nimplement a rights perspective which is not just focused on the negative part of\nrights violations and discrimination. As is clearly stated in mainstream\napproaches to public policies, it is during implementation that a gap between\nits design and its development appears. This gap seems to be filled with the\npreconceptions, usual solutions and previous knowledge acquired, as I could\nsee during my experience as consultant in the implementation of the PPDL-\nGBT. This situation is of particular importance if it is considered that public\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n24\nemployees are not always prepared to express in specific activities what a\nrights based approach implies. The movement from seeing communities as\n‘beneficiaries’ of a service to ‘subjects of rights’ is not only a matter of changes\nin the language of policies but a global transformation in public institutions that\nis still in development. This situation, at the level of local administrations, for\nexample, is affecting the allocation of budgets for the implementation of\nactions. In other cases, decision-making is still based on empathies, affiliations\nor implicit alliances with LGBT organisations and persons, which can be useful\ntemporarily but do not lead to the institutionalisation of compromises.\nAt the moment of implementing the PPDLGBT public servants in charge of\ncoordinating it resorted to a traditional model of dividing rights for sectors\n(education, health, security, culture, participation) and to prioritise them (in\ntopics such as safety and non discrimination). Despite it being the way public\nadministration is organised, this division and hierarchy was contrary to the\nprinciple of indivisibility of rights. Some authors have criticised this logic\nbecause of the privileged status granted by mainstream liberal theorists to civil\nand political rights over economic, social and cultural rights (Kabeer 2007: 15).\nAt the same time, the reduction of a policy like this just to an anti-homophobic\nagenda will constrain it in the frameworks of interest-group liberalism\n(Chambers 2007: 664). The result is the adjustment of a traditional logic of\nacting in segments which is contrary to the idea of power acting as a multi-\ndimensional force and to the consideration of change targeting different\nspheres of social life.\n4.2 Who is the subject of this policy?\nSocial policies have to deal with the fact of defining who the subject of certain\ninterventions is. This is not only important for political reasons but also for\nmore pragmatic reasons, for example at the moment of evaluating the impact\nof an intervention in a certain population or to make clear who are the users of\ncertain services. However, the fluidity of gender and sexual categories makes\nthis definition of subjects more difficult than in the case of other policies, such\nas youth policies where demographic criteria like age can be used. The\nchallenges presented by this fluidity are usually faced with heteronormative\nactions. In this part I will describe some of them.\nOne, maybe the most evident, heteronormative action to deal with fluid\nsexualities and gender is to label them in restricted ways. This case is\npresented in the forms used to register who are the users of the services\noffered by the PPDLBT. The current form used by one of the leading\ninstitutions of the PPDLGBT to collect statistics about participation in their\nactivities (coded IDPAC-GD-F14 V.2) follows the name of the person with\nseveral boxes to fill in, associated with gender, sexual orientation and ethnic\ngroup. What is interesting is not the fact that users are asked to fill those boxes\nwith predefined options, but the explanation the form gives to the cases when\nno information is provided. According to the form, if a person does not fill any\nof the options given for sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual) it is assumed\nthat the person is heterosexual. A similar assumption is made in the case of\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n25\nethnic group: five options are given but if none is chosen, the option of not\nbelonging to any group is assumed to apply.\nWhat is behind this example is not just the problem faced at the moment to\nreport who are the users of a public policy intervention. Indeed institutions\nneed to have adequate data to support where and who are the beneficiaries of\ntheir interventions. However, in that attempt institutions are using two logics:\none, the presumption that people use and are comfortable applying identity\nlabels to them; second, the restriction of ways to talk about sexuality to the\nhomo-hetero divide in which when not stated, heterosexuality is the norm. In\nthe above example, the possible unintelligibility of gender and sexuality pro-\nduced when people do not fill the boxes is resolved by a simple constraining\npractice: if it is clear as ‘the other’ it must be ‘the same’. Heteronormativity is\nparallel to whiteness: they do not need to be expressed since they are the\nparameter of sediment and ingrained privilege (Chambers 2007: 666).\nHowever, this is just a basic example of the structural problems faced by these\nkinds of policies when they need to define who their subject is. That situation\nwas also evident at the moment of using identity labels (gay, lesbian, bisexual,\ntransgender) in its title. During the process of definition, for some LGBT\nactivists the mentioning of those words in the policy was very important in\norder to obtain visibility at the public policies level and was consequent with the\nLGBT mobilisation which supported the PPDLGBT. For others, such as some of\nthe ones more connected with queer theory and policy debates, the use of\nthose labels was at risks of freezing the subjects of the PPDLGBT with the\nsubsequent effect of excluding other persons who do not use those labels to\ndescribe themselves. The discussion reached points such as the question of\nwhether a straight person who falls victim of violence because of his-her\ngender expression would be subject or not of the PPDLGBT, with some\npersons saying that ‘straights already have their spaces and rights recognised’\nwhile others considered that some actions should be developed for non-\nconformist heterosexual persons as well. The debates in the team who\ndesigned the PPDGLGBT at the end of 2007 negotiated an intermediate point\nin which identity labels (lesbianas, gays, bisexuales y transgeneristas) and\ncategories (orientaciones sexuales e identidades de género, sexual orientation\nand gender identity in plural) were used in the title of the policy. A point that\nboth sides of the debate shared was that the Decree to be signed by the Major\nof Bogotá should not have any dictionary-style definition of who is each identity\nin the LGBT acronym because of the risks of assigning the definition of\npeople´s identities to a legal document. What was stated in Decree 608 and\nthe Guidelines of the PPDLGBT was the recognition of the historicity and\nvariability of the ways in which people talk about their gender and sexual\ndiversity. However, in the process of implementation, the PPDLGBT focused on\nthe first part of its approach to subjects (those under identity labels) leaving\nunexplored the implications of a broader approach to other non-normative\ngenders and sexualities.\nMore than a matter of names and labels, what that discussion expressed was\nthe relation of such a public policy with the politics of visibility that have been\nleading LGBT activism and organisations. The issue of access to the public\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n26\n8 Here I prefer to use the term ‘travesti’ because I am referring basically to male-to-female persons in\nsexual work and they prefer to use that word. The notion of ‘transgender’ started to be used by\nColombian LGBT activists and politics in line with international trends. In our context, ‘transgender’\nand it inclusion in the LGBT acronym has emerged as a category of collective identities and political\nactivism that recently started to be institutionalised by public policies.\n9 I base this affirmation in conversations with transgender leaders in Bogotá, particularly with Diana\nNavarro.\nsphere and its effect on the visibility of homosexual identities has been a long\nfield of discussion in gay, lesbian and queer studies (Fuss 1991). Politics of\nvisibility, as part of lesbian and gay activism, act as a way to create ‘positive’\nand affirmative representations of those sexualities (Clarke 2000: 29).\nHowever, politics of visibility have a structural contradiction: claiming to picture\n‘authentic’ representations of how people are, they create a calculated\nnormalcy (ibid.). Even more, as in the case I am exploring, because this\nvisibility is done toward the public sphere and as a collective actor – ‘LGBT\nsocial sectors’ – it requires a way to make valuable that presence. Clarke\nidentifies three modes in which politics of visibility create value to sexualities\nthat before were considered ‘vicious’: conforming to heteronormative\nnarratives; adding commercial and market value to this presence; granting\nauthenticity to those representations. In the following paragraphs and chapters\nI will explore how these operations appeared in the PPDLGBT, starting with a\nmention of how a collective sense was developed.\nIn Colombia the mobilisation and the development of organisations currently\ncovered under the umbrella acronym LGBT are the result of previous collective\nefforts to transform discriminations based on gender identity or sexual\norientation. These efforts have different origins: some of them were originated\nin the early 70s by the spread of USA-based ‘gay pride’ movements, with a\nstrong focus on gay male identities. The influence of Sexpol theories and\nEuropean liberation ideologies can also be traced in the work of some pioneers\nof the homosexual movement in the country, such as León Zuleta (Zuleta\n1996). However, particular versions or liberation theories and collaborations of\nhomosexuals with other social movements such as workers and communism\nexisted in the region before the spread of the Stonewall-Gay Pride model.\nLesbians have their own history in the Latin-American feminist movements with\nalliances because of shared causes, such as the fight against patriarchy, but\nalso tensions because of heterosexism inside women´s organisations\n(Mogrovejo 2001). Some transgender women, particularly travesties,8 have\norganised themselves around sexual work at least since late 1990s.9 In the late\n80s and 90s the fight against HIV-AIDS created a new frame for collective\nactions and demanded ways to relate with State and public actors, particularly\nwith health policies and laws, using public policy frameworks. This last aspect\nwas not exclusive of Colombia but a regional trend (Rios 2006).\nAround 2,000 local and national organisations of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and\ntransgender persons allied around the Project Planeta Paz, an experience for\nthe inclusion of socially excluded sectors in the peace process in the country.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n27\n10 I base this affirmation in the following of discussions in two mail lists with national and local focus:\nlgbt-bogota@yahoogroups.com and planeta_paz@yahoogroups.com.\nThis alliance allowed framing their concerns and grievances in a wider and\nmore open discourse of social justice (Serrano 2003). In this process they\nentered in dialogue with other social movements working on race, gender,\nclass, unionism, and peasants’ mobilisation. It was in this scenery that the\nacronym LGBT was incorporated, putting the word L at first, as an affirmative\naction against the discrimination faced by lesbian women (ibid.). It was also the\nmoment in which bisexuality as an identity in need of recognition started to be\nmentioned and that several activists made themselves visible as bisexuals\n(ibid.). The LGBT acronym facilitated the construction of a shared experience\nof oppression, useful for collective action.\nTo create an articulated national agenda was not an easy task and the results\nwere contradictory (Serrano 2003). However, the experience in Planeta Paz\nimproved the political discourses of LGBT organisations and activists, nurtured\nalliances with persons in decision-making positions and created conditions to\nclaim the responsibility of the State in the transformation of discrimination and\nexclusion based on gender identities or sexual orientation. The first attempts to\ndemand actions by public institutions in Bogotá were based on the experiences\nand documents produced by participants in the Planeta Paz experience.\nHowever, the sense of collective created in the mentioned process was\nundermined by internal tension due to class, regional, ethnic and gender\ndifferences, among others factors. The conversion of grievances on gender and\nsexual diversity to a frame based on political identities has been contested\ninside organisations working on the topic as the imposition of a modern and\nurban model of activism (Serrano 2003). In much of Colombia gay identities\nand LGBT activism are still considered a product of middle class affiliations and\nlife in capital cities. The invisibility of topics related with race and ethnicity\ninside LGBT organisations also reveals the implicit racism present throughout\nColombian society.\nThe acronym LGBT has been useful as a way to organise and to promote\nalliances among the social mobilisations seeking to change discrimination and\nexclusion based on gender and sexual diversities. It has been also useful for\nvisibility and to obtain a political presence in between social movements and\nstate agents. However, it also tends to assimilate the needs and demands of a\ndiverse range of groups. Discussions inside LGBT groups and activists in the\ncity and the country had clearly stated that the needs of lesbians are not the\nsame as those of gay men, nor do theirs equate with the needs of transgender\npersons; even more, inside transgender communities there are important\ndifferences between trans women and trans men.10 The acronym LGBT is\nunder permanent discussion in the local and national mobilisation for gender\nand sexual diversity rights, making evident its instability and fictional but\nstrategic condition.\nOrganisations interrelated using the LGBT acronym reproduce in their own\nrights discourses the system of hierarchies of difference established by\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n28\ndiversity policies in Colombia. This relates to social structure differences\namong lesbians, gay men, or transgender men and women owing to gender\nhierarchies that maintain male dominance over other community members. It is\nalso produced by the prevalence of identity discourses over gender order\ndiscussions which created a fictional alignment in the LGBT acronym (Connell\n2010). This prevalence of identity discourses has been made clear in the\nimplementation of the PPDLGBT: messages and images produced focus on the\nrecognition of LGBT people while there is silence or erasure of diversity among\nheterosexuals or their possibility as allies for social transformation.\nDifferences in the LGBT alliance are not only in terms of the different identities\nwhich conflux there. Apart from the class, regional and ethnic differences men-\ntioned before, there are also differences created by levels of articulation in\nactivist organisations and in ways to express grievances. There are different\nways of understanding collective action for social transformation by people\nlocated in different positions in the social and gender order. Following the work\nof Fetherston (2000) I see LGBT activists and organisations developing both\ncounter-hegemonic and anti-hegemonic strategies based on rights discourses\nto promote justice and social change.11 However, anti-hegemonic strategies,\nsuch as those used by travesties,12 are not part of formal LGBT agendas, while\ncounter-hegemonic practices developed by established LGBT organisations are\nthe ones leading litigation and public policies. Transgender experiences, espe-\ncially of Transgender women, are positioned in a subaltern position in LGBT13\nagendas.\nSome travestis or queer youth in sexual exploitation do not express their needs\nin the languages or mechanisms of participation established by public\ninstitutions, basically because of mistrust and lack of knowledge about them.\n11 In an attempt to understand how power relations can be transformed in the search for social change,\nFetherston (2000) proposes two possibilities: ‘anti-hegemonic projects’ and ‘counter (local)-hegemonic\nprojects’. Following Davina Cooper, the first ones are defined as ‘[…] ‘ “localized episodes” of\nconfrontation and change which do not privilege any particular social force and are, therefore, not “uni\nvocal”’ (ibid.: 209). Those projects are mainly actions of contestation and deconstruction oriented to\nthe opening of spaces for difference. The possibility of social change in this kind of strategy is minimal\namong other reasons because there is not any attempt to accumulate actions or concentrate more\ncollective efforts for change. Some performative actions of LGBT groups such as parades, kiss-ins or\ndrag shows can have this impact. The other possibility mentioned by Fetherston, ‘counter-(local)\nhegemonic projects’ finds a maximal reach of transformation. In order to achieve this ‘[…] a counter-\nhegemonic project aims to build a consensus among non-dominant groups which articulates an alter\nnative direction for social life’ (ibid.). The consideration of these projects as ‘local’ recognises the\npossibility of particular groups creating wider changes through their agendas (ibid. 211). Moreover the\nconcept of ‘local hegemony’ does not require a ‘unitary agency’ but allows the presence of more\n‘fragmentary means’ to achieve power transformations (ibid.). The PPDLGBT can be considered an\nexample of the second possibility mentioned to achieve change, since it results from the consolidation\nof a political agenda consolidated through years of activism and negotiated using lobby strategies,\nlegal frames and interaction with political institutions and structures, as was described above.\n12 I retain the Spanish term as it has cultural nuances not conveyed by ‘transvestite’ or ‘transgender’.\n13 Some Colombian Transgender Women hyphenate the acronym to form ‘LGB-T’, separating ‘T’ to call\nattention to the difference and subordination of their needs and grievances.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n29\n14 This lack of representation can be seen in the participatory processes that based the PPDLGBT policy\nscheme and in the title itself, which does not include a mention to Intersex people.\nOther persons do not articulate their needs in terms of agendas, plans or clear\ndemands able to be solved by State agents but more in terms of dreams,\nfantasies or high scale social and cultural transformations. Even more, at the\nmoment in which the Bogota public policy scheme was being designed,\nactivism was not present among intersex and transgender men activism in the\nsame way as among gay, lesbian or trans women. This absence meant that,\ndespite some efforts to make visible their voices, their needs were under-\nrepresented.14 Looking from a ‘gender politics’ (Connell 2003) perspective, the\nsubjectivities which based and at the same time are transformed by a policy\nlike the one studied here, are not just the result of identity discussions but are\nstrongly connected with gender dynamics at the intimate and national-regional\nlevel (Connell 2010).\nAnother factor that makes this situation harder is that state agents and\ninstitutions tend to stress the dialogue with LGBT activists or those who can\nspeak the same language of institutions and have programmatic agendas. The\neffect of this situation is the hearing of just certain voices considered the\nbearers of truth about people´s needs and that access to grassroots\ncommunities is mediated by those experts. The ones who do not see\nthemselves through identity labels or are not connected with LGBT\norganisations and activists could not feel part of these policies.\nIn an attempt to avoid those risks the consulting processes done for the design\nof the PPDLGBT coordinated by the Instituto Distrital para la Participación y la\nAcción Comunal – IDPAC, were organised not only by identities but also by\nsocial conditions such as generation, ability, or restriction of liberty. Talking not\nonly with participants of organisations but also with people who are not\nparticipating in any group or mobilisation process has been another strategy\nused, basically with an implicit principle of expanding the base of actors\nconsulted in each participation. In other cases particular conditions for the\nparticipation of certain social actors have been created. That is the case of the\nconsultations and dialogue with LGBT hearing impaired persons, in which\ninterpreters where allocated and specific meetings where arranged with them.\nSimilar conditions were created for consultations with travesties in sex work,\narranging the meetings not only in places close to their working areas but also\nin moments that did not compete with their working hours.\nCurrently, some organisations in the city are creating their own spaces to\ncoordinate, interact and participate without using the traditional structures of\nhierarchical organisation or identity organisation. They tend to privilege the\nsharing of specific interests, such as working with arts, or to collaborate in\nparticular moments and activities, keeping their specificities. In this way, they\nwork not only as ‘laboratories of self interest’ and ‘politics of transformation’ as\nCornwall and Coelho (2007) mention, but also as peer learning and small\ncoalitions organised by new generations of leaders to gain the experience and\nknowledge that previous representatives have.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n30\n4.3 Where a policy like this acts?\nEarly in 2007, when interrogated about its defense of LGBT rights, the Mayor\nof the city said he imagined Bogotá having a gay district like Chueca in Madrid\nor Castro in San Francisco and that they inspired his approach to LGBT\npolicies.15 Chapinero, a mixed commercial and residential middle class area,\nwas the place he named to host that gay district. Reactions did not wait and\nmedia debates increased regarding an ‘invasion’ of gays to that area and the\n‘displacement’ of its traditional inhabitants. Some activists considered it a\nghetto strategy, opposite to the idea of living freely throughout the entire city.\nThe declaration of the Mayor, which had the intention of creating public debate:\nwas based on the fact that Chapinero has concentrated a vibrant gay circuit of\nbars, restaurants, discos and services.\nThere was another factor underlying that claim to have a gay district in the city:\npublic policies at that time had an interest in reaching the territories where\npeople live. Challenging a traditional approach in which services where\nconcentrated in certain areas and citizens had problems accessing them,\nterritorialisation was not only a decentralised action but also a strategy to\nconnect people in their own territories with institutions. Because of this\nemphasis institutions develop maps, cartographies and other ways to\ngeoreference communities, vulnerable areas, concentrations of services and in\ngeneral mechanisms to place policies in territories.\nHowever, it was not the first time than queer people and communities had a\npresence in territories. In a compilation of essays on space, geographies and\nqueer subjects, Ingram, Bouthillette and Retter (1997) identify different ways in\nwhich those subjects create and appropriate spaces, giving them a sexual and\ngender meaning. For them, queer spaces destabilise heteronormativity on\nterritories and open the possibilities of homoerotic expression. Queer spaces\nare not just physical areas but include networks, nodes, queerscapes and\ncommuties as much as actions of placemaking, appropriation and\nterritorialisation (ibid.: 449). Considering this it is clear that sexual and gender\ndiverse minorities have a presence in public spaces that has been previous\nand parallel to its political recognition. However, this experience of the city was\nalso affected by differences among those minorities. Trans women doing sex\nwork, for example, have claimed that their experience of the city follows two\ntrends (Gil and Navarro 2008): one, some of them arrive to the city and to the\nareas where they work and live as displaced from other cities or areas of the\ncity; the areas where they live are partially safe because of a long experience\nof appropriation of spaces and because they are the officially recognised areas\nfor sex work. However the other trend is that once there, they are emplazadas\n– located because of restrictions and discrimination. Moving out of those areas\nimplies a risk of violence. In this case, queer spaces do not just destabilise\nheteronormativity but reinforce it because of segregation and city planning.\n15 An extensive defence of his position about this was done in the opening event of an international\nevent on LGBT public policies held in Bogota in 2007. See Serrano (2008: 12).\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n31\nThe consideration of Chapinero as a gay district by politicians follows a similar\nheteronormative pattern but using different rules. What the Mayor did not\nmention is that most of those circuits are basically targeting gay men and\nfollow global trends of a gay market. According with the June 2010 edition of\nConXion, a gay map of Bogotá, in Chapinero 72 there are places for gay\nsocialisation including bars, discos, saunas, shops, restaurants and hotels. The\ncity´s first LGBT Community Centre was opened there in 2006. It has been\nbecause of this added commercial value to the presence of gay men that public\npresence is possible in that area of the city.\nHowever, it is important to mention that there are resistances to this\ncommodification of the presence of some actors included under the LGBT\nacronym. In a city with almost eight million inhabitants and highly segregated\nbecause of class conditions, other areas have their own circuits, not only of\ncommerce but also of public presence. Festivals, interventions in public\nspaces, and walks are some of the initiatives created by gender and sexual\ndiverse communities in working class areas to gain public recognition not just\nthrough commercial circuits. In 2010 an Itinerant LGBT Community Center was\nimplemented as part of the PPDLGBT with the intention to decentralise\nservices, to promote the visibility of LGBT people in localities and to support\nthe role of public servants in territories to implement the PPDLGBT. New\ngroups claim their belonging to their barrios and localities as a way to\nchallenge invisibility and the idea that gay topics are just for the wealthy areas.\n4.4 How does a policy like this acquire public value?\nDiscourses about diversity have been strategic for LGBT organisations and\nactivists to reposition themselves in the landscape of political subjects, in a\ncontext in which diversity, especially in cultural terms, has a significant value.\nThe PPDLGBG and its associated practices are full of a language of diversity.\nThe Office created to coordinate the policy is called Dirección de Diversidad\nSexual – Sexual Diversity Unit. The motto of the LGBT Community Centre is\n‘An encounter point with diversity’. Diversity is often an adjective associated\nwith the names of several LGBT organisations as well as a generic term often\nused in institutions to talk about LGBT persons and social sectors. ‘Bogotá,\nterritory for diversity’ was at the starting of the PPDLGBT a motto promoted by\nthe City Hall and the programmes in the current Development Plan of the City\nare under the title ‘Bogotá Diversa’. The City already has a circuit of Festivales\nde la Diversidad – Diversity Festivals all through the year. In them, gender and\nsexual diversity is celebrated using arts, performance, providing information\nabout LGBT services, activities and organisations. These festivals are an\nimportant opportunity to interact with communities and people not usually close\nto LGBT topics and to make public gender and sexual diversity at the level of\nlocalities and neighbourhoods.\nHowever, diversity discourses also have the risk of emptying political struggles\nbased on the expression of social inequities. When it is one of the most\ncommon used terms and even a euphemistic way to talk about lesbians, gays,\nbisexual or trans persons, diversity tends to acquire a blur meaning. Ward\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n32\n(2008: 15–17) in a study of diversity cultures in LGBT activist organisations\nfound that their appropriation of a discourse about diversity gives them the\nchance to be more competitive with other social organisations, to augment their\nreputation and moral value and to became experts in the topic.\nInstrumentalisation of diversity is part of neoliberal ways to understand\ndifference (ibid.). Considering this, it is not strange that the PPDLGBT was\ndeveloped in the midst of a turning toward neoliberal policies and insertion in\nglobal market at both national and city levels, in which representations of\nBogotá as multicultural, respectful of rights and promoter of diversity are\nproductive and useful.\nNon heterosexual sexualities and transgender identities are included in logic of\ndiversity promoted and recognised in the public sphere which normalises them.\nIf in the case studies by Ward (2008) normalisation is made mainly by the\ninsertion in the market, it could be said that in the case of Bogotá normalisation\nis made by the instrumentalisation of diversity in public policies. Because of\nthat the recognition of differences is erased in diversity policies when it is\ndefiant, difficult to organise or unpredictable (ibid.: 2). The risk faced by the\nPPDLGBT is that because of its emphasis on identity policies, recognition and\nindividual rights ended up in the creation of a ‘normal gay’ who does not\nchallenges heteronormativity (Seidman 2005: 59). Normalisation of gays means\na dissociation of them with the ‘bad sexual citizen’ (ibid.). In 2007 and 2008, at\nthe time of the formulation of the PPDLGBT, debates around sex in public and\n(hetero) swinger bars increased, leading to the shooting down of some of those\nplaces in Bogotá and the promotion of controlling national laws.16\nFraming their grievances into discourses of rights offered LGBT activists and\norganisations a useful vehicle for social transformation. However, in their focus\non law reforms and engagement with the state, Colombian LGBT activists have\nreproduced the ‘liberal myth of rights’ (Hunt 1990), leaving uncontested basic\nassumptions of those discourses. Current rights approaches in the country,\nespecially the ones used for subordinated social sectors are based on\npronouncements about ‘diversity’ and ‘plurality’ proclaimed in the 1991\nColombian Constitution (Zambrano 2004; Bonilla 2007). These notions were\ndeveloped under global politics of multiculturalism and State. The interactions\nbetween those regimes of multiculturalism, diversity and law restrict the\npossibilities for LGBT individuals to be subjects of rights other than under\ncertain official regimes of truth (for that concept: Blasius 2004).\n4.5 How did actors relate to a policy like this?\nA policy like this based much of its potential in the protagonist participation of\nthe LGBT organisations and activists. Participation in democracy was a right\nestablished by the 1991 Constitution and is a logic that structures current\ntendencies in public policies. Despite of the problems it can imply or the\n16 This debate can be traced in the electronic archives of El Tiempo, a national leading newspaper.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n33\ndifferent ways to understand it, participation is in one way or other almost a\ncondition in public policies. The city of Bogotá has not only a scheme of\npolicies to guarantee participation but also an institutional structure to promote\nit. According to that, participation is considered a pivotal tool to exercise\ndemocracy toward the construction of collective wellbeing (IDPAC 2007: 13).\nParticipation strengthens the relations between state and society through the\ninvolvement of citizens in the definition and deliberation of collective issues\n(ibid.: 14). As part of their rights based approach in social policies, city policies\nconsider participation not only a right but also a key mechanism to involve\ncitizens in the ruling of the city. Because of the exclusion faced by certain\nsocial sectors, strengthening their participation is fundamental to improve their\nlife conditions (ibid.).\nHowever, accounts on the benefits of participation have several normative\nassumptions (Cornwall and Coelho 2007: 5). One is the idea that citizens are\nready to participate once opportunities are offered (ibid.). This assumption is\nbased in another implicit one: people already consider themselves citizens and\nsubjects of rights. As I could see during my experience in the implementation of\nthe PPDLGBT, both assumptions create a paradox: in some cases, new spaces\nfor participation are empty because people still see themselves far from those\nmechanisms, while in others they are filled with the same people that could be\nseen in parallel processes of participation. The result is a tendency to have the\nsame voices adjusted to new spaces, while others ways in which people\nexpress their needs are not considered.\nThe previous case can happen to several different social actors: youth, women,\ncivic leaders. However, the participation of gender and sexual diverse people\nfaces specific challenges. One was mentioned before: gender and sexual\nminorities in contexts like the one I am considering have a long history of being\npositioned at the margins of citizenship. As human rights reports have found,\npeople have poor information about their rights and consider the experiences\nof discrimination and exclusion to be part of their life conditions. In this way,\none of the challenges they face is to relate with the state and institutions as\nsubjects of rights and not as outcast sectors. If participation implies that people\nrecognise themselves as citizens (Cornwall and Coelho 2007: 7) it also\nrequires visibility and voice from them. In order to participate, people should go\nthe spaces promoted by institutions and use the predefined mechanism for it.\nHowever, this is problematic in the case of gender and sexually diverse sectors\nor other sectors that have faced restrictions in their access to the public\nsphere. In the case of gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual people their\nvisibility in participatory spaces can imply risks for their own safety, as I have\nalready heard in the case of some participants in the PPDLGBT policy. When\nthey make themselves visible in their communities as representatives or\nparticipants of LGBT sectors they are exposed to discrimination, intimidation\nand exclusion. This risk for personal security can be experienced by other\ncommunity leaders and representatives, however with different effects at the\nlevel of intimacy, identity and private life. During the design and implementation\nof the PPDLGBT one of the strategies to face this situation was the use of\nchats and other electronic means which allow people to participate and give\nopinion without the risk of being exposed. However, these means are limited in\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n34\ntheir access and concentrated in certain populations with access and literacy to\nuse technologies.\nEven more, what is starting to appear now is a certain distance and weakening\nof the commitment of the LGBT movement because of an excess of\nmechanisms and spaces of participation. This can be caused by some aspects\nof the PPDLGBT itself such as the proliferation of spaces for participation that\ncannot be fulfilled by LGBT representatives, the moving of some LGBT leaders\nto the public sector as implementers of the PPDLGBT and a certain\ndepolitisation of the movement caused by the institutionalisation of its\ndemands.\nIn a context of reduction of the State and labour flexibilisation, some grassroot\norganisations became Non Governmental Organisations hired by public\ninstitutions to implement programmes and projects, which directly or indirectly\nleads to a partial colonisation of their agendas and a blurring of differences\nbetween civil society and state agents. This transfer of responsibility from State\nto private sector, civil society organisations or grassroot organisations has\nhappened all though the implementation of the PPDLGB and has been\nidentified in other countries in the region, such as Dagnino (2005) found in\nBrazil. That situation not only creates hierarchies amid civil society\norganisations but also makes the political landscape more confusing, ending up\nin new ways of State control of social mobilisations for change. This situation\nhas been already presented in gender and women’s policies where their\ninstitutionalisation favours their depolitisation (Cornwall and Molineux 2008).\nEven more, as I could see in the case of the PPDLGBT, when resources are\nlimited, the transfer of responsibilities and the transformation of community\norganisation into service providers can directly or indirectly increase tensions\nand conflict between civil society actors.\n5 Conclusion\nAll through this working paper I have tried to state how, in a context where\ndemands for rights and litigation are still nonviolent ways to promote social\nchange and justice, a public policy scheme like the PPDLGBT has a very\nimportant symbolic meaning. It entitled subordinated social sectors such as\ngender and sexual diverse people as subjects of rights. The PPDLGBT\nappears in a context where there are no ‘welfare states’ and where liberal\nrights democracies are far from being fully realised. They are part of the\nstruggles for creating certain idea of human dignity that sustains the project of\nnation expressed in the 1991 Constitution and in the social creativity to\novercome violence.\nHowever, according to the notion of ‘hybrid new democratic spaces’ I\nmentioned at the beginning (Cornwall and Coelho 2007), the description I have\ngiven raises several questions in terms of the autonomy of such a policy\nscheme and the effects of its interfaces with broader political processes. If we\nfollow Chambers’ (2007) ideas of how subversion works as a political project of\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n35\nerosion of power relations such as heteronormativity, it is not possible to\nconsider the PPDLGBT really subversive. Heteronormativity is such a powerful\nstructure and so embedded in social, political and cultural organisation that, as\nI have presented, it can adjust and reshape fast and in unexpected ways.\nPublic policies are so strongly tied to it that the possibilities for change they\nopen are limited. Even just their need for planning, calculation, measuring or\nanticipating of effects is contrary to politics of subversion which act as\nincalculable, non-programatic and ‘ungrounded politics of possibility’ (ibid.:\n661). However, as the same author says, incalculability does not mean\nunthinkable or indescribable. The case I have mentioned goes far from that\nsince it has already created some real changes in the lives of real people and\nparticular organisations.\nThe sense of collectivity on which the PPDLGBT is based is unstable and\nfictional but useful to connect actions. From the point of view of those\nimplementing policies, the instability of political subjects raises several\nquestions. The subjects referred in the PPDLGBT are not fixed or easy to\ndefine in stable categories, particularly in the case of bisexual or transgender\npeople, as Monro (2005) notes. In terms of design and evaluation of inter-\nventions, the difficulties of identifying the subjects of the PPDLGBT complicate\naspects such as the cost-benefit balance of actions or the measure of the\nimpacts and changes created. Another unclear aspect is the participation – or\nnot – of heterosexual people, especially in the services provided by the PPDL-\nGBT. In the evaluation of the first two years of the LGBT Community Centre,\nfor example, the participation of straight people in the activities offered in the\ncentre was a topic of vibrant discussions. In conversation with public\nemployees in charge of the implementation of the PPDLGBT policy the lack of\na message that involves straight people and informs them on how that policy\ncould be to their benefit has been a matter of discussion as well. Until now,\none of the arguments developed by LGBT activists and leaders is that these\nkinds of policies are part of the development of democracy and citizenship and\nin that way it is not just a ‘gift’ or privilege to certain social sector. Since LGBT\npeople have been representing themselves as ‘historically discriminated\nagainst’ the idea of certain particular conditions that differentiate them from\nothers supports the need of specific services.\nRegardless of the correctness or not of this argument, there is not yet a clear\nway in which non-conforming heterosexual or just straight people can feel part\nof the intended change promoted by the PPDLGBT. Creating a more inclusive\nand positive discourse about sexualities and gender identities which surpasses\nvictimisation and contestation to exclusion is, I think, one of the main\nchallenges of a initiative like the one currently implemented in Bogotá.\nThis last idea can be connected with the need to explore more what a rights\nbased policy means. As Cornwall and Molineaux (2008: 8) point out, rights in\nthemselves are not inherently transformative. It is not in the adscription but in\nthe ways they are used, in the kind of process they mobilise, that their trans-\nformative potential can be seen. Because the PPDLGBT is an action regulated\nby planning logics, implemented through bureaucracies and public institutions,\nthe transformations created do not have the subversive potential of other\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n36\nstrategies for change. In other words, there is not an automatic connection\nbetween a policy like this, as a ‘new democratic space’ and a ‘space for\nchange’, as several of the essays in the compilation done by Cornwall and\nCoelho (2007) explore. In fact, the description I have given until now should\nlead to a change in the title I initially used. Instead of asking if the PPDLGBT\nreshape or challenge heteronormativity, I should say that both movements are\nundertaken at the same time. Change toward justice and equity can run\nparallel to adjustments in institutionalisation of social relations and new\nexercises of authoritarian power.\nEven if it is not yet clear what a rights policy scheme for gender and sexual\ndiversity means, it can erode heteronormativity by keeping and developing that\nfocus on rights, social transformation and democracy. The PPDLGBT has a\npotency to promote change by questioning normative systems that not only\nexclude and discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer or transgender\npeople but also heterosexuals, in their own diversity. Making public policies in\nthe city to talk about gender and sexual diversity in a language of rights has an\nimpact that is not easy to measure yet but that is already promoting changes in\ninstitutions and in the way citizens relates with them.\nHowever, as I noted in the examples, a scheme like this can also reshape\nheteronormativity, especially when the inclusion of LGBT people as subjects of\npolicies is not contested or challenged. Because of its origin in the social\nmobilisation and in the work of activists, the PPDLGBT can establish a new\nregime of proper subjects, such as those who feel themselves compelled with\nidentity politics or those who follow the new model of the proper sexual citizen\ncreated against the improper queer subject (Warner 1999). In a context of\nglobalised sexual identities and homonormativity (Duggan 2004) already acting\nin the city landscape, this is a risk to be considered carefully. The fact that this\nscheme deviates from other traditional policies which invisibilise or even\nfacilitate discrimination against sexual minorities, does not necessary mean\nthat it transform normative systems.\nIdentity or visibility politics can be useful and strategic. Inclusion policies are\nimportant to reduce socioeconomic exclusion and to promote justice and\nequity. They can expand public agendas with topics previously ignored and\nfacilitate resources not easy to find. These kinds of policies are not in\nthemselves a problem but can be in the ways they become regulatory\npractices. As in the case of identity policies, recognition of diversity is not a\nproblem in itself but instrumentalisation of diversity can be. What needs to be\nchallenged is the notion of normativity behind them, the ‘conventional forms of\nassociation, belonging and identification’ (Halberstam quoted by Ward 2008:\n134), that those actions make valuable and legitimate. The promise of\nparticipation, extension of citizenship and deepening of democracy in a policy\nlike this, confluxes with the reconfiguration of the state, the shrinking of its\nresponsibilities and its exemption from its role as guarantor of rights (Dagnino\n2005: 158). That is why citizens and their organisations are now facing the\nneed to move their strategies for change from inclusion into policies to enable\ndifferent projects of inclusive citizenship that are not homogenic or normalising\nand that not only engage with the state but also with other social sectors and\nmobilisations.\nIDS WORKING PAPER 361\n37\nReferences\nAltman, Dennis (2001) Global Sex, Chicago and London: The University of\nChicago Press\nAzuero, Alejandra and Albarracín, Mauricio (2009) Activismo Judicial y\nDerechos de los LGBT en Colombia.

    "abstract": "On 28 December 2007 the then Mayor of Bogotá signed a Decree which established the guidelines of the public policy for the full guarantee of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in the city. This legal measure was the end point of a long lobbying and advocacy strategy implemented by activists and organisations working on gender and sexual diversity. This Working Paper presents that experience as part of the process in which subordinated social sectors, such as gender diverse and sexually diverse people make themselves political subjects. In spite of the novelty in Colombia and in Latin America of this kind of public policy targeting LGBT people as subjects of rights, it is also an opportunity for normative systems to readjust and to create new ways to normalise people. The promotion of certain queer people as proper citizens, the regulation of ways to interact with the state, the co-option of social mobilisations and the transformation of grassroots organisations into private service providers, are just some of the risks that a scheme like this faces. The author was part of the social mobilisation that motivated this particular public policy scheme in the early 2000s and was involved in its design, planning and initial implementation between 2007 and 2010. This paper is situated in a problematic position between political activism, consultancy work and construction of knowledge based on the practice. It is a contribution to the memory of a rich, and in many ways unique, experience",
