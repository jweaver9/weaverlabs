One of the main\nmotivations of these research projects is to promote the delicate balance between the\neffective social integration and the maintenance – or in some cases the achievement –\nof a self-identity of groups or persons by revealing and analysing pre-existing or\npossible sources of social conflicts. Conducting social scientific research on sexual\nminority media can be seen as part of this broader research stream.\nThe main goal of my research project was to provide a comparative overview of the\nfunctioning of sexual minority media in three European countries: my home country,\nHungary – where I have been conducting research on sexual minorities for some ten\nyears – depicted as one of the most homophobic countries of the region in the early\n1990s (cf. Inglehart et. al. 1996); the Netherlands, often perceived as being an\nexemplary society concerning social tolerance towards sexual minorities; and\nSlovenia, a model country of peaceful \"post-transitional\" modernisation in Central\nEurope.\nSexual minority media content is typically produced by sexual minority groups: mainly\ngays and lesbians. These minority groups usually share a common \"mainstream media\nfate\" with other relatively powerless – for example, ethnic – minority groups, which\ncan be characterised by low visibility and stereotypical representation. Therefore\nsexual minority media products can be seen as means of creating a symbolic\nenvironments where people belonging to these groups can feel at home (cf. Gross\n1991). It is also important to emphasise that the position of sexual minorities differs\nfrom that of \"traditional\" minorities in two aspects: they are usually not marked by\ntheir bodies – for example, by their skin colour –, thus they are not recognisable at first\nsight; and their existence challenges the \"natural order of things\", thus their media\nappearances can become problematic. Still, their media products can be perceived to\nbe documents of, as well as tools for promoting the successful social integration of\nrelatively powerless social groups, and – in some cases – struggling against social\nintolerance.\nHypothesis\nThe anticipated differences in the functioning and in the roles of sexual minority media\nin the three chosen countries reflect different social perception – and acceptance –\npatterns of sexual minorities by their societies as well as by themselves. The history,\nthe resource-management, and the main issues of these media products tell us a story\nof how certain - previously or presently - stigmatised social groups can create and use\ntheir media means to represent their interests. Here stigmatisation can be interpreted in\ngeneral as a social symptom reflecting the rejection of the right to be different – not\njust sexually, but also by belonging to a different ethnic, religious, political etc. group.\nIn this context my research can provide data to indicate the general \"difference-\ntolerating\" levels of the examined societies.\nApplied methods\nAfter examining the pre-existing theoretical background and consulting the\ninternational literature focusing on sexual minority media issues, I concentrated on\nsexual minority media products and their creators as well as the social environment of\nsexual minorities reflected by the legal system and the existing findings about social\nattitudes towards them.\nThe empirical part of my project was based on qualitative research, mainly\ninterviewing and archive research. I have conducted interviews with individuals\nworking – or who used to work – in sexual minority media production and\nrepresentatives of organisations promoting the publication of these products. My\nintention was to find interviewees who can be characterised by a certain – preferably a\nhigh – level of active involvement in sexual minority production. Altogether 25\ninterviews were collected: 10 from Hungary, 6 from the Netherlands and 9 from\nSlovenia.1 In Slovenia all of my interviews were conducted in person. In Hungary 3\ninterviews were conducted by telephone, 7 in person. I could conduct only one Dutch\ninterview in person, the others were made via e-mail.\nThe main points of the interviews covered the social context and the history of sexual\nminority media of the given country, the description of their network of support and\nresource-management, their main goals and grievances. Archive research meant\nmaking use of local information centres – primarily the Dutch Homodok, and the home\narchive of the Hungarian Mások magazine – in order to describe the variety and the\nprofile of sexual minority media products.\nIn Hungary and in Slovenia I was able to cover –almost –the whole scope of sexual\nminority media, while in the Netherlands I had to narrow down my focus mainly to the\nprinted press (because of the relative abundance of sexual minority media products). In\nthe Netherlands my main source of information included published and unpublished\nstudies and other material (collected in the Homodok), and my interviewees provided\nme with additional, illustrative information. On the other hand, in the two other\ncountries the interviewees – including almost all of the main actors of sexual minority\nmedia creation2 – provided me with the substantial part of the necessary information.\nConsequently, qualitative data gained from my interviews can be seen as much more\n\"representative\" in the cases of Hungary and Slovenia, than in the case of the\nNetherlands.3\n                                               \n1 Interviews were conducted with Tatjana Greif, Roman Kuhar, Bostjan Lajovic, Bogdan Lesnik, Ales\nPecnik, Tadej Reissner, Natasa Sukic, Miran Sulinc, Suzana Tratnik (Slovenia); Péter Ambrus,\nGábor Bencze, János Kerekes, Gyula Kroutil, László Láner, László Mocsonaki, Sándor Opovszki,\nBalázs Pálfi, Judit Rózsa, Bea Sándor, Sándor Steigler, Gábor Sz\u0000 cs, László Török (Hungary); Denis\nBouwen, Remco van Dam, Adri van Esch, Gert Hekma, Christiaan Swart, Dennis van der Veur (the\nNetherlands). In fact, one of my \"Dutch respondents\" (Denis Bouwen) is actually Belgian, living in\nAntwerp and working for the Dutch Gay Krant as a free-lance contributor as well as being the\neditor-in-chief of the Flemish Het Maagnet. He also gave me insight into the state of development of\nsexual minority media in Belgium.\nI would like to thank all the interviewees for their cooperation. I would also like to thank Judith Schuyf\nfor her observations and advice.\n2 During my Slovenian fieldwork I was not able to interview Brane Mozetic, one of the central figures\nof the Slovenian GLBT movement. However, he sent me an interview he gave to Kinoeye in 2001\nwhich I was able to use (cf. Pozun 2001).\n3 Here I use \"representative\" in the sense that in Hungary and in Slovenia I succeeded in gathering\ninformation personally from the main actors, while in the Netherlands I was able to attract the\nThis difference in methodology can also indicate the different levels of sexual minority\nmedia infrastructure in the Netherlands on the one hand, and in the two other countries\non the other hand. In the Netherlands there are already books4 and studies written\nabout this topic (though not too many), while in Hungary and in Slovenia there are\nvery few – if any – publications available in this field.5 It is important to note that in\nthe two transitional countries there are very few original publications available about\nhomosexuality, the lives of gays and lesbians or the history of GLBT movements in\ngeneral.6\nAs it will turn out from my findings, there are methodologically comparable findings\ngained from Hungary and Slovenia where my main points of references were my\ninterviewees. The Netherlands was treated as a model: perhaps it is not a\nmisinterpretation to see 'the Dutch example' as a possible future model for the other\ntwo countries.\nFindings\nIn this part of my paper I will present my findings gained from the comparison\nbetween the examined countries based on the analyses of their sexual minority media\nproduction. This examination also aims to reflect the different social situation of sexual\nminority groups and the ways how they articulate their interests, their rights to be\nachieved and oppose discriminative acts in their society.\nThis project is about sexual minority media. In order to be able to make relevant\nstatements about the subject I had to start with examining the terminology, especially\nthe meanings of the terms sexual minority and sexual minority media.\n• definition of sexual minority\nBefore starting my research, it seemed to be a smart idea to dedicate this project to\nsexual minority media research. Originally I chose to use the term sexual minority\nbecause of practical considerations: to reflect a – maybe very Hungarian – model of\ngay and lesbian activism which has as one of its main goals \"to persuade authorities to\ndefine gays and lesbians as a minority group, and thus to ensure funding for their\nprojects\".7 However, in the course of conducting my research sometimes I ran into\ndifficulties with using this term. For some of my respondents sexual minority seemed\nto be an \"empty term\", not really being in use, for some others it seemed to have a too\nbroad scope to include groups which should not be included (such as pedophiles). I am\ncertain that everyone understood what I meant by sexual minorities as a typical\nreaction of my respondents was to say \"do you mean gays and lesbian, don't you?\".\nHowever, I could also sense differences in interpreting the possible meanings of sexual\n                                                                                                                                       \nattention of only a few people with active (past or present) involvement in sexual minority media\ncreation.\n4 See, for example, Schedler et. al. (1989)\n5 In Hungary three articles can be mentioned: one was written about the Hungarian gay magazine\nMások: (cf.  Takács 1993), and two short ones were written by gay journalists (cf. Láner 1997, Pálfi\n1997).\n6 Among the few  exceptions we can mention a Hungarian (cf. Tóth 1994) and a Slovenian book (cf.\nKuhar 2001).\n7 Equality for Lesbians and Gay Men. A Relevant Issue in the EU Accession Process. A Report by\nILGA-Europe, Brussels 2001. Chapter 5: Hungary (by Bea Sándor). p.34.\nminority. For example, one Dutch respondent expressed a certain level of discontent:\nthis minority word implies ... powerlessness ... I'd rather speak about LGBT people or\ncommunity (DV, NL). 8\nIn general we can say that sexual minority groups or sexual minorities were decoded in\nthe interviews as holebi (in Dutch: homo's, lesbiennes, biseksuelen) or in Slovenia as\nLe-ge-bi-tra (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender) or in Hungary as MLBT (GLBT).\nHowever, there were some more inclusive – all-inclusive? – definitions given, too:\nEveryone who engages in sexual practices of the minority. Assuming that the masses\ngo up and down in heterosexual pairs, than this includes anybody who does not do\nthat: transsexuals, homosexuals, sadomasochists, partner swapping, fetishers,\npedophiles, etc. (RD, NL)\nAnyone who does not conform to the traditions of how people should behave sexually,\nso, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transvestites, transsexuals, maybe very unorthodox\nheterosexuals, why not? (AP, SI)\nAnyone who might be oppressed by the sexual 'moral' majority. (CS, NL)\nDifficulties to define the term sexual minority seemed to have different sources in the\nNetherlands and in the two other countries. In fact, in the Netherlands the use of sexual\nminority (sexuele minderheid – in Dutch) does not seem to make too much sense.\nMinority can be seen as a useful – political – concept in a society or in a phase of\nsocio-cultural, historical development when/where non-conventional sexual interests\nhave discriminative consequences. In places where normative heterosexuality is losing\nits social organising power  sexual habits, interests, orientation based identities are not\nforced to develop, or at least not likely to develop into threatened identities.\nHere we can refer to theories of social identity and social representation as the broader\nframework of analysis. These theories emphasise the social contsructedness of social\nreality, which is represented by social representations constructed in social interaction\nprocesses (cf. Moscovici 1976).  The common sense content of social representations\nreflect the ways in which individuals and groups interpret reality, and these reality\ninterpretations serve as a base for building up individual and group identities. The\ninteraction of social representations and identities is a central feature of Breakwell's\ntheory on identity processes: in order to understand identity threats – hindering the\neffective functioning of identity processes – and strategies applied to cope with these\nthreats it is necessary to examine social representations (being synonymous with social\nbeliefs and social attributions). Breakwell emphasised the importance of those factors\nwhich can endanger the basic principles of identity processes (i.e.  assimilation-\naccommodation and evaluation). Therefore in the case of developing threatened\nidentities the distinctiveness and the continuity of one's identity, one's self-esteem or in\nsome cases one's desire for autonomy can be threatened (cf. Breakwell 1986:23).\nIf we interpreted, for example, same-sex desire or non-conventional sexuality as\npossible bases for developing threatened identities, the social representation of\nhomosexuality plays a very important part in this process. From previous research\nfindings it turns out that the social category of homosexuality gains its identity\n                                               \n8 When quoting from interviews the first letters refer to the initials of the respondent, followed by a\ncountry indicator: SI or NL or H\nconstructing capacity mainly from the negative contents of the social representation of\nhomosexuality, which negative contents appear as identity threats (cf. Takács 2002).\nIn this context homosexual identity seems to be much more a social fiction produced\nby social discrimination than one of the main supporting pillars of individual self-\nidentity.\nIn comparison with the Netherlands, Slovenia and Hungary can be characterised by\nmore threats to cope with when realising one's non-conventional sexuality. Therefore\nin these places the political concept of minority can be applied when trying to create a\nmore tolerant, identity threat free social environment for people with same-sex or non-\nconventional sexual desires and experiences, developing – sometimes changing or\nfluid – identities based on these desires and experiences.\nThough my Slovenian and Hungarian respondents realised that the term minorities\nusually referred to ethnic or national minorities in their countries, they also recognised\nthe equal rights opportunities and anti-discriminative guarantees that can be gained by\napplying the minority concept to gays, lesbians, and other non-heterosexuals.\nHowever, the usage of the minority concept has several disadvantages, too. It does not\nonly imply the acknowledgement of the relative powerlessness of the social group in\nquestion but it also has to operate with fixed – identity – categories (as if anyone could\ncome up with \"the correct\" definition of being gay, lesbian, transgender etc.).\nLet's have a look at some examples reflecting the ambiguity of using the minority term\n(and concept):\n... did you notice, when you speak about minorities, usually it's about ethnic minorities.\nIn some countries, in Hungary and also around Hungary, there are programmes for\nminorities or minority councils. They never include a gay or lesbian person or a\ndisabled person. It would be interesting to extend it much more, to other minorities, I\nfeel, and to learn from each other. (DV, NL)\nIt is always hard to define who belongs to a sexual minority. Usually we are talking\nabout gays and lesbians, but then there are bisexuals as well, and transsexuals and\ntransvestites. Transvestites are often not considered a sexual minority. ... It is always\nthe question where to set a border. Now we are living in times of fluid identities.  ... we\nhave an Ombudsman and he considers gays and lesbians as a minority which should\nbe protected. ... (RK, SI)\nWell, sexual minority when I first heard it, it was a bit funny. Here in Yugoslavia we\nare always talking about national minorities, like in Slovenia there is an Italian or a\nHungarian national minority... and I think, sexual minority is something else,\nsomething more flexible and it is also a very broad term. For me it is gays and lesbians\nand transsexuals and transgender persons and even women can sometimes be a sexual\nminority (ST, SI)\nWe are hoping that it [sexual orientation] will be included [in the antidiscrimination\npolicy] after all. But this is simply so embarrassing for them [the policy makers]. It is\nvery easy to write down that minority refers to national and ethnic minorities in\ngeneral. Nowadays age and disability start to appear too – but sexual orientation only\nvery rarely ... It is very hard to define who counts as a sexual minority. But it exists\nhere after all. Because here this sexual identity issue is not really challenged, not like\nin Western-Europe in the 1960s, 70s ... in certain ways this identification thing\nhappens now: that we are gay and we have to come out, that we should become visible\n... (SB, HU)\nAfter the system change in Hungary a minority law was created which listed exactly\nwho should be counted as minority. From this time on it became the norm. But it\nexcluded not only sexual minorities but also a lot of other minority groups ... From this\naspect sexual minorities are in a strange position because they are not too often\nmentioned at all, and if they are mentioned, it is done in a discriminative way. ...\npeople having or struggling for or wanting to do something with gay identities or non-\nheterosexual identities belong to this group. Also bisexuals, though we don't speak\nabout them too much – and transgender, transsexual people, transvestites and people\nwith changing identities, too. Their social visibility is very relative – relative to that of\nhomosexual men. This used to be the case with lesbians, too, but nowadays they are\nstarting to present themselves as an independent entity. (PB, HU)\nInterestingly, the point that some sort of normative framework was formed within\nsexual minorities was echoed in a different way by another Hungarian respondent:\nThe question is ... how to define what healthy means and what illness is. And from this\npoint on the category of illness is distanced from us. ... we do the same as society in\ngeneral. There is this sexual minority, a GLBT community –but it is not a coincidence\nthat we do not use this sexual minority too often because it brings up problems with\ndefinition: because what should we do with the 'bad ones', with pedophiles or whoever,\npeople having sex with dead ones. Thus we rather use GLBT community. (ML, HU)\nAt this point I have to admit that there are several problems with using the sexual\nminority terminology. This term reflects a practical political strategy to gain equal\nrights and – at least temporary – shelter from discrimination, and naturally it makes\nmore sense in a social context where there are still a lot of things to fight for. Thus it is\nprobably not a coincidence that the sexual minority concept was most often referred to\nin Hungary where the anti-discrimination policy makers are still not sure whether to\ninclude explicitly the forbidding of sexual orientation based discrimination into the\nnew law (and where the discriminative age of consent for homosexual relationships\nwas abolished only in September 2002). The minority concept still makes sense,\nthough not very often used, in Slovenia where the antidiscrimination policy exists – at\nleast on paper, as some of my Slovenian respondents pointed out with discontent – and\nexplicitly includes sexual orientation. However, for example, there are no legal\nframeworks for same-sex cohabitation. Probably for Dutch people the term sexual\nminority sounds quite strange – and perhaps a bit empty – because it is lacking the\npolitical connotations that Hungarians and Slovenians are still quite familiar with.\n• definition of sexual minority media\nThe first question of my interviews was about the definition of sexual minority media.\nI was interested in the aspects that make this media different from other type of media.\nThough the definition of sexual minority raised quite a few theoretical problems – as\nwe could see, – here the answers referred to actual media products and practical\nexperiences.\nThe most typical answer for this question was that sexual minority media is made for\nand by members of sexual minorities.\nThere is definitely a difference between mainstream programmes that pay attention to\ngay and lesbian issues and separate LGBT sexual minority media ... made by and for\ngay and lesbian people. ... It is important because it is good to look through the eyes of\na gay person, or a lesbian person, how we observe the world around us. (DV, NL)\nWe are dealing strictly with the question of social exclusion, in connection with sexual\nminorities, especially about GLBT population in all senses. So it means we are dealing\nwith political aspects, social aspects, and with cultural aspects of the GLBT population\nin general and also we are dealing with some other depriviledged groups. We are very\nwell connected with disabled people in Slovenia and with others, so we are also\ndealing with refugee questions sometimes, but in the main we are focussed especially\non GLBT issues. ... I believe it is important [that gays and lesbians create it], because\nwe have experience on a daily basis, so it means we know what discrimination is like\nin every day life. (NS, SI)\nIt focuses on issues connected to this existing group which cannot really be defined ...\nit is not an essential thing who makes it, but it is characteristic that it is more\nimportant for us (SB, HU)\nMost respondents pointed out the importance of sexual minority media being created\nby sexual minorities not only because of their special perspective but also because of\nthe special language they have to use:\nIt is a special language we use. We have a special lifestyle, and only we know what our\nneeds are. We have special jokes. (MS, SI)\nOn the other hand, different opinions were also expressed in connection to media\ncreators:\nIt is not a necessity that only GLBT people can make GLBT media. What is important\nis being able to identify with them, to understand their situation. Of course, it helps if\nyou are gay, but on the other hand I don't think that just because you are gay you are\nable to create good quality gay media. (ML, HU)\n... when you write from a gay or lesbian or feminist standpoint, you have a localised\nknowledge and you write from within. According to my experience, it is mainly gay\nand lesbian people, but there were always some straight people who had some\nimportant contributions, who wanted to say something, then if it is a good issue, of\ncourse, it is good, because it also brings some diversity into perspective. (ST, SI)\nSome respondents also emphasised that sexual minority media should have a broader\ntarget group than \"only\" GLBT audiences:\nIt is not good if it is only for gays and lesbians, it should be open, much more open –\nthat was one of my motives that we should treat gay people as any other type of people\nso they should have an opportunity to express their opinions on the national radio, and\nalso I don't believe that it should be very narrow, they should be open, they should talk\nabout everything, about sports, music, anything. (BLa, SI)\nObviously it was to make a quality type of magazine or journal, that would bring the\nrelevant topics for gays and lesbians as well as for other people. It (Revolver) did\ntarget the general audience as well. I am not sure that it can be seen in it, but the idea\nwas that it should be one of the cultural journals that was available at the time. So it\nwas not targeting only the gay and lesbian audience although it did have almost\nexclusively gay and lesbian teams. (BLe, SI)\nFor me this is a symbolic space where, by assuming one's own identity one can\ncommunicate with people who are interested, irrespective of their sexual identity. For\nme it is very important that I am making my programme not only for gays but also for\nstraights, for the majority members of society. In my view, it is a very important\nfunction of gay media to integrate gays into society instead of building up walls of\nghettos. (PB, HU)\nIn summary, if we want to define sexual minority media in general then it seems to be\nan important expectation concerning the creators and the target group that they belong\nto sexual minorities. In specific cases definitions can vary. For example, a Slovenian\nrespondent described their paper in the following way:\nWe do take care that each issue can be shown to parents. Not to say that it is sterile\n(but parentproof?) Yes, that's a very good word. But we do not specifically target\nparents even though we do sometimes ask parents to write about their experiences as a\nparent of a gay person. Our prototype target person is a teenage boy or girl who is\nstill coming to terms with his or her sexuality... (TR, SI)\nAccording to a Hungarian respondent: A magazine cannot do everything, an\norganisation can do more. But if there is a gay or lesbian magazine that is for gays or\nlesbians, then we shouldn't expect it to target other publics [like the general public].\n(SB, HU).\nFrom my findings it also turned out that while respondents speak in general about gay\nand lesbian, or GLBT media, in practice – especially when examining the printed press\n– gays and lesbians seem to prefer establishing their own specialised media. At present\nin the three countries I could find only one publication (the Legebitrina Oznanila in\nSlovenia) that was for mixed audiences. Specialisation can be seen as an indicator of\ndevelopment. In the Netherlands most printed GLBT media products are specialised.\nIn Slovenia there is one mixed publication and one mainly lesbian magazine. In\nHungary the only gay magazine targeted lesbians, too when it started,  but it has now\nbecome – according to its editors – \"98% gay\". However, for example, the Slovenian\nRevolver was founded and produced by gays and lesbians together. One of the\nfounders of Revolver explained it in the following way:\nThis is mainly done, when it has been done, for practical reasons. Because it is\nobviously easier to make one magazine than two. This was only a practical matter\nwhich lasted as long as Revolver lasted. Immediately afterwards, or even before\nRevolver stopped coming out, Lesbo was founded, an exclusively lesbian journal, and\non the other hand Kekec, which was a kind of newspaper for young gays, they were\nexclusive. This has practical reasons, gays and lesbians together, as well as of course,\npolitical, because you can then somehow concentrate on addressing the authorities\ntogether. (BLe, SI)\n• main functions of sexual minority media\nFunctions of media products can vary according to their specific goals, missions, target\ngroups and creators as well as their social contexts. As one of my Slovenian\nrespondents emphasised:\nI do not think there is a list of tasks the media should fulfil, I think this question should\nbe asked analytically, in the sense that, for example: 'how was it in this case?', because\nin general I do not think anything is necessary. ... We can say that it depends on the\nactual situation in a country or a place, legal and social situation, attitudes towards\nhomosexuality. ... It obviously has a different function when a community is growing,\nthan when it is already well established. When it is already well established it has a\nmore commercial function. Also ideologically it produces something: styles, values,\netc. (BLe, SI)\nProbably the most \"stable\" function of sexual minority media is the information\nfunction. It is stable in the sense that the importance of this function seems to be\nindependent from changing socio-cultural contexts. While the importance of other\nfunctions – such as community building, helping people in their coming out process or\nentertaining them – can change according to the changing social environment.\nIf we look through the answers given about the main functions of sexual minority\nmedia we can sense difference between the \"western\" and \"non-western\" approaches.\nFirst, let's have a look at some Dutch answers, where the scope of  sexual minority\nmedia is more extended, including issues of activism or emancipation as well as those\nof entertainment and promoting certain lifestyles and – even artistic – trends:\nInforming about developments in the gay community, both concerning news\n(politics,health, culture, religion and such) and lifestyle (fashion, products, trends).\n(AE, NL)\nFunctions: distribution of information on emancipation matters, associative life,\nopportunities for going out, GLBT festivals, enhancing political and social awareness\nFuture: I am afraid that, as gays and lesbians get more and more emancipated, the\nemphasis in their media (if they continue to exist) will shift to entertainment and life-\nstyle (an evolution which I would deplore but, hey, who am I? ...) (DB, NL-B)\nThe first thing that comes to my mind about the function is basically for young people\nwho are in the process of coming out to get more or less objective information from\nsexual minority media themselves to form their opinion, to identify. ... That is what I\nsee a lot around me. There are so many examples in countries where there is no\npositive identification, role models and so on. The other thing is ... mainstreaming\nLGBT from sexual minority media in terms of making people acquainted with what is\ngoing on in our circles. ... To be honest, most media is about fun, entertainment, sex,\nlove, drugs, rock and roll. Of course, in our magazine, which was XL, and now there\nwill be another one, there will be attention for activism, because it is basically our own\nwork to promote it. (DV, NL)\nTo spread gay info and produce gay visibility-producing relevant specific info,\nbuilding group identity (and criticising this), entertain. Info on anything from\nmovement and politics to recreation, sex and health. ... In the future it could be more\nabout pleasure, art and style than about politics and movement. (GH, NL)\nIn Slovenia and in Hungary we can find the dissemination of information, the\npromotion of – both individual and group – identity formation as well as community\nbuilding among the most important functions:9\nTo promote the self-respect of gays. To see this in its natural way, in its beauty, not as\nbeing immoral, or a queer oddity, a curiosity. (LL, HU – gay magazine)\nThe most important function is to inform ... and the community organising force (SS,\nHU – internet portal)\nWhen I was able to accept myself, I thought that I should let other people know about\nthat feeling, too. The primary function is to help people to accept themselves. Beside\nthis: to spread information that cannot be gained in other places. It is also important\nto introduce life models, because socialisation is not about how to live as a gay. For\nthis reason we try to invite gay couples. ... Our goal is to demolish stereotypical\napproaches. Thus we try to provide information about everyday people, for example,\nabout a gay couple, about feelings, not just about sex. ... If they get a bit closer, it is\neasier to understand the situation. (SZG, HU – internet radio)\nWithin the community it has a great self-assuring function: providing a positive image\nof the self – not illness, not crime. (ML, HU – GLBT organisation)\nFor people from the countryside it is important that they get something each month\nthat makes them feel that they belong somewhere ... programme offers ...\nconsciousness raising by making propaganda for conscious lesbianism and feminism\n(RJ, HU – lesbian newsletter)\nIt has a kind of bridging function: trying to help gays to come out and let straight\npeople know that gays are the same people as they are. (AP, HU – community radio)\nTo have a dialogue, to promote social integration and the acceptance or social\nembededness of gayness or homosexuality. (PB, HU – public radio)\nThe mission is to disseminate information which is very useful for GLBT people, and\nfor people in general, the mission is to analyse our situation, the mission is\nconsciousness raising of GLBT people, the mission is GLBT visibility in wider society.\nWe can also mention the promotion of positive role models, exposing stereotypes, and\ncombating discrimination, these are all interconnected. (NS, SI – lesbian magazine)\nThe main function is that they should keep telling to the so-called normal people that\nthey exist. Normal people should know every day from different media, they should get\nthe message: we are here, we are people like you are so we should live together (BLa,\nSI – public radio)\nTo help them to be part of the community. ... To find a gay identity, to help them to\nsocialise, to contribute to the common objectives. (MR, SI – former gay magazine)\n                                               \n9 In this section I also indicated the type of media product.\nI think the most important function is spreading information because when we give this\nmagazine to women for a lot of them this is the way to find out what's going on.\nBecause they are not there, or they don't live here (in Ljubljana) or they are not\nactivists. The other thing is to build a sense of community somehow, a lesbian\ncommunity. It is also important for consciousness raising because you see there is\nsomething written, it is material, it is history, it is important ... To see that there is a\ndiversity of lesbians, there are many ways to be lesbian, that lesbians are everywhere\n(ST, SI – lesbian magazine)\nI think a very important element is informing the people who have not yet come out of\nthe closet. That's a very important thing and any newspaper needs to have a section\ndedicated to these people. ... I am convinced, in the more remote areas away from the\nbig cities people are still not using the internet enough. So we need to reach out to\nthese people through a gay newspaper and that is definitely one function. The other\nobvious function is to inform the gay community of events taking place and also to\nprovide an avenue for members of the gay community to communicate between each\nother directly or indirectly through the media. Basically connecting various parts of\nthe gay community with the interested public. (TR, SI – GLBT youth newspaper)\nThe mission is to provide the target population and the general population in Slovenia\nas well with information. Additionally we must address consciousness raising,\npromotion of human rights, equal rights, equal opportunities, LGBT culture, art,\neverything which is connected with the status of the LGBT population in the given\ncountry. ... and promotion of equal rights and equal opportunities for gay and lesbian\npeople who mostly think that it is their own fault that they are being discriminated, but\nit is not, society is responsible as such.(TG, SI – lesbian magazine)\n• activism\nFrom the findings it is quite clear that there is a strong connection between GLBT\nactivism and sexual minority media production, though this connection seems to be\nstronger in Slovenia and Hungary than in the Netherlands. This difference can be\nexplained mainly by the different social contexts (which will be examined in detail\nlater) and consequently the different life strategies of GLBT people in the three\ncountries. Activism can provide the background for sexual minority media production:\n\"While many groups and interests are ignored or distorted in the media, not all have\nthe same options for resistance. The opportunities for opposition are greatest when\nthere is a visible and organised group that can provide solidarity and institutional\nsupport for the production and distribution of alternative messages.\" (Gross 2001:19).\nSeveral years ago I wrote a study about the role of gay media in articulating the social\nexpectations of homosexual communities (cf. Takács 1994), in which I compared the\nDutch and the Hungarian situations. As I saw it, in the Netherlands homosexuality was\nnot approached as a social problem to be \"solved\", therefore activists could pay more\nattention to specific issues such as same-sex marriage and adoption, instead of\nfocusing on media creation. On the other hand, in Hungary, homosexuality as an issue\npresented in the general political arena was quite unthinkable so media creation as a\nmobilising force seemed to be an important target. In the article I emphasised the\npossible interaction between media in general and the meaning management of the\nsocio-political issue of homosexuality. On the one hand, there are social groups\nconcerned with the formation of a socio-political issue (in our case the 'homosexuality\nissue' i.e. introducing the problems of homosexual people into the political agenda), on\nthe other hand there are media – both competing for the attention of society. Media can\nmobilise messages, but they can also control the meanings by suggesting priorities for\nthe general public as well as for politicians (cf. McQuail 1987). Unfortunately, in a lot\nof cases mass media are unable to mediate the special needs and claims of GLBT\npeople (cf. Pierce 1973), therefore special media segments must be created by the\nconcerned groups in order to provide their constituencies with positive reference points\nfor identity formation. The main issue of gay media politics was, and still is in a lot of\nplaces, whether these social groups are able to undo the rigid framework of the\nnormality concept in their society and make or claim space for themselves in social\nreality.\nOn the basis of the present findings we can state that GLBT activism still plays an\nimportant role in several sexual minority media organs. Though in the Netherlands it\nhas somewhat become a thing of the past:\nIn general they play an important role in terms of identity, information and contacts. I\ndo fear that there is hardly any GLBT youth activism left in this country (the\nNetherlands) unless they are obscure squatters' groups. In these the media only have a\nminimal role. Youth is more focused on going out, sex and fashion (I fear). I get this\nimpression when I look at ExpresZo. (RD, NL)\nThese media can strongly enhance the togetherness of GLBT groups and support the\nmovement in its struggle. I must admit, quite recently I started to doubt about the\n'reality' of a (true) gay and lesbian community. Maybe it's more of an ideal than a hard\nfact. Parts of the GLBT media seem to want to forget about equal opportunities and\nfocus on life-style, having a good time, going out etc. (also to get more advertising\nincome, for example). (DB, NL-B)\nIf you are an activist, you speak up, and out. If you are an activist, you are keen to\nspread your word. Naturally alternative or minority media are always instigated by\nactivists, who can also 'make things happen'. If this is generally true, then it must also\nbe so for GLBT. I suspect it is. (CS, NL)\nInterestingly, the same phenomenon – i.e. becoming less activism oriented – can be\ndiscerned in the course of Mások's, the Hungarian gay magazine's 12 year history:\nAt the beginning we really had to come up for our own interests ... in each situation we\nhad to find lawyers or journalists who could help ... we had to issue appeals to the\nConstitutional Court against discriminatory laws ... we had to organise events to be\nable to write about them ... but today we have experts for almost everything, for\nexample, we have specialised organisations providing legal aid ... the situation is now\nmore comfortable as we can report on events without having to organise them first ...\nat the beginning it was an activist's journal, rough, confronting, and militant – but who\nneeds this nowadays? So Mások became a more readable, more entertaining magazine\nwith short stories and amusement. Well, it is entertaining – but the market rule dictates\nthat (LL & BG, HU)\nIn contrast, in present day Slovenian sexual minority media GLBT activism is still a\nsignificant – if not the most significant – motivating force.\nIt is also interesting to observe the predictions about the future. According to some\nrespondents, both in Slovenia and in Hungary, the ideal end game would be that sexual\nminority media would no longer be necessary as an autonomous entity, the mainstream\nmedia would encompass the various sexual minority media products, thus nullifying\nthe distinction between sexual minorities and the majority:\nIt would be ideal, if at one point it would not be necessary to have separate gay media\nbut it would become a part of media ... these separate media islands are there because\notherwise who the hell would talk about these things (ML, HU)\nMy wish is for my radio programme to be finished. (SZG, HU)\nIn an ideal case, it would not have any functions. It should not exist. Or it would exist\nonly to the extent that homosexuality is perceived as a problem in a country or region.\n(PB, HU)\nI guess the informative function will stay the same. Coming out and identity problems\nwill remain, unless we are talking about the future maybe one hundred years from now\nwhen perhaps it will not matter whether you are gay or hetero or these sexual\nidentities will be pretty much irrelevant. (Are you hoping for that?) I am fighting for\nthat. I think the main goal is reducing the importance of whether you are gay or\nstraight. (RK, SI)\n• evaluation of the situation of sexual minorities\nIn order to evaluate the situation of sexual minorities in a country we have to take\nseveral – social, cultural, legal etc. – factors into consideration. Here I will focus on the\nlegal factors – including laws covering sexual activity, anti-discriminatory legislation\nand partnership recognition –, the history of the GLBT movement and, of course, the\nviews of my respondents.\nThis is probably the best point to see why I like to refer to the Netherlands as a model\ncountry. In the Netherlands there are no anti-gay or anti-lesbian provisions in the Penal\nCode. The age of consent is 16 years for heterosexual as well as for same-sex\nrelationships. Though it is not explicitly mentioned in the Dutch constitution, sexual\norientation is covered under Article 1 of the Constitution. In 1983 the previous\nconstitution, which was in operation from 1815, was replaced by a new one. According\nto Article 1 of the new Constitution: \"All persons in the Netherlands shall be treated\nequally in equal circumstances. Discrimination on the grounds of religion, belief,\npolitical opinion, race or sex or any grounds whatsoever shall not be permitted.\"\nwhere \"any grounds whatsoever\" includes sexual orientation, too (cf. Waaaldijk 1987).\nThe General Equal Treatment Act has been in force since 1994 prohibiting\ndiscrimination on grounds of their race, religion, personal beliefs, their sex or their\nhetero- or homosexual orientation, and defining it as an offence against public order.10\nDutch laws enabling same-sex partners to marry and adopt children have been in\noperation since April 1, 2001.\nIn the Netherlands the first decriminalisation of homosexuality – i.e. abolishing laws\npenalising sodomy – occurred in 1811 (cf. Tielman 1982). Sexual acts between\n                                               \n10 Cf. http://ruljis.leidenuniv.nl/user/cwaaldij/www/NHR/tranl-anti-discr.htm\nconsenting adults of the same-sex were allowed until 1940 when, with the start of the\nGerman occupation, all sexual conducts between men became illegal again. In the\nmeanwhile between 1911 and 1940 homosexual contacts between adults and minors\n(people younger than 21) were penalised again. This criminalisation of same-sex\nrelationships affected both men and women (cf. Schuyf 1987). Finally, in 1971,\nhomosexuality was decriminalised, when it became \"generally accepted that\nhomosexual 'seduction' was not possible after the age of 16\" (Tielman 1987:13).\nThe Dutch Scientific Humanitarian Committee (NWHK), the first organisation in the\nNetherlands dedicated to accomplishing political and social equality for homosexual\nmen and women, was founded in 1911. The first – homosexuality oriented – periodical\nLevensrecht (Right to Live) was established just before the second world war. In 1946\nthe editors of this periodical became the founding members of the Cultural and\nRecreational Centre, the COC, which became the national Dutch organisation fighting\nagainst the social oppression of homosexuality (cf. Tielman 1987). In 1971 the first\n\"separatist lesbian movement\", the short lived Lavender September was established\n(cf. Schuyf 1987). From 1973 COC is officially recognised and subsidised by the\nDutch state. From 1977 centres for the study of homosexuality appeared in Dutch\nuniversities.\nTo explain these quite unique developments I would like to refer to two factors. The\nfirst one is a scientific one: it seems that in Dutch research on homosexuality there was\nmore attention paid to the social reaction to homosexuality (discrimination) than to\nhomosexuality itself. In the Netherlands from the late 1970's scientific approaches\n\"began shifting from homosexuality as a sexual deviation to homosexuality as an\nexpression of sexuality which, to a greater or lesser extent, has socially discriminating\nconsequences\" (Naerssen 1987). Dutch researchers of homosexuality, from the very\nbeginning, focused more on \"the causes of, and the possible ways to change\ndiscrimination\", than on, for example, subcultural lifestyles. The second factor is a\nsocial one: it seems that \"pillarization\",11 the unique development pattern of Dutch\nsociety, provided a special tolerant environment, not only for people with different\nreligious and cultural backgrounds, but also for people with \"non-conventional\" sexual\ninterests. As a Dutch researcher pointed out: \"The integration of homosexuals into\nDutch society has been facilitated by the fact that Dutch society is subdivided into a\nrelatively large number of political and religious groups, divisions, which can be\nencountered in all fields of public life.\" (Naerssen 1987:4).\nIn Slovenia homosexual acts between consenting adults already became decriminalised\nduring \"Yugoslav times\", in 1976. The age of consent is the same for heterosexual and\nsame-sex relationships (14 years). The Slovenian constitution prohibits discrimination\ngrounded on sexual orientation only implicitly: under the heading of \"other personal\ncircumstances\". However, there is anti-discriminatory legislation explicitly referring to\nsexual orientation (Article 141 of the Slovenian Penal Code).12 On the other hand,\nthere is no legal framework established for same-sex cohabitation or partnership.\n                                               \n11 \"pillarization\" (verzuiling) = \"the splitting up of society into socially separated denominational\nsectors, each taking care of his own social, state-subventioned provisions (education, mass media,\nhospitals, housing, and so forth). This pillarization profoundly affected Dutch society in such a way\nthat socio-political majorities could subsequently exist only through coalition of minorities, all of\nwhich wanted to be as autonomous as possible.\" (Tielman 1987:10)\n12 Equality for Lesbians and Gay Men. A Relevant Issue in the EU Accession Process. A Report by\nILGA-Europe, Brussels 2001. Chapter 12: Slovenia (by Tatjana Greif) p.69.\nSlovenia was the first country in the \"non-western\" part of Europe to see, in 1984, the\nestablishment of a homosexual organisation, Magnus. In 1988 LL (Lesbian Lilit) the\nfirst Slovenian lesbian organisation was founded.13 Gayzine, the first gay media\npublication, appeared as early as 1985. Revolver, the most influential gay and lesbian\nmagazine of the region, was published between 1990 and 1997.\nIn Hungary homosexual acts between consenting adults became decriminalised in\n1961, but a discriminative legal differentiation between the ages of consent in\nheterosexual and same-sex relationships remained in operation until September, 2002.\nThere is no general anti-discrimination policy in Hungary defending people from\nsexual orientation based discrimination. Though Hungary has national laws prohibiting\ndiscrimination, such as the Constitution, the Law of Labour, and the Law of Health\nCare, only the latter explicitly prohibits sexual orientation-based discrimination. In all\nother cases, the question whether sexual orientation is included under the heading\n\"other situations\" – usually ending the list of discriminatory forms based on \"race,\ncolour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin,\ncircumstances of wealth and birth\",14 – is a matter for interpretation. Same-sex\npartnership has been legalised since 1996 (though it is closer to \"common law\nmarriage\" than to registered partnership): \"It is a factual legal relationship, which\ncomes into existence without official registration; thus it has underlying problems of\nproof\".15\nThe first Hungarian homosexual organisation (Homeros) was established in 1988. The\nfirst independent lesbian organisation, Labrisz was founded in 1999. In 1989 the first\nunofficial issue of the only Hungarian gay magazine, Mások came out, which was\nfollowed by the official establishment of the magazine in 1991.\nIf we compare how the different respondents evaluate the situation of sexual minorities\nin their country, we can see that the Dutch answers reflect a much more developed\nsituation than the others. The Dutch seem to be content with their achievements,\nthough they can also sense certain lack of acceptance. As one Dutch respondent\npointed out: it is still a straight culture where gays and sexual minorities are tolerated,\nbut not a full-fledged [\"volwaardig\"= full-fledged, proper, legitimate] part of societal\nfunctioning (GH, NL). At the same time some might also agree with one opinion\naccording to which they are \"spoilt in a way\". Certainly, they have to face different\nproblems than Slovenians and Hungarians: such as dealing with the attitudes of\nimmigrants.\nQuite satisfactory. On a legal basis all is as good as done. Yet there are still negative\nexcesses, for example in secondary schools and in the churches. ... The Netherlands is\nthe first country in the world to have opened civil marriage to couples of the same\ngender. There is extensive anti-discrimination legislation. ... Homosexuality is a great\nproblem among ethnic immigrants and their descendants. A good and constant\ndialogue must be established between ethnic and gay organisations. (AE, NL)\n                                               \n13 History of Gay and Lesbian Movement in Slovenia cf. Slovenian Queer Resources Directory.\nhttp://www.kud_fp.si/siqrd/history.php\n14 Hungarian Constitution, 70/A §\n15 Equality for Lesbians and Gay Men. A Relevant Issue in the EU Accession Process. A Report by\nILGA-Europe, Brussels 2001. Chapter 5: Hungary (by Bea Sándor). p.30.\nFor homosexuals, it is not ideal, but O.K. It is harder for transsexuals, harder still for\npedophiles. (RD, NL)\nProblematic. ... [positive things:] Legal near-equality (opening marriage for gays and\nlesbians, no specific mention of homosexuality in criminal law etc.). Equal rights is not\nthe same as equal access to public space that remains defined by straight. [negative\nthings:] The level of social discrimination and violence. This discrimination should be\ntargeted by the relevant authorities (schools, police, cities etc.). They are slow to\nenhance the visibility and safety of sexual minority groups. (GH, NL)\nUsually it is not a big issue. My neighbours in Amsterdam know that I am gay, that I\nlive with my boyfriend, it is not really an issue, it is not a problem. But it easily leads\nto indifference in a way and of course, it is different when you live in the countryside.\n... Dutch people I think, are sometimes a little bit proud that we have a very high\nprofile on gay and lesbian issues. Whenever I work with Dutch embassies abroad, they\nare always extremely helpful to help me in my work. And they are even used sometimes\nas a way to distinguish themselves as embassies from other embassies. ... And that is\nreally the biggest difference I see with any other embassy, there are no other countries\nthat dare to take a high profile with this. But that does say something, because they do\nrepresent the whole Dutch society. ... What we certainly miss in gay and lesbian\ncircles, we take things for granted, we are spoilt in a way. (DV, NL)\nThe situation is quite good at the moment, I would say. Gay and lesbian couples can\nenter into an officially registered partnership. Their legal position when it comes to\ninheritance taxes etc. was improved (less discriminatory treatment vis-à-vis straight\nmarried couples). Belgium's federal government promised to open marriage to\nhomosexual couples, but changing the law has been stalled because of some\nopposition or, better, manoeuvres to delay this change. It will come soon, I guess\n(probably in 2003, before the next national elections). Awareness is bigger in the\nDutch speaking part of Belgium. ... In general gays and lesbians are quite well\naccepted by large parts of the population. ... Obviously there will always be a group of\npeople that don't like 'us' very much. Marriage has still to be opened. Political\nopinions on allowing homosexual couples to adopt children can be quite different (no\nconsensus in the federal - Belgian - government at the moment). An extreme right-wing\nparty as the Vlaams Blok [Flemish Block] doesn't like homosexuals too much and\nopposes full equality. Homosexuality also remains a controversial topic in parts of the\n(Islamic immigrant) community and for conservative Catholics/Christians. (DB, in this\ncase referring only to Belgium)\nSlovenian and Hungarian answers reflect more discontent concerning especially the\nlevel of GLBT emancipation. However, their perception of the situation is not\ncompletely negative. Let's have a look at some Slovenian views first:\nOn the positive, the legislation is quite O.K. The problem is that this legislation is a\ndead letter on paper. For example, when we had outbursts of intolerance, hatespeech\nand so on, we tried to prosecute someone for it and it was decided by the Prosecutor\nGeneral that it was not a crime, that hatespeech itself was not a crime. (AP, SI)\n... in theory they are treated equally but in practise they are not. ... Legal\ndiscrimination we cannot talk about, but social discrimination is quite rampant. If you\nask normal Slovenes if they want to have a neighbour who is gay they would say no! I\nbelieve that Slovenian people are quite homophobic ... the Catholic church, they have\na big influence on public opinion in connection with issues like prostitution, sexual\nminorities etc.  ... The good thing is the legal system which is equal for everybody. The\nbad things are that they are not so active, not so visible. They should really grab their\nopportunity, they should start working. (BLa, SI)\nWe are still not visible enough. Things are changing and this year we made a big step\nforward, but we are still too invisible. ... There is still a lot of work to do. They are\nignoring us. ... You can translate this as hate silence. Small town mentality. ... We don't\nhave a well-organised infrastructure. (MS, SI)\nThe bad thing is, we are constantly repeating it, that Slovenia is a small country, two\nmillion people in total. So there is a small gay and lesbian community. That's one part.\n... It is not common to get a lot of support from the masses. So in that sense it was quite\na wonder that we already had two Gay Prides. ... What is positive, is that we have had\na left-wing government for more than ten years, with the exception of some four or five\nmonths. In 1990 they signed a special declaration: 'The Right to be Different'. The\nmajority of parties that are now in the government or in the parliament signed this\nstatement saying that Slovenia will support gays and lesbians and everyone has the\nright to be different. In that sense we have some kind of support from the government,\nbut then nothing happens. We have this theoretical support, homosexuality is not\nprohibited here, we can live our homosexual lives, but when it comes to action, to\ndeeds, there is a problem. (RK, SI)\n... in 1991 in the new constitution there was this article forbidding discrimination but\nsexual orientation is not explicitly there. We wanted to write that everyone is equal\nirrespective of sexual orientation, and they did not want to write that in, they said no,\nno, it is irrespective of personal circumstances or something like that. It is implicitly\nwritten ... the argument of the politics was no, no, we should not write that, people are\nnot ready. That is what they say all the time: people are not ready, the public is not\nready, they are never ready. But in fact it means that politicians are not ready. ... I am\nnot especially interested in marriage but partners should be able to make\narrangements, because now they really cannot. For example, now if one partner dies,\nhis family can make claims because you are nobody, you are not a relative, and\nusually you lose a lot of money. It would be very practical to prevent this somehow and\nhave security. (ST, SI)\n... on the political level, we are just as oppressed, because there is the problem of\nsilence in the political circles about the big issues like adoption, like marriage,\nregistered partnerships which is like a step down from marriage, and things like\ninheritance or insuring your partner, things like that are just being ignored on the\npolitical level. We have asked the government direct questions about this and on more\nthan one occasion we were just completely ignored. ... I think the homophobia is there,\nit is just not visible. ... I think there is a high tolerance threshold of the Slovenian\npublic in general, they just do not get involved up to a certain point. But when this\nthreshold is reached, they will make up for all of the silence with loud protests usually\nabout God and family. ... [the catholic church is influential] in too many areas of\neveryday life. ... it is a very powerful control mechanism, especially in the countryside\nwhere the peer pressure is most important. It comes out really strong. Every Sunday\npeople are being brainwashed by members of the clergy who preach sermons on which\nparty to vote for, even though this is strictly prohibited by law. It is a breech of the pre-\nelection silence. But they still do it because they are not a political organisation as\nsuch. I think it has a huge influence and I think the strongest weapon against it is\nprolonged exposure to liberal ideas. (TR, SI)\nThe negative aspect is ... that the legislation is not developed enough. It does not\nprotect the GLBT population in a proper way. ... On the positive side, the GLBT\nmovement started some twenty years ago, it is quite well developed in the Slovenian\ncapital, Ljubljana, there is a fairly well developed GLBT infrastructure, unfortunately,\nthere is nothing in other cities. (NS, SI)\nI cannot really complain. Of course, we do not have the resources we would like to\nhave, we could have,  if we were maybe better organised in a sense. On the other hand\nwe are much better off than anything in the East. In this respect we are really in the\nmiddle between East and West. ... homophobia is just a normal experience for a gay\nman, maybe even more so than for a lesbian in one sense ... Homophobia does not\ncome isolated. I think it comes in a pack together with some other manifestations of\nhatred. And I think what is underneath it basically is hypocrisy. This is really a very\nhypocritical country, hypocritical culture I should say. ... We could start quoting\nreasons, historical, sociological reasons, one tentative answer just for discussion is\nthat it is a small country in which everyone knows everybody. ... If you want to achieve\nsomething you have to go against persons you know. ... This causes false, devious\nstrategies, strategies that take as a basis the hiding of your purposes, your intentions:\nthe displaying of those that are expected, that are publicly acceptable and so on. This\nalso has to do with the fear of being rejected. You are so easily rejected in such a\nprogramme and everybody knows you and then you do something or ask something\nthat is unacceptable and you get rejected. Social control is terrible. You can not just\nmove to an other place, you have to live with it. (Ble, SI)\nI think we have a lack of education, starting with schools, and a lack of all kinds of\nstate supported programmes which would fight against all kinds of intolerance in\nsociety like other countries have, like Scandinavian countries and countries which\ndeveloped action programmes and activities with regard to eliminating or combating\ndiscrimination. ... I think that there is a bad influence of the Roman Catholic tradition\nhere in Slovenia. Not that we have so many active churchgoers. According to statistics\n80% are catholic, but not all those are active, just baptised people. The ideology and\nCatholic thinking is influential and the message people get from the Roman Catholic\nchurch hierarchy in Slovenia is against all alternative lifestyles ... This is the other\nnegative factor which blocks the development of tolerance and culture in general. ...\nSlovenia is very confused in a way, because basically we have better legislation than\nmost EU member countries, leaving aside registered partnership which have not been\nlegalised. ... These are the good things but the problem is that people are still afraid to\nmake use of these laws. (TG, SI)\nAs we could see the key words of my respondents in their evaluation of the Slovenian\nsituation included: relatively good legislation, which is poorly applied; decreasing\nlegal discrimination, still existing social discrimination; \"hate silence\" on the part of\nsociety, ignorance by political actors, but supportive left-wing governments believing\n– at least theoretically – in \"the right to be different\"; small country \"syndrome\"\nsometimes supplemented with small-town mentality, hypocrisy, negative influence of\nthe Catholic church; relatively well developed GLBT infrastructure – but only in the\ncapital.\nThe Hungarian answers included the following views:\nYear by year we go on with small steps. On the gay pride marches I always try to talk\nwith straights and they seem to become more and more tolerant. ... Naturally, there\nare still a lot of things to do to achieve that this topic could appear not only in soap\noperas but also as part of normal everyday talks. (SZG, HU)\nWe were just talking about it which direction should the Hungarian gay movement\ntake. Should we aim for marriage? Or adoption should be a target, too. ... Marriage is\nimportant because same-sex couples should have the same rights as a cohabiting\nheterosexual couple ... we have to try increasing social acceptance, that of the older\ngeneration especially, because as I see it, it is much more well received by younger\npeople (OS, HU)\nIt is a mixed situation.  I am already in a situation where everyone knows it about me, I\nam working with it, I dare to put these writings into my CV ... and I have a big circle of\nfriends, and there are places and organisations ... and I am afraid a lot of people have\nthis kind of misperception that they forget that there are people for whom it is not so\neasy. I am aware of the it but still sometimes I am really shocked (SB, HU)\nIt is not only policy making what matters, but also the practical application of laws\n((law enforcement?)), the way how this is influenced by prejudices. ... once legal\nemancipation is realised, you can hear voices saying \"I can't understand this\nhysterical reaction. We are not discriminating anyone.\" It is more difficult to tackle\nsocial discrimination than legal discrimination. ... We grew up in homophobia, in\nhating ourselves. Things change slowly. By now there are better quality places where\nyou can meet others. Gays are no longer locked into the world of cruising areas, bath\nhouses and public toilets. Nowadays they are \"allowed\" to visit the gay bars, situated\nin the basements of side-streets. A lot of people have peace with this situation: at night\nI run around the five gay bars, there are gay discos, I can go to a private party\norganised in the countryside. But it is still that level very close to practical sexuality,\nan instinctual level ... it is like masturbating ... but to live together with another man,\nto integrate this into my everyday life? That is too much yet. It is still under the\nsurface. ... This is opportunism. From a radical queer perspective we can call this sly\nopportunism ... It is still hiding. It is not a real life, not a full one. It is a crippled life.\n(ML, HU)\nPeople's way of thinking – that should be changed and that is hard to change. Now\ncomes the small-scale tiring work. (PB, HU)\nWhen one is a member of a minority group, one has to accept certain things ... I am\nnot a fighter ... Still, in my view there is some sort of comfort already, it is not so\ndangerous anymore, there is no \"which hunt\" against us any longer (KJ, HU)\nThe situation is improving, thanks to those who are working and fighting for it. ... It is\nimportant that there are more and more media programmes about homosexuality.\nThere are foreign reports on gay prides, marriages ... so people can see that it is not a\nproblem in other parts of the world (TL, HU)\nIn comparison with the Slovenian views, the Hungarian answers seem to be somewhat\nmore positive or hopeful, which was a bit of a surprise for me. This might be explained\nby the fact that at least in the field of legal emancipation Slovenians achieved more and\ndid that sooner than Hungarians. Therefore Hungarians might get used to a relatively\nslower development. Also Slovenians might feel more like \"westerners\" and prefer to\ncompare their own situation to Western countries, while for a lot of Hungarians it is\nstill hard to make sense of their \"piggy in the middle\", \"neither eastern- nor western-\nEuropean\" positions when trying to find reference points for evaluating their own\nsituation.\nIn both societies we can witness the functioning of identity politics. GLBT people,\nespecially gays and lesbians, are still \"organising and trying to manifest an identity and\na lifestyle publicly\" (Bech 1993). Identity politics is a system-specific concept: it can\nhardly be interpreted in anti-democratic political systems characterised by the\nextensive erosion of private identities, the rigid and forced separation of public and\nprivate identities. The \"natural\" context of identity politics is civil society, the field of\nsocial self-organisation, being the framework as well as the guarantee of modern\nidentity formations (cf. Er s 1994). The different levels of civil society development\ncan also explain the different self-perception of the Slovenian and Hungarian\nrespondents. In Slovenia civil society initiatives appeared already in the 1980s, while\nin Hungary involvement in civil activities still counts as a relatively new – and not at\nall wide-spread – experience. A Hungarian respondent described this situation in the\nfollowing way:\nThe self-organisation of this [GLBT] community is also a process of consciousness\nraising. For this an outside pressure is necessary: the experience of being excluded\nand stigmatised brings people together. But there is something else in present day\nHungarian reality. People now start to take their life into their hands, they start to feel\nthat in certain ways they can indeed have a say in the development of their own lives.\n(ML, HU)\n• general overview (and the main actors) of sexual minority media\nComparing sexual minority products in the three examined countries can be begun\nwith a simple quantitative comparison. If we have a short overview of the printed press\npart of sexual minority media, we can realise that in the Netherlands there are many\nmore publications available than in the other two countries. Also in the Netherlands\nthere is a much longer history of publishing gay and lesbian magazines regularly. For\nexample, the Gay Krant has a 23 year long history:\n23 years ago the Gay Krant was the first to appear. It was started as a joke. It turned\nout that the paper met a demand and quickly grew to be a trend setting medium. The\npaper took an active part toward several milestones, like the legalisation of civil\nmarriage for same-sex partners. At the moment there are more GLBT periodicals in\nthe Netherlands including a glossy and a youth magazine. ... The Gay Krant is with its\n110 000 readers (circulation almost 30 000 copies) the largest gay paper of the\nNetherlands and Belgium. The founder and editor of the Gay Krant, Henk Krol, has\nplayed a very significant role in the realisation of gay emancipation in the\nNetherlands. A lot of our staff could still be called activists, although we do try to\nreport objectively and to the point about what concerns the gay community, both in the\nNetherlands and in Belgium, and also in Europe and the rest of the world. (AE, NL)\nAs I have already mentioned, in the Dutch sexual minority media I focussed only on\nthe printed press which included the following publications:\nthe expresZO (no-budget glossy for lesbian, gay and bisexual youngsters, having its\n14th volume),\nthe Gay Krant (the oldest – and we can probably say \"the leading\" – gay\nmagazine/newspaper in the Netherlands, established 23 years ago) ... magazine,\ngeneral info very male oriented, conservative (RD, NL),\nthe (Dutch-English) bilingual Gay News (having its 11th volume), the also (Dutch-\nEnglish) bilingual Gay and Night (gay magazine from the Netherlands and Belgium,\nfounded in 1997) ... free monthlies in Amsterdam, owned by bordello owners who want\nto advertise gay Amsterdam for tourists and locals (GH, NL), magazines mainly\nfocussed on clubbing and fashion for men (RD, NL)\ntwo relatively freshly established fanzines: the Butt – Fag Mag (founded in 2001) and\nits female counterpart, the Kutt – Dyke Zine (founded in 2002) – queer/art, popular\nin the alternative scene (GH, NL),\nthe La Vita (a magazine for lesbian and bisexual women, having its 2nd volume),\nthe glossy sQqueeze (founded in 1996),\nthe Zij aan zij, lesbian magazine (in its 11th volume),\nand the XL, the magazine of the COC, the Dutch national gay and lesbian association,\nwhich had 11 volumes altogether (as its publication ended in the summer of 2002).\nBesides these printed media products there is a gay and lesbian radio programme on\nthe national radio (Roze Rijk) and a local radio and television station for gays lesbians\nbased in Amsterdam (MV/S). In the past there were numerous radio programmes on\nsmaller radio stations. Given the high density of cable networks in the Netherlands it is\nquite probable that there are initiatives similar to MV/S in other cities. There are\nseveral GLBT internet portals, too.16\nIn Slovenia there are only two printed publications, the Lesbo (established in 1996, re-\nestablished in 2001) and the Legebitrina Oznanila (founded in 1999 as the\ninformation bulletin of Legebitra, the first Slovenian youth organization established in\n1998). Both Lesbo and Oznanila are free and not available to the general public. The\nfirst sexual minority publication, Gayzine came out in 1985 and was followed by\nLesbozine, the bulletins of Roza klub (a political association founded in 1990),\nRevolver, Pandora, and Keke(c). There is one radio programme (broadcast by a non-\ncommercial independent radio) called Lesbomania and one very informative\n(unofficial) internet portal, the Slovenian Queer Resources Directory. In the past\n(between November 1991 and June 1992) Roza Val was broadcasted by the Slovenian\npublic radio. Revolver was probably the most influential Slovenian sexual minority\nmedia product: it was published between 1990 and 1997 and distributed in Slovenia as\nwell as in Croatia.\nIn Hungary – besides two newsletters of gay and lesbian organisations, which are not\navailable publicly – there is only one gay magazine, Mások (founded in 1989,\nofficially published from 1991). There is also an advertisement leaflet-like monthly\npublication, called Na végre! 100% GAY (published from 2001 by the owner of a gay\nfitness centre). In 1997-98 four issues of the lesbian Labrisz zine were published.\nThere are four Hungarian GLBT radio programs: the Önazonos (broadcast from 1995\non the national radio), Pararádió (from 1997 on a non-profit internet radio),\n                                               \n16 The exact information is outside the scope of the present study.\nSzappanopera helyett (from 1998 on a non-profit alternative radio, during 2001-2002\navailable only on the internet), Ki más?! (broadcast from 1997 on a non-profit\ncommunity radio). There are two main GLBT internet portals: the gay.hu (from 1996)\nand the pride.hu (the \"first Hungarian gay portal\", an officially registered internet\nportal, established in 2001).\nBy looking through the sexual minority media choice offered by the three countries,\nwe can see that in the Netherlands there is the largest range of  – and probably the most\nspecialised – printed GLBT media products. Among the three countries GLBT\ntelevision programmes are made only in the Netherlands. Hungary has a fair range of\nGLBT radio programmes. It is important to note that producing radio programmes can\nbe very cost-effective compared with publishing, printing costs on the one hand and\ntelevision programme producing costs on the other hand. Slovenia is the only country\nwhere there are only free printed GLBT products which reflects a conscious political\ndecision from the side of the media creators. In the other countries there are also free\nmagazines available but these are business ventures, gaining income from\nadvertisements. In Slovenia the main problem with free magazines seemed to be\ndistribution: the fact that they are not available publicly (for example, at newspaper\nstands) narrows down the number of people they can reach.\nIn the Netherlands GLBT printed press is produced by lesbians and gays respectively:\nthere are more GLBT products targeting specifically gay men than lesbian women but\nthere are several lesbian publications, too. At the first sight concerning the present\nsituation Slovenian lesbians seem to be more active media producers than Slovenian\ngays or even Hungarian lesbians. In fact, Hungarian lesbians are quite active in\npublishing but at a certain point when they were granted a substantial amount of\nmoney by an American foundation (ASTRAEA), they decided to start publishing a\nbook series instead of starting a \"proper\" magazine. There were attempts to establish a\nHungarian lesbian magazine in 1997-98, but after four issues these stopped. Therefore\nnowadays Labrisz, the only independent Hungarian lesbian organisation (established\nofficially in 1999) regularly publishes a minimum budget (photocopied) newsletter\nprimarily to inform their members and a book series (on lesbian themes). In the past,\nduring the seven years of publishing Revolver, Slovenian gays and lesbian were able to\nwork together quite effectively. This was never the case in Hungary. Though in theory\nMások was – is – open to lesbians, in practice it became an almost exclusively gay\nmagazine, made almost exclusively by gay men. Therefore on the basis of these we\ncan emphasise again that specialised publication seems to be an indicator of\ndevelopment, or at least the preference of GLBT media producers.17\nFinally, it is interesting to mention why the Slovenian Revolver and the Hungarian\nMások got their names. The choice of names in these cases reflected certain\n\"messages\". According to one of the founders of Revolver their message was quite\nradical:\nthere are some what we call revolver medium, a tabloid. ... That was part of it. It was\nmeant to be penetrating ... (A weapon in your hand?) Yes, yes, yes, it meant to be\npenetrating, to penetrate through all the obstacles and also it was subtitled 'a\nmagazine with a homosexual bullet' or something like that. It sounded better in\nSlovenian than in English. (BLe, SI)\n                                               \n17 For more details see also the definition of sexual minority media section.\nThe editors of Mások mentioned that if they were to start a gay magazine today, they\nwould choose a different name. But at the very end of the 1980s and the very\nbeginning of the 1990s Mások (\"Others\") seemed to be the right choice:\nNowadays people have a very different approach to this than then. It became a part of\neveryday life that gays exist in the world, too. But when we started, it was a completely\ndifferent world. During the last ten years the situation changed so much that there is\nno reason to choose such a name now. If we would look for a new name for the\nmagazine, I am sure that we would not call it \"others\" because it has a totally different\nmeaning now. At that time it meant that we had to assume our identity, but nowadays it\nrather suggests separation. So this is a very different world now. (BG, HU)\n• perceptions of the official media policy\nWhen I asked my respondents whether they think that their country's official media\npolicy is \"sexual minority media friendly\". Most views about \"sexual minority media\nfriendliness\" I received from Slovenia, where Article 8 of the Mass Media Act (2001)\nis about the prohibition of incitement to inequality, which can also be applied to sexual\nminorities, at least in theory: \"The dissemination of programming that encourages\nnational, racial, religious, sexual or any other inequality, or violence and war, or incites\nnational, racial, religious, sexual or any other hatred and intolerance shall be\nprohibited.\" 18\nIn the Ethics Code of RTV Slovenija (the Slovenia national radio and television)19\nthere is also a special clause about the portrayal of sexual minorities, which represents\n– in my view – an exemplary treatment of these issues. Consequently,  – as certain\ninstitutional frameworks were being provided – I could sense a certain level of\nawareness of their rights to correct media portrayal in the Slovenian answers:\nWe have some trouble with stereotypes about GLBT people. Sensationalism is very\nstrong in the media. They publish photos and write articles for instance about gay\npride parades all around the world, because they can show some people wearing\ncostumes and so on. Sensationalism, populism, such kinds of images, one-sided\nrepresentation, so, too much entertainment (NS, SI)\nIn those media there are always articles which are looking for sensation. We are never\nintroduced in a proper way. If they make an article they will always put some strange\npicture in as well, they never talk about normal gay people. ... some magazines are still\nignoring us, because we are not such an important issue in society, but from some\nmedia we have a good response. (MS, SI)\nI would say that journalists, generally speaking, are open to the topic. Maybe they are\n                                               \n18 The English text of the Mass Media Act was provided by the Peace Institute.\n19 “Homosexual people can be particularly subject to thoughtless and offensive stereotyping. These\nstereotypes might be even consolidated if programmes allow offensive assumptions or\ngeneralisations, while the approach of truthful portrayal might help to change them. In portraying\nsexuality, we have to avoid simplification, stereotypes and personal judgement. Homosexual\nrelationships should be portrayed accurately and impartially as compared to heterosexual\nrelationships. Be sensitive to the effect of language. We must not confuse homosexuality with\ntransvestitism or trans-sexualism.” Radio Televizija Slovenija – Professional Standards and Ethical\nPrinciples of Journalism in Programmes of the RTV Slovenija. Ljubljana, 2000.\nopen to it because it is still, in a way, exotic. ... just a few weeks ago, there was this\npiece on television, on a commercial channel, in a show called Extra, a show built on\nsensation. They were secretly filming what was going during the night in a park where\nthe cruising area is, and the journalist presented himself as the one searching for sex.\nIt was terrible, all these dark shots, you could only see the legs of people, you know, I\ncall this homosexuality without a face. It was typical of the seventies here in Slovenia.\nUsually, if I think about pictures in magazines or in newspapers, there were pictures\ntaken from behind, no face, or through a tunnel, just a silhouette of two girls or two\nmen. ... Sexualisation of homosexuality is still very much present. I remember this\narticle from 1995 ... the article was actually about human rights questions and gay\nrights questions, but then the pictures were pornographic, there was a picture of oral\nsex. ... So, generally speaking friendly and supportive, certain kinds of media, there\nare newspapers that would not cover that kind of thing, or would not be too eager to\ncover it. You can send an invitation to a press conference and usually the beginners\ncome, homosexuality, that is one of my conclusions I would say, is a topic for\nbeginners, just like the questions of drugs and alcoholism, something that is not\nserious enough for a journalist with a name and a reputation. This is because\nhomosexuality is understood as sexuality only, not as a question of rights or as a\npolitical question. (RK, SI)\nI still think that there is only very little media coverage that I would say, is really good.\nIt is a lot of sensationalism. Sometimes I really cannot believe it when they make some\narticles or writings because they are just the same as 15 years ago: the same\nquestions, like now it is an interview with a lesbian, a woman who loves a woman, and\nthey always ask if \"there is a chance that you will ever be with a man again\", it is a\nvery often asked question, and then if the woman says, \"I don't know, maybe, I don't\ncare\" then the headline reads: \"lesbian may fall in love with a man\", and this is an\narticle about lesbianism (ST, SI)\nI would not say that it is friendly. There are some individual journalists who are more\neducated and more open to LGBT issues, but generally they all report very\nsuperficially, they don't go into depth and mainly they are interested in personal\nstories, in negative experiences, in scandals, in sensational news, gossip, all more\nsuitable for tabloids (TG, SI)\nIf you had asked me this question before the Sestre scandal, I would have said that the\nmedia generally do write favourably about gay issues. ... The scandal was that men,\ndressed up as women would represent the national colours, now that was outrageous.\nThe public sees men dressed up as women all the time in comedy shows, or in\nentertainment evening shows. They think that is the place to put them, but once they\nare forced to cheer for these freaks, that's a very touchy subject. Again I am surprised\nat the actual level of homophobia in my country. (TR, SI)\nAccording to the Hungarian respondents Hungarian media policy is \"neutral\" about\nsexual minorities. Some of them pointed out that recently there are more and more\ntelevision programs (especially American style Hungarian talk-shows) about same-sex\nrelationships, which – like it or not – can be very important in influencing the general\npublic in a positive way.\nThe tabloid media has a relatively positive attitude towards this topic, but on the other\nhand they won't restrict themselves if there is a good story ... For example, on the gay\npride march among the 3000 who march 85%  are totally ordinary people, and about\n15% are very spectacular, feminine, transvestite, and the like – and what will be shown\non the evening news program? These latter ones. I know that they have to sell their\nmagazine and they won't sell it by showing an ordinary guy – it is easier with a\nscandalous transvestite... (KJ, HU)\nNot very surprisingly, Dutch respondents seemed to be relatively content with their\nmedia policy situation:\nThe past few years the mainstream media (newspapers, television) have started\nextensive coverage of news around the gay community. Much of it was positive and\nopen. (AE, NL)\nNeutral. There is little or no censorship (only in the case of pedophile pornography).\nOn the other hand there is no official financial support (which I can understand as it is\nno longer quite so necessary any more). (RD, NL)\nGay media are a normal part of the media landscape, but rather marginal. Sometimes\nthe general media pick up news from Gay Krant. (GH, NL)\n• attitude of the general public towards sexual minority media\nBecause of the limited scope of sexual minority media it is very hard to make\nassumptions about the attitudes of the general public towards sexual minority media in\nSlovenia. Therefore we cannot say that, for example, Lesbo has a great influence on\nthe general public, but according to Lesbo's creators in a limited circle it can have\npositive effects.\nA member of parliament asked : 'does your magazine still exist? Oh, send me a copy\nplease'. And the students of course. Several publics which are more open minded and\naware. If you go to some villages and ask there, they probably won't be. (TG, SI)\nIn the last issue of Lesbo we published interviews with Slovenian presidential\ncandidates. It means they take us very seriously, because they give us interviews. It is\nobvious that they take us pretty seriously. Also the mayor of the city reads the\nmagazine and some people in parliament. They don't think that Lesbo is unimportant.\n(NS, SI)\nAccording to a Slovenian journalist, if the general public would know these media\nproducts, they would be hostile, at least at the beginning:\nTheir attitude would be hostile at the beginning but I believe that it should be a long\nprocess. After a few years of publishing a magazine like Revolver, maybe the general\nopinion would also become different. (Blo, SI)\nSurprised, somewhat hostile reactions at the beginning, getting used to it at the end –\nthis was the experience of a Hungarian radio program maker:\nThe big surprise is over, they can accept it by and large ... When it started, it was a big\nissue: should it be allowed? is it really necessary? Nowadays it is very rare that they\nquestion the reason for its existence. They got used to it. They don't like it but they got\nused to it. ... Some political circles, from the right wing, they were very much against\nit. (PB, HU)\nOne Hungarian internet creator mentioned a positive example:\nBecause of the tone we use, because we do not publish sex pictures and sexual content,\nstraight people also like to visit our portal ... we receive letters from straight people,\nthat they like the portal and that they were surprised about it, because people strongly\nhave the stereotype that if it has something to do with gays then it is dominated by sex.\n(SS, HU)\nStill, the general experience of Slovenian and Hungarian GLBT media makers about\npublic attitudes can be summarised in one word: silence. Let's see two examples of\nexperiencing this silence:\nWe wanted to put Oznanila into all of the high school libraries and again we came\nupon the most terrible opponent of sexual minorities: silence. We sent out applications,\nwe sent a free sample and a memo asking if we could keep sending it for free if they\nwould just offer it somehow in the library. We got twenty answers. (out of 120) Ten\nwere pro, ten were contra. The problem here is that this falls under the jurisdiction of\nthe librarian of the school. And we were surprised that more than two or three of the\npositive answers came from places in the country, not from the big cities. The majority\nof the negative ones came from the big cities. Everyone else just kept quiet, because\nnobody wanted to be bothered. That paints a very realistic picture of the attitude of the\ngeneral public. As soon as it becomes formal, as soon as their children are somehow\ninfluenced then things become very defensive and silence here is the most important\ndefence. (TR, SI)\nIt is not proper ... it is taboo. ... Once I took the gay magazine to my workplace to show\nthem how it was. ... they seemed to have an aversion from it, they just put it aside. They\nhad to face something that was not talked about for decades. (ML, HU)\nAmong the three countries Dutch answers reflected the least problematic situation:\nThere is little resistance against the Gay Krant in the Netherlands. Our paper is\nrespected and well known. (AE, NL)\nNo, there is no action against the media. They are too much group-bound for that.\nExtreme Christians don't see it as they are not looking for it. The rest, the general\npublic, is reasonably acceptant. (RD)\n• sexual minority media as \"powerful operators\"\nIn Hungary and in Slovenia partly because of their limited scope, partly because of the\nrelatively low level of social tolerance of same-sex relationships, GLBT media could\nhardly be seen as \"powerful operators\" in influencing their public in certain social or\npolitical issues or in their consumer behaviour. However, the fact that in Hungary there\nis a free advertisement leaflet, existing for one and half years suggests that at least\ncertain business men aim to reach their gay market via a gay publication. In Slovenia –\ncontrary to its limited availability – Lesbo seems to have some potential for intellectual\n– rather than marketing – influence.\nThey can if they are like Gay Times, this kind of magazine. It depends on how big the\ntarget group is, how the pink economy is working, because if you compare Great\nBritain and Slovenia, then it is completely different in a sense of influence. Of course, I\nthink our media are influential. Actually in the last few years they are becoming\ninfluential, a lot of academics are reading Lesbo and taking it abroad when they go to\nconferences and they are realising the importance of these media and the role that they\nhave. (TG, SI)\nAs far as possible political influence is concerned, one Hungarian respondent pointed\nout the following:\nIn more complex questions of identity formation, or in ideological questions that are\nnot about fashion, there is no homogeneity. In this group there are right wing\nsupporters as well as left wing supporters and everything else. So there is no way to\nmobilise these in political matters. This \"let's be liberal, let's be left-wingers\" attitude\nis a characteristic feature only in the organisations ... but what is going on in the bar\nscene, I don't know. ... sometimes I think that we would be surprised if we knew. (SB,\nHU)\nFrom the Dutch answers we can assume that there are at least two fields where GLBT\nmedia had the \"powerful operator\" role: marketing and GLBT emancipation.\n... the cultural aspect must not be overlooked: the minor media can be effective avant\ngarde trend setters who remain invisible to the wider public until someone from\nmainstream media notices and does something similar. Thus the message 'it's uncool to\nbe a bigot' was interwoven in a lot of products I was involved with. I think this cultural\npressure is at least as important in the struggle against discrimination as legislation.\n(CS, NL)\nFor opinion forming you have to go to the big daily papers, radio and television. Yes,\nas far as consumer information on sexual enjoyment, clothing and going out. (RD, NL)\nGay media are not powerful actors except the Gay Krant, which has been active in\nsuggesting and promoting the homohuwelijk (same-sex marriage). I doubt that gay\nmen consume the products advertised in the gay media because they advertise there. I\ndon't remember a gay boycott in the NL. If they (gay people) want to be influential,\nthey write for the general media (where they can publish in many cases). (GH, NL)\nThe Gay Krant played a major part in GLBT activism during its 23 year existence and\nmuch has been achieved. ... Partly because of the Gay Krant a broad basis of support\nhas been created, both politically as well as socially towards, among others, the Law\nfor Equal Treatment (anti-discrimination legislation) and the availability of civil\nmarriage for same-sex couples. (AE, NL)\n• financial background and resource management of sexual minority media\nproduction\nEarlier we could see that in two countries there were GLBT publications which made –\nat least part of – their living from advertising. It counted as a relatively new\nphenomenon in Hungary, but not in the Netherlands. Acknowledging GLBT people as\nworthwhile target audiences for advertisements can be interpreted as an indicator of\nsocial acceptance. Companies will advertise products for GLBT people only if their\nsocial visibility is relatively high. (The next step is to target GLBT consumers via\nmainstream media which is not an unknown case in the Netherlands and in other\nwestern countries.)\nIn general there are two main ways to finance GLBT media: to get some funds (from\nthe state or civil organisations) or to make money by advertising, by selling the product\nan/or using the income of another auxiliary business venture of the owner.\nThe first case (getting funds) applies to present day Slovenian sexual minority media\nproducts. Lesbo has been financed by several foundations (including the Dutch HIVOS\nand Mama Cash, the American ASTRAEA) and the Slovenian Ministry of Culture.\nLegebitrina Oznanila is supported by a student organisation, and Lesbomania by Radio\nStudent. In the past Revolver had a lot of problems with finding financial resources:\nfor a short while it was supported by the city council of Ljubljana but they stopped this\nbecause they said it was a pornographic magazine. Roza Val used to be financed as\nany other regular program on the national radio.\nIn the Netherlands the general pattern is self-maintenance, though some products can\ncount on other resources:\nIn principle these media should be able to support themselves, through subscriptions\nand advertising. In case of difficulties an appeal can be made to the Press Trade Fund,\nwhich supports a pluriform press in the Netherlands. Some gay media in the\nNetherlands are connected with organisations or firms. XL and Expreszo (youth\npaper) are [/were] (financially) connected to COC. Gay & Night is financed by the\nlargest male prostitution firm in Amsterdam. The Gay Krant is independent and\nmanages on subscriptions, sales and advertising. (AE, NL)\nThe only paper to get any subsidy was XL. That was the COC's own paper. The Pink\nRealm (Roze Rijk) radio programme is paid for by NPS, which is an official media\nbody. The remainder is private and is sponsored through the scene ([pink economy]\nbars, saunas, pornoproducers). I don't know about circulation figures. Radio\npenetration and viewer numbers do count, but are not watched too much by NPS. A\n[TV] comedy like Will & Grace is of course contingent on good viewer figures. (RD)\nIn Hungary we can find a mixed pattern of financing sexual minority media products.\nThe Mások gay magazine has been struggling for self-maintenance from the very\nbeginning: they have advertisements, they sell copies and very rarely get some\nfinancial support from NGOs or state institutions (mainly for promoting AIDS\nprevention). They obtain a certain amount of money from the \"one percents\", too. (In\nHungary taxpayers can decide which NGO they want to support with 1% of their\nannual personal income tax). A special type of support for Mások is that certain gay\nbusinessmen advertise in the magazine more as a token of their appreciation and\nphilanthropy than as a rational business decision. Na végre! is financed mainly by\nadvertisements (and by other business activities of its owner). The costs of the two\nnewsletters of the gay and lesbian organisations are covered by their organisations. The\nLabrisz book series is financed mainly by an American foundation (ASTRAEA). The\ncosts of the local community radio programs are covered by their host stations that are\nnon-profit radios, usually run by NGOs with the help of foundations and some state\nsupport. Önazonos is financed as any other public radio programme.\nIn Slovenia and in Hungary sexual minority media creators are typically volunteers\nwho do not get paid – or compensated in any way – for their work. In some cases they\nhave to cover the direct costs of their media production from their own pocket. So\nsometimes instead of getting paid they have to pay. Therefore enthusiasm, creativity –\nand dedicated involvement in GLBT activism – seem to be important characteristics of\nthese people. With the words of a Slovenian respondent: we are obviously maniacs –\nenthusiasts. It is really nice when we have made an issue, so the creativity is very\nimportant for the people here. (NS, SI). Volunteer work is also part of Dutch sexual\nminority media production, though probably not such an essential part as in Slovenia\nand in Hungary:\nI always feel that there should be a certain passion in it. Money should not be the\ndriving force. ... I do believe, that for most people motivation is the driving force, it's\nnot money. (DV, NL)\n• the \"pornography\" issue\nI asked the question \"should/can images of naked bodies, seen by some as\n'pornographic', and sexual minority media content be mixed?\" for two reasons. First,\nimages of naked bodies can – allegedly – sell certain GLBT publications, therefore this\naspect can become relevant when thinking about finding financial resources for a\nmedia product. Second, images of naked bodies seem to be normal parts of gay\npublications but are not really preferred by lesbian audiences, which can reflect a basic\ndivision between gay and lesbian media consumption  and perhaps a division between\ngay and lesbian cultural politics.\nBy comparing the three countries we can say that this \"issue\" was not really perceived\nas an issue in the Netherlands, or at least not by my gay respondents. According to\nthem naked images do deserve a place in sexual minority media, specifically if the\nmedia product in question is specialised.\nOf course it has a place. It is something that binds us, that love for the beautiful man\n(woman) and sex. I hope that it often appears in the paper, because it keeps the paper\nreadable: nice men and beautiful women in their natural state. Pornography is legal\nexcepting pedophile pornography. I do not consider it to be a problem, better still, I\nfind it an enjoyment. The only problem is there in the mixed media. Lesbians don't like\ndicks and gays don't like pussies. (RD, NL)\nHowever, quality content papers seem to be careful with naked pictures also in the\nNetherlands:\nIt is legally allowed and yes, it does sell. However, the Gay Krant decided to have as\nlittle naked material as possible, because we want to be evaluated on the basis of our\nnews and lifestyle reporting. Readers who do want to see naked images can opt for the\ncombi-subscription: the Gay Krant plus Freshmen (bimonthly). Freshmen is our Dutch\nedition of the equally named American naked mag. (AE, NL)\nThe Hungarian and the Slovenian answers reflected several interesting and important\nissues connected to my question. For example, some (gay) respondents emphasised the\n\"it sells\" aspect:\nThat sells the magazine. ... You are limited by the law as well. ... If it is pornography\nyou have to pay extra tax as well. ... First we send the magazine to the ministry of\nculture, I think, and then they decide the level of tax. (MS, SI)\nPreviously it was absolutely something to raise the number of sold copies. At that time,\nwhen it wasn't so easy yet to sit down at your computer, go on the net and download\nseveral thousands naked pictures (TL, HU)\nOn the other hand, the necessity to publish naked images can be challenged on the\nbasis of relatively easy access to the internet:\nIf I was an editor, I would not put them in. These kind of images can be accessed very\neasily through the internet. I see no reason for providing this through a magazine. I\nthink – speaking for the Slovenian context – that we have more important issues to deal\nwith at the moment. (RK, SI)\nOther respondents emphasised the \"lesbians don't really like this\" aspect:\nUnfortunately Mások is mainly for men. Most lesbians are shocked because of these\npictures. We have to admit that Mások is very GAPFILLING but we do not want to see\ndicks. That is a very different type of culture. (RJ, HU)\n... there are sharp oppositions here. Publications made by men focus more on the body\nthan those made by women. Lesbian media are maybe more intellectually oriented and\nthose who make it are usually aware of the fact that it is very difficult to reflect on\nissues whether porn is good or bad ... the problem is that women's bodies are used this\nway. Cover pages of magazines are full of naked women, and the papers are full of\nsexist attitudes which can determine women's place, so we won't publish naked women\nin a reified way – even if a lot of people like to look at naked women (SB, HU)\nIt is obviously not a coincidence in the world that magazines made by men and  women\nare separated, and very different in style. If the magazine is mixed, it has some\nrestrictive consequences. It seems that lesbians consciously ... and always want to\nemphasise that fat people, ugly people, old people are of the same value as the others.\nAnd in theory they are completely right, and I agree with them that we should not show\nbeauties all the time because this way we develop inhibitions in people, because it is a\nkind of exclusion, too. Still, people have this desire for this. I, as a gay man, have the\ndesire for it ... (LL, HU)\nThe Slovenian GLBT youth magazine applies a very sensitive approach to \"body use\":\nWe don't publish naked male or female bodies because that would promote a more\nsexual image of the youth group than we want to promote. ... the student organisation\nwouldn't protest, because they funded much more controversial projects, but I think\nour target group would be in danger. The people who really need our help might feel\nintimidated by graphic images of perfect bodies. ... They might feel that they don't\nmeasure up to it. There would be this barrier that would suggest that we are selecting\nonly the good ones ... When I was young, I always looked at the coverpages of\nRevolver in the shop windows. I never dared to buy one. I always saw pictures of\nnaked men and this gave me the impression that this was a porn magazine for gay\nporn, so I had this added fear of actually going into the store and buying it. It felt just\ntoo wrong. I didn't need that sexuality in a magazine, I really needed insightful\nthoughts, interviews, which of course were in there, but I never got to see them. (TR,\nSI)\nAccording to one respondent showing naked bodies has the danger of oversexualising\ngay culture:\nWe don't like to strengthen this sex centred image. Sex-centredness is a problem\nbecause for many homosexuality equals sex, penetration. While it is a way of thinking,\na lifestyle, culture. (PB, HU)\nSeveral respondents emphasised that it is hard to define what counts as \"pornographic\"\n– as everything depends on the context:\nI have nothing against images of naked bodies in any magazine, not even in those that\nare highly pornographic. I don't have anything against it. I don't think pornography is\nsomething bad at all. It depends on what you understand as pornography. If\npornography is only the pictures of naked people then it's O.K., but if we are talking\nabout exploitation of the people who are involved, then of course I am against it. ... if it\ndoes not give the message of exploitation and misuse of power, then it is O.K. for me,\nbut if there are pedophiliac messages or exploitation of women, included in the picture\nas a context, then of course I would be very much against it or if their is violence\ninvolved. (TG, SI)\nIt is hard to say where the border is. In Lesbo we have very liberal concepts. We are\nagainst hard definitions about what pornography is. ... What I can say is that we have\nvery open concepts. You will see what I mean. We published many photographs of\nnaked bodies, but in an artistic context. So it's not pornography, it's art dealing with\nnaked bodies. (NS, SI)\nIt all depends on the justification. The justification must be implicit enough, implicit in\nthe sense that the reader can see it and does not need to be told about it. For me\npersonally it had too much resemblance to the heterosexual journals that usually had\nfemale images and double pages ... There was a journal called Start in Croatia\ndecades ago, just like a regular culture magazine, a good one actually textwise, but it\nhad these women centrefold and stuff, I never thought much of it, I never thought it\nwas necessary. It is something that basically appeals to the same kind of mentality as\nheterosexual journals of the same kind, that had the centrefolds with women in. (Ble,\nSI)\nIt causes aversion, distancing. It makes the magazine repulsive. But bodies are not\ndisgusting by themselves. If these pictures come out in straight products – no problem.\nIn this context it is a cause for aversion. (ML, HU)\nAt the beginning in Revolver there were some photos of naked man, of course they\nwanted to have more of them, especially the readership. I was not very keen on it but\nthen I thought that's part of it, let them have it because I don't know, images of naked\nwomen were not so interesting for us as lesbians, it is not what we wanted, what you\nhave in every magazine ... when the city council said that it was a pornographic\nmagazine, then I was really angry, because they have this pornography in every\nstraight magazine, there are so many women's bodies, and nobody sees a problem with\nthis, and I think it is just hypocritical, because they are afraid of male bodies, to see\nthem – and then I said, yes, you should mix pornography and politics, it's possible (ST,\nSI)\nImages of naked bodies – or, as we will see in this case, a certain body part – can\nconstitute a part of a political message, too. At least this was the case with the first\nissue of Mások:\nIn our first printed issue on the inside cover page there was this picture of a huge erect\npenis. Awful, if I think about it now, it was truly awful. But at that time we thought\nabout it as the expression of our ars poetica: that this is exactly one of the main\nfunctions of this magazine that we don't have to hide and pretend any longer, that we\ndon't have to pretend to be different from what we really are. Sexuality is important,\nand we like good looking guys, let's speak openly at long last ... (LL, HU)\nConclusion\nExamining minority media in general can become important once we realise that \"[w]e\nare all colonized to some degree by the majority culture. Those of us who belong to\none minority group or another will inevitably have absorbed many mainstream values,\neven when they serve only to demean us. [...] Recognizing these patterns is a first step\ntoward demanding more even-handed media representation of all cultural groups. Yet\nthis does not, in itself, guarantee a solution.\" (Gross 2001:17). Concerning media\nvisibility in comparison with \"traditional\" ethnic or religious minorities, sexual\nminority groups are in a special position. For example, \"[m]uch has been written about\nTV's portrayal of ethnic and cultural minorities, and its historically negative impact on\nthe self-esteem of young people in those groups. Distorted images of gay lives have a\nsimilar effect on lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth. But unlike children in most\nminorities, whose family and friends can serve as role models, gay youth historically\nhad only stereotypes to tell them who they were.\" Therefore \"visibility, role models,\nand fair broadcast depictions were [are] too important to dismiss as just a luxury.\"\n(Capsuto, 2000:xiv).\nThe main goal of writing this study was to tell a story – in fact, several stories – about\nhow certain social minority groups can create and use their media means to represent\ntheir interests. By examining several aspects of sexual minority media production in\nHungary, in the Netherlands and in Slovenia we could see how the state of\ndevelopment of these media reflected different social situations and \"difference-\ntolerating\" levels of the examined societies.\nAccording to my findings minority can be seen as a useful – political – concept in a\nsociety or in a phase of socio-cultural, historical development when/where non-\nconventional sexual interests have discriminative consequences. In places where\nnormative heterosexuality is losing its social organising power  sexual habits, interests,\norientation based identities are not forced to develop, or at least not likely to develop\ninto threatened identities.\nIn comparison with the Netherlands, Slovenia and Hungary can be characterised by\nmore threats to cope with when realising one's non-conventional sexuality. Therefore\nin these places the political concept of minority can be applied when trying to create a\nmore tolerant, identity threat free social environment for people with same-sex or non-\nconventional sexual desires and experiences, developing – sometimes changing or\nfluid – identities based on these desires and experiences.\nThough my Slovenian and Hungarian respondents realised that the term minorities\nusually referred to ethnic or national minorities in their countries, they also recognised\nthe equal rights opportunities and anti-discriminative guarantees that can be gained by\napplying the minority concept to gays, lesbians, and other non-heterosexuals.\nHowever, the usage of the minority concept has several disadvantages, too. It does not\nonly imply the acknowledgement of the relative powerlessness of the social group in\nquestion but it also has to operate with fixed – identity – categories.\nThis term reflects a practical political strategy to gain equal rights and – at least\ntemporary – shelter from discrimination, and naturally it makes more sense in a social\ncontext where there are still a lot of things to fight for. Probably for Dutch people the\nterm sexual minority sounds quite strange – and perhaps a bit empty – because it is\nlacking the political connotations that Hungarians and Slovenians are still quite\nfamiliar with.\nSexual minority media was seen to be made for and by members of sexual minorities\nbut it did not have to be exclusively so. The peripheral of the target audience\nnecessarily interfaces with mainstream society – through, for example, parents, friends\nand collegues – and some sexual minority media producers take this into account. As\nsexual minority media productivity matures there appears to be a trend towards\nspecialisation: mixed media – i.e. media produced by gays and lesbians working\ntogether, for an aggregate gay and lesbian public – tend to become more homogenous:\neither lesbian or gay only. Specialisation is an indicator of development as it turned out\nfrom the review of the various sexual minority media products in the three countries.\nMedia product specialisation does not imply that cooperative networks stop\nfunctioning: joint events, like pride and film festivals, will continue to be organised by\na broad spectrum of GLBT activists working together.\nProbably the most \"stable\" function of sexual minority media is the information\nfunction. It is stable in the sense that the importance of this function seems to be\nindependent from changing socio-cultural contexts. While the importance of other\nfunctions – such as community building, helping people in their coming out process or\nentertaining them – can change according to the changing social environments. In\nHungary and Slovenia identity building\nseemed to be a primary media function, and there was a strong connection between\nGLBT activism and sexual minority media production. In places where mainstream\nmedia are unable to mediate the special needs and claims of sexual minorities, special\nmedia segments must be created by the concerned groups in order to provide their\nconstituencies with positive reference points for identity formation. In the Netherlands\nmedia producers with a GLBT outlook were able to use mass media to project GLBT\ncultural elements into the mainstream. This was possible because the level of social\ndiscrimination in the Netherlands twenty years ago was rather less than in present day\nHungary or Slovenia. This explains the emphasis on lifestyle over identity building as\npresent day Dutch GLBT emancipation concerns are rather lifestyle issues.\nHungarian and Slovenian activists seem to be eager to complete the identity building\nand follow the Dutch model. Their ideal would be that sexual minority media would no\nlonger be necessary as an autonomous entity, the mainstream media would encompass\nthe various sexual minority media products, thus nullifying the distinction between\nsexual minorities and the majority in this respect. At present we can still witness the\nfunctioning of identity politics in both societies. The \"natural\" context of identity\npolitics is civil society, the field of social self-organisation, being the framework as\nwell as the guarantee of modern identity formations (cf. Er s 1994). The two countries\ncan be characterised by different levels of civil society development which can also\nexplain the advantage Slovenia seems to have over Hungary in respect of sexual\nidentity politics. In Slovenia civil society initiatives appeared already in the 1980s,\nwhile in Hungary involvement in civil activities still counts as a relatively new – and\nnot at all wide-spread – experience.\nAs regards perception of official media policy, the Slovenian case showed that altough\nthere is a good official policy in place there is still substantial stereotyping in practice.\nAgain, social discrimination is a harder nut to crack than judicial discrimination.\nHowever, social discrimination does not translate to a negative attitude of the general\npublic towards sexual minority media, largely through ignorance. While in Slovenia\nand in Hungary the lack of reaction can be often interpreted as \"hate silence\", in the\nNetherlands the quietness is more a sign of peaceful acceptance. Consequently, GLBT\nmedia can be seen as powerful operators in the Netherlands in influencing certain\nimportant societal issues such as same-sex marriage, in Slovenia sexual minority\nmedia can be influential only within a restricted elite. Because of the well-developed\nDutch \"pink economy\", GLBT media can also be powerful in the commercial sense. In\nHungary, having a significantly larger market than Slovenia, sexual minority media\nhave started to exert influence on a commercial basis. This also explains why the\nsexual minority media products had to be financed by NGOs and foundations, and\ncould not operate on a commercial footing. Once sexual minority media production\noutgrows the no-budget, self-financing, small scale stage, further expansion is only\npossible either through commercial financing or through grants. This usually implies\nthat a choice has to be made: commercial financing can lead to compromises in\npolitics, while grant option faces the problem that grants are hard to find. Activists\ndream of large grants with no strings attached, but market rules can force their hand\ntoo. So, whereas in some cases only the philantropic finance option is possible\n(Slovenia), in other cases a commercial approach may be the only option for survival\n(Hungary).\nConcerning the printed press, a final look at some naked material is appropriate. There\nwere cultural indicators for including erotic material, particularly in gay specialised\nmagazines. Additionally there were commercial reasons for doing so. On the other\nhand, there were cultural indicators against the inclusion of naked images:20 some\ntried to struggle against (over)sexualisation, some wanted to avoid intimidating their\npublic with picture-perfect bodies, some protested against the exploitation of women.\nFinally, it was noted that the distinction between pornography and cultural eroticism is\na hard one to make objectively.\nOn the basis of my findings no \"one size fits all\" recommendations can be given, as all\nexamined factors interconnect. The diversity of sexual minority media development in\n                                               \n20 See, for example, Richard Dyer’s thought provoking article about the cultural aspects of gay\npornography  (Dyer 2002)\nthe three countries is both a symptom and a cause of the fact that GLBT media\nfunction in a very social-context-specific way. In all three countries sexual minority\nmedia provided a cultural contra-weight against societal oppression, albeit in different\nmanifestations. Ultimatelly these type of media must be of a transient nature as they\nare in a way working towards making themselves irrelevant politically, but on the\nother hand, they advance themselves culturally doing so. Given the great strides taken\nin the Netherlands, our \"model\" country, and the very concrete results achieved since\ntransition in Hungary, and from even before that in the case of Slovenia a clear\nrecommendation is that this development must be continued.\nI applaud the makers of sexual minority media products, because they put into practice\nthe theory that \"the most effective form of resistance to the hegemony of the\nmainstream is to speak for oneself, to create narratives and images that counter the\naccepted, oppressive, or inaccurate ones\" (Gross 2001:19).\nPolicy recommendations\nGLBT people can/should use the political concept of minority (usually applied to\nethnic minorities) in places where they still have to fight against legal and social\ndiscrimination.\nIn places where mainstream media are unable to mediate the special needs and claims\nof sexual minorities, special media segments must be created by the concerned groups\nin order to provide their constituencies with positive reference points for identity\nformation. Example of missing practices: lack of regular lesbian magazine in Hungary,\nlack of regular gay magazine in Slovenia.\nOwn media have a cultural impact. Minority media content does tend to filter into the\nmainstream media, hence to society at large. In the long run culture is at least as an\neffective emancipatory agent as legislation. This is a reason to support such cultural\nactivity financially. Example of good practice: the Slovenian LESBO.\nCross-fertilisation between groups of activists and minority media organisations can\nlead to good results. Example of good practice from Slovenia: film festival \u0001 Magnus\n\u0001 Revolver.\nAdvances in computer and communication technology in the past twenty years have\nmade it much easier to establish low-budget media (print, radio, internet). Initiatives\nlike courses and workshops designed to allow activists to make optimum use of the\nnew technologies are likely to yield a good return on their investment. Examples of\ngood practice: the Slovenian Queer Resources Directory and the pride.hu portal.\nReferences\nBech, Henning (1993) The Disappearance of the Modern Homosexual.

The history,\nthe resource-management, and the main issues of these media products show us how\ncertain stigmatised social groups create and use their media means to represent their\ninterests. Several aspects of sexual minority media production in the three countries are\nexamined to show a relation between the \"difference-tolerating\" levels of the examined\nsocieties and  the state of development of these media.\nIn all three countries sexual minority media provided a cultural contra-weight against\nsocietal oppression, albeit in different manifestations. Ultimately these type of media\nmust be of a transient nature as they are in a way working towards making themselves\nirrelevant politically, but on the other hand, they advance themselves and their\nconstituencies culturally doing so.\n",
