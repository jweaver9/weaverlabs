The faculty reviewers have expertise in disciplines closely \nrelated to those represented by this work. If possible, the work was also reviewed by undergraduates in \ncollaboration with the faculty reviewers. \nAbstract \nAward for Best Conference Paper \n2018 Northwest Undergraduate Conference in the Humanities \nThis paper provides brief summation of the methods transphobia are embodied through language and \nwhat the logical, moral, and business implications would be for a Christian University. In this paper, Adi \nMcNally (who uses they/them pronouns) explores whether there is both scientific and theological weight \nbehind transphobic and gendered language choices. They connect the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of \nlinguistic relativity to discussions around epicene pronouns and English grammatical development. Their \nargument explores writings from Doctors Lawrence Mayer and Paul McHugh, and its impact on \ntraditionally conservative Christian thought. Further, they discuss alternative Christian viewpoints and how \nthe core tenets of the Christian argue the necessity of gender-neutral and gender-conscious language. \nKeywords \nLGBTQIA+, transgender, Christian universities, Sapir Whorf Hypothesis, linguistic relativity, non-binary \nThis research article is available in International Journal of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities: \nhttps://commons.pacificu.edu/ijurca/vol10/iss2/1 \nIn Gender Revolution, a film on the \nstreaming service Netflix, Brian Douglas \ntells his story. From a casual observer’s \npoint of view, he is a normal male; however, \nBrian was not born male, nor female. He \nwas born an intersex person. His doctors had \ndecided, in infancy, that he did not fit the \ngenital requirements to be considered a \nmale, thus he was assigned the female \ngender and lived as a woman for fifty years. \nAfter undergoing a difficult transition, he is \nhappy and comfortable as a male, but the \nresults of his forced gender façade have left \na permanent impact on his life. According to \na recent study, eighty-four percent of \ntransgender women have been verbally \nharassed and sixty-three percent have been \nphysically assaulted (Klemmer et al 12). If \nthe lives and stories of Brian and many other \nqueer persons are no irregularity, it is a \nsurety that to live as an exception to gender \nnormality is to live as a walking target for \ndiscrimination, violence and hardship. \nAccording to a probability study on \nhousehold populations, transgender \nindividuals are more likely to be below the \npoverty line and not graduate college due to \ndiscrimination and bullying (Crissman et al \n215). The conclusion of their research was \nthat socioeconomic disadvantage is the \nculprit of transgender mental health \nproblems. In a study by The Williams \nInstitute, suicide rates among the \ntransgender and gender non-conforming \npopulation are found to be most highly \ncorrelated with “rejection, discrimination, \nvictimization, and violence related to [being] \nanti-transgender” (Haas et al 16). Another \nstudy shows a statistically significant \ncorrelation between mental health of \ntransgender and gender non-conforming \nyouth (ages sixteen to twenty-four) and \nfamilial support. Transgender and gender \nnon-conforming youth who have little to no \nsupport show suicide rates fifty-three \npercent higher than supported transgender \nyouth (Travers et al 2). The common \ncorrelation between suicide and simply \nbeing transgender or gender non-conforming \nis a fallacy that fails to consider all the \nvariables involved in minority stress. Rather, \nthis research demonstrates how large of an \nimpact social influences have on the well-\nbeing of transgender individuals. \nWhen on Christian campuses, \ntransgender persons are not always facing \noutright discrimination, but they certainly \nlack support and affirmation. This can be \nattributed less to hatred and far more to a \nlack of education. In the Christian faiths, \nmany firmly believe in the equality of all \npeople under God; because they believe that \nhumans were made after God’s own image, \nwhich creates a disparity between these \nideals and the implementation of gender \nequality in Christian communities. Queer \nChristians and cis-gender Christians have \nmore in common than is widely assumed \nand it is through these similarities progress \ncan be made. All participants in a \nuniversity’s community are affected by \nlanguage, ranging from genderqueer \nstudents and feminist faculty to cis-gender \nyouth and conservative staff. Because these \ngroups share both the ideals of respect and \nlove, and value for academic thought it is \nboth plausible and profitable to find a place \nof mutual respect and understanding through \nlanguage. \nSexist and androcentric language is \nfar more complex than speaking about non-\nmasculine people negatively. It is the \nstereotypes, microaggressions, and minute \ndetails of language that create a negative \nstigma around people of all genders. Take, \nfor example, the sentence, “The President \nholds the highest office in the US; he has a \nlarge amount of power.” This sentence \nimplies that the President of the United \nStates has and always will be male. Simply \nreplacing the “he” pronoun with “he or she” \n1\nMcNally: Gender-Neutral Language in Christian Universities\nDOI: 10.7710/2168-0620.1124\nwould drastically change any negative \nimplications. \n“He or she” would be an appropriate \nuse of pronouns from a binary standpoint. \nThe gender binary is the concept that only \ntwo genders exist, male and female. Any \ndeviations therefore must be deformities or a \nresult of mental illness in the case of \ntransgender and genderqueer persons. The \ngender binary is often focused on physical \nsex and tends to stereotype each gender so \nthat men and women can properly perform \ntheir assigned cultural roles. Ideas such as \nseeing all men as strong, emotionless \nprotectors and women as emotional, \ncompassionate, and domestic creatures \npsychologically reinforces the gender \nbinary. \nAn opposing view to the gender \nbinary model is a model of gender fluidity. \nSam Killermann, an activist, educator, and \nartist portrays this fluid model of gender \nidentity/expression, sexuality, and sex with \nhis illustration “The Genderbread Person.” \nOnes gender identity, expression, and sex all \nexist on a spectrum. The existence of \nintersex persons provides proof that physical \nsex is not limited to two strict types of \ngenitalia. To be genderqueer then is to be “a \nperson who does not subscribe to \nconventional gender distinctions but \nidentifies with neither, both, or a \ncombination of male and female genders” \n(OED). \nBeing genderqueer is not a new \nconcept nor found only in Western culture. \nWithin many different cultures and societies, \na neuter, third, or other gender is recognized \nthrough the usage of epicene pronouns. In \nhis article “Gender, pronouns, and thought,” \nCaleb Everett, doctor of anthropological \nlinguistics, gives this definition: “Epicene \npronouns denote particular referents without \nindexing the gender of those referents” \n(134). English is a language that lacks a \nspecific and widely accepted epicene \npronoun. \nOne major reason why gendered \nlanguage is so impactful on a society is \nbecause of an idea proposed in the Sapir-\nWhorf hypothesis of Linguistic Relativity. A \ncore idea in Linguistic Relativity is how the \nlanguage one speaks effects the way one \nthinks. For example, in French there is no \nword for “pet.” There are words for dogs \n(les chiens) and cats (les chats) but there is \nno specific word that describes domestic \nanimal companions. When a concept lacks a \ndescriptive word, it is hard or even \nimpossible for a language speaker to \nconceive of it. Therefore language-speakers \nwithout epicene pronouns are more likely to \nhave a more gendered view of the world. \nSince English does not use an \nepicene pronoun, one cannot study how \nepicene pronouns affect English speakers. \nThus, Everett related the epicene pronoun \ndiscussion to androcentric language and the \nSapir-Whorf Hypothesis of Linguistic \nRelativity and implemented a study in which \ngender-ambiguous figures are shown to \nEnglish speakers and Karitiâna speakers. \nKaritiâna is a language spoken in northern \nBrazil that uses epicene pronouns. In \nEverett’s study, a male bias appeared in the \nnaming of all the gender-ambiguous figures \nno matter the language spoken; however, the \nEnglish speakers used male names far more \noften, indicating a stronger androcentric \nbias. Despite the Karitiâna speakers’ lack of \nan egalitarian society, they have a more \ngender-neutral perception of intentionally \nambiguous figures simply because they have \nan epicene pronoun. Everett concludes that, \nwere English to systematically accept an \nepicene pronoun, “it will actually result in a \nmore gender-neutral perception of certain \nstimuli by English speakers” (149). This \npractical application of the Sapir-Whorf \ntheory of linguistic relativity establishes \nhow deeply gender roles are ingrained in \n2\nInternational Journal of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities, Vol. 10 [2018], Art. 1\nDOI: 10.7710/2168-0620.1124\nsociety, and not biology. One must then \nconsider whether a shift in the English \nlanguage is necessary and whether it will be \neffective. \nThe perception of gender roles, in \nline with Sapir-Whorf logic, is both \ninfluenced by and influences language \nchoice. The consequences of this \nlinguistically-enforced stigma is often \nostracization, something a university that \nclaims to be inclusive and open-minded \nshould be concerned with. Jane G. Stout and \nNilanjana Dasgupta overview the effects of \nsexist language in their 2011 article, “When \nHe Doesn’t Mean You,” in the context of \ncollege students seeking employment. In \ntheir research, they found that not only does \nsexist language result in a sense of \nostracism, but it also results in action on the \npart of the ostracized. The women who read \njob descriptions that were male biased were \nfar less likely to apply to the position, \nespecially if the position was a \nstereotypically male position. Thus, one can \ninfer even the smallest linguistic factors \ncould affect application rates, something that \ncould potentially harm universities. \nA notable conflict that many \nconservative persons have about using \ngender-neutral language is whether it is, in \npractice, good for the people who are asking \nfor it. Lawrence Mayer and Paul McHugh \nwould say “no.” Their essay, “Sexuality and \nGender: Findings from the Biological, \nPsychological, and Social Sciences,” argues \nstudies of gender identity are so variant and \ninconclusive that there is no way to argue \nfor the fluid model of gender or for the \neffectiveness of gender confirming \ntreatment. They correlate the high suicide \nrates post-transition with simply being \ntransgender or gender non-conforming. \nThus, Mayer and McHugh claim that \nexperiencing gender dysphoria is a mental \nillness (like body dysmorphia for a person \nwith an eating disorder) and should be \ntreated as such. \nAn interesting aspect of Mayer and \nMcHugh’s report is that it was not peer \nreviewed and it was denounced by the very \nuniversity it was born from: Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. The group of faculties who \ndenounced the “Sexuality and Gender” \narticle point out many flaws in Mayer and \nMcHugh’s methodology, including but not \nlimited to ignoring studies on the \npsychological effects of stigma and \ndiscrimination. Representative faculty stated \nin a The Baltimore Sun op-ed: \nAs faculty at Johns Hopkins, we are \ncommitted to serving the health \nneeds of the LGBTQ community in a \nmanner that is informed by the best \navailable science…The report…was \nnot published in the scientific \nliterature, where it would have been \nsubject to rigorous peer review prior \nto publication. (Beyrer et al) \nConsidering the controversy over the \nvalidity of this article, it is a bit concerning \nthat many conservative and Christian groups \nwould be so quick to cite Mayer and \nMcHugh. While some conservative groups \nhave small amounts of influence on the \nmatter, Premier Christianity with their \ntwelve thousand subscribers on YouTube, \nmore than twenty thousand followers on \nTwitter, and nearly thirty-five thousand likes \non Facebook certainly have a decent amount \nof influence on Christian thinking. \nIn Peter Saunders magazine op-ed \nfor Premier Christianity, “Refusing to \nidentify your baby as a boy or a girl is a new \nlow in the upside-down world of gender \nideology,” he offers the following \ntheological points. First, the original model \nof creation should be a framework for \nviewing gender ideology. If the first people \nwere created male and female, that is what \nGod’s plan was and it should not be deviated \nfrom. Secondly, one must view gender \n3\nMcNally: Gender-Neutral Language in Christian Universities\nDOI: 10.7710/2168-0620.1124\nissues knowing that the world has “fallen.” \nBeing intersex or transgender, fitting outside \nthe gender binary: these are mental and \nphysical conditions and distortions of what \nGod intended humanity to be. Citing Mayer \nand McHugh, they claim that science \nsupports this idea. Then, they argue how \nnecessary it is to not “capitulate to \ntransgender ideology (“Refusing to \nidentify…”). Calling a person by their chosen \nname and pronouns and allowing them \ngender-neutral bathrooms is not loving, it is \nabusive. They then underline how “the \ntransgender condition” is an opportunity to \nspread the gospel as Jesus does not call \npeople to come as they are but rather, to \ncome, repent, and live according to God’s \nwill. \nThe line of thinking Premier \nChristianity proposes is contradictory in a \nfew ways; however, the overall desire to \nlove and support the LGBTQIA+ \ncommunity that Premier Christianity \nproposes is valid. Karin Heller, Professor of \nTheology and research coordinator of \nWhitworth University’s Women’s and \nGender Studies Program, provides many \ninsights on how transgender people should \nbe integrated into a faith culture. She notes \nthat transgender individuals experiencing \nhardship is not an indication they are \ninferior, in fact there is some biblical \nevidence otherwise. To this point, Heller \nquotes the Bible: “For there are eunuchs \nwho were born that way, and there are \neunuchs who have been made eunuchs by \nothers--and there are those who choose to \nlive like eunuchs for the sake of the \nkingdom of heaven” (Matt. 19:12). The \ndefinition of the ancient word for “eunuch” \nis highly debated, but Heller defines it to be \neither an intersex person or a person who \nhas been genitally mutilated for liturgical \nreasons. In Acts 8:26–40, Phillip meets and \nbaptizes a eunuch. If being a eunuch was \nwrong or some disability, God would have \nmost likely healed him. The eunuch was not \nhealed, however, because he did not need to \nbe. He was not deformed or depraved. He \nwas good enough simply as he was created. \nIf God loves people as they are, why would \nthey ask them to abandon their unique \ndiversity simply to conform to the wishes of \nthe majority. Asking a transgender person to \nbe cis-gender is the moral equivalent to \nasking a person of color to bleach their skin. \nThat, in no way, is love. \nTo make an educated decision about \nwhether gender-neutral pronouns should be \nused, one must examine both theology and \nthe sciences. There is no refuting Mayer and \nMcHugh’s arguments that there is not \nenough research about the biological effects \nof and on gender identity. Considering the \nstatus of transgender people as a great \nminority, it is logical that the funding and \nresources for large-scale studies on \ntransgender people are simply not available. \nThe most problematic way to view the few \nstudies there are on transgender individuals \nis to assume the status of being transgender \nis directly caused by mental health \nconditions. \nIf a Christian university’s goal is to \nimplement Christ’s love in the sphere of \nhigher education, to be inclusive and \nfactually correct, and to increase their \nstudent body, evidence suggests that using \ngender-neutral language systematically \ncould be extremely beneficial. The core \nideals that Christians hold about treating \npeople who are different is uniform overall, \nhowever the application of such ideals needs \nto be considered and discussed. \nChanging the entire English \nlanguage to include some new epicene \npronoun (i.e., “ze” and “zem”) would be \nextremely difficult, however English has \nalready had a form of epicene pronoun that \nhas only over the past hundred years been \ncontroversial in the eyes of some. In Pride \nand Prejudice, one can see Jane Austen’s \n4\nInternational Journal of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities, Vol. 10 [2018], Art. 1\nDOI: 10.7710/2168-0620.1124\nuse of a singular they: “everybody began to \nfind out that they had always distrusted his \nappearance of goodness [emphasis added]” \n(Austen 280). Additionally, in William \nShakespeare’s poem “The Rape of \nLucrece”: “And every one to rest themselves \nbetake [emphasis added]” (Kamm 83). The \nMerriam-Webster dictionary in their own \npublic communications have stood by using \n“they” as a singular pronoun as a completely \ngrammatically correct option (“They”). \nIn addition to implementing gender-\nneutral language as a normal form of speech \nit is important that more research is done \nabout transgender, genderqueer, and \nLGBTQIA+ experiences in universities and \nsociety at large. The greatest issue here is \nignorance, not hatred. All people can learn \nfrom each other and continue to change the \nworld in positive ways. \nWhether one agrees with the validity \nof transgender and non-binary people or not, \nit is necessary for an academic organization \nthat claims to be Christian to fully consider \nall the facets of LGBTQIA+ issues. Not \nonly is there significant scientific debate \nover the topic, but it is a topic that causes \ncontroversy on moral grounds. Political and \nreligious leanings should, however, not \ninterfere with how one treats others. \nDifferences in belief and opinion in a \nreligious community are impossible to \nignore or even to completely overcome, \nhowever since being rational, respectful and \nloving is what matters, we can use these \ndifferences to become stronger. \n \nWORKS CITED \nAusten, Jane.
