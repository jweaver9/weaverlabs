StavertI. INTRODUCTIONIn 1965, when Jewell Akens debuted the hit song, The Birds and the Bees,the American pop culture gave no second thought to the lyric \"a girl and aguy.\" ' Differentiating between a man and a woman, and the natural attractionto the opposite sex, seemed simple enough. In 1969, however, Johns HopkinsUniversity opened the nation's first clinic to perform so-called sex reassignmentsurgery (hereinafter \"SRS\") on males wanting to be females and femaleswanting to be males.2 When a follow-up study of transsexuals treated by theclinic severally criticized the legitimacy of SRS,3 the program was immediatelyshut down, and other university-sponsored clinics followed suit like dominos.4Now, due to the emergence of private clinics performing SRS, a debate hasemerged over whether the law should classify postoperative transsexuals astheir desired sex or their birth sex for purposes of marriage.5t Mathew D.

The words \"sex\" and \"gender\" will be used interchangeably to mean the same thing.Some transsexual advocates have attempted to differentiate between the two, arguing that \"sex\"refers more to biology and physiology and \"gender\" refers to the expression of maleness orfemaleness. See e.g., Julie A. Greenberg, Deconstructing Binary Race and Sex Categories: AComparison of the Multiracial and Transgendered Experience, 39 SAN DEEGo L. REv. 917(2002); Julie A.

Rev. 459 2007-2008LIBERTY UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWThe legal status of postoperative transsexuals for purposes of marriage is animportant issue for both marriage and sex-based classifications. If sex can bechanged like clothes, then law defining marriage or granting protected status onaccount of sex will become meaningless. In addressing the legal status ofpostoperative transsexuals, Section I of this article will begin by recognizing thelongstanding marriage laws in the United States that sanction marriage onlybetween one man and one woman. Section II will then discuss in some detailthe medical issues involving sex and sexual disorders, and will also discusswhether sex should be defined biologically or psychologically for purposes ofmarriage.II. THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES REGARDING SAME-SEX MARRIAGEThe Supreme Court of the United States has recognized traditional male-female marriage as \"the foundation of the family and society, without whichthere would be neither civilization nor progress.\"6 Justice Holmes observed\"some form of permanent association between the sexes\" is one of therudimentary characteristics of civilization.7 The \"structure of society itselflargely depends upon the institution of marriage [which is founded upon the]joining of the man and woman .... ,,8 In \"every enlightened government,\"marriage \"is pre-eminently the basis of civil institutions, and thus an object ofthe deepest public concem.\" 9L.

Hawaiifollowed its 1994 statutory definition of marriage with a constitutionalamendment in 1998 to ensure that the definition of marriage remained the soleprovince of the legislative branch. 2  Since the passage of constitutionalamendments by Alaska and Hawaii in 1998, other states including Nebraska(2000), Nevada (2002), Missouri (2004), Louisiana (2004), Oregon (2004),Kentucky (2004), Michigan (2004), Mississippi (2004), Georgia (2004), NorthDakota (2004), Ohio (2004), Oklahoma (2004), Arkansas (2004), Montana(2004), Utah (2004), Kansas (2005), Texas (2005), Alabama (2006), Colorado(2006), Idaho (2006), South Carolina (2006), South Dakota (2006), Tennessee(2006), Virginia (2006), and Wisconsin (2006) have also used the amendmentprocess to ban same-sex marriage.' 3 Although Vermont passed the nation's firstsame-sex civil union law in 2000, its statutory scheme limits marriage to oneman and one woman. 14 Several statutes which address incestuous marriages12. See HAw. CONST. art. 1, § 23. The referendum was in response to the Hawaii SupremeCourt's decision which stated that a ban on same-sex marriage must survive strict scrutiny underthe Hawaii constitution. See Baehr v. Miike, 994 P.2d 566 (Haw. 1999); see also Baehr v.Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, reconsideration granted in part, 875 P.2d 225 (Haw. 1993). Prior to thereferendum, in 1994, the legislature had declared that marriage is limited to one man and onewoman. See HAw. REV. STAT. § 572-1 (marriage is \"only between a man and a woman\").13.

Alaska), which held that a restriction on marriage must survivestrict scrutiny under the Alaska constitution. The constitutional amendment overruled theBrause decision. In six states, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, Arizona, and Colorado,courts have held that proposed constitutional amendments defining marriage as \"one man andone woman\" do not violate the single-subject rule. Although not ruling on the single-subjectrule, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that the state may proceed with aconstitutional amendment defining marriage as \"one man and one woman,\" even if it requiresoverruling a decision by the state's highest court. See Schulman v. Attorney General, 447 Mass.189 (2006).14. Vermont statutes provide for \"civil marriage\" for opposite-sex partners and \"civilunions\" for same-sex partners. The statutes expressly state that a \"civil union\" is not a \"civilmarriage.\" See VT. STAT. tit. 15 § 8; VT.

This is true even thoughmarried couples are not required to become parents and even thoughsome couples are incapable of becoming parents and even thoughnot all couples who produce children are married. These, however,are exceptional situations. The fact remains that marriage exists as aprotected legal institution primarily because of societal valuesassociated with the propagation of the human race.33Therefore, defining \"marriage to exclude homosexual or any other same-sexrelationships is not to create an inherently suspect legislative classification..Although some may contend that \"other cultures may have fostereddiffering definitions of marriage, marriage in this state, as elsewhere in thenation, has been deemed a private relationship of a man and a woman (husbandand wife) which involves 'interests of basic importance to our society.\"'35\"[T]he state has exclusive dominion over the legal institution of marriage [andthe] societal values which are involved in this area must be left to theexamination of the legislature ....

The Federal Defense of Marriage Act Recognizes the States' Interest inTraditional Male-Female MarriageIn response to the failed attempt in Hawaii to judicially recognize same-sexmarriage, Congress passed what is known as the Federal Defense of MarriageAct (DOMA).3 7 Congress designed the Federal DOMA to permit each state toset its own marriage policy, giving each state the right to refuse full faith andcredit to any out-of-state same-sex union. Effective September 21, 1996, thelaw the Federal DOMA was amended to read as follows:No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indiantribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, orjudicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or triberespecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is33.

During the Constitutional Convention the \"effects clause\"became the subject of controversy. The issue was whether the Full Faith andCredit Clause would include the power to govern the effects not only of statecourt judgments, but also of the legislative acts of the states.4 ' Justice JosephStory noted in his commentary that the \"effects\" are \"expressly subjected to thelegislative power.'4 2The First Congress enacted the Full Faith and Credit Act to \"prescribe themode in which the public Acts, Records and judicial Proceedings in each State,shall be authenticated so as to take effect in every other state.' 43 Today the FullFaith and Credit Act remains essentially unchanged and states the following:\"Such acts, records and judicial proceedings or copies thereof, so authenticated,shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United Statesand its Territories and Possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts ofsuch State, Territory or Possession from which they are taken.'\"4Pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution to determine the \"effects\"of acts, records, or judicial proceedings in another state, Congress passed theFederal DOMA.Prima facie every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts itsown statutes, lawfully enacted.

The longstanding public policyfrom the founding of this country to the present has restricted marriage to onlyone man and one woman. The Federal DOMA protects state sovereignty withrespect to setting marriage policy by allowing states to refuse recognition to anyout-of-state same-sex union.

Until theFlorida legislature recognizes sex-reassignment procedures andamends the marriage statutes to clarify the marital rights of apostoperative transsexual person, we must adhere to the commonmeaning of the statutory terms and invalidate any marriage that isnot between persons of the opposite sex determined by theirbiological sex at birth.

The plain, ordinary meaning of\"persons of the opposite sex\" contemplates a biological man and abiological woman and not persons who are experiencing genderdysphoria. A female-to-male post-operative transsexual does not fitthe definition of a female. The male organs have been removed, butthe ability to \"produce ova and bear offspring\" does not and neverdid exist. There is no womb, cervix, or ovaries, nor is there anychange in his chromosomes. As the Littleton court noted, thetranssexual still \"inhabits... a male body in all aspects other thanwhat the physicians have supplied.\",8 1The court rejected the argument that the absence of the word \"transsexual\"from the same-sex marriage statute made the statute vague. \"We view thelegislative silence to indicate that transsexuals are not included.

If we learn anything at all from theinternational cases, we should only note with a nod that the country which mostparallels our common law system is Great Britain, and the historicalinterpretation by these courts have concluded that sex must be determinedbiologically and that a transsexual may not marry a person whose sex is thesame as the transsexual's sex at birth.The first reported transsexual case in the world is Corbett v. Corbett.43Corbett involved a person whose sex at birth was male, but who laterunderwent an operation to remove his testicles and most of the scrotum, alongwith an incision to create an artificial \"vagina.\" Arthur Corbett met thistranssexual who presented himself as a woman and the two married. After themarriage, Mr. Corbett learned that his \"wife\" was actually a man. He filed fordivorce, asking the court to declare the \"marriage\" null and void. Afterlistening to medical testimony, the court noted that there were several possiblefactors in determining a person's sex, which included (1) chromosomes; (2)gonads (the presence or absence of testes or ovaries); (3) genitalia (includinginternal and external sex organs); (4) psychological; and (5) hormonal factors orsecondary sexual characteristics (such as the distribution of hair and physique).Discussing the inherent problems with hormonal and psychological factors, thecourt observed the following:Since marriage is essentially a relationship between man andwoman, the validity of the marriage in this case depends, in myjudgment, on whether the respondent is or is not a woman....Having regard to this essentially heterosexual character of therelationship which is called marriage, the criteria must, in myjudgment, be biological, for even the most extreme degree oftranssexualism in a male or the most severe hormonal imbalancewhich can exist in a person with male chromosomes, male gonadsand male genitalia cannot reproduce a person who is naturallycapable of performing the essential role of a woman in marriage. Inother words, the law should adopt, in the first place, the first three ofthe doctors' criteria, i.e., the chromosomal, gonadal and genitaltests, and if all three are congruent, determine the sex for thepurpose of marriage accordingly, and ignore any operativeintervention .... My conclusion, therefore, is that the respondent isnot a woman for the purposes of marriage but is a biological maleCoNsTrrUTON.

It follows that the so-called marriage of10th September 1963 is void. 44The court in Corbett recognized any other decision incorporating hormonal orbiological factors would be fraught with insurmountable difficulties. The courtpondered the following questions:If a law were to recognize the [sex surgery] \"assignment\" of therespondent to the female sex, the question which would have to beanswered is, what was the respondent's sex immediately before theoperation? If the answer is that it depends on 'assignment' then, ifthe decision at that time was female, the respondent would be afemale with male sex organs and no female ones. If the assignmentto the female sex is made after the operation, then the operation haschanged the sex. From this it would follow that if a 50-year-oldmale transsexual, married and the father of children, underwent theoperation, he would then have to be regarded in law as a female, andcapable of 'marrying' a man! The results would be nothing if notbizarre .... Marriage is a relationship which depends on sex andnot on gender. 145The holding in Corbett was reexamined and confirmed in England in thecase of Bellinger v. Bellinger. Until recently, the European Court of HumanRights had routinely upheld England's refusal to recognize the right oftranssexuals to marry.146In W. v. W., the court in South Africa followed the decision in Corbett. Thecourt found a transsexual marriage to be invalid and stated that the \"evidencedoes not show that the operation converted her into a female.

In the caseof In re C. & D. (1979) 28 A.L.R.524, an Australian court considered the case of ahermaphrodite who was born with one testicle, one ovary, a uterus, breasts and a penis. Thisperson also had a rudimentary vagina. In an attempt to \"correct\" his anatomical anomalies, thisperson underwent a series of surgical operations, in the course of which his female attributeswere removed. He then married a female for a period of some five years, but he was not able toconsummate the marriage. The wife sought a Decree of Nullity. The court found that inAustralia, marriage is \"the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others\" and wassatisfied that on the evidence, the \"husband was neither man nor woman but was a combinationof both, and a marriage in the true sense of the word as within the definition referred to abovecould not have taken place and did not exist.\" The marriage was therefore void.149.

In Ying v.Eric,158 the court considered a female who underwent sex-reassignment surgeryto become male, including a phalloplasty which involved the construction of anartificial \"penis.\" The court noted that \"since the respondent's penis wasartificial, erection for sexual intercourse was not possible.\" The court foundthat \"one's sex is fixed at the moment of conception\" and that chromosomesshould be the primary relevant factor in determining sex. The Singapore courtconsidered relevant law and concluded as follows:It is desirable in the interests of certainty and consistency for theword \"man\" under the Charter to be given the ordinary meaning thatis in contradistinction to woman. A person biologically a femalewith an artificial penis, after surgery and psychologically a male,must, for purposes of contracting a monogamous marriage of oneman and one woman, under the Charter be regarded as a \"woman.\"The court therefore declared the marriage to be a nullity and then concluded:\"A person who has undergone a sex-change operation cannot be regarded asbelonging to the sex for which reassignment surgery was undertaken forpurposes of a monogamous marriage under the Charter.\"2. Subjective Psychological Definition-The Minority ruleThe minority rule, especially in America, includes a subjective psychologicalcomponent to the definition of \"sex\" or \"gender.\" There is only one reportedcase in America that has followed this path, along with several internationaldecisions.15 9 There are no such rulings internationally among common-lawcountries.i.

Family Court at Otahuhu,17 1 a New Zealand courtfound that for purposes of the New Zealand Marriage Act of 1955, where aperson had undergone surgical and medical procedures, such a person couldmarry another, even though that other person was of the same birth sex as thetranssexual. The court noted that the Marriage Act of 1955 did not \"refer toman and woman or husband and wife\" as a specific union, but the courtnevertheless considered marriage to be the union of one man and one woman.In addressing where to draw the line, the court noted that in orderfor a transsexual to be eligible to marry in the sex of assignment, theend of the continuum must have been reached and reconstructivesurgery done.... [T]here must be as complete a transformation as ispossible before that person can qualify as a person of his or herchosen sex for the purpose of marriage.172The court noted that a \"preoperative transsexual\" who dresses and behaves inthe assigned sex may be accepted in that sex for employment and socialpurposes, such as a driver's license, but it would \"not be appropriate for such aperson whose genitals do not correspond with the sex of assignment to be ableto many in that sex.' 73 The court realized that its reasoning was on somewhatshaky ground when it artificially drew the line for marriage by requiring theperson to actually undergo sex surgery. Once a psychological component isconsidered, it is incongruent to force a person to undergo surgery, yet this courtdrew the line with a surgical scalpel.174169. Id. at 304.170.

If a psychological component is considered important in determining a person's sex,then one cannot easily argue that surgery is necessary to complete the so-called sextransformation.

Sex must be determined by objective ratherthan subjective standards.IV. SEX REASSIGNMENT SURGERY DOES NOT CHANGE A PERSON'S SEXHormone treatment and plastic surgery do not transform a male to femalenor a female to male. If that were the case, there will be many surprisedfemales who have undergone surgical mastectomies or hysterectomies. Toassume plastic surgery changes sex is an insult to these women. Since surgerycannot change sex, and \"thoughts\" are too amorphous to be objective, biologymust be the determinant.A. Chromosomes Determine SexThe X and Y chromosomes are the biological drivers that determine sex. Achromosome is one of the threadlike \"packages\" of genes and other DNA in thenucleus of a cell. Humans have twenty-three pairs of chromosomes for a totalof forty-six; forty-four autosomes and two sex chromosomes. Each parentcontributes one chromosome to each pair, so offspring get half of theirchromosomes from their mother and half from their father. 76 The egg carriesthe X chromosome while the sperm carries either an X or a y.177Unless the Y chromosome is present and properly transcribed, the child willdevelop into a female. In extremely rare cases, genetic mutations or defectsdesired sex, when another person who is more physically and financially capable can do so?Including a psychological component to determine sex is fraught with innumerable problems.175.

Genetic males (XY)do not show this Barr body since they only have one X chromosome, whichstays active. 8 8 One problem that the Olympics Committee had with the Buccalsmear was its inability to properly detect intersexuality.

As alreadynoted, transsexuals are not intersex and intersexuals are not transsexuals. Anintersex condition is an ambiguity between the chromosomes and the gonads orgenitalia. Transsexuals have harmony between the chromosomes, gonads andgenitalia, but claim a conflict between the mind and the body.98The transsexual movement is reminiscent of cultural trends in the 1960s to\"normalize\" schizophrenia by claiming schizophrenics were victims of\"psychiatric oppression.\" Because of these efforts, thousands of mentally illpeople were released from hospitals to the streets, often becoming homeless orincarcerated. 199 Anne Fausto-Sterling, the author of the study erroneouslyclaiming intersex conditions affect 1.7 percent of the population, argued that allpossible combinations of sexual anatomy should be considered normal, and thatclassifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are \"mere socialconventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightenedintelligentsia., 200  One advocate wrote that \"transsexualism [is] a sociallyconstructed problem created by the medical establishment .... ,,20 HarryBenjamin opined that \"[i]nstead of treating the patient, might it not be wiserand more sensible to treat society . . . ?,202 The currently fashionablemovement toward \"tolerance\" and freedom from \"oppressive\" social constraintsbecomes absurd when it ignores reality.

Female-to-male surgery includes a radical mastectomy, a totalhysterectomy (removal of the uterus and ovaries), testosterone injections, and inrare cases, an artificial construction of a penis (phalloplasty) or enlargement ofthe clitoris (metaidoioplasty). Phalloplasty merely creates an imitation penisthat lacks sensitivity and will not become erect without a stiffening device.2 °4Studies indicate that many who undergo a phalloplasty are unhappy with theirresulting imitation organ.2 °5 When a patient chooses not to undergo aphalloplasty, another surgical option is a metaidoioplasty. This techniqueallows the clitoris to extend further out, and it shapes the enlarged clitoris tolook more like a small penis.20 6 The length of the metaidoioplasty-enlargedclitoris would still be insufficient for intercourse.20 7Hormonal treatment of the female-to-male and male-to-female transsexualscan cause a number of dangerous side effects.2 \" Some research shows thatfemale-to-male transsexuals who have been treated with hormones for four tofive years, but have not had a hysterectomy, have developed \"intrauterinecomplications.\" 20 9 Hormone treatment, commonly used by transsexual patients,substantially increases risk of cardiovascular disease and liver complications.2'0Long-term, high-dose androgen therapy is associated with impaired vascularreactivity in genetic females, independent of the effects of androgens on204.

As a result, when Mickey was twenty-two, he applied for SRS.The doctors evaluated Mickey and approved his sex-reassignment surgery.222Mickey began to take hormones and dress and act as a woman, and lived as afemale for two and a half years. 23 Researchers report that, in fact, he was avery convincing female.224 However, a day before he was to enter the hospitalto have his genitals removed, the hospital changed its policy and refused toperform further sex-reassignment surgeries. 225 Disappointed, Mickey continuedto live as a female. Through a series of events and therapy, however, his desireto become a woman subsided until it finally disappeared.226 Mickey fell in lovewith a woman and repudiated his desire to have his genitals removed and to liveas the opposite sex. Researchers report that he now leads a happier and morestable life than he did when living as a woman. 227 Tragically, researchers alsotell stories of individuals who have the same recovery only after sex-reassignment surgery has taken place.228219.

If the law grants a new\"sex\" status for those who have been diagnosed with GID and who undergoSRS, the law undoubtedly will be required to grant a new sex status for allindividuals diagnosed with GID, even without SRS.236There are as many opinions concerning the treatment of GID as there arepsychiatrists and psychologists. 237 The lack of uniformity among the field maybe due to the rarity of the diagnosis.238 One study concluded that a variety ofinterventions involving the parent and the child lowered cross-genderidentification.239  There are three approaches concerning child/parentintervention: behavioral, eclectic, and analytic. 240 Literature concerning thetreatment of adolescents is rare, however, supportive therapy is the generalapproach.241 The political movement of the transsexual community has had aprofound effect on the field of counseling by causing some extreme counselorsto believe that this mental illness should be encouraged. 42Many psychiatrists oppose treating adolescence GID with irreversiblemeasures or even hormone administration too quickly because it may be amistake.243 Some psychiatrists speculate a \"rapid agreement for sexreassignment would signal that the therapist (who should maintain a neutralposition) supports the patient's desire for a sex change., 244 Expressing evenmore concern, Dr. Paul Mc Hugh, Chairman of the Psychiatry Department atJohn's Hopkins, criticized SRS as \"radical, irreversible surgeries. 245234.

Bradley and Zucker adhere tothe premise that the origin of GID is \"multifactorial. ' '248 Those who follow thelatter model generally determine that one must look beyond biology to observefactors such as \"the role of temperament, parental reinforcement of cross-gender behavior during the sensitive period of gender identity formation, familydynamics, parental psychopathology, peer relationships, and the multiplemeanings that might underlie the child's fantasy of becoming a member of theopposite sex.,,249 Although the exact source of GID is unknown, a prospectivestudy concluded that individuals with a non-homosexual preference, combinedwith psychopathology and dissatisfaction with secondary sex characteristics,were more likely to function poorer postoperatively and express morediscontentment about the outcome or result SRS had on their lives.250 This mayindicate that homosexuality is an indicator of a better postoperative outcome.Thus, there are many unanswered questions. The law should not make ananomaly the norm by giving legal marriage status to transsexuals.2.

In addition, there are significant social, personal, andoccupational issues that may result from surgical sex changes, and the patientmay require psychotherapy or counseling. 257 Major self-mutilation, includingeye enucleation and amputation of limbs or genitals, is also usually associated258with severe gender identity disturbances or with psychotic states.Patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder will typicallymanifest self-mutilation beginning in adolescence and may continue to manifestself-mutilation for decades.259 Self-mutilation and the act of \"letting of blood\"becomes a quick method of relieving anxiety or anger.2 60 The mere fact that abehavior will relieve anxiety or psychological distress, however, is insufficientto justify the behavior when it involves mutilation. Similarly, SRS is a type ofbodily mutilation that is not justified merely because some contend it willrelieve psychological distress. 261 Psychological distress is not unique to GID; itis a characteristic of a mental disorder, which is defined in the DSM-IV-TR as\"a clinically important collection of symptoms (these can be behavioral orpsychological) that causes an individual distress, disability, or the increased riskof suffering pain, disability, death, or the loss of freedom., 262 Dr. Tabin, of theNational Committee for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, noted thedanger of using the prevention of significant psychological distress as ajustification for stress-reducing behavior by pointing out that suicide attemptswould then have to be considered normal when desired by the participants.263253.

Rev. 502 2007-2008TRANSSEXUALISM AND THE BINARY DIVIDEThere are many types of disorders of self-mutilation in which a significantlevel of cognitive dissonance exists between bodily perception and reality.Theories regarding the appropriate therapy differ. Whether it is amputating alimb or burning oneself, the proposed manner of treatment for such disordersvaries widely depending on the etiology. GID is a mental disorder, and as such,GID is analogous to other self-mutilating disorders. Cognitive dissonancebetween mind and body is insufficient to find SRS as the only solution.Self-mutilation is defined as an \"act that often . . . alleviates pathologicalsymptoms [such as] a perplexing feeling of numbness, strangeness, andunreality in regard to one's body, thoughts, and emotions as well as to personsand objects in the environment.\" 264  Among the different types of self-mutilation is genital mutilation.265 SRS is analogous to genital mutilation.266Psychological pain is a common symptom of self-mutilation disorders, inwhich individuals report that their actions help relieve psychological pain.267Some claim that self-injury is a means of promoting a sense of well-being andcontrol.268 Self-mutilation disorders are often related to life factors and clinicalcorrelates such as childhood sexual abuse and subsequent Post Traumatic StressDisorder and life conditions such as the loss of a parent, childhood illness,depression, physical abuse, parental alcoholism, or parental marital violence.269Studies suggest that there is also a strong correlation between sexual abuse andGID.270Treatment for self-mutilating disorders includes learning to manage self-injurious impulses and psychoanalysis. 271 Specifically, self-destructive acts canbe understood as resulting from and symbolizing certain intrapsychic phantasiesinvolving wishes, fears, and compromises, in which psychoanalysis providesthe optimum vehicle for the modification of the \"internal self and objectNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH AND THERAPY FOR HOMOsExuALITY, available athttp://www.narth.com/docs/symposium.htm (last visited Sept. 6,2008) [hereinafter NARTH].264.

Psychotherapy is often effective inaddressing cognitive dissonance between mind and body.273Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia are characterized bythe co-occurrence of pathological thoughts and emotions concerningappearance, eating, and food, leading to alterations in body composition andfunctioning that are the direct result of these symptoms. 274  Similar todisturbances in body image, GID is a disturbance in gender image that oftenleads to alterations in body composition and appearance. 275  Proposedtreatments for anorexia include acute weight restoration and re-feeding as wellas individual, family, and group therapy.276 Treatments for bulimia consistmainly of cognitive-behavioral approaches, as such treatments have been foundeffective.277 While both GID and eating disorders are mental disorders inwhich there is a discrepancy between one's perceived and actual physical body,acceptable treatments for eating disorders consist of changing mental constructsthrough cognitive therapy, or changing behavior through therapy.2 78 Treatmentdoes not consist of validating the skewed body image, no matter how much thepatient may truly perceive that mental image to be reality.279 In the same way,proper treatment for GID should focus on treating the patient's mind in order todevelop a healthy self-concept of body through cognitive therapy, rather thanthrough radical surgical mutilation.Paraphilias are a type of sexual disorder characterized by recurrent, intensesexual urges or behaviors that are considered unusual or deviant by society.2 80Such urges or behaviors also cause clinically significant distress or impairmentin social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.28' Likewise,GID is also a type of sexual disorder that can be described as a recurring sexualbehavior, or a mindset, that causes clinically significant distress or272.

Therefore, doctors should treat GID as any other paraphilia bycognitive therapy and not mutilation.Another type of sexual disorder is sadomasochism, which is characterized bya relation of dominance and submission, infliction of pain that is experienced aspleasurable by both partners, deliberate humiliation of the other party,fetishistic elements, and one or more ritualistic activities.283 In some instances,sadomasochism is paraphiliac when it is the only way for an individual to getsexually aroused and satisfied.284 Treatment for sadomasochism includestraditional psychoanalysis and behavior therapy techniques.285 Sadomasochismis treated as a \"mental disorder,\" characterized by distress, harm, or functionalimpairment.286 Even though in some instances sadomasochism maybe the onlymeans of sexual arousal in an individual, thereby apt to cause a significantamount of psychological distress if the behavior is not permitted, treatmententails modifying the mind and behavior instead of condoning such activity forthe sake of easing the mind and decreasing psychological distress.Pedophilia is a sexual disorder in which adults justify having sex withchildren by displacing blame onto the infants.287 Treatment for pedophiliaincludes negative conditioning, cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication, andhormones to decrease the sex drive.288 In short, treatment focuses on changingthe sexual urges. Pedophilia, in its description as a \"perversion,\" implies thatthere is a \"moral normative standard\" from which the perversion deviates. Thequestion therefore remains how one defmes the normative conception ofperversion. Deeply rooted in American culture and public policy is the norm ofmale and female, man and woman.As a matter of public policy, in order to maintain a consistent jurisprudence,the determination of sex must be independent from the psychological musings.An individual's sex preference can manifest itself at different times in life:282.

The diagnosis of GID is itself a changing diagnosis sincesome children diagnosed with GID may later in life display few, if any,symptoms. 290 In fact, only a very small number of children with GID continueto have symptoms that meet the criteria for GID in later adolescence oradulthood.291 Most children with GID display less overt cross-gender behaviorsas time passes, as parental intervention increases, or as peer responseincreases.292Treatment for children diagnosed with GID focuses on secondary problemssuch as depression, anxiety, and self-esteem.293 Therapeutic modalities forchildren with GID are for the most part diametrically different from some formsof treatment for adults, since children typically undergo psychosocial therapysessions only, and the focus of treatment is designed to instill positiveidentification of the child with the child's biological sex.294 Adult males whoseovert signs of GID appear later and more gradually in adulthood tend to bemore ambivalent about SRS and are also \"less likely to be satisfied aftersurgery.,295 There are reported cases of spontaneous remission of GID in adultswho develop symptoms later in life.296 The inconsistency of the diagnosis ofGID with the passage of time and other variables, the mistaken confusion ofsexual preference with gender confusion, and the possibility of remission ofGID underscore the dangerous use of a psychological definition of sex as thebasis for a legal definition of sex.For transsexuals, SRS cannot serve as a bright line to determine sex.

SRS isnot always the proposed treatment for GID.29 7 The Harry BenjaminInternational Association Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disordersnoted that some individuals diagnosed with GID neither desired nor werecandidates for SRS.298 A person claiming the same cognitive dissonancebetween perceived and actual sex could argue that sex should be determinedsolely by subjective mental thoughts. Such a person may contend that SRS isnot desired, is too expensive, or is contraindicated due to some secondarymedical condition.299 Thus, SRS cannot be deemed the threshold over whichone must cross to legally change sex. Subjective mental thoughts about sex aretoo amorphous to use as a baseline to establish sex. The only line to draw mustbe with the biological and not the psychological pen.The modem approach to treatment of GID highlights the importance ofcognitive styles and nonsurgical psychological treatments, despite the earlieremphasis on SRS, as propagated in 1966 by Harry Benjamin.300 The use ofcognitive-behavioral therapy in treating GID is important due to thepsychological etiology of GID. A 1976 study found that gender dysphoria wascaused by an excessive identification of patients with their mothers, and theinability of these mothers to permit their sons to separate from their mother'sbodies-resulting in an etiology of mother-infant symbiosis and absentfathers.301 In the same vein, a study in 1992 proposed that persons with GIDseemed to have similar mental dimensions to those who suffered from chronicdepressive disorders. 30 2 Despite thirty years of research on gender dysphoria,there is a marked lack of research on the \"broader issues of cognitive style and296.

Part of the ethical code of the helping professions is that treatment musthave beneficence and the patient has the right to treatment with the least drasticalternative. 3°4 Beneficence or responsible care means that psychologists engagein actions that are \"likely to benefit others, or at least do no harm. 305 A study in1978 showed that those who regretted having SRS shared the followingcharacteristics in common: inadequate family support, inadequate self-support,inappropriate physical build, and heterosexual experience following SRS.3°6 Astudy of transsexual satisfaction in 1965 showed that more than thirty-threepercent attempted suicide post-surgery, and more than twenty-five percentappeared to have a schizoid or personality disorder.30 7 A study of male-to-female transsexuals in 1981 showed that twenty-four percentofSRS outcomeswere unsatisfactory.308Psychiatric diagnoses change over time, as evidenced by the ever-changingDiagnostic and Statistical Manual (\"DSM\").3°9 For example, multiplepersonality disorder was recognized in the DSM HI-R under its traditionalname, but in the manual, DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR, it appears as disassociativeidentity disorder.31 ° Since psychiatric diagnoses are subject to change, andsince the disorder is subject to change during a person's life, it is precarious torest a legal definition of sex on a constantly moving premise.Some contend that gender identity is defined by how a person feels at anygiven moment. 311 The fallacy in relying on the subjective is that sex becomesmerely afeeling. Human feeling, by definition capricious, cannot be a standardupon which our judicial system relies-sex cannot be determined by a303. Id. at611.304.

Rather, sex must be determinedby objective and immutable standards.The problem of defining sex psychologically is best illustrated byconsidering another mental disorder, known as Apotemnophilia or BodyIntegrity Identity Disorder (\"BlID\").312 Apotemnophiles feel that they are adisabled person trapped in a nondisabled body (not unlike believing one is aman trapped in a woman's body).313 Clinicians generally recognize thisdisorder as a paraphilia, or a displaced sexual desire such as transvestism,voyeurism, pedophilia, and bestiality.314Apotemnophilia is a condition where one has an overwhelming desire toamputate his or her own body parts for sexual purposes or be with an amputeesexually.315 Dr. Greg Furth \"is a longtime crusader for increased BIID research.He has also been trying for many years to persuade doctors to cut off his right312.

All one must dois perform a simple internet search with 'the term \"wannabe\" (or \"amputeewannabe\") for those who wish to have an amputation and \"devotee\" (or\"amputee devotee\") for those who wish to have sexual relations with anamputee.317 Apotemnophiliais a psychological condition in which the individual requests anelective amputation. Individuals with this condition experience thepersistent desire to have their body physically match the idealizedimage they have of themselves. This desire forces individuals todeal with the paradox of losing one or more major limbs (i.e. arm[s]or leg[s]) to become whole. In their minds, \"Less is more\".31 8According to researchers at Columbia University,There are several conditions that may cause patients to seekamputation. These include:1. Transsexuals who usually mutilate only the genitals in orderto assume the physical appearance of the opposite sex.2. Schizophrenics who may self-mutilate in response to voicesordering them to do so or in response to a delusional belief that thebody part is defective or bad.3. Patients with a personality disorder, who appear to mutilate torelieve tension or gain secondary advancement.4. Confused patients who may injure themselves due todisinhibition, poor judgment or perceptual difficulties.5. Depressed patients who may mutilate themselves in a failedsuicide attempt, or as atonement for perceived sins.6. Patients with Body Dysmorphic Disorder who seek bodymodification in response to some perceived physical imperfection.7. Patients with Factitious Disorder are so eager to enter the sickperson's role that they will intentionally produce psychological orphysical symptoms.8. BIID patients appear to seek amputation in order to achieve theirperceived body image.319316. Id.317. Some have classified \"wannabes\" as apotemnophilia, and \"devotees\" asacrotomophilia.

One website boasts over 3,600 members.320The search retums several hundred results, and not surprisingly, most of thesepeople are affiliated with the transsexual movement. Some even call theirdesire to remove a perfectly healthy limb transsexual in nature. For example,proponents of amputation as a \"cure\" insist, much like transsexuals, that theonly way to help these mentally ill people is to mutilate their bodies to fit theirminds. To date, most of the American medical community still recognizes theamputation of a perfectly healthy limb as unethical and surgeons in the UnitedStates will not amputate the limbs of apotemnophiliacs. 321 If the state validatesthe actions of the mentally ill by legally recognizing their \"new\" sex, theoutcome of such actions has the potential to lead to even more extrememutilations, such as the amputation of healthy limbs. A psychiatrist thatspecializes in apotemnophilia cannot guarantee that after surgery to remove ahealthy limb the urge will not come back to remove more healthy limbs.3122Medical ethicist Arthur Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania says, \"It'sabsolute utter lunacy to go along with a request to maim somebody\" eithersexually or physically. 323 He states that when a person is running aroundconvinced they want their leg (or anything else) chopped off, they are hardlycompetent to make life-altering decisions.324The emergence of apotemnophilia creates one of the strongest argumentsagainst allowing SRS. Indeed, the fact that most practitioners and wannabesargue apotemnophilia is no different than GID and amputation is like SRS 325\"undermines the uniqueness of sex-change surgery and challenges the social320.

He later questioned why hehad wanted to do this to himself in the first place.32 9 He became even moredepressed after the amputation than he was to begin with and cried when hespoke of what he had done.330The man who severed his penis was lucky compared to the man who madethe only reported case to date in this country dealing with apotemnophilia.331The latter did not live to shed tears about his decision. Gregg Furth and PhilipBondy, sufferers of apotemnophilia, each made an appointment to have a legamputated with an underground surgeon in San Diego known unaffectionatelyamong the transsexual crowd as \"Butcher Brown.\" Dr. John Ronald Brownagreed to the operations as long as they were performed in Mexico. AlthoughMr. Furth eventually backed out of the operation after seeing an assistant with alarge knife, Philip Bondy, a seventy-nine-year-old man, decided to go throughwith the leg amputation.

With respect to transsexualismand apotemnophilia, history is repeating the blunder culturally motivatedpsychiatric fads had on schizophrenics. 336  When the \"anti-psychiatrists\"convinced the government and society that the schizophrenics were simplymisunderstood beings living an alternative lifestyle that needed to escape theoppressive bounds of mental hospitals, they did so under a guise of freedom.They had to convince others it was the social custom that was oppressive. Inother words, the schizophrenics were fine. The culture merely needed to accepttheir alternate lifestyles. Some argued that schizophrenics were created byoutdated and nonprogressive cultural norms.337 Contrary to what thoseadvocating \"freedom\" predicted, the mentally ill did not function in society;they suffered greatly as a result of this innovative idea.338 It became evidentthat schizophrenics really were sick and incapable of functioning in societyafter most of them ended up homeless. Similarly, there are contemporaryefforts to declassify transsexualism as a mental disorder and to transformsociety into acceptance rather than treating the disorder.339According to one medical ethicist, if the apotemnophiliac movement were tobecome accepted, as its sister disorder transsexualism is becoming, the lawwould in fact view voluntary amputation the same as some advocates want the334.

CONCLUSIONFrom founding of the country to the present, the public policy, as reflectedin the common and statutory law, recognizes marriage exclusively between oneman and one woman. For purposes of marriage, sex has always been assumedto be binary-male and female. Sex, like race, is an immutable characteristic.However, some transsexual advocates argue that sex should not be consideredstatic. They argue that sex should not be determined by objective factors suchas biology or physiology but by subjective mental desires. This line ofreasoning is fraught with problems.If sex is primarily a state of mind which is subject to change over time, thenequal protection for sex-based classifications becomes meaningless. To haveany meaning at all, sex must continue to be immutable under the law. Sex mustbe determined by objective factors based on biology and physiology. Whileplastic surgery may alter a person's physical appearance, it does not change aperson's birth sex. SRS is controversial and cannot be the bright linedeterminate of a person's sex. If sex were determined primarily by subjectivemental musings, then an argument could be made that SRS is not necessary.What should the law do with a transsexual who, after undergoing SRS, decidesto revert back to the original birth sex? Moreover, what should the law do witha person suffering from GID when the desire to be the opposite sex remits ordisappears? If the law recognized that sex is subjective, a person could be bornone sex, later acknowledged by the law to become another, and then again laterdetermined by law to revert to the original sex. Such a result is absolutelyabsurd. Sex can, and must, be determined by objective biological andphysiological factors.340. See Seenan, supra note 322.341. Id.[Vol. 2:459HeinOnline -- 2 Liberty U. L.
