MEYERS* I. INTRODUCTION “Despite all the achievements of civilization, the human being is still one of the most vulnerable creatures on earth.” - Vladimir Putin1 “You are alone, you are not normal”; that is how Aleksander Berezkin learned he was intersex.2 Born in 1984 in Novokuznetsk—a steel-producing town in southwestern Siberia, not unlike Pittsburgh in terms of climate and local economy3—Aleksander lived the life of an ordinary boy until his adolescence, when puberty failed to arrive. “When I was at school, my body looked visibly different from other teenagers,” Aleksander recalled.4 “I had no muscles . . . [n]o hair on the face. I was skinny and tall. With narrow shoulders and wide hips. Breast glands were enlarged. Sometimes people took me for a girl. I have been bullied and humiliated.”5 Desperate for answers and relief from the merciless taunting and social ostracism, at the age of seventeen Aleksander submitted to a genetic test that revealed the truth. While typical males have the chromosomes XY, Aleksander’s were XXY; he was diagnosed with a variation of Klinefelter syndrome, in which an extra X chromosome inhibits the body’s production of testosterone and leads to the development of stereotypically feminine traits in males.6 But Aleksander received little comfort from his intersex diagnosis, nor   Copyright © 2019 by Maggie J.

Intersex people are born with sex characteristics, including genitals, gonads or chromosome patterns, which do not fit binary notions of male or female bodies.7 There is no norm for what being intersex looks like. Someone who is otherwise ostensibly female may have male XY chromosomes, an individual who appears externally male may have internal female anatomy including ovaries and a uterus, or a child may be born with perfectly ambiguous genitalia, equally comprised of male and female components. The innumerable variations range from very minor deviations (indeed, some people may live their entire lives without ever learning they are intersex) to the unmistakable and profound.8 Being intersex has no bearing upon one’s gender identity—an intersex person may identify as male, female, both, or neither—nor upon their sexual orientation. The United Nations estimates that up to 1.7% of the worldwide population is intersex.9 That works out to approximately 130 million intersex people, roughly equal to the total population of Mexico or Japan.10 Yet the frequency of people born outside the male-female binary has not necessarily translated into widespread visibility, consideration, or legal protections. The state of intersex rights globally is in transition. Intersex infants and children are still frequently subjected to surgeries to “normalize” their anatomy: mismatched gonads are removed, too-large clitorises are cut down or extracted entirely, and wholesale sex-change operations are performed before the patient can even speak, much less give informed consent.11 While parents and legal guardians are generally granted great deference in making medical decisions for their children, parental decision-making is limited by nations’ interests in protecting the health and privacy of minors.12 Two factors have made surgeries on   7.

One featured intersex advocate, Pidgeon Pagonis, explained the surgery they underwent to reduce the size of their clitoris when they were three: “[the doctors] claimed that they were going to preserve the function and the feeling, but in reality it was all about appearance, and they kind of just hacked away at it until it was out of sight and out of mind.” Id.

They continue to face daunting barriers to changing their sex designation on identification documents, accessing adequate healthcare, and fighting discrimination in employment, education, housing, and athletics.18 Promisingly, the ethicality of “normalizing” surgeries on intersex children is increasingly contested in many developed nations, including the United States.19 While some surgeons in the world’s leading hospitals continue to perform these procedures,20 they have declined in frequency, with many medical practitioners (including three former U.S. Surgeons-General) condemning such surgeries as  fundamental right and sterilization procedures have the potential for extreme abuse.” Id.

Furthermore, these cosmetic alterations are frequently rooted in outdated and heteronormative philosophy, for example prioritizing an individual’s ability to have penetrative sex over sensation or their gender identity.

Determined to change repressive Russian attitudes toward intersexuality, he became a fierce advocate of intersex and LGBT rights as a college student in Vladivostok, until harassment from both community members and local law enforcement compelled him to flee the country for political asylum in New York.30 From his adopted home in the United States, Aleksander continues his mission to better the lives of intersex people in Russia;31 yet the task is a daunting one. The injurious state of intersex rights in Russia is not the result of simple ignorance or prejudice alone, but a calculated departure from prior policy to advance social conformity under Joseph Stalin and the rise of the Communist Party.32 While the nations that have already enacted protections for intersex people have been motivated by genuine human rights concerns,33 inspiring Russia to abandon its persecution of intersexuality will necessitate arguments incorporating longstanding Russian values and pride in East Slavic heritage.34 Reform, at least ostensibly, must come from within. This Note will explore how current laws and policies affecting intersex Russians are the creation of Western ideologies, and how the values and traditions that are synonymous with Russian identity actually support intersex rights. Part II will trace the legal and social status of intersex people through Russian history beginning in the 1800s, from relative protection under the tsarist aristocracy; to ubiquitous, yet fleeting, sexual liberation during the Bolshevik Revolution; to the rigid familial roles and social conformity of Stalinism, which still persists today under President Vladimir Putin. Part III will explore the current legal status of intersex people in Russia and the devastating effects that discriminatory laws and a vacuum of legal protections have on human rights in the region. Finally, Part IV will illustrate how Russian law, history, and values support the advancement of intersex rights, in order to provide potential avenues to lifesaving social and legal reform.   30.

Numerous historians and legal scholars have noted the insular and nationalistic nature of Russian society as a barrier to social progress: advances in human rights are often perceived as Western imperialism and as incongruous with East Slavic values, and thus have difficulty gaining political or social traction.

POL. 326, 326 (2015) (“In their rhetoric around the need to reject ‘western values’ and protect ‘traditional Russian culture,’ the state appears to have discovered a legitimate justificatory rhetoric that enables the restriction and curtailment of human rights, particularly those of opposition activists.”); Theodore P. Gerber, Public Opinion on Human Rights in Putin-era Russia: Continuities, Changes, and Sources of Variation, 16 J. HUM. RTS. 314, 320 (2017) (“However, most studies of Russians’ views of democracy and civil society institutions call for skepticism that support for civil liberties would increase, given their association with liberal ideology explicitly condemned as ‘Western’ in the government’s resurgent nationalist rhetoric. While not definitive, robust support for Putin during his crackdown on human rights is suggestive that human rights—and specifically civil liberties—are low priorities for most Russians.”). Rooting arguments for modern human rights in Russian history and tradition is a solution to this problem.

INTERSEXUALITY IN RUSSIA THROUGH THE AGES “The path towards a free society has not been simple.  There are tragic and glorious pages in our history.” - Vladimir Putin35 In 882 CE—over six centuries before the Americas were penciled into maps of the known world—the first East Slavic state, known by today’s historians as Kievan Rus’, was established in the vast, forested plain between the Ural Mountains and modern-day Poland.36 By the year 1200, the capital city of Kiev hosted up to 50,000 residents, a population exceeding that of contemporary London, Prague, Naples, Ghent, Rouen, or Rome.37 Kievan Rus’ was also home to cultural and technological advances—including high literacy rates, sewage systems, wooden pavement, property and inheritance rights for women, and the general disuse of capital or corporal punishment in favor of fines—which were rarities in Western Europe.38 Kievan Rus’, as a formidable ancestor of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, the Russian Empire, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and finally the Russian Federation, was a resounding beacon of what East Slavic civilization could achieve. Doubtlessly, intersex Slavs have been living on the land we now call Russia for over a millennium. Intersexuality, previously called hermaphroditism,39 is a biological phenomenon that has been acknowledged by innumerable cultures since antiquity. The worship of intersex deities,40 legal classifications of sex as male, female, or “hermaphrodite,”41 and records of intersex births and individuals42 demonstrate that intersexuality is not an invention or exaggeration of postmodern gender theory but a constant across centuries and continents.   35.

Acknowledgement and Ambiguity in the Russian Empire  Historical and legal documents dating from as early as the eighteenth century depict how Russian doctors, political leaders, and religious institutions have wrestled with how to handle intersex citizens.48 Russian law made no mention of intersexuality from its inception in the tenth century through the Revolution, so the legal system provided no answers to the “problem” of sexual ambiguity.49 Indeed, despite the protestations of at least one physician—who in 1865 called intersexuality “a public and judicial question which in our opinion is of no small importance”—the Russian government consistently declined to codify the treatment or status of intersex people.50          Officials of the Russian Orthodox Church51 would occasionally ask the Tsar for guidance when a “hermaphrodite” was discovered. In 1837, sketches of a   43.  While some intersex people do identify as male or female, many experience their gender as being neither or as fluid between these two options.

Yet in Russia, the Church has always been subservient to the political state and was violently persecuted between 1918 and the 1980s, when its existence did not serve secular political ideology. Id. Furthermore, the Church was sometimes opportunistically used to further governmental objectives: in Meyers Final Note (Do Not Delete) 5/24/2019  1:55 PM 116 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 26:109 2019 “double-sexed” peasant child were sent to Tsar Nikolai I, who ordered local doctors and officials to monitor the child’s health, protect them from harm, and ultimately preserve their body for medical study upon the individual’s death.52 Secular authorities embraced “administrative improvisation” when intersex people were brought to their attention, sometimes obtaining a doctor’s opinion as to their sex, and sometimes ordering sex designations on birth certificates and other forms of identification to be altered.53 Early Russian methodology in dealing with intersexuality was marked by social and scientific interest, yet also conscious ambivalence and a seeming lack of urgency. The autocracy of the Empire served as a sort of protective measure as well: public health was a prerogative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the tsars declined to give medical authorities free reign over intersex bodies.54 Some historians have also argued that doctors may have been reluctant to pathologize intersex people and other social deviations, including LGBT individuals, because the doctors, conscious of their shared status as powerless subjects beneath the tsar, identified and empathized with such marginalized patients.55 As technology advanced towards the close of the nineteenth century, Western Europe and the United States doubled-down on the Roman model—prioritizing the determination of which binary sex an intersex person was closest to and confining them in that role—by identifying one’s gonads as the foolproof indicator of their “true sex.”56 The necessity of identifying “true sex” was driven in part by homophobia: the notion of an intersex person with testes inadvertently marrying a biological male was a source of shock and horror to Western sensibilities.57 Western therapy involved invasive surgery to identify the gonads (testes or ovaries), followed by imposing the corresponding “true sex” upon the patient: people who had lived for decades as women were forcibly transformed socially and medically into men, and vice versa, leading to predictably devastating (and, in terms of a neat Romanesque remedy, inadequate) results.58 Late tsarist Russian doctors flatly rejected the “age of the gonads,” which disregarded psychology and non-gonadal anatomy, and approached intersexuality far “more tentatively, less confident in their ability to reveal a ‘true sex’ in their patients.”59 Fundamentally, Russian society proved more willing to  1941, for example, Stalin revived the Church to intensify patriotism and support for the war effort against Nazi Germany.

Records show that when confronted with an intersex patient who had lived most of their life as a man, yet was found to have primarily female genitalia, both physicians and legal scholars were unwilling to pronounce them a woman; instead, the designation of “sexless” was used.60 While “sexless” may sound insensitive to modern ears, nowhere was an intersex person safer than in a regime that allowed them to remain unique. None of the above is intended to suggest that intersex Russians were never stigmatized, experimented upon, or discriminated against; the actions and prejudices of individual doctors, local communities, and citizens are often rendered invisible to the historical lens. Yet the overarching Russian approach to the “problem” of intersexuality was an acknowledgement that neither science nor law offered easy answers. Western doctors were fixated upon the pathologizing and erasure of intersexuality, hacking away at nonbinary bodies until they fit into boxes labelled “male” or “female.” Meanwhile, the attitude towards intersex Russians during the rule of the tsars can best be characterized as cautious, ambivalent, and at times gloriously modern. B.  Freedom in Revolution In February of 1917, the Russian Empire and its centuries of rulership was dismantled virtually overnight.61 When the Bolsheviks came to power, they brought with them a determination to obliterate every relic of what they considered institutional oppression, including norms of gender and sexuality. Marriage was declared a secular (not religious) union, and divorce, abortion, and homosexuality were decriminalized.62 The tsarist family unit, decried as a patriarchal microcosm of oppression under feudalism and the Empire, was reinvented to accommodate personal choice, increasing rights for women and sexual minorities.63 Intersex Russians benefited enormously from this socialist vision for society. In 1918, Bolshevik leadership launched the People’s Commissariat of Health, which served as a far more permissive overseer of medical professionals than the tsars.64 Medical technology had flourished during the First World War, and out of this innovation appeared a novel kind of patient: the intersex person voluntarily seeking medical advice and treatment.65 Russia suddenly had something very new to offer her intersex citizens: the opportunity to choose their own social role and anatomy and to have that vision realized. Motivated both by the desire to help their patients and to advance medicine, doctors worked with intersex patients to   60.  Id. at 138.  61.  FREEZE, supra note 37, at 273.  62.

Stabilizing the patients’ claims to their existing social sex—their gender role as they performed it in the community—by use of cosmetic surgery made ideological and practical sense.67 Some intersex Russians sought out doctors to remedy body dysphoria, infertility, marital discord, physical pain and discomfort, and social exclusion.68 Some identified as one sex or the other, and wanted their anatomy to match; others saw their peers living “normal” lives, and wanted such experiences for themselves.69 Medical records from the early socialist years reveal intersex men who sought the removal of mammary glands, intersex women who requested the widening and deepening of the vaginal canal to allow for painless intercourse, and intersex people of all identities who requested that unwanted gonads be removed.70 Interestingly, Russian surgeons often expressed hesitance to remove larger-than-average clitorises, indicating concern for their patents’ future sexual pleasure; it was the patients, rather than the doctors, who frequently insisted on such modifications.71 Crucially, if there is any evidence of doctors seeking out unwilling intersex patients to experiment upon, it is not easily found in English-language academic literature. The Bolshevik agenda of furthering social satisfaction and integration only necessitated treating patients who wanted treatment. Of course, medical transformations would have been a hollow victory without corresponding legal validation. In 1926, the People’s Commissariat of Health issued a circular on intersexuality, in which “[c]itizens with characteristics   66.  ROLDUGIN, supra note 48.  67.  HEALEY, supra note 44, at 156–57.  68.  See id. at 142–49. It is important to distinguish here between the Western model, which involved selecting a sex for someone and imposing surgery and social roles upon them, and the pattern that emerged in Russia of intersex individuals themselves seeking out medical advice and treatment. While Western doctors were making life-altering decisions for their patients, in Bolshevik Russia intersex patients were the ones exercising agency, and their doctors were often hesitant to operate at all.  69.  Id. at 146. It should be noted here that while being intersex is increasingly accepted to be a natural biological variation and not a “disorder,” some intersex people still choose to seek medical intervention (hormones, surgery, therapy, etc.) for a variety of reasons. Aleksander Berezkin, for example, chose to start taking testosterone supplements after he discovered he had Klinefelter syndrome. Kondratenko, supra note 4. As long as these treatments are fully informed and consensual, they play a pivotal and beneficial role in the pursuit of full rights for intersex people. Furthermore, the decision to pursue medical treatment is not necessarily concurrent with a renunciation of one’s identity as an intersex person. For example, one may choose to have unwanted breast glands removed, yet still identify as being a combination of sexes (or neither sex at all) as opposed to being male.  70.  Id. at 142–49.  71.

Some Russian doctors used their newfound freedom under the People’s Commissariat of Health to explore the Western concept of gonads indicating “true sex,” although they quickly concluded that gonads were one aspect, rather than the ultimate indicator, of sex.74 Furthermore, there were procedures that failed, patients who perished, and technological barriers that rendered certain results impossible.75 Yet on the whole, early revolutionary medicine demonstrated remarkable scientific aptitude and a nuanced understanding of sex and gender. This rejection of Roman and Western conceptions of intersexuality was a staple of Russian society through changing centuries, regimes, religions, and political ideologies. It was not until the 1930s and the rise of Stalinism that this longstanding tradition was abandoned, and protections for intersex Russians were steamrolled by Western gender philosophy. C.  Conformity and Eyes Toward the West The sun set on the Bolshevik sexual revolution in the mid-1930s, and the blaze of burgeoning intersex rights was extinguished as well.76 Unparalleled social liberation had led to a proliferation of divorces (which quickly outpaced marriages within the same time frame), out-of-wedlock births, and the expenditure of energy through sexuality rather than collectivist labor to serve Mother Russia.77 The totalitarian backlash, seized upon to redeem Russian society, was merciless. The rise of Stalinism summoned a new mythology, that of the New Soviet Man, an unquestionably masculine creature that was the physical embodiment of the power of the State.78 As the family had enabled feudalism under the tsars, Stalinism crafted the familial unit into a mechanism for social control and increased production, centering each member’s role on their function within communism: the male as the patriotic laborer and the female as the birther of   72.

In one of his numerous scholarly works, Aleksander Berezkin noted that “[a]s an expression of human individuality and variability, intersex no longer fit into the new Soviet collective order.”82 Legal avenues to changing identification documents, while not eradicated completely, became increasingly difficult to access. In the 1940s, legal reform to advance “socialist legality” established that nonbinary citizens would have to apply in the courts—rather than registry offices—for document changes; this required a plethora of paperwork that usually proved prohibitive.83 Much later, in 1974, a decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR assigned the responsibility to alter passports to the issuing offices, but doctors, who were needed to certify that such changes were appropriate, voiced complaints that “mentally unstable patients” should not be permitted to trouble administrative entities with such requests.84 Most harmfully, in the 1950s, the medical community’s gaze once again settled squarely on the intersex community. Prior to the mid-twentieth century, “Russian tsarist and Soviet doctors seldom saw the infant hermaphrodite as an acute medical emergency.”85 What changed this was no Russian invention, but the work of the infamous American psychologist John Money, whose misguided research on sex and gender sent ripples across the globe.86 John Money, practically   79.

The evolution traced above—from uncertainty and relative protection, to revolutionary self-determination, to stigma and silence, to pathologization and mutilation—leads directly to the injurious social and legal scheme in which intersex Russians now find themselves. In the gradual dismemberment of intersex rights through the twentieth century, Russia tragically abandoned the values which had often defined East Slavic civilization since Kievan Rus’: effective scientific innovation, social progress, and fierce independence. III. THE CRUEL CURRENT STATE OF INTERSEX RIGHTS IN RUSSIA “My personal position is that society must keep children safe.” - Vladimir Putin88 The modern reality of intersex rights in Russia is a bleak affair. Utterly devoid of legal protections, defined as disabled, purposefully shielded from truthful information concerning intersexuality, and prohibited from changing their sex on identification documents, intersex Russians born since the 1950s face intersexuality’s worst persecution in known East Slavic history. A.  Bodily Autonomy In 2009 in the southern Russian city of Rostov, Oksana and her husband welcomed their child into the world.89 Their son, whom they named Alexander,  upbringing sufficiently reinforced the desired gender. Id. In efforts to prove his thesis, Money did not limit his experimentation to intersex children. Id. After Bruce Reimer, one of two male twins, lost his penis in a botched circumcision in 1966, Money convinced Bruce’s parents that their son could not hope to function in society as a male without a penis, and that the best option was to surgically transform him into a girl. Id. Thus Bruce became Brenda, and was raised by his parents as a female. Id. Despite years of hormones, social reinforcement from his parents, and “therapy” administered by Money (which involved Money forcing Bruce and his twin Brian to simulate sexual acts on each other, roleplaying traditional “female” and “male” positions), Bruce never felt like a female. Id. After learning the truth from his parents as a teenager, Bruce began living as a male and adopted the name David. Id. Despite the obvious failure of his methods, Money continued to laud his achievements—illustrated with falsified data—to the global scientific community, in the process condemning countless children to fates similar to David Reimer’s. Id. Sadly, David was plagued by depression and substance abuse for the rest of his life and ultimately committed suicide in 2004.

Oksana and her husband declined and committed to caring for their child however the doctors advised. Over two years, Alexander underwent additional examinations and preparations for his gender reassignment surgery. Finally, in November of 2011, after a seven-hour procedure, Oksana brought her child home from the hospital once again: this time, as a girl named Ksenia.92 It was not Ksenia, nor even her parents,93 who decided her fate: it was “a consilium of specialists”—working in the shadow of John Money’s legacy, and that of longstanding Western tradition—who insisted Ksenia’s chromosomes demanded wholesale transformation of her body. Oksana expressed relief once Ksenia’s transformation was complete: “She will have to take hormones for the rest of her life, but I’m so happy that we’ve left this nightmare behind.”94 Yet Oksana and her husband also harbored trepidation, fearing that Ksenia would one day discover the secret of her intersexuality and hoping that they had made the right choice for their child. At the time of their 2011 interview with a Russian newspaper, which applauded the surgery, two-year-old Ksenia actively rebelled against the dresses and other “female” clothes she now had to wear; the journalist noted that “[s]itting on the floor among scattered dolls, her hand still reaches for toy cars.”95 There have been no subsequent interviews to see how Ksenia, now nearly ten years old, has adapted to the anatomy and identity chosen for her.

My doctors never explained anything honestly to me. When I would ask why my breasts still wouldn’t grow even with hormones, they always just told me I should eat more and it would happen.100 Current Russian law is not simply permissive of medically unnecessary, nonconsensual surgeries and other harmful treatments for intersex people: it explicitly endorses them. Russian federal law on the Fundamentals of Protection of the Public Health recommends to parents of intersexual newborns a specific medical protocol, including surgery, based on their child’s diagnosis.101 While this model of treatment is slowly fading out of practice in many parts of the developed world, Russian doctors still proudly acclaim their work as a social and scientific triumph.102 In news articles, medical journals, and YouTube videos, Russian doctors boast about their mastery of the procedures and how they are the best mechanisms by which to further the patients’ social integration and mental health.103 It is important to note that proponents of early intervention to “normalize” intersex anatomy do not necessarily have sinister motivations. Many doctors, parents, and politicians genuinely believe that by transforming an intersex child into a “normal” male or female and by concealing an intersex diagnosis from them they are sparing the child from a lifetime of bullying, self-consciousness, and lack of heteronormative sexual activity.104 They believe that if the child can simply become male or female, fitting into neat philosophical boxes descending from Roman law, both society and the individual will be better off.  and shares deep East Slavic roots with Russia dating back to Kievan Rus’.

Thousands of intersex advocates from six continents have lamented the lifelong scars, both physical and emotional, that they carry from nonconsensual medical intervention. Tiger Devore, born in the United States in 1958, remembers spending summer vacations in the hospital as he suffered more than a dozen surgeries before the age of ten, procedures he calls “unnecessary failures.”106 Michael Reiter of Germany was born with external male anatomy but female chromosomes—the same condition as Oksana’s child Ksenia—and recalls his furious distrust of his parents and medical professionals.107 He remembers countless unwanted and invasive examinations, and felt that his parents were “conspiring” with doctors to surgically transform him into a female against his wishes.108 Professor Alice Dreger of the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago does not foreclose the opportunity that some intersex people are happy with the nonconsensual treatment they received in accordance with Money’s research, but noted that “if they’re out there, I haven’t met them.”109 Nonetheless, current Russian law remains supportive of Money’s teachings and the pathologizing of intersex bodies originating in Roman law. No laws have been construed to either ban or regulate intersex surgeries in any circumstances nor to ensure access to honest medical treatment or consultations.110 A federal bioethics law, proposed in 2001, would have mandated written consent by parents or guardians in cases of “gender correction” in “children up to 16 years,” but even this very minor improvement failed to pass in the Duma, the Russian legislature.111 Yet this does not mean that Russian law is devoid of patient protections.

In addition to the trauma stemming from the invasiveness and sometimes poor results of the surgeries themselves, there is always a risk that the patient may ultimately not identify with the sex they are assigned. Through his activism, Aleksander Berezkin “personally know[s] four Russian intersex people whose gender, chosen by a doctor in childhood, doesn’t fit their personalities.”117 The consequences of such crises, he observes, are alcoholism, attempted suicide, and deep depression.118 Aleksander’s experiences are consistent with reports generated by the UN, WHO, and other international organizations, which strongly recommend bodily autonomy for intersex children.119 While some nations may now allow a child to grow and determine their own sex—as Russia once did—modern Russian doctors insist that their country’s norms are fundamentally different, and that intersex rights cannot thrive there: “[w]e live completely in other realities. Therefore, doctors are forced to take responsibility . . . .”120  Indeed, the Russian medical community continues to “take responsibility” for eradicating nonbinary variations with a lack of self-consciousness or recognition that the models under which they operate are distinctly Western in origin.

The Russian Ministry of Health praised the surgery on their website, proclaiming it “groundbreaking.”122 As Western nations are slowly coming to recognize their mistakes, Russia is still emulating them. This disregard for bodily autonomy and one-dimensional understanding of sex is not only scientifically inaccurate, but also an importation of Roman, Western European, and American law and policy that is often inconsistent with historical Russian conceptions of intersexuality. B.  Intersex as a Disability Despite growing international recognition that nonbinary bodies are a natural occurrence and not necessarily harmful to the individual,123 intersexuality in Russia is legally classified as one of many “disorders of sexual development.”124 This label of disability does not carry with it any protection from discrimination, but instead subjects intersex Russians to prejudice in employment and at both ends of the adoption process, preventing intersex children from being chosen by families and intersex adults from adopting.125 “Disorders of sexual development,” if discovered in utero, can lead some parents to selectively abort intersex fetuses.126 Furthermore, the cultural and legal understanding of intersexuality as a disability to be shamed and corrected contributes to the acceptance of nonconsensual surgeries. To facilitate treatment of intersexuality as a disability, the federal government has issued five standards of care, none of which include comprehensive psychological support.127 Instead, these standards assign different degrees of “disability” depending upon one’s diagnosis, identify procedures (including surgeries on infants) which are paid for by the government, and advise psychosexual therapy to shape identities and sexual orientation.128 For example, a child who has been surgically assigned as male is often directed to attend free consultations with an andrologist, who coaches him on “how to behave himself as a man”; this therapy is designed to craft overtly masculine, heterosexual patients and does not allow for the possibility that the child may not identify as male or straight.129 Furthermore, a diagnosis of intersexuality triggers secrecy and censorship.

I was seriously depressed and I hated myself . . . .”131 Without access to open and honest medical counselling, intersex Russians cannot make informed decisions regarding their healthcare and falsely believe that they are without intersex peers or global support. Secrecy did not alleviate Aleksander or Irene’s social or physical trauma, nor erase their intersexuality, as advocates of Dr. Money’s practices might hope it would; instead, it exacerbated their hardships. This atmosphere of silence is not only cultural, but also legal. Russia’s federal law “for the Purpose of Protecting Children from Information Advocating for a Denial of Traditional Family Values,” referred to as the anti-gay law by Western nations, was unanimously approved by the Duma in 2013 and outlawed the dissemination of “propaganda” promoting “non-traditional” relationships or sexual orientations.132 While intersexuality is not explicitly mentioned in the law, positive information about nonbinary bodies is heavily censored; Wikipedia pages and other resources for intersex Russians are bare and unhelpful, and support groups are virtually nonexistent.133 Intersex Russians who have not had their anatomy “normalized,” when they are acknowledged in the media at all, are portrayed as rare and grotesque.134 Irene, now an advocate for intersex rights, keeps a playlist of news stories and television shows about “monstrous hermaphrodites” handy for when she “wants to get mad and get motivated.”135 Furthermore, the Russian word for “intersexuality” (Romanized, interseksual’nost’) implicates sexual behavior or orientation rather than biology, and suffers from this association.136 Many Russians do not understand the difference between homosexuality, transgenderism, and intersexuality and perceive them as nebulously “not normal” and intrinsically dangerous to Russian society.137 Without an understanding of the very real physical dangers facing intersex children, the urgency of reform, or the Russian tradition of rejecting harmful and oversimplified Roman and Western law, the apathy of the Russian public is itself a daunting barrier to intersex rights. Secrecy and stigma are not just harmful at the individual level; they hinder the progress of intersex rights nationally and globally as well.     130.  Marusic, supra note 2.  131.  Id.  132.

Legal Documentation Julia Pustovit of Ukraine, the first modern intersex advocate in Eastern Europe,138 is afraid. She is afraid to leave her home at night, afraid to visit doctors, and afraid that her true identity will never legally belong to her.139 After years of living as a gay man, and then as a transgender woman, she finally discovered that she was intersex later in life. Since the 2000s, Julia, now forty years old, has been trying to legally change the sex on her passport from male to female, the sex she identifies more closely with. The barrier is seemingly an insurmountable one: currently under both Ukrainian and Russian law, changing one’s sex designation is only possible if you are diagnosed with “transsexualism,” requiring numerous medical and psychological opinions and surgical transition into one’s desired sex.140 Intersex people have two choices: embrace the label of transgender and submit to unwanted surgery (often for at least the second time in their lives), or remain robbed of their true identity. This choice is complicated by the fact that surgical transition into one sex or the other often involves forced sterilization, as testes, ovaries, and/or uteruses must be removed.141 Additionally, the removal of gonads may necessitate lifelong hormone replacement therapy, which can be costly and have dangerous side effects.142 Finally, relinquishing one’s identity as intersex and becoming transgender means giving up any medical or financial benefits they received as a legally disabled person.143 As Julia struggles to change this dilemma, she still has to live as a legal man, making her life as an intersex person, harrowing to begin with, even more challenging. When she travels, she has to explain why she is dressed as a woman.144 When she gets sick, “the doctors are not interested in where I have pain but rather in why I look the way I look. And the discrepancy between my appearance and the sex in my passport makes the situation more difficult.”145 Julia, who dodges insults and physical threats from transphobic strangers, lives with her mother. “It’s not my fault, but I feel very guilty because Julia is suffering,” Julia’s  mother says. “I am trying to make her life easier as best as I can. Our children don’t ask to come into this world. We bring them. So we are responsible for them.”146 Before the 1930s, Russia had a tradition of protecting intersex citizens: there was a hesitance to pathologize intersex bodies, cooperation between patients and doctors to make informed and consensual medical decisions, and accessible pathways to changing identification documents.

IV. REFRAMING RUSSIAN HISTORY, LAW, AND VALUES TO ADVANCE INTERSEX RIGHTS “We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord’s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.” - Vladimir Putin147 When abolitionists fought to end slavery in the United States, they did not form their arguments solely around legal analysis: they also drew upon moral justifications, religious beliefs, and historical ideals of liberty and equality to advocate for change.148 Similarly, Islamic feminists and other advocates for women’s rights in the Middle East have argued that social, economic, and legal rights for women are supported by the Quran and Islamic history.149 For the elevation of intersex rights to succeed in Russia, it cannot be merely legalistic or foreign in nature; change must come in the form of a homegrown movement with nationalistic roots. With an eye to East Slavic history and tradition, it becomes clear that intersex rights are not a departure from but a return to longstanding Russian values, and one that can be incorporated into existing Russian law and society. A.  Avenues to Reform Under Existing Russian Law Russia’s legal system is best understood as civil law and generally does not place value on case precedent; courts may come to radically disparate conclusions on the same issue.150 The exception to this rule is that decisions of the Constitutional Court151 are considered quasi-sources of law by Western scholars,   147.

This is the highest court in the Russian judiciary. It handles questions concerning whether Meyers Final Note (Do Not Delete) 5/24/2019  1:55 PM 130 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 26:109 2019 as they are binding (even upon the President and the Duma) and cannot be challenged by any other court.152 The heart of Russian jurisprudence are statutes and the Constitution of the Russian Federation, enacted in December of 1993. No laws or other legal acts may contradict the Constitution, although interpretations of the Constitution and whether a given law is consistent with it may be argued in the Constitutional Court.153 The Russian legal system has long faced criticisms of unjust rulings and political influence, and indeed “possesses both a statist and a pragmatic streak that have resulted in decisions that have significantly enhanced the direct and implied powers of the presidency.”154 While the judiciary is ostensibly equal in power to the legislature and presidency, the courts still often act de facto as an instrument of the state, and their rulings reliably dovetail with the political climate.155 Former judges, including those who served in the Constitutional Court, have publicly stated that there is no independent judiciary in Russia.156 However, this does not mean that legal justifications are worthless in advancing human rights, only that they must be culturally and politically expedient as well. Once support for intersex rights can be found in Russian law, the challenge that remains is cultivating political will to enforce it. Several provisions of the Constitution’s Rights and Freedoms of Man and Citizen provide a legal foundation for intersex rights, which activists have seized upon. Article 21 expressly provides that “[n]o one shall be subject to torture, violence or other severe or humiliating treatment or punishment. No one may be subject to medical, scientific and other experiments without voluntary consent.”157 Given the well-documented medical risks associated with intersex surgeries158 and the experimental nature of assigning someone a gender without knowing how they will identify later in life, medically unnecessary intersex surgeries fit squarely within the scope of Article 21. Thus, as the law requires voluntary consent before such experimentation, such surgeries should be postponed until intersex individuals are old enough to give informed consent. The Constitution also  laws are compliant with the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Id.  152.  Id.  153.  Id.  154.

Meyers Final Note (Do Not Delete) 5/24/2019  1:55 PM “TRAGIC AND GLORIOUS PAGES”: THE EVOLUTION OF INTERSEX RIGHTS IN RUSSIA 131 ensures that “[h]uman dignity shall be protected by the State,”159 and that “[m]aternity and childhood, and the family shall be protected by the State.”160 These provisions implicate the controversial consent issues entangled with the intersex rights movement: while parents are often given deference in making medical decisions for their children, the state also has an interest in protecting the health of children and the familial unit.161 It follows that considering the significant risks and lack of medical necessity, parents should not be permitted to consent to unnecessary “normalizing” surgeries on their children’s behalf. Furthermore, the Constitution provides for “the equality of rights and freedoms” regardless of sex.162 If intersexuality is understood to be a distinct type of sex, as it was in tsarist and Bolshevik Russia,163 then this provision supports antidiscrimination legislation for intersex Russians, as well as accessible documentation changes (which are provided for transgender individuals).164 Moreover, all of the above-mentioned “[f]undamental human rights and freedoms are inalienable and shall be enjoyed by everyone since the day of birth,” therefore no child would be too young to receive shelter under constitutional provisions.165 The bodily autonomy, legal protection, and self-determination of intersex Russians would be established from birth. While constitutional interpretation is ultimately a political beast in Russia, intersex rights can be readily supported by the text of the Russian Constitution. Any statutes that conflict with such a reading—including recommendations for nonconsensual surgery and the federal standards—would necessarily be declared unconstitutional and void. Accordingly, intersex advocate and lawyer Ilya Saveliev has repeatedly argued that Russia’s Federal law on the Fundamentals of Protection of the Public Health, which recommends nonconsensual infant surgeries, violates the Constitution.166 Ilya is careful not to contest the Public Health law generally, nor to criticize Russian law or politics as an institution; he instead couches his objections in the context of intersex rights, and the consent issues implicated therein: “[u]sually this scheme is more or less balanced, but intersex newborns are an exception. In this case, very fundamental interests of a human being are involved.”167 Intersex advocates like Ilya also argue that Russia’s current position on intersex rights conflicts with international organizations in violation of Russian law and precedent.168 The Russian Constitution “is far more accommodating of international law than the U.S. Constitution, and the Constitutional Court has either relied on or cited decisions by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)   159.

The advancement of intersex rights would not necessitate an overhaul of existing Russian law, nor would it undermine the Russian judiciary. On the contrary, intersex rights are consistent with societal concerns for informed consent, protecting children and the family, and improving human rights, which are enshrined in the Constitution and other laws. Legal precedents supporting intersex rights undeniably exist already in Russian law; the challenge is fueling political will to embrace them. B.  Moving Forward, Looking Back In modern Russia, nationalistic ideations of the past are in vogue. Government officials have marketed themselves as present-day versions of tsars, channeling the peacemaking and stabilizing effect of successful historical rulers.171 The Slavic Native Faith, an ancient pagan religion that long predates the Russian Orthodox Church, has seen a healthy proliferation in recent years.172 And Vladimir Putin’s presidency has been characterized by the romanticization of Russian tradition and a rejection of the imposition of Western values on the Russian society or state.173 In a cultural moment when history is politically expedient, progress can often be best bolstered through associations with the past. Advancing intersex rights would be nothing new for Russia. Since Kievan Rus’, East Slavic society has valued technological innovation, social progress, and fierce independence in developing law and policy. During the Empire, Russian doctors and authorities expressed skepticism of Roman Law, which overconfidently sorted nonbinary bodies into two (ostensibly) tidy piles. During the Bolshevik Revolution, Russian doctors pioneered the perspective that intersexuality was a holistic phenomenon and worked with their patients to maximize their quality of life. It was not until the 1930s and the rise of Stalinism   169.  Pomeranz & Rojansky, supra note 154.  170.

But we will carry out this process ourselves, taking into account all our specific characteristics, and do not intend to report to anyone on the progress we make.’”). Meyers Final Note (Do Not Delete) 5/24/2019  1:55 PM “TRAGIC AND GLORIOUS PAGES”: THE EVOLUTION OF INTERSEX RIGHTS IN RUSSIA 133 that Russia embraced the Roman model to advance greater social control and labor production, and not until the 1950s that John Money’s methods made their way ominously across the Atlantic. By accepting these foreign practices—and by refusing to abandon them when they proved ineffective—Russia did a tremendous disservice to both its intersex citizens and its legacy as an East Slavic state. Prohibition of medically unnecessary surgeries before the patient can legally consent would be consistent with tsarist-era hesitance to pathologize intersex bodies and Russian understanding of intersexuality as a holistic phenomenon not ruled completely by gonads or chromosomes.174 Transparency in medical treatment and consultations would emulate Bolshevik doctors’ role as trusted and empathetic advisors.175 Legal protection from discrimination due to sex characteristics would, once again, establish the state as a protector of intersex citizens, as the tsardom was long ago.176 And accessible changes to identification documents with a third-sex option would be consistent with both tsarist and Bolshevik practices facilitating document alterations, as well as recognition that being intersex could be an identity in and of itself.177 Moreover, all of these reforms would symbolize a resurgence of traditional Russian rejection of Roman and Western ideologies, which have now proved medically obsolete.178 This transformation—embracing surgical prowess, but only in the most appropriate and effective situations; furthering social progress not towards lawlessness but towards healthier, more productive intersex bodies; and elevating Russian innovations over those of the West—would greatly benefit both Russia’s intersex citizens and society at large. Finally, unlike nonconsensual surgeries and rigid Roman conceptions of sex and gender, intersex advocacy is not a Western import. In 2013, Aleksander Berezkin, after consulting with Julia Pustovit, founded the Association of Russian Speaking Intersex (ARSI), the first intersex advocacy organization in the country.179 ARSI has since recruited lawyers, psychologists, writers, and other professionals to help connect with intersex Russians, provide them with resources, and spread awareness of intersexuality as a natural phenomenon.180 Lawyer Ilya Saveliev currently works for ARSI and attends demonstrations and conferences around the globe.181 And Irene Kuzemko, who first learned she was intersex through a Buzzfeed video, co-founded Intersex Russia in 2014, an organization based in Moscow that seeks to combat the isolation, stigmatization, and censorship of the intersex experience.182     174.

In the meantime, intersex Russians have not resigned themselves to martyred, reclusive lives. They have seized, fiercely and innovatively, routes to truth and community in their homeland and beyond. “Learning the truth was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Irene revealed, “[a]fter all these years of not understanding what was wrong with me, for the first time in my life, I knew I wasn’t alone.”183 V. CONCLUSION “Everything will probably never be okay. But we have to try for it.” - Vladimir Putin184 There are tragic and glorious pages in every history. They turn forward, then lapse back, carrying with them lives that are saved or savaged in the shuffle. There are no easy answers to institutional discrimination and dismemberment. This Note does not attempt to trace the logistical steps involved in transforming Russian law to advance intersex rights. Rather, this Note illustrates that such advances would not be some newfangled foreign ideal; they would be rooted in science, socially astute, and emblematic of Russian policy through the ages. Advocates like Aleksander, Irene, Julia, and Ilya have not undertaken a mission to destroy East Slavic values, but a campaign to make their homeland survivable for up to two and a half million185 intersex Russians. They have worked tirelessly—through trauma, across decades, in exile—as architects of their own destinies. Foundationally, the intersex advocates who have endured such pain and erasure are not so unlike Mother Russia herself: natural, complex, capable, and unfailingly resilient.     183.  Id.  184.
