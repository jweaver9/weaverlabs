In this, our third edition,we can report that in 2010 there were 713 grants totaling US $35,467,361 made by 64 funders worldwide (up from 40 in 2007).There is of course some peril in comparing 2010 numbers to 2007 numbers. Our findings must be taken togetherwith the knowledge that the value of the dollar, the global economy, and local, regional, and global politicalclimates have all undergone significant changes in the last three years.We must recognize that we are up against a competing stream of support for LGBTI-related issues: US-basedevangelical Christian entities who have thrown both political and economic weight behind initiatives like Uganda’santi-homosexuality bill which seeks to expand existing punishment to the death penalty. Simply put, we need more allies and more resources. To that end, we include in this edition of A Global Gazeinformation we hope will facilitate more funders’ entry into the field.  Informed by conversations with humanrights and social justice grantmakers, Funding LGBTI Work: Entry Points and Considerations is designed to offersome guideposts to funders considering support of LGBTI work. We are very pleased to able to include as wellinterviews with two funders in the Global South who have begun to engage with LGBTI organizations andcommunities – one regionally, the other nationally.With each edition of A Global Gaze we are able to capture more and more grantmakers, but the information in the pages that follow is by no means exhaustive (bilateral funding is particularly difficult to track and supportgenerated through fundraising events, individual donations, bequests, etc. is not accounted for here). As we have noted in those earlier editions, this report is a snapshot of LGBTI funding in the Global South and East.We believe the data presented here, snapshot though it may be, is important in and of itself, but that its trueworth lies in the work we hope it will inform; the discussions we hope it will help generate; and ultimately theincrease in resources we hope it will help stimulate.1More importantly, these numbers, while they represent an increase in the numberof grants, dollars, and grantmakers, are dangerously insufficient. Neither the LGBTI movements in the Global South and East nor the communities that feed them can endure without more financial backing. 2OVERVI EWIN 2010, 64 GRANTMAKERS FROM 22 COUNTRIES REPORTED AWARDING 713 GRANTS TO LGBTIORGANIZATIONS AND PROJECTS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST (GSE) and organizations in the Global Northworking with international bodies and/or organizations in the GSE. These grants reached 94 countries.  Altogether,these funders awarded US $35,784,703, including six grants totaling $1,517,000 to public foundations and otherintermediary organizations for regranting1.BETWEEN 2007 AND 2010 (THE LAST YEAR GRANTS WERE TRACKED), TOTAL REPORTED GIVING TO LGBTIORGANIZATIONS AND PROJECTS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST INCREASED BY 22 PERCENT. Going backtwo more years, the total reported giving increased by 69 percent between 2005 and 2010.LGBTI Grantmaking Findings1 Please refer to Methodology section for an explanation of how data for this report (including regranting dollars) was culled and calculated.While this represents significant growth in donor support for LGBTI efforts in the Global South and East, it is important to note that this funding is still being provided by a relatively smallnumber of institutional donors and that these funds amount to only a tiny fraction of humanrights promotion and development funds being invested in these regions.☞3The total number of reported grants to LGBTI organizations and projects in the Global South and East increased by 36 percent between 2007 and 2010 (from 451 grants in 2007 to 713 in 2010).  SINCE 2005, THE TOTALNUMBER OF GRANTS HAS INCREASED BY 53 PERCENT.Sixty-four grantmakers reported providing dollars to LGBTI organizations and projects in the Global South and East in 2010, AN INCREASE OF 24 FUNDERS (37.5%) FROM 2007. Ten funders reporting grants in 2007 did notreport grants in 20102.  THIRTY-FOUR FUNDERS WHO REPORTED LGBTI GRANTS IN THE GSE FOR 2010 DID NOT REPORT ANY IN 2005 AND 2007.The average grant amount was $50,190. THE MEDIAN GRANT AMOUNT WAS $15,000. THE ELEVEN LARGEST GRANTS ($500,000+ EACH) ACCOUNT FOR 22 PERCENT OF TOTAL DOLLARS GRANTED. The thirty-one largest grants ($250,000+ each) account for 40 percent of total dollars. OF THE 11 LARGEST GRANTS, FOUR WERE MULTI YEAR, FIVE WENT TO ORGANIZATIONS IN AFRICA (ONE INKENYA, TWO IN UGANDA, TWO IN SOUTH AFRICA), TWO WENT TO ORGANIZATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA(BRAZIL AND NICARAGUA), and four — one of which was for regranting — went to organizations based in theGlobal North (Astraea Foundation, Heartland Alliance, ILGA and the RFSU Regional LGBT Network).  There was one grant of $1,000,000 in 2010, DOWN FROM FIVE GRANTS OF $1,000,000+ IN 2007.This was made by the FORD FOUNDATION to the CENTER FOR STUDY AND RESEARCH IN COLLECTIVE HEALTHbased in Brazil.

Six out of these ten funders received regranting dollars.☞TYPES OF SU PPORTPROJECT & GENERAL OPERATING SUPPORT AND REGRANTINGSeventy-two percent of all grants in 2010 went for project support, up from 65 percent in 2007. Nineteen percentof grant dollars (and 27% of grants made) went to general operating support in 2010, down from 25 percent ofgrant dollars in 2007. 6General operating support  2010General operating support  2007 19.0%25.0%01020304050607080Project support 2010Project support 2007 72.0%65.0%01020304050607080DISTRIBUTION OF LGBTI DOLLARS BY TYPE OF SUPPORT IN 2010DOLLARS GRANTED FOR GENERAL OPERATING SUPPORT FOR 2010 AND 2007DISTRIBUTION OF GRANTS FOR PROJECT-SPECIFIC SUPPORTFOR 2010 AND 2007Findings of an increase in project support  point to the continuing struggle of  groups in the Global South and East to obtain general support needed to enable them to hire staff and maintain basic officeinfrastructures or community spaces. Along with a decrease in multi year support (see below) thesenumbers reflect not only the constriction of resources available for grantmaking, but a perhaps relateddesire among funders to exert direct control over strategy and ensure measurable (if shorter-term) impact.General Support  ($6,740,505; 194 grants)Project Support  ($27,209,857; 513 grants)Regranting  ($1,517,000; 6 grants)19.0%77.0%4.0%☞DURATION GEOGRAPH IC LOCATION ORIGIN OF LGBTI DOLLARS North America and Western Europe provided 93.5 percent of all grant dollars for LGBTI efforts in the Global Southand East and work with international bodies – similar to 2007 grantmaking numbers.  That said, there have been increases in LGBTI grant dollars from other regions. In 2007 forty grants totaling $88,988 were reported asoriginating in Latin America. Three years later, indigenous funders based in Latin America reported providing sixty grants totaling $730,919. In 2007, two out of three funders making LGBTI grants to and from Africa wereactually African offices of Western and North American headquartered funders.  In 2010, four out of the fiveAfrica-based foundations making LGBTI grants in Africa are indigenous.7One year duration grants 2010  One year duration grants 2007  72.0%45.0%01020304050607080DISTRIBUTION OF GRANTS FOR ONE YEAR DURATION FOR2010 AND 2007 AS PERCENTAGEOF TOTAL GRANT DOLLARSIn 2010, 91 percent of all grants and 72 percent of total grant dollarswere for a one-year duration. In 2007, 45 percent of grant dollars werefor a one year duration.There is more than one way to assess this significant increase in the percentage of one-year grants. It may demonstrate agreater reluctance among grantmakers to provide multi yearfunding. That translates into a less stable funding base for groups and organizations on the ground.  Thesenumbers might also be an indication that more donors areincreasingly willing to support ‘higher risk’ projects and/oremerging groups even if they are not willing to commit to multiyear funding upfront. ☞ORIGIN OF LGBTI DOLLARS BENEFITTING  THE GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST BY REGION                                                                                                                                                       Dollars          % of Total          # Grants       % of Total Region                                                                                                                                      Awarded               Dollars           Awarded             GrantsWestern Europe                                                                                          $17,205,144               48.00%               226          31.70%North America                                                                                               16,276,046               45.50                  409           57.40Africa                                                                                                                    1,530,862                 4.40                       8              1.10Latin America                                                                                                       730,919                 2.00                     60              8.40Central/Eastern Europe                                                                                       26,133                 0.07                        9              1.20Middle East                                                                                                              15,000                 0.03                        1              0.01DESTINATION OF LGBTI DOLLARSLGBTI organizations and projects based in the Global North received 30.5 percent of all dollars awarded in 2010 (7.5% less than in 2007 or 2005).

More and more organizations and funderspursuing gender equity, human rights, economicjustice, access to health care, cultural work, etc. havebegun to include LGBTI issues on their agendas. The reason is simple: They want their efforts in theircore areas of concern to be as comprehensive andeffective as possible.For their part, many LGBTI activists and advocates have elected not to employ an identity-based frame forLGBTI issues out of concern about alienating allies or fomenting backlash and resistance from those whomay perceive such work as advocating for ‘specialrights.’   Instead, many organizations have begun to use a rights-based frame for LGBTI issues — anacknowledgment of commonality and of sharedclaims on human rights protections: rights to privacy,bodily integrity, self-determination; to freedom ofassociation, expression, movement; to freedom fromviolence and degrading treatment, etc. The YogyakartaPrinciples (drafted in 2006 by a group of internationalhuman rights experts) provide critical guidance here,outlining the “universality of human rights and theirapplication to all persons without discrimination” andthe application of those rights to sexual orientationand gender identity (specifically: rights to human andpersonal security; economic, social and cultural rights;rights to expression, opinion and association; freedomof movement and asylum; rights of participation incultural and family life; rights of redress andaccountability; and rights of human rights defendersthemselves). This approach has the added benefit ofgetting non-LGBTI groups to include LGBTI issues intheir agendas. It also encourages scrutiny of policiesand practices that on the surface don’t appear tosingle out individuals on the basis of sexualFunding LGBTI Work: Entry Points and ConsiderationsINCREASINGLY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FUNDERS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST ARERECOGNIZING NOT MERELY THE INTERSECTIONALITY, BUT THE INTERDEPENDENCY OF COMMUNITIES ANDPOPULATIONS IN THE REGIONS WHERE THEY FUND. SOME FUNDERS (BOTH LGBTI-SPECIFIC AND OTHERWISE)HAVE LONG SUPPORTED LGBTI ISSUES AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF MEANINGFUL, EFFECTIVE, ANDCOMPREHENSIVE RIGHTS AND JUSTICE WORK.  THERE IS A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT LGBTI RIGHTS AND LIBERATION ARE INEXTRICABLY BOUND UP WITH THE RIGHTS AND LIBERATION OF THE LARGERCOMMUNITIES THEY ALREADY FUND. UNFORTUNATELY, GRANTMAKING PRACTICES AMONG FAR TOO MANYHUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FUNDERS HAVE NOT KEEP PACE WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING AND THE URGENT WORK OF BOTH LGBTI-INCLUSIVE AND LGBTI-DISTINCT WORK IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH AND EAST IS NOT YET BEING FUNDED AT NECESSARY LEVELS.17orientation and gender identity/expression but are in fact deliberately adopted and deployed exclusivelyto surveil and punish LGBTI people. For example, there may not be legislation criminalizing homosexualconduct or gender nonconformity per se, but LGBTIpeople may be deliberately and disproportionatelyarrested and prosecuted under identity fraud, publicindecency, and loitering laws.The Yogyakarta Principles also explicitly call for“[g]overnmental and private funders [to] providefinancial assistance, to non-governmental and otherorganisations, for the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexualorientations and gender identities.”6OUTI NG YOU R FOU N DATIONContext is everything when it comes to where, when,and how out funders of LGBTI organizations andprograms can be: the region, the country, the urban orrural area; the people in the room; the location of theroom; the risks to grantees – of both visibility andinvisibility; the openness expressed to grantseekersand the cajoling that may be necessary to move aboard or long-term partners along over time.There are grantmakers active in the Global South and East whose funding of LGBTI individuals may beunknown even to them. LGBTI people are leaders onissues that cut across demographic communities and commitments: youth, labor, water rights, genderjustice, etc. They are among the rank and file thatmoves these fights forward. But failure to engagespecifically and purposely with LGBTI issues andgroups can mean erasure of these issues andindividuals and in some cases place them in jeopardy. Other grantmakers have intentionally and strategicallysupported LGBTI efforts, frontline workers, and leadersin Global South and East, but have not yet been able to be out as LGBTI funders –either due to a well-founded concern for their grantees’ safety on theground or because they are afraid of disaffecting theirown funders. Grantee wellbeing is paramount (seebelow) and keeping donors engaged is no small thing.These are legitimate concerns at the center of funders’work. At the same time, if one of the collective andultimate goals of the LGBTI grantmaking sector is theempowerment of all people, and if other funders canbe encouraged by example, it will become increasinglyimportant for funders to find to ways let their supportof LGBTI advocates, activists, and cultural workers beknown – provided they can do so without endangeringthe lives, well-being, or efforts of those individuals.POI NTS OF ENTRY  While there are distinct and unique considerations foremploying an LGBTI lens in one’s grantmaking practice,even small shifts can make a huge difference. Again,employing this lens is not about acquiring entire newareas of expertise, but about integrating LGBTI peopleinto current institutional commitments and seeing thisas vital to the success of a foundation’s work. Here arethree simple points of entry: 1. Add a line to your RFP that explicitly states eligibilityfor LGBTI-related organizations and initiatives. This is not a matter of creating a new funding area,but of being inclusive where you already fund.Likewise, mention your commitment (or at leastwillingness) to fund LGBTI communities in yourliterature and on your Web site. Crafting a grantproposal is labor-intensive and organizations6 The Yogyakarta Principles: Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, March 2007, 33.18are unlikely to apply if they do not see themselves in your materials.2. Converse with LGBTI organizations and leaders on theground and with your existing non-LGBTI grantees.With regard to the later, ask them what strategicquestions are they engaging with and how LGBTIissues might align with their current work. Are theydoing any work with LGBTI individuals or rganizationsthat you might open up a discussion with? 3. Look at your own institution’s mission and visionstatements. What’s there that might help you makethe case internally for support for LGBTI work? Do any of your operating principles, by-laws, andgovernance documents or other material referencesocial justice, ending discrimination, the universalityof human rights? What about your grantmakingcriteria? Are there barriers there that need to beaddressed? Is your workplace environment open andwelcoming to LGBTI board and staff?  Does yourfoundation have equal opportunity and non-discrimination employment policies that extend tosexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)? Do you track staff and board demographics? If so,are these efforts inclusive of SOGI information?OPPORTU N ITI ESThe data culled for this report confirms just how littlefunding is reaching LGBTI communities, organizations,programs, and projects in the Global South and East.In whatever region(s) a funder is active, there are areas in desperate need of support. That said, researchreveals significant funding gaps (geographic, issue-based, and activity-based) among the alreadyunderfunded; gaps that point to opportunities forgrantmakers looking to engage with timely and urgentLGBTI work. The Caribbean and the Pacific Islands, for example, received the fewest number of grants in the Global South and East as well as the least amount of grant dollars. Education and immigrant/migrantrights saw only 0.96 percent and 1.7percent of fundingdollars respectively. Community organizing, leadershipdevelopment, ally/solidarity building, film/video/radioproduction, fact finding/documentation/reporting,curriculum development,  all failed to crack the top-tenlist of activities funded. Grantmakers funding in the Global South and East may have unique expertise to bring to bear on LGBTIsupport. For example, most LGBTI organizationsoperate in the larger cities, but the work and the needextend far beyond the urban areas. Rural areas aresites of some extremely innovative efforts, but theyoften get overlooked – in part because strategies and visibility may look different there. There areopportunities for non-LGBTI funders already workingoutside metro areas to engage existing partners inrural areas to identify contacts and starting points forsupporting local LGBTI work.Similarly, grantmakers who are experienced in regional funding have enormous expertise to bring tobear on LGBTI work where regional rather than local or even country-based initiatives may prove moretactically advantageous, particularly when victory orprogress on one LGBTI issue might spark backlash in a neighboring country.  Grantmakers funding in the Global South and East mayhave unique expertise to bring to bear on LGBTI support.19Opportunities for funders abound. As critical asresponding to crises and human rights violations is,there are other elements to LGBTI movement buildingwork. Arts and cultural work, for example, isfundamental to structural change, yet received only2.5 percent of the funding dollars to the Global Southand East in 2010. As with other grantees, core support and multi-yeargrants are essential for LGBTI organizations. Project-based, short-term funding can hobble the efforts ofLGBTI groups that need to be nimble and, at the sametime, engage in long-term planning (not to mention be able to pay their bills and hire paid staff if theydetermine paid staff is needed). The 2008 A GlobalGaze (using 2007 data) found that 65 percent of grantswent to project support and 89 percent of grants werefor a one year duration. Three years later 72 percent ofgrants went to project support and 91 percent werefor a duration of one year.FI RST DO NO HARM Engaging in grantmaking that advances rights,respects agency, and protects advocates and activistson the ground is of course of paramount concern tofunders. This last point is particularly salient whenaddressing homophobia and transphobia. Here are afew guideposts:THINK ABOUT HOW CAN FUNDING MIGHTSTRENGTHEN RATHER THAN TEST ALLIANCES.  Bear in mind that decisions to fund different types ofwork means money reaches different segments of the community. It’s critical to be in conversation andpartnership with local funders and NGOs to ascertainthe impact (and unintended consequences) a grantmay have on the work on the ground. DON’T BE TOO QUICK TO DECLARE VICTORY AND MOVE ON. LGBTI GAINS ARE FRAGILE ANDEASILY REVERSIBLE. The organizations, individuals and communities that fight for and sustain them areand will continue to be under fire and they needcontinued support. Regression is a fact. The point is –it’s never ‘over.’ If you leave, you can bet that gains will be significantly weakened if not reversed.AS ALWAYS, BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOURGRANTEES ABOUT WHERE AND HOW YOU REVEALTHEIR INFORMATION – location, names, and anyidentifying attributes. Clear communication aroundthis is essential. Conversely, do not assume they wantto remain anonymous. Even in dangerous areas,individuals and/or organizations may want visibility –provided they have a say in how it is achieved.CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR FUNDING REGIONALLY TO OFFSET POTENTIAL BACKLASH in one country on the heels of LGBTI advancement or victory in aneighboring country.TAKE AN I NTENTIONAL STEP Wherever your foundation sits, whatever itsgeographic, demographic, or issue-basedcommitments, there is an opportunity for you toexpand the reach and efficacy of your work and tohave a significant impact in the often life-and-deathefforts of LGBTI advocates and activists. Whether youcall this work SOGI rights or human rights or sexualrights; whether you categorize it as part of yourmigrant rights, criminal justice, youth, or women’sportfolio – fund it. If you need help getting started, get in touch with one or more of the funders listed inthe back of this report – they have all been where youare now – or contact us at Funders for LGBTQ Issues. 20What prompted TrustAfrica to begin to fund LGBTI issues and communities?We have been motivated to fund LGBTI issues andcommunities because in Africa the protection of LGBTIrights has become the litmus test of the commitmentof the human rights community to advancing the full range of human rights for all citizens. Across thecontinent, including even the most democraticcountries such as Ghana and Senegal, LGBTIindividuals and groups suffer some of the mostegregious human rights abuses, exclusion,criminalization and stigmatization. Political leadersroutinely label them as “criminals” who are unworthyof human rights. In 2009 Senegal sentenced nine gay men to eight years in prison with hard labor for“homosexual activity.” In Nigeria, the government hasmade efforts to outlaw LGBTI groups and to mete out severe prison sentences for gay people who livetogether and anyone who “aids and abets” them. InUganda, the parliament deliberated a bill that includesa death sentence for people “convicted” of LGBTIpractices, and recently a prominent gay rights activist,David Kato, was brutally murdered. In Malawi, a gaycouple was sentenced to 14-year imprisonment and“pardoned” only after world-wide condemnation. In 48of the 54 countries in Africa, LGBTI rights are severelylimited at best, and completely denied at worst.In spite of such harsh legal realities (and aided bysystems of deep-seated social stigmatization), LGBTIrights have long been largely neglected by manymainstream Africa civil society organizations that workto protect and promote human rights and democracy.As a result, African LGBTI-focused groups tend to berelatively isolated within civil society as a whole.The increased discrimination against — andcriminalization of — LGBTI individuals and groups have,however, raised the visibility of these marginalized andpenalized citizens and we see this as an opportunity to help prepare the ground for strengtheningconcerted Africa-wide advocacy and increasing theprotection of the rights of LGBTI citizens.Questions & Answers with TrustAfrica TRUSTAFRICA BEGAN IN 2001 TO HELP PROVIDE AFRICANS WITH A GREATER VOICE IN THE INTERNATIONALDONOR COMMUNITY AND TO INCREASE THE PHILANTHROPIC RESOURCES THAT AFRICANS CONTROL.THROUGH AGENDA-SETTING WORKSHOPS, COLLABORATIVE GRANTS, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE,TRUSTAFRICA ENCOURAGES AFRICAN INSTITUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGESCONFRONTING THE CONTINENT, SUCH AS VIOLENCE, DISCRIMINATION, AND ECONOMIC ISOLATION.

The Board level was the easier part because the trustees are all verypassionate human rights defenders, and three of themhave suffered political detentions in the past for theirhuman rights work. At the staff level, we needed a bit more time and case-presentation. The winningargument was that, as an African Foundation, we musttackle issues and go to places that external funders are unable to handle. Taking on LGBTI issues and rightsin Africa is, therefore, a testimony to our courage andAfrican identity. That did it!What are some of the challenges TrustAfrica has faced in doing this work?The principal challenge has to do with coverage. Africais a very big and complex continent. Spatially, it is largeenough to contain all of Europe, the United States ofAmerica and China, with room to spare. While someAfrican countries are politically stable and haveimpressive democratic credentials, others are in veryfragile states and many are in the early stages ofdemocratic transition. Hence, promoting human rightsin these environments requires diverse and constantlyshifting strategies tailored to the nature of transitionand the particular conditions on the ground. The second major challenge is that LGBTI issues evokeintense emotional resistance in many Africancountries, and there are some very powerful andentrenched interest groups and stakeholders who areopposed to LGBTI rights. This risk is much higher insome countries (such as Uganda and Malawi) than it is in others (such as Senegal and Cameroon). The third difficulty concerns the organizationalweaknesses of advocacy organizations in Africa.Generally speaking, with the exception of groups in a few countries, such as South Africa and Ghana, LGBTI advocacy organizations in Africa are beset byweaknesses.How do you anticipate that funding LGBTI issues andcommunities will effect TrustAfrica’s work overall?We are at an early stage with this line of importantwork so the impact has not yet been felt, but weexpect that our decision to fund LGBTI issues andcommunities in Africa will place us on the frontlines of innovative grantmaking in Africa. We will become a reference point for funders looking to have impact, and we will become more daring in taking on toughissues that need addressing for Africa to become freer,more tolerant, and peaceful.How are you engaging in LGBTI work now?Our LGBTI work is in its initial phase and encompassesefforts to lay the ground work for:1. Increasing concerted and effective LGBTI advocacy at both the national and regional levels (focused on the most influential treaty-based institutions of Africa, such as the African Court on Human andPeople’s Rights).“We will become a reference point for funders looking tohave impact, and we will become more daring in taking ontough issues that need addressing for Africa to becomefreer, more tolerant, and peaceful.”222. Strengthening the capacities of LGBTI andmainstream human rights organizations fornetworking and coalition building, outreach andcommunications, and membership development at the national level. In addition, support will beprovided for working towards appropriate legalreforms and domestication of relevant internationalhuman rights laws and provisions.3. Protecting LGBTI victims and conducting effectiveoutreach to sustain global visibility of sexualorientation laws and challenges in Africa.In pursuit of these goals, we employ a combination of strategies. The first is constant scoping oforganizational needs and opportunities and conveningof potential partner organizations. The second is grant-making and the third is organizational capacitystrengthening. The grantmaking is focused on buildingnetworks of LGBTI advocates and communities incountries where none exist and to support theadvocacy and protection work of existing organizations.The capacity strengthening approach is both facilitativeand demand-driven, allowing our staff and consultantsto continually create and offer opportunities forgrantees to determine the type and scope of technicalassistance they need to be more effective advocates.How would you advise funders who are not currentlyincluding LGBTI issues and communities in theirgrantmaking practices?Our message to other funders who are yet to includeLGBTI issues and communities in their work is simple: This is a line of work that will produce valuableimpact on the lives of some of the most vulnerablecitizens, and this will connect you with manypromising change-agents working for social justiceacross Africa. 23What was the country’s philanthropic landscape like at the time of the Fund’s founding? Our founders were human rights defenders who sawthe established funders as operating primarily with areligious values lens; one  that emphasized alleviationof poverty  without challenging — and in fact oftenreinforcing — the societal structures that producedinequity or adequately supporting human rightscauses in our country. What was it that prompted the Fundo Brasil de Direitos Humanos to engage with LGBT issues?A belief in the indivisibility of human rights is ourguiding priniciple, and so we concentrate our effortson the most vulnerable groups and on issues notnormally supported by the Brazilian philanthropy; on grassroots organizations that don’t have access to other sources of funding. At the core of the Fund’swork is its support of groups working to combat allforms of discrimination and institutional violence. It is impossible to protect human rights when sexualdiversity is not respected. What initial steps did you take in working with the LGBT community?We began by engaging LGBT activists in conversation.These discussions revealed that while most LGBTgroups in the country were able to raise funds for HIVand AIDS and other health initiatives, foundationsupport for work related to combating homophobiaand defending the rights of LGBT people — particularlythe rights of lesbians and trans people — was muchscarcer. This gap became our opportunity; these issuesbecame part of our mission. How are you engaging in LGBT work now?First, we are making our presence known in thecommunity. We participate in São Paulo’s annual LGBTParade and Cultural Fair. In 2011, parade organizersdonated a space to Fundo Brasil de Direitos Humanoswhere we offered t-shirts, bags and post cards (weestimate that we disseminated roughly 1500postcards during this event).  We also had copies of thesix posters we produced to promote the LGBT-relatedQuestions & Answers withFundo Brasil de Direitos Humanos(Brazil Human Rights Fund)FUNDO BRASIL DE DIREITOS HUMANOS WAS ESTABLISHED TO STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT LOCAL SOCIALMOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WORKING TO PROTECT AND DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS. IT FOCUSES ITS EFFORTS ON GROUPS AND ISSUES NOT GENERALLY BACKED BY BRAZILIAN PHILANTHROPY.THE FUND BEGAN OPERATING IN 2006 AND MADE ITS FIRST LGBT GRANT IN 2007.  “THE PRINCIPLE FOR THE FOUNDATION’S ACTIONS IS THE INDIVISIBILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS.”24projects that we have supported since 2007. The goalbehind all this activity is twofold. Not only do we wantLGBT Brazilians to know about the Fund, we want toget closer to the LGBT movement; to become betterinformed of the issues and debates circulating withinthe community in order to better inform our grantproposal selection processes.  Second, we deliberately involve LGBT communitymembers in our grantmaking process.  Every year weinvite a representative from the community to serveon our selection committee (where the short-listedproposals are reviewed by special consultants). This isan essential step in the process and one aimed atbringing in a diversity of views and a deep connectionwith the issues at hand.Any advice for funders who are not currently including LGBT issues and communities in theirgrantmaking practices?We believe that any fund that works with humanrights is compelled to deal with the discriminationfaced by LGBT individuals and communities. And any foundation that truly wants to work on LGBTissues must immerse itself in the communities’debates and familiarize itself with the organizations in the areas where they fund.  Community knowledgeand expertise on the issues confronting itsmembership must be respected and sought after in grantmaking decisions. “This gap became our opportunity; these issues became part of our mission.”25Most of the data in the pages that follow was culledfrom private and public foundations and corporations:with PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS being supportedprimarily by individuals and families (often throughthe establishment of a permanent endowment), andPUBLIC FOUNDATIONS receiving support throughindividual fundraising, private foundations, and onoccasion, government sources. Where possible, we have tried to track BILATERALFUNDING – that is, government grants to NGOsand/or initiatives in countries other than their own.While government grants represent an extremelysignificant percentage of LGBTI funding in the GlobalSouth and East, precise LGBTI grants data can bedifficult to isolate from other bilateral funding. Most bilaterals do not give their LGBTI grants distinctcodes and much of this funding is decentralized, going through various agencies. CONSULATES ANDEMBASSIES may also engage in LGBTI grantmaking viatheir own budgets and portfolios.Not included in this report is MULTILATERALFUNDING – support from multiple sources provided toLGBTI-related initiatives and organizations throughinternational entities (typically United Nationsprograms and agencies and the like).Finally, critical to the process of LGBTI grantmaking inthe Global South and East are REGRANTORS ORINTERMEDIARIES – usually public foundations orNGOs based in either the donor’s or recipient’s countrythat regrant to local NGOs.  Regranting throughintermediaries has been a valuable strategy employedby foundations who have a difficult time making largenumbers of smaller grants and/or do not have strongrelationships with the NGOs on the ground, localexpertise, cultural competency, and/or knowledge oflegal and financial systems in a given region or country.Appendix A:Landscape of Funding Mechanisms26BILATERAL FUNDER A government entity thatprovides financial support to organizations andprograms in other countries.CEE Central/Eastern Europe.CORPORATE FUNDER Corporation that supports LGBTIcauses either through their companies or through theestablishment of foundations.GENDER NONCONFORMING (GNC) Having a genderidentity and/or expression that does not conform tosocietal rules and expectations associated with one’sbiological sex.

For the purposes of this report,“organization,” “group” and “non-governmentalorganization” are used interchangeably. In thegrantmaking findings section of this report, NGOrefers to non-governmental organizations withgrantmaking functions.PRIVATE FOUNDATION A foundation establishedprimarily by individuals or families, often through theestablishment of a permanent endowment.PROGRAM, PROJECT Terms used interchangeablythroughout this report to account for organizationsthat address LGBTI issues explicitly through specificactivities or initiatives.  These may be housed withinorganizations where LGBTI work is not the primaryfocus of the organization or they may be discretelyfunded activities within an LGBTI organization.PUBLIC FOUNDATION A foundation receiving supportprimarily through fundraising from individuals and private foundations. Public foundations that have a regranting function are critical actors in thegrantmaking process to LGBTI communities aroundthe world. These foundations often have both thecapacity to allocate smaller grants and a nuancedgeopolitical knowledge of various localities.REGRANTOR Public foundations or other NGO’s whoreceive grants to redistribute, usually to  small, localNGOs, sometimes referred to as an intermediary. SOGI An acronym for Sexual Orientation and GenderIdentity.TRANSGENDER A term used to describe people whosegender identity does not conform to expectationsassociated with the biological sex they were assignedat birth. Together with gender nonconforming (see above) it is used to “represent all of theinnumerable genders and forms of gender expressionthat fall within and outside of stereotypical gender norms” (Transgender Law Center,www.transgenderlawcenter.org ). For the purposes of this report, “transgender/gender nonconforming” is used as an umbrella term that differs acrossnational, regional and political contexts. (For example,other terms used within particular cultures, andpotentially categorized under a “transgender”umbrella, include kothi, travesti, two-spirit, kothay,hijra, and transsexual, among many others.)WSW Acronym for Women who have Sex with Womenand who may or may not identify as gay, lesbian,bisexual, queer, etc.YOGYAKARTA PRINCIPLES “A set of principles on the application of international human rights law inrelation to sexual orientation and gender identity.

FU N DER OUTREACHRequests for grant information were sent to 136potential LGBTI funders and data was culled from atotal of 64 funders including bilateral agencies,corporate foundations, private foundations, publicfoundations, and NGOs with funding mechanisms.In addition, we contacted a number of grantmakingassociations and networks for assistance in outreachto funders including: n AFRICA GRANTMAKERS AFFINITY GROUPn ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS IN PHILANTHROPYn FOUNDATIONS FOR PEACE NETWORKn FUNDERS CONCERNED ABOUT AIDSn GRANTMAKERS WITHOUT BORDERSn HISPANICS IN PHILANTHROPYn INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS FUNDERS GROUPn INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF WOMEN’S FUNDSn WORLDWIDE INITIATIVES FOR GRANTMAKER SUPPORT (WINGS)We also gathered data from two important researchstudies on 2010 LGBTI funding in the Global South and East. Beyond Invisibility: Latin America Women’sFunds Mobilizing for Lesbian, Bisexual and TransgenderCommunities, produced by the Central AmericanWomen’s Fund, tracked 2009 and 2010 LBT grantsawarded by six Latin America Women’s Funds.

This methodprovides better information about the purposes of thefunding, which captures both the intent of the primaryfunder and the regranting institution. Regrantingdollars are included when calculating activities fundedand in the funders listing in the Appendix D.MU LTIYEAR GRANTSIn order to reflect the priorities of LGBTI funders in anygiven year, the total amount of multi-year grants thatwere authorized in 2010 are included in the data. LIMITATIONS While the findings from the data are useful as asnapshot of LGBTI grantmaking in the Global Southand East, caution should be taken when drawingdecisive conclusions. When interpreting the resultsfrom this data, the following limitations should beconsidered:RESPONSE BIAS IN REGARDS TO LANGUAGEBecause the request for data was distributed inEnglish, potential respondents without reading fluencyin English are likely not represented in the data. OVERSTATED REGRANTED DOLLARS To calculate the amount of foundation dollars that were likelyregranted (US $1,517,000), we added the grantsprovided by LGBTI funders earmarked for regrantingpurposes. This equation rests on the assumption that all of the regranting dollars were eventuallyregranted. However, we recognize that a fraction ofthese dollars likely supported other costs (overhead, etc.).30AIDS Foundation of South AfricaPO Box 50582Musgrave, DurbanSOUTH AFRICA 4062Telephone +27-31-277-2700info@aids.org.za www.aids.org.za American Jewish World Service45 West 36th StreetNew York, NY 10018, USATelephone +1-212-792-2900ajws@ajws.orgwww.ajws.org amfAR120 Wall Street, 13th FloorNew York, NY 10005-3908, USATelephone +1-212-806-1600grants@amfar.orgwww.amfar.orgArab Human Rights FundAn-Nakheel Building8th FloorBahrain Street, Caracas DistrictBeirut, LEBANONTelephone +961-961-1-342-900info@ahrfund.orgwww.ahrfund.org    Arcus Foundation402 East Michigan AvenueKalamazoo, MI 49007, USATelephone +1-269-373-4373contact@arcusfoundation.orgwww.arcusfoundation.org  Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice116 East 16th Street, 7th FloorNew York, NY  10003, USATelephone +1-212-529-8021 info@astraeafoundation.org www.astraeafoundation.org Atlantic Philanthropies75 Varick StreetNew York, NY 10013-1917, USATelephone +1-212-916-7300www.atlanticphilanthropies.orgBarry & Martin’s Trust91 Clarendon DrivePutney, London SW15 1AN, ENGLANDTelephone +44-020-8785-1221www.barryandmartin.org Civil Rights Defenders (formerly Swedish Helsinki Committee)Stora Nygatan 26SE 111 27 Stockholm, SWEDENTelephone +46-8-545-277-30info@civilrightsdefenders.org   www.civilrightsdefenders.org Dreilinden gGmbHAlte Königstr. 1822767 Hamburg, GERMANYTelephone +49-040-380-388-13/14www.dreilinden.orgELAS- Fundo de Investimento SocialHans Staden Street21 – Botafogo, CEP 22281-060 Rio de Janeiro – RJ, BRAZILTelephone +55-21-2286-1046elas@fundosocialelas.orgwww.fundosocialelas.org European Instrument for Democracy and Human RightsWelcomeurope38 rue Leon, 75018 Paris, FRANCETelephone +33-1-42-54-60-64assistance@welcomeurope.comwww.welcomeurope.com/european-funds/eidhr-european-instrument-democracy-human-rights-598+498.htmlFilia die FrauenstiftungKönigstr old. 18 22767 Hamburg, GERMANYTelephone +49-0-40-380381-99-0info@filia-frauenstiftung.dewww.filia-frauenstiftung.deAppendix D:Directory of LGBTI Grantmaking Respondents31Fondo AlquimiaAvenida Condell 1325Providencia – Santiago, CHILETelephone +56-02-665-7106info@fondoalquimia.orgwww.fondoalquimia.orgFondo Centroamericano de Mujeres (FCAM)(Central American Fund for Women)Rotonda El, Güegüense 4 cuadras al oeste1 cuadra al norte, ManaguaNICARAGUATelephone +505-22544981info@fcmujeres.orgwww.fcmujeres.org  Fondo Mujercl 32 # 13 – 32 torre 1 of .701Bogotá D.C., COLUMBIATelephone +57-1-232-4937/340-6478info@fondomujer.orgwww.fondomujer.orgFondo de Mujeres  del SurLa Rioja 826 PB “G”, Capital 5000 Cordoba, ARGENTINATelephone +54-0351-425-2787informacion@mujeresdelsur.orgwww.mujeresdelsur.orgFord Foundation320 East 43rd StreetNew York, NY 10017, USA Telephone +1-212-573-5000www.fordfoundation.orgFund for Global Human Rights1666 Connecticut Avenue NW, Suite 410 Washington, DC 20009, USATelephone +1-202-347-7488info@globalhumanrights.orgwww.globalhumanrights.orgFundacion TrianguloSPAINcorreo@fundaciontriangulo.eswww.fundaciontriangulo.orgFunding Exchange, The666 Broadway, Suite 500 New York, NY 10012, USATelephone +1-212-529-5300information@fex.orgwww.fex.orgFundo Brasil de Direitos Humanos (Brazil Human Rights Fund)R.

    "abstract": "In 2008, when Funders for LGBTQ Issues released our last edition of A Global Gaze, we reported that total giving to LGBTI communities in the Global South and East more than doubled between 2005 and 2007, from 328 grants totaling US $10.5 million in 2005 to 451 grants totaling US $26.2 million in 2007. In this, our third edition, we can report that in 2010 there were 713 grants totaling US $35,467,361 made by 64 funders worldwide (up from 40 in 2007). There is of course some peril in comparing 2010 numbers to 2007 numbers. Our findings must be taken together with the knowledge that the value of the dollar, the global economy, and local, regional, and global political climates have all undergone significant changes in the last three years",
