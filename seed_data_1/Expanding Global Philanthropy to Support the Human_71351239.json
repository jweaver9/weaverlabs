High levels of violence, discrimination, persecution and social exclusion adversely affect millions of individuals whose sexual orientation and gender identity are seen as non-conforming — particularly in the Global South and Global East. In September 2008, a convening was held to strategize ways to increase philanthropic resources to secure and expand human rights for LGBT people.This invitational meeting of 29 individual donors, leaders of institutional foundations, human rights champions and international LGBT rights advocates was organized by the Arcus Operating Foundation (hereafter cited as Arcus), a private foundation based in Kalamazoo, Mich., with offices in New York City and Cambridge, U.K. It was also supported by the Rockefeller Foundation through the use of its conference facility in Bellagio, Italy. Participants helped develop the meeting agenda, which included discussions of the state of LGBT rights movements around the world; key impediments to securing human rights for LGBT people in the Global South and Global East; an analysis of current funding for international LGBT rights initiatives; and opportunities to increase philanthropic resources to address stigma and discrimination against LGBT people. Strategies to galvanize the human rights sector to deepen its commitment to the cause of LGBT rights were also explored. The purpose of the meeting was to forge concrete plans to meaningfully increase philanthropic resources to support vulnerable and underserved populations of LGBT people, particularly those living in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. This meeting brought together stakeholders who share the belief that LGBT rights cannot be separated from a broader human rights agenda and that international LGBT rights efforts demand more support. It resulted in a commitment to launch a coordinated initiative to increase global philanthropy for the human rights of LGBT people. Participants agreed this initiative will be constituted as a project housed at Arcus with financial support from a number of funders. Work has already commenced around resource generation and field building. Goals of the ConveningOutcomes sought were: n a measurable increase in the amount of funds from existing and new donors to support international LGBT rights; n mechanisms established for enhancing collaboration and coordination among existing and new international LGBT rights donors that result in more effective funding of LGBT rights initiatives; andn new partnerships established between donors, human rights organizations and LGBT rights advocates that lead to enhanced LGBT rights. Statement of the ProblemLGBT people in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Latin America face deep levels of economic, cultural and social marginalization, denial of basic civil and political equality, discrimination and prejudice in employment, access to social services and public institutions, denial of family recognition and protection, and extremely high levels of violence, often at the hands of state officials.1 Poverty and inequality are burdens often exacerbated by stigmas associated with disclosures of sexual orientation and gender variance. In the past five years alone, LGBT people in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world have faced: imprisonment for their sexual orientation (Egypt, Cameroon, East Africa); calls for capital punishment (Iran); high levels of violence, including threats, murder and assault (Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Africa); efforts to deny right to assembly (Nigeria); and attempts to criminalize same-sex behavior (Rwanda). The public discourse on issues of sexual orientation around the world is often waged by 1) See, e.g., Daniel Ottosson, State Sponsored Homophobia: An International Survey of Laws Prohibiting Same Sex Activity Between Consenting Adults (ILGA, April 2007); Human Rights Watch, More Than a Name: State Sponsored Homophobia and its Consequences in Southern Africa (Human Rights Watch, 2003); Cary Alan Johnson, Off The Map: How HIV/AIDS Programming is Failing Same-Sex Practicing People in Africa (IGLHRC, 2007); Cary Alan Johnson, Getting to C: An Assessment of the State of the African LGBT Movement and Some Notes on Ways Forward, unpublished paper prepared for funder meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, September 2007.Background About the Convening2Donors at the March 2007 meeting agreed on the pressing need for greater support of LGBT movements around the world. These needs were reflected in the intensity of human rights abuses, the nascent capacity of global LGBT rights organizations and the lack of uniform support from the human rights community (funders and advocates). Codifying the problems, however, was only the first step. The desire for a concrete strategy to achieve expanded resources for the international LGBT rights sector was the driving force behind the Bellagio convening.Preparation for the Bellagio MeetingThrough a process of referral and outreach to colleagues in the philanthropic, human rights and LGBT advocacy communities, 29 international leaders with a commitment to expanding global philanthropy to support LGBT rights came together in Bellagio. The following questions were established in advance of the convening to help guide the proceedings:n What are the needs of the organizations and institutions working to advance the human rights of LGBT people globally? n What challenges and opportunities exist for funders of human rights, social justice and global civil society to support human rights for LGBT people globally? n What challenges and opportunities exist for human rights organizations to advocate for human rights for LGBT people globally?n What strategies, collaborations or ideas could meaningfully increase the resources available to those working to support and advance human rights for LGBT people globally?The meeting was informed by six research studies that were commissioned and/or funded by contracts and grants made by Arcus. They are an analysis of the state of LGBT movements in the Global South and East, including threats and opportunities; an updated report on the state of funding for international LGBT rights; an overview of funding intermediaries and funding mechanisms that support the international LGBT rights sector; a mapping of international LGBT rights organizations, projects and initiatives; a report anti-gay religious leaders2 and is not yet balanced with the voices of human rights defenders. In part, this is because some of the traditional human rights and social justice groups have not fully embraced LGBT rights. Resources to advance global LGBT rights are sparse — a 2007 report released by the U.S.-based donor-affinity group Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues (FLGI), documented that only $10.5 million in funding went to support LGBT rights initiatives in the Global South and Global East in 2005.3 Forty donors, many of whom are small, human rights funders, accounted for these funds. They include the Sigrid Rausing Trust in the U.K., Oak Foundation in Geneva, Ise Bosch in Germany, Astraea Foundation in the U.S., Atlantic Philanthropies in South Africa and Ireland, and Wellspring Advisors in the U.S. LGBT rights have also been supported by a handful of European governments, such as those of Sweden (through SIDA) and the Netherlands (through Hivos).Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues (FLGI) also surveyed international LGBT rights groups and identified pressing needs for emergency support, capacity building, human rights training, coalition building, advocacy initiatives and educational programs. The study found that large foundations (private and corporate) are not providing significant support to groups working to expand LGBT rights at global or national policy levels. The implications of this report were discussed at a convening in March 2007, held in Amsterdam, co-funded by the Arcus Foundation and attended by more than 30 donor organizations. The meeting revealed that there is little coordination among donors and no network where international LGBT rights funders could exchange strategies, pool resources or work under a shared human rights framework. Further, it was noted that many human rights funders had not been fully engaged in supporting LGBT rights efforts. Individual donors — like the hundreds of people who attend gay and lesbian donor gatherings (including the annual U.S.-based OutGiving conference) — have rarely been solicited to address the needs of global LGBT populations. 2) See for example, Logos, The Baseline Study of Faith Based De-velopment in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Challenges of Non-Patriarchal Approach and Communities (Sarajevo, 2007).3) Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, A Global Gaze: LGBT and Intersex Grant Making in the Global South and East, (FLGI, New York, 2007).3about the obstacles to mobilizing additional institutional funding based on surveys and interviews with a variety of funders; and the creation of a Web portal that gathers research and reports on LGBT rights issues around the world. (See page 23 for links to the reports.)The concept paper for the convening illustrated that international LGBT rights organizations and/or LGBT rights projects of large Northern-based human rights institutions have played and continue to play an important role in supporting the advocacy and capacity-building needs of LGBT rights groups in the Global South and East. Resource scarcity renders most indigenous efforts underfunded or unfunded. Funding deficits alone, however, do not tell the full story. Though they could be a tremendous resource for local LGBT rights groups, far too few global, regional and national human rights groups have integrated an LGBT rights focus into their agenda. As a consequence, LGBT rights advocates often work with little protection from violence and discrimination and with minimal support or protection from civil society organizations in their home countries.  Anecdotally, some human rights funders have expressed a lack of familiarity with international LGBT rights issues and think it is difficult to know where or how to invest. Others have not been able to identify local LGBT rights groups that match their funding criteria (e.g., being a formally registered organization, having nonprofit status, having a developed organizational infrastructure). At the same time, due to the myriad challenges of working in hostile environments, many grassroots LGBT rights groups remain marginalized and cannot get support from philanthropic institutions.  The Bellagio meeting attempted to build a better understanding of the constraints facing LGBT rights advocates, human rights groups and funders. In particular, the meeting considered the hypothesis that if human rights organizations and funders view LGBT rights as part of the broader human rights agenda, they may give and/or increase support to LGBT rights efforts. A paradigm shift is required: Until LGBT rights are seen as inseparable from other human rights, LGBT people around the world will continue to suffer. Meeting AgendaThe meeting began on the evening of Monday, Sept. 15, with a welcome dinner and opening remarks by two global philanthropists: Jon L. Stryker, founder of the Arcus Foundation, and Ise Bosch, founder of Dreilinden Fund in Germany. A keynote address was delivered by Michael O’Flaherty, Professor of Applied Human Rights and Co-Director of the Human Rights Law Centre at the University of Nottingham (U.K.). Since 2004, O’Flaherty has been an elected member of the United Nations Human Rights Committee. He also served as Rapporteur for the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, a gathering that took place in Indonesia in 2007. The first full day of the meeting (Sept. 16) was spent assessing the state of LGBT rights and LGBT movements in the Global South and East, encompassing laws, policies and key obstacles in different regions. It also included an overview of the philanthropic landscape and funding mechanisms to support LGBT rights. Day one concluded with reflections on the barriers and opportunities to increased leadership from the human rights community in promoting LGBT rights.The second day (Sept. 17) was spent exploring the challenges donors experience in funding LGBT rights and the challenges human rights organizations experience in supporting LGBT rights. Research on strategic opportunities to increase funding for LGBT human rights initiatives was discussed. Participants also shared successful models they developed to overcome these difficulties. The final day (Sept. 18) focused on developing concrete strategies and next steps. This included creating a set of objectives aimed at marshaling new and more effective resources to support LGBT rights wherein LGBT rights are a more integrated and central part of the broader human rights agenda. including denial of access to housing, employment, social welfare and education. It is commonplace for LGBT people to face multiple forms of violation. Such infringements at the hands of state institutions have been the target of LGBT rights advocates for years, including attempts to use international treaties and formal commitments to human rights as a guide and mandate for governments to follow. O’Flaherty emphasized that abuses of LGBT people are not relegated to any one region of the world. While direct attacks may be fewer in the Global North, prejudice, subtle discrimination and malevolence are alive and well. He recounted a story in which a senior government official of a large Western country responded to criticism that transsexuals were being brutalized in that country’s detention facilities by saying he “did not recall that any of the human rights treaties actually mention transsexuals,” as if that justified the attacks. O’Flaherty noted the value that a human rights framework brings to social-change efforts. He explained that a human rights approach is based on a set of binding international legal standards, mainly contained in the network of global and regional treaties. Such a rule-based foundation means that the demands for justice and dignity are rooted in non-negotiable entitlements and are not subject to the whims of decision makers. Referencing human rights treaties has the merit of reinforcing the need for advocacy that addresses all parts of human experience, because the treaties deal with the economic, social, cultural, civil and political aspects of life. Another strength of a human rights approach, according to O’Flaherty, is that it promotes equality and combats discrimination. A human rights frame encompasses the struggle for the rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Yet the struggle cannot be entirely generalized. O’Flaherty emphasized that the situations of the most-vulnerable and at-risk persons must be prioritized. The demand for accountability and justice is central to a human rights approach. Accountability requires advocates to operate in a transparent, straightforward way that is respectful of the groups they serve. There are limitations because the systems of implementation and enforcement of human rights remain weak and unreliable, but the benefits cannot be denied. Opening RemarksJon Stryker welcomed all participants and described why Arcus was motivated to plan and produce the Bellagio meeting. He noted that as Arcus began to develop its funding strategy to support international LGBT rights, a number of problems were identified. Stryker observed that despite deep levels of violence, persecution and discrimination, there is a dearth of information and research on LGBT human rights. Limited resources further exacerbate these concerns. Arcus organized the meeting to see if committed donors and activists could develop new strategies to generate more funding for international LGBT rights groups, especially those in the Global South and East. He expressed hope that the meeting would lead to donors and human rights organizations “building networks, raising awareness, empowering voices and providing leadership” to address the human rights needs of LGBT people.Ise Bosch joined in greeting participants and talked about the historic opportunity the gathering provided to build strategic partnerships among groups that sometimes compete but are all united toward the same objective — supporting the human rights of LGBT people. As a longtime donor to international LGBT rights, Bosch outlined challenges for securing more resources — especially because some donors are reticent or unwilling to be identified with this issue. Conversely, she identified tremendous strengths in the field, including the commitment of pioneering initiatives, such as Astraea’s International Fund for Sexual Minorities, and women’s funding groups, such as Mama Cash, to support grassroots LGBT organizations. LGBT Rights Are Human RightsMichael O’Flaherty’s keynote address provided a powerful overview of how the pursuit of LGBT rights fits into a human rights framework. He asked participants to reflect on the scale of global LGBT rights infringements encompassing murder, torture, rape, forced marriage and compulsory surgical gender reassignment. O’Flaherty described the unacceptable limits on freedom of expression, assembly and religious belief that LGBT people experience. He noted that abuses are also pervasive in economic and social spheres — 4Convening ProceedingsSupport From the Yogyakarta PrinciplesO’Flaherty described a significant application of the human rights approach in the struggle for LGBT rights: the development of the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. The Principles address a broad range of human rights standards and their application to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. They affirm the primary obligation of states to implement human rights. He noted that the story of the Yogyakarta Principles is a reminder of what can be achieved in human rights-based advocacy and how funding can be calibrated to trigger impressive results. In 2006, a group of international human rights experts convened in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to address a gap in the international human rights framework. International human rights law provides an effective tool for LGBT human rights defenders to hold their governments accountable for violations and ultimately to build global consensus to defend the human rights of LGBT people. Unfortunately, international human rights law does not make any specific reference to persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities, or to human rights relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. For the first time, a set of principles was developed that deal explicitly with human rights issues relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. They represent existing international law. They do not constitute an aspirational statement, but instead offer a description of present obligations. There are some gaps, as well as uncertainties, but the results convincingly show that major new legal initiatives are not needed. Instead, the Principles illustrate there must be proper enforcement of existing law. The Yogyakarta Principles were formally launched in March 2007. While the Principles are primarily targeted at state human rights obligations, they also make recommendations to a range of international, regional and national organizations, both governmental and non-governmental. As an advocacy tool, O’Flaherty noted that the Principles are having far more success than anticipated. Human rights experts and activists have been informing and educating decision makers at national and international levels about their significance 5and usefulness. In response to these attempts at promoting the application of the Principles, some governments have endorsed or adopted the Principles, referencing them in official statements in United Nations human rights forums and in official government policy statements. For O’Flaherty, the Yogyakarta Principles are just one step in the struggle for full equality and freedom from persecution for LGBT people. Where to go from here? O’Flaherty offered the following suggestions:n The first and fundamental locus of interest must remain the grass roots — it is critical to buttress the capacity of community organizations, particularly in the Global South. The forms of assistance should include support for new and fragile groups, as well as delivery of technical assistance and capacity training. Groups should be able and welcomed to join the mainstream of human rights activism, and to employ proper methods of human rights monitoring, reporting and analysis.n Support to grassroots groups must be accompanied by broad efforts to change society. For instance, education and public-awareness campaigns are needed to combat entrenched discriminatory attitudes.n Effective advocacy at the international level demands more transnational cooperation among advocates to achieve human rights goals. It also requires a more vigorous engagement with international political and redress procedures. These forums, along with the UN and regional organizations, may leave much to be desired, but they remain the engine for shaping global policy and the enforcement of international standards. Needs of Individuals and Organizations Working to Advance LGBT Rights in the Global South and Global East and Openings for ChangeTo better understand the opportunities for and challenges to expanding philanthropy to support global LGBT rights, participants reflected on the needs of individuals and organizations working to advance the human rights of LGBT people and the barriers and tendency, such as Latin America, a key to success has been the formation of coalitions with other social movements. Such integration of sexual rights within the broader human rights frame and community is imperative. Because there are commonalities between different human rights constituencies, cooperation provides enhanced strength, safety and protection for all.n Sexuality and the body have become the battleground of cultural ideologies that spring from religion, nationalism and other fixed traditions. These ideologies portray LGBT people as being far outside the norms and boundaries of societies. Thus, challenges are not only in the arena of laws and policies but also within the more complex realm of values. This makes a holistic human rights approach all the more important, acknowledging the diversity of values not only among but also within cultures.n Stronger networks are badly needed to offset the challenges that erupt when intersecting LGBT movements create a backlash in a globalizing world. An LGBT rights victory in one country may unexpectedly trigger repressive measures in another. Groups lack structures within which they can anticipate coming challenges, share lessons learned and plan together. n While human rights principles create common ground for global LGBT rights movements, the multiplicity of identities among its members cannot be ignored. To be inclusive and effective, unique strategies are needed to reach different constituencies, in terms of sexual orientation, gender identity, class and race. Supporting only one kind of work will lead to a limited representation of the LGBT community and its needs.n In general, groups that work on sexuality and gender are under-resourced. Even those which have some project funding struggle with securing support for general operating expenses. The relatively more rich and stable funding streams for HIV lead some LGBT rights groups to adopt a health- and direct-service framework, thereby limiting their ability to pursue political advocacy. prospects they face. It is evident that LGBT people around the globe, regardless of how they define themselves on issues of sexuality and gender, are coming together to affirm their rights and desires. They often do this in the face of extreme risk. In many countries, advocating for human rights and protections for LGBT people can put advocates in severe danger from state actors, and violent and discriminatory agencies and individuals. LGBT people can be imprisoned for same-sex sexual conduct (with no precise indication of sentence length) in 76 countries, as compared to only 50 countries that have laws prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. In seven countries (including Iran, United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Mauritania), same-sex acts can result in the death penalty.  Scott Long, Director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch, presented a summary of a report he authored, entitled Together, Apart: Organizing around Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Worldwide. To be successful in fighting oppression, Long stated, the human rights movement must integrate LGBT movements into its mainstream. LGBT advocacy work around the world is undertaken by a broad range of people with vastly different identities, yet these efforts are united by a belief in every human’s intrinsic rights and the protection of values, including dignity, privacy and expression, for all. Through interviews and surveys with sexual-rights activists in the Global South and Global East, Long’s report provides a qualitative snapshot of the diverse challenges LGBT people face and the strategies they use to confront them. The findings are divided into five regions: Sub-Saharan Africa; Middle East and North Africa; Eastern Europe and Central Asia; Asia and the Pacific; and Latin America and the Caribbean. Long identified some common themes that cut across geography:n Many organizations working on sexual orientation and gender identity are isolated. In regions that have been most successful in countering this 6A Snapshot of Regional ConcernsIn reviewing and assessing LGBT rights movements across different geographical regions, Long looked at patterns of abuse reported by activists; the challenges and opportunities for actions; and key initiatives to date:Sub-Saharan Africa: Across the majority of African countries, laws penalize same-sex conduct. Such an environment promotes extortion of LGBT people by individuals and the authorities. Extortion is effective because those stigmatized for their sexual orientation or gender identity in Africa are at risk of losing their safety and community affiliations. LGBT people also experience frequent discrimination in health services. A battleground has formed across the continent where political rhetoric and religious intolerance meet. Gender and sexual nonconformity is portrayed as “un-African” and colonialist, and is often met with violence. There have been promising signs of change in terms of some stronger NGOs and national human rights institutions, which have spoken in defense of LGBT rights. There has also been expanded cross-regional cooperation among LGBT advocacy groups, such as joint lobbying at the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights. While victories are possible, advocates remain aware of the dangers they face. Police arrested and tortured three Ugandan demonstrators in mid-2008. In many countries, LGBT groups look for lower-profile ways to engage leading actors and seek change, including coalition-building efforts with other human rights constituencies.Middle East and North Africa (MENA): This region has witnessed violent campaigns to punish “deviant” sexuality and gender expression. The attacks on LGBT people are often brutal, showing a darker aim to rid society of an “offensive element.” There is a long-standing cultural system in most MENA countries which aims to control people’s bodies and sexualities. The potential for change in this region is currently limited because, in general, civil society is restricted in its ability to function. Without more progress toward democracy (including imposing limits on police powers, ending censorship and establishing rule of law), it is hard for LGBT advocates to even get a foothold on claiming their rights. 7Legislative remedies in MENA appear particularly limited. While religious law does not rule in most states, it deeply influences secular law and how it is enforced. There have been a few examples of LGBT rights groups winning expanded visibility, but a desperate need for community building and information sharing remains. For many in this region, reforming societal attitudes is the first and most pressing barrier that must be overcome.Eastern Europe and Central Asia: The rise of democracy in Eastern Europe in the early 1990s brought with it increased rights for LGBT people after decades of repression. Over the past few years, however, many of these advances have been reversed. Hate crimes against LGBT people have been occurring more frequently. Conservative political and religious leaders have encouraged such targeting. “They use labeling and marginalization, demonizing, spreading misinformation about LGBT people, saying that homosexuality is a sin, against traditional values,” observed a Latvian activist. While EU member countries have been compelled to adopt anti-discrimination standards, countries outside the EU still resist such changes. Many places within the EU remain without effective enforcement mechanisms. Activists across the region identify cultural change as a priority, including public-education campaigns, and fighting invisibility through gay-pride events and media outreach. For others, legal and policy change remain the top goals. Groups are lobbying the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to more actively take up sexual orientation issues and promote needed protections and reforms.Asia and the Pacific: More than any other, this region defies generalization because of the diverse cultural and political contexts of the many countries it encompasses. In most of South Asia, anti-sodomy laws remain part of penal codes. Such laws lead to arrests, police harassment and exclusion of LGBT people from social and political life. In much of East Asia and parts of the Pacific, same-sex acts are not criminalized. This does not mean, however, that crackdowns on LGBT bars, cultural events and activism are uncommon or that LGBT groups can uniformly obtain legal registration for their work (due to “morals restrictions”). Activist Reports From South Africa and NepalParticipants at the Bellagio meeting heard powerful stories about LGBT rights initiatives from Phumzile Mtetwa, Director, Lesbian and Gay Equality Project, South Africa; and Sunil Pant, Director, Blue Diamond Society, Nepal. In South Africa, the environment facing activists is often harsh, even though the country was the first in the world (1996) to adopt a constitution which included anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation. It is also one of the few countries to recognize same-sex unions. Phumzile Mtetwa explained that the reality for many LGBT citizens is far different than the panacea one might expect. Political and cultural backlash, coupled with a poor economy and complacency within progressive social movements, has created a situation where LGBT “rights on the books” are far different from the “rights on the street.” According to Mtetwa, the reformist agenda did not succeed in altering societal attitudes, as evidenced by the scourge of “curative rapes” perpetrated against lesbian women living in South African townships in recent years. She emphasized the need for the LGBT movement in her country to reach more mainstream allies, including forging links with those working on labor, women’s and economic rights.Sunil Pant described his experiences working in Nepal for almost a decade with sexual and gender minorities, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Pant founded Blue Diamond Society, a network of 20 groups across the country that address HIV/AIDS, human rights and social justice issues, by providing direct services, education and advocacy.Until recently, Nepal was a country that had no legal protections for LGBT people; they frequently experienced indiscriminate arrests and police abuse. Through tireless outreach, community organizing and legal challenges, the situation has improved. Pant was the main petitioner of the 2007 writ against the government of Nepal filed in the Supreme Court that demanded protection and defense of LGBT rights. Months later, the Court ordered the government to issue citizenship ID to all métis or “third genders” that officially recognized them. Further, the government was ordered As in other regions of the world, a rise in religious fundamentalism has created a backlash against LGBT people. The lack of regional human rights structures in Asia has created challenges for networking with mainstream human rights groups. Judicial and political victories don’t always translate to improvements on the ground, illustrating that the gap between legal and social change is often wide. Organizing must take place on the local level for impact to be felt. This is extremely challenging because across Asia and the Pacific, large percentages of the population live in rural areas.Latin America and the Caribbean: LGBT rights advocates in Latin America have experienced many successes in the past 20 years. Anti-sodomy laws have been struck down throughout most of the region, and there are now protections against sexual orientation-based discrimination in countries including Chile, Peru, Mexico and Uruguay. Despite the repeal of such laws, however, there are still a range of provisions that enable police harassment to continue with impunity. Whether at the hands of the state or the public, transgender people are at particular risk — in Guatemala, Honduras and other countries, armed gangs have shot transgender people on the street with few repercussions. Medical and workplace discrimination against LGBT people remains common. On the positive front, strong alliances have formed between LGBT rights and other social justice advocates across Latin America. This has been particularly true of women’s organizations who understand the connections between gender discrimination and sexual orientation. Additionally, effective regional LGBT rights networks exist. Local groups are expanding their capacity to document and seek an end to human rights violations. In the Caribbean, 13 of 15 states still criminalize same-sex acts. Violence against LGBT people is a serious problem across the region, perhaps because of mounting religious fundamentalism and/or pop-culture norms. While attempts have been made to build alliances with other social movements, few significant social changes or legal reforms in support of LGBT rights have been won.8to protect and defend the equal rights of all LGBT people and to see them as “natural persons.” Pant recently became the first openly gay person named to the Constituent Assembly and Parliament. International LGBT Rights Projects and OrganizationsParticipants observed that efforts to advance LGBT equality around the world have expanded rapidly in recent years. Several major human rights organizations have established international LGBT rights projects or have better incorporated LGBT rights into their existing initiatives. New stand-alone LGBT rights organizations have also begun — mostly in the Global North. These organizations and projects have a wide range of philosophical approaches: Some emphasize an identity-based perspective; some place their work in a gender/sexual rights context; and some use a violation-based approach linked to human rights documentation. Strategies used include litigation (such as the effort to repeal sodomy laws); advocacy with the United Nations; and public education to secure improvements in how LGBT people are treated around the world. While the international LGBT rights movement is expanding, participants noted that basic needs among advocates and their organizations remain largely unaddressed. According to research analyzing the 22 major organizations and projects focused on international LGBT rights, global advocacy groups uniformly cited a need for more opportunities to convene on a regular basis with their peers for strategic planning and resource sharing. The report, International LGBT Advocacy Organizations and Programs: An Overview, by the Movement Advancement Project (MAP), documented advocates’ belief that stronger relationships and a more cohesive movement would result from such support. Not surprisingly, organizations also expressed a need for better data and research. Such mapping and documentation efforts would enable organizations to be more rigorous and targeted in pursuing advocacy and service objectives. Unfortunately, resources to develop an evidence base and improved collaborations have been elusive. Finally, organization and program staff 9expressed a need for funders to help them identify and secure new sources of support, either through direct introductions or technical assistance. The report described the nature of international LGBT rights work at a global, regional, national or local level. Global work focuses on advocating with the UN and its member states with special attention on the UN’s Human Rights Council and various treaty bodies. The general goal is to encourage UN and country officials to address LGBT concerns in their programs and to consider LGBT rights as being a central component of human rights issues more broadly. For example, global advocates are pressing for scrutiny of the human rights records of all UN member states in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The UPR gives advocates a chance to submit information to the UN Human Rights Council about human rights violations on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. Regional LGBT rights work is focused on advocacy with smaller governing bodies and mechanisms in a specific geographical area, such as the African Union, the European Union and the Organization of American States. Interventions at this level seek to pressure regions to adopt and incorporate protections for LGBT people, which can also be used to create change within individual states. National and local work often encompasses direct service delivery along with advocacy efforts. This balance is frequently hard to manage because organizations become overextended when they take on too much. Another problem is that groups receiving government funding for service delivery worry they must limit their activism due to fear of financial repercussions.In the report, international LGBT rights advocates identified a number of obstacles that impede their work: n political resistance from national governments and the UN; n cultural challenges related to local customs and religious institutions; n organizational challenges (e.g., sustainability and competition for resources); andn the challenges of working internationally (e.g., diverse and vast demand for services). LGBT groups working in 80 different countries. The number of grants awarded also increased, from 328 to 451 (38 percent more in 2007). While these trends are positive, Zelermyer emphasized that global LGBT rights needs far outweigh available resources and that funding must expand on a greater scale to even approach the demand.Based on survey responses, FLGI’s research found that support for LGBT rights work in the Global South and East comes from only 40 funders — the same number as in 2005. It should be noted, however, that nine funders dropped out and were replaced by nine “new” funders over the course of those two years. The top 10 funders were responsible for 88 percent of total giving. While the 40 grantmakers are from 20 different countries, 96 percent of the total funding comes from North America and Western Europe. Private funders accounted for half of all dollars given. Public funders and other intermediaries provided almost three-quarters of the number of grants given. Zelermyer noted that while FLGI’s research does not account for the totality of grant funding, it captures the vast majority.Thirty-eight percent of all dollars granted went to LGBT groups in the Global North that are working internationally. Fifty-six percent of total giving was split between four countries: South Africa, United States, Sweden and Belgium. Of this cluster, the largest number of grants was made to groups in the U.S. and South Africa. Overall, LGBT groups in Latin America received the most grants. The percentage of funding going to groups in the Global North did not change significantly between 2005 and 2007. Zelermyer pointed out that current funding patterns create challenges for organizations that are seeking to become more sustainable. Only 25 percent of all dollars spent went to general operating support while 65 percent was given for project support. Eighty-nine percent of grants made were for one-year durations. The majority of funding was awarded to support strategies such as litigation, policy reform, capacity building and leadership development. Lesser funding was awarded according to population categories (e.g., to intersex people, youth, and men who have sex with men).International LGBT rights groups believe they would be better able to secure, advance and protect LGBT rights around the world if provided with the following:n increased resources (including funding and program staff); n training tools and other assistance (e.g., help with fundraising and enhanced research support); n improved opportunities for peer connections; and n better local support (pass-through funding was cited as effective for funders and groups on the ground). Participants observed that using a human rights frame for international LGBT rights work creates significant added value. It provides legitimacy, a broader tool kit, and an enhanced ability to connect with allies. While the right to one’s own sexual orientation and gender identity might not be enshrined in international conventions and mechanisms, LGBT rights advocates consistently use human rights language and strategies in their efforts. More important, they see LGBT rights as being inseparable from the broader spectrum of human rights. Current Funding for International LGBT Rights: How/Where It Is Allocated Karen Zelermyer, Executive Director of Funders for Lesbian and Gay Issues, shared FLGI’s newest report about the activities of grantmakers and NGOs working with LGBT communities in the Global South and Global East. A Global Gaze: LGBTI Grantmaking in the Global South and East (2007) is the second mapping effort they have produced on international LGBT rights issues. Zelermyer explained that the first report analyzed 2005 data. The current report encompasses 2007 data. According to Zelermyer, total giving to LGBT communities in the Global South and East has more than doubled in the previous two years. It has gone from $10.5 million in 2005 to $26.2 million in 2007 (including funds that are regranted). These resources reached 10The data collected by FLGI encompassed survey responses from 163 LGBT rights organizations in 61 countries in the Global South and Global East. Latin America accounted for almost half of the responses. Sixty-two percent of survey participants reported their organizations were founded between 2000 and 2007. Almost 70 percent of organizations have five or fewer paid staff members; 35 percent of them have no paid staff. More than half of the groups reported annual budgets of $50,000 or less. Only 49 percent of organizations receive foundation support; 47 percent receive support from individual donors; 19 percent receive government support; and less than five percent receive corporate support. The majority of groups work at the national and local levels, as opposed to focusing on regional or global efforts. Participants agreed that the 2005 and 2007 Global Gaze reports are useful in establishing a snapshot of LGBT grantmaking in the Global South and Global East, as well as gaining an understanding of the organizations and projects working in these regions. It is important to have baseline data about donor giving and the needs of the international LGBT rights movement in order to track changes over time. Such information can be used for fund-leveraging purposes to convince other funders to start giving or to increase their contributions. Obviously, having accurate data about where and how funds are disseminated is important for both the donor and advocacy communities to identify gaps and inefficiencies in funding. Zelermyer cautioned participants about the research limitations. In general, it has been difficult for FLGI to get comprehensive and timely data from funders. There may be a response bias because the survey was distributed in English and Spanish, limiting participation from those who do not speak either language or do not have computer access. Similarly, the report may have missed funders who lack an internal tracking mechanism for LGBT grants. Even when provided, funder data tend not to be user friendly in the aggregate because foundations work according to different accounting systems (calendar year vs. fiscal year), and there is little uniformity in how grant information is captured. 11Participants observed that future mappings would benefit from moving beyond a “snapshot” of the field to becoming more comprehensive, in terms of data collection and clarity of frame for analysis. While there is positive news to be gleaned from the research, the 2007 report illustrates a significant gap for philanthropic resources to even begin to match the needs/demands of LGBT rights advocates in the Global South and Global East. Funding Mechanisms to Support International LGBT Rights Julie Dorf, founder of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission and a consultant for various LGBT rights initiatives, presented the report she authored, Giving Out Globally: A Resource Guide of Funding Mechanisms to Support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights in the Global South and East. The purpose of the report is to educate individuals and/or funding institutions about the various mechanisms available for supporting the international LGBT rights sector. The report is split into two sections: The first details the different funding mechanisms, and the second describes international LGBT grantmaking intermediaries. It is hoped this tool can help channel more funding to LGBT rights work.Dorf explained there are a number of different giving vehicles donors can choose from in channeling their support to international LGBT rights. It is important for donors to determine what level of engagement they want to have with grantees; what type of work they want to fund; and what level of support they require in their grantmaking to select the mechanism that best fits their needs. The report does not provide legal or financial advice, nor does it recommend or endorse any specific service entities. Instead, it exposes donors to a range of giving options and illustrates how even modestly sized grants can have an enormous impact in the field.4. Opening a donor-advised fund that allows for cross-border giving — Many financial institutions, community foundations and nonprofit organizations provide options for donor-advised funds. These funds are constructed so donors are able to receive a tax deduction, while still being fairly flexible and inexpensive to operate. Donor-advised funds differ by size, amount of philanthropic advice and level of service, but almost all include accounting and legal compliances. A recent change in federal policy mandates that international grantmaking from donor-advised funds has the same documentation procedures as private foundations (in terms of expenditure responsibility or equivalency determination). A handful of donor-advised funds allow for direct cross-border grants, and may provide philanthropic advice and support for such initiatives.5. Joining or creating a donor circle, study trip or other collaborative-giving vehicle — Individuals and institutions can support one another through shared giving and learning efforts. Collaborative-funding vehicles (where donors pool their resources to have a bigger and more worthwhile effect) are housed within various human rights and intermediary organizations, or within community foundations. There are also some “diaspora” donors who have joined together to support LGBT rights groups in their countries of origin. There are opportunities to connect with other donors with similar interests through donor-affinity groups (organized around different themes) or donor circles (organized for shared education). Finally, some of the funding intermediaries sponsor study trips which take donors to a specific region or country to learn about the needs and issues of people living there. Obstacles to Increased Funding and Strategies for Mobilizing SupportMarcie Parkhurst, a consultant with FSG Social Impact Advisors, presented a report she co-authored, titled Mobilizing Resources for International LGBT Rights: Challenges and Opportunities. FSG undertook a Web-based survey of about 70 human rights funders, 60 percent of whom don’t currently fund international LGBT rights work. The survey was augmented by 25 in-depth 12The giving options for international LGBT rights fall into the following categories:1. Supporting Northern-based LGBT organizations working in the Global South and Global East — For United States-based donors, it is relatively easy to find organizations with 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status that are working on a global level or in specific countries in the Global South and Global East to advocate for LGBT rights. For the most part, such organizations do not function as grantmakers to local groups but rather work in partnership to support their capacity-building and advocacy efforts.2. Using a funding intermediary to channel support to local groups — There are a number of nonprofit groups and community foundations that function as “philanthropic or funding intermediaries.” They have expertise and knowledge about specific issues, populations and geographies, and provide special grantmaking services, including due diligence and management of all legal complexities involved in giving. Intermediaries are sometimes known as “re-grantors” or as “pass-through agencies.” They may take different forms — some have offices or staff located in the field, some provide significant capacity-building services, some build programs or networks, and some work in partnership with grantees on direct advocacy campaigns. Funding intermediaries are capable of making smaller grants and offer a cost-efficient and holistic set of services to donors and grantees. 3. Making cross-border grants directly or through a private foundation — For those who don’t want to relinquish decision-making authority and have the time/resources to invest, it is possible to establish a private foundation or other planned-giving vehicle. Other options include using an intermediary for single (directed) gifts or giving money to overseas organizations without receiving a tax deduction. There are, however, complex laws and requirements (e.g., USA PATRIOT Act, Executive Order 13224 and the U.S. State Department’s Terrorist Exclusion List) that guide international grantmaking and which all donors must understand and follow.interviews with human rights and LGBT rights funders, advocates and nonprofit professionals. The purpose was to identify obstacles to securing additional institutional funding and develop approaches to overcome them. This was the first study of its kind. Previously, it was only possible to hypothesize why more funders were not engaged in this work or to speculate why funding levels were so low. FSG’s research provided some concrete data regarding these issues.Parkhurst shared that the vast majority of human rights funders recognize LGBT rights as human rights. Ninety-three percent of respondents believe the human rights community has a responsibility to help advance LGBT rights. While this is good news, the reality is that many funders continue to prioritize other issues. The push to increase resources for the international LGBT rights sector is seen as difficult: Even among funders who currently support LGBT rights work in the Global South and Global East, 71 percent report that limited funding in their own organizations is an ongoing challenge. Given the decline of many foundation endowments in the current fiscal environment, the situation is likely to become even worse. Survey respondents suggested that engaging individual donors should be a key strategy for broadening the resource pool.Parkhurst explained the challenges that limit funding for international LGBT rights work. They fall into four categories: Logistical: This category of challenges is seen as the easiest to resolve. The challenges restrict otherwise supportive donors from funding this work. For example, many funders lack access to basic information (e.g. who, what, how) about funding LGBT rights work in the Global South and Global East. Such logistical challenges were cited by 71 percent of survey respondents. In addition, legal restrictions on international grantmaking (both real and perceived) presented challenges to some funders. Conceptual: This category of challenges is related to the level of priority that LGBT rights issues are given. Funders often choose to concentrate their limited resources on other concerns. Why? Some see LGBT rights as an issue that affects one group only and are resistant to funding programs that are perceived as population based rather than cross-cutting or thematic. 13Finally, some funders believe the demand for this work is limited — they don’t see local communities “calling” for increased resources. This doesn’t take into account the relative invisibility of LGBT advocacy work and safety factors in many parts of the world.Strategic: This category of challenges deals with the tradeoffs funders must make in setting their priorities. Focus areas are notoriously difficult to shift. Many funders believe that LGBT rights in the Global South and Global East cannot be addressed until basic human rights have been secured. Others doubt an impact is possible. Funders with short timelines for achieving success are unlikely to get involved — especially in movement-building efforts.Institutional: This category of challenges encompasses obstacles at the staff or board level which limit support for or engagement in LGBT rights work. Attitudes of board members and foundation executives toward international LGBT rights issues are seen as a major influence. While only two respondents cited overt homophobia as a concern, more believed that general “conservatism” and a fear of controversy impeded support. To shift funding approaches and priorities, respondents cited the importance of having vocal champions — especially a strong endorsement from organizational leaders. Parkhurst noted the importance of making tailored arguments to funders about supporting international LGBT rights in a way that fits with their individual values and approaches. LGBT rights advocates have an important role to play in educating and supporting human rights funders, many of whom could integrate LGBT rights work into their existing portfolios without fundamentally shifting their funding strategy. Funding intermediaries also have an important role to play in mitigating the challenges facing funders. For example, by directing funds from grantmakers in the Global North to appropriate grantees in the Global South and Global East, intermediaries reduce the need for Northern-based funders to develop internal expertise about the best ways to fund international LGBT human rights work. Regional intermediaries in the Global South and Global East can offer additional grantmaking services and provide needed capacity-building assistance to NGOs at the local level. n Develop enhanced mechanisms for connecting to “diaspora” funders and helping them become engaged n Help build the capacity of intermediary funders n Support opportunities for LGBT rights activists to come together, share information and create stronger linkages n Promote interest among global corporations, small businesses and civic institutions (e.g., chambers of commerce) as funding partners for local LGBT rights groupsn Track where government funds are spent and hold governments accountable if they ignore LGBT rights issues (including U.S. international aid funds)n Use funding intermediaries to strengthen the capacity of grassroots LGBT rights organizationsn Follow the “money trail” of the religious right and be more strategic in funding efforts, to counter their initiatives that impede LGBT rightsn Prioritize funding of work that is not officially recognized by governments (e.g., support for small grassroots groups)n Provide resources and incentives for broad-based advocacy coalitions that are inclusive of LGBT rights organizations Best Funding PracticesAs a practical step, throughout the meeting, participants exchanged suggestions about “best practices” for funding human rights for LGBT people globally. These included the following:n Establish a holistic point of view for funding LGBT rights among foundation staff and build internal support for shared/collaborative effortsn Create “clout” for LGBT rights issues through developing long-term relationships with a variety of stakeholders inside/outside of foundationsn Establish collaborative-giving mechanisms to support LGBT rights both across and within foundationsn Use regional convenings of human rights advocates as an opportunity to launch calls for proposals targeting LGBT rightsn Ensure that non-LGBT organizations also take responsibility for supporting LGBT rights in their communitiesn Fund general-operating support grants — flexibility is key for nascent organizations that need to build up their infrastructuren Highlight an issue affecting LGBT people that is likely to have resonance with more funders (e.g., stopping violence) and build an educational/fundraising campaign around it14How Donors Can HelpThroughout the meeting, participants also discussed strategic ways for donors to better support LGBT rights advocates and leverage more resources for their needs. These ideas were used to develop the next steps that were agreed upon at the conclusion of the meeting. Suggestions included the following: n Make a requirement that all grantees working on human rights be inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identityn Create an expert volunteer service corps that can be deployed to support the organizational development needs of international LGBT groupsn Build strong relationships with LGBT rights advocates in the field who can help inform funding and capacity-building strategies n Develop more educational site visits for funders to visit leading LGBT rights organizationsn Serve as a resource to other foundation staff on education and capacity-building initiatives (e.g., good entry points for LGBT rights work)n Coach NGO partners on how to forge partnerships with other funders (including making introductions on their behalf)15n Pursue targeted public-marketing campaigns for LGBT rights that take into account different audiences (including geographic differences)n Help make the relationship between LGBT rights and human rights more visible and easy to understand n Strategically encourange human rights organizations and funders to better integrate LGBT rights concerns into their effortsn Advocate that money for MSM and HIV issues (e.g., money from PEPFAR, the Global Fund, the Gates Foundation) encompass a rights-based approachn Get more LGBT rights-oriented funding advocates (internal/external) into spaces where policies and funding decisions are made within foundations (e.g., foundation boards)n Encourage corporate executives who do global giving to consider adding a focus on LGBT rightsn Convene human rights donors and activists to strategize about how to take up LGBT rights effortsn Avoid overstretching LGBT rights organizations that become donor “darlings” with too many demands or excessive project-funding requests16Next StepsThe meeting resulted in a commitment from participants to launch a coordinated effort to increase global philanthropy to support the human rights of LGBT people. It was agreed this initiative will be housed at the Arcus Operating Foundation as a “Project,” but will be supported financially by a number of funders, and overseen by a Coordinating Committee. Participants identified two major areas of coordinated work that must be undertaken to secure an increase in global philanthropy for the human rights of LGBT people: resource-generation strategies and field-building strategies. It was agreed that Working Groups be constituted in these two areas under the direction of the Coordinating Committee. Coordinating Committee and Task ForceA Coordinating Committee will be formed to guide the two Working Groups. The Coordinating Committee may be composed of members of the Working Groups, other participants of the Bellagio meeting who expressed an interest in serving on the Coordinating Committee, and/or individuals who were not at the Bellagio meeting but have knowledge about expanding global philanthropy to support the human rights of LGBT people. The structure and composition of the Coordinating Committee and Working Groups will be determined by a Task Force of individuals from the Bellagio meeting. The Task Force’s role is to: n Determine the basic structure, composition and duties of the Coordinating Committee and Working Groups n Identify the skills and characteristics of the members of the Coordinating Committee and Working Groups (including liaisons from Working Groups and discrete projects)n Identify and solicit candidates for the Coordinating Committee and Working Groupsn Identify and outline the terms governing the relationship between the Coordinating Committee and the Arcus Operating Foundation — to be finalized and approved by the newly constituted Coordinating CommitteeThe Task Force’s work was nearly completed by the end of 2008. Arcus provided coordination and administrative support for these efforts. Arcus Operating Foundation RoleAt the request of the group, the Arcus Operating Foundation agreed to serve as the host organization for this new collaborative “Project” to expand global philanthropy to support the human rights of LGBT people. Participants made a number of suggestions regarding this role: n Position Arcus as the manager of the “Project” housed at the Arcus Operating Foundation rather than the “Project” being part of the Foundation n Have a clear time frame for this “Project” arrangement — both a two-year and a three-year time frame were proposed. The “Project” could then move to another organization or perhaps would no longer be neededn Ensure that funding for the “Project” is raised from multiple donors (including Arcus)n Develop terms of reference for Arcus’s relationship to the “Project” and the Coordinating Committee that clarify duties, responsibilities and authorityCoordinated StrategiesParticipants agreed that some strategies (referred to as Coordinated Strategies) require synchronized efforts by a number of different stakeholders. The two major areas of work needed to secure an increase in global philanthropy for human rights for LGBT people are resource generation and field building. The Coordinating Committee will determine the initial composition of the Working Groups that will take on these efforts and will help determine which Working Groups should oversee different research efforts.17Resource Generation Working Group This area of work will give funders the information and impetus they need to either begin funding human rights for LGBT people or to expand their current support. Tailored strategies need to be developed to target the major funding sectors: n Private foundations n Public foundationsn Corporate funders n Government funders n Individual donors It was agreed the Resource Generation Working Group will develop and carry out strategies aimed at leveraging the different funding sectors. These strategies will focus on the following: 1. Research and Mapping Research and mapping of relevant subjects such as: a. Where funding resources are currently being directed (e.g., across the range of international LGBT rights issues)b. Potential sources of new funding (e.g., government agencies, existing human rights funders) c. Field of organizations working to secure human rights for LGBT people (e.g., which allies are pursuing efforts)2. Donor Prospecting Prospect potential donors and develop an organized strategy for reaching them that leverages relationships and the expertise of people from many areas (e.g., NGOs, human rights leaders, other funders). There was a strong recommendation to use new technologies more effectively, especially for identifying and soliciting individual donors.3. Targeted Communications and Message Framing  Develop new/improved ways of communicating with target audiences to more effectively make the case for supporting human rights for LGBT people in the Global South and Global East. Some specific ideas include: a. Develop and disseminate compelling descriptions of the needs of LGBT people around the globeb. Tell success stories of funders making a difference c. Use case studies to illustrate how positive change is possible d. Make the relationship between LGBT rights and human rights more visible and easy to understand e. Conceptualize LGBT rights issues within a human rights framework (e.g., use human rights tools, such as documentation of rights abuses) f. Use outreach/marketing that is relevant for different countries and cultures g. Explore opportunities to use a sexual-rights framework to illustrate the interconnection of human rights and LGBT rights 4. Developing Unique and Targeted Donor Outreach Strategies Design strategies to engage donors based on their specific interests. These might include the following: a. Focus on MSM and HIV health b. Bring together “diaspora” donors (e.g., people who are from a region or culture that requires support but who are now living elsewhere) c. Develop LGBT rights funds for individual donors and/or form donor circlesd. Create an institutional donor-matching funde. Gather resources around specific LGBT rights issues or campaigns with a targeted fund of $5–$10M (e.g., promoting the Yogyakarta Principles, decriminalization of same-sex adult relationships) f. Host international donor tours, to highlight successes of local and regional LGBT organizations and develop closer relationships between donors and activists g. Explore starting a human rights lobbying 501(c)(4) group that would use political interventions to advance the human rights of LGBT people around the globeh. Host sessions on opportunities to support international LGBT rights at domestic donor conferences, including OutGivingi. Hold biennial meetings of NGOs and funders to ensure strong partnerships18Field-Building Working GroupThe intention of field-building efforts is to bolster the capacity of nongovernmental organizations to effectively partner with and solicit support from donors. A major strategy the Working Group will pursue is to provide intermediary funders with the needed resources and capacity required to serve as an effective link between NGOs and institutional and individual funders. The specific focus areas are as follows:1. Build the Capacity of NGOs  This includes general strengthening of NGOs working on LGBT rights to make them better able to receive donor funds (e.g., becoming registered, building an organizational infrastructure, becoming more sustainable). It also includes capacity building around grant writing, communicating with donors, information technology, strengthening financial systems/reporting and improving evaluation methodology. 2. Shore up Intermediary Funders  Intermediary funders provide a pivotal bridge for institutional and individual donors who do not have the capacity to engage in the complexities of international grantmaking to support local NGOs working on LGBT rights. Intermediaries need resources to increase their organizational, technical-assistance and giving capacity. This might include bolstering local, regional and national intermediaries, or helping new intermediaries to form.  3. Overcome Barriers to Safety Some LGBT rights groups have limited organizational capacity and are unable to connect with donors because they exist in an unsafe environment and cannot function openly. The Field-Building Working Group will be very sensitive to these challenges as they develop their work plan. 4. Promote Stronger Linkages With Other Human rights Advocates LGBT rights groups need support and political cover from other human rights leaders. To ensure that LGBT rights are seen as part of a broader human rights agenda, better linkages must be built. Cross-training efforts and connecting with allies across shared issues (e.g., anti-violence, women’s rights) is critical.Discrete Strategy Activities Other strategies do not require a coordinated effort in order to be successfully implemented. The following discrete activities were identified as useful next steps:n Submit a plenary proposal to the European Foundation Center on expanding global philanthropy for LGBT rights for a Rome-based meeting of their membership n Organize a meeting with the Gill Action Fund’s 501(c)(4) political team to discuss potential global-advocacy strategies n Ensure that commissioned research materials and Bellagio proceedings report are widely circulated. Target upcoming philanthropic and advocacy convenings for outreach and information sharing to leverage new support for LGBT rights Getting InvolvedFor real advances to be made in expanding global philanthropy to support the human rights of LGBTpeople — especially in the Global South and GlobalEast — sustained commitment is required among donors, human rights leaders and LGBT rights advocates. The Bellagio meeting and its outcomes represent an important step toward securing more resources for international LGBT rights work and ensuring that LGBT rights are fully integrated and recognized as being part of human rights.
