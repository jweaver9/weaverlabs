Dayton is Burning A Survey of Drag History and Performance in Southwest and Central Ohio    Honors Thesis Katharine Schreyer Department: Theater, Dance and Performance Technology Advisor: Michelle Hayford, Ph.D. April 2022 Dayton is Burning A Survey of Drag History and Performance in Southwest and  Central Ohio  Honors Thesis Katharine Schreyer Department: Theater, Dance and Performance Technology Advisor: Michelle Hayford, Ph.D. April 2022  Abstract The history of gender performance is long and complex, spanning across different times and places that are each fascinating in their right and worth being studied. This thesis focuses specifically on the drag performances that take place in and around Dayton, Ohio. The research presented here is based on explorations of two distinct time periods 100 years apart from each other, the turn of the 20th century and the modern day. These two distinct times and cultures are each characterized by the performances that occurred, how they were received by audiences, the identities of the performers and the degree of social acceptance they received. This thesis uses primary data collected from archives, field observations, and oral histories to construct an accurate account of the legacies of drag performance in Dayton, cementing the importance of queer life and culture in the history of the city.   Acknowledgements I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Michelle Hayford for her assistance during this process and invaluable knowledge about drag, and Dr. Samuel Dorf for his continued support and affirmation. I would also like to give special thanks to my family and friends for their support, especially my fellow thesis writers, Olivia, Brigid, and Bella, Michaela Miller for answering all my thesis related questions, my sisters Lizzie and Grace, and Dr. Kareem Khubchandani for sending me a copy of their book Queer Nightlife for free and supporting a young queer academic. Most importantly, I want to thank my informants, Vintage Blue, Kiara Chimera, and Brooklyn Steele-Tate for being fabulous performers and generously agreeing to share their stories with me.

The perfect intersection of all of these ideas ended up being the study of historical and contemporary drag performers in the Dayton area, and my interest in and reasons for pursuing this topic have only increased since I started this project. My main motivation at first was to learn about queer history, as I hadn’t been taught any in grade school and high school. LGBTQ+ history is rarely acknowledged or taught outside of college courses focused specifically on this history, and when it is, it often focuses on the hardships and discrimination that queer people have had to face. While acknowledging the tragedies that LGBTQ+ individuals have experienced and still do experience is important and will be explored within this paper, it is also important to make space for queer joy, self-expression, art, and the spaces queer people have created to come together as a community and create beauty and fun for themselves. I wanted to take this opportunity to learn about queer history for myself and share that knowledge with others.  Through my research, I started to notice important parallels between historical and modern styles of gender performance that I didn’t expect to find, which have enriched my understanding of drag history by being able to identify the trends that have changed or only recently emerged as well as continuity within the art form. The biggest takeaway from my historical research, however, is just how much queer history has been lost because of its suppression in the archives and mainstream collective memory, and  2 because the majority of LGBTQ+ people did not have the opportunity to freely and openly speak and write about their experiences. Because of this, the main goal of my thesis is to record drag history as it is happening, giving drag performers the chance to tell their own stories in their own words whenever possible.  The history of gender performance is long and widespread, spanning across time periods and locations, but for the purposes of this paper, I will be focusing my attention on Southwest Ohio (particularly Dayton) from the 1900s to the 1920s and from the 2000s onwards. I have chosen to compare these two time periods 100 years apart from each other, because they represent, respectively, the beginnings of American drag and the most current iteration of it, because performers and queer people in both times face discriminatory laws and conditional social acceptance, and because the differences between gender performances in the two time periods reflect changing ideals and norms within both mainstream and queer society. Most importantly,  as a queer woman myself, I feel it is important to reflect on how queer history has been recorded so that we can improve how record our own history in the present. When historians 100 years from now study the history of drag in the early 21st century, I want them to have first-hand accounts of what was happening from participants in the drag community to define their research.  At the heart of this thesis are the individual stories of drag performers throughout history. Focusing on the individuals who make up these broader histories gives faces and names to the people who have often been overlooked and dehumanized when their histories are recounted. For historical performers, I have used whatever information I can find about them to reconstruct what I believe to be an accurate portrayal of their lives and  3 identities. I use the pronouns, names, and terms used by and about them during their own time periods and refrain from retroactively applying modern terms and judgments to their lives. For modern performers, I had the privilege of being able to ask them how they identify and how they want to be referred to, enabling me to provide longer and more accurate accounts of their performance careers. Though I do take the shared experiences of these performers to provide commentary on larger trends in drag performance and history, it is the uniqueness and value of each individual’s story that makes this work important.   Before we begin, it is important for me to share how I define certain terms that will be frequently used in this paper. I use the word “queer” as an umbrella term to describe all members of the LGBTQ+ community as well as the acronym “LGBTQ+” itself. This word has historically been used as a slur, and continues to be used as such in some places in the present day, but I have decided to use this word because it has been reclaimed by queer people in both personal and academic spaces and because I myself identify as queer. I refer to issues surrounding the gender binary, which I define as the dichotomous system of gender socially accepted in the United States which recognizes male and female, masculinity and femininity, as opposite and separate categories. To refer to performers in the early 20th century, I employ the terms used at the time, male impersonator and female impersonator. A male impersonator is a woman who dresses as and acts in a stereotypically masculine fashion in order to perform as a man, while a female impersonator is a man who performs as a stereotype of femininity through clothing and mannerisms. When discussing 21st-century performers, I use the terms drag queen, drag king, and genderqueer. Drag queen and drag king used to have the same  4 connotations as female impersonator and male impersonator, respectively, but have recently evolved and changed meaning. A drag queen is anyone of any gender who acts, dresses, and performs as their idea of femininity, and a drag king is anyone who performs as their version of masculinity. The term genderqueer refers to drag performers who combine elements of masculinity and femininity in their acts and is also a gender identity for some individuals who fall outside of the categories of male and female.   Literature Review  The research I present in this paper intersects with and is informed by previous literature written about the history of gender performance, gender norms in the United States, and modern trends in drag performance. All three areas of study provided me the knowledge needed to contextualize my own research and create and write about oral histories. The literature written about historical gender performances helped me to understand the historical landscape my 19th and 20th century subjects lived in, allowing me to identify the specific sociocultural norms that shaped gender performance in each time period. Research on gender identity in America provided a deeper understanding of the gender norms currently accepted in our country, and how deviation from these norms is punished. Studies of modern drag performances gave me insight into the academic conversation I was entering and what aspects of queer culture and art I should focus on when conducting my own field research and oral histories. Most importantly, all three areas of study informed my decision to place case studies of individual performers at the heart of my paper.  5 Reading the research conducted by earlier historians on gender performance in the 19th and 20th centuries provided me an understanding of societal norms around masculinity and femininity at the time through their discussions of the people who broke these norms. The first individual performer I want to discuss in depth is Charlotte Cushman, a 19th century actress who gained popularity for her performances in breeches roles. In her 1999 book, When Romeo Was A Woman, theater historian Lisa Merrill analyzes Cushamn’s diaries, personal relationships, public reactions, and posthumous reputation to create a more personal depiction of the actress instead of just a biography. She points out that earlier scholarship about Cushman has largely ignored her private life and intimate relationships with other women, which is why she places emphasis on these elements of Cushman’s life in her book. Merrill also analyzes the ways in which Cushman had to constantly defend herself from criticisms of women in the public eye and women who performed in the theater. Acting was seen as a vulgar and suspect profession in the 1830s when Cushman began her career, almost to the same level as moral degradation as prostitution. Cushman started out as a singer, which was considered a more appropriate profession for women, but transitioned to work as an actress, claiming that being forced to sing soprano parts was damaging her health and that she was naturally meant to play more masculine roles. To defend her decision to become an actress, Cushman asserted that she began acting only because she had to in order to support her family after they were abandoned by her father, the man in her life who was supposed to protect and provide for her and her other female family members. As she gained more fame as an actress and more agency over her career, she began to include her younger sister, Susan Cushman, in her performances, especially during productions of  6 Romeo and Juliet, where Charlotte would play Romeo opposite to Susan’s Juliet. This allowed her to strengthen her public status as a provider for her family, and dispelled rumors of same-sex romance in her performances as Romeo, as there was no sexual desire between the two sisters. Cushman was able to retain her status as an upstanding, moral woman while almost exclusively performing breeches roles because of several newly emerging cultural norms. She publicly announced to audiences that she only wanted to put on productions that taught good moral values and reshape the theater as a respectable place for families and upper-class people of good taste. She also dressed in ways that were not revealing nor acted in an overtly erotic fashion, though she was privileged to live in a time when androgyny and masculinity were idealized, appealing to both male and female audiences who were attracted to those characteristics. Additionally, when she began performing in London, her masculinity and brutish performances were well received, as they fed into British stereotypes of Americans being inherently youthful and tough with unrestrained masculinity, in contrast to their view of their own men as being reserved and in control of their masculinity and their women as modeling the highest version of femininity. Because of this, she became a source of national pride for Americans. However, Cushman still faced negative backlash and reviews by some critics for her unfeminine performances and was unable to publicly express love for women or disclose her intimate relationships with the women she so deeply loved. Although women were assumed to have no sexuality or sexual desires during this time, making it easier for romantic relationships between women to be interpreted as simply close friendships, Cushman still took the steps to burn the letters written between her and her female lovers,  7 suggesting that she was aware that it was not safe for anyone to know that she was attracted to women.  Several decades after Charlotte Cushman’s death, another prominent “male impersonator,” Gladys Bentley, was gaining notoriety in the clubs and speakeasies of the Harlem Renaissance for her unabashed masculinity and open relationships with both black and white women. My knowledge of Bentley was informed primarily by Saidiya Hartman’s creative depiction of the performer’s life in her unconventional 2019 history book Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments. Bentley’s career and degree of social acceptance were much different than Cushman’s because of the increasingly hostile attitudes towards homosexuality and gender non-conformity that had only grown in the time span between their respective careers. She was ostracized by her family for not fitting into the gender roles they expected of her, and moved out to live and provide for herself at the age of sixteen. As a performer, she sang raunchy renditions of popular songs while undeniably flirting with the women in her audiences, and wore men’s tuxedos with top hats and short hair, differentiating her from most other male impersonators at the time because she did not attempt to “pass” as a man or perfectly imitate one. Rather, she incorporated masculinity into her identity as a whole person, upsetting ideas of how men and women, Black people and white people, should dress and behave. As previously mentioned, she had relationships with multiple women, and even was married to one anonymous white woman in a public civil ceremony. Unfortunately, her life of provocative performances and womanizing was disrupted by the criminalization of dressing as the other sex in public and the rise of McCarthyism later in her career. In her 1952 article for Ebony magazine titled “I Am A Woman Again,” she  8 provides a detailed description of her life, starting with her mother’s rejection of her for being born a girl instead of a boy. She recounts her glamorous career as performer, during which she claimed she felt inherently broken and lonely, a condition she was rescued from by finding “a man [she] could love and who could love [her]” and receiving injections of female hormones, a process which allowed her to “become a woman again” and live her life the way a normal female should.1 Bentley states that she had written and published this article in order to “help others who are trapped in [the sex underworld’s] dark recesses” and encourage them to deny the abnormal sexual and gender non-conforming impulses they thought to be inherent to them so that they could become normal. There is no way of knowing how Bentley truly felt about her transition into a socially acceptable version of a woman, but it is impossible to think that she would have been able to continue her career in performance if she continued to be a male impersonator. I chose to focus on the stories of Charlotte Cushman and Gladys Bentley out of all of the other historical figures I read about because of how fascinating their individual lives were due to the different ways in which they interacted with their cultures as male impersonators and women who loved women. Cushman enjoyed a greater degree of social acceptability because she was a white, middle-class woman, performed the type of male impersonation acceptable during her time period, had the support of her family, hid her romantic relationships for the most part, and spent a considerable amount of time and energy crafting a narrative about her work and personal identity that would be considered socially acceptable. In contrast, Bentley was a Black, lower-class woman who refused to                                                      1 Gladys Bentley, “I Am A Woman Again,” Ebony, August 1952.  9 hide her masculinity, created her own style of gender performance that was masculine without hiding the fact that she was a woman, was rejected by her family, and openly had relationships with multiple women. Despite this initial rebellion against gender norms, Bentley eventually did have to conform towards the end of her life to be allowed to continue to exist in public, while Cushman was unbothered for the majority of her life, as long as she was never too explicit about her relationships with women. These two case studies informed how I approached the process of collecting oral histories and writing about living performers.  The second category of literature my research interacts with is that which concerns the changing nature of gender norms, particularly masculinity, in America. Ideas of masculinity and femininity are not, as Gail Bederman puts it, “an ahistorical given. Rather, each is the consequence of ‘historical, ideological’ processes.”2 Each generation of white men shaped masculinity and femininity to fit their own political, social, and economic needs based on the realities of their time period. The noun “masculinity” only came into use in the 1890s, and at that time meant the self-restraint that only men could achieve that allowed them to control their wives, children, employees, and financial success. However, in the decades that followed, economic recessions made it almost impossible for young men to achieve the type of success and masculinity their fathers did, so the masculine ideal had to be reshaped to emphasize consumerism and leisure instead of work. Women’s suffrage and the entrance of immigrants into the political realm, as well as labor and feminist movements, also challenged white men’s claim to power. This conception of male identity was further                                                      2 Gail Bederman, Manliness & Civilization, (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1995), xi.  10 broken down into two terms, “masculinity,” the traits that all men shared, and “manliness,” the positive qualities that only the most “evolutionarily superior” men (white, upper-class men) could achieve. This distinction had to be made when white Americans realized Black men could outperform them in athletics and feats of physical strength; white men were forced to concede that Black men were able to compete with them in terms of physical ability, but they claimed that this was only because Black people had only recently emerged from the jungles of Africa where such “savage” uses of brute force were necessary for survival, allowing white men to say that their manliness was the result of evolving to be able to control and refine their innate strength. White identity was built by contrasting itself with the civilizations created by every other race. In more “primitive” societies, men and women did essentially the same work as men, so white Americans decided this meant that they were more “evolved” than them because men and women in white civilization had been placed into two completely separate spheres of existence. Using this principle of evolution within the human species, white people rationalized that all aspects of their civilization were at the height of human achievement and progress, which only they were able to achieve as the “superior race.” Within this time, homosexuality was beginning to be seen as a disorder, a disease that affected men’s physical strength and prevented them from becoming the manly men they were meant to be.   As the 20th century progressed, masculinity and femininity continued to be defined by the degradation of the “other,” whether that was men asserting dominance over women, white people asserting dominance over Black people, or straight people asserting dominance over gay people. In Susan Faludi’s examination of masculinity in  11 post-WWII America in her book, Stiffed, she notes that marginalized men, specifically gay men and Black men, during this era began to challenge the negative stereotypes against them by reclaiming and transforming them for their own use. Black men reclaimed the imagery of minstrel shows and blackface, as well as perceptions of Black men as violent rapists and gang members, to scare white people, who created the negative stereotypes in the first place. Brandishing guns and appearing violent also made achieving political action easier at first, until that imagery was co-opted and marketed to the white, middle-class population. Gay men during this time reclaimed the stereotype of themselves as sissies through the mediums of camp and drag. Faludi describes the importance of gay men reclaiming the insults against their masculinity by stating that “to take socially sanctified ‘women’s wear’ and flaunt it on a male body was to send up society’s most sternly guarded definitions of masculinity and femininity. The female impersonator challenged the prevailing culture and its gender imagery by making outlandish and oversized fun of it, by blurring visual definitions of sexuality, by pulling the curtain back to reveal that behind the glamor was just a bunch of underwire foundations and greasepaint.”3 At the same time that Black and gay men were reinventing their identities, white and straight men were redefending their own masculinity by adapting the expectations of masculinity they had grown up with to the realities of their culture. Faludi witnessed the interaction of these two newly constructed versions of masculinity in Charleston, South Carolina, at The Citadel, a cadet training facility, and The Treehouse, a nearby gay bar. Many of the local drag queens who                                                      3 Susan Faludi, Stiffed, (New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1999), 500.   12 performed at The Treehouse had dated cadets, who were interested in them for their feminine appearance in drag and not their male selves outside of drag. Both groups were interested in each other not for their birth sex or gender identity necessarily, but for the ways that they respectively performed hypermasculinity and hyperfeminity, in ways that complemented each other. Even though there were some cases of violence from the cadets toward the queens, most queens viewed the cadets with sympathy because they were emotionally trapped by the rigid masculine expectations of the Citadel. They also remarked that the cadets were praised as “whole men'' for doing feminine work such as mending clothes and shining shoes. The Treehouse and the Citadel were both places where men could escape from the gender roles of society- the Treehouse by creating a nurturing environment to perform femininity and the Citadel where they could perform rigid masculinity. However, the activities that happened in these places did not translate to or change the larger society they existed outside of.  When theorizing and writing about gender norms, it is absolutely necessary that scholars acknowledge how the existence of a rigid gender binary actively harms the people who defy it. If too much energy is focused on just theory, academics inevitably end up missing important aspects of the real lives of the gender non-conforming people they write about. Two works, Invisible Lives (2000) by Vivian Namaste, and GenderQueer (2002), an edited volume by Joan Nestle, Clare Howell, and Riki Wilchins, bring the stories and concerns of transgender and genderqueer into academic discussions of gender identity in 21st century America. In Invisible Lives, Namaste addresses troubling trends she had observed in the relatively young field of queer studies, particularly how academics limit the scope of their research by only reading certain texts,  13 studying certain groups, and not informing their research through discussions with transgender people. Speaking about the real-world ramifications of queer studies, Namaste states that “transsexuals and transgendered people must be actively involved in the construction of academic knowledge about our bodies and our lives: anything less advocates a position wherein knowledge is produced, in the first and last instance, for the institution of the university.”4 GenderQueer invites both academic and non-academic queer writers to share accounts about their gender identities and how refusing to conform to their culture’s rigid gender binary affects their relationships and the way that they interact with the world. In this book, 39 different genderqueer people, including the three editors, write about all kinds of experiences with gender, from parenting to sex, going to the club to having professional jobs, and coming out to others and themselves. One story I want to focus on is that of Sylvia Rivera, the transgender rights activist and pioneer in the early gay rights movement in the United States who co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) with Marsha P. Johnson. In her essay, “Queens in Exile, the Forgotten Ones,” Rivera recounts the story of her life, starting with her troubled home life, running away from home at the age of 10, and being taken in by older drag queens who introduced her to New York City’s ballroom scene. In order to survive, Rivera became a sex worker and struggled with addictions to drugs and alcohol, which she recovered from on her own. She discusses her friendships with other drag queens, who relate to each other through their experiences with sex work, poverty, homelessness, and ballroom culture. Rivera began STAR with her friend, Marsha P. Johnson, in order to protect younger transgender people who had been rejected by their                                                      4 Namaste, Viviane, Invisible Lives, (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2000), 267.  14 families and were living on the streets, giving them options for survival that didn’t involve sex work. She discusses her activism in the gay rights movement and her frustration with the movement’s transphobia, which existed in spite of the fact that trans people were the backbone of the movement, doing dangerous and aggressive forms of activism that no one else wanted to do. Rivera also voices her dislike for the radical lesbian feminist groups that excluded butch lesbians, queens, and transwomen, a group that would eventually evolve to become today’s “Trans-Exclusive Radical Feminist (TERF)” movement. One particular incident in which she clashed with mainstream gay rights activists was during the 1973 Gay Pride Day Celebration, where Rivera was prohibited from speaking since the organizers didn’t want any “political” statements to be made during the festivities. When she finally made it on stage she was booed and harassed by the audience as she blasted them for forgetting the work drag queens had done to gain them their rights. Despite her massive contributions to the LGBTQ+ community, Sylvia remained homeless for the majority of her life, and her story picks back up later in the book in Rusty Mae Moore’s essay, “Transy House.” in 1996, Moore and other transgender activists opened the Transy House, which was considered the successor to Rivera and Johnson’s STAR House, and invited Rivera to live there with them when they learned that she was living on the streets. At the end of her own essay, Rivera states that she wants to see the transgender community gain the respect it deserves. She died less than a year later, and the fight for transgender rights continues on to this day. Sylvia’s story brought my explorations of gender norms in America full circle, from theorizing about the past to sitting with and listening to how rigid gender binaries harm the most vulnerable members of our society.  15  The final category of literature I studied to inform my research is recent ethnographic and archival studies of queer communities. Chronologically, the first book in this category is Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold, published in 1993 by Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy and Madeline D. Davis. Their research began in 1978, a time when queer studies was still in its infancy and there were few other publications in the field of LGBTQ+ history. Through oral histories collected from 45 “narrators” (Kennedy and Davis’ name for their informants), they constructed a history of Buffalo, New York’s working-class lesbian community in the 1940s and 1950s, focusing on how community was built at lesbian bars and house parties. Their research was informed by the social conditions lesbians lived in during this time period, including American women’s entrance into the public sphere after World War II, which allowed them to form their own personal and public lives not based on their relationships with men, and race relations between the European, African, and Native American lesbians living together in Buffalo. Though this study is not centered around drag performers or performances, it is still relevant to my research because of its discussions of the butch-femme dynamic in lesbian relationships and detailed descriptions of their methodology for conducting and writing about oral histories. In lesbian relationships, some women will decide to identify either as “butch” and perform masculinity through their appearance and in their relationships, or as “femme,” a more traditionally feminine woman. These relationships are not meant to co-opt or imitate heterosexual relationships but are a way for both butches and femmes to reclaim power from a patriarchial society and create relationship dynamics they like in the context of their own lesbian culture. However, second-wave, trans-exclusionary, lesbian feminists, who emerged as a distinct ideological group in the 1970s, disliked the  16 butch-femme dynamic, as it supposedly enforced antiquated gender roles, brought masculinity into their community, and was inherently sexual. This last point was especially upsetting to this particular faction of feminists, who were trying to distance themselves from the stigma of being “perverse” or “unnatural,” preferring instead to emphasize lesbian relationships based on deep romantic connections without any explicit sexuality. However, this is not a completely accurate reading of butch-femme relationships, as this dynamic must be understood and studied from the perspectives of people involved in the relationships themselves. In order to allow working-class lesbians to be portrayed accurately in their own history, and because there were not enough other primary sources available to construct a complete history, Kennedy and Davis used oral histories as their main source of information for their project. Their methods for getting the best and most accurate information possible included establishing relationships and trust within the community to find interview subjects, creating appropriate boundaries between themselves and the community so as not to cause unintended tensions, allowing narrators to read over drafts of the final book, and finding a diverse mix of people to interview, including butches and femmes, lesbians of all races, and lesbians who were active in the community during different time periods, as well as using psuedonyms for all of the narrators and the people that they mentioned. Throughout their research, the pair readjusted their interviewing process and learned about aspects of lesbian community identity that they weren’t expecting to find. They kept their interview structure open so that their narrators could describe their lives how they saw fit, tracked how lesbian identity and identifying terms changed over time, and found that “oral history as a method involves a personal relationship between the narrator and the  17 researcher; in any successful interview there is a bond of affirmation and understanding that can be very rewarding for both parties.”5 Although my choice of interview subjects and research methods vary from those of Kennedy and Davis, their work was immensely helpful in informing my own process of interview design.  “Archival Drag; or, the Afterlife of Performance,” the fourth chapter in David Román’s book Performance in America, uses drag as an example of how historical performances are archived through modern performances, providing an alternative to using traditional archives to remember past performances and performers by. He starts with the legacy of Sarah Siddons, the 18th century tragedienne, who was extremely famous during her time and the subject of many portraits, some of which were brought out of the archives and presented to modern audiences in a 1999 exhibition. The pictures by themselves were not enough to fully represent Siddons’ performances and essence to people in the 20th century, but Román uses this example to show how her cultural memory has been preserved through the performing arts. Sarah Siddons was painted by Joshua Reynolds, a portrait painter who depicted her as the Tragic Muse, which helped both of them gain more fame in their respective fields. Bette Davis posed as Siddons in a tableau vivant of “Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse,” and referenced her in the 1950 fil All About Eve. These projects increased Davis’ fame as well as Siddons’ because she was brought back into the cultural imagination of the 20th century for modern theatergoers to enjoy. Charles Pierce, a drag queen, became famous by impersonating Davis and other female celebrities, including scenes from All About Eve. Through this process, historical performances are archived through references to them in modern performances by the                                                      5 Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy and Madeline D. Davis, Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold, (New York: Penguin Books, 1993), 21.  18 performers who have studied and embodied past performers. Román applies this same principle to other drag queens as well, such as Richard Move in his artistic interpretation of Martha Graham as the narrator of a modern dance show, and John Kelly’s performances as Joni Mitchell, wherein he dresses like her, plays the same instruments that she does, and rewrites the lyrics of her songs to fit current events, such as changing the words of “Woodstock” to be about Wigstock, and “The Fiddle and the Drum” to be about the War in Iraq. This alternative way of looking at the process of archiving ephemeral events helped me to interpret the live drag performances I saw as history in the making and archiving in action by analyzing the references to pop culture figures and similarities to past styles of female impersonation.  The three words that make up the title of E. Patrick Johnson and Ramón H. Rivera-Servera’s 2016 book Blacktino Queer Performance speak to the identities that intersect and interact with each other in the performances discussed in the book. The authors explore the ways that studies about Black and Latina/o issues and culture have often been excluded from and negatively portrayed in the field of queer studies, which is especially disappointing considering how much work Black and Latina/o queer people have put into the LGBTQ+ community in terms of both creating a unique culture and advancing political causes. Johnson and Rivera use the term “blacktino” to refer to how Black and Latina/o people collaborate with and relate to each other through people who identify with both ethnic labels, their art, and their marginalized positions in society, pointing to Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, with whom they share last names, as a prime example of this collaboration in a queer social space. The interplay of Blacktino and queer identities are explored through the performances and creations of 9 different  19 queer, Black, Latina/o, and Blacktino creatives, as well as through commentary, essays, and interviews that analyze each performance. This in-depth look at the work of individual performers who are all connected by one or more shared identities shows the value of intersectionality in performance studies and what real practitioners of queer art and performance can bring to the metaphorical table of academic discussion.  Queer Nightlife, edited by Kemi Adeyemi, Kareem Khubchandani (who graciously sent me a copy of the book for free), and Ramón H. Rivera-Servera, is among the most recent scholarship published about queer communities and performance. Spanning continents, communities, and disciplines, Queer Nightlife presents 25 essays about the “Before,” “Inside,” “Show,” and “After” of various queer nightlife events. These essays cover everything from ballroom to drag shows, hookups to negotiating with the police, aesthetics to politics, and the ways that gender, racial, class, and immigrant identities (among other categorizations) affect the ways that people interact with their queer surroundings. Though my research as one individual was not able to cover the breadth and depth of topics and issues that this book was, it changed the way that I look at all aspects of drag shows and the people, physical spaces, and cultural implications that surround them, and reminded me of just how important collaboration and friendship with other queer people is when carving out a collective space for ourselves in the world of academia.  The overlapping categories of queer history, gender studies, and performance studies as well as the research methods of archival research, field observations, and ethnographic interviews informed the research I conducted, the aspects of queer identity and culture I looked for while doing my research, and how I framed the primary source  20 material I found. My thesis strives to enter into conversation with all of these works by presenting archival and ethnographic information about drag culture in Dayton specifically.  Methodology   The three main methods of primary data collection for this thesis are archival research, observations of drag shows, and interviews with drag performers. These methods are supported by the existing literature about drag and gender performance and informed by the specific books mentioned in my literature review. The variety of research methods used allowed me to investigate both living and dead performers, and present and past performances to the best of my abilities, helping me to portray both historical and modern drag as accurately as possible. Though the scope of my research was limited by the amount of archival materials I had access to and the time allotted to attend drag shows and conduct interviews, the information presented here provides a cursory overview of drag performance in Dayton, Ohio, and creates a basis for future research about drag performance and culture in the area.  My archival research focused on searching through newspapers published by the Dayton Daily News from 1899 to 1922. I used the online database ProQuest, access to which was provided by the Dayton Metro Library, to search for the terms “female impersonator” and “male impersonator,” which generated 44 and 51 results, respectively. I read each newspaper page that appeared in my search to find the articles that included the terms I searched for and decided if they had any value to my project. Some difficulties emerged through this process; for example, the words “male” or “female”  21 would sometimes appear in a different article than the word “impersonator,” and some of the results for “male impersonator” were actually about female impersonators, with the search tool only recognizing the second syllable of the word. Regardless, this survey of articles written about gender impersonation in the early 20th century provided information on the names of performers, audience impressions, and broader societal opinions of gender impersonation and the theater in general during this time period that I was able to further research and generalize from.  To learn more about the physical spaces, audiences, atmosphere, aesthetics, and social norms that drag shows took place in Dayton and nearby cities, I attended five drag shows at two different venues, The Cabaret in Cincinnati and MJ’s on Jefferson in Dayton. When I attended these shows, I took note of different elements of the shows such as the names of the performers, the performances they did, the music played, costumes worn, the layout of the venue, the interactions between performers and their audiences, and my own reactions to what I saw. Although I was only able to experience a small selection of venues and shows due to time constraints and transportation issues, I was able to witness a variety of performers and performance types which will be discussed in detail later in this paper.   The final area of primary data collection I employed was ethnographic interviews with three different drag performers active in Central and Southwest Ohio. I identified performers I was interested in collaborating with at the shows I attended, contacted them over Instagram, and interviewed them over Zoom. During these interviews, I asked questions such as “how do you identify yourself in terms of race, gender, sexuality, or anything else that is important to your identity?” “What changes have you noticed in the  22 community and art of drag since you began drag?” and “What is your knowledge of and connection to LGBTQ+ history, and how does affect your drag style?” to learn about all aspects of their unique styles of and approaches to drag. Since I was only able to talk with three performers, it is difficult to make generalizations solely based on what they told me about themselves, but they are all fascinating performers in their own right with distinct similarities and differences that can be learned from.  Gender Impersonation in 20th Century Dayton, Ohio The uniquely American style of drag we know today began in the male and female impersonation acts of vaudeville, where gender norms and gender bending were seen as objects of ridicule. Vaudeville was the most popular form of entertainment in American during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as it was performed in “thousands of theaters, in communities large and small, from coast to coast,” pioneering elements of modern entertainment culture such as celebrity culture, continuous employment for performers, and affordability for members of the middle class.6 Female and male impersonation during this period was based on performing a caricature of the opposite binary gender, and its humor came from the rigidity of the gender binary enforced in America at the time. Only men could be female impersonators, and either acted as exaggerated and often insulting caricatures of women or, strived to dress, act, and sound like perfect imitations of “real women.” Male impersonators were women who conveyed their gender transformation through hypermasculine clothing and mannerisms, often imitating working-class men. While these acts were not very kind towards the people doing them or the subjects they                                                      6 David Monod, “Welcome to Vaudeville America,” Vaudeville America, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, https://vaudevilleamerica.org.  23 portrayed, they set the basis for later and more varied forms of gender performance in America. Before discussing the specifics of gender impersonation, it is important to acknowledge that these gender mockeries took place alongside of and in collaboration with blackface minstrel performances. Minstrelsy was the first distinctively American form of popular entertainment, and it was founded by working-class white men gaining profit and fame by exploiting stereotypes and hatred against Black Americans, who were still enslaved when the practice started, and who post emancipation still lived in the most precarious position in American society due to a lack of full civil rights, poor economic prospects, and and other forms of structural and cultural violence. In fact, “Jim Crow '' laws, harsh segregation laws that restricted every aspect of Black Americans public lives, were named so after the famous blackface character of the same name.7 This does not take away from the fact that Black and queer performers found ways to empower themselves and express their identities through these degrading roles,8 but it is essential to remember the ways in which race and gender identities intersect within the performance of vaudeville and how gender impersonations and blackface took place in the same performances, sometimes by the same performers.                                                      7 Matthew D. Morrison, “Race, Blacksound, and the (Re)Making of Musicological Discourse,” Journal of the American Musicological Society 72, no. 3 (2019): 786. https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2019.72.3.781. 8 Morrison, 789.  24 Drag performances in Dayton in the early 20th century were defined by traveling performers, grandiose venues, and conditional social acceptance. A survey of Dayton Daily News newspaper archives from 1898 to 1922 uncovered dozens of stories about male and female impersonators who entertained audiences in the city of Dayton. Almost all of these performances, except for one Halloween costume contest that took place in 1904 in the “Gay City of Greenville,”9 happened within the context of vaudeville. The performers all visited Dayton from out of town as part of traveling vaudeville troupes, frequently stopping at the now-defunct B.F. Keith Theater, a venue built specifically for hosting vaudeville shows. Even though Dayton audiences and critics loved the absurdity of these shows, they still viewed male and female impersonators as inherently odd, and alternative forms of gender expression were not tolerated outside of these specific contexts. Among the female impersonators to visit Dayton were performers such as Julian Eltinge, Martelle, and Creole Fashion Plate. Male impersonators were less common, and less information is available about them, but their ranks include entertainers such as Vesta Tilley and Hetty King. I choose to focus on the stories of these select performers because they exemplify the performance styles and social expectations of the time, they each bring something unique to the story of 20th century American gender performance, and because I want to humanize the art form by highlighting the individuals who shaped it. The goal of these individual analyses is not to speculate on their gender identity and sexuality, but rather to examine their performance styles, the cultural context these gender performances existed in, and the reception they received from their audiences.                                                      9 “Night of Fun and Frolic in Gay City of Greenville,” Dayton Daily News, November 1, 1904.  25 Julian Eltinge was by far the most famous female impersonator to perform in Dayton. He distinguished himself from earlier female impersonators by acting not as a caricature of a woman but as a true “impersonation” of one. At the beginning of his career, he toured under the stage name of “Eltinge'' so that audiences would not know if he was a man or a woman until they actually attended his show. He maintained the illusion of being a woman through the use of makeup, dresses, wigs, and singing in a falsetto voice up until the very end of his act, when he would remove his wig and sing in a lower pitch to show his audience that he was indeed a man, much to their amusement. He soon rose in popularity to the point that he was able to leave vaudeville to perform in more prestigious acts, such as musical comedies on Broadway and silent films in Hollywood. Because Eltinge was a female impersonator, he had to put in considerable effort in his personal life to be as hypermasculine as possible. After one of his final vaudeville performances in Cincinnati, Eltinge won a boxing match against heavyweight champion James J. Corbett, proving to audiences that “just because he makes a specialty of appearing in feminine attire,” he was still “there with the muscle.”10 Eltinge took other measures to protect his masculine image by “getting in fistfights, smoking cigars, and having long ‘engagements’ with women - all of which were captured in staged publicity photographs.”11 These hypermasculine performances were still not enough to gain acceptance from his heteronormative audiences, however. One article about him in the Dayton Daily News acknowledged his efforts at placating the confused feelings of his audiences when they reported that:                                                      10 “Female Impersonator, Star Boxer,” Dayton Daily News, December 29, 1910. 11 Owen Keehnen, “Julian Eltinge - Nominee,” The Legacy Project, n.d, https://legacyprojectchicago.org/person/julian-eltinge.  26 Mr. Julian Eltinge does everything in his power to dispel the unpleasant suggestiveness that goes along with the work of the female impersonator. [...] At the beginning of the piece he is in male attire, and throughout the play it is kept constantly in mind of the audience, no matter how perfect his assumption of feminine appearance in costume, action, and speech, that he is simply a youth masquerading in girl’s clothes. This is quite as it should be, and permits one to enjoy, without unpleasant thoughts, his really quick changes into a better-looking and more attractive girl than a good many real ones seen not only in his company but in other companies on the Broadway stages.”12 Although 20th-century audiences were eager to laugh at and be entertained by female impersonations, they were unwilling to tolerate the bending of gender norms when it made them uncomfortable or forced them to consider the validity of these norms. What does it mean for women and for ideas about femininity and masculinity if, as Dr. Kathleen B. Casey put it, “the prettiest girl on stage is a man? These growing anxieties about “abnormal” gender expressions, which manifested into laws prohibiting public crossdressing in the 1930s, as well as comparisons to newer, younger, and more convincing female impersonators, led to the eventual decline of Julian Eltinge’s career. However, none of these insults to his career and masculinity can change the fact that he was one of the most successful female impersonators of his time,                                                      12 “Eltinge’s New One,” Dayton Daily News, March 22, 1914.  27 remembered as one of the most important originators of the art form to whom all subsequent female impersonators of the time period would be compared.  Julian Eltinge’s revolutionizing of the art of female impersonation caused audiences to crave performances from impersonators who were the most convincing in their portrayal of women. Martelle, the stage name of Thomas Farell, fascinated his audiences, both on stage and off, with his ability to naturally flow between the masculine and feminine parts of his identity. One reporter who visited Martelle in his dressing room before a performance in Dayton noted that “in appearance he is altogether too ‘pretty’ and well rounded to be a man [...] His voice is masculine enough. His mannerisms cannot be described, because he is seldom serious and is such a ‘devil.’”13 From the limited primary sources available about Martelle, it does appear that he was slightly less preoccupied than Eltinge in maintaining a masculine personal identity, seeming content to leave the public guessing as to his true nature both on and off stage. In one article published in Sun-Up: Maine’s Own Newspaper, a male reporter, who does not know Martelle’s true identity, finds “her” attractive from a distance, and the reporter’s coworkers delight in his confusion when Martelle comes over to greet them. Despite how queer or feminine this action may seem to modern readers, the writer reassures us in the following paragraph that “Mr. Martelle is a real he-man. Off stage he has none of the feminine traits which I have found in other female impersonators,”14 showing that all parties involved knew that this kind of prank would be unacceptable outside of the performance space. Additionally, Martelle seemed excited to talk about the ins and outs of female impersonation and his own journey                                                      13 “Martelle One Best Bet in Behman Show at Lyric,” Dayton Daily News, May 12, 1916. 14 Phillip B. Sharpe, “A Case of Dual Personality - But no Jekyll or Hyde,” Sun-Up: Maine’s Own Magazine, May 1925.  28 into the profession with those who interviewed him. He explains to one reporter that “girls, as a rule, act more than men [...] to impersonate a girl one must spend much time in study of the various types. I continually study them, and I learn something new everyday.”15 He defends the seriousness of the art form by informing the reporter that “most people have an idea that to impersonate a woman one has but to put on dresses, a wig, and some facial make-up, and there you are. Try it yourself and you’ll find that it won’t work.”16 Also of great importance in this article is when Martelle mentions that his “costumes cost his managers nearly $15,000 annually,” which, adjusted for inflation, would amount to an expense of $243,185.14 annually in 2022.17 Because of these massive levels of success, in nearly every article about Martelle, he is compared with the prolific Julian Eltinge, whose show “The Fascinating Widow” Martelle acted in as a female impersonator while in his teens.18 Almost all writers come to the consensus that even if Martelle has not “stolen away the hard-earned honors of Julian Eltinge,”19 he is at the very least “a second”20 to him. While still being an evidently impressive and well-loved performer, Martelle never gained quite the same level of fame and long-lasting recognition that Eltinge did. Nonetheless, they are both still fascinating characters to compare and contrast with each other.                                                      15 Sharpe, “A Case of Dual Personality.” 16 Sharpe, “A Case of Dual Personality.” 17 Ian Webster, “$15,000 in 1925 → 2022 | Inflation Calculator.” Official Inflation Data, Alioth Finance, 11 Apr. 2022, https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1925?amount=15000. 18 JD Doyle, “Tom Martell,” Queer Music Heritage, JD Doyle Archives, April 2020, https://www.queermusicheritage.com/drag-SH-martell.html 19 “A Show That Pleases All At The Lyric Theater,” Dayton Daily News, May 8, 1916. 20 Sharpe, “A Case of Dual Personality.”  29 The female impersonator most similar to a modern day drag queen I found in this archival search was the Creole Fashion Plate, also known as George Paduzzi, also known as Karyl Norman. He is one of the only performers I came across who gave himself a true “drag name” as well as a new personal name (Karyl Norman), allegedly for the purpose of appearing more gender neutral.21 He had a “drag mom”- his biological mother who traveled with him across the US as he performed and “select[ed] his gowns, design[ed] a good many of them and [made] some of them herself.”22 Delegating this responsibility to his mother and proclaiming ignorance of feminine attire allowed him to maintain a concept of masculinity in his personal life; even though he acted as a woman on stage, he was still fundamentally a man who was inherently unable to truly comprehend femininity without a woman’s help. Dayton audiences loved the Creole Fashion Plate, proclaiming that he was even more impressive than Eltinge and Martelle because of his ability to deliver quality performances as both a man and a woman with equally good soprano and baritone voices. However, the story of the Creole Fashion Plate is not complete without including the fact that his career started out in minstrelsy as a part of Neil O’Brien’s Minstrels.23 Because there is limited biographical information on the Creole Fashion Plate, it is unknown if he actually                                                      21 Anthony Slide, The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville, (Ann Arbor: University Press of Mississippi, 2012), pp.374-375.

The fact that he began his career in minstrelsy and “moved up the ranks” to becoming an independent vaudeville performer further shows how degrading and low-brow blackface performances were, and how the dehumanizing mockery of Black Americans was seen as a means to improve one’s own prospects. Very few references to male impersonators were found in these particular archives, but mentions of them, however brief, provide crucial insight into the other side of gender impersonation. One male impersonator, the British Miss Hetty King, “The Prince of Vaudeville” was praised for committing to her art by following a British worker around for four hours to learn how to hold a cigar without burning herself.24 She is noted as playing several different characters, including “the Piccadilly dandy,” “the British sailor,” and “the bricklayer from the Limehouse district,” all very distinct categories of men that required mastery of different and incompatible aspects of masculinity to pull off. Comparisons between performers existed within the realm of male impersonation as well, and King was often compared to Vesta Tilley, a fellow British male impersonator whose career (which was managed by her father) was ending around the time that King’s was beginning, and similar to Julian Eltinge, was commended for rising from the work as a male impersonator to the ranks of a dramatic stage actor.25 Despite the fact that male impersonation was less frequently performed and enjoyed, male impersonators still shared remarkable similarities with female impersonators in terms of the social situations they had to navigate in regards                                                      24 “Handles a Pipe Like a Veteran,” Dayton Daily News, October 23, 1921. 25 “The Stage,” Dayton Daily News, December 6, 1902.  31 to acceptable gender performance off stage and the exaggerated gender norms they were expected to portray on stage. Male impersonation is also an important topic in historical American performance studies because of the ways in which it empowered women to break from gender expectations and gain some financial and social independence for themselves, as was the case with Charlotte Cushman. Crucial to the study of these performances is knowledge of the venues in which they took place. Most vaudeville performances in Dayton took place in theaters owned and operated by B. F. Keith, an entrepreneur who succeeded in marketing vaudeville to middle-class audiences and turning it into a “respectable” form of entertainment in terms of content, venues, and audience behavior. Keith’s presence in Dayton began when his company took over a locally owned theater, which was at different points called the Strand Theater and the National Theater, and also may have been called the Colonial Theater, the Lyceum Theater, and the Liberty Theater.26 Not much information is available about this particular venue, and the information that does exist is often contradictory, meaning that no concrete facts about the theater can be stated with total confidence. Regardless, we do know that B.F. acquired the theater in 1914, bringing along with him the physical and moral reconstructions he demanded of his venues. Motivated by his religious morals and capitalist motto to “Get the Coin,” Keith sought to remove vulgarity from vaudeville and rebrand it as suitable entertainment for middle-class families.27 He enforced this new moral code by prohibiting performers from using foul language on stage, only allowing “wholesome” acts to be performed, requiring a dress code for audience members, kicking them out of the                                                      26 Jon Flynn, “RKO Colonial Theater,” Cinema Treasures, July 2006, http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/5794. 27 Christopher B.

Keith: Controversial Vaudeville Entrepreneur,” The American Vaudeville, American Vaudeville & UA Collection, n.d, https://vaudeville.sites.arizona.edu/node/91.  32 theater if they acted too unruly, and designing theaters that resembled palaces. In Dayton, these design principles manifested themselves through “rare, old French furniture,” “wide aisles and seats finished in ruby Italian velvet,” “walls finished with the color of old ivory and lit with crystal and gold chandeliers,” and “a Wurlitzer organ which had 657-pipes.”28 The standards imposed by the man who created a vaudeville monopoly only contributed to the societal and moral expectations placed upon gender impersonators, though there are no specific accounts of how Dayton performers interacted with or felt about Keith. When information about one of these sites is lost, a piece of our city’s history as well as important context to queer history is lost with it. This trend continues to the present day, with gay bars and drag performance spaces being lost in real time. It is my opinion that the physical spaces in which history is made should be preserved whenever possible, and if not, at least the full histories of the places should be recorded. Among the specific performances mentioned in the archives, two stand out in particular. One is the two separate series of lectures (one in 1914 and the other in 1915) that took place at St. Mary’s College (which would later become the University of Dayton) and included female impersonators as entertainers in both series. In 1914, Mr. Beilharz, a vaudeville impersonator who was invited to participate in the series because of how favorably he was received by students when he performed at the school the year prior, “use[d] ‘make-ups’ changing from one character to another in view of his audience, thus avoiding any pause in the program.”29 In the following year, the lecture series included at least one impersonator, a Sidney Landon, who “by the use of wigs and paints [...] gives his                                                      28 Jon Flynn, “RKO Keith’s Theater,” Cinema Treasures, October 2007, http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/3202. 29 “Beilharz Last of St. Mary’s Course,” Dayton Daily News, February 20, 1914.  33 audiences visualization and impersonation in what he terms ‘speaking likenesses’ of men.”30 I believe it would greatly benefit UD to restart this tradition of inviting drag performers to campus to enrich the minds of its students.  Another fascinating discovery from the archives is a Dayton news reporter’s account of attending a vaudeville performance in Washington D.C. in 1922, which was also attended by former president Woodrow Wilson, only two years before his death while he was in a mental and physical decline. Wilson was evidently a huge fan of vaudeville, being thoroughly amused by all of the acts, including “a female impersonator [who] fooled him until he snatched off his wig at the end of the act.”31 Although it may initially seem odd to us today that a former president would be so entranced by female impersonation and the other raunchy acts that comprise vaudeville shows, it makes sense when one considers just how widespread and popular these shows were in America at the time. Judging by the reports given by exasperated entertainment writers at the time, Dayton was evidently a difficult city to successfully market and perform a show in. All kinds of performances, including travel and war films, serious dramas, and, most important for the purposes of this study, comedies of all kinds, were evidently so poorly attended that one Dayton reporter stated that “one wonders at times whether or not it is worthwhile to bring the better attractions to Dayton.”32 Part of this may have to do with the moral standards of the city; one article reported that a particular comedy show had to be “inspected and washed and cleaned at Toledo just for the Dayton engagement,” suggesting                                                      30 “Lyceum Course,” Dayton Daily News, October 11, 1915. 31 Robert Talley, “With Woodrow Wilson At a Vaudeville Show,” Dayton Daily News, September 21, 1922. 32 James Muir, “Interest in Comedy Lags,” Dayton Daily News, February 15, 1920.  34 that Dayton audiences had certain moral expectations for their entertainment that were distinct and perhaps more conservative than other cities. Being a female impersonator came with its own set of challenges that were present no matter where they performed. The Dayton Daily News apparently echoed popular sentiments when they stated that “to the average playgoer, the title of female impersonator immediately suggests and conjures before the eyes an apparition of an insipid creature, who sings in a high falsetto, and pirouettes in abbreviated skirts.”33 This dichotomy of enjoying and laughing at female impersonators while simultaneously being disgusted by them encapsulates how public audiences felt about gender impersonators in this time period. At the same time that vaudeville was thriving, sodomy laws, which criminalized homosexuality to the same extent as incest, adultery, and bestiality, were being enforced and expanded upon. This dissonance still exists to some extent, which will be discussed later in this paper, but this discrimination doesn’t take away from the remarkability of queer people to create spaces for art and expression amongst themselves. Though the landscape of gender impersonation in Dayton 100 years ago was much different from the drag scene we live in today, this period is worth studying because of the insights about societal expectations it provides, the parallels and differences between the characteristics of early and modern styles of gender performance that can be explored, and the inherent value of celebrating queer histories. The drag world of the early 20th century was dominated by competing star performers and established performance circuits, rigid expectations for gender expression, clear distinctions between personal and performance lives, the physical spaces these performances took place in, and the subtle ways in which                                                      33 “Park Theater,” Daily Dayton News, November 30, 1899.  35 gender norms were challenged while remaining in the realm of social acceptability. In the next section of this paper, I will explain how some characteristics of 20th-century drag performance have been completely reversed while others still ring true, and how the time periods and cultures these performances take place in shape these characteristics.  Dayton Drag in the Modern Day Through my fieldwork attending drag shows and talking with drag performers, I have noticed several important differences between modern drag and historical drag as well as newly developing trends within the art form. These characteristics deal with the full range of drag identity and culture from the private to the public and the personal to the political. Alongside the predictable differences between 20th-century gender impersonation and modern drag, there are also surprising similarities connecting queer performances across eras. The first trend I would like to discuss is the changing ideas of what drag can be. Many of the drag performers I talked with and observed combined both traditionally masculine and feminine characteristics into their personal style and considered this personally constructed gender identity to be an important part of their drag. This growing movement in the world of drag contrasts with the established ideas of what drag “should” look like that persist both inside and outside of the drag community. From the 1900s up until relatively recently, drag queens were often assumed to be cisgender gay men, and drag kings were assumed to be cisgender lesbian women, but increasing public knowledge of the complexities of gender identity, the growing number of performers who blend gender norms in their art, and the efforts of academics and activists working to  36 legitimize this form of drag through their work have led to a better understanding and appreciation of genderqueer drag.  The increased popularity of gender-bending drag along with improved social and political rights for LGBTQ+ people has led to more drag performers being able to create public drag personas that help them to discover aspects of their own private gender identities. The performers I interviewed all told me about how drag has helped them to discover and nourish parts of themselves that they had not previously explored such as gender, sexuality, and self-expression. They are also able to express their queerness and live openly as queer individuals in ways that previous generations have not been able to. This is an extreme departure from the lived experiences of 19th and 20th century gender impersonators who were forced to perfectly perform the qualities expected of members of their assigned sex while not performing as the opposite binary gender on stage; who knows what would have changed in these figure’s personal and professional lives if they were not as heavily constrained by the attitudes of their time. Despite the deepening individualization of drag styles, performers still have to strike a balance between putting on routines that are personally meaningful and exciting to them and routines that their audiences want and expect from them. Performers are usually free to bring whatever numbers they want to a venue, but there is no guarantee that the patrons of the venue will like what they present, tip them, or be invited back. Each performer I watched was fairly consistent in the type of songs they chose to lip-sync or sing to and the ways that they embodied those songs, each receiving varying degrees of enthusiasm from the audience. This is not to say that drag performers are totally restricted by popular demand, spaces and fans exist for a variety of genres of  37 performance, but drag is still a job that necessitates working to gain audience approval and support in order to have continued success. Modern performers also have more freedom than vaudeville gender impersonators who were limited to specific types of acts unless they gained a level of fame that would allow them to pursue more advantageous projects the way that celebrities such as Julian Eltinge did. One crucial aspect of drag culture commented on by my informants and evident at the shows I attended is the creation of drag families, friendships, and professional networks. Drag families are formed when a more experienced drag performer agrees to mentor a newer performer, creating a “parent-child” relationship. These families become more complex as drag parents take more and more children under their wings, who then subsequently “adopt” drag children of their own, leading to the creation of distinct “houses,” a term borrowed from ballroom culture that signifies a chosen family of performers who support each other materially and artistically. Performers join communities of other drag artists not only for friendship and affirmation but also for the connections necessary to be hired to perform at shows. The individuals I interviewed all stressed the importance of maintaining good relationships with other performers as vital to a performer’s success. Paired with the building of drag families and support systems is the determination of newer performers to break the cycles of peer pressure from older performers to conform to certain standards of appearance and accept “bitchiness” from other and often more experienced entertainers. This normalization of gatekeeping and negativity is present in almost every creative or professional field, and in the case of female impersonation dates back to the days of mainstream media positioning different female impersonators, such as Eltinge and Martelle, against each other as if there could  38 only be one supreme impersonator, but most drag artists today are more interested in self-expression and community than fame and domination.  Although the cause of gay liberation has done much to improve the cultural acceptance and legal rights of the LGBTQ+ community, constant threats to our rights and safety make continued activism a necessity. All of the performers I spoke with had their own ways of supporting their community, whether that was through charity work, politically-charged performances to mostly heterosexual audiences, or providing resources to queer people in abusive relationships. In a majorly homophobic society, queer people’s personal lives are inherently politicized in a way that straight people’s lives are not, and visibly queer performers have to be cognizant of this reality and choose how to engage with it.  This thesis analyzes only a fraction of drag performers and performances in a specific geographic area, restricting my ability to create accurate generalizations about drag performance, even within the Dayton area itself. However, there are still important experiences shared by performers that I uncovered during this process that are still worth discussing. The following sections detail my experiences attending drag shows and interviewing performers, providing information about their lives and art that corroborate the trends I have identified while showing the fullness of queer life and culture in the area. These investigations do not depict the experiences of all drag performers or performance styles but rather showcase whom I believe to be prolific performers in the Southwest Ohio region that are worthy of academic validation and analysis.    39 Field Observations  My field observations for this thesis consisted of attending four drag shows, two at the Cabaret in Cincinnati, and two at MJ’s on Jefferson in Dayton. Both venues feature performers who live both in the same cities as the venues as well as performers from out of town, including those from as far away as Louisville, Kentucky, and Columbus, Ohio. Because of how often performers travel outside of their own cities to perform (similar to how famous vaudeville performers traveled from city to city in their own time period), I feel comfortable categorizing performances in and around Dayton by performers from across the region under the umbrella term of “Dayton drag.” Additionally, as I will discuss later in this paper, gay bars and spaces where drag is performed are closing down at an alarmingly fast rate, making it necessary for me to widen the geographic range of this survey. These two venues differ in terms of the types of patrons they serve, performers they book, and events and shows they produce, which reflect the area they exist in and the type of audiences they want to attract. Both venues put on excellent shows that are artistic, comedic, raunchy, thought-provoking, and certain to entrance anyone who visits. My style of reporting my findings is partially inspired by the way that the editors of Queer Nightlife approached their work as a sort of “travelogue,” documenting the different places and people they encountered during their research, and partially by the way that 20th century writers described the appearances, performances, and audience reactions to the various gender impersonators they witnessed. My goal is to provide an immersive experience of the performances I saw supplemented by analyses of how they relate to larger ideas about 21st-century drag.  40  The first show I attended was at the Cabaret, located on the second floor of Below Zero Lounge, a gay bar in downtown Cincinnati. The building is small, with a bar, dance floor, and thrones for visitors to take pictures on. The staircase leading up to the Cabaret is narrow and decorated with framed pictures of tits regular cast members as well as mirrors decorated with the same frames. The Cabaret itself features a stage at the front of the room, which is decorated with rainbow lights and flags, another bar, and more thrones. This event was a drag brunch and bingo event that is held twice a month at the venue so that patrons “can get drunk in the middle of the day” as the hostess, Brooklyn Steele-Tate said. As the event was for all ages, the audience members ranged from grandmas to teenagers, including a gay couple who brought their baby with them. Events at the Cabaret are very structured, and this event was no exception. The 2-hour show started with brunch, transitioned into performances from the hostess and the other three performers, who each performed three numbers, took a brief break for a game of bingo (the winning prize was a pair of tickets to the upcoming Kesha concert in Cincinnati), and concluded with more performances. The flow between performances was guided by Brooklyn Steele-Tate, especially through her banter with Ava Aurora Fox, one of the other drag queens performing that afternoon. Most of their discussions revolved around Eileen, the baby, including how she would become Ava’s drag daughter once she was potty trained, her stealing and chewing on the queens’ jewelry, and her interactions with the queens during performances, which included her dads putting dollar bills in her hands to “give” to queens and getting picked up and carried around by the queens as they performed. In addition to hosting, Brooklyn lip-synced in between sets to songs such as “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” by Cyndi Lauper and “Fuck Me” by Wendy Ho. Ava lip-synced and danced to popular female artists such as Britney  41 Spears, Katy Perry, and Britney Spears and, like all of the other non-hosting queens changed her costumes and wigs between every number. The third performer, Quasi, performed her first number in a sparkly dress with a train and a Black power fist, and wore similarly impressive outfits in her following numbers, including a black and white floor-length sequin gown, a giant necklace with her name on it, sparkly glasses, huge earrings, and afro space buns, cementing her place as the most impressively fashionable performer at the show. Ushtel Valentine, the fourth performer gave high energy performances to songs like “Drunk in Love'' by Beyoncé and “Starships” by Nicki Minaj, accented by high kicks, jumping splits, cartwheels, and general feats of flexibility that impressed the audience. The patrons were enthusiastic about all of the performers and tipped them generously, which won them personal interactions with the queens. After the show, audience members were able to talk and take pictures with the queens. The Cabaret differentiates itself from other venues because they require prior reservations to attend their shows, which come with a high ticket price not including the costs of drinks and tipping, meaning that their shows cater to patrons with disposable incomes and the ability to take time off during the day to watch to go to a drag show. The individual numbers also consisted mostly of modern pop music with limited amounts of sexually suggestive  42 content, possibly because this show in particular was for all ages. The presence of younger adults, families and a baby illustrate how drag is becoming more accepted as a form of mainstream entertainment that is not seen as inherently perverse or sexual. The drag brunch was entertaining, and the cast members were wonderful to interact with, and the types of drag presented aligned well with current pop culture.  The second show I attended at the Cabaret featured the performer Utica Queen, a contestant on the 13th season of RuPaul’s Drag Race, and three local queens. The age of the patrons of this performance skewed younger than the first show I attended at this venue, aligning with the age group that forms the majority of the fanbase of Drag Race. The audience was equally supportive of both the local queens and the out-of-town celebrity queen, who each had unique performance styles comprised of lip-syncing, spoken word, internet memes, and audience interactions. The hostess, Kora Sline, began the show with a mix of “9 to 5” by Dolly Parton and “The Typewriter” by Leroy Anderson, and pretended to type on people's tips. Her second number started with an audio clip of the rant from “Kidz Bop Karen” which then transitioned into the Kidz Bop version of Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts,” the choreography of which included dabbing and doing the whip and nae nae, dance moves often associated with younger children and considered by some to be “cringe.” The second performer was P.H. Dee, who lip-synced to “ET” by Katy Perry while wearing an outfit that glowed under the blacklights of the room, and “A Little Bit Alexis” from Schitt’s Creek interspersed with Alexis’ lines from the show. She also interacted with several patrons in a very personal manner, presumably because she knew them outside of drag or because they were regulars to the Cabaret. The final local queen, Jessica Marie Jones, performed a mix of “Whole Lotta Woman” by Kelly Clarkson, “Tempo” by Lizzo, and the  43 audio of a woman ranting about a McDonald’s cashier calling her fat and not offering her an extra McRib. She was extremely funny in all of her performances, pretending to play the flute on one of her tips during “Tempo” and twerking on my friend’s sister while making direct eye contact with me, for which I tipped her generously. The final performer was Utica, whose entrance was preceded by the producer for Hard Candy events, which organizes shows in Cincinnati, Kansas City, MO, Richmond, VA, Huntington WV, and Lexington KY that feature celebrity drag queens from RuPaul’s Drag Race and The Boulet Brothers’ Dragula. He explained that a different Drag Race performer, Jan Sport, was originally supposed to perform that night but had to reschedule, but he still wanted to put on a show so that local queens could perform and make money that night. Utica then lip-synced to covers of “Lean on Me” and “Bridge Over Troubled Waters” in the somewhat serious, somewhat kooky manner that she is known for. In all of her performances, she wore elaborate, handmade outfits, another aspect of her drag persona that she is well known for, most notably a floor-length red gown that hung from her earring and limited her movement as she lip-synced to “I Love My Body” by Jessie J, requiring her to interpret the song through facial expressions and gestures. After the show, there was a meet-and-greet which my sister and I attended, where Utica greeted us both individually and spent a decent amount of time talking with us and the other patrons who came to take pictures with her, showing that she was as personable in real life as she was on the show. Overall, the numbers performed at this show were more diverse in relation to each other and in terms of the different musical and comical elements combined into a cohesive storyline. The way that the audience was equally enthusiastic about both the local queens and Utica disproved my earlier assumption that crowds would be more receptive to drag queens with “celebrity”  44 status, as patrons of the Cabret are loyal to its cast members and eager to experience multiple aspects of drag culture and performance.  The first show I attended at MJ’s on Jefferson was hosted by Holly Berry, a bearded queen, and featured 6 other bearded queens. MJ’s on Jefferson is similar to the Cabaret in that they are both small, downtown venues containing both a bar area and a stage, except that MJ’s has a much larger stage with more elaborate lighting and sound setups which is on the same floor as the bar. Reservations were not necessary to be able to attend the shows but buying a ticket ahead of time guaranteed me a place to sit at a table close to the stage. These tickets were much less expensive than those at the Cabaret, and the structure of the show and the movement of people throughout the club were less regulated. The show started with Holly Berry performing “Welcome to Burlesque” by Cher. As a bearded queen, her presentation was much different from the more conventionally feminine drag queens I had seen before. She wore a hat with no wig, colorful eye makeup, a full beard, a corset with black nipple pasties, full chest hair, bear paw tattoos on her chest, and a skirt, combining both extreme masculinity and femininity into one cohesive presentation. After her number, Holly introduced herself and the rest of the show, expressing gratitude to the audience for “making an old show bear feel so welcome” and for being able to perform in person again since the loosening of Covid restrictions. She also informed us that both her biological mother (as opposed  45 to her drag mother) and the biological mother of Amanda Berry, her drag sister and real-life husband were in the audience that night. The first performer after Holly was Kiara Chimera, a fellow bearded queen who paired her facial hair with long hair and colorful makeup and leotards. Each performer at this show did three numbers, and one of Kiara’s was a mix of songs from Lady Gaga’s album Chromatica, which she danced, vogued, and did tricks to while lip-syncing, entering the audience much more than the other performers, which engaged them further and encouraged them to tip her more. The next performer in the line-up was John Jason, a dancer who didn’t wear wigs or excessive makeup to give the illusion of being the opposite binary gender but instead dressed in elaborate costumes including an orange bodysuit with a large and elaborate feather headpiece, a black robe that was taken off to reveal a sparkly, fringed bodysuit, and a glittery blue suit with a jeweled headpiece. His performances consisted of lip-syncing while performing intense dance routines, presenting costuming and choreography similar to the outfits and performances characteristic of ballroom culture. The fourth performer was Amanda Berry, whose makeup, outfits, and song choices were similar to that of her husband, both of whom frequently interacted with their mothers and each other throughout the night. Her numbers included “Heartbreaker” by Pat Benatar and a medley of Schoolhouse Rock Songs edited to include curse words. After Amanda was Destiny Genesis, the drag daughter of Holly Berry who also shared her style of drag and lip-synced to “Champagne Taste” by Eartha Kitt, “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” by Whitney Houston, and “What’s Up” by 4 Non Blondes. The next performer was Lexi Pro, a bald bearded queen whose performances were accentuated by reveals which were concealed under long, hooded robes. Her first performance was a lip-sync to a medley of Arianna Grande songs, the more emotionally  46 and musically climactic moments of which involved Lexi ripping off her cape and later, her wig. Her second lip sync was to a cover of “Rhiannon” performed by Miley Cyrus which was equally intense and punctuated by a similar reveal. The final performer of the night was Joey Gallagher, who distinguished herself from the other queens by singing live. Fluidly transitioning between bits of different songs, she created her medleys as she moved through the audience and sang to individual attendees, one of whom was moved to tears. Joey had some difficulties with her handheld mic, having to readjust its position with her changes in dynamics and distance from the speakers, but still gained the appreciation (and tips) of her audience. One of the final performances of the night was by Holly Berry, who before lip-syncing to “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now” by Celine Dion explained that she would be donating all of her tip money for the night to organizations that help brain cancer patients since she had brain cancer as a child and was told that she “would die before 16, and [she’s] 37 now.” Just from that number she made over $200 in tips and promised that she would post a receipt for her donation on her social media accounts. Another important audience interaction that night was when Holly asked anyone who was celebrating a “birthday, divorce, marriage, or first time at a drag show” to come up on stage and take a shot with her. She took shots with 3 girls who were celebrating birthdays as well as a bachelorette attending the show with her bridal party. Holly asked the bachelorette to show her her engagement ring; Holly commented that she must have a gag reflex and showed off her giant costume ring as an example of what you can get if you don’t have a gag reflex. The night ended with all of the cast members coming together to lip-sync to “Seasons of Love” from the RENT soundtrack and thanking the audience for coming. The show lasted 4 hours in total due to the number of performers and breaks to interact with  47 the audience and other cast members. There was a more relaxed boundary between performers and audience members at this venue compared to the Cabaret, with patrons and performers alike able to move about the space freely and talk directly to each other. Unfortunately for me and the friend I attended the show with, we are hard of hearing, and the loud atmosphere that was only made worse by the number of people moving about and conversing prevented us from understanding the dialogue between the performers, the lyrics to the music being played, and people who were speaking directly to us. This included Holly Berry, who commented that we looked scared, which was due to us not being able to understand what we were hearing. Loudness and confusion are inescapable aspects of any type of nightlife, but it would be worthwhile for venues to consider how they might make their spaces more accessible to people with hearing and sensory difficulties. However, the more casual nature of the evening made it possible for personal interactions to take place between different performers and their patrons, revealing just how close the cast members that night were to each other, especially Holly Berry, who booked all of them. The relationships and deeply personal styles of drag on display that night made the show memorable.   The final show I attended was a “King and Queen show” hosted at MJ’s on Jefferson. Eight drag performers each performed three numbers, making it the longest drag show I attended for my research. The show was co-hosted by Austen Lee, a drag king, and Olivia Jane, a “bio queen,” a cisgender woman who performs as a drag queen. this was the first show I’ve been to that had drag kings, and all of the performers were either drag kings or “bio queens.”. This show was also unique in that I could tell that all of the performers had extremely close relationships with each other; they would tip the other performers in  48 between their own numbers, be very physically affectionate with each other, and tell stories about how they’ve performed together for many years and helped each other in their drag journeys. Each performer had their own distinct style of dress and choice of lip-syncing numbers. Austen Lee, who was hosting a drag show for the first time, performed to songs by the Jonas Brothers, Ed Sheeran, and Luke Bryan. Olivia Jane, who introduced herself as a long-time friend of Austen, performed to high energy mixes of songs by Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion, and the Spice Girls, wearing thick padding and heavy makeup, featuring wig reveals and costume changes. Also performing in the show were Ty Erup and Puck Erup, two drag kings and transgender men whom Olivia identified as her husband and boyfriend, respectively. Ty performed to alternative music by artists such as Panic! At the Disco while wearing a black trench coat and top hat, and Twenty One Pilots while wearing ripped jeans, a snapback, and a holographic tank top that showed off the scars from his top surgery, a gender affirming surgery that some transmasculine people undergo to remove breast tissue and give them a flat chest. In contrast, Puck performed to songs by more mainstream male artists like Bruno Mars, Jason Derulo, and Maroon 5, and also wore loose or see-through shirts that revealed his top surgery scars. This costuming choice was a constant across most of the transmasculine performers of the night, including the third transgender man to perform, Dorian Lee, whose outfits also exposed his insulin pump. The next performer of the night was Sho Sho Zahav, who wore large, colorful, stereotypical drag makeup, provocative outfits without shoes, and styled her own hair instead of wearing wigs. She sang live to “Black Velvet” by Alannah Myles and “She Used to Be Mine” from Waitress, and for her third number lip-synced while dancing sensually. The final two performers of the night, Sky Black and Vintage Blue, were both drag kings who wore dress  49 pants and shirts and were openly flirtatious with the female members of the audience. Austen and Olivia both praised Sky Black as a mentor who helped both of them when they first started performing as drag kings, affectionately referring to him as an “old man.” Vintage Blue, who will be discussed in more detail later, paired suspenders and dress clothes with colorful makeup that artfully accentuated the masculine features of his face. Despite the sheer number of performers giving varied and energetic performances that night, the audience was significantly smaller than that of previous shows at both the Cabaret and MJ’s on Jefferson. It is unknown whether this was because of the date or time of the performance or a lack of interest in the show, but I did notice that performers with more unique presentation styles that didn’t fit within the boundaries of either exaggerated masculinity or femininity did not receive as much enthusiasm or tips from the audience. Still, the relationships evident between all of the performers who were each given the opportunity to present their own personally meaningful styles of drag were fun to witness  The diversity of drag present in Southwest Ohio can be seen across just two different venues and four different shows. While there was some overlap in personal styles, each performer had their own distinctive drag characters and performances composed of their gender presentation, costuming, musical and performance choices, and interactions with their audiences. The Cabaret and MJ’s on Jefferson each cater to a specific clientele, with shows at the former being more expensive, more structured both in terms of how patrons are allowed to move around the venue (and therefore more Covid safe) and in the mostly pre-planned and Show advertisement, courtesy of MJ’s on Jefferson  50 professionally executed show formats, and the latter being more affordable and casual in terms of audience movement, admittance, and the boundaries between performers and audience members. While the Cabaret features a more regular cast with visiting guest performers and MJ’s casts change frequently from week to week, both venues rely on the connections formed between entertainers to bring in different talent and keep their shows fully booked. Both venues specialize in running different types of events, with the Cabaret providing a mix of family friendly as well as more mature shows featuring different elements at each show, such as comedians, bingo, celebrity drag queens, and watch parties of Drag Race, while at MJ’s there are different performers every week representing a range of gender presentations and performance styles. If I were to claim that this analysis was part travelogue, I would be remiss not to encourage my readers to visit these two venues for themselves.  As an unfortunate addendum to this section, I must report that as of April 11, 2022, the Below Zero Lounge and the Cabaret are no longer open. This closure is just one of many in recent years, including Masque, a prominent gay bar in Dayton that shut its doors in 2020. Though these bars likely never reopen, we are still able to financially support the gay bars that are still operating as well as the performers who make their livelihoods there to help prevent these venues from closing as well.  Brooklyn Steele-Tate  Brooklyn Steele-Tate is a 50-year-old, white, gay, cisgender man who uses he/him pronouns. As a veteran of the drag community who has worked as a drag queen for the past 25 years, he has witnessed several changes in the art of drag, the queer community, and the societal acceptance of LGBTQ+ people. Though he is now starting  51 the process of retiring from drag, his long career has included hosting shows at the Cabaret, doing fundraising, advocacy, and charity work, and being a leader in Cincinnati’s gay community. Brooklyn has a unique perspective on the current cultural and legal challenges queer people, and especially children, are facing as someone who has experienced discrimination and has actively fought against it, and his work reminds us all of the importance of supporting your community.  Brooklyn’s first time performing in drag took place almost 25 years ago in Lima, Ohio, on a dare from some of her other gay friends. As she recounts:  “the first time I ever did it was because a friend of mine- we were going to go see a show and his best friend was in the show, and he said ‘we should get all dressed up and go out’ and so we took the day off of work and we drank all day and ate, and then we just took like, six hours to get ready, because there are three of us, and none of us- only one of us had done it before, and the two of us didn't so he was helping us get ready and all that kind of stuff. And then we went out to the bar that night for the show and the show was canceled, and so they were like, ‘you guys should go on, you guys should do a number!’ and I’m like, ‘I’m not doing a number,’ and the whole time I’m like, ‘I’m not doing it, I'm not doing it, I’m nervous,’ and that kind of stuff.  I was preparing, I was making sure my makeup looked fine, my hair was good, that kind of stuff, and then the music started and we walked out on stage, and it was like, it.”34 After this, he became a show director in Lima but moved to Cincinnati after two years to become a part of The Imperial Sovereign Queen City Court of the Buckeye Empire, an                                                      34 Brooklyn Steele-Tate, interview by author, March 28, 2022.  52 international group of drag performers with chapters in Canada, the United States, and Mexico that organizes fundraising events. Any charity with a 501(c)3 status can ask the Court to supply their fundraising event with drag performers who will sing, juggle, perform with flamethrowers, or do “anything to raise money, legally.” The Queen City Court has raised over $1.4 million since its founding in 1990 for a variety of charities including cat adoption agencies, AIDS organizations, centers for LGBTQ+ youth, and resource centers for victims of human trafficking. On top of all of his fundraising and hosting work, Brooklyn also works a 9-to-5 day job in sales, two areas of his life that he doesn’t let contradict or impede each other.  Since the time Brooklyn started doing drag, he has seen increased diversity in the personal aesthetic choices of drag performers and the types of audiences who attend drag shows. When he began his career as a drag queen, queens were expected to wear hip padding, breastplates, and other accessories to create a more “womanly” shape with their bodies, which is something he continues to do. Nowadays, however, Brooklyn reports seeing more queens who don’t shave or wear padding or breastplates and has seen more drag kings enter the drag scene as well as transgender women who perform as drag queens. He also told me that he still prefers to perform to artists such as Whitney Houston, Kelly Clarkson, Adele, Alanis Morissette as opposed to the top 40 hits that younger queens like to lip-sync to.  With increased acceptance of drag as a form of entertainment, the demographics of drag show attendees have shifted to include more straight people, especially bachelorette parties and straight girls who feel comfortable in gay bars because they know they won’t get hit on. Due to the popularity of shows such as RuPaul’s Drag Race  53 and Orange Is the New Black, drag show audiences not only see drag performers and transgender people in a more positive light but also as celebrities to an extent. Describing this phenomenon, Brooklyn said, “they see it on television and they want to see it in person and they expect the same thing, like they expect when they come to a show they’re going to see RuPaul’s Drag Race and the spotlight and the glamour of the television, and it’s not really the same, but it’s very much like they’re meeting celebrities [...] so even for a local girl who is out all the time and doing this kind of stuff, they get that celebrity status.” As the host of the Cabaret for the past 11 years, Brooklyn is also appreciative of the audiences that support him there as well as the other queens he performs with. He has been a part of the cast of the Cabaret since it was founded, and he talked about how the venue was intentionally built to be an intimate, sit-down area where patrons and performers could interact. He discussed how he engages audiences, especially bachelorette parties because “the more you involve them, the less they want to get involved,” preemptively preventing drunk patrons from disrupting the show. Brooklyn works with a rotating cast of performers at the Cabaret and highlighted to me how each of them brings something different to the table. These differences exist in their costume choices, ranging from floor-length ballgowns for some queens and Chewbacca costumes for others, musical choices from pop-punk to soulful ballads, dance abilities, and other talents, as well as any unique aspects of drag that the performers want to show off. Brooklyn maintains strong friendships with fellow drag performers, and as a host, show director, and fundraising coordinator, he feels it is important to have good relationships with other local performers who he can call upon and give opportunities to when charities and other event planners want to involve drag artists in their work.  54 Having spent two and a half decades in the public eye as a drag queen, Brooklyn has formed his own approach to educating people about LGBTQ+ issues and advocating for marginalized social groups. When people from outside of the community with limited knowledge of drag make assumptions about why people do drag (usually assuming that all drag queens do drag because they want to be women), he is able to teach them about how drag performance and gender identity act independently of each other by explaining his own experience as a cisgender man as well as the experiences of some of his other drag queen friends who are transgender women and each have different relationships between their drag and their gender. At the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, Brooklyn decided that his place as a white man was not to publicly protest but to support the people involved in the movement by doing things such as donating money for bail funds and other resources that protestors needed. From his years of helping groups fundraise, he knows how easy it is for people outside of political movements to take over work that the already marginalized people affected by injustice have started, so he purposefully positions himself in a supporting role so that there’s no chance of him contributing to that problem. When asked about the current attacks on gay and transgender rights happening in our country, Brooklyn reemphasized the need to educate people who grew up in and live in more conservative environments who may have never met and therefore cannot understand, any queer people. He also cited control issues as a factor in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, especially when pertaining to the rights of queer children, who he referred to as “our kids.” Expressing his thoughts on how to protect our kids, he said that “our goal is to make sure our kids feel safe, our kids feel comfortable, that when they're out in everyday life that they can just walk the streets and be who they  55 are, you know? I always have a two-fold reaction when I see a kid being themselves [...] so if I see a kid who's very obviously queer, dressed how he wants to dress or how she wants to dress, I'm very happy for them at first, and then I become very scared for them second.” Brooklyn, along with many other politically active queer people, is painfully aware of the ongoing struggle we face but is still optimistic and willing to continue fighting for our rights.  Kiara Chimera Kiara Chimera is a genderqueer, bearded drag queen living and working in Cincinnati, Ohio, who uses she/her pronouns in drag and he/they pronouns out of drag. Her drag style is defined by high fashion and combining masculinity and femininity to create a drag character that has become a part of her identity outside of drag. She has a large drag family that includes parents, children, and her coworkers at Good Judy’s and MixWell’s the two gay bars she hosts shows in Northside, the unofficial “gayborhood” of Cincinnati. As a regular performer at Good Judy’s which was recently voted the “Best Overall Bar,” “Best Gay Bar,” and “Best New Bar” in Cincinnati,35 who has been invited to perform at several pride events, Kiara has had the opportunity to incorporate activist themes into her numbers to communicate messages about acceptance and inclusion of LGBTQ+ people to audiences that would not regularly be exposed to such politics in their entertainment. Kiara is a mold-breaking artist whose unapologetically genderqueer drag represents the evolution of drag in the modern day.                                                      35 CityBeat Staff, “Music & Nightlife,” Cincinnati CityBeat (Cincinnati CityBeat, April 20, 2022), https://www.citybeat.com/best-of/2022/music-and-nightlife.  56 Kiara first began performing as a drag queen in September of 2017 when she moved to Dayton for college and was introduced to it by a friend who worked as a burlesque performer at the time. She first started performing at Masque, a now-defunct gay bar in Dayton, where the type of drag other drag queens there expected new queens to follow was very strict and favored more traditionally feminine aesthetics. Despite this, Kiara decided to perform as a bearded queen, keeping her natural facial hair and combining it with feminine outfits, makeup, and hair. Her choice to be a bearded queen was influenced by her belief that body hair shouldn’t be viewed as inherently masculine and “to confuse men.”36 During the Covid lockdown, she realized how interconnected her drag character, Kiara is with her personal identity, Tristan. In her own words, she told me that: “I realized over that length of time that Kiara and Tristan are not the same person, but they are also the same person, just because there's a lot of Kiara that comes out in Tristan and there's a lot of Tristan that comes out in Kiara, and Kiara is so close to who Tristan is that I don't think that she is just some character I made up. I think she's an extension of the femininity that I never got to show off when I was growing up and the kinetics of the love of human bodies that I never got to, you know, experience growing up, and she is like, a goddess of passion as I like to say. She is very celebratory of love and lust and performance and you know, just being sickening and beautiful. I realized over the span of probably about six months to a year that me and Kiara are seen as two different people living in the same body.”                                                      36 Kiara Chimera, interview by author, March 18, 2022.  57 Along with this realization, she decided to focus her drag more on what she wanted to do rather than what other people expected of her. Out of the three numbers she performs in a night, she will usually do one that she knows everyone will like, but for her other two performances, she’ll do what she likes in order to broaden people’s eyes to what music can and should be. Another important aspect of Kiara’s drag is fashion, inspired by designers like Gucci, Mugler, and Versace. She buys affordable pieces from the internet, thrift stores, and other drag queens, making sure to include outfits with a variety of colors that will look good on Instagram and pair well with the music she performs to.  Over her five years working as a drag queen, Kiara has built a sizable drag family. She considers her now-retired friend who introduced her to drag as her original drag mother, but has been “adopted” by Katrina Reelfish, a queen who has down drag for 8 years, lives with her, works with her at Good Judy’s. She also has taken three drag children under her wing, believing in the importance of encouraging newer drag performers who are looked down upon by older drag performers. Her first child is Jeanna Steel, who she met at Masque. Her next child, Crylee Chimera’s original drag name was Riley J but was called “Crylee” by her original drag mother when she bullied her. Kiara’s third child is Honey Stix Chimera, who she met during an open stage night at MixWell’s and who just recently took her last name. In addition to her drag family, Kiara also maintains relationships with a dedicated group of patrons at Good Judy’s called their “good Judys” who she interacts with during shows and receives feedback on her performances from. As a show director, she also is friendly to other drag performers with who she regularly interacts, as she needs to be able to book people for her shows and get  58 along with anyone she might have to work with, saying that she “tries not to be as bitchy as some other girls can be.” As a genderqueer person living in a mostly Republican state, Kiara is aware of the discrimination queer people have faced in the past and continue to face today. Because of this, she’ll occasionally perform numbers dedicated to LGBTQ+ history and issues, especially during Pride Month, saying that “I try to be very politically forward when it comes to queerness and just us in general, just because I know a lot of non-LGBTQ+ people come out to Pride, because they do see us sometimes as zoo animals. But other than that, I want to show them where we've come from and what we've struggled with and who we are, as human beings.” Recently, at a pre-Pride event in Cincinnati, she performed a three-part number dedicated to “people who haven’t come out yet, people who are working on coming out, and people who have just recently come out, comprised of three different songs interspersed with spoken word quotes and an intense dance routine. Kiara’s combination of gender-bending aesthetics and activist performances is a reminder of how being openly queer is a political act that requires bravery and intentionality.  Vintage Blue  Vintage Blue is a bisexual, non-binary trans man who uses he/they pronouns and started performing as a drag king around 9 months ago. His unique experiences as a transmasculine person and a drag king entering into a drag scene with few other kings gives him a much different perspective on the world and art of drag than the more established queens I talked to. They have found a sense of accomplishment through their  59 performances and success, belonging and acceptance from their drag family, and the determination to improve their craft and themselves as a person through the art of drag performance. He works to support and provide resources for drag performers and other queer people in abusive relationships by giving them ways to secretly tell others about their situation and looking out for signs of abuse in performers who seem withdrawn and upset. Vintage Blue is a prime example of a queer performer striving to be recognized for their accomplishments and create a space for themselves in a world that isn’t always kind to them.  When Vintage Blue saw his first drag show 9 months ago, he knew that he wanted to be a drag king. Because of his ADHD, autism, and dyslexia, it’s hard for him to identify with one particular thing but drag piqued his interest and gave him the opportunity to learn more about himself and be more outgoing. He defines his style as a drag king as classy, dapper, and feminine, incorporating bow ties and suspenders into most of his outfits along with colorful eye makeup that is uncharacteristic of the other drag kings he performs with. Vintage Blue prefers to perform to old-school songs from the 1950s and 60s as well as songs from musicals, which doesn’t always go over well with younger crowds. At open stage shows, they are allowed to perform two songs and at shows where they are booked they are able to perform three songs, so they always have three or four songs prepared so that they can adjust their performance plans depending on their own mood and the reception they get from the audience. They mentioned how quickly trends change in the drag scene and how performers need to actively keep up with trends and put in the hard work to prove that they are a hard worker and unique performer that other performers want to book at their shows. Vintage Blue lives in  60 Columbus but travels to Dayton, Cincinnati, Indiana, and Michigan to perform, which all have different drag communities composed of different mixtures of kings and queens with their own networks of friendships and work relationships.   As someone who doesn’t receive a lot of support and validation because of their gender identity and work as a drag king, Vintage Blue relies on the relationships they have made in their drag community. He explained his situation when he told me that:  “My family doesn't accept me for being trans, they don’t accept me being a drag king. My brother is a drag queen and they accept them perfectly fine, but when it comes to me they don't accept it. So being able to have my drag family at South Bend Tavern in Columbus- being able to have them and like accept me for me in and out of drag means a whole hell of a lot.”37 His drag family consists of his drag mother, Jennifer Lynn, of whom he is the only child because of his “big-ass head.” This drag family also includes performers like Leslie Queen and Ava Aurora Foxx and is involved in the pageant world which allows them all to keep up with the latest fashions in the world of drag. Because he works at the same bar as his drag mother, he is able to perform with her several nights a week, a privilege that not many other drag performers enjoy. Despite only being a drag king for 9 months, Vintage Blue has already had several drag children, including three he met in Michigan who are planning on moving to the Columbus area so they can all be closer to each other. Their family contains many different styles of drag performance including femme drag kings, burlesque dancers, and drag queens, and their family motto, which they apparently had no trouble deciding on is “be unique, be united.” Because of his recent entrance into                                                      37 Vintage Blue, interview by author, March 11, 2022.  61 the drag community, Vintage Blue has had a difficult time breaking into already established networks of performers who prefer to book local performers they already know instead of outsiders. To assert his place in the community, he networks at every show he performs in, has befriended other drag kings in pageants, and supports his fellow performers whenever possible. However, he says that it is still difficult to not receive much support and that not having a familiar face in the audience at a drag show “really plays with your psyche.”  Vintage Blue actively works to make his local LGBTQ+ community a healthier and more supportive place through his interactions with other drag performers and advocacy for queer victims of domestic violence. As a part of his networking, he makes a point to forge genuine friendships with other drag performers so that they will know they can trust him and be excited to see each other when they cross paths again. They see a lot of performers struggling with issue of domestic violence, and as a someone who was in an abusive realtionship themselves they are able to see the signs that something is wrong even when a person hasn’t outright told them what they’re going through. Vintage Blue tries to support people going through these tough times through subtle support and through the organization that he and his wife are founding, The Willow. Both he and his wife have been training to be life coaches and for the past five years they have planned to create an organization that “is completely for LGBTQ youth, adults, elderly wherever you fall. It has resources, it has classes, it has support groups, we're going to be doing donations, everything. And it's strictly for people that are going through these tough times.” In addition to this impressive undertaking, the husband and wife duo also run  62 their own photography business that caters to the LGBTQ+ community and shows off the beauty and uniqueness of queer lives and bodies.  Like many new drag performers, Vintage Blue is still working to establish his place in the larger community. However, he isn’t waiting on anyone else to validate him and has created communities full of acceptance for himself and the performers he cares for. He combines elements of femininity into his identity as a drag king despite the fact that many of the drag kings in his community favor strictly masculine styles of performance and costuming. They are filled with passion for drag, themselves, and their community, and they certainly have a prosperous future ahead of them.  Conclusion  Studying the history of drag as well as its contemporary practitioners is a worthwhile endeavor in the world of academia because of the inherent value of celebrating queer history and art as well as for the ways that trends in and attitudes towards drag reflect the values of a particular time and place. Over the past 100 years, gender impersonation has evolved from an entertaining mockery of gender stereotypes and cross dressing that was not tolerated outside of the world of the theater to a powerful medium for self expression that is constantly changing with each new performer that partakes in it. The effect that drag has had on popular culture cannot be understated and is a vital part of our country’s cultural heritage. However, acceptance towards LGBTQ+ people still has a long way to go, and the rights and safely of queer individuals, especially children, are under attack as this paper is being written. Ohio House Bills 454, titled “Enact the Save Adolecents from Experimention (SAFE) Act,” which would ban doctors  63 from providing gender-affirming care to transgender minors, and House Bill 616, which would prohibit “teaching-divisive, inherently racist concepts,” including LGBTQ+ history and current issues, are being put before legislators who will vote on whether some of the most vulnerable members of our society deserve full human rights in the coming months. As there can be no enjoyment of queer art without support for queer lives, we have a duty to fight against these oppresive laws and actively and openly support the LGBTQ+ community. It is my hope that everyone who has read this thesis will be inspired to respect drag performers and queer people in general and to support them, whether that is through protest and advocacy or attending a drag show and tipping the performers.     64 Bibliography   Primary Sources “A Show That Pleases All At The Lyric Theater.” Dayton Daily News.

    "abstract": "The history of gender performance is long and complex, spanning across different times and places that are each fascinating in their right and worth being studied. This thesis focuses specifically on the drag performances that take place in and around Dayton, Ohio. The research presented here is based on explorations of two distinct time periods 100 years apart from each other, the turn of the 20th century and the modern day. These two distinct times and cultures are each characterized by the performances that occurred, how they were received by audiences, the identities of the performers and the degree of social acceptance they received. This thesis uses primary data collected from archives, field observations, and oral histories to construct an accurate account of the legacies of drag performance in Dayton, cementing the importance of queer life and culture in the history of the city",
