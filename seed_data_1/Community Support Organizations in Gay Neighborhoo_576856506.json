This article provides a typology of community support organizations—includinghealthcare providers, business improvement districts, neighborhood planning organizations, and social groups and clubs—to better understand how non‐governmental organizations and non‐profit entities provide services not traditionally pro‐vided by government agencies for LGBTQ+ people. We characterize how community support organizations continued toprovide critical services to the LGBTQ+ community—consistent with the missions and aims of these organizations—whilealso providing services and information related to health and safety during the Covid‐19 pandemic.

IntroductionVolunteerism, grassroots activism, and mutual aid havebeen critical to the advancement of rights and opportu‐nities for LGBTQ+ people. These activities are institution‐ally anchored within supportive organizations embed‐ded in LGBTQ+ communities both large and small.Various types of organizations support the LGBTQ+ com‐munity by promoting the rights of individuals whoidentify as sexual minorities; these organizations alsosupport the LGBTQ+ community by providing healthand educational services and other support networks(Gato et al., 2020) at multiple scales from hyper‐localneighborhood networks to larger national and interna‐tional networks.Community support and service organizations (CSOs)serving the LGBTQ+ community reflect a decades‐long history of engaging with LGBTQ‐identifying peo‐ple. These organizations provide critical health‐ andcommunity‐related services which have often been deliv‐ered under the challenging circumstances of preju‐dice and discrimination against sexual minorities. Forexample, LGBTQ+ community organizations can supportaccess to housing and services, redress economic insta‐bility, reinforce access to medical care, and aid LGBTQ+community members in coping with fear and isola‐tion. CSOs take various forms of organization: some aresmall and informal and operate on a shoestring budget,others span international borders and are well‐fundedand highly organized, while others fall somewhere inUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 235between these two extremes. All aim to serve theLGBTQ+ population and cause. The commonality is thatCSOs, regardless of size, tend to render services tothe underserved LGBTQ+ population, offering uniquelyfocused connections that are relevant to LGBTQ+ indi‐viduals. These unique services tend to be different fromthe typical responsibilities of non‐governmental organi‐zations and government‐led ministries. Notably, CSOsstepped in to provide services when government failedto do so, and this was inarguably the case when theHIV/AIDS pandemic ravaged the LGBTQ+ community inthe 1980s and 1990s and government inaction wasaddressed—of necessity—by community organizing andgrassroots activism. LGBTQ‐focused CSOs forged newmethods to deliver necessary but at times controversialservices to underserved populations of LGBTQ+ individu‐als. New types of serviceswere required by LGBTQ+ CSOsas the people identifying as sexual minorities lived “out”un‐closeted lives and the LGBTQ+ community slowlygained greater acceptance (Seidman, 2004) and pre‐sented unique needs that were not being met by othersectors of mainstream society.In this article, we explore the various types of LGBTQ+organizations that exist—along with the missions andaims of these organizations—to better understand howthe organizations serve the communities they intend tosupport. To do so we construct a typology of LGBTQ+community organizations and clarify the goals and func‐tions of various types of organizations. We explore pub‐lic policy support for community organizations, and wecharacterize the potential funding opportunities andthe future viability of the organizations. We identifybest and noteworthy practices among organizations withsimilar functions, and we also identify innovative andunusual approaches that may become best practices inthe future.2. Background and ContextPrevious research has explored potential communityapproaches—at the local level—to address both individ‐ual and community needs for LGBTQ‐identifying people(Kay & Musgrove, 2020). The needs of LGBTQ+ peopleare rooted in disadvantage due to persecution, stigma‐tization, and discrimination. These needs cut acrosseconomic class, race, and gender identity, but are evi‐dent throughout the LGBTQ+ community. For example,access to equal and affordable housing in the LGBTQ+community is notably different from mainstream hous‐ing trends, especially for subgroups such as older gayand lesbian adults. This access is critical (Hillier &Bunten, 2020) though gay and lesbian homeowners areoften at a disadvantage in securing financing relatedto housing (Mostaghim, 2021). CSOs can help to con‐nect LGBTQ+ to housing resources, provide legal supportrelated to fair housing, and connect potential lenderswith homeowners.Similarly, CSOs provide critical support for health‐care and mental health support for the typically under‐served and marginalized LGBTQ+ community. Peoplein the LGBTQ+ community experience greater expo‐sure to stressors than the general population (Snappet al., 2015; Weinke et al., 2021). Certain subpop‐ulations in the LGBTQ+ community—especially youth(Fish et al., 2020)—experience an even higher levelof stress. Certain LGBTQ+ subpopulations struggle—especially elderly individuals—with ease of access toservices that are more readily available to non‐LGBTQ+people (Bitterman & Hess, 2016). Rejection from fam‐ilies compounds risk factors associated with the men‐tal health of LGBTQ+ youth (Snapp et al., 2015). Youthwith substance abuse or mental health concerns aremore likely to participate in LGBTQ+ community‐basedorganizations (Fish et al., 2019). For LGBTQ+ youth, thepresence of community support is a strong predictorof positive outcomes, especially in life situations andself‐esteem (Snapp et al., 2015). At the risk of poorerhealth outcomes and mental health outcomes, LGBTQ+youth engage with LGBTQ+ youth organizations andevents for support (Eisenberg et al., 2017). The com‐munity aspects of participating are particularly valuable.LGBTQ+ youth also benefit from media presence of theLGBTQ+ community and the visibility of LGBTQ+ adults(Eisenberg et al., 2017). Fish et al. (2019) conclude thatLGBTQ+ community organizations are an underutilizedresource for promoting health in the LGBTQ+ youth pop‐ulation. In response, CSOs help to connect at‐risk LGBTQ+youth with critical services and care.At the other end of the generational spectrum, olderadults who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ communityalso demand special services (Bitterman & Hess, 2016).The share of older adults (age 65 or more) continues toincreasewith an aging population in theUS, and the num‐ber of older adults identifying with the LGBTQ+ commu‐nity continues to grow and is projected to reach 20 mil‐lion in the next 40 years (Fredriksen‐Goldsen et al., 2019).Nonetheless, older adults in the LGBTQ+ community arelargely absent in specialized services and policies foraging (Fredriksen‐Goldsen, 2016; Turesky, 2021). Barriersencountered by LGBTQ+ couples in adopting children pro‐hibited the formation of multi‐generation LGBTQ+ familyunits, negatively impacting older adults and their long‐term care in the LGBTQ+ community. CSOs have begunto step in to address these entrenched inequalities.Other LGBTQ+ sub‐populations strugglewith invisibleprejudices and inequality in access to care and services.For example, in the heteronormative world, male/femalespousal access rights in healthcare situations are rarelyquestioned, however, the rights of same‐sex couples areoften scrutinized. CSOs have led the fight for equality andrecognition for LGBTQ+ couples and individuals.Participating in the organization of pride paradesand pride events gives LGBTQ+ community membersa chance to build connections—both internally andexternally—with LGBTQ+ organizations (Bruce, 2016;Joseph, 2010). Participation in LGBTQ+ events (such asUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 236gay pride parades) can increase individuals’ sense ofbelonging and lead to positive life outcomes (Hahmet al.,2017). Participation brings about a greater connectionfor individuals to the LGBTQ+ community (Montagno &Garrett‐Walker, 2021) and the non‐LGBTQ+ community.LGBTQ+ individuals who engage in community activismhelp to reduce mental health risks related to discrimina‐tion (Montagno & Garrett‐Walker, 2021). Participation inactivism among the LGBTQ+ community can result in lessinternalized heterosexism (Montagno & Garrett‐Walker,2021). These issues are important since with the chang‐ing generations there are different perspectives aboutwhat it means to identify with the LGBTQ+ community(Bitterman & Hess, 2021b). The efforts of CSOs to bringpride events into the mainstream over the past threedecades suggest the diversity of the LGBTQ+ communityand the quest to advocate for equality and acceptance.All of these important (and often unsung) efforts byCSOs provide vital services that underpin the health andwell‐being but also the vitality of gay neighborhoods.In previous research, we explain that:LGBTQ+ people migrate to new districts when theyfind safe, inclusive, and convenient access to everydayservices and amenities—especially LGBTQ‐friendlybusinesses and services—and now, perhaps nowmore so than before 1990, the presence of ser‐vices that support LGBTQ+ families including schools,libraries, childcare centers, and family healthcare facil‐ities. (Hess & Bitterman, 2021, p. 34)3. CSOs Shift as a Result of the Covid‐19 PandemicThe Covid‐19 pandemic produced shock shifts acrosscommunities. Although theCovid‐19 pandemic is a globalevent, individual community response is paramount (Kay& Musgrove, 2020); the worldwide pandemic has beenreferred to as a “ ‘glocal’ phenomenon, one with transna‐tional as well as local expressions and implications”(Miles et al., 2021, p. 396). For LGBTQ+ communitiesand organizations within gay neighborhoods, the Covid‐19 pandemic is reminiscent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic,during which the LGBTQ+ community proved itself to bewell‐equipped to respond with grassroots activism, par‐ticularly in the face of government inaction or apathy:For many LGBTQ+ people, the current situation isreminiscent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic; even thosetoo young to have experienced it first hand still grewup in its cultural shadows. This prior experience isproductive—the gayborhood is uniquely equippedto respond with grassroots activism, particularly inthe face of government inaction or apathy—but it isalso potentially problematic, as it may trigger nega‐tive memories of trauma, encourage individualisticwithdrawal from human contact, or provide historicalmodels that delimit reimagining what LGBTQ+ geogra‐phies could become. (Miles et al., 2021, p. 396)During the Covid‐19 pandemic, the mandate to quar‐antine had negative effects on the general population,but it affected LGBTQ+ individuals even more (Gatoet al., 2020; Miles et al., 2021). Lockdowns forced peo‐ple to stay at home, and financial strain and job lossforced some LGBTQ+ people to move in with relatives.Consequently, the community support offered by humanservice organizations (HSOs) was a critical need, particu‐larly among thosewho sheltered at homeduring the pan‐demic with families of origin (Drabble & Eliason, 2021;Miles et al., 2021).For LGBTQ‐identifying people, pre‐Covid‐19 mentalhealth disparities resulted in poorer outcomes duringthe pandemic (Drabble & Eliason, 2021). Certain sub‐populations of the LGBTQ+ community were more signif‐icantly impacted. For example, the daily negative effectsof the pandemic were associated with higher levels ofdepression and anxiety for LGBTQ+ youth (Gato et al.,2020). For some LGBTQ‐identifying women, substanceabuse was a means to cope with fear, stress, loneliness,and boredom (Drabble & Eliason, 2021).In this article, we focus on the special position ofgayborhoods—or urban spaceswith high shares of same‐sex couples or LGBTQ‐identifying people and/or estab‐lished acceptance for sexual minorities—as the homebase for LGBTQ+ community organizations. That is, gayneighborhoods and their gay‐identifying and straight‐identifying communities both create demand for andpro‐vide a myriad of services to support community wellbe‐ing. Researchers have argued for the need for greaterinclusion in queer space (Doan, 2015). Yet gay neighbor‐hoods have undergone significant shifts in recent years,as demographic and cultural change has made the neigh‐borhoods “less gay” as more non‐LGBTQ‐identifyinginhabit and use the neighborhoods (Bitterman, 2020;Bitterman & Hess, 2021a; Hess, 2019; Podmore, 2021).Same‐sex couples have dispersed from gay neighbor‐hoods (as the residential mix includes more non‐LGBTQ‐identifying people) and settled in other places acrossmetropolitan space (Spring, 2021) as new gay neighbor‐hoods form in other places (Bitterman, 2021).Scholarly researchers and advocacy groups are begin‐ning to examine the importance and relevance of com‐munity and social service organization (CSO) supportto LGBTQ+ communities. The Movement AdvancementProject (MAP) conducted longitudinal research onLGBTQ+ CSOs and in a 2018 report noted that in a typi‐cal week, LGBTQ+ CSOs serve 40,550 people “and refernearly 5,550 individuals each week to other agencies forservices and assistance” (MAP, 2018). Of the 113 CSOsthat reported revenue data to MAP (2018) the CSOshave “combined revenue of $226.7 million” and nearlyhalf (47%) rely, at least in part on local, state, or federalgovernment grants of more than $10,000 to continueoperations. The CSOs tracked by MAP (2018) employ“2,000 paid staff and engage with more than 14,000 vol‐unteers for nearly half a million volunteer hours” eachyear. According to the MAP (2018) study, “more thanUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 237three‐quarters of centers (78%) that engage in policy‐related activities work to advance policy at the local level,67% at the state level, and 31% at the national level.”The body of scholarship reported here—combinedwith national data from MAP (2021) about LGBTQ+CSOs—emphasizes the existence of a number ofcommunity‐based organizations providing a wide arrayof services in gay neighborhoods to the LGBTQ+ commu‐nity and the non‐LGBTQ+ community. In this way, gayneighborhoods are composed of much more than bars,nightclubs, and underwear stores (Bitterman & Hess,2021a; Hess & Bitterman, 2021). CSOs, in the functionof providing community services, can anchor neighbor‐hoods. Consequently, CSOs must be understood so thattheir capacities as key neighborhood supports can be bol‐stered by the community at large. Therefore, with thisresearch we fill a gap in scholarship concerning the vari‐ous types of CSOs that support gay neighborhoods, thefunctions andmissions of the CSOs, and how the roles ofthe CSOs have evolved from the HIV/AIDS pandemic tothe covid‐19 pandemic.4. MethodDuring the Covid‐19 pandemic, many CSOs shifted tobolster their online presence and programming. Thisprovided a unique opportunity to review changes toCSOs websites and associated programming. To meetour aim of better understanding the functions of CSOsand their roles in gay neighborhoods, we performeda survey of websites of the top LGBTQ+ CSOs basedon repeated internet searches using the DuckDuckGosearch engine. Using the terms “gay,” “LGBT,” “commu‐nity,” “neighborhood,” and “organization” the searchsurvey universe included 227 CSOs in North America(213 in the US and 14 in Canada). We further retrievedinformation about organizational leadership through asearch of LGBTQ+ community directories for cities andmetropolitan areas. For each CSO, we additionally notedits location, primary and secondary services and func‐tions, target audience(s), and mission statement. Ourdata collection occurred between May and July 2021,approximately one year after the onset of the Covid‐19pandemic. Data were collected at a single point in time,and we therefore acknowledge a limitation of this study:we cannot address changing functions over time, espe‐cially given the dynamic stressors of the Covid‐19 pan‐demic. We also noted operational changes for each CSOsin response to Covid‐19 and specific resources offeredrelating to the pandemic. Naturally, this digital survey isnot comprehensive, however, it is intended to suggest across‐sectional snapshot of CSOs’ engagement with theCovid‐19 pandemic.We recognize the grassroots and self‐organized“doers” in gay neighborhoods, like themenwho foundedGay Men’s Health Crisis in New York City or the foundersof Indy Bag Ladies in Indianapolis (Guervitz, 2016), andthe founding leaders in comparable organization in othercities. These often unsung heroes took action—whengovernments and other organizations could not or wouldnot—to ensure the health and well‐being of LGBTQ+neighbors. These efforts bolstered gay neighborhoodsand underscored themany positive benefits of gay neigh‐borhoods. By providing “Cinderella services” (Hess &Bitterman, 2021), these courageous trailblazers formedan alternative network of assistance and support for theLGBTQ+ community and helped to propel gay neighbor‐hoods as safe and convenient places to live, work, andplay. Over time, this effort was repaid through economicdevelopment, recognition, and desirability.Despite the importance of LGBTQ+ CSOs, most arelumped together and broadly identified as “gay” orga‐nizations that exist to serve the LGBTQ+ community.However, most LGBTQ+ CSOs we examined serve abroader population. The need to better identify, cat‐egorize, and recognize the efforts of these organiza‐tions requires a careful study first but also provides anopportunity to develop a basic taxonomy to understandthese organizations and benchmark and compare theirgrowth and change—and indeed their wider impact ongay neighborhoods.5. Macro Trends in LGBTQ+ CSOs During Covid‐19 asCompared to HIV/AIDSDuring the Covid‐19 pandemic, many CSOs moved ser‐vices online. For other organizations, this was not pos‐sible and some CSOs at times stepped in to fill criti‐cal needs where local, state, and regional governmentscould not. During the pandemic, because most peo‐ple were isolated at home, LGBTQ+ service organiza‐tions stepped in with innovative online programmingto provide continuity of their vital work and outreachto the community of sexual minorities, many organi‐zations also added additional service offerings such asonline pride events, online social events, and dissemina‐tion of information about Covid‐19 testing. Additionally,some LGBTQ+ service organizations in the health ser‐vices sphere also began—as they had during the earlydays of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the 1980s—to workwith the state and local governments to offer health‐related services to marginalized populations, not onlyLGBTQ+ individuals. This strong vote of confidence fromstate and local governments during a time of unprece‐dented crisis underscores the commitment with whichLGBTQ+ organizations operate and the value of the ser‐vices they offer.The LGBTQ+ community experiences significanthealth inequities related to poverty, lack of access tohealthcare, and homelessness. LGBTQ+ persons mayexperience discrimination from healthcare workers andthe general public. This discrimination has the poten‐tial to negatively impact healthcare outcomes, includingmental health and the vitality of their relationship withtheir providers. According to the National Associationof County and City Health Officials (2021), the LGBTQ+Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 238community is at a disproportionately increased risk forinfectious diseases, including sexually transmitted infec‐tions and tuberculosis. This is in part due to the effectsof systemic and structural discrimination, such as lack ofaccess to health care, discrimination within the healthcare system, and poverty or homelessness.The social determinants of health and poverty areinextricably linked. Access to healthcare is a social deter‐minant of health. LGBTQ+ persons experience a higherrisk of poverty, making them more vulnerable to ill‐ness. The Health IndicatorsWarehouse, produced by theUnited Health Foundation, found that the SSOs in theLGBTQ+ community focus on individualized support, edu‐cation, and personal growth.During crises, CSOs respond with acute interven‐tion to the challenges and hardships created by thedisparate impact of discrimination and prejudice. Thisincludes mental health functioning and individuals’ self‐actualization and self‐acceptance related to identify‐ing as a sexual minority in a heterosexual‐dominantsociety (Hess & Bitterman, 2021). The challenges thisdynamic presents can manifest in depression, alcoholand drug addiction, loneliness, domestic violence, post‐traumatic stress, and other barriers to LGBTQ+ holis‐tic wellness that may not be routinely considered ina hetero‐dominant society. Importantly, as the publicperception of LGBTQ+ changes and society becomesincreasingly more accepting and inclusive, the missionof LGBTQ+ CSOs shifts. During the Covid‐19 pandemic,many CSOs began to fulfill a double duty, serving a widerrange of clients from outside the organizations’ targetpopulations. LGBTQ+ health services organizations at theforefront of the Covid‐19 pandemic stood at the cruxof cutting‐edge public healthcare, while also faithfullyserving as community centers, for example. This wasa significant departure for some small CSOs, but ulti‐mately increased awareness and opened accessibility toa broader range of LGBTQ+ clientele.5.1. Establishing a New TaxonomyFrequently, LGBTQ+ organizations are consolidated intoa generic description that fails to recognize the diver‐sity of mission and the diversity of individuals servedamong these important entities. Examining LGBTQ+ orga‐nizations provides the means to reveal the nuances ofthe vast diversity encompassed by the LGBTQ+ commu‐nity and specifically of gay neighborhoods which serveas the physical place or “home” for community ser‐vices for sexual minority‐identifying people. While dif‐ferences are evident in the mission and target popu‐lation served by individual LGBTQ+ organizations, theend goal of each one is common: to support LGBTQ+individuals. For example, a LGBTQ‐focused health clinicprimarily serving gay men with a focus on health andwellness. This is a different mission that encompassesvastly different day‐to‐day operating objectives than aLGBTQ+ youth services organization. These organizationsserve different target populations and accordingly havedifferent missions. However, common to both is thefocus on serving LGBTQ+ individuals. Such variance isevident in the mission of LGBTQ+ CSOs. The mission ofsome LGBTQ+ CSOs is to offer a broad range of supportsincluding social services, legal advocacy, health services,and community supports, while other CSOs specialize inoffering services for a specific demographic group likeLGBTQ+ youth, LGBTQ+ older adults or retired individu‐als, LGBTQ+ people of color, gay men, or trans+ individu‐als. Still, other organizations focus on service offeringsrather than demographic groups, providing career ser‐vices, training, and placement for all LGBTQ+ individuals.While the heteronormative world may convenientlyamalgamate LGBTQ+ CSOs into a composite, we urgeresearchers engaged in LGBTQ+ scholarship to unravelthis concentrated entanglement to better understandthe nuances and individual organizations and the spe‐cific values they may provide. We consequently exam‐ine LGBTQ+ organizations by type in an effort to uncoversimilar service organizations principally in terms of mis‐sion and services offered. During the Covid‐19 pandemic,LGBTQ+ service organizations adjusted services offeredand modes of service delivery and in many cases sub‐stantially amplified the types of services offered and theclientele served. For this reason, LGBTQ+ CSOs are per‐haps more impactful in the heteronormative realm thanbefore. As LGBTQ+ CSOs have proven their importanceto the LGBTQ+ community, these same organizationsincreasingly provide value to the non‐LGBTQ+ commu‐nity. For example, learning how LGBTQ+ CSOs functionhelps us understand how these organizations anchor thedevelopment of gay neighborhoods and the urban spacein which they ground their activities. As demographicschange, and whether social acceptance of LGBTQ+ indi‐viduals increases or decreases, it is vital to identify thetypes of LGBTQ‐focused CSOs—including the missionsand visions of these important organizations—to betterunderstand LGBTQ+ cultural advancement.6. The Hess‐Bitterman Taxonomy of LGBTQ+ SocialService OrganizationsThe Hess‐Bitterman Taxonomy of LGBTQ+ CSOs catego‐rizes CSOs into six non‐exclusive broad categories basedon the functional service area of CSOs: (a) health service;(b) legal, lobbying, and advocacy; (c) business, profes‐sional networking, and boosterism; (d) social, religious,and recreational; (e) cultural and research; and (f) socialservice (including age‐specific organizations). These cat‐egories correspond to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs(Maslow, 1943). For example, health andwell‐being orga‐nizations (HWO) ensure the physiological well‐being ofLGBTQ+ individuals, while HSOs help to ensure the needfor human safety and shelter. The taxonomy is elabo‐rated in Table 1, while the interaction betweenMaslow’shierarchy of needs and the Hess‐Bitterman taxonomy isdepicted in Figure 1.Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 239Table 1.

Relationship between Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and Hess‐Bitterman distribution of community serviceorganizations.A relationship between the Hess‐Bitterman taxon‐omy and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is nearly direct:each group or “type” of CSO relates to a functional levelof Maslow’s hierarchy. For example, Maslow discussesphysiological needs as fundamental to human existence,and health‐wellness CSOs provide health and psycho‐logical support to LGBTQ+ communities. Similarly, thesense of belonging and love discussed by Maslow, weargue, is largely fulfilled by social, religious, and recre‐ation (SRO) CSOs, and so on. Like Maslow’s hierarchy,basic requirements need to be satisfied before otherscan be achieved, therefore demonstrating that a broadrange of CSOs are necessary to support LGBTQ+ individ‐uals and the actualization of gay neighborhoods, civilrights, and equality.We acknowledge that the manner by which CSOsofferings are made to individual demographic groups ormission‐focused areas will likely continue to evolve overtime. Consequently, CSOsmay shift from these proposedcategories over time, and other categories may emergeas the needs and social placement of LGBTQ+ individualscontinues to unfold. In the same way, this proposed tax‐onomy may also evolve as conditions and circumstanceschange. Certainly, no CSO can be perfectly categorizedinto only one area, and indeed, many CSOs fulfill multi‐ple missions that straddle a variety of divergent agendas,but all are in the service of advocating for or supportingLGBTQ+ individuals.6.1. Health and Well‐BeingHWOs support access to healthcare and health infor‐mation for LGBTQ+ individuals. Some of the very firstHWOs were established in the 1980s and 1990s borne ofthe necessity of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Initially, HWOshelped to fight the AIDS pandemic by focusing chieflyon HIV treatment and prevention and STD awarenessbut later began to provide other health‐related services(Wolcott et al., 1986). At the advent of the HIV/AIDS pan‐demic, governments withheld funding and heteronor‐mative healthcare organizations shunned those withHIV/AIDS, magnifying a brutal social stigma that becameassociated with HIV infection. In contrast, HSOs aimedto provide health services to LGBTQ+ individuals in adignified, non‐judgmental, and non‐stigmatized manner.Some organizations like GMHC even pursued legal actionto force the government into action (see Gay Men’sHealth Crisis v. Sullivan, 1989). Eventually and on multi‐ple fronts, HSOs succeeded and forged a new model ofcommunity‐centered healthcare in the US.Over time, HWOs began to serve other disenfran‐chised groups, fostering care for a broad range of at‐riskindividuals. Today, HWOs endeavor to ensure equalaccess to healthcare for LGBTQ+ individuals and increas‐ingly offer a complete complement of healthcare ser‐vices for LGBTQ+ individuals and families as well as thosewho do not identify with the dominant group.While HSOs were an outgrowth of the HIV/AIDS pan‐demic, HWOs possessed a strategic advantage during theCovid‐19 pandemic: these organizations had the institu‐tional know‐how to handle the public health challengesof a pandemic, and many did so with aplomb. Whilethe rest of the world was isolating and in quarantine,Evergreen Health in Buffalo, New York did not shut itsdoors. Instead, girded by the fearless courage that isthe hallmark of the organization that was firmly estab‐lished in 1983 as AIDS Community Services, EvergreenHealth partnered with New York State in the early daysof the Covid‐19 pandemic to offer coronavirus testingand to provide critical health care needs when othermedical offices and clinics were closed. This lifelinefor the LGBTQ+ community suddenly found itself inthe spotlight, providing critical healthcare not just forLGBTQ‐identifying people but for the community at large.Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 241Years before the Covid‐19 pandemic, the names ofmany HWOs changed from monikers like Gay Men’sHealth Crisis (New York City) and AIDS CommunityServices (Buffalo) to more generic‐sounding names thatunderscored the growth of the mission and reach ofthese critical organizations. For example, AIDS is increas‐ingly expunged from the name of these HWOs. In Buffalo,AIDS Community Services became “Evergreen Health.”GayMen’s Health Crisis inNewYork City formally became“GMHC Health Services.” These new names do not sug‐gest the specific population (LGBTQ+, HIV+, or otherwise)that may have been a part of the foundational missionfor these CSOs, but the commitment to inclusive LGBTQ‐focused care remains, and inmost cases grows to includea broader population of clientele at‐risk andmarginalizedby government or mainstream organizations.HWOs support the physical and psychological healthof residents of gay neighborhoods, but also invest crit‐ical resources in “anchor” projects such as walk‐in clin‐ics and care facilities, and they also support the vitalityof adjacent businesses and services, such as specializedpharmacies and group mental health counseling. Thesecritical health services serve to ensure the well‐being ofresidents of gay neighborhoods.6.2. Legal, Lobbying, and AdvocacyLegal, lobbying, and advocacy organizations (LLO) assistLGBTQ+ individuals in the ongoing fight for civil rightsby improving access to legal representation and repre‐senting LGBTQ+ individuals in civil rights and discrimina‐tion matters in the pursuit of equal rights and justice.LLOs sometimes support the LGBTQ+ community withhousing equality and affordable access, marriage equal‐ity, adoption, and workplace discrimination, and help toprovide pro bono services to those with financial con‐straints. LLOs also assist LGBTQ+ individuals in navigatingcomplex bureaucracies or the pursuit of justice. LLOsmayalso work at a broader level by influencing policy and leg‐islation to support LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, LLOsmay lobby to persuade lawmakers and politicians to sup‐port LGBTQ+ civil rights and equality, keeping these mat‐ters at the forefront of public awareness. This importantwork ensures that hard‐fought equalities for LGBTQ+ indi‐viduals remain for generations to come.Borne out of the need for advocacy, the NationalBlack Justice Coalition, Lambda Legal, Equality California,GLAAD, Equality Federation, and LPAC, all operate in theLLO sphere. In the days of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, orga‐nizations like Lambda Legal supported legal action in fed‐eral and state courts that advocated for the rights ofpeople with HIV to have access to adequate healthcare,health resources, and spousal and family rights.Similarly, during the Covid‐19 pandemic, organiza‐tions like Lambda Legal did not slow in their ongoingfight to support civil rights and equality. Most recently,Lambda Legal advocated for Sander Saba, a nonbinarytransgender New York resident who sought to obtaina New York driver’s license that accurately reflectstheir nonbinary gender identity by using the gendermarker “X” (see Saba v. Cuomo, 2021). Lambda Legalalso filed an amicus brief to the US Supreme Courtin opposition to the actions of Lorrie Smith and hercompany, 303 Creative LLC, who sought to discriminateagainst LGBTQ+ individuals by claiming religious beliefas a means to deny a same‐sex couple of services (see303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 2021). The Covid‐19 pandemic“exposed fault lines of inequality, leaving some more vul‐nerable than others regarding infection, prognosis, andeconomic impact—including within LGBT communities”(Reid, 2021), though LLOs did not slow down during thiscritical and unprecedented time.LLOs serve gay neighborhoods in a variety of ways.They do so directly, by ensuring that residents of gayneighborhoods have access to robust legal recourse inissues of housing discrimination and business develop‐ment opportunities, but also indirectly by advocatingand fighting for policy changes that ensure civil rights forresidents of all gay neighborhoods.6.3. Business, Professional, Networking, and BoosterismBusiness support, professional networking, and booster‐ism organizations (BNO) endeavor to recognize and sup‐port LGBTQ‐owned and LGBTQ‐friendly businesses andpromote LGBTQ‐friendly cities and vacation destinations.BNO include LGBTQ+ business professionals who col‐laborate and support LGBTQ‐owned and operated busi‐nesses and provide professional growth opportunities forLGBTQ+people to share expertise throughmentoring andprofessional development alongside shared promotionand marketing for independent shops and businesses,grants for business development, and tax abatement pro‐grams. Examples of BNO include the West HollywoodChamber of Commerce, the San Jose Community District,theMiami‐Dade Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce,and the Austin LGBT Chamber of Commerce.During the HIV/AIDS pandemic, BNOs supported thegrowth, development, and vitality of gay neighborhoods,which in turn provided a vitalmacroeconomy that helpedto support a critical mass for HSOs and ensured thatneighborhoodswere able to deliver the business servicesand support needed to endure the HIV/AIDS pandemic.Many of these BNOs were immensely successful. Fueledby an entrepreneurial spirit and grassroots efforts, BNOswere often the driving factor behind gay neighborhooddevelopment and sustainability.Throughout the Covid‐19 pandemic, BNOs workedas conduits for LGBTQ+ business owners to access fed‐eral support programs such as the Pandemic PaycheckProtection Program, which helped small businesses tomake payroll during a time of unprecedented shutdown.However, BNOs worked in innovative ways during theCovid‐19 pandemic, creating opportunities for onlineshopping and experiences, again demonstrating theresilience and ingenuity of BNOs.Urban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 242The efforts of BNOs are critical and became moreso during the Covid‐19 pandemic. A 2022 study by theCenter for LGBTQ Economic Advancement & Researchand MAP (2022) examined federally available data tofind that while LGBTQ+ businesses applied for loansand financing at about the same rate as non‐LGBTQ+businesses, LGBTQ+ businesses were far less likely toreceive loans or financing. LGBTQ‐owned businesseswere denied funding 11% more than non‐LGBTQ‐ownedbusinesses. Astonishingly, LGBTQ‐owned businesses“weremore likely than non‐LGBTQ+ businesses to explaintheir denial was due to lenders not approving financingfor ‛businesses like theirs’ ” (Center for LGBTQ EconomicAdvancement & Research &MAP, 2022). The report find‐ings also parallel the results of our own longitudinalresearch study that examined a sharp disparity in the dis‐persal of federal funds to LGBTQ+ organizations (Miller& Bitterman, 2021). The Center for LGBTQ EconomicAdvancement & Research and MAP (2022) showed thatthough LGBTQ+ businesses were more likely to apply forpandemic relief during the Covid‐19 pandemic they wereless likely to receive it. The study notes thatwhile amajor‐ity of LGBTQ‐ownedbusinesses applied for financial reliefin 2021 through the Paycheck Protection Program, 17%of LGBTQ+ businesses did not receive pandemic‐relatedsubsidies while 10% of non‐LGBTQ+ businesses did notreceive pandemic‐related subsidies. This finding suggeststhat LGBTQ+ businesses were denied federal pandemic‐related support at nearly double the rate of non‐LGBTQ+businesses (Center for LGBTQ Economic Advancement &Research & MAP, 2022).BNOs are especially critical to the developmentand livelihood of gay neighborhoods, but also for theeconomy at large. According to research conducted bythe National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce,LGBTQ‐owned businesses account for $1.7 trillion of theAmerican economy which, if compared with nationaleconomies around the globe, makes LGBTQ‐owned busi‐nesses, collectively, in terms of economics, 10th inthe world (Hoyos & Moll‐Ramirez, 2020; National LGBTChamber of Commerce, 2018).6.4. Social, Religious, and RecreationalSROs focus on providing opportunities for recreationand cultural enhancement that help to build a sup‐portive community among LGBTQ+ people and allies,thus promoting acceptance. Social organizations includegay social groups and drag bingo events and are oftenaffinity‐group specific. Religious‐affiliated organizationstypically provide some degree of outreach or servicesto the LGBTQ+ community through a faith‐based organi‐zation (LGBTQ Mormons is one example). Recreationalgroups, such as Pride Events, Dykes on Bikes, and vari‐ous metropolitan gay choruses, provide creative outletssituated within affirming and inclusive environments.At the onset of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, energy wasfunneled into survival and the ongoing fight for civilrights in the LGBTQ+ community. Little time was left torejuvenate or recreate in an organized manner. Largely,this need was filled by gay bars, which provided shel‐tered enclaves towhich LGBTQ+ individuals could escape.However, over time, as LGBTQ+ individuals becameincreasingly accepted by the heteronormative main‐stream, the emergence of LGBTQ‐focused recreationaland social groups emerged that promote social activities,engagement, and fellowship among LGBTQ+ individuals.LGBTQ‐affiliated faith groups followed a somewhatdifferent trajectory. While some religious organizationsworked diligently to deny LGBTQ+ individuals of basiccivil rights, other faith‐based groups stepped in to assistHSO and HWO to minister to those with HIV/AIDS.That compassionate and caring work continues today.Pope Francis has, for example, had a “moderating influ‐ence with regard to discrimination based on sexualorientation—both through his ‘who am I to judge?’stance and his refocus on critical issues of our time suchas poverty, inequality and climate catastrophe over tra‐ditional sexual moral issues” (Reid, 2021).These sorts of overtures open the door formore faith‐based LGBTQ+ support.During the Covid‐19 pandemic, large in‐person groupactivities were curtailed significantly. The pervasivesocial isolation that became a hallmark of the Covid‐19pandemic impacted LGBTQ+ individuals more signifi‐cantly than non‐LGBTQ+ individuals. Those within theLGBTQ+ community suffered greater from the loss ofsocial networks. Approximately 44% of LGBTQ+ house‐holds reported serious problems coping with social andphysical isolation during the pandemic, compared to23% of non‐LGBTQ+ households (Pezenick, 2020). Thisprompted SROs to become more ingenious in movingpride and LGBTQ‐focused events online. Moving SROofferings online did help to expand availability to audi‐ences who might not otherwise have convenient accessto such events or services.As the number of gay and lesbian bars continues todecrease (Eeckhout et al., 2021), SROs step in to delivermany of the functions that were once the exclusivedomain of gay and lesbian bars. As informal social cen‐ters of gay neighborhoods, gay bars provided the meansfor LGBTQ+ individuals to network, communicate, iden‐tify common threats, celebrate, organize, retreat, andrecreate. Now, as the number of bars rapidly diminishes,informal socialization has moved, at least in part, toonline homes and platforms. However, the power andenergy of face‐to‐face interaction should not be underes‐timated. A strong social fabric underpins each gay neigh‐borhood and SROs play a significant role in the vitalityand well‐being of nearly every gay neighborhood.6.5. Cultural and ResearchCultural and research organizations (CROs) endeavorto commemorate, investigate, and document LGBTQ+history and to advocate in the intellectual sphere forUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 243equality and recognition (Poynter & Washington, 2005)while maintaining an expansive historical record ofLGBTQ+ history and achievements. In general, CROsinclude LGBTQ+ cultural groups, LGBTQ+ libraries andarchives, LGBTQ+ history organizations,museums, aswellas student—and university‐focused groups. Examplesinclude LGBT Historical Society, Consortium of HigherEducation LGBT Resource Professionals, LGBT+ ArchivesProject of Louisiana, and the American LGBTQ Museum.At the onset of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, CROs helpedto memorialize the stories of generations of people thatwere being lost to a terrifying and deadly disease, alongwith the progression of the disease, and how otherscame to offer help.Social historian Robert W. Fieseler meticulouslyrecounted the horrific arson on June 24, 1973 at theUpstairs Lounge in New Orleans (Fieseler, 2018). Hisbook is a snapshot of not only the largest mass mur‐der of LGBTQ+ individuals in the US until the PulseNightclub shooting in 2016, but also a snapshot of howLGBTQ+ people were marginalized and shunned in theearly 1970s. Fieseler’s work would not have been possi‐ble without the meticulous records kept at New Orleans’LGBT+ Archives Project of Louisiana. These histories andevents long faded into the collective LGBTQ+ experience,are important to remember and commemorate.During the Covid‐19 pandemic, CROs helped to docu‐ment the Covid‐19 pandemic and also offered innovativeonline programming, lectures, presentations, and discus‐sions via Zoom and other digital platforms, bringing newawareness to the important and unsung work CROs doevery day. The reach and impact of the archives, cul‐ture, and scholarship are pervasive and are becomingincreasingly less place‐based, serving a wide and inter‐national audience of LGBTQ+ scholars, researchers, andcurious minds.CROs chronicle the genesis and evolution of gayneighborhoods. This critical function helps researchersto discern the driving factors that help gay neighbor‐hoods form and dissolve and how gay neighborhoodschange over time.6.6. Human Service (Including Age‐SpecificOrganizations)HSOs are, along with BNOs, perhaps the most closelyrelated to the livelihood of gay neighborhoods. HSOsensure access to food, clothing, shelter, and neces‐sary human services for LGBTQ+ individuals of all agesand income groups and in so doing ensure the dig‐nity and sustenance of LGBTQ+ individuals that live inthose neighborhoods.HSOs ensure access to critical services—food, cloth‐ing, and shelter—to members of the LGBTQ+ commu‐nity, alongside acting as a single point of contact forimportant referrals to other CSOs. LGBTQ+ individualsexperience greater exposure to stressors than the gen‐eral population (Snapp et al., 2015; Weinke et al., 2021),and some subpopulations in the LGBTQ+ community—especially youth (Fish et al., 2020)—experience an evenhigher level of stressors including rejection from fami‐lies (Snapp et al., 2015) and isolation among social peers.In this way, CSOs often fill the need for LGBTQ+ individ‐uals that heteronormative families might otherwise pro‐vide for straight individuals. Similarly, as LGBTQ+ individ‐uals age, many are childless and rely on CSOs to helpprovide care for aging.While CSOs indeed serve all members of the LGBTQ+population, CSOs especially serve younger, older, andat‐risk members of the LGBTQ+ community, includingthose with addictions and those in financial distress.Throughout the early days of the HIV/AIDS pandemic,CSOs helped to organize medical care and treatment,housing, and food delivery for people with AIDS. CSOsstepped in when government and mainstream SSOswould not. Similarly, during the Covid‐19 pandemic, CSOsmoved many programs and offerings online to ensurehousing security and food justice for members of theLGBTQ+ community impacted by Covid‐19.Through careful and considered ministry to LGBTQ+individuals, CSOs help to make gay neighborhoodsboth stable and inclusive by ensuring that everyone—regardless of financial background—has the opportunityto integrate into an inclusive and welcoming community.7. Conclusions: Takeaway MessagesThroughout the Covid‐19 pandemic, each type of LGBTQ+CSO played an important role in meeting the needsof LGBTQ+ individuals and in many cases the broaderpublic. At the time, with an unprecedented number ofunknowns related to Covid‐19 and an overall lack of plan‐ning and preparedness, government institutions scram‐bled to focus on acute crisismanagement. In the absenceof pandemic management plans in place, governmen‐tal organizations were overburdened or unable to ade‐quately deliver services. During the Covid‐19 pandemic,everyone—including businesses, human services, andhealth organizations—had to cope with sudden closuresand lockdowns. This was not experienced during theHIV/AIDS pandemic. But it was necessary to maintainservices delivered to the LGBTQ+ community—includingsocial services, acute and routine health services, etc.—during the Covid‐19 pandemic, similar to the HIV/AIDSpandemic (Miles et al., 2021).Many LGBTQ+ community organizations, however,had experienced during the HIV/AIDS pandemic deal‐ing with the upheaval caused by sickness, disease trans‐mission, and public health crises. Consequently, LGBTQ+organizations were well‐positioned to maintain continu‐ity of operations and services to some of the most vul‐nerable populations—and not only LGBTQ+ populationsbut the population in general—when public policy andgovernment efforts failed or could not keep pace withthe swift current of demand and necessity. Some LGBTQ+HWOs played a vital role in accessible Covid‐19 testingUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 244and test processing, for example. This may have helpedto stem the spread of the pandemic.The low‐rifle actions of the LGBTQ+ CSOs demon‐strated that LGBTQ+organizationswere not only efficientand capable but also resilient. This resilience is a hall‐mark of LGBTQ+ CSOs. Just as with the HIV/AIDS pan‐demic in the 1980s, during the more recent Covid‐19pandemic, LGBTQ+ CSOs overwhelmingly accepted theunprecedented challenge as a call to action. Nearly allCSOs studied did not shut down, kept offering services,and in many cases were pressed into special service ortook on additional responsibilities with little or no addi‐tional resources. LGBTQ+ CSOs were unflappable at atime when the world shut down. Undoubtedly this fear‐less ability stems from the resilience of having donethis before.Many currently working in LGBTQ+ CSOs were notyet born or were very young in the days of the HIV/AIDSpandemic. However, a “can do” spirit and attitude ofmany LGBTQ+ CSOs underscore an enduring legacy thatstems from the grassroots actions of the early activistsand advocates decades ago. Even if the new generationdid not work in community service during the AIDS cri‐sis, the legacy of the HIV/AIDS pandemic is so strong thatit acted as a beacon during Covid‐19 in supporting local,regional, and state governments in battling the Covid‐19pandemic, emanating from the LGBTQ+ community andgay neighborhoods. We offer, in this context, the follow‐ing six takeaway messages:1. LGBTQ+‐focused CSOs provide an anchor for gayneighborhoods:The MAP data (MAP, 2021) on LGBTQ+ CSOs intro‐duced earlier in this article, coupled with our explo‐ration of CSOs in gayborhoods, combine to create avivid picture of the value of community supports onthe livelihood and well‐being of gay neighborhoods.2. LGBTQ+ CSOs provide important and valuable ser‐vices for all communities, not only LGBTQ‐focusedpopulations:CSOs dramatically expanded their reach and effortsthroughout the Covid‐19 pandemic. We noted theefforts of Evergreen to support needle exchange forall residents (not just LGBTQ+ individuals), since thebeginning of the pandemic. Most CSOs broadenedservice offerings from LGBTQ‐focused to inclusive ser‐vices, helping everyone. This demonstrates, in part,that the LGBTQ+ community reflects a remarkablelevel of diversity and inclusion and is fearless in its sup‐port of marginalized groups.3. LGBTQ+ CSOs of all sorts stepped up to the plate:For the LGBTQ+ population, Covid‐19 was not the firstpandemic, and learning from AIDS/HIV gave LGBTQ+organizations time to hone their systems and opera‐tions in order to quickly and adeptly respond in anunflappable and uninterrupted manner. When therest of the world shut down during the Covid‐19 pan‐demic, LGBTQ+ organizations kept soldiering through.The LGBTQ+ community is a community of leader‐ship (Miles et al., 2021). It is also a community thatis not afraid to confront challenges and helps itselfwhen no other organizations will (and it has done sofor decades).4. CSOs continue to take responsibility for supplying com‐munities with “Cinderella services,” or the functions thatno other organization undertakes:Many services for LGBTQ+ people are not providedby other organizations. Our research and the MAPdata (MAP, 2021) both find that there are underap‐preciated organizations—working from a grassrootsmodel—engaged in “Cinderella” services for LGBTQ+people that governments fail to provide due to a lackof interest, a lack of capacity, or possibly discrimina‐tion. Despite a structural inability or unwillingness onpart of the government, LGBTQ+ CSOs provide theseservices and continued to do so throughout both theHIV/AIDS and Covid‐19 pandemics.5. There was a growing need for the digital service capa‐bilities of LGBTQ+ CSOs during the Covid‐19 pandemic:Although there is a perception that gay neighbor‐hoods are declining, we find demand for commu‐nity services (for both the LGBTQ+ and non‐LGBTQ+community), and in LGBTQ+ neighborhoods, thosedemands can be met by CSOs (Hess & Bitterman,2021). Service adaptations by CSOs during theCovid‐19 pandemic suggest that people were able tosatisfy their need for community by reaching out toneighborhood‐embedded LGBTQ+ CSOs. This is evi‐denced in modifications to LGBTQ+ events (such asgay pride events becoming virtual during the pan‐demic) and modifications to services of LGBTQ+ CSOs(Miles et al., 2021). People turned to LGBTQ+ orga‐nizations for connection in a community in the earlymonths of the pandemic, and for the most part,LGBTQ+ organizations delivered and provided com‐fort and continuity.6. LGBTQ+ digital communities received a boost fromCovid‐19:In the past, density and physical proximity equaledcommunity. Now, as people become more familiarwith digital connection, greater opportunities exist forLGBTQ+ individuals to form supportive organizationsand communities that are not necessarily place‐based(Knee& Anderson, 2021;Miles et al., 2021). For exam‐ple, digital pride events replaced in‐person paradesUrban Planning, 2023, Volume 8, Issue 2, Pages 235–248 245and became wholly inclusive and provided otherwiseexcluded or marginalized LGBTQ+ individuals to par‐ticipate and celebrate. This changed the paradigmof how we communicate and connect. Digital eventsmay represent a change with lasting value in whichLGBTQ+ people in non‐metropolitan or remote loca‐tions could readily connect to other supportive com‐munity members and organizations from a distance.These digital communities are an overlay for physi‐cal communities and can “fill in” among communitiesthat have no significant LGBTQ+ place‐based presence(i.e., rural areas), or in areas inwhich the LGBTQ+ com‐munity is more difficult to consolidate because of dis‐tance or isolation. Policy changes including commu‐nity wi‐fi and rural high‐speed internet are importantto supporting LGBTQ+ individuals in this effort.AcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge helpful insights from JustinAzzarella and Don Hinrichs and capable research assis‐tance from Mark Saba.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.References303 Creative LLC v.

    "abstract": "Volunteerism, grassroots activism, and mutual aid have been critical to the advancement of rights and opportunities for LGBTQ+ people. These activities are institutionally anchored within supportive organizations embedded in LGBTQ+ communities. But these supportive organizations can be stressed by external crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, limiting the capacity for providing routine services. This article provides a typology of community support organizations - including healthcare providers, business improvement districts, neighborhood planning organizations, and social groups and clubs - to better understand how non-governmental organizations and non-profit entities provide services not traditionally provided by government agencies for LGBTQ+ people. We characterize how community support organizations continued to provide critical services to the LGBTQ+ community - consistent with the missions and aims of these organizations - while also providing services and information related to health and safety during the Covid-19 pandemic. The article concludes with takeaway messages that synthesize the functions and services of community support organizations and explain how various types of supportive organizations in gay neighborhoods responded to the Covid-19 pandemic",
