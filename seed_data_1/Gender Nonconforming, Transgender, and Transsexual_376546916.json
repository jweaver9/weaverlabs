The current body of literature on \ntransgender health often discusses HIV rates, substance use, mental health/suicide, and few studies have \nstudies primary care seeking behaviors; this study seeks to provide new insight into the primary care (pcp) \nseeking behaviors of GNC and trans people. The primary theoretical perspectives utilized in this study \nwere West and Zimmerman’s (1987) “Doing Gender” and the Health Beliefs Mode (Ayers et al., 2007; \nConnor and Norman, 2005; Green and Murphy, 2014). In order to explore the pcp seeking behaviors \namong GNC and trans individuals, I designed a 45 item survey.  The survey was posted on-line on three \nseparate “sub-reddits” between March and April of 2016 and was open to all individuals who self-\nidentified as gender nonconforming, transgender, and/or transsexual. Of 96 responses, 68 were included. \nAlthough the sample is small, the results showed that structural barriers were significantly associated with \nhaving a PCP.  Those with health insurance (p=.031) and those with at least one chronic illness (p=.037) \nwere more likely to have a regular primary care provider.

The goals of this study are two-fold. First to establish an \nunderstanding of what variables, if any, are deterring or preventing gender nonconforming, \ntransgender, and/or transsexual people from seeking out primary care. The second is to identify \nwhat characteristics are present in those who have successfully located a primary care provider. \nThis research is being done in response to a gap in the current body of literature and will serve as \nstep towards identifying and analyzing barriers in primary care accessibility among the gender \nnonconforming, transgender, and transsexual population.   \n \nBackground \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual  \nTraditionally, the United States, like many other Western nations, has maintained a socially \nexpected gender binary – in which gender identity necessarily aligns with natal sex, or the sex \none is assigned at birth (e.g. male, female; Hendricks and Testa, 2012; West and Zimmerman, \n1987). The term “transgender” refers to a person whose gender identity, gender expression, \nand/or sexual expression does not align with their natal sex (Alegria, 2011; Hendricks and Testa, \n2012; Miller et al., 2015; Porter et al., 2016; Vance, Ehrensaft, and Rosenthal, 2014). While \n“transgender” is certainly the most recognizable term used to describe this population, it does not \nalways accurately describe a person’s identity. Although not necessarily separate from \ntransgender, “transsexual” has been used to refer to individuals who have undergone sex \nreassignment surgery and now phenotypically present as their intended gender (Alegria, 2011). \n“Gender nonconforming” (GNC) is another commonly used term to describe a person’s gender \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 2 \n \nidentity that does not normatively align with the binary (Hendricks and Testa, 2014; Porter et al., \n2016; West and Zimmerman, 1987).   \n However, no one term can accurately describe all gender identities. For example, cross-\ngender individuals often identify within the gender binary but as the opposite gender – “trans \nmen” (FtM) for those who identify as male and “trans woman” (MtF) for those who identify as \nfemale (Hendricks and Testa, 2012; Nadal et al., 2012). There are, however, GNC and trans \nindividuals who do not maintain identities within the binary. These identies may include, but are \ncertainly not limited to: androgynous, genderqueer, third gender, and two-spirit (Hendricks and \nTesta, 2012; Nadal et al., 2012).  \n \nGNC and Trans Health \nSince the 1990s, there has been an increasing body of literature specific to GNC and trans health. \nAlthough there is little to no literature regarding primary care seeking behaviors in the GNC and \ntrans population specifically, the available literature provides insight into extremely important \naspects of healthcare: HIV prevalence and prevention, substance overuse and abuse, mental \nhealth and suicidality, barriers to care, and standards of care for GNC and trans people. A \nnumber of studies have found that GNC and trans individuals face disproportionately high \ninfection rates of HIV, often as a result of unprotected sex and/or the sharing of needles during \nintravenous drug use or hormone use; HIV rates are particularly high among the male-to-female \n(MtF) population (Bradford et al., 2013; Clements-Nolle et al., 2001; Garofalo et al., 2006; \nHerbst et al., 2007; Kenagy and Bostwick, 2005; Nemoto et al., 2004). Substance abuse is also a \ncommon health concern among GNC and trans individuals; often, feelings of marginalization, \nstigma, and mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, etc.) are attributed as the reason for an \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 3 \n \nincreased rate of substance abuse in this population (Bentosch et al., 2013; Hughes and Eliason, \n2002; Jordan, 2000). Mental health disorders and suicidality, as mentioned in regards to \nsubstance abuse, are quite prominent (Burgess et al., 2007; Clements-Nolle, Marx, and Katz, \n2006; Grossman and Augelli, 2007; Haas et al., 2011; Mathy, 2002; Mustanski, Garafalo, and \nEmerson, 2010; Walter et al., 2013). Although it may be difficult to say with complete certainty, \nthe root of many of these disorders is often thought to be societal stigma, marginalization, and \nisolation.  \n Although there have been improvements in healthcare accessibility and utilization for \nGNC and trans people, the healthcare system in the United States does not fully accommodate \nGNC and trans people, thus leaving the population underserved and unable to receive \ncomprehensive healthcare (Feldman and Bockting, 2003; Rublin, 2015). GNC and trans \nindividuals report a consistent inability to access adequate healthcare due to a lack of \nappropriately trained medical professionals, episodes of discrimination and refusal of service on \nthe part of medical professionals, social stigma surrounding gender identity, fear of violence or \nabuse as a result of gender identity, and the like (Bradford et al., 2013; Cruz, 2014; \nHatzenbuehler, 2009; Kmietowicz, 2015; Miller and Grollman, 2015; Poteat, German, and \nKerrigan, 2013; Safer et al., 2016; N. Sanchez, J. Sanchez, and Danoff, 2007; Witten, 2014; \nWitten, 2016; Witten and Eyler, 1999; Witten and Eyler, 2012). In response to this, a growing \nbody of literature has begun to provide resources for healthcare professionals that are designed to \nhelp combat stigma and discrimination while simultaneously increasing quality of care in GNC \nand trans people (Coleman et al., 2012; Lombardi, 2001; Poteat, German, and Kerrigan, 2013; \nSafer et al, 2016; Vance, Ehrensaft, and Rosenthal, 2014).  \n \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 4 \n \nTheory \nDoing Gender and Doing Heteronormativity \nAmerican society typically maintains gender as a binary phenomenon and those who do not \nnormatively align with this binary are seen as nonconformist (West and Zimmerman, 1987). The \nUnited States has historically not offered social space, public recognition, or support for those \nwho deviate from normatively assumed gender identities and, as a result, GNC and trans people \nare often met with confusion, hostility, and, in extreme cases, violence (West and Zimmerman, \n1987).  West and Zimmerman’s (1987) proposition challenges the normative assumption of \ngender and offers the argument that gender is a socially constructed phenomenon rather than \nbeing inherently linked to natal sex. This position challenges the foundation of the gender binary \nand attempts to remove all traits assumed to be inherent with masculinity and femininity. A \nmajor problem, however, is that social institutions serve as vessels in the replication of \ntraditionally dichotomized gender identities while simultaneously devaluing those of gender \nminorities or nonconformists. This is done through the process of “doing gender” (West and \nZimmerman, 1987). \n One “does gender” on the daily basis – simple behaviors, clothing choices, speech \npatterns, and how others perceive you all factor into gender (West and Zimmerman, 1987). This \ninterpretation of gender is contrary to the biological understanding of gender, which asserts that \nthere are inherently masculine or feminine behaviors. This perspective posits that gender is a \nwholly social and psychological construct and that it is maintained and replicated through social \ninteraction and social institutions (e.g. media, legal statute, etc.). In this context, GNC and trans \nindividuals, as well as individuals who maintain “normative” gender identities, are constantly \nacting in ways to maintain gender expression and identity. The difference, however, is that GNC \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 5 \n \nand trans population must navigate a system that expects conformity and does very little to cater \nto anything but the norm.      \nExpanding on West and Zimmerman’s concept of “doing gender”, Schilt and Westbrook \n(2009) introduce the idea of “doing heteronormativity”. This perspective seeks to address the \nissue of gender nonconformity alongside the concept of heteronormativity. As with normative \ngender identities, heterosexuality is often assumed to be the norm in the United States. The \ngender binary creates a power struggle that favors both masculinity and heterosexuality; those \nwho identify and possess these qualities often have more “class status, power, and privilege than \nothers,” (Schilt and Westbrook, 2009). Societal preferences and assumptions such as these \nmaintain an atmosphere of heterosexism, homophobia (the irrational fear or hatred of \nhomosexuals), and transphobia (the irrational fear or hatred of transgender and/or gender \nnonconforming individuals) (Schilt and Westbrook, 2009). Conflict then arises when the \nnormative assumptions of gender and sexuality are perceived to be challenged or interrupted.  \nThese interruptions disrupt the mainstream, heterosexist logic which may, and often does, lead to \nadverse reactions from normatively gendered individuals (Schilt and Westbrook, 2009). These \nreactions can range from personal disdain or confusion to overt expressions of anger or violence \ndirected at transgender or gender nonconforming people (Schilt and Westbrook, 2009).   \nAn interesting and important point to remember is that in most interactions and social \nencounters, traditionally gendered people and gender nonconforming or transgender people are \nindistinguishable (Schilt and Westbrook, 2009). One situation in which a high likelihood of risk \noccurring is in sexual encounters; in these instances, the physical body is presented in its entirety \nand any differences between gender identity and natal sex can be observed (Schilt and \nWestbrook, 2009). The overt presentation of the exposed body can be paralleled to the medical \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 6 \n \nencounter (Witten, 2014 (a); Witten, 2014 (b)). Dissimilar to sexual situations, medical \nencounters often occur in professional environments with certain expectations and regulations in \nplace. The potential conflict is that, while medical professionals receive specialized training and \nare often viewed as unbiased, they are still subject to the same reaction as any other traditionally \ngendered individual. Experiences or the expectation for experiences such as these can be \ndeterrents for GNC and trans people who are considering seeking out primary care (Witten, 2014 \n(a); Witten, 2014 (b)). \n \nHealth Beliefs Model \nThe Health Beliefs Model (HBM) (Ayers et al., 2007; Connor and Norman, 2005; Green and \nMurphy, 2014) is a useful lens through which to think about trans health seeking behavior. Since \nthe mid-1900’s the (HBM) has been one of the most often used psychosocial approaches to \nexplaining health-related behaviors (Ayers et al., 2007; Connor and Norman, 2005; Green and \nMurphy, 2014). This model is intended to explain and predict health-related behaviors based \nupon individual beliefs and attitudes (Ayers et al., 2007; Connor and Norman, 2005; Kirscht, \n1974; Schnall, Rojas, and Travers, 2015). Often, this model seeks to examine two types of \nbehaviors: (preventative) health behaviors and illness behaviors. Health behaviors are those that \na person does in order to prevent disease or to detect a disease in its asymptomatic stage (Kasl \nand Cobb, 1966; Rosenstock, 1974). Contrarily, an illness behaviors are those that a person does \nin order to diagnose an illness and discover a suitable treatment (Kasl and Cobb, 1966; \nRosenstock, 1974).  \nThe health belief model suggests that an individual’s health behaviors are impacted by \ntheir: beliefs about a health concern (perceived susceptibility and severity); perceived benefits, as \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 7 \n \nwell as barriers to action; and perceived self-efficacy, or one’s perceived ability to succeed in a \nsituation and/or accomplish a desired task (Schnall, Rojas, and Travers, 2015). All of these \nfactors are then considered in context – individual demographic characteristics, racial identity, \nsexual and gender identity, physical access to healthcare treatment, health insurance status, peer \nbehavior, etc. These characteristics are known as “modifying factors” (Schnall, Rojas, and \nTravers, 2015).  \n \n \nFigure 1 Health Beliefs Model – Adapted from Melina Butterworth’s Explanation of the HBM \nIn the context of the current study, the HBM can be used to explain many of the reasons \nwhy GNC and trans individuals do not utilize preventative and comprehensive primary care. \nStudies have shown that, even if GNC and trans people are able to receive healthcare, many feel \nreluctant to and will postpone doing so, often due to discrimination (Bradford et al., 2013; Cruz, \n2014; Grant et al., 2011; Kidd & Witten, 2008; Jackson, Johnson, and Roberts, 2008; Redman, \n2011; Witten, 2014 (a); Witten, 2014 (b); Witten, 2016; Witten and Eyler, 1999; Witten and \nEyler, 2012). While discrimination is a clear deterrent for many individuals, there may be other \nvariables that impact GNC and trans decision-making. This population is at a disproportionately \nhigh risk of employment discrimination and poverty (thus affecting income and insurance status; \nBradford et al., 2013; National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 2009; Witten, 2014; Witten, \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 8 \n \n2016), as well as social and psychological abuse and violence (Bradford et al., 2013; Grant et al., \n2011; Jauk, 2013; Lombardi et al., 2001; Merry, 2006; National Transgender Discrimination \nSurvey, 2009; Nuttbrock et al., 2010; Nuttbrock et al., 2013; Witten, 2014 (a); Witten, 2014 (b); \nWitten and Eyler, 1999; Witten and Eyler, 2012). While it may not be the case in every situation, \npast experiences such as these could serve as current barriers to seeking primary care.   \n \nMethodology \nInstrument \nThe survey instrument consisted of an information and consent form, a preliminary questionnaire \nto determine eligibility to participate, and a 45-item survey. The items of the survey were \ndeveloped based upon the exploratory goals of this study; many questions utilized from previous \nstudies on patient access to primary care and/or transgender health research. The survey was \nprimarily quantitative in nature, but often allowed participants to elaborate or provide further \ndetail to their answers. I am not classifying this study as wholly mixed-method as the qualitative \ncomponent was not substantial enough and was not heavily examined in analysis. The purpose of \nincluding open-ended questions was two-fold. The primary purpose was to allow participants to \nelaborate upon answers that would otherwise be reductive, while a secondary purpose was to \nensure that all aspects of a phenomena could be captured, as the study is exploratory in nature.  \n The survey was broken up into 6 sections. Section 1 dealt with questions regarding the \nparticipants’ gender and sexual identity, as well as presentation to others. Section 2 requested \ndemographic information from participants (e.g. educational attainment, employment status, \nhousehold income, etc.). Section 3 asked specifically about health insurance status and insurance \nprovider. Section 4 focused on points regarding primary care. Section 5 asked whether the \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 9 \n \nparticipant utilizes specialty medical care. Section 6 asked more general questions about the \nAmerican health care system and participants’ past experiences within this system.   \n \nData Collection Sources  \nData were collected through the use of an online, forty-five item, self-administered survey (see \nAppendix I). The survey was posted to the website www.reddit.com. Specifically, a short call for \nparticipants was posted along with a link to the following “subreddits”: reddit.com/r/samplesize, \nreddit.com/r/asktransgender, and reddit.com/r/transhealth. While each of these “subreddits”, or \n“subs”, are hosted through reddit.com, it is important to note that each acts as an independent \nblog with a specialized focus. Reddit.com/r/samplesize is specifically designed for individuals to \npost questionnaires and surveys of any kind for the subscribers of this “sub” to see. Similarly, \nreddit.com/r/asktransgender is a space designed for anyone to pose questions to the trans \ncommunity, while reddit.com/r/transhealth is dedicated to discussing and sharing information \nregarding anything relating to the health of the trans community. In order to ensure proper \netiquette, the moderators of each sub were contacted prior to posting the call for participants. Six \n“subs” were contacted, and three responded with messages allowing me to post. The original \nposts were made on February 8, 2016 and were reposted to reddit.com/r/samplesize and \nr/transhealth on March 23, 2016 and March 25, 2016 respectively. The survey remained active \nuntil April 2, 2016. I would like to note that this period of time was extremely short and may \nhave contributed to the small sample size used in this study. Time constraints due to academic \ncalendars and timeframes were the primary reason for the short timeframe for data collection.   \n \nEligibility Criteria \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 10 \n \nThe eligibility of potential participants was based on the following four criteria: that the \nrespondent 1) be at least age 18, 2) be able to speak and understand English, 3) be an American \ncitizen, and 4) self-identified as gender nonconforming, transgender, and/or transsexual. To \ninsure confidentiality, participants were not asked any identifiable information and were \nreminded on several occasions to refrain from disclosing any details that could in any way \nidentify them (i.e. geographic location, last names, phone numbers, physician names, etc.). Also, \nparticipants were not asked to sign any documents; instead, an electronic consent form was \npresented to all participants prior to beginning the survey. In order to begin the survey, the \nparticipant was told to read the form in its entirety and then check a box indicating that they had \nread the consent form and agreed to participate in the study. Respondents were not provided \ncompensation for this study and participation was wholly voluntary.  \n \nMeasures \nGender and Sexual Identity. The first section in the survey instrument inquired about the \nrespondents’ gender and sexual identities as they perceive them and as how they feel others \nperceive them. As respondents could select multiple identities, the categories were collapsed for \npractical analytical purposes. In the case of the respondent’s gender as perceived by others, the \ncategories were collapsed into four options – 1. Transgender (if transgender was marked), 2. \nTranssexual (if transsexual was marked), 3. Neither transgender nor transsexual (if neither \ntransgender nor transsexual was marked), 4. Both transgender and transsexual (if both \ntransgender and transsexual were marked). Gender self-perception was also recoded in a similar \nfashion with five categories – 1. Transgender (if the individual marked transgender but did not \nmark their natal sex or their gender presentation), 2. Trans-man/Man of trans experience (if the \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 11 \n \nindividual marked a transgender identity and also noted a masculine/male gender identity), 3. \nTrans-woman/Woman of trans experience (if the individual marked a transgender identity and \nalso noted a feminine/female gender identity), 4. Genderqueer/Gender Nonconforming (if the \nindividual did not mark transgender in any way, but did mark genderqueer or another gender \nnonconforming identity), 5. Other. No disrespect was intended towards any participants who \nmay not maintain any of these identities; the GNC and trans population is diverse and identities \ndo not always fit into analytical boxes. This section also included a question about “outness” \n(how aware others are of respondent’s gender identity), sex shown on driver’s license, and sex \nassigned at birth.  \n \nDemographics. Demographic characteristics included educational attainment (high school or \nless, some college/vocational, bachelors or higher), employment status (full-time, part-time, \nunemployed, student), annual household income (<$15,000, $15,000-$54,999, $55,000<), \nrelationship status (single, long-term relationship, cohabitating, married, other), living status \n(alone, with significant other, parent, child/relative, friend/roommate), whether or not they have \na child under the age of 18, and geographic region (city, suburbs, or rural). Racial identity, which \ninitially included six categories was recoded to the dichotomous variable 1. White and 2. Non-\nwhite; the purpose of this was to ease analysis and was in no way meant to offend any \nindividuals whose identity does not align with these categories.  \n \nHealth Insurance Status. Respondents reported their health insurance status and, if they had \nhealth insurance, what kind of policy it was: employee based (private), individual plan (private), \nMedicare/Medicaid (public), other.  \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 12 \n \n \nPrimary Care Provider Status. Respondents were asked if they currently have a primary care \nprovider and if they had ever had difficulty locating a primary care provider. For this study, \nprimary care provider was defined as “the person that you see for your regular medical care”. If \nthey responded that, yes, they do have a primary care provider, they were prompted with \nquestion regarding: how they located their primary care provider, how comfortable they are with \ndiscussing their gender/sex status with their primary care provider (recoded to the dichotomous \nvariable: very uncomfortable/uncomfortable or very comfortable/comfortable), how \nknowledgeable their primary care provider is about their gender/sex-related health concerns, and \nif they had any fears or concerns about discussing their health with their primary care provider.   \n \nSpecialty Care Status. Participants were asked to report any specialty care that they receive (e.g. \nendocrinologist, gynecologist, etc.). If they did report utilizing specialty care, they were asked \nwhat type of specialty care and if this specialist was their primary care provider. The purpose \nhere is to be as inclusive as possible as some GNC or trans individuals may be undergoing \nhormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery, which may lead them to having a specialist \nprimary care provider.  \n \nGeneral Health. The survey also sought to examine self-assessed health, particularly in \nrelationship to the health beliefs model. In this section, participants were asked if they had any \nchronic illnesses and, if so, what they were – this was recoded into three categories for analytical \npurposes: 1. No chronic illness, 2. One or two chronic illnesses, and 3. Three or more chronic \nillnesses. In this section, participants were also asked if they had any difficulties receiving care in \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 13 \n \nthe last calendar year, general difficulty receiving health care, whether or not they had ever \nexperienced discrimination on the part of health care providers, and if they have ever had to \neducate medical professionals about their health care needs as a GNC or trans person.   \n \nData Analysis \nI used IMB SPSS statistical software 23 to perform my analysis. Chi-square tests for significance \nwere utilized to determine if there were any significant associations between participant \ncharacteristics and primary care status. All tests for significance were done at a p<.05 level. \n1. Demographic Characteristics. I analyzed all demographic variables to examine their \nassociation with primary care provider status. In these bivariate analyses, primary care \nprovider status (survey item 27) was the independent variable. Dependent variables \nincluded in this analysis were: recoded gender self-perception, recoded gender perception \nto others, age, recoded racial identity, recoded employment status, recoded household \nincome, regional location, relationship status, living status, and child status. These \nvariables were included in analysis due to the body of literature regarding \nemployment/housing discrimination, high rates of poverty, and fear of abuse or rejection \nof care due to GNC or trans gender identity (Bradford et al., 2013; Grant et al., 2011; \nJauk, 2013; Lombardi et al., 2001; Merry, 2006; National Transgender Discrimination \nSurvey, 2009; Witten and Eyler, 1999). Analysis of regional location is based on \nliterature discussing accessibility of healthcare based on urban, suburban, or rural \nlocation (Arcury et al., 2005; Arcury et al., 2005; Fields and Briggs, 2001; Martinez-\nDonate et al., 2013).   \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 14 \n \n2. Health Care. Health-related variables were also analyzed in order to examine their \nrelationship with the independent variable “primary care provider status”. The dependent \nvariables in these bivariate analyses were: self-assessed health, chronic illness status, \ninsurance status, insurance type, whether or not they had difficulties locating a primary \ncare provider, how they located their primary care provider, their comfort in discussing \ngender/sex-related health concerns with their primary care provider, and whether or not \nthey have had to educate their primary care provider about their health needs. Questions \nregarding self-assessed health, chronic illness status, and perceived ability to receive \nhealthcare were included based on literature regarding health trends in the GNC and trans \npopulation, as well as literature regarding the HBM (Ayers et al., 2007; Bradford et al., \n2013; Connor and Norman, 2005; Cruz, 2014; Kirscht, 1974; Schnall, Rojas, and Travers, \n2015). Patients educating medical professionals was also included as it has been reported \nto be an exhausting process and serve as a barrier to care seeking (Bradford et al., 2013).  \n \nResults \nOut of an original sample of 96 responses, 68 were usable for the purposes of this study. 22 of \nthe 28 responses excluded did not provide answers for sections 3, 4, and 5; the remaining 6 did \nnot answer any questions following section 1. The exclusion of these answers meant that there \nwas little to no information regarding their experience in the healthcare system.  \n \nDemographic Characteristics \nThe mean sample age was 27.78 years (SD = 7.069 years). The majority of the sample self-\nidentified as sexual minorities (4.4% gay, 19.1% lesbian, 29.4% bisexual, 7.4% asexual, 17.6% \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 15 \n \npan/omni sexual, 10.3% questioning, and 2.9% queer); approximately two-thirds (66.2%) of \nrespondents self-identified as transgender (4.4% transgender, 14.7% transmen/men of trans \nexperience, 47.1% transwomen/women of trans experience) while 11.8% self-reported \ngenderqueer or gender nonconforming identities; nearly the entire sample (91.2%) reported \nWhite racial/ethnic identities; just over half (52.9%) of respondents report being single. In terms \nof educational attainment, 41.2% of participants reported having some college or vocational \ntraining and 45.6% reported having a Bachelor’s degree or higher; 20.6% were unemployed, \n35.3% reported being students, 4.4% maintain part-time work schedules (not including students), \nand 39.7% maintain full-time work schedules; one quarter (25%) of respondents reported annual \nhousehold incomes below $15,000. In terms of geographic location, the majority of the sample \nreported living in a city (69.1%) while 11.8% lived in rural regions and 19.1% in suburban \nregions. \n \nHealthcare Access and Primary Care Characteristics \nThe majority of respondents self-reported having a current health insurance policy (85.3%). Of \nthose who reported having health insurance, 91.3% reported holding private insurance policies \n(employer policy 60.3% and individual policy 31%), and 8.7% held public insurance policies \n(Medicare/Medicaid). Roughly half of the respondents self-reported previous difficulty locating \na primary care provider (52.9%) and over half reported currently having a primary care provider \n(69.1%); 38.2% report utilizing specialist care (primarily endocrinologists, gynecologists, and \nmental health professionals), and of those utilizing specialist care, 10.3% of respondents use \nthese specialists as primary care providers. \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 16 \n \n In terms of comfort among those who currently have primary care providers (n=47), 34% \nreported being “very uncomfortable/uncomfortable” when discussing gender/sex status and \nrelated health care needs with their primary care providers; in this same group, 64.4% of people \nsaid that their current primary care provider is either “knowledgeable/very knowledgeable” about \ntheir gender/sex-related health care concerns and needs; the majority of respondents (55.9%), \nhowever, reported ever having to educate their doctor or health care provider about their needs as \na GNC or trans person. The majority of respondents (63.2%) have never experienced \ndiscrimination by a doctor or other health care provider due to their gender or sex \nstatus/expression and 57.5% either said they “strongly disagree/disagree” with the following \nstatement: “Medical professionals treat gender nonconforming/transgender/transsexual patients \nwith the same amount of respect as their other patients.”     \n \nHealth and Illness Characteristics \n36.4% of respondents reported having a “very difficult/difficult” experience receiving health care \nwhen they needed it, and 72.1% of said that, in the past 12 months, they have not had any \ndifficulties accessing medical care. The majority of respondents self-reported having no chronic \nillnesses (67.6%), while 14.7% reported having one or two chronic illnesses and 17.6% having \nthree or more. \n \nBivariate Analysis \nFinally, as illustrated in tables 1 and 2, bivariate analyses between sociodemographic, health care \naccess, and health/illness characteristics and the presence of having a PCP, revealed only two \nstatistically significant relationships: health insurance status and PCP status (p=.031) and chronic \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 17 \n \nillness status and PCP status (p=.037; see Table 1). The closest any other associations \napproaching significance were: household income and PCP status (p=.056) and past difficulties \nobtaining care and PCP status (p=.055). There are, however, notable points to consider from \ndescriptive analysis.   \n \nDiscussion \nThe results of this study provide some insight into the experiences of GNC and trans individuals. \nConsistent with the HBM, participants who had health insurance were more likely to have a \nprimary care provider; the presence of health insurance removes a prominent fiscal barrier to \nreceiving healthcare (Ayers et al., 2007; Connor and Norman, 2005; Kirscht, 1974; Schnall, \nRojas, and Travers, 2015).  Also, participants who had at least one chronic illness were more \nlikely to have a primary care provider; this behavior falls more clearly in-line with illness \nbehaviors, that is, behaviors that come in response to an illness/disorder (Kasl and Cobb, 1966; \nRosenstock, 1974).  \n In line with research on primary care access in the general population, GNC and trans \nindividuals reported having economic barriers to care (Afilalo et al., 2008; Cheung, Willer, and \nGinde, 2011; Cheung, Willer, and Ginde, 2011; Cheung et al., 2012; D’Avolio et al. 2013; \nNewacheck et al., 1998). As mentioned, a statistically significant relationship existed between \nhealth insurance status and primary care provider status; another near significant relationship \nexisted between annual household income and primary care status. These findings suggest that if \nan individual has a valid health insurance policy, regardless of type, as well as an income level \nabove $15,000 per year, then they are more likely to have a primary care provider. The GNC and \ntrans population is at a disproportionately higher rate of poverty, which may be extremely \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 18 \n \nimportant in understanding primary care-seeking behaviors and barriers (National Transgender \nDiscrimination Survey, 2009). Socio-economic variables and characteristics appear to be key \nfactors in primary care seeking.  \n Another important aspect to primary care access is geographic location. While there was \nno clear statistical relationship between geographic region and primary care status, there were \nresponses that made it clear that access to care was impeded by their distance to a reliable, \ntrained care provider. For example, respondents reported that they had difficulties finding \nproviders because they were “living in an area with a lack of trans-knowledgeable/friendly \nproviders,” “in an extremely rural area and looking for LGBT-friendly coverage,” “[in an area \nwhere] many local physicians are not comfortable with transgender patient treatment,” “[in a] \nvery rural area. . . [and] the next closest doctor that they could refer me to is 4 hours away.” As \nwith standard medical care, lack of transportation or nearby medical care is a barrier to access \n(Arcury et al., 2005; Arcury et al., 2005; Fields and Briggs, 2001; Martinez-Donate et al., 2013). \nAn added dimension to this situation is that many of the respondents reported that there were, in \nfact, primary care providers nearby; however, they did not feel comfortable seeking them out \nand/or were not welcome in their offices due to trans-related discrimination. \n Fear of discrimination, feeling uncomfortable with certain physicians, and outright \nrefusal of services were also reported as reasons for why respondents had difficulty accessing \nprimary care identity (Bradford et al., 2013; Grant et al., 2011; Jauk, 2013; Lombardi et al., \n2001; Merry, 2006; National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 2009; Witten and Eyler, \n1999). Not only this, respondents also report many situations in which the physician was willing \nto provide care, but had not received the appropriate training to provide appropriate care for them \nas a GNC or trans person. These findings show that policy-level changes must occur within the \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 19 \n \nmedical system – physicians and other healthcare providers need to be receiving training on how \nto appropriately treat GNC and trans individuals.  \n Respondents who have successfully located primary care providers often reported having \nsupport from peers or their community, hearing about the provider through word-of-mouth, or \nstaying with a provider that they have had since childhood/adolescence.   \n \nLimitations \nThere are several limitations to consider for this study. The current sample study is probably \nnon-representative. Participants were recruited via the use of non-probability sampling methods, \nonly participants who had access to a working computer with internet access and a knowledge of \nwww.reddit.com could participate in this study, and the sample size is quite small. Because of \nthis, the findings are not generalizable; the sample was not large enough and was probably non-\nrepresentative. Additionally, being that the sample was small and non-probability, inferential \nstatistics were not practical, limiting my ability to examine associations.   \n Secondly, by hosting the study through reddit.com, the participants’ demographic \ncharacteristics are probably not representative of the GNC and transgender populations as a \nwhole. The quantity of White, college student/college educated respondents is much higher than \none would expect in a representative sample. To give some insight, the demographic makeup of \nreddit.com looks something like this: male, White, non-Hispanic, 18-29 years, have some college \nor a college degree, and live in an urban/suburban region (Duggan and Smith, 2013). Income \nlevels are equally distributed based on descriptive analysis (Duggan and Smith, 2013). Although \nthis is likely not representative, it does align with other, more large-scale research done on the \ntrans population. Witten (2014; 2016) conducted online research and found that, much like the \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 20 \n \ncurrent study, most respondents were White, health literate, and educated. These results likely do \nnot provide clear insight into the rest of the trans population, but remain consistent.  \n Due to the nature of the study, participants were allowed to leave any question \nunanswered. This was a major problem in terms of inclusion in the study and analysis. If a \nparticipant failed to answer vital questions, even if it was one or two, they were excluded from \nthe study entirely. Another inherent limitation with this study is that all responses were self-\nreported and, thus, are open to interpretation. Unfortunately, there were no methods available for \nparticipants to ask questions or clarify any concerns they may have with the instrument.  \n  \nConclusion \nLimitations notwithstanding, this study serves as an entry into the untapped study of primary \ncare-seeking behaviors among the GNC and trans populations and provides insight into some of \nthe reasons GNC and trans people do not seek primary care, as well as what characteristics are \noften present in those who have done so successfully. In this sample, the variables that primarily \nimpacted primary care status were structural and traditional health.  \nI would like to mention that this research is likely the “best of the worst”. What I mean is \nthat, based on this sample and the online samples of other research on trans health, the \nparticipants were educated, health literate, and, more often than not, financially secure (Witten, \n2014; Witten, 2016).  \nThis research adds to the body of literature surrounding GNC and trans healthcare and \nsupports the notion for structural changes and policy implications for the improvement of care \nand access to care. Future research in this field should utilize a larger, more diverse sample in \norder to provide more clear insight into the true experiences of the population as a whole. Online \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 21 \n \nresearch may be a good way to reach participants; however, posting should be done on multiple \nvenues in an effort to increase the reach of the study. \nHuman Participation Protection \nThis study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Virginia \nCommonwealth University (Appendix II, III). \n    \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 22 \n \nReferences \nAfilalo, Jonathan, Marinovich, Adrian, Afilalo, Marc, Calocaone, Antoniette, Leger, Ruth, \n Unger, Bernard, and Giguère, Claudine. 2008. “Nonurgent Emergency Department \n Patient Characteristics and Barriers to Primary Care”.

Vinneau \n \nVCU IRB NO.: HM20005503 \n \nPURPOSE OF THE STUDY \n \nThe purpose of this research study is to explore the experiences of adult, English-speaking \ngender nonconforming, transgender, and transsexual individuals while searching for a primary \ncare provider. Please keep in mind that, for the purposes of this study, primary care refers to the \npatient's first point of entry into the health care system and as the continuing focal point for all \nneeded health care services (AAFP, 2015).  \n \nThe input received from this study has the potential to bring attention to an otherwise \noverlooked issue amongst the transgender community. \n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AND YOUR INVOLVEMENT  \n \nAfter reading this document, you will be asked to complete a forty-five item survey consisting of \nmultiple-choice, yes/no, and open-ended questions. It is important to remember that no \nidentifiable or personal information should be shared in the completion of this survey (e.g. \ngeographic location, any names, phone numbers, etc.). \n \nThis questionnaire asks about things like gender identity, your employment status, how much \nmoney is made by the people in your house, if you have health insurance, your experience \nfinding a primary care provider, how healthy you think you are, and your past experiences in the \nAmerican health care system. \n \nAll answers will remain anonymous. Any and all identifiable data will remain confidential and \nunreleased in the final stages of analysis and reporting. Participation in this study is completely \nvoluntary and you may stop the survey at any time before hitting the “submit” button. Once your \nanswers have been submitted, however, there will be no way of identifying which \nsubmission is yours and, thus, no way to remove your submission. \n \nRISKS AND DISCOMFORTS \n \nPlease be aware that this study has the potential to be uncomfortable for many individuals. In \nthe event that you become uncomfortable or upset in any way, I have attached the contact \nnumber of the following resources. \n “Trans Lifeline” for the United States: 1-877-565-8860 \no 24 hour hotline \no Information about Trans Lifeline from their website: “Trans Lifeline is a \n501(c)3 non-profit dedicated to the well-being of transgender people. We run a \nhotline staffed by transgender people for transgender people. Trans Lifeline \nvolunteers are ready to respond to whatever support needs members of our \ncommunity might have.” \nGender Nonconforming, Transgender, and Transsexual Patient Navigation 46 \n \n \n GLBT National Hotline: 1-888-843-4564 \no Monday-Friday: 1pm – 9 pm Pacific Standard Time (PST) \no Saturday: 9 am – 2 pm PST \no Monday-Friday: 4 pm – Midnight Eastern Standard Time (EST) \no Saturday: Noon – 5pm EST \no Information about GLBT National Hotline from their website: “The Gay, Lesbian, \nBisexual and Transgender (GLBT) National Hotline provides telephone, online \nprivate one-to-one chat and email peer-support, as well as factual information \nand local resources for cities and towns across the United States.” \n \nBENEFITS TO YOUR PARTICIPATION \n \nYou will not experience a direct benefit from completing this questionnaire. As previously stated, \nthis study is intended to explore the experiences of gender nonconforming, transgender, and \ntranssexual individuals as they seek primary care providers. The knowledge gathered from the \ndata will provide another source of insight into the experiences of individuals within these \npopulations with the hopes of improving conditions. \n \nCOSTS \n \nThere are no costs for participating in this study other than the time you will spend completing \nthe questionnaire. \n  \nALTERNATIVES \n \nThere are no alternatives to completing this survey. Your participation in this study is voluntary. \nYou may choose to not participate in this study at any point.  \n  \nCONFIDENTIALITY \n \nYou will not be prompted for and are urged not to disclose any personal or identifiable \ninformation. Any information that could identify you in any way will be stored in a secure \ncomputer database and disregarded in analysis. Every effort will be made to ensure that you will \nremain anonymous and all personal information confidential.  \n \nThe questionnaire will be administered in Virginia Commonwealth University’s REDCap survey \nhost. REDCap ensures the confidentiality of all identifiable information including inadvertent \nidentifiers such as I.P. address and maintains the anonymity of participants.  \n \nVOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL \n \nYou do not have to participate in this study.

    "abstract": "This study explores the experiences of gender nonconforming (GNC), transgender, and transsexual (trans) people in the search for a primary care provider in the United States. The current body of literature on transgender health often discusses HIV rates, substance use, mental health/suicide, and few studies have studies primary care seeking behaviors; this study seeks to provide new insight into the primary care (pcp) seeking behaviors of GNC and trans people. The primary theoretical perspectives utilized in this study were West and Zimmerman’s (1987) “Doing Gender” and the Health Beliefs Mode (Ayers et al., 2007; Connor and Norman, 2005; Green and Murphy, 2014). In order to explore the pcp seeking behaviors among GNC and trans individuals, I designed a 45 item survey.  The survey was posted on-line on three separate “sub-reddits” between March and April of 2016 and was open to all individuals who self-identified as gender nonconforming, transgender, and/or transsexual. Of 96 responses, 68 were included. Although the sample is small, the results showed that structural barriers were significantly associated with having a PCP.  Those with health insurance (p=.031) and those with at least one chronic illness (p=.037) were more likely to have a regular primary care provider. Descriptive findings support the role of socio-economic factors, geographic location, and past experiences of discrimination as predictors of primary care status",
