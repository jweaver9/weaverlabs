Through work, a lesbian woman’s identity has to be negotiated as private lives andpublic lives can overlap. For lesbian women, work and identity intersect, providing a coherent senseof accomplishment. Research has shown that lesbian women are aware of the attitudes that prevailabout lesbian women in the health care environment as they encounter them in their working lives:homophobia; lack of social support and understanding leading to non-disclosure of their own sexuality.Lesbian nurses work within the institution of medicine that reflects societal heterosexual norms.

It provides an individual with a sense of who they arein society, through their membership of communities (Morgan 1999). Throughwork, a lesbian woman’s identity has to be negotiated (Markowe 1996) as privatelives and public lives can overlap. Clunis et al. (2005) suggest that for lesbian women, workand identity overlap, so providing a coherent sense of accomplishment. However, for somelesbian nurses, work is fraught with the unknown as to whether to hide one’s sexuality, orreveal it for Others to see. This paper presents three lesbian women’s experiences of beinga nurse in Irish health care from a hermeneutical phenomenological perspective. A descriptionof the theoretical andmethodological approach adopted for this study is provided. Implicationsfor policy are also discussed.Being Oneself in the Workplace‘In order to get any truth about myself, I must have contact with another person. Theother is indispensable to my own existence, as well as to my knowledge about myself’(Sartre 1985 p. 37-38).The International Journal of Diversity in Organisations, Communities and NationsVolume 10, Number 3, 2010, http://www.Diversity-Journal.com, ISSN 1447-9532© Common Ground, Mel Duffy, All Rights Reserved, Permissions:cg-support@commongroundpublishing.comSartre’s (1985) philosophy suggests that to know oneself or to know the truth of oneself isto know oneself through the eye of the Other. I cannot become on my own, in isolation; Ican only become when I interact with Others and understand their reactions towards me. Igive meaning to these interactions based upon my knowledge of who I am or rather who Ithink I am and what Others think I am. Through this I get a sense of self. As Sartre (1985)indicates, an individual can only know her/himself through the intervention of the Other.Work is an area which represents an important part of people’s lives where they encounterthe Other. For lesbian women identities are likened to work, as it enables them to interactwithin society as workers, consumers and citizens.Work plays a major part in the experiencesof people, giving them a sense of self, value and achievement. It is through work that wemeet the Other and obtain a sense of who we are through the eye of the Other. By way ofwork the possibility of my becoming is open to me, through both my occupation and inter-actions with Others. As Markowe (1996) suggests, in relation to lesbian women ‘comingout at work, type of job and work environment are pertinent’ (p. 7). When a lesbian womancomes out at work, she needs to consider the environmental and social context in which thistakes place, as they do not all value diversity.Lesbian Nurses: An Overview of the LiteratureA few studies have dealt with lesbian women’s experiences of being nurses in the healthcare system (Giddings & Smith 2001), or with their contribution to nursing care (White2002). Giddings & Smith’s (2001) study suggests that lesbian nurses do not ‘come out’ atwork, as they are aware that the nursing environment can be homophobic.“Jane is not out to her patients and considers hospitals an unsafe place for personswho want to be open about their sexuality” (Giddings & Smith 2001 p. 15).Another respondent informed them that she chooses when and where to disclose her sexuality.“Maggie chooses when to be ‘out’ in her job because she is aware that ‘society andequally the health care environment, especially nursing, is homophobic’” (Giddings& Smith 2001 p. 16).However, lesbianism is visible in the nursing work environment through jokes, stereotypesand gossip, invisibility exists through either self-imposed or socially-imposed closeting(Giddings & Smith 2001). This may be explained from the viewpoint that ‘[F]ew lesbiansare able to escape the social stigma of having a sexual identity at odds with current mainstreamcultural values’ (Beals & Peplau 2005 p. 146). Closeted lesbian nurses can collude withother health care professionals through participating in rituals that lead to stereotyping inorder to keep their secret, thus conforming to the expectations of the dominant group, andthereby avoiding stigmatisation because of their lesbian identity. While they are avoidingovert discrimination by collusion, they are experiencing direct discrimination by being forcedto remain closeted.For lesbian nurses to ‘come out’ in the work environment requires basic trust, namely,trust in:232THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIVERSITY IN ORGANISATIONS,COMMUNITIES AND NATIONS“one’s world and especially the persons who are its interpreters is crucial to one’ssense of identity. It is for such reasons as these that shame may be said to go deeperthan guilt; it is worse to be inferior and isolated than to be wrong, to be outcast in one’sown eyes than to be condemned by society” (Lynd 1958 p. 207).Through the internalisation of society’s fears and anxieties about lesbianism, the lesbianwomanmay succumb to a feeling of shame, as Sartre (1969) puts it, ‘I am ashamed of myselfas I appear to the Other’ (p. 222). Shame is internalised and can be dealt with by the self;guilt on the other hand can be sanctioned by society and penalised. Guilt finishes as it is theprice paid for wrongdoing. In contrast, shame can arise out of an ‘if-others-knew’ syndrome,that is, ‘we always imagine and in imagining share the judgments of the other mind’ (Cooley1968 p. 90). Through gossip and jokes the imagined judgments of the ‘other mind’ becomea reality for lesbian nurses.Lesbian nurses are aware that they lack the social support and understanding from theirwork colleagues, which is necessary for the maintenance of self-esteem (Beals & Peplau2005). It has been suggested that, ‘identification with the majority culture does not precludeidentification with the minority culture, and vice versa’ (Fingerhut, Peplau &Ghavami 2005p. 130). Therefore, one may act in a social situation in a way that leads to the best outcomefor the individual. By presenting oneself as an acceptable member of the majority culture,the lesbian woman is risking the outcome of a disclosure. If a lesbian nurse carries out herperformances in work effectively, other nurses will not question her validity. But throughthe stereotypes, jokes and gossip the lesbian nurse faces ‘unwilling acceptance of her [him]selfby individuals who are prejudiced against persons of the kind s/[he] can be revealed to be’(Goffman 1963 p. 58). Therefore the lesbian nurse tends to remain closeted and silent.Shelby (1999) suggests that lesbian nurses should ‘come out’, arguing that while disclosurecan be fraught, and the health benefits are greater. Equally, she indicates that if ‘reputable’nurses ‘come out’, this would lead to other nurses questioning their biases. This however,is problematic: who decides who is ‘reputable’? Moreover, there is no evidence that peoplequestion their biases based on new information (Harrison 2001). Most lesbians have had alifetime experience of passing as heterosexuals, beginning from themoment they recognisedtheir sexuality. However, this has been described as lesbians living a ‘dual-identity’, parti-cipating both in heterosexual and lesbian worlds (Fingerhut, Peplau &Ghavami 2005). Dual-identity can be perceived as living “two lives”, one that derives out of economic necessity,and the other in which lesbian women are socially connected with other lesbian women orothers who affirm lesbian women’s existence.Theoretical FrameworkThe hermeneutical or interpretative phenomenological perspective was chosen as theframework for this study as it ‘fits’ with the aim to explore the lived experience of lesbianwomen as nurses in health care. Whilst a total of seven women were recruited for the study,in this paper insights from three women are presented on their experiences of being nursesin the health care environment.The philosophy of both Heidegger (1962) and Sartre (1969), underpins this study.Heidegger’s (1962) concern with being in the world, offers a theoretical framework wherebylesbian women can be seen as active participants in the world, creating understanding and233MEL DUFFYmeaning to their existence. The essence of Heidegger’s phenomenology is ‘Dasein’ whichhe refers to as the human being in the world: ‘The ‘essence’ of Dasein lies in its existence’(Heidegger 1962 p. 67). Johnson (2000) suggests that Heidegger views the human being as‘always involved in the practical world of experience’ (p. 136). As Heidegger (1962 p. 86)indicates ‘Being-in-the-world is a basic state of Dasein’. Being-in-the-world of health carefor lesbian women as nurses is to know that world both as health care professionals and aslesbian women. They are aware of the attitudes to lesbian women that prevail in the healthcare environment, as they encounter them in their working lives: homophobia (Giddings &Smith 2001); lack of social support and understanding (Fingerhut, Peplau &Ghavami 2005)leading to non-disclosure of their own sexuality (Beals & Peplau 2005), due to the covertor overt discrimination in the workplace.Sartre (1969) offers us a lens through which we can examine how lesbian women experi-ence the self as nurses. Sartre was interested in the question of subjectivity, suggesting thatit was free, not constrained by religion or any other controlling factors, as an individual isnot a means to an end, but an end itself. The individual must create her/himself. In particularI wanted to know how lesbian women remain lesbian within health care environment. It isthis capturing of life as it is lived, that frames the articulation of understanding andmeaningsthat lesbian women derive from the situations they find themselves in.MethodologyThis paper seeks to answer the question ‘What is it like being a lesbian nurse in the healthcare environment?’ Following ethical approval fromDublin City University Ethics Committeean advertisement to obtain a sample of lesbian nurses was placed on the National Councilfor the Professional Development of Nurses andMidwifery (NCNM)website inMarch 2006.The advertisement was also placed in the NCNM magazine edition in June 2006. Every re-gistered nurse in Ireland receives the magazine. Data gathering took place between May2006 and April 2007.The techniques chosen for the purpose of data collection were that of ‘insider’ researcherby stating in the advertisement that I was a lesbian researcher and unstructured informal in-terviews. Initially in the data gathering process I wondered how much of myself I shouldgive, however, it is the nature of research to give of the self (Letherby 2003). The interviewprocess is a social interaction situation, and the more open I became about my own identitythe more relaxed and forthcoming the participants became. ‘It is in the co-disclosure of theshared world that issues of voice, reflexivity, identity, and understanding reveal themselves’(Kavanagh 2006 p. 252).During the initial enquiry from potential participants we spoke about what my study wasabout and what I would like them to talk about. In this way they could think and reflect ontheir experiences in their own time and space, prior to the interview. The interview consistedof one question which invited the participant to reflect on her experience of health care, asa member of the nursing profession. The analysis of the data was guided by Heidegger’s(1993) concept of dwelling, listening to the voices of lesbian women, moving forward inparts and taking refuge in other parts. Through writing and re-writing an interpretive textemerged.Three voices of lesbian nurses are heard in this paper as they spoke about being lesbianin the workplace. These women were aged between 23 and 50 years. To disguise the identity234THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIVERSITY IN ORGANISATIONS,COMMUNITIES AND NATIONSof participants, pseudonyms of old Celtic Irish origin were used and are known as Finnsech,Grian and Saoirse.Limitations of the StudyHermeneutic phenomenology claims, meanings and understanding of everyday life ‘arebound by context’ (Esterfan, McAllister & Rowe 2004 p.36). The findings of this study,conducted in Ireland, in 2006 with a small number of participants are not necessarily gener-alisable to other population groups. VanManen (2002 p. 7) suggests hermeneutic phenomen-ology writing does ‘not yield absolute truths, or objective observations’ rather, ‘at best gainsan occasional glimpse of the meaning of human experience’. A phenomenological study isalways ‘one interpretation’ which is presented here, that is my interpretation of the experiencesof lesbian women.FindingsThis section analyses the themes that emerged from the interviews with lesbian nurses. Thedominant theme is ‘being different’ in the workplace. Under the heading of diversity, theHealth Service Executive staff handbook for all employees recognises that diversity insexual orientation exists in society, and will be represented in their employees.This section will explore whether those who are different are recognised in practice, andis divided into four parts: the first deals with the experience of being different in the Irishworkplace; the second reviews break-time experience; the third explores the issues of theheterosexual dialogue; and finally, the fourth uncovers the mechanisms uses to negotiate theheterosexual dialogue.Being Different – the Irish ExperienceAs providers of health care it is through the eye of the Other that lesbian women in theircapacity as professional nurses obtain a sense of self. They obtain a sense of not only whothey are, that is, lesbian women but also of what Others, in this case nurses, perceive lesbianwomen to be.I suppose everybody, no matter how tough you are or no matter how self-assured youare, people’s perceptions, especially when you are working with people matters youknow, and how much you let them matter then is up to you. But working in the medicalprofession and certainly working within a very female-dominated profession leads toa wide variety of perceptions thrown in your direction (Finnsech).Finnsech is aware that how people see her matters, she is not an island but interacts withOthers. She suggests that individuals take onto themselves the perceptions of Others tovarying degrees implying it is up to the individual to decide to what extent the opinions ofOthers replicates the self and their actions. This mirrors Goffman’s (1963) assertions wherebyFinnsech must ‘face unwilling acceptance’ of herself ‘by individuals who are prejudicedagainst persons’ (p. 28) who are like her, that is, lesbian women.235MEL DUFFYWorking in a dominantly female profession such as nursing brings Finnsech’s awarenessof her lesbianism to the fore. She indicates that there are a ‘wide variety of perceptions’about lesbian women amongst the nursing profession.“What does not vary is the necessity for her (him) to exist in the world, to be at workthere, to be there in the midst of other people, and to be mortal there” (Sartre 1985 p.8).Finnsech exists in the world that is populated by Others. She cannot exist on her own sheneeds the Other for her existence to be apparent. Through her existence Finnsech is awareof her lesbian identity in everyday situations; however through her work as a nurse heridentity can come to the forefront. Due to this she is aware of the perceptions of her colleaguestowards lesbian women.Break-time ChatterFinnsech’s coming out at work was not intentional or planned. Rather, she found herself ina place where she did not want to be other than herself.A specific incidence I remember was we had been on a set of nights with a group thatI, with about 4 of us that I had worked with for about 6 months so, I wasn’t out at thispoint to these particular colleagues and we had done a weeks nights and everything isvery laid back and personal when you’re working nights over Christmas, people talkabout their families, where they’d rather be you know and you spend, your longerbreaks, you spend a lot more time sort of discussing your personal lives (Finnsech).Finnsech reveals that Christmas time at work leads to different conversations and moresharing of personal lives amongst nursing colleagues. Although predominantly a Christianreligious ritual, Christmas in Irish culture through the dominant position of the CatholicChurch epitomises the family. It reinforces the norms and values of the heterosexual familyrecognising no other family structures. It underpins what Tovey & Share (2000) indicatesas the importance of ‘religion in the shaping of our contemporary society, its continuingrelevance in terms of everyday social life’ (p. 306). The relevance of Christmas for Irishsociety is that it is one of many rituals that is seen as traditionally focusing on the heterosexualfamily as the primary unit of society. Nassbaum (1997) succinctly states: ‘society shapesnot only tradition, but also the experience of people who grow up in it’ (p. 229). TheChristmas period in Ireland is traditionally a time for families whether or not an individualparticipates in the religious ritual. Finnsech experienced more exchanges being initiatedaround family.Heterosexual DialogueFinnsech experienced Christmas, as the time when private and public lives collided throughtalk between colleagues other lesbian nurses perceive this as being part and parcel of normalevery day talk amongst nurses.236THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIVERSITY IN ORGANISATIONS,COMMUNITIES AND NATIONSI find it very hard at break-times, all we seem to talk about are weddings and engage-ments, babies and what schools to send your children to and I just find its very draininglistening to it all the time (Saoirse).Another participant put this in an alternative way.I was kind of looking at how you know social aspect in work and I suppose you haveto sit down, you have to listen to I mean the young ones are all getting married and allabout their dresses and all about for half the night and photographs and then the womenand men my age then would be with their children and their photographs and then theolder ones would be about their extensions as well but it does get a bit boring I meansome people who ask me oh are you going out with anybody (Grian).Grian and Saoirse experience their difference on an ongoing base through day-to-day con-versations. Saoirse faces social conversations in her workplace as being ‘very hard’ and‘draining’ as she is listening to discussions she cannot participate in. She is socially isolatedfrom her peers, as she does not fit into the rituals of the heterosexual norm that is engagements,weddings, babies, children and schools. These are the tools as Saoirse experiences it of theheterosexual dialogue. Her lived reality does not include these rituals on a personal level.She expresses this in the following manner:I feel very different to the other nurses … don’t have a lot in common with the othernurses (Saoirse).Heidegger (1969) suggests ‘this thing that is called differences, we encounter it everywhere’(p. 63). Saoirse experiences her differences on a daily basis in the workplace. Her presentsituation does not include the reality of family life that is portrayed to her from her colleaguesas the heterosexual norm. There is no recognition of same-sex family structures in Irish so-ciety. While lesbian women are having children, and some have children from being previ-ously married, they are creating their own family structures; but this is not part of Saoirse’sreality. She feels different to her colleagues, encapsulating this by stating that she does not‘have a lot in common with the other nurses’. She views her colleagues as being Othersthrough which she can judge herself but more importantly be judged (Sartre 1969). Shecannot participate fully in the day-to-day exchanges that happen between colleagues at breaktime. However her difference is exposed for her to see and while her colleagues may notknow this Saoirse does. In Sartrean terms it is through the Other that she knows herself.Grian on the other hand views talk amongst nurses at break-time as a chore in that shestates ‘you have to’ both ‘sit down’ and ‘listen’ to the stories that are shared at break times.It is almost like a weight on her shoulders or a burden whereby the ‘you have to’ indicatesthat there is no escaping and it is a duty to be performed. As Skidmore (2004) succinctlyputs it:“[F]or many workers a distinguishing feature of the workplace is the regular, if notdaily, contact with a group of co-workers with whom one is obligated to interact” (p.236).237MEL DUFFYAs Grian cannot participate in these exchanges she finds them ‘a bit boring’; in other wordsfor Grian these conversations are tiresome and tedious. They are also repetitive whereby shecan almost predict what the topic at break-times will be.Negotiating the Heterosexual DialogueGrian finds ways around questions about her personal life particularly in relation to marriageand children. She finds her route by not participating in the conversation on the self andturning it back on the questioner.By not talking about yourself and asking, I suppose asking them questions, and theyare talking about themselves then (Grian).She removes the focus from herself and orientates the Other towards themselves throughasking them questions about the self. In this way she negotiates the presentation of the selfin front of the heterosexual norm. Grain puts distance between herself and Others by placingthe spotlight on the Other and removing it from herself. She not only successfully distancesherself from the Other but from the assigned categories that make up heterosexuality. In thisway she successfully keeps her lesbianism hidden. Grian reflectsI’m a listener more than a talker (Grian).She positions herself favourably for the Other as being a listener. In this way she does nothave to interact on a personal level with her colleagues. She successfully deflects any queriesabout herself and becomes the ear for Others to talk about themselves. By being a listenerGrian regulates information about the self.Grian’s actions could be interpreted from a Sartrean point of view as the hiding of theself.“My possibility of hiding in the corner becomes the fact that the Other can surpass ittoward his possibility of pulling me out of concealment, of identifying me, of arrestingme” (Sartre 1969 p. 264).Grian’s hiding in the corner is the act of turning the conversation away from herself to theOther. The act of listening prevents her discovery and the ability of the Other to see her asa lesbian woman. Equally she does not become ‘this self that the other knows’ (Sartre 1969p. 261). As she does not disclose herself there is no opportunity for the Other to know her.Grian’s concealment remains. This adequately illustrates Draucker’s (1999) point when hestates that individuals participate in acts of ‘everyday skilful coping’ (p. 361). Those are theskills for everyday living which enable an individual to participate in the situations in whichthey find themselves. One of the skills that Grian has developed for everyday living in hercapacity as a nurse, which enables her to exist within the nursing community is that oflistener. By becoming a listener she does not have to participate by divulging the self, shecan remain ‘hidden from the Other’ (Sartre 1969 p. 49) but is perceived as participating inthe conversation. Grian, however, does participate in the conversation through asking ques-tions of the Other and listening. This is different for Saoirse as she indicates that she doesnot take part because she lacks commonality with her colleagues. For her there is nothingto discuss and the possibility of her becoming through interaction with Others is limited.238THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIVERSITY IN ORGANISATIONS,COMMUNITIES AND NATIONSHowever Grian’s possibility of becoming is equally limited through her interactions or lackof interaction with the Other.Summary of FindingsBeing oneself for lesbian nurses working in an Irish health care setting is a troublesome affair.Lesbian nurses in this study employed mechanisms to hide their sexuality, such as being alistener. These lesbian nurses, remained in the closet. The experience of being different forsome lesbian nurses was heightened through the heteronormativity of conversations amongstnurses.Implications for the WorkplaceTheHSE recognises through itsEmployeeHandbook diversity in sexual orientation. However,the findings of this study would suggest that they need to develop and implement trainingfor all health care professionals to create a working policy (www.hse.ie). In Ireland, theNational Council for the Professional Development of Nursing andMidwifery (NCNM)wasset up in 1999, with the mission to develop the nursing and midwifery profession wherebythe profession could delivery nursing care in a changing health care environment.The NCNM are the nursing body in Ireland that can issues guidelines for best nursingpractice. However, through the promotion of quality of health care, the NCNM needs to re-cognise and develop guidelines on lesbian health care. While this plan was developed priorto the establishment of the HSE, it is the responsibility of the HSE to ensure that both awoman-friendly health care, and sensitivity training programmes are established, for allhealth care professionals. To date, neither the HSE nor the NCNM have developed bestpractice guideline for the care of lesbian patients. While the HSE recognises the existenceof sexual diversity amongst health care professionals, it needs to create a working policy.ConclusionBeingmembers of the nursing profession themajority of the participants faced their differenceon day-to-day bases revealing a profession that did not acknowledge diversity amongst itsmembers. However it is pertinent to keep in mind Skidmore’s (2004) observation that whenwe review the experiences of lesbian women of the workplace the ‘contours of the hetero-normative workplace are thrown into somewhat sharper relief than would otherwise be thecase’ (p.233). In other words lesbian women as nurses practice in a cultural environmentwhereby the norms, values and belief systems of nursing are based upon heterosexuality.This paper aimed to explore the meanings and understanding that lesbian women generateworking in a health care environment as nurses. It gives meaning and understanding to theexperiences that lesbian women provide as nurses, within the health care environment.AcknowledgementsThis study was part-funded by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social SciencePostgraduate Scholarship 2006-2007.239MEL DUFFYReferencesBeals, Kristin P. & Peplau, Letitia Anne (2005) Identity Support, Identity Devaluation, andWell-BeingAmong Lesbians.

    "abstract": "Work is an area which represents an important part of people’s lives where they encounter\n\nthe Other. It provides an individual with a sense of who they are in society, through their membership\n\nof communities. Through work, a lesbian woman’s identity has to be negotiated as private lives and\n\npublic lives can overlap. For lesbian women, work and identity intersect, providing a coherent sense\n\nof accomplishment. Research has shown that lesbian women are aware of the attitudes that prevail\n\nabout lesbian women in the health care environment as they encounter them in their working lives:\n\nhomophobia; lack of social support and understanding leading to non-disclosure of their own sexuality.\n\nLesbian nurses work within the institution of medicine that reflects societal heterosexual norms. The\n\nmethodology derived from the qualitative tradition employing hermeneutic phenomenology. It presents\n\nan original conceptualisation and consistent application of theoretical frameworks of Heidegger and\n\nSartre. Interviews were conducted between March 2006 and April 2007 with seven lesbian nurses.\n\nLesbian nurses in Ireland remain in the “closet” leading some lesbian nurses to experience social\n\nisolation. This paper argues that being oneself is difficult for lesbian nurses who work in the heteronormative\n\nculture of Irish hospitals",
