Women, children, gender minorities, and people of color are often the hardest hit. And while women in poverty experience the same issues that all people in poverty experience—income inequality, unemployment, poor health, violence, trauma, and more—the odds are often uniquely stacked against them in gendered ways. There are 6.5 million women1 and an estimated 50,000 trans2 people living in Illinois. They are a driving force in our economy and care for our children, sick, and elderly, and yet continue to face discrimination and inequitable opportunities. This year’s annual report on poverty in Illinois shows how gender, gender identity, and gender norms shape experiences of poverty for women and gender minorities—and how women who have other marginalized identities experience even more inequity. If we want to dramatically reduce poverty, improving the well-being of women—particularly women of color—would deliver the biggest return. Gender discrimination harms people who exist outside of the traditional gender binary. In 2015, 21% of trans Illinoisans lived in poverty,3 compared to 13.6% of Illinoisans overall.4 Employment discrimination and harassment are rampant, resulting in disparate economic outcomes for many trans Illinoisans.5 And crisis levels of violence against trans people, especially trans women of color, erodes their core human rights, threatens their lives, and exposes them to trauma.6   The damage from intersecting oppressions is profound: systemic sexism, racism, transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia, ableism, worker exploitation, mass incarceration, and gender violence work together to set back women and gender minorities. And these systemic forces have marginalized people across generations, deepening inter-generational gaps in poverty, wealth, and other outcomes. Economic disparities beget inequities in health, nutrition, housing, and more. In order to address the gender poverty and wealth gap, our solutions must also tackle inequities for people of color, immigrants, low-wage workers, LGBTQ people, and others.In some ways, women today are achieving parity with men at historic levels: women are achieving higher levels of education than men; Congress has record numbers of woman legislators; and Chicago is on the cusp of electing its first black woman mayor —the largest American city to do so. This progress makes the deep, entrenched disparities highlighted in this report stand out even more starkly. With women taking unprecedented leadership in government, business, and other sectors, we are at a unique moment in time to tackle the root causes of the issues that continue to keep women and gender minorities at a persistent disadvantage.Heartland Alliance  3THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEEXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  THE INTERSECTION OF GENDER AND POVERTY Women still lag behind men on pay and poverty—and equal pay would make a huge dent in this inequity. In Illinois, women still earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men for full-time, year-round work, and this gap hasn’t budged since 2011.7 If we do nothing, women in Illinois will not see equal pay until 2065.8   But if we do only one thing—eliminate the gender wage gap—working women’s poverty rates would be more than halved. That would translate into a 16% increase in women’s earnings, totaling $20.5 billion—a huge boost for Illinois’s economy. It means 1.1 million children would benefit from equal pay, reducing the poverty rate for children with working mothers by 43%.9 Poverty rates for working women in Illinois would be halved if women had equal pay.8.3%4.0%Heartland Alliance  4THE GENDER DISADVANTAGE Women and gender minorities have complex, overlapping experiences of poverty based on their many identities. These identities are not static: people may travel in and out of them over the course of their lives.Women of color fare worse than white women on almost every domain: they’re paid less, have less wealth, are more likely to be low-wage workers in jobs that lack key benefits, have poorer health outcomes, higher incarceration rates, experience domestic violence, and have worse economic outcomes when experiencing disability.Single mothers are deeply and uniquely impacted by poverty. They experience significant economic shocks after childbirth that linger throughout their lifetime, are pushed into poverty by child care costs, and are harshly penalized by the safety net. Gender disparities in job quality and workplace conditions are significant. Women experience high rates of wage inequities and wage violations, and make up a larger percentage of the workforce in sectors that lack key benefits and make it difficult to balance caretaking and work. Immigrant women are at high risk of workplace exploitation. Even though women have better education outcomes and lower unemployment rates than men, they are still more likely to live in poverty, raising concerns about job quality.Workplace discrimination and harassment are key drivers of economic gender inequities. Women experience higher rates of discrimination and harassment on the job than men, and gender non-conforming people face higher rates of employment discrimination and harassment than cisgender people. The unequal distribution of unpaid care seeds many other disparities. Women spend significantly more time on unpaid care work than men. While this care labor is crucially important on a household and societal level, it is most often not compensated and makes it harder for women to engage in the labor force, pursue educational opportunities, or be more visible in public life. It also means that caregivers lack the important benefits that come with work, such as paid time off, retirement savings, access to the Earned Income Tax Credit, and more.Poor health and poverty are a vicious cycle for women—and the policy infrastructure that supports women’s health is under attack. Trauma puts women at risk of experiences that could further traumatize them—incarceration, domestic violence, homelessness, and trafficking. Continued re-traumatization makes it hard to move out of poverty. Gender discrimination and disparity extends beyond the gender binary. Gender non-conforming people experience high rates of poverty, poor physical and mental health, workplace discrimination, violent victimization, sexual assault, homelessness, and trafficking.Social norms and policy infrastructure conspire to reinforce gender disparities. Gender norms color everything from a person’s own perception of themselves and their opportunities, to how they are treated by other people, to how public policy and business practices treat people based on their gender.1234568910710 KEY FINDINGS: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  THE INTERSECTION OF GENDER AND POVERTY GUIDE TO THE REPORT This report is intended to show the breadth of poverty experiences for women and gender minorities, and allow readers to dig deeper into the issues relevant to them. We begin with a visual overview of Illinois gender inequity by the numbers. While we use Illinois data where we can, limitations on the availability of public data and research at the state level—especially disaggregated by gender—led us to present national data for some issues that strongly impact women’s well-being, but do not have local data available.Next, we delve into the drivers of gender inequity—ranging from gender norms and misogyny to structural policies and practices. Wondering where to go from here? We recommend systemic changes that would advance gender equity. Finally, we present a series of snapshots of the different ways poverty impacts women and gender minorities.  If you’re looking for a fuller understanding of the issue, we encourage you to read the report front to back. But if you’re pressed for time, the report is designed to make it easy for you to access just what you need.

Misogyny permeates attitudes, ultimately influencing policy, business, and personal behavior, and results in inequitable outcomes for women, ranging from higher poverty rates to lower pay and wealth to sexual harassment and assault. Social scripts and expectations about what women and men should do and how they should act—that is, gender norms—are an underlying force behind the inequities we see in this report. Gender norms—such as a woman’s place being in the home, the default role of woman as caretaker, and stigma against women taking certain jobs—are remarkably consistent across cultures.23  These trends hold true in the U.S., where women spend disproportionate time on unpaid care work and are underrepresented in traditionally male (and higher-paying) professions and roles, as well as in elected office. Without a critical mass, women seeking to defy gender norms may be punished socially or in the workplace, ultimately reinforcing gender norms.24 In young adolescence—a period conceptualized as a “gender intensification period”—boys and girls face increasing pressure to conform to gender norms. Teens absorb these roles from all sides, whether through their parents’ behavior and expectations, messages received from school and peer dynamics, portrayals of acceptable male and female behavior in popular media, or observation of gender representation in various professions. At this young, impressionable age, gender roles shape the choices people make—whether to take advanced math, where to apply for college, declaring their aspirations for a future career. For example:• Gender norms can discourage girls from pursuing STEM education.25 • Trans youth face bullying related to their transgression of gender norms at school, resulting in missing many days of school, feeling unsafe in the classroom, and psychological distress.26 • Gender norms can also perpetuate intimate partner violence, with feminine norms of passivity and dependence and masculine norms of aggression and dominance putting women at risk of abuse.27  • Women of color face oppressive social scripts about how they should act and behave not only regarding their gender, but regarding their race as well.28  For example, the stereotype of the “angry black woman” can result in harsher disciplinary actions towards black girls in school. DRIVERS OF  GENDER INEQUITY  Heartland Alliance  10THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEWORKPLACE HARASSMENTDespite advances in the workplace, harassment and discrimination still impact how women are treated in the hiring process, how they advance in their careers, and how they are compensated. During the hiring process, women compete for lower-paying jobs.29  A significant body of evidence shows that female applicants are often passed over when applying for “male” jobs, and face stereotypes from hiring managers that could hurt applications for high-status positions.30  Once women do get hired, over half of U.S. women report experiencing some sort of behavioral mistreatment in the workplace.31  Trans people also report extremely high rates of workplace harassment.32 Women face the risk of retaliation for reporting harassment and assault in the workplace. More than two-thirds of workers who filed sexual harassment complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) between 2012 and 2016 say they experienced retaliation, from losing their job to transfers to losing support at work. Almost all of the people in that group ended up leaving their jobs because conditions were unbearable. Workplace cultures can label the person who reported as difficult or over-sensitive, harming their professional reputation. Between 2017 and 2018, sexual harassment complaints to EEOC rose almost 14% and complaints of retaliation increased 5%. And less than one in four workers who file harassment complaints received monetary compensation, often under $10,000.33 Changing the culture of sexual harassment and gender inequity in the workplace is incredibly difficult when employees are punished for using the tools at their disposal for recourse. Not surprisingly, only a small fraction of the over half of women who experience workplace harassment report it.34 WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATIONWorkplace discrimination is a factor in the gender wage gap. Even controlling for measurable qualifications, women still earn less than men.35  Women-dominated professions have lower median earnings than men-dominated professions, and gender-based pay disparities are highest within the highest-paying occupations.36 Men earn more than women, even in woman-dominated professions like nursing.37 And while women in the U.S. working full-time, year-round earn 81 cents for every dollar a similarly employed man makes, this understates the extent of the gender wage gap by looking only at income at a point in time. Looking over a long span of a worker’s career—15 years—women earned just 49 cents for every dollar a man earned. Women are more likely to temporarily leave the workplace than men and are significantly penalized for doing so.38 At every step along the way, employment discrimination poses barriers to work for women and contributes to unequal pay.Gender norms color everything from a person’s own perception of themselves and their opportunities, to how they are treated by other people, to how public policy and business practices treat people based on their gender. Given the pervasiveness of gender norms and how they shape life outcomes, interventions that aim to end gender inequities without taking into account the difficult work of changing gender norms are likely to come up short.39 DRIVERS OF GENDER INEQUITY  Heartland Alliance  11THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEHOW POLICIES AND PRACTICES CONTRIBUTE TO GENDER DISPARITIESThe snapshots that follow are not intended to be an exhaustive list of systems that marginalize women and gender non-conforming people, but simply to demonstrate how laws, social norms, and private sector behavior work together to reinforce gender poverty disparities. UNPAID CARE WORK AND THE DEFINITION OF WORKAs a society, we have made decisions about who counts as a worker and who doesn’t. Important benefits follow worker status—such as labor protections and rights, tax credits, and unemployment insurance. Some of those who fall outside of this worker status enshrined in our laws and regulations still conduct socially valuable labor and yet lack compensation, protection, and benefits. Outside of the paid workplace, there are significant inequities in the distribution of unpaid care labor between men and women. Women spend 1.6x more time on household activities than men, and 1.9x more time on caring for household members than men.40 While this care labor is crucially important on a household and societal level, it is most often not compensated and makes it harder for women to engage in the labor force, pursue educational opportunities, or be more visible in public life. It also means that caregivers lack the important benefits that come with work, such as paid time off, retirement savings, access to the Earned Income Tax Credit, and more. In Illinois, family caregivers provided an estimated $18.5 million of caregiving labor to adults with disabilities in 2013.41  The UN identified gender inequities in unpaid care work as a barrier to fulfillment of women’s human rights, particularly for women living in poverty.42  REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMReproductive freedom is closely tied to women’s economic security. Research finds that increasing women’s ability to plan their families increases the likelihood of attending and completing college, workforce participation, economic stability, and outcomes for children.43  And rates of unintended pregnancy are more than five times higher for women in poverty than high-income women.44 Women who are denied abortions are more likely to be in poverty, less likely to be employed full time, and are more likely to be on public assistance than women who can access abortions.45  Publicly funded family planning services play a major role in helping women, especially low-income women, avoid pregnancies they did not want or plan for. Without these services, the unintended pregnancy rate in the U.S. would have been 68 percent higher.46 Protecting and expanding reproductive rights improves economic and health outcomes for women. Unfortunately, these rights are seriously threatened by federal and state policy agendas.47  FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE Family leave is rarely paid and infrequently taken in the United States, posing barriers to both caretaking and employment. Only 1 in 7 U.S. civilian workers had paid family leave benefits in 2016,48 and only half of first-time mothers are able to take paid family leave.49 Inadequate family leave can push families into poverty, harm women’s attachment to the labor force, and produce worse outcomes for children. The economic stability of families declines in the months before and after a birth, especially among less-educated parents and single mothers living alone. On average, family incomes decline by 10 percent from pre-pregnancy to the month of birth. This decline is DRIVERS OF GENDER INEQUITY  Heartland Alliance  12THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEeven steeper for single mothers living alone—42 percent.50 Maternal and child health can suffer with inadequate maternity leave. Low-wage workers, in particular, are disparately impacted by the lack of paid family and medical leave, since they are less likely to have those benefits at their workplace and have fewer financial resources to spend on caretaking, either for their children or for sick family members (see section on low-wage workers for more). Low-income people have disproportionately high caregiving needs for all kinds of family members, not just children, and caregiving often falls to women. CHILD CARE EXPENSESA significant number of families with young children fall into poverty or face barriers to employment due to child care expenses. Roughly a third of families with young children are pushed into poverty by child care expenses, particularly families with three or more children, headed by a single parent, and those with heads of household who are black, Latino, did not graduate high school, or who are not working full-time.51 More than 40 percent of single mothers living in poverty pay for child care; for a third of these mothers, child care costs consume more than half of their income. And child care subsidies are under-utilized; less than one in four eligible children received subsidies, and those who do typically receive them for a short amount of time.52 Low-income families rely on parental child care (26 percent) at a higher rate than middle-income (20 percent) and higher-income families (14 percent).53 Child care is particularly difficult for parents with nonstandard or unpredictable work schedules that may not allow them to plan in advance or work during hours that a child care center is open; indeed, hours outside of a 9 to 5 schedule are the norm, not the exception, in many industries. Half of women who work nonstandard hours rely on family members as the sole form of child care, compared to less than 30 percent of women who work standard hours.54 In the face of high costs and the difficulty of meeting unpredictable child care needs, low-income parents may choose to leave or reduce engagement in the workforce, raising the likelihood of living in poverty.SAFETY NETThe social safety net in the U.S. is often structured in punitive ways, with the stated goal of incentivizing people to work. Research suggests that these punitive measures are more likely to keep people with less social capital in poverty than to push them up the economic ladder.55 Not completing high school increases your likelihood of living in poverty in the U.S. by 16.4 percent, compared to less than 5 percent in other industrialized nations.56 Single mothers in the U.S. have the highest employment rates of single mothers in affluent Western nations, but the highest level of poverty. In other nations, higher job quality and stronger social supports for single mothers (such as guaranteeing a standard of living in the absence of child support) improve their economic security.57 While single motherhood is often a scapegoat for women’s disproportionately high poverty rates, simulations suggest that women’s poverty in the U.S. would still be higher than other wealthy nations even if our single motherhood rate were as low as theirs—suggesting that U.S. social policy is inadequate to keep single mothers out of poverty. One key social support that benefits single mothers and families in poverty is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). TANF is a block grant program that replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children in 1996. With greater state flexibility in implementing TANF, many states have chosen to restrict access to the program. As a result, TANF usage has been steadily declining. In 1995 – 96 in Illinois, there were 87.5 families receiving TANF for every 100 families with children in poverty.58 Today, only 13 families receive TANF for every 100 families with children in poverty.  And the amount of cash assistance is far below what families need to meet their basic human needs or move out of poverty—in Illinois, TANF assistance is just 30% of the poverty line for a family of three (average payment of $520 per month). Illinois increased TANF amounts slightly, DRIVERS OF GENDER INEQUITY  Heartland Alliance  13THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEmarking the first increase in ten years and only the second increase since 1996. Over 95 percent of adult TANF recipients in Illinois are women.59 WEALTH AND RETIREMENT SECURITYWhile the gender divide in income is large, women have even less wealth relative to men. For every dollar of assets a single white man owns, single black women have one cent and single Latina women have less than one cent of assets.60  And despite gains made by women approaching retirement age on education, credit, and employment equity, single women aged 45 – 65 have actually lost substantial amounts of wealth over the past twenty years—particularly black and Latina women in this cohort.61 These wealth gaps are born of generations of systemic discrimination and policies that restricted access to wealth-building mechanisms such as education, employment, homeownership, and credit.The gender wealth divide translates into a gender retirement savings gap. Women are falling behind men on each leg of the “three-legged stool” of retirement savings (pension plans, Social Security, and personal savings). Women are less likely to work in fields that offer pensions, raising the likelihood that they will need to rely upon savings and Social Security to survive in retirement.62 And since women work fewer years, are more likely to work part time, and earn less than men, they have less income to devote to saving and forfeit more Social Security benefits.63 Employment discrimination pushes older women workers to leave the workforce earlier than intended. Older women workers—particularly black and Latina women—are more likely to be involuntarily separated from their jobs than similar white and male workers. Older women workers also have more difficulty finding new jobs after job loss than older male workers, putting them at risk of needing to retire earlier than desired or planned for.64 This retirement savings gap is crucially important: women live longer and have higher healthcare expenses on average than men do, and therefore need to save a higher percentage of their income.65 As a result of these pressures, women are 80 percent more likely than men to live in poverty in retirement.66 IMMIGRATIONThe U.S. immigration system is structured to reinforce gender-specific roles for women and men.  The historical barriers and gender-biased immigration processes in the U.S., coupled with pervasive structural barriers in countries of origin (e.g., lack of access to education and income inequality) reinforce the practice of women relying on men to petition on their behalf. This has ramifications for immigrant women’s ability to work outside the home, assert their daily independence, and their ability to leave an abusive spouse/partner. Department of Justice (DOJ) leadership has upended longstanding case law67 to make it even more difficult for survivors of domestic violence to establish eligibility for asylum.68 These policies and practices—whether driven by legislation, regulation, business practices, or personal interactions—have concrete effects on the daily lives of the different groups of women we’ll explore in the following pages. DRIVERS OF GENDER INEQUITY  Heartland Alliance  14GENDER + POVERTYWomen experience the same issues that we highlight every year in our reports on poverty—income inequality, unemployment, poor health, violence, and more—but often amplified and manifested in gendered ways. This is particularly true when women have other marginalized identities. The forces that result in gender inequities have been in effect for generations, and are woven deeply throughout our policymaking, private business practice, and personal attitudes and behaviors. Far-reaching systemic change, in addition to incremental victories towards equity, is needed in order to eliminate disparities for women and gender minorities.When designing programs and developing policy to address poverty and inequity, impacted people and communities—women, gender minorities, people experiencing poverty, etc.—must have a seat at the table. The most effective solutions will be those informed and led by people with first-hand knowledge of poverty and inequity. At the same time, we should build the capacity of organizations grounded in, and led by, communities of color that are working to advance gender equity and end poverty in their communities.MULTIFACETED POLICY CHANGE IS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCE GENDER INEQUITY. These 10 sets of recommendations reflect what we can do here in Illinois to disrupt the drivers of inequity. 1  Address discrimination head on to increase opportunity and fairnessStrengthen protections against retaliation for workplace harassment claims and increase penalties for employers. This would help change workplace cultures away from tolerating sexual harassment and assault, and better protect workers when harassment and assault does happen.2  Increase income to foster economic security and strength Prohibit employers from asking a prospective employee’s pay history. This would stop a practice that perpetuates gender pay inequities. Employers should also audit staff salaries across functions and gender to understand the scope of current gender pay gaps, set goals to eliminate them, and take action towards doing so.Modernize and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. This would expand participation in the labor market for single mothers69 and provide important cash assistance to people providing valuable, though not traditionally compensated, labor—largely women. Illinois should broaden eligibility up the income chain as well as include low-income caregivers and students, increase the amount to address rising cost of living, and deliver payments periodically throughout the year instead of in one large lump sum. This program does more to end child and family poverty than any other.3  Increase wealth building opportunitiesIncrease pathways to retirement savings. Increasing the amount that women are saving for retirement will go a long way towards reducing poverty rates for older women. A new retirement savings program, Illinois Secure Choice, will help women have more access to employer-based LOOKING FORWARD GENDER + POVERTY Heartland Alliance  15retirement savings accounts. While enormously important, increasing access to retirement savings accounts is only the first step to increasing retirement savings for women. The recommendations to reduce the income and caregiving gaps above will make it easier for women to save more for retirement. Offer matched emergency savings plans at workplaces. This would make it easier for women to avoid dipping into retirement savings or seeking high-cost credit to weather emergencies. 4   Change the structure of work to foster stability and successRequire minimum paid sick time for workers statewide. This would reduce the need for workers to choose between going to work sick (or being left without childcare options for a sick child) and risking their income or job. Paid sick days should be usable for the employee’s own physical or mental health, care for a family member, attending medical appointments, or the need to take off work due to domestic violence. Require fair scheduling by employers. This would especially help low-income women who struggle with finding consistent childcare due to variable schedules. It would also help them plan other appointments, education, or a second job. Stable scheduling helps employers improve worker productivity and increase sales.70 Improve family and medical leave policy. This would enhance employment stability for low-income women, reduce costs for employers by improving employee retention and morale, improve health outcomes for women and their families, and reduce family stress.71 Women are more likely to return to work after childbirth when states have paid leave programs, and the positive effects are strongest for low-income women72—including reducing poverty rates.73  5   Recognize and value the vital role of caregiving for families and  our economyExpand the availability of subsidized childcare and the child and dependent care tax credit. This would make it easier for working mothers to find quality childcare in the absence of informal childcare arrangements and would make it more likely for working mothers to become employed, stay employed, and have high-quality jobs, as well as improve child well-being. Policy should position care work as a social and collective responsibility, rather than an individual one. Women spend a disproportionate number of hours engaging in unpaid care relative to men. This makes it harder for them to pursue educational, civic, and employment opportunities.74  As such, policy should not exclude people from social programs on the basis of paid employment status and should ensure an adequate standard of living for unpaid caregivers. Policies should also support men’s ability to provide caregiving—for example, paid paternity leave—in order to redistribute unpaid care responsibilities among women and men. Investments in quality subsidized childcare, elder care, and disability support can reduce the unpaid care burden as well.6  Ensure health care access, meaningful coverage, and supportExpand and protect Medicaid. Over 760,000 women aged 19 – 64 have public health insurance coverage in Illinois.75 Medicaid helps women meet crucial medical needs, covering nearly half of all births in the U.S. and three-quarters of publicly funded family planning services.76 Medicaid is the largest source of mental health services for low-income women and must be protected. LOOKING FORWARDGENDER + POVERTY Heartland Alliance  16In addition to building on our Medicaid foundation, dedicated funding for enrollment assistance is needed to help increase enrollment in both Affordable Care Act plans and Medicaid, leading to improved health and financial security for Illinois families. Finally, eligibility systems reforms are immediately needed to reduce coverage loss and improve how people across the state get enrolled and stay enrolled in Medicaid. Defend women’s reproductive rights. This is critical to enabling women to fulfill their human rights and achieve economic security. Illinois should continue to protect women’s access to contraception, abortion, and information about sexual health and family planning.Ensuring pre-existing condition protections and maternity benefits are provided in the individual insurance market. The Affordable Care Act prohibited discrimination based on preexisting conditions, including charging women more for coverage. It also established maternity care as a required benefit for all plans. The state should prioritize preventing and reversing the erosion of these protections through regulating low-quality insurance products and working to protect the ACA.Support the health needs of trans people. While it is illegal in Illinois to deny health insurance to people on the basis of gender identity, many insurance providers do not cover treatment related to gender transition. Medicaid in Illinois expressly prohibits coverage of transition-related medical procedures.77 This prohibition should be removed so that low-income trans Illinoisans can meet their health and medical needs.7   Provide meaningful, responsive supports for lower-income women to build uponStrengthen Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). TANF provides income supports to children and families with limited or no income, meaning they must make TANF stretch far to cover basic needs. The amount needs to be increased in Illinois. In addition, TANF has a Family Violence Exclusion that makes it easier for survivors of domestic and family violence to access TANF benefits; this exclusion needs to be implemented consistently and expanded to other public benefits programs.Tailor SNAP outreach to increase food security. This would particularly benefit groups of women who are currently under-enrolled, including women in college, elderly women, immigrant women, women experiencing homelessness, and women exiting prison. Targeting outreach strategies and program design to the needs of these communities—for example, by implementing a restaurant meals program, streamlining application procedures, and enrolling people in SNAP before they leave institutions—would do much to reduce food insecurity for low-income women. Increase Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program uptake and retention. This would improve food access and health outcomes for mothers and young children. Illinois should streamline eligibility determinations through the use of adjunctive eligibility; increase flexibility in the use of WIC food benefits; increase support for breastfeeding mothers; collaborate with existing early childhood programs; and invest in the health, quality, and consistency of program administration.Increase resources for affordable housing. This would significantly improve the financial stability of the 37% of single female-headed households in Illinois who pay more than half of their income towards rent. While the federal government provides a significant proportion of affordable housing resources, it is essential that the state also commit to addressing the affordable housing crisis faced by Illinois families. Housing is a jumping off point for safety and stability, and opens the doors to opportunity in many ways.LOOKING FORWARDHeartland Alliance  17GENDER + POVERTY8   Prevent and respond to violence to create a culture of safety  and well-beingStrengthen and grow trauma-informed mental health and violence prevention and intervention programs. These are needed to support victims of gender-based violence, including intimate partner violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and other traumatic experiences. Women and gender minorities who have experienced trauma need services that understand the effects of trauma and help them heal so that they can break the cycle of poverty and trauma.78 Our public systems must provide high quality mental health services and targeted programs to address traumatic experiences so that women have the tools and support to overcome these challenges. Support flexible and responsive intimate partner violence services. This includes support for childcare, credit and asset building, housing, education, food, employment, and cash assistance. Survivors have a diverse range of needs when they are looking to heal from intimate partner violence,79 especially when they experience other inequities due to poverty, race, ability, and more.80  Time limits on services harm survivors’ ability to recover and should be removed. Service providers need the flexibility to be innovative and nimble in meeting survivors’ needs. Further, equitable access to services for survivors of domestic violence must be expanded. Research shows that communities of color and low-income communities experience high rates of domestic violence and yet have low physical access to services.81  Allocate funding for services specifically for survivors of trafficking. This would allow providers to better meet survivors’ unique needs.  9   Enhance protections for immigrant women and survivors of traffickingBoost protections against wage theft. This would particularly help immigrant women and women in the informal economy who are disproportionately at risk of wage theft. Illinois should give workers tools to collect their stolen wages and prevent employers from evading their debts by moving assets or declaring bankruptcy. These measures would create incentives against wage theft for employers and ensure workers have recourse in the event that it does happen. Increase oversight and regulation of fields that have higher incidences of workplace violations and labor trafficking. These include childcare, construction, and landscaping. This would protect the rights of the most vulnerable workers.Support pathways to citizenship. This includes increasing support for equal access to justice, legal services, protection, and supports for immigrants. The state should also continue to grow protections in public spaces to limit inquiries about immigration status. Increase stability and open doors to opportunity. Illinois resident students who are ineligible for federal financial aid should be eligible for state and institutional financial aid at all institutions of higher learning in Illinois. Undocumented students would be major beneficiaries from this change, given their ineligibility for federal aid. Further, we need to provide undocumented immigrants legal protections against unscrupulous landlords that may attempt to use the climate of fear within immigrant communities to avoid legal obligations to maintain properties adequately, or harass and intimidate immigrant tenants.  LOOKING FORWARDHeartland Alliance  18GENDER + POVERTY10   Address the cycle of hardship perpetuated by justice system involvementRemove barriers to employment for people with criminal records. This would help women with records reintegrate into their communities, find and maintain employment, and increase housing stability. Employers should be prevented from refusing to hire or firing someone because of their criminal history unless convictions have a direct relationship to the employment sought. Remove “collateral consequences” laws that pose barriers to housing, education, and training for people with criminal records. This would make it easier for women with records to prepare for quality employment and maintain housing stability. Reform the criminal justice system. We need to ensure fair and equal law enforcement, eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, advance comprehensive sentencing reforms, and eliminate solitary confinement. These measures would make prison more humane for women, reduce the disproportionate impact of the War on Drugs for women, and make it easier for women to reintegrate into communities.

These pay gaps have ripple effects on black women’s families; eight in ten black women are either the sole earner or earn at least 40 percent of the household income.6 There are also differences in economic mobility—that is, the likelihood you’ll earn income higher than your parents’ income—between black and white women. Looking at individual earnings, black and white women have a similar likelihood of moving out of poverty. However, looking at family income, white women in families have a higher likelihood of moving out of poverty than black women. This may be because black women are more likely to be married to black men, who have lower likelihood of moving out of poverty.7 The myriad social issues depressing black men’s income—mass incarceration, educational inequities, discrimination, and more—impact the poverty status of the women in their families, too. Women of color are at risk of facing both racism and sexism in the workplace. Women of color report experiencing workplace harassment at a higher rate than men of color and white men and women.8  This harassment can have negative 5  Wilson,V., Rodters, W.M.

Throughout our nation’s history, white Americans crafted public policy that advanced their interests and grew their own wealth at the expense of others. While some of these policies may not still be on the books, the effects persist today: for generations, white people were able to pursue education, purchase property, run businesses, and pass on wealth to their children, while people of color could not. Women of color profoundly experience this legacy of legal racism and ongoing structural racism in addition to sex discrimination. Women of color are more likely to live in poverty than men of color and white people.1 This is influenced, in part, by the race-gender wage gap. Of all major race and ethnic groups, Latina women have the lowest median earnings.2 The wage gap between white women and black women has been growing. Wages for white women and black women were near parity in the 1970s, but by 2015, black women’s wages were 19 percent lower than white women’s.3 In fields that had the greatest wage growth for women and female-dominated industries, white women experienced more wage growth than black women.4 Differences in factors like education and 1  Author’s analysis of data from U.

Nearly a third of black women work in the service sector, which often has low wages and lacks key benefits such as sick time. In Illinois, the tipped subminimum wage is just $4.95 per hour. At all education levels, black women are concentrated in lower-wage jobs.11Women of color have poorer health than white women. Black (24%) and Latina (32%) women in Illinois are more likely to report poor health status than white women (16%).12  In Illinois, black women have higher HIV rates per 100,000 women (588.2) than Latina (127.8) and white (31.9) women. Black women across the country are more than three times as likely as white women to die in childbirth; rates of complications in Illinois hospitals who primarily serve black patients were 11 percent higher than in other hospitals.13Disparities in access to care are a likely  contributor to inequitable health outcomes 9  Buchanan, N.T., Fitzgerald, L.F.

Black and Latina women are more likely to skip or delay care than white women due to transportation barriers or inability to take time off work.15 It is notable that black women generally have high rates of routine health screenings and doctor access but also high rates of poor health outcomes,16 indicating that access to care is not the only solution to resolving racial health inequities. 14 The Henry J.

I wasn’t able to be a kid. I had to take care of my brothers while my mom was working and they were just so attached to me that even when she got home, I was with them,”  Zelda says. Despite her parents’ hard work, Zelda and her family lived in confined government-subsidized housing and struggled with poverty.“We lived in a small kitchenette that my parents divided with a sheet and my siblings and I were on one side and my parents on the other, right off the kitchen, and then we had the bathroom. My parents were on government assistance and people made fun of us a lot for, you know, using the government cheese and powdered milk... We went without a lot and we struggled. I wish that there would have just been some place for me to go to talk about the stress I was going through.”This cycle of poverty followed her into adulthood as she started her own family.“Even as an adult, we lived paycheck to paycheck, and you are always working to make money but it just was never enough, no matter how hard we were working.”Zelda said that oftentimes, she felt that what was expected of her was just to continue this cycle of poverty, because for women of color like her, that was the only opportunity available to survive.“Growing up as a black woman, I just felt like I was expected to just stay in the neighborhood and live off the government. No one told me that there was another way. There wasn’t supports to say, hey, there’s more to life than living like this.”*Zelda is a pseudonymZELDAWOMEN OF COLORHeartland Alliance  23THE GENDER DISADVANTAGELow-wage working women are profoundly impacted by gender inequities since they have fewer financial resources available to balance work and family needs or weather difficult patches. In addition, many low-wage jobs are poor quality and lack key benefits, such as paid family and medical leave, putting women at risk of losing their jobs if they get sick or have caregiving needs.The low-wage workforce is predominantly made up of women, especially women of color; two-thirds of low-wage workers are women, and half of low-wage workers are women of color. Most low-wage working women (90%) are beyond their teen years, and four out of five have a high-school diploma or higher. Many low-wage working women are the breadwinners in their households—65 percent do not have a second income in their family. Low-wage working mothers, in particular, have lower family incomes than low-wage working women overall.11  Morrison, A., Gallagher-Robbins, K. (2015, September). The women in the low-wage workforce may not be who you think, Women in the low-wage workforce chartbook. Washington D.C.: National Women’s Law Center. Many low-wage jobs are low quality: that is, they lack important benefits and include unpredictable schedules. In Illinois, an estimated 44 percent of workers lack paid sick time at their employer.2 Low-wage workers are even more deeply impacted: over 80 percent nationwide lack paid sick time at work.3 This means that low-wage workers must choose between showing up to work sick and jeopardizing their and others’ health, or risking their employment and pay. Forty percent of low-wage workers work nonstandard hours, with single mothers earning less than $20,000 per year being twice as likely as other workers to work nonstandard schedules.4  2 Institute for Women’s Policy Research & National Partnership for Women & Families.

Heartland Alliance  24THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEWhile the widespread lack of caregiving supports in the U.S. poses difficulties for all women workers, low-wage women workers particularly struggle to balance work and caregiving responsibilities. Low-wage workers are less likely than higher-wage workers to qualify for the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to care for their own health or family members’ health since they are more likely to stay at jobs for less than a year, work for small employers, or work part-time,5 and 45 percent of employers do not offer unpaid family leave to employees of less than a year outside of FMLA.6 Workers with wages in the bottom tenth of the income distribution had low rates of access to paid family leave (4%) and paid personal leave (9%).7 It’s harder for low-wage working women to pay others for caregiving, and low-wage workers are more likely than high-wage workers to be caring for a family member who is sick.8 If a family member becomes ill, low-wage workers are likely to struggle with caregiving in addition to work: 71 percent lack sick days that can be used for caring for family.9 High caregiving needs, coupled with poor job benefits, can result in low-wage workers disrupting their workday due to family responsibilities, putting themselves at risk of sanctions or job loss.10   Women’s earnings from work are more vulnerable to wage theft and violations than men’s earnings are. Women are more likely to experience a violation of minimum wage laws than men are, and of women who are eligible for overtime, 83% experienced overtime violations (compared to 73% for men).11 of Law.5  Ibid.6  O’Leary, A.

Seven in ten Asian women and one-third of Latina women in Illinois were not born in the U.S. Of that group, 40 percent of foreign-born Asian women and two-thirds of foreign-born Latina women are non-citizens. Non-citizen women experience poverty at rates that are 1.5 times higher than native-born women.1 Immigrant women, especially those who are undocumented, face particular barriers to economic security, including limited work opportunities and access to the safety net. Immigration status can pose serious barriers to finding quality jobs. Some immigrant women may not have work authorization, and even those who do may find it difficult to find an employer willing to sponsor their visa (and if they do, the visa may not be approved). Women who are not U.S. citizens are over-represented in the low-wage workforce (in 2015, 2 in 5 immigrant women earned less than $20,000 per year).2 Immigrant women largely work in domestic, healthcare, and service industries, and make up half the workforce of those grading and sorting agricultural products, appearance workers (such as hairstylists and cosmetologists), and housekeepers.3 Most low-wage immigrant women workers are from Latin America.4 1  Author’s analysis of data from U.

If workers are undocumented, they may fear reporting violations and run the risk of deportation. Undocumented women are more likely than undocumented men to experience wage violations (such as wage theft or being paid less than minimum wage). Over half of undocumented women in one study experienced minimum wage violations, compared to one-quarter of documented foreign-born women and 18 percent of native-born women. Part of the reason for the high rate of wage violations among undocumented women is that they are more likely than undocumented men to work in industries, such as child care, that experience high rates of wage violations. Undocumented women are also more likely than documented women to work in the informal labor market.5 5  Petrescu-Prahova, M., Spiller, M.W. (2016, November 1).

She experienced the difficulties of trying to create a new life for herself when she arrived to the United States at 18 years old. “I moved in with a family, taking care of their kids—looking to find new opportunities. When somebody says ‘I’ll bring you to the US,’ you just think you’re going to live the American dream. But you don’t know about the culture, the system, or immigration. Then I got here, and at the beginning, you don’t know that there’s a system. You don’t know you need a Social Security card and things like that. The longer you go, the more challenging it is. And you don’t realize you are vulnerable.”Delilah said that the only resources she felt were available to her at the time were the ones that the families she worked for could provide.“I moved in with another family into Chicago, and they allowed me to stay without paying. They told me about some local ESL classes. I started there and began going to college from there. Any little bit of money people would give me, I would save for my education. When you are undocumented, people who are kind to you have their intentions. As a woman, you have to be careful. You are in a vulnerable situation. You are constantly taken advantage of because of the situation you are in. There is a different level of freedom when you are financially free and stable.”Delilah realized she needed an education if she wanted to reach her goals: “It was about four or five years in, I decided I wanted to go to school—and that’s when I realized I needed to be documented.” “I’m now working with LAF to get my green card. Somebody connected me to the Kovler Center. I was just going there to talk about stress and hoping to find medical help. They let me know that what had happened in the past was not right.”*Delilah is a pseudonymDELILAHIMMIGRANT WOMENHeartland Alliance  27THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEDiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity results in significant inequities in economic outcomes.

LGBTQ WOMEN AND GENDER NON-CONFORMING PEOPLE Significant percentages of LGBTQ people report that their sexuality was a factor in being fired or denied employment (8 to 17 percent), being denied a promotion or given a negative performance review (10 to 28 percent), being verbally or physically assaulted (7 to 41 percent), and receiving unequal pay or benefits (10 to 19 percent).6 In Illinois, 15 percent of trans people lost a job and 28 percent were fired, not promoted, or not hired due to their gender identity.7 There is consistent evidence from experimental studies that sexual orientation discrimination occurs in the workplace.8 6  Badgett, M.V., Lou, H., Sears, B., & Ho, D.

Washington D.C. 8  Bias in the workplace: Consistent evidence of sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination; Sexual Orientation Discrimination in Hiring; Documented Evidence of Employment Discrimination and Its Effects on LGBT PeopleA NOTE ON RESEARCH ON THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. There is great variation within the LGBTQ community in terms of economic needs, barriers, and opportunities based in part on their gender identity, sexuality, gender presentation, and more. For example, while both experience discrimination, a white feminine-presenting cisgender lesbian woman may have a very different experience navigating society than a visibly gender non-conforming black person. Nonetheless, much of the research uses the LGBT or LGBTQ grouping to disaggregate data on economic well-being. This section aims to include more nuances when the evidence base allows for it, but, in general, research on this community is relatively nascent and data on LGBTQ individuals are extremely limited. Since this report focuses on gender discrimination and experiences of poverty, this section focuses on the experiences of trans people and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer women. because of their gender identity/expressionlost a job15%were fired, denied a promotion, or were not hired 28% because of their gender identity/expressionTrans people in Illinois experience barriers to employment:Source: National Center for Transgender Equality.

One study comparing transgender to cisgender siblings (therefore ensuring that they had similar resources and experiences in childhood) found that, even though the trans siblings were more educated, they earned less than the cisgender siblings.9 LGBT people are disproportionately victims of violence. Experiencing violence is often traumatizing, and unaddressed trauma can keep or push people into poverty by making it hard to succeed at school and at work.10 One-quarter of LGBTQ youth experienced sexual violence, and 18 percent experienced physical violence.11 Trans and gender non-conforming people experience violence at high rates, especially trans people of color.12 Rates of homelessness and housing barriers are disproportionately high among trans people. 1.5 percent of the people experiencing homelessness in Chicago are trans, which is three times higher than the 0.5 percent of the city’s population who are trans.13 Nearly 1 in 4 trans people in Illinois report being evicted due to their gender identity. Just 2 in 5 trans people in Illinois report owning a home, compared to 61 percent of the general population.14 9  Factor, R.J., Rothblum, E.D. (2007, February).

These immigrant groups often face violence and threats from their family members, fellow citizens, or their own governments, prompting them to seek asylum.15 However, based on the trauma they endured, trans asylum seekers may not be open about the persecution they faced in their home country for fear of suffering the same fate in the U.S. Furthermore, immigration detention is an especially dangerous and dehumanizing experience for trans and gender non-conforming immigrants. A recent report shows that LGBTQ immigrants in federal detention centers are 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than other detainees.16 LGBT people have unique mental and physical health needs. Nearly half of trans people in Illinois report having attempted suicide at some point in their lives, which is 28 times higher than the general population’s rate.17 LGBTQ youth are at a higher risk of health issues than non-LGBTQ youth, including substance use, STDs, obesity, anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular disease.18 Unfortunately, LGBTQ people often receive poorer quality healthcare due to stigmas about the needs of their community.19Transgender Survey: Illinois State Report.

Once she made the decision to seek resources to transition in 2009, she struggled to find proper healthcare and safe housing options. “Finding the right medical assistance was hard, but when I found Howard Brown Health, it got easy real fast. I was afraid to even talk to a regular doctor because of just the fear and the stigma. But once I started going to Howard Brown, I was able to start hormones around Thanksgiving 2009,” Eva says.Though Eva was on the path to transitioning and receiving the medical resources she needed, she was facing an unsafe and unreliable housing situation: “I was living in a seedy transient SRO [single room occupancy] and that was scary. At the SRO I would get creepy looks and some people would be outright negative towards me or try and hit on me because there is an assumption that a transgender woman, or a queer femme, is always into men and that is not always the case.”Eva’s fear for her safety even led her to make different choices about how she traveled through her building: “At the SRO, I lived on the 5th floor and I was too scared to take the elevators. I was scared I would get trapped in there with someone, but in the stairs, I could run. I faced abuse and had things thrown at me.”Even now, she thinks about her safety when she travels throughout the city: “I have my safety zone. From downtown Evanston to like the South Loop, that is my area. I may slip out to other neighborhoods but I just don’t go that far. I have confidence now that has been built up, but when I first came out I felt like everyone was staring at me.”When it comes to ending poverty in Illinois, Eva thinks it will take a long time to achieve. In the meantime, she believes people experiencing poverty still should be able to live in safety and dignity: “I may be living in poverty and I’m queer femme, but look at the dignity I am living in. If you have a positive attitude and positive places you can fall back on like Heartland Alliance, Howard Brown, and Center on Halsted, you can be okay and still have dignity.”LGBTQ WOMEN AND GENDER NON-CONFORMING PEOPLE Heartland Alliance  30THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEA growing number of women are entering prison.1 Many women who go to prison are poor and leave prison facing the prospect of living in poverty. And women of color are more likely to be impacted by incarceration than white women—black women are twice as likely to be imprisoned as white women.2 Nearly two-thirds of women in state prison and over half of women in federal prison are mothers,3 which means that their incarceration leaves behind children who will be missing a caretaker and creates traumatic experiences for women trying to maintain connections with their children. Over 60 percent of incarcerated parents are imprisoned more than 100 miles away from their children.4Women are more likely than men to end up in prison for crimes driven by economic need. Women are more likely than men to end up in prison for property crimes, which are often motivated by poverty or substance use,5 and drug crimes.6 Indeed, 37 percent of women in prison had incomes of less than $600 per month prior 1  Bloom, B., Owen, B., & Covington, S.

Women who are incarcerated are more likely to struggle with substance use than men who are incarcerated.9 And women in prison are frequently survivors of trauma, which, if untreated, can have psychological effects that may raise the likelihood of both poverty and aggression.10 Childhood physical or sexual abuse and adult violent victimization are reported in high rates by women in prison.11 Experiencing violence, sexual assault, and human rights abuses, such as solitary confinement, in prison re-traumatizes women.12 Treatment programming for women in prison is often modeled after programming for men and does not take into account unique gendered experiences and needs.137  Bloom, B., Owen, B., & Covington, S.

Heartland Alliance  31THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEPolicies in the War on Drugs that increased mandatory minimum sentences and reduced judicial discretion over sentencing resulted in longer sentences for women convicted of drug crimes. Women’s incarceration rates in state prisons grew by 888% between 1986 and 1996, compared to men’s incarceration rates growing 522%. Drug crimes can often be crimes of survival for women with substance use disorders. Women can end up in prison even for tangential relationships to drug trafficking, such as allowing a partner with drugs in her home.14 14  McConnell, T. (2017). The war on women: The collateral consequences of female incarceration. Lewis & Clark Law Review, Vol. 21(20), 493-524.Upon release from prison, women have the deck stacked against them. Women’s trauma, mental health, and substance use needs are often inadequately treated in prison and inadequate discharge planning upon release can result in a sudden disconnect from medical care and medication.15 Laws and informal policies restricting access to public housing, rental housing, and jobs for people with criminal records make it hard for women leaving prison to move out of poverty and maintain housing stability. Illinois poses restrictions to TANF and SNAP for people with drug records, meaning that women with drug records may struggle to meet basic human needs.16 Even though maintaining familial bonds reduces women’s recidivism, women who have been incarcerated are at risk  of losing parental rights as judges may  use their incarceration as evidence of  unfitness as a parent.17 15  Ibid.16  Beitsch, R.

Victims of trafficking may come from other countries, or they may be trafficked domestically. Women and girls make up the vast majority of identified trafficking victims,1 while LGBTQ youth are more likely to experience trafficking than non-LGBTQ youth.2 Callers to the National Human Trafficking Hotline in 2017 most commonly identified themselves as Latino or Asian.3Human trafficking exists because poverty exists. Traffickers seek out individuals who are missing something—economic opportunity, education, documented immigration status, love, support, or safety, for example.4  Trafficking helpline callers report high incidences of recent migration, substance use, running away and homelessness, mental health issues, and involvement in the child welfare system5—all issues that can be 1  UNODC (2016, December).

To recruit victims, traffickers offer an opportunity that will fill this void. But in reality, they are coercing the individual into an exploitative situation. And traffickers commonly use tactics of economic manipulation and abuse to coerce their victims.6 Even when women and girls break ties with their traffickers, it may be difficult for them to succeed in school or at work. For working-age women, they may lack a traditional employment history and will need to develop job skills and experience. Other survivors may have work experience, but if it is related to their trafficking, they cannot list it on their resume due to safety concerns. Some survivors of trafficking may have criminal records related to their time being trafficked, which poses additional barriers to employment.7 Trafficking survivors often need housing and financial support as they transition out of trafficking, and foreign-born survivors who may not have documented status have limited access to housing subsidies and the federal safety net (though Illinois recently expanded access to state welfare programs for foreign-born survivors of trafficking waiting on their visas). 6  Ibid.7  Hickle, K.

Since immigrating to the United States, she has faced homelessness, human trafficking, and mental health issues. She first encountered her trafficker when she was living in a homeless shelter. “This dude delivered food to the shelter, too; he was actually like one would imagine a good person being: someone who donates to homeless shelters. That is how I came across him. He was just a volunteer, which is scary to me. That is an important part of sharing my story. There’s no measure for vulnerability. Just because you’re homeless doesn’t mean things can’t get worse.”“I was taken out of the city when I was trafficked, which made it harder to find services,” Toni says. “No one was able to give me help that was going to get me out of the situation, so I didn’t tell them I was being human trafficked and I didn’t really consider myself a victim of human trafficking at that point, so even with the amount of services that are in Chicago, there is a drought in our state.”When Toni was in her trafficking situation, her mental health suffered: “It got a lot worse. When I moved out of the city, I wasn’t able to get my medication. My mental health was definitely part of me being trafficked for as long as I was. When you are not doing well, people are more able to take advantage of you.”After breaking ties with her trafficker, she faced the fear that he would return, but was able to begin healing: “The first few months were really hard because my trafficker is in the local area and I was just convinced that he was going to find me and things would not end well. But I got back in touch with Heartland and got a case manager.”Toni says services are critical for survivors of trafficking looking to get back on their feet: “I cannot explain how much of a big deal it’s been working with FFT. They allowed me to get stable housing. I’ve got SNAP, Medicare, I can actually take care of myself now. A lot of services that should be available just aren’t. I’m lucky enough to have been both homeless and human trafficked and be on the other side of it so I kind of feel compelled to do something about the things that I’ve experienced that haven’t been that great.”*Toni is a pseudonymTONIWOMEN WHO ARE TRAFFICKED Heartland Alliance  34THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEIntimate partner violence and poverty can feed into each other: poverty makes it difficult to escape intimate partner violence situations, and intimate partner violence can push people into poverty.1 Intimate partner violence (IPV) falls underneath the larger umbrella of gender-based violence (GBV). It is inherently a gendered issue in the U.S. and globally, given the imbalanced power hierarchies across genders and sexual orientations. IPV includes other common terms such as domestic violence, domestic abuse, rape, sexual assault, and marital abuse. Women experience IPV at a higher rate than men do2—the overwhelming majority of people who seek IPV services in Illinois are women (88% of service recipients from 2015 – 2017).3 And black women experience IPV more frequently than white women.4 1  Goodman, L.A., Smyth, K.F., Borges, A.M., & Singer, R.

However, these experiences are also highly underreported.6 Intimate partner violence often results in economic instability. Economic control is a strategy frequently used by abusers. Abusers often interfere with their victims’ ability to maintain employment7 by forbidding them to leave the house, causing injuries that require time away from work, or taking away resources necessary to get to work.8 64 percent of IPV victims in one study reported that their abuse made it hard for them to work.9 Another study 5  The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

Student survivors may have spotty attendance, struggle to pay attention in class, and are at risk of dropping out, raising the likelihood of future poverty. Illinois policies and procedures related to student survivors too often are not trauma-informed.14 When survivors seek services, they indicate high needs for credit repair, building assets, housing, food and clothing assistance, and other financial supports.15 In Chicago, half of survivors seeking services were not employed and 44 percent had monthly incomes below $500. Despite this significant financial need, 10  Modi, M.N., Palmer, S., & Armstrong, A. (2013, December).

A quarter of survivors seeking services requested shelter, and, on average, survivors spent a month in shelters.17 Permanent housing is also a critical need for survivors.18 Unfortunately, 27 percent of service providers in Chicago report that they got requests for emergency housing that could not be met, and 20 percent report getting requests for permanent housing that they could not meet.19 Even if survivors can find housing, they may have trouble maintaining it. Housing problems such as skipping bills, paying rent late, and being threatened with eviction are commonly reported by survivors in the first year after separation.20 Survivors may have to move if their abusers find out where they live.

Heartland Alliance.INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND POVERTY Heartland Alliance  36THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEHeartland Alliance employee Zelda* has faced poverty and sexual/intimate partner domestic violence. See “Women of Color” section for more on Zelda’s story. “From five to eight [years old], I was sexually abused by a male family member and I felt like I had no one to go to. No one or nothing to support me. I wish that there would have been therapy available, but in my community, it was just looked down upon because we were told to keep it to yourself, that if you talk to someone you’re crazy —but what’s crazy is not talking to someone when things are happening to you.”In addition to her traumatic experience as a child, she grew up to experience intimate partner violence with her longtime partner: “He was not a good person and he just beat me. But then when we had kids, he and his family became so controlling and I felt like I couldn’t even be a parent. I felt like I had nowhere else to go, so I stayed.”This controlling and violent situation left Zelda trapped in a place where she was unable to make decisions for herself or even work to save money and move towards a safer life.“I was in that relationship for 14 years and during that time I wasn’t allowed to work and if, for some reason, I was allowed to have a job, it wasn’t for long because I would have to call in sick all of the time because of black eyes and stitches. I couldn’t make any money for myself. He was the sole provider for myself and my kids.”This violence impacted Zelda’s mental health: “The violence I experienced impacted me mentally because I was always in fear. I stayed because of fear. I was fearful of black eyes, fearful of broken ribs, of the having to get 12 staples put in my head again...To this day, I am fearful of men. Male service providers, doctors. I’ve even turned down a job because I found out a man was going to be my boss.”“My goals for the future are to always be better than I was the day before. I want to keep a steady job and income and I want to write and publish a book...My goal is to also be happy and I choose happiness every day.”*Zelda is a pseudonymZELDAINTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND POVERTY Heartland Alliance  37THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEWhile the majority of people experiencing homelessness are men, a significant number of women experience homelessness as well. 41 percent of people experiencing homelessness in Illinois are women,1 and 38 percent of people receiving homeless services in Chicago are women.2 Certain groups of women are at disproportionate risk of homelessness. Women veterans experience homelessness at a rate that is 2.5 to 4 times higher than their percentage of the general population.3 Women veterans experience sexual trauma at a rate higher than the general population, which puts them at risk for homelessness.4 Compared to housed women veterans, women veterans experiencing homelessness were more likely to be unemployed, disabled, low-income, less healthy, and have an experience of sexual trauma.5 In addition to military service, other 1  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Competing difficulties meeting physical and mental health needs has been shown to cause distress for black and Latina women experiencing homelessness.10 Women are at risk of 6  Washington, D.l., Yano, E.M., McGuire, J., Hines, V., Lee, M. & Gelberg, L.

These neurological processes result in difficulty exhibiting self-control, reasoning, problem-solving, and planning13—all skills that are crucial to exiting, and staying out of, poverty and homelessness.14Women who are homeless have poorer health than women who are not.

Women report experiencing discrimination from prospective landlords and employers based on intersecting identities and experiences, such as homeless status, living in a transitional living facility, criminal record, mental illness, race, single motherhood, and income source.17 The practicalities of finding and keeping a job are particularly difficult for women experiencing homelessness, especially those with children. Women experiencing homelessness frequently find it difficult to access reliable childcare when going on interviews or going to work, and struggle to find the resources for “professional” clothing and hygiene.18 Barriers to work and housing, combined with the barriers posed by past and ongoing trauma, make it challenging for women experiencing homelessness to move out of poverty.15  Teruya, C., Longshore, D.

See the “Women who are Trafficked” section for more on Toni’s story.Toni recieved a full ride to go to a university in Illinois. However, shortly after arriving, Toni lost her scholarship due to a sports injury: “I had some problems in school and got injured, so they tried to take my scholarship away and I ended up homeless.” She was able to return to school but  was still homeless: “It was such a contrast, because I was coming from a shelter where I’m sleeping with 50 strangers every night and trying to get my homework done and then I’m going to university in the daytime with some of the richest kids I’ve ever been around. It was challenging but I certainly think that having school while I was homeless was my saving grace because it’s important to have something to keep yourself going.”During this time, finding resources to help her was a challenge and she sees the lack of services as one of the most crucial pieces missing in addressing homelessness in Illinois.“Other than the services Heartland Alliance has provided for me, I don’t see those things for people like me. It’s not there. I speak English, I’m smart, and I have a secondary education. So if you don’t speak English as your first language or haven’t been fortunate to have an education, you’re going to have an even harder time.”Her experience with homelessness also exacerbated her mental health struggles: “Being homeless sucks. Everyone has an understanding of that. But being on a curfew, being stuck in a room with strangers you don’t know, not being able to get a good night’s sleep, that’s not good for anyone’s mental health, let alone someone with preexisting things going on. If mental health services were more available, I categorically believe that things would be better. I just don’t know how people expect people to just pull up their pants, pull up their socks and just get on with not being mentally ill anymore.”Toni believes that homelessness can be solved if we put resources where they are needed:“I genuinely believe it’s an antidote to homelessness. Resources suck generally, but they’re so unevenly distributed throughout the city, it’s disgusting and I can’t imagine how you expect it to get better as a whole if you’re just leaving pieces unattended. It’s totally solvable. It does not need to be a problem in our city anymore. But hopefully I’ll get the chance to come and make a difference with some of that stuff once I get my visa.”*Toni is a pseudonymTONIWOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS Heartland Alliance  40THE GENDER DISADVANTAGEGLOSSARY Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA):  FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.

    "abstract": "Poverty does not treat everyone equally. Women, children, gender minorities, and people of color are often the hardest hit. And while women in poverty experience the same issues that all people in poverty experience—income inequality, unemployment, poor health, violence, trauma, and more—the odds are often uniquely stacked against them in gendered ways.There are 6.5 million women. and an estimated 50,000 trans people living in Illinois. They are a driving force in our economy and care for our children, sick, and elderly, and yet continue to face discrimination and inequitable opportunities. This year's annual report on poverty in Illinois shows how gender, gender identity, and gender norms shape experiences of poverty for women and gender minorities—and how women who have other marginalized identities experience even more inequity. If we want to dramatically reduce poverty, improving the well-being of women— particularly women of color—would deliver the biggest return",
