Alan Cavallo was named San Jose State’s Interim Chief of Police on March 28, according to an email sent to the campus community by Chief Financial Officer Charlie Faas.The position was left vacant after former Chief of Police Peter Decena resigned to serve as the Los Gatos-Monte Sereno Police Department’s police chief. Cavallo began his new position after Decena left on March 30.“I feel like it’s going to be a big challenge,” Cavallo said. “I’m looking forward to the challenge, but it’s going to be a bit of a juggling act. I get to do my job and the chief ’s job. So I’m trying to figure out how I’m going to do both in a reasonable amount of time.”The interim chief of police position is assigned to a member of the department or a neighboring department. According to Faas’ email, Cavallo was selected for the position because of his professional experience and commitment to UPD and the campus community.Cavallo began working Hundreds of people marched from San Jose City Hall to Plaza de Cesar Chavez for immigrants’ rights on Friday. Many of them waved flags or carried signs that were directed at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). De Anza College students Alexandra Gonzalez and Jennifer Garcia planned the rally after a debate in their Chicano history class. Gonzalez said she was sick of history being repeated without anybody acknowledging previous events. “We have all of these heated discussions in class, but we wanted to know what we could do to have our voice leave the classroom and into the streets,” Gonzalez said. Garcia wanted to organize this rally because she has friends and family members who are undocumented.(Left) Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice speaks about the current political climate in the Student Union Ballroom on March 22.

Until that time, Cavallo will be in charge of the UPD.San Jose joins the nationwide protest against gun violenceALEX MARTINET | SPARTAN DAILYProtesters gather together to protest gun violence at the March for Our Lives Rally at Arena Green Park in San Jose on March 24. Many sought to spark change in national gun control policy.LISA PRINCIPI | UPDATE NEWS READ THE FULL ARTICLE ONLINEREAD THE FULL ARTICLE ONLINE“Recently, there have been a lot of ICE raids in San Jose and long friendships are being separated,” Garcia said. “It’s time to stop and respect each other as humans.” On Feb. 25, federal agents arrested more than 150 people during a three-day sweep across Northern California. According to the LA Times, half of those arrested had a criminal record. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf alerted the public 24 hours before the ICE raids occurred urging residents to “prepare, not panic.” As the crowd marched toward Plaza de Cesar Chavez, some people stopped in front of the Robert F. Peckham Federal Building on First Street. For five minutes, the crowd walked around the block and chanted, “The people united will never be defeated” and “El Pueblo unido, jamás será vencido!”At Plaza de Cesar Chavez, people were invited to speak about any issue. San Jose State art senior Estefania Bautista spoke first recalling the time she was taken away from her home country of El Salvador after the U.S. started the Salvadoran Civil War in 1980. The U.S. contributed to the conflict by providing large amounts of military aid to the government of El Salvador, according to the magazine The Nation.U.S. officers took over high ranks in the Salvadoran military to modernize the army. The Atlantic, a weekly magazine, estimates that 35 percent of the civilians in El Salvador were disenfranchised because of the war. “It’s their fault they came into my country and started a civil war and now they RIGHTS | Page 2Follow Andrew on Twitter@SaviorElite10don’t want us here,” Bautista said. “They don’t want us here, whether they fucked up our country.”Since the 2016 election, arrests by deportation officers have soared according to Politifact, a media fact-checking website. People deported after being arrested away from the border has jumped 25 percent. Additionally, 58 percent of Border Patrol arrests were people from countries other than Mexico with majority coming from Central America.In President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office, deportation officers arrested more than 41,000 people on civil immigration charges, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Mechanical engineering freshman Gustavo Garay said he couldn’t stand seeing ICE officials terrorize his community. “There is always that fear that if all immigrants were deported, I would have no one left in my life, my family or my friends,” Garay said. Electric engineering sophomore Jibraan Qureshi came to the rally and held a sign that read “American Muslims support the Dreamers.” Qureshi is an employee at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which often works in collaboration with Services, Immigrant Rights and Education Network. “We wanted to show our support because what they are going through is the same thing we’re going through,” Qureshi said. Garcia said she hoped the rally brought the community together and raised awareness about ICE raids. “Diversity has been the foundation of what has made United States special and we’re going to fight like hell to keep it that way,” Garcia said.De Anza College student Chris Tran once camped outside a store for 18 hours for a chance to purchase the Air Max 97/1 Sean Wotherspoon collaboration. Tran who collects and sells sneakers owns a collection of 42 shoes in his closet. If Tran were to sell his entire collection, he said his collection would go for anywhere between $15,000 to $18,000 on the sneaker market. The sneaker market, also known as the sneaker resell market, has been around for years and has more recently gained popularity as an option for sneaker collectors to make profits off selling sneakers. Collectors sell them either online or in consignment stores. “I always consider market value as well as the condition of my pair,” Tran said. “People always value shoes differently depending on condition, so as long as I have general knowledge of my shoe’s value, I can justify the price considering it’s condition. Knowing how to price and value shoes is a key of being in the sneaker game. You never want to overpay someone or cut yourself short.”There is no exact origin or starting point when the sneaker market was established, but some “sneakerheads” believe it was when the first Air Jordan was released in 1985. The Air Jordan 1 Bred Toe can be seen as the start of people coveting highly popular sneakers. There also have been certain sneaker releases that increased the sneaker market’s popularity.Business finance junior Patrick Ho said he believed the release of Adidas brand sneakers Yeezy in 2015 drove the sneaker market to grow. “Ever since then resale prices just went through the roof and people would buy the shoes if they wanted them or not to make a profit,” Ho said. Countless models in the line designed by rapper Kanye West sold out the same day they were released to the public. People who resell sneakers will buy as many pairs of a desired shoe as possible for the retail price. Once the sneaker is completely sold out in stores, resellers will then attempt to sell above the original retail price of the sneaker on the sneaker market. One example is the Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 Turtle Doves. The sneakers were released in June 2015 for a retail price of $200, according to the Sole Collector website. The sneaker is now being sold for nearly 10 times as much on the consignment shop Flight Club, which sells the shoe for $1,900.Tran had a different opinion on what triggered the rise of the sneaker market. “I personally believe that the hype in the sneaker community began with Jordan’s and SB’s,” Train said. “Today, everyone thinks that Yeezy’s and all these collaborations are the backbone of the culture, but it was much simpler than that. I feel like Jordan’s played a key role in growth of the sneaker culture before when there was a high NEWSsjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 20182\u0007\u0017\u0015\u0016\u0018\u0012\u0014\u0018\u000e\u0012\u0013\u0011\u0018\t\u000b\u0002\u0006\b\u0004\u0018\u0005\u000b\u000b\u0003\u0018\f\u0001\u000f\u0010\u0018\u0004\u0011\u0005*\u0016\u000f\u0014*\u0012\t\u0010\u0010\t\u000e\u0007*\u0005\u0004\u000b\u0012*\u0004\u0012*\u0004*\u0011\u0005\u0012\u0014\f*\u000f\u0006*\u000e\u000f\u0013*\b\u0004\u0015\t\u000e\u0007*\u0005\u000e\u000f\u0014\u0007\b*\u000f\u000e\u0005\u0016\u0003*\u0006$\u001b%\u001e*\u001c$'\u001f&\u0001*(\u001b\u001d\u001b&\u0017\u0018!\u001b%*\u0017\"\u001a*\u001d$#\u0019\u001b$\u001f\u001b%*) !!*\u0018\u001b*\u0017(\u0017\u001f!\u0017\u0018!\u001b\u0002*\u0005PRIL\u000e\u0004\u000e\\\u000eAY\u000e\u0017\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0001\u0001\u0005\u0003\u0002\u0004\u0002\u0005\u0001\u0005\u0002\u0002\u0005\u0004\u0002\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0002\u0004\u0002\u0006\u0003\u0006\b\u0002\t\u0002\u0004\u0007\u0001\u0002\u0004\u0007\u0002\u0005\u000f\u0013\u0017\u0015\f\u0013\u000f/\f\u0017/ \u0016\f\u0013/\f\u0015\u0012\u0014\u0016/ \u0002/\u000b\u0017\u0010/ \u0016\u0017\u0015\u000f\u000f\u0017/\u0017&/'+\u0019\" \u001e./\u001e&(/*\u001f!)/\u001e(\u001d\u001d/)\u001d(, \u001b\u001d/.&+/$+)*/\u001a\u001d/\u0019/\u001b+((\u001d%*/\u0016\u0011\u0016\u0018/)*+\u001c\u001d%*/-!*\u001f/\u0019%/\u0019%%+\u0019#/  %\u001b&$\u001d/\u001a\u001d\"&-/\u0001\u0007\b\u0003\t\u0006\u0004/ \u000e )*( \u001a+* &%/ )/&%/\u0019/\u001e!()*/\u001b&$\u001d\u0003/\u001e ()*/)\u001d(,\u001d\u001c/\u001a\u0019) )\u0005/\u0002\u0007\u0003\u0012\u0007\u0017\u0004\u0011\u000b\u000e\t\u0017\u0016\u000f\u0014\u0011\u0017\u000f\u0015\u000e\u0017\u0004\u0003\t\u0012\u0017\u0013\u000f\u0017\u0010\u000b\u0005\f\u0017\u0014\u0010\u0017\u0013\u0007\u0017\b\u000f\u000f\u0006\u0001\u0017\u0003\u0015\u0013\t\u001f\u0015\u0015\b\u001f\u001a\t\u0013\u0019\u001f\u0005\u0017\t\u001f\u0016\t\u0018\u000e\u0019\f\u0005\u0006\u0011\t\u001f\u0005\u0014\b\u001f\u001d\u000e\u0011\u0011\u001f\u0014\t\t\b\u001f\u001b\u0015\u001f\u0006\t\u001f\u0017\t\u0017\u000b\t\u0017\u0005\u001b\t\b\u001f\u0019\f\u0015\u0017\u001b\u0012\u001e\u001f\u0005\u001a\t\u0017\u001f\u0016\u0007\u0010\u001f\u001c\u0016\u0001\u001f\u0004\u000e\u0019\u000e\u001b\u001f\u0019\u000f\u0019\u001c\u0001\t\b\u001c\u0002\u0019\u000f\u0019\u001c\u0007\u0005\u0017\t\u0019\u001f\u0015\u0017\u001f\u0013\u0015\u0017\t\u001f\u000e\u0014\u0015\u0017\u0013\u0005\u001b\u0015\u0014\u0001\u001f\u0010\u0017\u0019#+\u0015'\u0015\u001e$+\u0019#+(\u0018\u0015\u0015\u001b\u0013\u0017\u0011\u0019!+\u0011\u0013\u0013\u0015##\u001a\u0012\u001c\u0015\u0003+ \u001f\u0014\u0019'\u0019\u0014&\u0011\u001b#+\u001e\u0015\u0015\u0014\u0019\u001f\u0016+\u0011\u001f)+ $\u0017\u0015\"+\u0011\u0013\u0013 \u001d*\u001d \u0014\u0011$\u0019 \u001f#+#\u0017 &\u001c\u0014+\u0013 \u001e$\u0011\u0013$+\u000e \u001e\u0019\u0013\u0011+\u000f\u0011\"%\u001a\u001e+\u0011$+\b\u0005\u000b\u0001\f\u0006\b\u0002\u0006\t\u0007\u0004+\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004MONDAY, APR.9 10:00 A.M - 11:15 A.MEXECUTIVE EDITORSARAH KLIEVESMANAGING EDITORTHOMAS SOARESEXECUTIVE PRODUCERMARCI SUELAPRODUCTION EDITORNICHOLAS GIRARDNEWS EDITORWILLIAM YAPA&E EDITORJOSE F.

According to the center, the area around Bestor Art Park has nearly 4,000 residents.  The group often works in association with CommUniverCity San Jose to host events that bring kids and parents to the park. CommUniverCity San Jose provides opportunities for SJSU students to give back to the community.  E n v i r o n m e n t a l studies sophomore Larry Castrence hid Easter eggs around the park.  Castrence volunteered at the event because his BUS3 160: Fundamentals of Management and Organizational Behavior class requires 10 community service hours. “When I volunteer, ultimately it’s to have fun and to make a difference to the community,” Castrence said.  This was the second year the Easter egg hunt was held at the park. Elizabeth Figueroa, special programs manager at CommUniverCity San Jose, said it brought  people together in the neighborhood that are segmented from the industrial areas. “Last year, we had only 150 people show up for the event,” Figueroa said. “But this year we have easily triple that.”    Carol Valentine, special programs manager for Spartan Keyes Neighborhood Action, hoped that this event brought a positive change to local residents.“We hope events like these establish building blocks of trust in the neighborhood,” Valentine said. San Jose resident Carolyn Castagnetoo brought her six-year-old daughter Abigal to enjoy making Easter eggs in the park. She found the Easter egg hunt a great opportunity to meet new friends in the community. “We love to get together with the community and Abigail to meet new friends,” Castagnetoo said.BY ALEX MARTINETSTAFF WRITERFollow Alex on Twitter@almartinetChildren dash to collect Easter eggs spread across a fi eld in Bestor Art Park in San Jose on Saturday.RIGHTSContinued from page 1Follow Alex on Twitter@almartinetALEX MARTINET | SPARTAN DAILYsjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 2018ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT 3Gallery showcases eco-friendly pieces EVENT RECAPBY LOVETTA JACKSONSTAFF WRITER Follow Lovetta on Twitter@LovettaajacksonThe piece “Tears of Ra” by Shannon Amidon is one of numerous displayed in the exhibit “Art Inspector: Saving the Earth by Changing Art.” The event revolved around informing people about eco-friendly ways of creating art. LOVETTA JACKSON | SPARTAN DAILYBY ANDREW GLENNSTAFF WRITER MOVIE REVIEW‘Ready Player One’ loads into theatersINTHEATERS“Ready Player One”Directed by:Craig GillespieStarring: Tye Sheridan,Olivia CookeGenre: Adventure/Sci-FiRating: \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002Follow Andrew on Twitter@SaviorElite10“Ready Player One” is a great film with stunning visuals and a remarkable cast. Never before have so many video game, movie and comic book characters been brought together in one film. My one and only complaint with the movie was that the flashing lights in some scenes gave me a migraine.The movie is based on the book “Ready Player One” that was first published in 2011 and was the debut novel for author Ernest Cline. Th e movie follows the main character named Wade Watts in the dystopian future of 2044. In the fi lm, society goes through some tough times which causes the public to wish to forget about their problems rather than deal with them. A man by the name of James Halliday creates a fully interactive virtual reality world that he called the Oasis. Before he died, he left  an Easter egg in the game that would grant the fi rst person to fi nd it ownership of the Oasis and fortune with it. In the movie, Wade and millions of other players search for the elusive prize and are willing to do anything  in both the real world and virtual world – to fi nd it. Th e movie’s visual eff ects are remarkable. As the majority of the fi lm takes place in a fi ctional virtual reality world, the fi lmmakers used computer generated imagery (CGI) to create just about everything. The players traverse the Oasis represented as personal characters called avatars. The avatars take on whatever form the player chooses. Th e settings and activities found in the Oasis varies heavily from minor games and activities to life or death struggles for the greatest items in the game. Th e visual eff ects go all in as there are no details left unattended. Th e settings in the Oasis are seamless as they are fi lled with background characters of great variety.Th e cast does an amazing job for the fi lm. Wade Watts, played by Tye Sheridan, is spot on. He does great in portraying  a young adult in his twenties who plays a game as much as possible in hopes of fi nding the grand prize at the end of the game.Actress Olivia Cooke does a great job playing the role of  Art3mis,  a woman who desires above all else to find the prize for her own personal reasons and not for the fame and glory that comes with it.Th e most appealing character is Noland Sorrento, played by Ben Mendelsohn. Sorrento is the head of operations at a multinational corporation and the main antagonist of the story who also wishes to fi nd the prize as well. His reason is to become the owner of the Oasis so that he could monetize the game and become wealthier for it.“Ready Player One” exceeded my own expectations. I’ll admit the only reason I was curious enough to see it was inclusion of characters from other video games and movies. It is not oft en that one sees Mecha-Godzilla going head to head with the Iron Giant or other similar nerd-gasmic moments.Disregarding that, the story was solid and straight forward that was helped along by the well-chosen cast and the stunning visual effects. It was a satisfying movie that had me on the edge of my seat.Th e Art Ark Gallery displayed colorful and creative eco-friendly art to show that artists can create in healthier ways.The pictures and artwork in the gallery were almost all related to nature. Th ere were pieces that resembled sea creatures, in addition to pictures of animals and insects by diff erent photographers. Th ese pictures were displayed for the pleasure of others and on sale as well.Danielle Siembieda is the founder of Art Inspector: Saving the Earth by Changing Art. Th e art exhibit featured a lecture by Siembieda.“Th is is where we are as artists, we have limited resources,” Siembieda said. “Artists are not tracking their carbon footprint.”  Art Inspector is a social project created to help build an eco-art economy. According to Siembieda’s website, an art inspector is a certifi ed agent who examines the environmental impact of art process and practice.Siembieda’s job is to examine artists’ workspace in hopes that they are not in a hazardous environment. When an artist passes, they are put on a public healthy art list. Siembieda suggests that new student artists should be aware of the products they will be using.“Start to build a community, ask a lot of questions and start to take on healthy habits when they’re making work so that in the long-run they don’t have any negative health eff ects as they are working, which I think is something people forget along the way,” Siembieda advises students. “As you do this for a long time, it’s not something you see immediately.”  Paintings can be made with acrylic, watercolor or oil paints. Siembieda said an example of eco-friendly creations is to not use turpentine but instead to use linseed oil. Linseed oil is a good substitute when artists work on oil paintings.Turpentine is a pungent oil distilled from tree resin that’s oft en used when mixing paints. Linseed oil is also known as fl axseed oil and comes from the dried seeds of fl ax plants.“I think it was really interesting how she was talking about the life cycle of making art,” Asami Akinaga, art instructor at Community School of Music and Art, said. “I never really thought about all of the ways that I am impacting the environment during that process. It was really eye-opening thinking about that.” Akinaga said she already started working to decrease her carbon footprint. She tries not to work with many plastics or turpentine. Akinaga said she would like to switch to a more eco-friendly paint medium in the future.“Be more conscious and be more aware,” Akinaga said. “I think that it is important to learn more about materials and what you’re using not just for your own safety but also because you’re going to use a lot throughout your lifetime and that is going to impact the environment.” Alfred Ventura is another environmentally-conscious artist who attended the event. He is a ceramic lad tech from San Diego Grossmont College.Painting and drawing are some of the many art forms, but being a ceramist lab has its risks Ventura said. In the past, ceramists used lead-based clay, which was very toxic. People have died from that from the fumes overtime because of lead poisoning.“I’m usually making sure everything is well ventilated,” Ventura said.Ventura suggests artists to do a lot of research before they commit so that artists can choose the correct and eco-friendly tools they will need for their work. He said will benefit artists in the long-run. OPINIONsjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 20184Scientifi cally and biologically, pineapple is an elite pizza topping. For some strange reason, hating pineapple as a pizza topping has become a popular debate. Pineapple is a soft , juicy, tart fruit that can be eaten in many diff erent ways, all of which are delicious, and eating it on pizza is no diff erent. Taste can be broken down into fi ve diff erent fl avor categories: sweet, salty, bitter, sour and savory. Pineapple pizza directly satisfi es each of these categories.Additionally, our taste buds have the ability to taste multiple diff erent combinations simultaneously. We enjoy salty and sweet combos like chocolate covered pretzels. Many Asian foods combine tastes like sweet and sour. Traditional Indian food combines sweet with bitter in certaincurry recipes. Pineapple pizza is no diff erent. Pineapple alone has a unique mix of sweet, sour and bitter. Combine that with a sodium-fi lled savory tomato sauce and cheese on top of a warm crust and your taste buds will be in heaven. A study done by Foodler, a DoorDash-like delivery service, revealed that pineapple is one of the 10 most common pizza toppings in the United States and Canada. Neither Basil nor tomato cracked the list, so I’m sorry margherita pizza fans, but more people agree that pineapple compliments pizza better than your favorite toppings. It is not just our taste buds that appreciate the complexity of a pineapple pizza, but our body desires it. In a New York Times article Daniel Lieberman, a Biological Sciences professor at Harvard, wrote “that millions of years ago humans evolved to crave sugar because it was a rich source for energy, which our hunter-gatherer ancestors needed to store in order to survive.” Th e pineapple on my pizza is satisfying millions of years worth of evolution. Furthermore, pineapple contains vitamin B2, which helps with energy and reaction times. While pizza itself may be greasy and unhealthy, if you throw some pineapple slices on it, you are providing your body with the energy you need to continueyour day. Now I understand that pineapple is a wet fruit and too much moisture from pizza toppings can ruin the crust. However, this is really only an issue if you cover the pizza with too much pineapple. Overloading a pizza with too much of any topping can be disastrous. Have you ever seen a meat lovers pizza with too much meat? Th e toppings become too heavy, forcing the cheese to slide off , leaving you with saucy bread. Anchovies are a well-known pizza topping that no one dismisses or debates. People know they are too salty and have that pungent fi shy smell that make your eyes water. However if someone says they put anchovies on their pizza they don’t get the same look of disgust as pineapple pizza enthusiasts receive. Personally, my go-to pizza contains chicken, black olives and pineapple. It’s a perfect mixture of sweet, salty and tart with protein added in. You may be reading this and think, “Who is this guy trying to tell me to eat pineapple with my pizza?” I get that, so take Chloe Kim’sword instead. Th e Olympic snowboarder who won a gold medal in Pyeongchang went on Th e Late Late Show with James Corden and told chef Gordon Ramsey, who famously trashes the idea of pineapple pizza, “I don’t want to off end you with this one, but I love Hawaiian pizza.” If you can’t trust the opinion of an Olympian, whose opinion can you trust? Th e debate is over, pineapple belongs on pizza, period. Th ere is no logical reason that pineapple is any worse on than any other topping.People need to stop using the word ‘gay’ as a slurWe have all said it growing up.Some people continue to say it, but it needsto stop.You are with your bros having a good time and joking around when it just slips out of their mouths.“That’s so gay,” and using “gay” as a negative or mean way, like it is an insult.Some people use it as a way to express whether they do not like something or they think something is weird. Th at is not okay. Th is way of speaking needs to end.Originally, it was positive and lighthearted and meant happy. Now, gay is a word used when a person falls in love or has attraction to someone of the same sex or gender.It was used in pop culture back in the day, making appearances in many songs, showsand movies.In the popular musical and movie “West Side Story,” the character Maria sings a song called “I Feel Pretty.”She feels happy and pretty because she is loved by another character, Tony.As the song starts off, “I feel pretty / Oh, so pretty / I feel pretty, and witty and gay / And I pity any girl who isn’t me today.”It was a fun and positive word, so why has it taken such abad turn?You do not hear anyone saying “that’s so straight,” and that is because I feel like we’ve grown up in this homophobic society. We grow up and are taught this “normal” way of thinking when we are kids.We are taught that a man meets a woman, they fall in love, get married, and have kids, etc.We are taught being straight is normal and anything other than that is wrong.Sunnyvale resident Brandi Barbosa-Brown identifi es as bisexual and said that coming out was extremely hard because of her upbringing.“Growing up in a Catholic family, our ‘goal’ with relationships was that you were suppose to marry a good man or someone of the opposite sex,” Barbosa-Brown said. “So when I realized that I was bisexual, I never brought it up to my family because we always used to make fun of our other family members who were gay.”Barbosa-Brown said she didn’t want to be the butt of those kinds of jokes or to be looked down upon in her family. Growing up in her family and knowing their views about the LGBTQ community made it extremely hard for her to come out.People who use the word gay in that negative way need to understand that it is unkind and insensitive.Imagine being made fun of or looked down upon because of being straight and growing up in that kind of society.LGBTQ youth report higher rates of anti-LGBTQ harassment and bullying than straight youth. But not every person who is the target of anti-LGBTQ bullying is LGBTQ, according to the Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network. Many who are bullied are targeted because of how their sexual orientation is perceived or because they do not conform to someone else’s expectations about gender.It is 2018 and people need to stop being so closed-minded.We have to be more sensitive to other’s feelings and recognize that our words can really hurt others and have negative effects.Pineapple is a premier topping that belongs on pizzasWilliam dela CruzSTAFF WRITERFollow Ben on Twitter@thereelbstein Follow William on Twitter@liamotsdReality television showsdiscourage teen pregnancyTh e hit MTV show “16 and Pregnant”  fi rst aired in 2009. Th e show followed a group of young teens throughout theirpregnancy journeys. Th e network  later aired a spin-off  series called “Teen Mom.” Since then, other shows like “Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant” and TLC’s “Unexpected” have appeared on TV screens. Some people may think these shows promote teen pregnancy, but in reality they do the exact opposite. Yes, these teens are in the spotlight, but these shows don’t glorify anything about being young and pregnant. Th ey show the harsh realities teen mothers face when they have a child in high school. Th e shows also aim to encourage girls to enjoy their teenage years before deciding to have a baby. “I think most people would be discouraged aft er seeing those shows because it shines the light on abusive relationships, fi nancial issues and forced marriages,” marketing senior Camila Ruiz said. “All these realities are highlighted more than the happiness from actually giving birth to the child.”“16 and Pregnant” follows young expectant mothers through their everyday lives. As the girls progress in their pregnancies, viewers see that normal high school activitiesbecome diffi  cult. When it comes time to shop for prom, the girls are limited to what dresses they can buy because of their sizes. It shows some girls breaking down in the dressing room because they feel “huge” and don’t fi t into any ofthe dresses. Some of the girls never end up attending their proms because they were embarrassed about what their peers would say to them. Other girls who played sports eventually had to sit out. Th e girls missed out on a lot of what it meant to be a teenager and had to grow up really fast. I remember the fi rst time I watched “16 and Pregnant” I knew that I didn’t want that to be me in high school.  Th e show sends a strong message to its young viewers to wait until adulthood to have a child. By no means is the show trying to say that getting pregnant and having a child is wrong, but bringing a child into the world when you’re still a child yourself may not be the most responsible thing. Th ese new moms have to fi gure out how to pay for the medical expenses, diapers, formula and countless other expenses. Th ey have to stay up through the night on school nights to tend to their babies and only have the support of boyfriends and family members if they’re lucky.“I don’t think that shows like ‘16 and Pregnant’ encourage pregnancies, but they defi nitely make teen pregnancies look more appealing,” Leland High School senior Brooke Darrough said. “Instead of showing the consequences and struggles of teen pregnancies, I feel like they highlight all the drama and humor in a positive way.”A study done in 2012 by researchers at Indiana University showed that the backgrounds of viewers aff ected how they reacted to “16 and Pregnant” and“Teen Mom.” Th e study found that, “the shows didn’t infl uence the girls’ sexual choices so much as their relationship with their parents and background in sex education did.” While some people like to blame these shows for glorifying teen pregnancies, it is highly unlikely that girls who have gone through sex education will become so infl uenced by watching these shows that they would try to get pregnant. Th ese shows teach teens that having a child isn’t easy and to enjoy all the perks of being young while they still can.

For far too long we humans have used animals as test subjects in experiments that can potentially put their lives at risk.Animals have been subjected to testing since the 18th century, according to About Animal Testing.More than 100 million animals suffer and die each year in the United States in inhumane drug, food, chemical and cosmetic tests, according to the People for Ethical Treatment ofAnimals (PETA).Being used in medical exercises and medical experiments are two other practices where millions of animals die each year in testing. Examples of cruelty are forcing rats and mice to inhale toxic fumes, force-feeding dogs pesticides and dripping corrosive chemicals into rabbits’ ears, according to PETA. Some countries including Russia, Turkey and Brazil require one-year tests on dogs to study the toxicity of pesticides, accordingto PETA.Though the United States has the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), which regulates the care and use of animals in research, testing, teaching, exhibition, transport and by dealers, the act only provides minimal protection for certain speciesof animals.However, the New England Anti-vivisection Society says that the law excludes the coverage of rats, mice and birds that are bred for research, which accumulates to approximately 90 to 95 percent of animals tested in laboratories. This society also says the law provides no coverage for cold-blooded animals such as fish, reptiles and amphibians and also does not cover farm-raised animals that are used for agricultural research such as cows and pigs. Though the AWA does cover dogs, cats, nonhuman primates, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits and other warm-blooded animals, this only makes up 10 percent of the animals being tested on in laboratories and the Gabriel MungaraySTAFF WRITERFollow Gabriel on Twitter@SJSneakerheadOur government should look to ban animal testinglaw only sets minimal standards for housing, feeding, handling and veterinary care.I understand we have had scientific breakthroughs because of animal testing. This includes in 1922 when the use of animal testing allowed for insulin to be isolated from dogs as discovered by Nobel Prize-winning scientists Frederick Banting and John Macleod. The scientific breakthrough of allowing insulin to be isolated from dogs to keep them alive longer if they are suffering from diabetes really hits home.I am a dog owner that currently has a dog that has been suffering from diabetes for eight years and needs two shots of insulin each day.Despite these breakthroughs through animal testing, there are now new solutions to get around using animal testing. One different method of practice is in vitro testing.According to PETA, one example of in vitro testing is “organs-on-chips” that were created at Harvard’s Wyss Institute that contain human cells that are grown to mimic the structure and function of human organs and organ systems.Instead of the use of animals in disease research, drug testing and toxicity testing, these chips can be used and have shown to replicate human physiology, diseases and drug responses more accurately than other animal experiments.As of right now, in vitro testing is primarily used for the detection of specific toxic properties in drugs and chemicals. There is no timetable as of when it may replace animal testing, according to U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health.  Having the new research and new technology that has been proven more accurate than animal tested experiments, the government should work to ban animal testing completely.For far too long we humans have used animals as test subjects in experiments that can potentially put their lives at risk.ILLUSTRATION BY MARCI SUELA | SPARTAN DAILYSPORTSsjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, APRIL 3, 20186Twenty-four National Football League (NFL) teams had scouts in attendance at San Jose State’s Pro Day to watch the eight participants go through different exercises and drills. The main focus was on the lone junior, inside linebacker Frank Ginda. Just one week after being in a car accident where he was hit by a drunk driver, Ginda proved that he was not in enough pain to stop him from competing.Ginda had to get 10 stitches and said he felt shoulder pain but still showed off the work ethic that helped him lead the nation in tackles last season. Ginda started the event inside SJSU’s Koret Athletic Training Center by putting up 29 repetitions on the bench press, the most in the day and more than any linebacker tallied during the NFL’s scouting combine earlier this month. “It doesn’t matter what pain I’m in,” Ginda said. “I’m still going to come out here, compete and show that I’m reliable.” The linebacker competed in all six drills, running his 40-yard dash in 4.72 seconds, a 4.28-second shuttle run and a 6.97-second 3-cone drill. Ginda reached 33 inches on his vertical leap and 9 feet 6 inches in the broad jump.“I came out here and gave it my all and the numbers speak for themselves,” Ginda said. “My main goal is to help out my family and I feel like after how I performed, it’s going to help me.”Ginda was not the only Spartan who impressed scouts. Cornerback Jermaine Kelly Jr. also turned heads by pumping out 20 repetitions on the bench and running the fastest 40-yard dash of the day at 4.47 seconds.“A lot of scouts told me after my press and 40 that I really made a name for myself,” Kelly Jr. said. “I came in as confident as ever, I always trust in my coaches and in my training. I was prepared.” Kelly Jr. continued to tear up the turf, running an 11.88-second 60-shuttle, a 34 inches vertical and a 10 foot 5 inch broad jump.“To come out here and give it one last go on Spartan Field was awesome,” Kelly Jr. said. Ginda and Kelly are both expected to be late round draft picks in the upcoming NFL draft at the end of April. Punter Michael Carrizosa was the only special teams player to compete in front of scouts, displaying both power in his long distance punts and field goal attempts, as well as his accuracy by dropping multiple punts inside the five-yard line. Carrizosa could be given an opportunity to join an NFL team after he impressed scouts with a punt that bounced and froze inside the one yard marker.“There’s not another punter like me,” Carrizosa said. “I am not a normal punter. I go out there and give it everything I’ve got. I treat every single game like it’s my life.” Linebacker William Ossai, defensive backs Andre Chachere and Maurice McKnight and offensive linemen Chris Gonzalez and Jeremiah Kolone also participated in select events during the Pro Day.Spartans tear turf during the 2018 Pro DayKAVIN MISTRY | THE SPEARSan Jose State cornerback Jermaine Kelly Jr. performs in the broad jump at Pro Day on March 23.

Follow Ben on Twitter@thereelbstein Giants look to avenge last season’s disaster The San Francisco Giants are looking to improve on what was described as a disaster after finishing tied for the worst record last season. The team’s batting ranked near the bottom out of 30 Major League Baseball teams. The Giants ranked 29th in team batting, which includes home runs, RBI’s, and batting average. It also ranked last in total home runs with 128 and 29th in total team RBI’s with 612, according to ESPN.The team’s pitching ranked 16th out of the 30 teams, according to ESPN, which was considered as one of the Giants’ biggest downfalls last season. Starting pitcher Madison Bumgarner injured himself in early April in a dirt bike accident that left him with a Grade 2 AC joint sprain in his shoulder and broken ribs. This was a setback for the team as the Giants only won 64 games last season, tying the Detroit Tigers.“I’m hoping they make it to the playoffs this year, especially after last year,” kinesiology senior Ramy Salem said.Kinesiology senior Jacob Manriquez shared similar feelings on the Giants making the playoffs.“Definitely looking for them to make the playoffs because they didn’t make it last year,” Manriquez said.The team made two major acquisitions this off-season, trading for third baseman Evan Longoria from the Tampa Bay Rays and outfielder Andrew McCutchen from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Manriquez believes McCutchen and Longoria will play huge roles on the team this season.“They look like promising players,” Manriquez said. “They will have some type of impact that help improve the team’s offense.”  As far as being good team players in the clubhouse, Salem believes McCutchen and Longoria will bring good team morale to the team.“They are good players and good character guys that will gel really well with everyone on the team and also bring good team chemistry just like in previous years,” Salem said. “I’m kind of nervous because they are kind of old, but I think they will have a good impact on the team overall.”The team is returning three starters from last year’s rotation which includes Bumgarner, Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija.  Though the Giants will be without Bumgarner and Samardzija for several weeks to start the season. Bumgarner suffered a fractured left hand during a spring training game and Samardzija is nursing a pectoral strain.  Starting pitchers Ty Blach and Chris Stratton filled the final two spots. Both Blach and Stratton pitched for the Giants last year in spot starts, but neither have been consistent enough to stay in the rotation like they will need to this year. Kinesiology sophomore Noel Ramirez said he has faith in the pitching staff after last season’s struggles.“With Madison Bumgarner coming back, the rotation should improve and I have high expectations for them,” Ramirez said. As an early expectation of their record at the end of the season, the Giants should finish the year 84-78 which would have them fighting for a Wild Card spot in the National League playoffs as the two Wild Card teams last year finished with 93 and 87 wins respectively.The Giants started the 2018 season splitting the opening series on the road against their rivals the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Giants won the first two games of the series by the score of 1-0. I In each of the first two games, Giants’ starting second baseman Joe Panik had a solo home run scoring the Giants only runs in the series. The Giants went on to lose the next two games of the series by scores of 5-0 and 9-0 and new acquisitions McCutchen and Longoria finished with a combined 1-31 hitting in the series.Follow Gabriel on Twitter@SJSneakerheadSPORTS COLUMNLast week’s Spartan Sports Notes\u0002 For the fi rst time in SJSU history, the San Jose State gymnastics team won its second consecutive Mountain Pacifi c Sports Federation title with a school record of 195.975 team score.\u0002 SJSU softball went 3-0 over spring break in a series against UNLV.\u0002 Track and fi eld athletes Jeanette Zambrano and Jennifer Sandoval broke their previous school records in the 3,000-meter steeplechase and the 10,000 meters.\u0002 SJSU baseball ended its fi ve-game losing streak with a win over Air Force during spring break.
