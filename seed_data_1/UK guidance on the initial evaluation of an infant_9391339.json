If there is any doubt, the case should be dis-cussed with the regional team. In most cases, particularly in the caseof the newborn, the paediatric endocrinologist within the regionalDSD team acts as the first point of contact. The underlying patho-physiology of DSD and the strengths and weaknesses of the tests thatcan be performed should be discussed with the parents and affectedyoung person and tests undertaken in a timely fashion. This clinicianshould be part of a multidisciplinary team experienced in manage-ment of DSD and should ensure that the affected person and parentsare as fully informed as possible and have access to specialist psycho-logical support. Finally, in the field of rare conditions, it is impera-tive that the clinician shares the experience with others throughnational and international clinical and research collaboration.(Received 8 February 2011; returned for revision 6 March 2011;finally revised 6 April 2011; accepted 12 April 2011)Introduction and development of guidanceDisorders of sex development (DSD) are a wide range of conditionswith diverse pathophysiology1 that most often present in thenewborn or the adolescent. Affected newborns usually present withatypical genitalia whereas adolescents present with atypical sexualdevelopment during the pubertal years. These clinical situations canoften be difficult to manage, particularly in those cases where thesex of rearing is uncertain. Establishing a dialogue and building rap-port with the affected child and the parents, evaluating the child andthen developing a logical, as well as pragmatic, plan for investiga-tions are central to the initial approach and ongoing management.The consensus that was reached in Chicago in 2005 on thegeneral principles of managing patients with DSD represented ahistoric milestone for international and multidisciplinary collabo-ration in this area.2,3 Some areas of care such as the initial approachto evaluating the infant or young person with suspected DSD werenot covered in detail as that was beyond the scope of the exercise.Guidance on the initial evaluation of a complex condition is oftencoloured by local provision of health care, and it was felt that reach-ing a consensus at a national, United Kingdom, level may be themost effective means of proceeding further. A UK DSD taskforcewas formed in March 2009 under the auspices of the Society forEndocrinology, and it was agreed that the remit of this groupwould be to concentrate on guidance on the initial evaluation pro-cess and the diagnostic approach rather than the clinical manage-ment of the condition once a provisional or definitive diagnosis hasbeen reached. This guidance would be aimed at a range of clinicalprofessionals who encounter newborns and adolescents with DSDand its purpose would not be to simply act as a manual but to har-monize good clinical practice. Stakeholder professional societiesand clinical professionals who could represent these societies wereidentified and approached to join the group as were members oftwo patient representative groups. These group members tookresponsibility for individual sections and based their opinion onobservational studies and expert opinion and the whole group con-sidered each draft. After completion, the guidelines were subject toopen external review by the involved professional societies andtheir members as well as patient group representatives.

All members ofthe group have approved the final draft of the guidance.Themultidisciplinary teamOptimal care for infants and adolescents with DSD requires anexperienced multidisciplinary team (MDT) that should be accessi-ble through regional centres. The team may exist as a clinical net-work with links between more than one specialist centre. As aminimum standard, the clinical team should include specialists inendocrinology, surgery and/or urology, clinical psychology/psychi-atry, radiology, nursing and neonatology. For infants with sus-pected DSD, this team should develop a plan for clinicalmanagement with respect to diagnosis, sex assignment and treat-ment options before making any recommendations to the parents.In addition, the clinical team should have links to a wider MDTthat consists of specialists from adult endocrinology, plastic sur-gery, gynaecology, clinical genetics, clinical biochemistry, adultclinical psychology, social work and, if possible, to a clinical ethicsforum (Table 1).4 Ideally, discussions with the family are lead byone professional, and in most situations, particularly in the case ofthe newborn, the endocrinologist assumes the role of clinical leadand oversees the timely involvement of other members of the team.However, the core composition of the team for each affected per-son and family will vary according to DSD type, family need or par-ent preference, local resources, developmental context and locationas well as the age of the person. The parents and the young personshould be informed of the range of help that is available from theMDT and should be provided with contact details of these person-nel. Ongoing communication with the family’s primary care physi-cian is important, and consent issues in relation to sharinginformation outside of the hospital setting should be discussedwith parents and young person. The team has a responsibility toeducate other healthcare staff and should have a forum to meet reg-ularly, in the context of a clinic and an educational meeting whereit can review and discuss its own performance. Audit of clinicalactivity, research studies, building collaborative working partner-ships with other DSD teams and attendance at joint clinics andeducation events are crucial if knowledge and information sharingis to be optimized across MDT teams. Transfer of care for the ado-lescent should be organized with the MDT operating in an environ-ment comprising specialists with experience in adolescent care.5Psychological support for the affected person andfamilyEarly psychological input, provided by a specialist clinical psychol-ogist with experience of supporting people with DSD and their par-ents, will allow the latter to examine and understand their earlyemotional reactions as well as explore present and future worries,adjust to the period of uncertainty during the diagnosis processand facilitate inclusion in informed decision making about them-selves or their child.6,7 The clinical psychologist is also well placedto assess how well the family is coping and functioning, assess andfacilitate the bonding of the parents with the infant, and, in the caseof the young person, perform an assessment of gender identity,Table 1.

As a minimum, the parents of every newbornwith suspected DSD where there has been a delay in sex assignmentshould be offered clinical psychology input. In addition, alladolescents with a newly diagnosed DSD or existing DSD requiringmedical or surgical attention should be routinely offered clinicalpsychology input in addition to any support offered to their par-ents or wider family. The point of transfer from paediatric to adultservices offers an ideal opportunity for a routine assessment of theneed for clinical psychology input.Discussions with parents and young people need to occur onmultiple occasions in a quiet and peaceful setting, with enoughtime for the family and MDT to develop a shared understanding ofinvestigations, results, diagnosis, treatments and the value of ongo-ing psychological support for both themselves and/or their child.The pace of how information is shared should be set by the family,and issues of confidentiality discussed and respected.8 Parents’ andyoung people’s initial recollections of conversations with profes-sionals may have a long-lasting effect on them and their relation-ship with their affected child and health professionals.9 The use ofphrases such as ‘differences’ or ‘variations’ in sex development mayhelp to introduce the concept of the range of variation that mayoccur in sex development. A record of early discussions, either asaudiotapes or a letter, which is shared between the parents andother immediate members of the MDT and the general practitionermay be helpful. Use of drawings and written material during dis-cussion and a list of websites and support groups are useful aids forfamilies.Parents and young people need to be aware that the managementof the condition will require a stepwise approach that first targetsshort-term goals and then long-term goals that achieve optimallong-term well-being. It is very likely that families’ decisions will beshaped by their own expectations, experiences and their under-standing of sex and gender roles within the religious and culturalcontext of their own social networks. The MDT should also beaware of how their own values and beliefs are played out in consul-tation with the family. Some parents may consider early genital sur-gery as a mechanism that could possibly protect their child fromthe risk of future stigma. This will require a thorough discussionwith several members of the MDT team including the clinical psy-chologist, surgeons, gynaecologist and nurses so that the parentsare fully informed around the controversies around undertaking orwithholding early genital surgery.10 Parents and young people willneed support and guidance about how to share news following thebirth of their child/diagnosis and manage the social challenges theymay face at this time.8,11The role of the support groupSupport groups can provide ongoing support to parents and theaffected individual, including opportunities to gather and exploreinformation, promote autonomy and build knowledge and self-confidence regarding the diagnosis of DSD. For parents, gathering,using and questioning information will shape their understandingas they often act as the advocate for their child or young person andtherefore need to be fully informed about DSD practice, short- andlong-term outcomes of treatments and health risks and psychologi-cal challenges for their child. Support groups can provide a rangeof such information via websites and newsletters as well as throughphone helplines and group meetings for both families and profes-sionals.9 They can also work in collaboration with the MDT to helpfamilies as well as affected people in seeking appropriate medicalcare and improve patients’ understanding of their condition as wellas the reasons for medical therapy.6 Alongside the formal psycho-logical support provided by the specialist clinical psychologist, sup-port groups can also offer invaluable peer support to families andindividuals affected by DSD. By being in touch with others with asimilar condition and belonging to a support group, people cangain a sense of empowerment and the whole experience may alsonormalize a condition which may have previously been perceivedas a source of stigma and shame.12 Healthcare professionals rely onsupport groups for guidance on the development of healthcarestrategy as well as for providing the opportunity to interact withaffected people at national support group meetings and confer-ences.13 Contact details of support groups should be supplied asroutine as part of any written information. It is possible that fami-lies may prefer to talk to other local families affected in a similarway and regional services should attempt to create a local pool ofhelpers and explore locally organized support and education days.Which newborn should be investigated and howextensively?If the appearance of the external genitalia is sufficiently ambiguousto render sex assignment impossible or the phenotype is not consis-tent with prenatal genetic tests, then de facto, extensive investiga-tion is required. However, the extent of genital ambiguity maydepend on the expertise of the observer, and prior to presentationto a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is oftenassigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing isnot immediately clear to those present at the child’s birth. The birthprevalence of genital anomalies may be as high as one in 300births14 but the birth prevalence of complex anomalies that maylead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination may be as lowas one in 5000 births.15Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous, in the clinicalsituation, infants can often be divided into those who areTable 1.

Faisal Ahmed et al.\u0002 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Clinical Endocrinology, 75, 12–26apparently a boy with atypical genitalia and those who are appar-ently a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is very important tobear in mind that the same girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia(CAH) may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or anapparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluatingthese infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia thatrequire examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscr-otal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallusand the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the realsite of the urinary meatus may, sometimes, only become clear onsurgical exploration.16 These external features can be individuallyscored to provide an aggregate score, the external masculinizationscore (EMS; Fig. 1).17 Routine systematic examination of 423 con-secutive, apparently healthy, term newborn boys revealed that 412(98%) had the maximum EMS of 12, 10 had an EMS of 11 and only1 of 423 had an EMS of <11.17 In boys with genital anomalies, achromosomal anomaly may be present in approximately 3% ofthose with isolated cryptorchidism, 7% of those with hypospadiasand 13% of those with a combination of cryptorchidism and hypo-spadias.18 In infants with proximal hypospadias (penoscrotal, scro-tal, perineal), detailed biochemical and molecular studiesperformed a decade ago revealed a likely cause in 31% of cases.19With advances in biochemical and molecular techniques, it isunclear whether the diagnostic yield is even greater now.Infants with suspected DSD who require further clinical evalua-tion and need to be considered for investigation by a specialistshould include those with isolated perineal hypospadias, isolatedmicropenis, isolated clitoromegaly, any form of familial hypospa-dias and those who have a combination of genital anomalies withan EMS of <11. This will avoid unnecessary detailed investigationsinto boys with isolated glandular or mid-shaft hypospadias andboys with unilateral inguinal testis. The co-existence of a systemicmetabolic disorder, associated malformations or dysmorphic fea-tures would lower the threshold for investigation as would a familyhistory of consanguinity, stillbirths, multiple miscarriages, fertilityproblems, genital abnormalities, hernias, delayed puberty, genitalsurgery, unexplained deaths and the need for steroid replacement.In addition, maternal health and drug exposure during pregnancyand the pregnancy history itself may hold key information.In all infants with ambiguous genitalia and/or bilateral impalpa-ble gonads, a first tier of investigations should be undertaken todefine the sex chromosomes and delineate, by pelvic ultrasound,the internal genitalia and exclude life-threatening CAH – the com-monest cause of ambiguous genitalia of the newborn. This first tiershould, therefore, also include plasma glucose, serum 17OH-pro-gesterone (17OHP) and serum electrolytes. Serum 17OHP is usu-ally unreliable before the age of 36 h, and in the salt-losing form ofCAH, serum electrolytes usually do not become abnormal beforeday 4 of life. The results of PCR or FISH analysis using Y andX-specific markers should be available within one working day andthe 17OHP results should be available with a maximum of twoworking days in all specialist DSD centres. In situations where thelevel of suspicion of CAH is very high and the infant needs immedi-ate steroid replacement therapy, further serum samples should becollected and stored before starting therapy. These should be of asufficient volume to assess 17OHP, testosterone, androstenedioneand, possibly, renin activity or concentration, in that order of pri-ority. At least one spot or 24-h urine sample (at least 5 ml) for aurine steroid profile should be collected before starting therapy.The results of these initial investigations shall often dictate the sec-ond tier of investigations.In an infant with impalpable gonads, a karyotype of 46,XX, a sig-nificantly elevated serum 17OHP and the presence of a uterus makeCAH because of 21-hydroxylase deficiency very likely. A urine ste-roid profile can confirm this diagnosis and can also identify otherrare forms of CAH that may also be associated with a raised17OHP in the newborn. In infants with sex chromosomes otherthan 46,XX, a second tier of investigations is necessary to determinethe presence of testes and the adequacy of androgen productionand action. These tests include measurement of serum anti-Mu¨lle-rian hormone (AMH), the human chorionic gonadotrophin(hCG) stimulation test, further detailed imaging and laparoscopy.Confirmation of a specific diagnosis will often require further bio-chemical identification of a defect in the androgen biosynthesispathway and detailed genetic analysis.Which adolescent should be investigated and howextensively?The initial assessment in an affected adolescent should be aimed atestablishing a relationship with the patient and starting the processof diagnosis. In adolescents with an existing DSD, transferring toadult services is an opportunity to review the diagnosis and con-sider further investigations. An appropriate hospital setting is veryimportant for the sensitive management of complex conditionswith full access to the necessary medical, nursing and psychologicalcare. Whilst the explanation of the diagnosis to the patient and thefamily is critical, this needs to be performed sensitively and care-fully and expert psychological input is essential.Adolescents may typically present with a suspected DSD in threeways – a girl with primary amenorrhoea (with or without breastdevelopment), a girl who virilizes at puberty or a boy with pubertaldelay (Fig. 2).

History should include a familyhistory and an assessment of co-existing chronic disease, exerciseand weight changes. Physical examination should include measure-ment of blood pressure, height and weight and assessment of sec-ondary sexual characteristics including clitoral enlargement.Vaginal examination to assess vaginal length is rarely indicatedwhen imaging is informative and should be clearly explained andperformed by a gynaecologist. An initial investigation screen shouldcomprise measurements of serum electrolytes, LH, FSH, prolactin,TSH, FT4, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedi-one, oestradiol, testosterone and transabdominal pelvic ultrasoundby sonographer who has experience of adolescent appearances.Raised gonadotrophins or an absent uterus in the presence of nor-mal breast development are indications for a karyotype.The appearance of clitoromegaly and hirsutism at puberty in thepresence of primary amenorrhoea is a classical presentation of two46,XY DSDs: 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3(17bHSD3) deficiency and 5a-reductase type 2 deficiency. It is lesstypical of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) which isusually associated with ambiguous genitalia at birth. In all theseconditions, Mu¨llerian structures will not be detectable. Also, inpartial gonadal dysgenesis and ovotesticular DSD, the mild clitoro-megaly that may have been present at birth may have been over-looked but becomes a more prominent feature at adolescence. Thedifferential diagnosis would also include CAH and androgen-secreting tumours of the ovary or adrenal gland; in all these cases,Mu¨llerian structures are present. Investigations include serummeasurements of LH, FSH, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS),SHBG, androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT)and 17OHP. A 24-h urine collection for urinary steroid profile(USP) will confirm 5a-reductase type 2 deficiency, CAH or adreno-cortical tumour. A pelvic ultrasound will assess the presence of auterus and determine the need for a karyotype.Although the commonest cause of delayed puberty is constitu-tional delay, all boys with delayed puberty who are over the age of14 years should be assessed. Overweight boys need careful exami-nation so that a buried penis is not mistaken for micropenis.Rarely, PAIS, a disorder of testosterone biosynthesis or mild formsof testicular dysgenesis, can present in this age group, especially ifthere is a history of hypospadias repair or orchidopexy. Investiga-tions include a bone age and serum measurements of LH, FSH, tes-tosterone and prolactin. For those with raised gonadotrophins,karyotype should be performed to exclude disorders such as Kline-felter’s syndrome (47,XXY and variants) or 45,X/46,XY mosaicism.The role of the clinical geneticistEstablishing a specific molecular diagnosis is helpful in clinicalmanagement of cases and in offering accurate genetic counsellingfor the family. However, the number of diagnostic gene tests thatare available in accredited DNA laboratories in the United King-dom or internationally is limited and costly. As recent develop-ments in DNA and chromosomal analysis accelerate biomedicalresearch, many techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependentprobe amplification (MLPA) and comparative genomic hybridiza-tion (CGH) have the potential to become routine in clinicalpractice. Next-generation DNA sequencing platforms will allowwhole-genome sequencing for rare diseases to become a reality at arealistic price.21,22 The clinical geneticist at the specialist DSD cen-tre is correctly placed to evaluate complex genetic syndromes andalso judge which technique is appropriate and cost-effective forFSH Uterus ultrasoundHypogonadotrophic hypogonadismHypothalamic amenorrhoeaGonadal dysgenesis 46XX – Ovarian failure              45X    – Turner syndrome  46XY  – Swyer syndromePrimary amenorrhoeaBreast development?46XY – AIS46XX – Disorders of mullerian devpt- PCOS                                   - Outflow obstructionDelayedLow or normal High Absent PresentNormalFig. 2 Approach to investigating adolescent girlswith primary amenorrhoea.16 S.

DNA can be stored indefinitely withconsent, so when further diagnostic testing opportunities arise,aliquots of DNA can be accessed, avoiding repeated venepuncture.If a molecular diagnosis is reached in a research laboratory, thenconfirmation of this result in an accredited laboratory should besought where possible, before disclosing results to the family. Closeinvolvement of the clinical genetics service can ensure that theMDT covers all aspects of genetic counselling including provisionof information to the family, the mode of inheritance of the disor-der and the choices or options available for dealing with this risk.Established links with the clinical genetics service are also usefulwhen considering prenatal testing or interventions such as steroidtherapy in CAH (Fig. 3).Assessment of anatomyExamination and assessment by a paediatric surgeon withexperience of DSD is critically important in the affected newborn.Combining expert physical examination with endoscopic visualiza-tion and radiological assessment can provide information on thelocation and state of the gonads, the urogenital sinus and Mu¨llerianstructures. During this initial assessment, the anatomy and drain-age of the renal tract should also be assessed.23,24Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging modality and shouldinclude the adrenals, kidneys, pelvis, inguinal regions and scrotumwhere appropriate. In the neonate, the uterus, ovaries and adrenalsshould be identifiable but the reliability is child and operatordependent. It should also be borne in mind that the presence of auterine structure does not guarantee later function, and intra-abdominal testes and streak gonads are difficult to identify ultraso-nography. In the adolescent, it is sometimes difficult to confirm thepresence of a prepubertal uterus by ultrasonography and there maybe a place for repeat imaging after a 6-month course of oestrogen.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for caseswhere ultrasonography has failed to delineate the relationship ofthe Mu¨llerian structures and where there are abnormalities of theurinary tract.

MRI can identifyextra-abdominal ectopic testes and the presence of the spermaticcords, but is of less value in trying to define the presence and char-acter of intra-abdominal testes or streak gonads. In adolescents,MRI can delineate structural anomalies such as hydrometrocolposor hydronephrosis and identify secretory tumours. In general, T1imaging of the upper abdomen in adolescents is not required unlessthere is an adrenal mass in which case contrast enhancement shallalso be required.25,26Nowadays, the ‘genitogram’ is not routinely performed for diag-nostic purposes. It has been superseded by endoscopic examinationof the genital tract (genitoscopy), which provides a more detailedand thorough assessment. However, at the time of surgery, stentscan be accurately placed in various structures to allow a morefocused radiological examination. These investigations need toprovide information on the length of the urogenital sinus, the asso-ciated Mu¨llerian structures and the relationship of the urethra andits sphincter. In 46,XX DSD, genitoscopy can assess the need fordrainage of both the bladder and Mu¨llerian structures and providea detailed assessment of the urogenital anatomy. In 46,XY DSD,endoscopic examination can be used to identify any Mu¨llerianremnants that arise from the posterior urethra.Genitoscopy can be augmented by laparoscopy, but this is notnecessary in all cases of DSD. It is a very effective method of visual-izing the internal sex organs and facilitates direct inspection, biopsyor excision of intra-abdominal gonads. However, as laparoscopycan only visualize intraperitoneal structures, Mu¨llerian remnantsdeep within the pelvis or closely attached to the bladder may not beseen. In 46,XY DSD, laparoscopy is clearly indicated in all infantswith impalpable testes where the gonads need to be identified andbrought down to the scrotum if possible. Laparoscopy can also beused in adolescents who present with a DSD. However, MRI maybe a more suitable first-line investigation for defining the anatomy.Steroid measurement and its interpretationSteroid hormone analysis is a vital component of the biochemicalevaluation but the method of analysis can have a significant impacton the result.27 Analysis is most often performed by nonextraction,nonchromatographic (direct) immunoassays on automated plat-forms and these are subject to concerns of analytical specificity.28,29Liquid chromatography linked with tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS) allows multiple analyte analysis from a single samplewhilst maintaining analytical specificity.30 Thus, in cases of DSD,plasma or serum steroids should be measured by either LC-MS/MSor immunoassays after organic solvent extraction. As these aremore labour intensive, there may be an impact on the turnaroundtime for results and on clinical decision making. Close communica-tion between the clinical and biochemistry personnel within theDSD team is vital to enable correct interpretation of laboratoryresults and awareness that results should be available in a timelymanner.Urinary steroid profile analysis by gas chromatography massspectrometry (GC-MS) provides qualitative and quantitative dataon excretion of steroid metabolites. It is ideal for detecting alteredsteroid metabolites, especially in cases of CAH where the activity ofa combination of steroidogenic enzymes can produce unusualmetabolites that can cross-react in traditional serum assays.31 Thediagnosis of rarer forms of CAH such as P450 oxidoreductase defi-ciency (ORD) is best established using urinary GC-MS analysis as itallows for concurrent determination of all adrenal-derived steroidmetabolites.32 As gonadotrophins, androgens and precursors, fluc-tuate markedly over the first few months of life and may lead to adiagnostically blind window, there is a place to consider an earlyneonatal collection as well as further samples at a later stage. Aurine sample can be frozen and stored for many years and may helpwith a review of the diagnosis at a later stage. USP is not appropri-ate for suspected cases of 5a-reductase type 2 deficiency until after3 months of age as diagnostic pairs of 5b to 5a reduced metabolitesare not detectable until then.Normally, infants, particularly boys, have significant changes insteroid and other endocrine hormone concentrations during thefirst 100 days of birth.28,33 In boys, serum testosterone and DHTmay initially be high at birth but decline to <1 nmol/l or undetect-able, respectively. Concentrations then rise from around day 30after birth to peak at day 70 before declining to normal prepubertalconcentrations.33 These normal variations may influence the inter-pretation of sex steroid and gonadotrophin measurements as wellas the results of the hCG stimulation test. Furthermore, the actualvalue for the hormone concentration will vary depending on theassay methodology.SerumAnti-Mu¨llerian hormoneAnti-Mu¨llerian hormone, also known as Mu¨llerian-inhibiting sub-stance (MIS), is strongly expressed in Sertoli cells from the time oftesticular differentiation to puberty and to a much lesser degree ingranulosa cells from birth to menopause and is widely used nowa-days to assess ovarian reserve.34 Published information on circulat-ing AMH concentrations have to be interpreted with cautionbecause of differences in the way immunoassays are standardizedand the units used for measurement. It is, therefore, important toliaise with the specialist clinical biochemist to ensure appropriatereference ranges are used for interpretation. In boys, AMH isdetectable at birth at much higher circulating concentrations thanin girls and these concentrations rise over infancy before graduallydeclining at puberty. Therefore, up to date, age-, sex- and method-related reference ranges are necessary for interpretation.35 In maleneonates, levels that are close to the lower end of the normal rangeshould be repeated later in infancy as they should rise further inboys with normal testes. As summarized in Table 2, measurementof AMH is a powerful tool to assess Sertoli cell activity in childrenwith suspected DSD and may also have a diagnostic utility in con-ditions associated with androgen deficiency or insensitivity(Table 2).36The human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation testStimulation with hCG allows the identification of functioning tes-ticular tissue as well as biosynthetic defects in testosterone synthesis(Fig. 4). However, it is an invasive test that should only beperformed as a second-line investigation after discussion with the18 S. Faisal Ahmed et al.\u0002 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Clinical Endocrinology, 75, 12–26paediatric endocrinologist in the regional DSD team. Most proto-cols for hCG stimulation in the United Kingdom use intramuscularhCG 1000–1500 units on three consecutive days.37 This can befollowed by further hCG stimulation with 1500 units on 2 days aweek for the following 2 weeks. In young infants and adolescents,3 days of hCG stimulation may be sufficient,38 and in the veryyoung infant with an intrinsically active gonadal axis, an hCG stim-ulation test may not be necessary if serial blood samples showraised serum testosterone concentrations. A testosterone responseto hCG may be labelled as normal if absolute testosterone concen-trations reach a level that is above the upper limit of the normalprepubertal range or rise by more than twice the baseline value. Asa minimum, other androgens that should be assessed include DHTand androstenedione. For these two metabolites, the post-hCG,day 4 sample is more important than the pre-hCG, day 1 sampleand there does not seem to be any additional benefit of analysing asample for these two metabolites on day 22, following prolongedhCG stimulation, if there are sufficient samples to analyse on day4.38 The day 22 sample that is collected for testosterone measure-ment should be stored and can be used to measure DHT or andro-stenedione if a sufficient sample was not available at day 4.In routine cases of XY DSD, a persistently low AMH may have ahigh predictive value for a low hCG-stimulated testosterone con-centration but a normal AMH has a low predictive value for a nor-mal hCG-stimulated testosterone value.35 These relationshipsbetween the two variables do not apply to cases of persistent Mu¨lle-rian duct syndrome where there is an intrinsic defect of AMH orthe AMH receptor. There is no evidence that a urine steroid profileor a serum AMH checked after hCG stimulation has any addeddiagnostic value. In the presence of a poor testosterone responsefollowing hCG stimulation, assessment of adrenal function by astandard short synacthen stimulation test should be considered inTable 2.

There is less experience as well as a lower demand for acorresponding test to assess ovarian tissue but recent reports ofovarian hormones following stimulation with FSH need to beexplored further.39,40 There is currently insufficient evidence to rec-ommend that everybody with XY DSD should have a synacthenstimulation test but clinicians should be aware of the clear associa-tion between some forms of DSD and primary adrenal insufficiencyand should consider thorough assessment of adrenal function inthose diagnoses where an association has already been describedand in those with any clinical suspicion of adrenal insufficiency,especially those with low steroid precursors on USP.XX DSD46,XX DSD can be classified into disorders of ovarian development,conditions with androgen excess and other syndromes, which areoften associated with other developmental abnormalities.Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the commonest cause of 46,XXDSD with ambiguous genitalia in the neonatal period or earlyinfancy and is characterized by androgen excess and a variablealteration in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid function and aspecific profile of steroid hormones.41,42 This profile can identifythe enzyme defects including deficiency of 21a-hydroxylase (90–95% of cases), 11b-hydroxylase (4–8% of cases), 3b-hydroxyster-oid dehydrogenase type 2 (3bHSD2; rare) and P450 oxidoreductase(unknown prevalence). P450 ORD biochemically manifests asapparent combined CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 deficiency, sometimesalso resembling CYP19A1 (aromatase) deficiency. Unlike otherforms of CAH, ORD is characterized by increased androgen con-centrations only during the prenatal and early neonatal period, butrapidly develop sex hormone deficiency. Further details of theseenzyme defects are outlined in Table 3.46,XX DSD also includes disorders of gonadal developmentincluding 46,XX ovotesticular DSD and 46,XX testicular DSD.46,XX ovotesticular DSD commonly presents at birth with ambigu-ous genitalia and progressive virilization during puberty. In con-trast, individuals with 46,XX testicular DSD usually have a normalmale phenotype and absent Mu¨llerian structures and are oftendiagnosed after karyotype analysis during work-up for infertility.In 46,XX testicular DSD, about 80–90% of patients will have Ychromosomal material including a translocated SRY gene, which isonly rarely detected in 46,XX ovotesticular DSD.

Although most cases of Mu¨llerian developmentdisorders are not associated with androgen excess, the presence ofthe latter, particularly in the adolescent, should alert the clinicianto a possible abnormality of the WNT4 gene.XY DSDwith low testosterone and low precursorsThe differential diagnosis of 46,XY DSD associated with low testos-terone and low precursors includes the following: high defects insteroid synthesis (steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein,P450side chain cleavage(scc) enzyme/CYP11A1, sometimes Smith-Lemli-Optiz/DHCR7); LH receptor defects (LHCGR); and partialand complete forms of gonadal (testicular) dysgenesis (Table 4).Of note, complete or partial combined 17a-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (CYP17A1) may also present with ‘low testosteroneand low precursors’ if DHEAS and androstenedione are the onlyintermediates measured. The actual diagnosis can be reached byassessment of adrenal function by measuring ACTH, ACTH-stim-ulated cortisol, PRA, DOC, corticosterone, aldosterone, measure-ment of D5 (pregnenolone, 17OHPreg) and D4 (progesterone,17OHP) precursors or urine steroid analysis. Isolated 17,20-lyasedeficiency and ORD might also be diagnosed by this approach.Proximal blocks (StAR, P450scc) in the pathway affect steroidogen-esis in the adrenal gland as well as the developing gonad.Luteinizing hormone receptor defects (‘Leydig cell hypoplasia’)typically result in elevated basal LH, hyperresponsive LH to GnRHstimulation, low precursors and testosterone, and impaired andro-gen response to hCG stimulation. No Mu¨llerian structures will bepresent and adrenal function is normal. A spectrum of phenotypeshas been reported including ambiguous genitalia and micropenis.In some cases, basal LH may not be elevated at times when theHPG axis is quiescent (6 months to late childhood).In complete gonadal dysgenesis (‘Swyer syndrome’), affectedpeople will usually have a female phenotype with intra-abdominalstreak gonads. In some situations, ovotestes or even undifferenti-ated gonadal tissue may be found.43–45 Mu¨llerian structures areusually present because of impaired AMH secretion in early foetallife. Androgens and their precursors will be low, LH elevated,depending on age, and a poor or absent testosterone response tohCG stimulation is seen. AMH concentrations will be low or unde-tectable and adrenal function is usually normal unless the underly-ing defect is in steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) or related adrenal orgonadal factors.Partial gonadal (testicular) dysgenesis can present with a spec-trum of phenotypes ranging from clitoromegaly, to ambiguousgenitalia or severe hypospadias. Mu¨llerian structures may or maynot be present, and testes of variable size and architecture are pres-ent along the path of descent. The biochemical profile is similar tocomplete gonadal dysgenesis, but generally less severe. If milddegrees of clitoromegaly in infancy are overlooked, a 46,XY childwith partial gonadal dysgenesis may first present at puberty withprogressive androgenization. Genetic analysis and associated fea-tures may be useful in defining the molecular aetiology of someforms of gonadal dysgenesis.46XY DSDwith low testosterone and high steroidprecursors46,XY DSD with low testosterone and increased precursors can becaused by several variants of CAH, namely by 17a-hydroxylase(CYP17A1) deficiency, ORD and 3bHSD2 deficiency, caused byinactivating mutations in the corresponding genes CYP17A1, PORand HSD3B2, respectively. In addition, 46,XY DSD with low testos-terone and increased precursors can typically be found in individu-als affected by 17bHSD3 deficiency, caused by HSD17B3 mutations(Table 4).Deficiency of CYP17A1 leads to CAH in about 1% of cases of46,XY DSD. Characteristically, affected individuals present withfemale genitalia and low DHEA, androstenedione and testosterone.There is an increase in mineralocorticoid synthesis, and althoughthere may be cortisol deficiency, this is rarely manifested, as corti-costerone can also bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor. InORD, sex steroids are characteristically low, sometimes low nor-mal, whilst pregnenolone and progesterone and their metabolitesaccumulate, as expression of the combined block of CYP21A2 andCYP17A1 activities. Although there is often a relative preponder-ance of mineralocorticoid over glucocorticoid metabolites inaffected cases, hypertension only manifests in adolescence or later.Although baseline glucocorticoid secretion is usually sufficient, inthe majority of cases, the stress response to ACTH is significantlyimpaired, requiring at least stress dose hydrocortisone cover or per-manent glucocorticoid replacement. 3b-HSD2 (also termed D4-D5isomerase) deficiency invariably leads to glucocorticoid deficiencyand as well as a variable degree of mineralocorticoid deficiency andits characteristic features are outlined in Table 4. 17b-HSD3 defi-ciency is responsible for the conversion of androstenedione to tes-tosterone in the gonad and has no effect on adrenalsteroidogenesis. Plasma steroids characteristically show increasedandrostenedione levels whilst testosterone levels are concurrentlylow, particularly after hCG stimulation. However, a low testoster-one to androstenedione ratio may also occur in cases of gonadaldysgenesis and the reliability of a low ratio in identifying 17b-HSD3 deficiency is unclear. In urine, the typical finding is anincrease in the androgen (and androstenedione) metabolites,androsterone (An) and etiocholanolone (Et), but it is unclearwhether this applies across all age groups.31XY DSDwith normal testosterone, normal precursorsand low DHTThe type 2 isoenzyme of 5a-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) is highlyexpressed in androgen-sensitive tissues47 and converts testosteroneto the more potent androgen, DHT, required for the developmentUK guidance on evaluation of DSD 21\u0002 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Clinical Endocrinology, 75, 12–26Table 4.

At birth, the external appearance of thegenitalia of an infant with SRD5A2 deficiency can range from acompletely female phenotype to a range of hypospadias severity orjust isolated micropenis. A positive family history is often presentin this autosomal recessive condition. In serum, the testosterone/DHT ratio following hCG stimulation usually exceeds 30:1. Ininfants over 3–6 months, the defect should be easily identifiablesimply on a urine sample which shows a decreased ratio of 5a:5b-reduced C21 and C19 steroids and thus can be reached in a childwho had early gonadectomy. Early diagnosis of this condition isimportant as the affected infant may need sex reassignment if ini-tially raised as a girl. In the infant raised as a boy, application oftopical DHT cream may be a method of assessing the potential ofthe genitalia to virilize over the longer term.XY DSDwith normal testosterone, normal precursorsand normal DHTA defect in androgen signalling is most likely due to dysfunction ofthe androgen receptor (AR) and mutations resulting in a completelack of function of the AR cause complete androgen insensitivitysyndrome (CAIS).48 This presents in the newborn infant as a dis-cordance between a female phenotype and a prenatal karyotype of46,XY, a postnatal check because of a positive family history, or asinguinal swellings in an otherwise normal girl. CAIS usually pre-sents in adolescence as primary amenorrhoea with normal breastdevelopment. The presence of pubic hair is often reported in CAISand should not be used to exclude the diagnosis. Mutations thatresult in some residual AR function and varying degrees of andro-genization cause PAIS. Although children with AIS typically havenormal testosterone and DHT response to hCG stimulation and anormal USP, some demonstrate a poor response to hCG stimula-tion.37,49 The serum AMH concentration is normal or may even beelevated. LH levels are increased in the face of normal or elevatedserum testosterone, reflecting a state of androgen resistance.36 Afamily history of X-linked inheritance is informative although one-third of cases are the result of spontaneous new mutations.A functional assessment of androgen sensitivity may includeassessing the clinical effect of a short course of testosterone appliedon the phallus or by the effect of systemic testosterone followinghCG stimulation. However, there is no consensus on the choice ofandrogen, dosage, method of administration, timing, duration oftreatment and the definition of a satisfactory response in thegrowth of the phallus. Androgen sensitivity can be also assessed bymeasuring change in SHBG, an androgen-responsive protein whichnormally decreases following androgen exposure. This fall in SHBGis absent in CAIS, variable in PAIS50 and difficult to interpret inyoung infants who have highly variable circulating SHBG. ARTable 4.

Theterm PAIS should be reserved for those children who have XY DSDand a pathogenic mutation in AR.Networks and registers for clinical care, audit andresearchIt is unrealistic to expect that every major clinical centre can possessa comprehensive, multidisciplinary DSD team as outlined earlier.Furthermore, in many cases, care at a local hospital may be moreappropriate for reasons of both convenience and necessity (forexample, adrenal crisis in CAH). For the less complex case of hypo-spadias, immediate multidisciplinary input may not be necessaryand initial discussion and explanation of the condition with the par-ents does not require urgent transfer of the baby at an emotionallysensitive period. Similarly, some investigations can also be per-formed at local centres that are affiliated to a regional centre. It is,however, important that all personnel who may be involved in thecare of an affected person have access to the regional DSD team andhave the opportunity to develop themselves professionally. Someregions have overcome these hurdles with the development of anational managed clinical network (http://www.sgan.nhsscot-land.com). A service model such as this ensures the provision of anequitable state-of-the-art service for all affected children and adoles-cents in a region. A formal organization allows a structured referralpathway within the region as well as beyond and provides the infra-structure for better long-term care of the patient as close to home aspossible. A network also facilitates the creation of nationally agreedprotocols for the care of the affected newborn, setting and monitor-ing of national standards of care, and rational utilization of otherservices such as clinical genetics and clinical biochemistry and pro-vides a forum for education and professional development.Research and audit are vital for the management of DSD, andclinical networks have a strong potential to drive these activities.The 2005 Consensus Workshop on DSD stressed the need for thecreation and maintenance of a database in centres of expertise.Clinical audit systems that collect information on clinical activityand outcome should be an integral component of national special-ist services. Such databases may exist at a less formal level in manyother regional centres and until recently have lacked internationaluniformity and the ability to crosstalk. A web-based register(https://tethys.nesc.gla.ac.uk/) has been approved by the UKNational Research Ethics Service as a multicentre research databasewhich does not require any further local research approvals butdoes require the approval of the patient or parent.52 This web-based register is currently helping the EuroDSD research pro-gramme and has the potential to address many unanswered ques-tions about long-term outcome in these rare conditions. Suchregisters of patients can also facilitate the development of local cir-cles of patients and parents with similar conditions who can sup-port each other.ConclusionThe rationale for investigating a newborn or an adolescent with asuspected disorder of sex development may include the need todetermine the sex of rearing, anticipate early medical problems,explain the aetiology to the young person and the parents of anaffected newborn and, finally, to develop a management plan thatleads to optimal long-term outcome. A rational and empathicapproach that relies on the skills and knowledge of the expertswithin the multidisciplinary team is essential for achieving thesegoals. An unequivocal diagnosis confirmed by biochemical andgenetic means remains elusive in many cases of disorders of sexdevelopment, particularly XY disorders of sex development. Thestepwise approach to reaching the final diagnosis needs to beexplained to parents and the most important goals of the initialperiod of assessment should be to support the affected person andthe parents, assign a sex of rearing and exclude the possibility ofany early medical problems.AcknowledgementsThis document is dedicated to the memory of Professor MikeWallace who sadly passed away in the final stages of its develop-ment.
