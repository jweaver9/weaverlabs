In this chapter, we treat  gender as the mainstream topic that it is and focus our attention on the role of women and the  LGBTQ community in British politics. For most of history, British politics were dominated by men. The vast majority of Prime Ministers, members of parliament (MPs), peers (members of the House of Lords) and monarchs were male. It was only in the twentieth century, and after violent protests, that women were granted the right to vote and stand for elections. Women have since become MPs, peers, secretaries of state, and, in two cases, Prime Ministers. Overall, British politics has experienced a process of ‘feminisation’ over the past two decades, in the sense that women and their concerns have become more integrated into Britain’s political parties and political institutions (Lovenduski  2005 ). Yet, the path to more gender- balanced politics has been slow and, despite real progress, true gender equality has not yet been achieved. Over the past two decades, Parliament at Westminster has also become a more inclusive workplace for the LGBTQ community. MPs, peers, and staff working at Parliament feel more confi dent to come out as LGBTQ, and the number of (openly) LGBTQ MPs has gone up in recent years. In order to analyse the representation of women and the LGBTQ com-munity in British politics, this chapter draws on Hanna Pitkin’s ( 1967 ) classic typology of descriptive, symbolic, and substantive representation. Descriptive representation refers to a notion of correspondence between the characteristics of the representative and the represented. This is sometimes also referred to as statistical representation. Symbolic representation means that the symbols represent something or someone because they ‘stand for’ and ‘evoke’ their referent. Finally, substantive representation refers to the notion that representatives represent the interests of the represented, thereby responding to their preferences. While these are different dimensions of representation, they are closely connected and best seen as part of a whole. 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   245 22-Apr-21   11:05:49Politics UK Part 3 Representative process246 The fi rst part of this chapter focuses on descriptive representation by highlighting the slow increase in the number of women and the LGBTQ community in Parliament (the House of Commons and the House of Lords) and central government. It highlights that, whilst the number of women has gone up, Parliament is still not truly representative. In addition, most of the pres-tigious and powerful positions in Parliament and government have been, and continue to be, held by men. It also demonstrates that Scottish and Welsh politics have been more feminised since devolution began in the late 1990s, while Northern Ireland is beginning to catch up. The second part of this chapter discusses the substantive representation of women’s and LGBTQ issues by British governments from Margaret Thatcher to Boris Johnson. It stresses that a lot of progress has been made when it comes to gender equality legislation and anti- discrimination policies. At the same time, it is argued that the governments’ austerity agenda from 2010 onwards, as well as the management of Britain’s exit from the European Union (‘Brexit’) and the Covid- 19 pandemic have affected women disproportionately, and in particular those who are less well off, and those from ethnic minorities. The fi nal part of this chapter discusses the extent to which British politics is a friendly environment for women and the LGBTQ commu-nity. Here, the culture and working conditions inside Parliament but also the broader cultural context (the media and social media) are taken into account. It is demonstrated that female politicians – even the most powerful – are regularly patronised and trivialised in Parliament and in front of the camera. Most worryingly, MP candidates, and in particular female candidates, have been harassed during recent election campaigns and on social media.  The slow increase of women in Parliament and Government  The House of Commons  In its long history, Parliament at Westminster has never been gender- balanced. So far, the highest share of female MPs was achieved in the 2019 general election, which resulted in 34 per cent of female MPs. But let us go back in time to see when women were fi rst elected, and how we got to where we are now. In 1918, some women over the age of 30 (those who met a property qualifi cation) got the right to vote, aft er the  suff ragettes had tirelessly fought for ‘Votes for Women’. In addition, the Parliament (Qualifi cation of Women) Act was passed in 1918, which allowed women to stand as candidates and be elected as MPs. In the same year, Countess Constance Markievicz was elected to represent Dublin St Patricks, but as a member of Sinn F é in she did not take her seat in the House of Commons. Th is decision was in accordance with Sinn F é in’s ‘abstentionist’ policy which still holds today. Th e year aft er, Nancy Astor became the fi rst woman to sit in the House of Commons aft er winning a by- election in Plymouth Sutton for the Conservative Party. Yet it was only in 1928 that women gained electoral equality with men, as the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act gave all women the vote at the age of 21.  In the following years, the number of female MPs rose only slowly, reaching 15 in 1931. Still only 24 female MPs were elected in the 1945 general election, and this number did not increase markedly for another 50 years. Indeed, until 1987, the proportion of female MPs always remained below 5 per cent. In 1992, the share of women elected to the House of Commons rose to 9.2 per cent and then doubled to 120 women MPs (18.2 per cent) at the 1997 general election. Since then, the number of female MPs has risen less dramatically.  Figure 11.1 illustrates the increase in female MPs, both in numbers and as the overall percentage.  With its 34 per cent of female MPs, the House of Commons currently takes thirty- ninth place in a global comparison (see  Table 11.1 ).  Why has it taken the House of Commons over a hundred years to achieve even a 1:3 female/ male gender ratio? For a start, the UK’s majoritarian electoral system that is used to elect MPs, ‘fi rst past the post’, is partially responsible for the low share of women in the Commons. Existing scholarship demonstrates that female candidates have signifi cantly higher chances of being elected under a list proportional system than under any other system (Stockemer  2007 ). However, the key explanation lies with the UK’s two major parties of 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   246 22-Apr-21   11:05:49Chapter 11 Gender and British politics 247government, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. In both parties, there were cultures of explicit and inexplicit sexism. For a long time, the two parties also refused to imple-ment gender quotas, which are the quickest and most eff ective way to achieve gender parity inside parties, parliament, and government. Furthermore, local party organisations have traditionally held control over the selection of MP candidates. Party leaders at Westminster interfering in the candi-date selection process was not welcomed by local parties. Historically, most constituency parties chose men (white, and usually from a middle- class background) over women in winnable seats, as this was seen as a lower risk. For the 1997 general elections, the Labour Party had introduced all- women shortlists (AWS) in half of the winnable seats for the fi rst time. Th is decision was controversial amongst the party. Aft er all, Labour’s roots are in the (overwhelmingly male) labour movement and, at the time, many of the major trade unions were dominated by men. Th e AWS led to a sudden increase in female MPs in 1997, the year of Labour’s landslide election under Tony Blair. Since 2005, Labour has success-fully employed all- women shortlists in all elections (Kenny  2018 : 129). As a result, it now has the highest proportion of female candidates and MPs.  As the example of the Labour Party shows, party ideology matters when we examine female representation. Across Europe, left - wing parties (labour, social democratic, workers parties and green parties) have been better at representing women (as well as the LGBTQ community and ethnic/ reli-gious minorities) than conservative and liberal parties, who oft en oppose quotas. From 1918 until 2019, Labour has had the highest overall number of female MPs: of the 552 women MPs ever elected, 55 per cent were fi rst elected as Labour  Table 11.1  Percentage of women in parliaments around the world  Ranking  Country  MPs (% female)  1  Rwanda  61.3%  2  Cuba  53.2%  3  Bolivia  53.1%  4  Mexico  48.2%  5  Sweden  47.3%  6  Grenada  46.7%  7  Namibia  46.2%  8  Costa Rica  45.6%  9  Nicaragua  44.6%  10  South Africa  42.7%  11  Senegal  41.8%  12  Finland  41.5%  13  Spain  41.1%  14  Norway  40.8%  15  New Zealand  40.0%  15  Timor- Leste  40.0%  17  France  39.7%  18  Mozambique  39.6%  19  Argentina  38.8%  19  Ethiopia  38.8%  39  United Kingdom  32.0% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%050100150200250300191819231929193519501955196419701974 O19831992200120102017Candidates/MPs (% female)sPMelamefforebmuNFemale MPs (N) Candidates (% female) Figure 11.1  Female Members of Parliament and candidates, change over time 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   247 22-Apr-21   11:05:49Politics UK Part 3 Representative process248and 31 per cent as Conservative MPs (House of Commons Library  2020 ).  Th e Conservative Party is slowly catching up with Labour. Between 2005 and 2020, the number of female conservative MPs has almost quadrupled, in part due to the  Women2Win campaign led by female Tory MPs, with the support of party leader David Cameron, who was keen to feminise the party and thereby win more female voters. In 2005, under Cameron’s leadership, the Conservative Party’s headquarters also drew up a ‘Priority List’ of parliamentary candidates, of whom 50 per cent were women. As a consequence, in 2010, the number of female Conservative MPs had more than doubled, from 17 to 49. Compared to the 257 male MPs, this was still a modest overall result. Aft er the 2019 elections, still only 24 per cent of Tory MPs were women, whilst for the fi rst time the Labour Party had slightly more women MPs (51 per cent) than men.  Figure 11.2 shows the number of female and male MPs elected in 2019 (per party).  Perhaps the most remarkable case is that of the Liberal Democrats. Between 1918 and 2019, only 5.6 per cent of the Liberal Democrats’ MPs have been women (House of Commons Library  2020 : 5). Indeed, the 2015 general election returned an all- male group of MPs, aft er the LibDems had lost the majority of their seats. Th e big gender gap was now identifi ed as a problem. Future (and fi rst female) party leader Jo Swinson initially opposed a gender quota, but eventually came to endorse all- women shortlists, arguing that her party had been complicit in the application of all- men shortlists. In 2017, the LibDems implemented all- women shortlists in key seats for the fi rst time, and over half of their female candidates stood in potentially winnable seats (Kenny  2018 ). Aft er the 2019 snap election, 64 per cent of LibDem MPs (seven out of 11 MPs) were female. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party con-tinues to oppose all- women shortlists. In 2016, Conservative Party chairman Patrick O’Loughlin argued that imposing all- women shortlists on Conservative associations might create feelings of resentment, which would not help those female MPs or candidates once they are selected.  Not only has the number of female MPs increased over time; women have also been appointed or elected to some of the House of Commons’ most prestigious and powerful jobs. Amongst such roles are those of  the speaker of the house ,  the leader of the house , and  select committee chairs . Th e fi rst (and only) woman to become Speaker of the House of Commons was Betty Boothroyd (Labour Party) in 1992, having previously served as the deputy Speaker. We should, however, also note that from 1970 to 1973, Tory MP Betty Harvie Anderson was the fi rst female deputy Speaker of the Commons. More recently, a growing number of women have become deputy Speakers. In parts, this is due to the fact that in 2010, a gender quota was written into the Standing orders for the election of the deputy Speakers.  Another high- profi le role is that of the Leader of the House of Commons. At the time of writing, four women MPs had been Leaders of the Commons: Ann Taylor (1997– 1998), Margaret Beckett (1998– 2001), Harriet Harman (2007– 2010), and Andrea Leadsom (2017– 2019). Th us, the fi rst three female Leaders of the Commons were in power during New Labour’s reign.  MPs can also gain infl uence and become experts in par-ticular policy areas by becoming chairpersons of the House of Commons’ select committees. In 1992, Conservative MP 87 1047 2227898450-5050150250350450550650Conserva\u0002ve Labour Liberal Democrat OthersdetcelesPMforebmuNWomen Men Figure 11.2  Number of MPs elected in 2019 (gender) 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   248 22-Apr-21   11:05:49Chapter 11 Gender and British politics 249Marion Roe became the fi rst female chair of a departmental select committee – the Health and Social Care Committee. Since then, the number of select committees chaired by women has slowly increased, but the majority of select committees are still chaired by men (Childs  2016 : 22). Th ere is, however, gender disparity between the parties when it comes to putting forward candidates for committee chairs. In January 2020, when the select committee chairs were elected, only 9 per cent of the Conservative candidates for committee chair elections were women, compared to 70 per cent of candidates for the Labour party (Nice  2020 ).  Focusing our attention on the membership of select committees, the picture is a little more complex. From 1979 until 2016, women were slightly overrepresented on committees relative to the proportion of female MPs in the House of Commons as a whole (Goodwin et al.  2020 ). However, female MPs were, and continue to be, much more likely than their male counterparts to be assigned to committees dealing with lower- status, ‘feminised’ policy areas, such as health, women and equalities, work and pensions, education, etc. Th ese policy areas tend to be less prestigious, but no less important than the ‘masculine’ policy areas, such as defence, foreign aff airs, Northern Ireland aff airs – to name but a few. Female committee membership is therefore highly concentrated in a small number of committees. Interestingly, the home aff airs committee has been chaired by a woman, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, since 2016, and the membership of the committee has been strongly female. In most countries, home aff airs are perceived as a highly prestigious, and there-fore, masculine policy area (Krook and O’Brien  2012 ) and the post of the Home Secretary usually goes to men. Goodwin et al. ( 2020 : 23) point out that in UK politics, home aff airs should rather be categorised as a medium- status policy area (as compared to the high politics of foreign aff airs), which might explain its recent feminisation.  Despite the steady increase in the number of female committee members, two recently created select committees – the International Trade and Exiting the European Union committees – both have male chairs, and their members are predominantly male. In fact, the International Trade Committee only had one female member when it was fi rst set up, making it one of the worst committees in terms of gender balance. Th is clearly matters, as Brexit has been on the top of the government’s agenda since 2016. New trade deals have to be negotiated with the US, China, India, etc. Women will be aff ected by Brexit, and their absence on these select committees refl ects poorly on Parliament. Generally, the low levels of female representation in the high- status select committees can mean that the gender regime in Parliament reproduces itself (Lovenduski,  2012 ) and that some of the important and prestigious legislative work lacks the input of female MPs and, therefore, a more diverse perspective.  In 2015, the Committee for Women and Equalities was created to fill an accountability gap. The UK government has legal commitments to uphold principles of equal rights. Whilst the post of the Minister for Women and Equalities was created in 2014 (the job was previously done by par-liamentary under- secretaries of state), there was no select committee to scrutinise that office until 2015. The creation of the committee was welcomed by many, and its member-ship is almost entirely female. Both the select committee membership and the position of the Minister for Women and Equalities are de facto, and seen as, women’s jobs. The job of the Minister for Women and Equalities is added on to another portfolio, as the holder has also been the Secretary of State for International Trade or for Work and Pensions.  Table 11.2 lists the committees that were chaired by female MPs in recent years.  Recently, more attention has also been paid to the descrip-tive representation of the LGBTQ community in the House of Commons. Aft er the 2019 general elections, there were 54 MPs (up from 48 in 2017) who openly defi ned themselves as LGBTQ: 24 from the Conservative party, 19 from Labour, 9 from the SNP, 1 from the LibDems, and 1 independent MP (see LGBT MP  n.d. ). Th e SNP stands out, with 21 per cent of its MPs belonging to the LGBTQ community. Commentators labelled the House of Commons ‘the gayest parliament in the world’. However, none of the MP candidates who identifi ed as trans or non- binary was successful in 2019.  The House of Lords  Women were only admitted to the House of Lords in 1958, four decades aft er women were granted the right to stand as an MP. Yet campaigners had fought hard for female represen-tation in the Lords. Margaret Haig Th omas, Viscountess Rhondda (1883– 1958), a feminist, former suff ragette, and hereditary Peer fought for women like herself to be able to take up their seats in the House of Lords, but her case was opposed in 1922 (Parliament.uk  2020 ). Hence, there were women who were hereditary peers, but they were not allowed to sit in the House of Lords (House of Lords Library  2015 ). Th e only people who were permitted to sit in the Lords were men: her-editary peers, a small number of judges known as ‘Lords of Appeal in Ordinary’ (or ‘Law Lords’) and bishops. A number of private members’ bills and petitions were presented during the 1920s and aft er the Second World War, but it took until the Life Peerages Act 1958 for women to fi nally be allowed to sit in the Upper House as life peers. Baroness Wootton of Abinger was the fi rst woman to receive letters patent as a life peer in the House of Lords in 1958. During the fi rst decade of women’s admittance to the House of Lords, less than 10 per cent of new appointees were female. Th is is unsurprising, 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   249 22-Apr-21   11:05:49Politics UK Part 3 Representative process250given that the basis of a life peerage is connected to profes-sional achievement. At the time, few women had the oppor-tunity to have the kind of career that would have resulted in a life peerage.  In addition, women were excluded from receiving hereditary peerages until the Peerage Act 1963 came into operation. Yet, as Eason ( 2009 : 403) points out, ‘this equalising of opportunity still privileged male political presence because the bulk of hereditary peerages descend down the male line’. Th e process of primogeniture, whereby heirs are usually male, has historically disadvantaged women’s presence. Hereditary peers comprised the largest group of peers in the chamber before New Labour’s reforms of the House of Lords in 1999. In April 1998, there were 759 hereditary male peers and 17 her-editary female peers, just 2% of all hereditary peers. However, the proportion of female legislators in the House of Lords almost doubled overnight when the House of Lords Act was passed in 1999. Th e purpose of this Act was to improve polit-ical representation in the second chamber so that no party or group had overall control of the House of Lords. Increasing women’s presence in the Lords was not a priority of reform, but a by- product (Eason  2009 : 404). Still, the result was an increased women’s presence from 8.8 per cent to 15.8 per cent.  As of October 2020, 28 per cent of peers were women. Why are women still underrepresented in the upper chamber? To answer this question, we will briefl y examine the appointment procedures of peers, all of which have his-torically disadvantaged women.  Th e membership of the House of Lords is composed of life peers (which make up the largest number), hereditary peers, and bishops. Life peers are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister. Th e Prime Minister decides how many peerages he or she will recommend. By conven-tion, when recommending peerages for members of political parties other than their own, Prime Ministers take advice from the leader of that party. In addition, the House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC), which was set up in 2000, makes recommendations for non- party political peers and vets party nominations for propriety. Eason ( 2009 ) points out that since the HOLAC has been responsible for making cross- bench appointments to the Lords, the number of female peers has increased. Still, successive Prime Ministers have not appointed enough women. Recent Prime Ministers have recognised the lack in gender balance and increased the share of female life peers, but gender parity remains wishful thinking.  Table 11.3 lists the peerage creations (by gender) by Prime Minister in power.  As Russell ( 2000 : 100) has pointed out, part of the reason why there are still fewer female than male life peers is that the share of female MPs has been low. Many life peerages are given to people who were previously MPs. As the share of female MPs is increasing, we can expect the number of female life peers to increase, too.  Second, there is the group of hereditary peers. Although certain peerages may pass to women, the vast majority of titles may only be inherited by a man. Th is principle of male preference primogeniture is still in place. Th e House of Lords Act 1999 removed all but 92 hereditary peers, known as ‘excepted hereditary peers’. In 2020, the Countess of Mar – the only woman amongst the remaining 92 excepted hereditary peers – retired, and her successor had not yet been elected. Th ere have been a number of attempts to reform the principle of male preference primogeniture.

Yet, the government responded in 2012 by saying that changes to the rules governing succession to hereditary titles would be complicated to implement fairly and should be treated as a separate issue from the rules of the succession to the Crown (House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee  2012 ). Since 2013, there have been a few attempts to change the law on the principle of male prefer-ence primogeniture through Private Members’ Bills in the House of Lords. In 2019, the Conservative MP for Shipley, Philip Davies, sought to make provision for the succession of female heirs to hereditary titles with his Hereditary Titles (Female Succession) Bill. It failed to complete its passage through Parliament before the end of the session. In response to questions about the government’s opinion of this bill, the acting minister for the Constitution in the Cabinet Offi  ce, Kevin Foster, reiterated that the issue was ‘complex’ (House of Lords Library  2020 ).  Th e third group of members are the bishops. In the House of Lords, 26 places are traditionally reserved for bishops. Until November 2014, only men could become bishops, which meant that these 26 places were eff ectively reserved for men. In November 2014, however, the Church of England adopted legislation to allow women to be ordained as bishops, and the fi rst female Church of England bishop was consecrated in January 2015. Half a year later, legislation was passed to enable new female Church of England bishops to take a seat in the House of Lords – more quickly than would otherwise have been possible. Previously, the places in the House of Lords reserved for bishops were fi lled in the following manner: fi ve bishops (the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester) would have been automatically granted a seat, whilst the remaining 21 positions would have been fi lled on the basis of seniority. Under these terms, a woman appointed as a diocesan bishop would have had to wait until she was the most senior bishop in order to take a seat in the Lords or be appointed to one of the fi ve positions automatically granted a seat. Th us, the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 introduced provisions that stipulate that a vacancy amongst the 21 non- reserved seats of the Lords Spiritual will be fi lled by a female English diocesan bishop, ahead of male English diocesan bishops. In the absence of a female English diocesan bishop, the longest- serving male bishop will fi ll the place as normal. Th e provi-sion is set to last until 2025. Th e fi rst female diocesan bishop to join the Lords was Rachel Treweek, the Rt Rev. the Lord Bishop of Gloucester, on 7 September 2015 (House of Lords Library Briefi ng,  2017 ). Since then, Christine Hardman (2016), Viv Faull (2018) and Libby Lane (2019) have also entered the Lords on the basis of this Act, shortly aft er becoming diocesan bishops. Th us, four out of seven vacant bishop seats in the Lords in the fi rst fi ve years of the Act were taken by women. In addition (but independently of the Act), Sarah Mullally entered the House of Lords  ex offi  cio when she was appointed Bishop of London in 2018.  Interestingly, female peers – despite their low numbers – have held some of the most prestigious and high- profi le posts, namely: the  Lord Speaker , the  Leader of the Lords , and committee chairs. Indeed, the fi rst two Lord Speakers were women: Baroness Hayman (2006– 2011) and Baroness d’Souza (2011– 2016). Meanwhile, the fi rst female Leader of the Lords was Baroness Young, appointed by Margaret Th atcher in 1981. Since then, six other women have become Leaders of the Lords, and at the time of writing, Baroness Evans of Bowes Park held the post. Th e post of the deputy Leader of the Lords was held by a female peer, Baroness Wootton, for the fi rst time in 1967. Th us, both in the Lords and the Commons, women held deputy roles long before being in charge. We still lack long- time data on the female membership of the Lords’ select committees. An interesting observation is, however, that in recent years, women have become chairs of the committees that are coded as masculine, such as the International Relations committee, the Finance committee, and the EU external aff airs sub- committee.

Th e fi rst openly gay Peer was Lord Alli, who was appointed in 1998. Whilst there aren’t any offi  cial numbers, at the time of writing over twenty peers (from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and the LibDems) were openly LGBTQ. Most notably, the Baroness Hunt of Bethnal Green was appointed to the Lords in 2019. Hunt was the (openly gay) outspoken Chief Executive of Stonewall, a UK- based charity promoting the rights of the LGBTQ community. Upon her appointment, Hunt said that she ‘will continue to do everything in my power to achieve acceptance without exception for all LGBT+ people and advocate for equality for all communities both here and internationally’. Th e peerage of Hunt can be seen as a major step forward in the symbolical representation of the LGBTQ community in British politics. Furthermore, her expertise on LGBTQ issues might enhance the substantive representation of the LGBTQ community in the House of Lords.  Political parties and the gender gap: from the grassroots to the top  One of the reasons why there are fewer female MPs and peers is that political parties in Britain tend to be unrepresentative of the population when it comes to gender (but also regarding their age, social class, level of education, employment, and ethnicity). In 2017, only 30 per cent of Conservative Party members were female, compared to 48 per cent of Labour members, 48 per cent of Green Party members, 43 per cent of SNP members, and 38 per cent of LibDem members (Bale et al. 2019, 32– 34). Only 26 per cent of the UK Independence Party’s (UKIP) members were female in 2017. Th us, now-adays, the more left - leaning parties tend to attract more female members than their right- wing counterparts. Between 2016 and 2017, under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Labour’s female membership increased by 10 per cent. Th is signifi cant increase in female members should not surprise us. Aft er all, women are much more likely than men to be primary carers and work in the public sector, and they had borne the brunt of the austerity measures which Labour opposed much more strongly under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.  Th e parties’ gender gap at the grassroots matters for a number of reasons. For a start, Britain’s party members increasingly take part in important decisions, such as leader-ship elections and referendums on important and contentious issues. Th is gives them a lot of power. Th ey also maintain the local party branches and campaign for their party during and outside of elections. Most importantly, perhaps, they are the parties’ ‘talent pool’ from which candidates for public offi  ce are selected. In turn, party members select their local candidates for parliamentary elections. As women remain underrepresented inside parties, this has implications for the parties’ policies, choice of leaders, selection of candidates, and their image. Th e UK Independence Party (UKIP) and other right- wing populist parties in Europe have a particular problem with women. Th ese are ‘men’s parties’ and breeding grounds for ‘toxic masculinity’ (Daddow and Hertner  2019 ).  As mentioned earlier on in this chapter, the Labour Party and the LibDems have implemented diff erent types of quotas to enhance female representation in parliament. But when we consider the number of women at the very top of the two parties, their record is at best mixed. Whilst Labour remains the party with the highest total share of female MPs, it has never had a female non- interim party leader. Harriet Harman was interim leader for a few months in 2010 and 2015 aft er Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband had stepped down as party leaders. Yet there was no shortage of female candidates in Labour’s recent leadership elections. In 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn became party leader, two male and two female candidates were in the race. Ahead of the 2016 snap lead-ership election, Corbyn stood against one other male candi-date (and won). Th e 2020 Labour leadership election stood out in terms of its feminisation: Keir Starmer was the only male candidate. Initially, four women were in the contest, but two women dropped out before the fi nal ballot. In the end, Keir Starmer won the leadership contest. Angela Rayner (see Profi le) was elected deputy party leader, following in the footsteps of two other women, Margaret Beckett (1992– 1994) and Harriet Harman (2007– 2015).  Th e fact that Labour has not yet had a female leader might appear puzzling, but there are a number of explanations, such as the patronising media coverage of female candidates, who are oft en judged by their looks, a biased party membership that tends to see men as more experienced – even when male and female candidates have equal levels of experience, and misogyny within the Labour Party’s inner leadership circle – especially under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.  Meanwhile, the LibDems elected their fi rst female leader, Jo Swinson, in 2019. Yet Swinson lost her seat in parliament in the same year’s elections, and with it, the party leadership. Th e Green Party of England and Wales has had several female leaders in the past and a gender- balanced leadership duo since 2016. Even UKIP has been led by a woman, Diane James, in 2016, although she resigned aft er 18 days due to a lack of support from within the party. Th is leaves the Conservative Party as the UK’s only major party of government to have been led by two women.  It is also worth noting here that all of the UK’s major parties have established offi  cial LGBTQ groups that cam-paign for LGBTQ rights inside and outside of their parties. For example, the Labour LGBT+ group (formally called Gay 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   252 22-Apr-21   11:05:49Chapter 11 Gender and British politics 253Labour Group) is a socialist society which has existed since 1975 – and the LGBT+ Labour Councillors Network that was established in September 2018 to support Labour’s local councillors and candidates identifying as LGBTQ. Meanwhile, the LGBT+ Conservatives Group was set up in 2006 as the successor of the Tory Campaign for Homosexual Equality, a campaign group fi rst created in 1975. Th e LibDems launched LGBT+ Liberal Democrats in 1988 (when it was called Democrats for Lesbian & Gay Action). Th ese are just a few examples. Other parties, such as the Greens or the SNP, have also set up designated groups for their LGBTQ members. All of these groups campaign for more descriptive, substantive, and symbolic representation of LGBTQ people inside their parties and UK politics more generally.  From the backbenches to the frontbenches: women in government  Th e UK’s two female Prime Ministers, Margaret Th atcher (1979– 1990) and Th eresa May (2016– 2019), rose through the ranks of the (predominantly male) Conservative Party. Yet, both Th atcher and May became leaders at a moment of crisis, like many other female party leaders around the world. ‘In other words’, Kenny ( 2018 : 132) writes, ‘women oft en come to power when the job at the top is least desirable and are left  to clean up for someone else’s mess.’ Th atcher became the party leader in 1975, aft er two lost general elections. Th eresa May became party leader and Prime Minister in 2016, aft er David Cameron had lost the Brexit referendum and stepped down. As the (male) top contenders for the job, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, destroyed each other’s chances of becoming party leader and Prime Minister, two women were left  in the race: Andrea Leadsom and Th eresa May. Leadsom, a key Leave campaigner and environment secretary under Cameron, gave an interview in which she declared herself to be more in touch with voters than May, stating that ‘genuinely I feel that being a mum means you have a real stake in the future of our country, a tangible stake’. Aft er apologising to May (who does not have children) and aft er much criticism from the media and some of her party colleagues, Leadsom decided to withdraw from the leadership contest. Th e prem-iership was May’s, but she was dealt a bad hand, becoming Prime Minister when her party and the country were deeply divided over Brexit.  Let us now have a look at the share of female Secretaries of State and their portfolios. Th e fi rst female MP to become a minister was Margaret Bondfi eld. She was minister for Labour in Ramsay MacDonald’s 1929– 31 Labour govern-ment. Between the 1920s and the early 1990s, only seven other women served as cabinet ministers – amongst them, Margaret Th atcher. Yet, when Th atcher was Prime Minister, only one other woman was appointed to her Cabinet during the entire eleven years. It was Janet Young, who as Leader  P R O F I L E   Angela Rayner (1980– )  Angela Rayner, Member of Parliament for Ashton- under- Lyne since 2015, has been serving as Shadow First Secretary of State and deputy leader of the Labour Party since April 2020. Between 2016 and 2020, she was Shadow Secretary of State for Education. Rayner stands out from her colleagues in Parliament, many of whom come from a middle- class background and have university degrees. Rayner grew up on a social housing estate, raised by her mother, who had mental health problems and could not read or write. Rayner left  secondary school at the age of 16 when she was pregnant, raising her son alone. Later, she attended college and qualifi ed as a care worker. During this time, she joined Unison (a trade union) and went on to become Unison’s most senior elected offi  cial in north west England. In 2014, she was selected to become a Labour candidate, arguing that ‘times are too tough for too many and we need real people, with real life experience to bring a bit of common sense to policy- making in Westminster’. As an MP, Rayner has voted in favour of paying higher benefi ts over longer periods for those unable to work due to illness or disability. She also voted in favour of gay marriage and stronger LGBTQ rights. 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   253 22-Apr-21   11:05:49Politics UK Part 3 Representative process254of the House of Lords was not permitted the responsibility of running a department. Generally, when women became Secretaries of State they were in charge of briefs that are coded as feminine, such as health and social aff airs, education, and pensions. Th is pattern started to be interrupted by Tony Blair, who appointed women to some of the more prestigious posts. For example, Margaret Beckett was appointed Britain’s fi rst female foreign secretary by Blair in 2006. Blair had appointed fi ve women to his 1997 government, which was the fi rst to include more than two female ministers at the time. Th e highest number of women ministers serving in a cabinet was eight (36 per cent), from May 2006 to May 2007, under Blair (House of Commons Library  2020 : 8).  At the time of writing, following the February 2020 re- shuffl  e, there were six women in Boris Johnson’s Cabinet (27 per cent of the 22 full cabinet posts). One of these posts was unpaid and held by Amanda Milling (minister without port-folio). In addition, there were four ministers who could attend Cabinet, but Suella Braverman (the Attorney General) was the only woman out of these four. Overall, there were 39 female Government Ministers and Whips in 2020, which amounted to a third of the 117 individuals in Government. Th us, so far, not a single government has been gender- balanced.  In recent years, a small number of women have been in charge of some of the high- prestige departments that are trad-itionally coded as masculine, such as home aff airs (Th eresa May, 2010– 2016; Amber Rudd, 2016– 2018; Priti Patel, 2019– ), defence (Penny Mordaunt, 2019), international trade (Liz Truss, 2019– ) or as gender neutral (but low- prestige), such as international development (Priti Patel, 2016– 2017, Penny Mordaunt, 2017– 2019; Anne- Marie Trevelyan, 2020– ). Having more female secretaries of state in positions of power and prestige enhances the symbolic representation of women. Still, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was accused of running an ‘incredibly blokey’ government when it emerged that the most important cabinet committees, where many of the government’s strategic decisions are taken, were predomin-antly male. Not one cabinet committee was gender- balanced, and six out of 15 did not have a single female member.  It is also noteworthy that no woman has ever been Chancellor of the Exchequer, which is considered the most prestigious cabinet post aft er that of the Prime Minister. Still, in 2020, the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, appointed Anneliese Dodds as shadow chancellor – the fi rst woman to hold this position. Th us, in Whitehall, women have only slowly started to rise to positions of executive power. Th is is unsurprising: across the globe, the more women there are in parliament, the more female ministers there are – and in non- traditional roles. Th e number of female Secretaries of State is therefore likely to increase over time.  Gender and Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish politics  Th is section provides a brief overview of the feminisation of Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish politics. It demonstrates that the political institutions and politics in all three nations have become more feminised since the  devolution process began in the late 1990s. Still, the extent of feminisation varies between the three.  Th e creation of the new political institutions in Edinburgh, Cardiff , and Belfast off ered a window of opportunity to learn lessons from Westminster, where – despite the 1997 spike in female representation under New Labour – women had remained underrepresented. Women thus organised and campaigned for better representation at Holyrood (the Scottish Parliament) and the Welsh Parliament. Equality- seeking reformers in Scotland and Wales infl uenced the shape  P R O F I L E   Theresa May (1956– )  Theresa May, Member of Parliament for Maidenhead since 1997, was the UK’s second female Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party from 2016 until 2019. Before becoming Prime Minister, May was the UK’s longest serving Home Secretary (2010– 2016) in over 60 years. She also served as Minister for Women and Equality (2010– 2012).  When May was fi rst elected to Parliament, she was one out of only 13 female Conservative MPs. Over the years, May has supported the feminisation of the Conservative Party. In 2002, when she was chairman of the Conservative Party, she warned the delegates at the party conference that they were seen as ‘the nasty party’, out of touch and unrepresentative of modern Britain. In 2005, she co- founded  Women2Win , a mentoring and pressure group that helped female Tories become candidates and enter Parliament. Yet, May’s record on women’s and LGBTQ issues is very mixed. Whilst she was the driving force behind the 2015 Modern Slavery Act and the 2017 Domestic Violence Bill, her support of austerity politics and her draconian immigration policies made life harder for poorer and migrant women. During her time as an MP May became more supportive of LGBTQ rights. 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   254 22-Apr-21   11:05:49Chapter 11 Gender and British politics 255of the new devolved institutions. For instance, equal oppor-tunities committees in the legislatures and equality units in government were created, and family- friendly sitting hours were introduced (Mackay and McAllister  2012 ). What is more, decision- makers committed to gender equality in policy making and implemented new legal responsibilities to pro-mote equality of opportunity (including the powerful statu-tory equality duty in Wales). It is therefore unsurprising that the fi rst elections to the newly created parliaments represented a sea change in women’s representation. In Scotland, 37 per cent of members of the new Scottish Parliament were female – an event that Kenny ( 2013 ) describes as a ‘gender coup’. In Wales, women comprised 40 per cent (rising shortly thereaft er to 42 per cent) of the new Welsh Parliament. Th ese results were achieved through gender quotas, used by the Labour party in Scotland and Wales, and matched by formal or informal measures by the two left ist nationalist parties, the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Plaid Cymru (the Party of Wales; see Russell et al.  2002 ).  Since the late 1990s, women have generally made up 30 to 40 per cent of members aft er each parliamentary election. At the Welsh Parliament, aft er a by- election in 2006, 31 out of 60 Assembly Members (AMs), or 52 per cent, were women (House of Commons Library  2020 : 10). Meanwhile, the results of the 2016 Scottish parliamentary elections were disappointing for gender parity, as only 34.9 per cent of female Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) were elected, exactly the same proportion as in the previous elections of 2011. In fact, the 2003 Scottish Parliament elections remain the high point of women’s representation in Scotland (at 39.5 per cent). While in 2016 the SNP and Labour’s use of quotas made a diff erence, the overall number of women has stagnated due in large part to the strong performance of the Conservative Party across Scotland: only around 19 per cent of Scottish Conservative candidates were women in 2016, and one of their regional lists, Highlands and Islands, was men- only (Kenny et al. 2016). Th e Scottish Parliament launched a campaign in 2019 aiming to get more women to become MSPs.  In Scotland and Wales, women have also gained more pos-itional power in recent years, which has done much for the symbolic representation of women. One of the most powerful women in British politics is Nicola Sturgeon, who became fi rst minister of Scotland (and SNP leader) in 2014, having served as deputy fi rst minister from 2007 to 2014. She is the fi rst woman to hold the position and the fi rst female leader of any of the devolved UK administrations. Th e other major parties in Scotland have also been led by women over the past two decades. Th e Scottish Conservative Party was led by Annabel Goldie (2005– 2011) and Ruth Davidson (2011– 2019). Unlike the UK Labour Party, the Scottish Labour Party has also been led by women: Wendy Alexander led the party from 2007 to 2008, and Kezia Dugdale from 2015 to 2017. It is also noteworthy that in Scotland, between 2015 and 2017, the two main opposition parties (the Conservatives and Labour) were led by women (Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale). Th is has not yet happened in the other parts of the United Kingdom. In Wales, Leanne Wood was leader of Plaid Cymru from 2012 to 2018. Prior to the late 1990s, Plaid Cymru was an overwhelmingly male party but it began to feminise post devolution. So far, the Welsh Conservative Party and Labour Party have been led by men, and, unlike Scotland, Wales has not yet had a female fi rst minister.  When it comes to the descriptive representation of the LGBTQ community, the Scottish Parliament had 7 per cent of openly gay MSPs in 2016. Also, in 2016, four out of Scotland’s six party leaders (the Conservatives’ Ruth Davidson, Labour’s Kezia Dugdale, Ukip’s David Coburn and the Greens’ Patrick Harvie) were openly lesbian, gay or bisexual. Having LGBTQ people in positions of political leadership in Scotland has been important in enhancing the symbolic representa-tion of the LGBTQ community. Perhaps unsurprisingly, in 2015, the Rainbow Europe Index identifi ed Scotland as the best country in Europe when it came to legal protections for LGBTQ people. Meanwhile, there are about 5 per cent of LGBTQ AMs in Wales. Here, the LGBTQ community and their rights have a lower profi le than in Scotland.  Northern Ireland has been led by a female executive since January 2020: First Minister Arlene Foster (Democratic Unionist Party, DUP) and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill (Sinn F é in). Yet, since devolution began, women have been underrepresented in the Northern Ireland Assembly (Stormont). In 2013, when only 19 per cent of the Members of the Assembly (MLAs) were female (the same percentage as in 2011) it was noted that in the European context, ‘with the exception of Italian regional legislatures, the Northern Ireland Assembly has the lowest female representation of comparable devolved institutions in Western Europe’ (Northern Ireland Assembly  2013 : 3). Initially, the low number of female MLAs was explained with reference to Northern Ireland’s violent confl ict over its constitutional status during the late twentieth century. Aft er all, men were much more likely to be involved in violence during the Troubles, and as the power- sharing parliament was predicated on bringing together organisations formerly involved in violence and encouraging them to engage in peaceful political participation, women were oft en excluded. During the peace talks leading to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition (NIWC) sought to represent women from the diff erent sides of the confl ict. However, large numbers of male politicians sought to exclude them by heckling them during talks, in order to silence them. Since the late 1990s, the number of female MLAs has increased slowly. By the time of the May 2016 elections, 28 per cent of MLAs were female. 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   255 22-Apr-21   11:05:50Politics UK Part 3 Representative process256 On International Women’s Day 2016, a cross- party Women’s Caucus was launched in the Northern Ireland Assembly to tackle the under- representation of women in political life. Th e 2017 snap elections returned 30 per cent of female MLAs. Northern Ireland’s biggest parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn F é in, are now both led by women, following the resignation of leading political fi gures Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson. In addition, since October 2016, the Alliance party has been led by a woman, Naomi Long, who was also appointed as Minister for Justice in 2020. Th us, despite the initial hurdles, politics are beginning to feminise in Northern Ireland. What is more, in December 2019, the second openly gay MLA was elected. Th is could be seen as a sign that Stormont and Northern Irish politics more generally might become a more LGBTQ- friendly place. Still, the situation is complex, and LGBTQ rights remain contested in Northern Ireland. As Hayes and Nagle ( 2016 ) demonstrate, LGBTQ rights have become entangled with the struggle for ethnonational rights in Northern Ireland. Irish nationalist parties have supported stronger LGBTQ rights because they see them as compat-ible with the advancement of the equality agenda and the demand for minority rights. Unionist parties, by contrast, resist LGBTQ rights as they view them as a Trojan horse deployed by nationalists to attack unionist identity. Th is view is also shared by Northern Ireland’s Protestant community. Th us, in post- peace- agreement Northern Ireland, the diff e-rence in support for LGBTQ rights between the two main communities – Unionist and Nationalist – has now become ‘a war by other means’ (Hayes and Nagle  2016 ).  Gender and local government  Let us now turn our attention to the descriptive represen-tation of women and LGBTQ people in local government across the UK. Th e lack of diversity when it comes to gender, ethnicity, disability in local government across the UK was highlighted in a damning report published by the Fawcett Society in 2017. Th e report states that in 2017, only one in three local councillors in England was a woman, up only 5 per-centage points in two decades. Furthermore, in the devolved regions, all of the six elected metro mayors were men, and just 12 per cent of combined authority representatives were women. Following the 2019 local elections in England, 35 per cent of local councillors were female (Fawcett Society  2019 ). Furthermore, Fawcett highlighted that a third of female councillors had experienced sexist comments from their colleagues, and that many LGBTQ women had experienced multiple forms of discrimination. Th e Fawcett Society therefore called for a code of conduct against sexism to be introduced, and an eff ective Standards Committee to enforce it. Fawcett also asked the UK Government to require parties to collect accurate election candidate diversity data, to enable a better understanding of how women, ethnic minorities, disabled people and the LGBTQ community are represented at the local level. Th is data is currently not sys-tematically collected, and it is therefore diffi  cult to get a full picture of the representation of the LGBTQ community in local government. In recent surveys, 8 per cent of candidates for local council elections in England and Wales declared to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or other (Equality and Human Rights Commission  2019 ).  In the UK’s devolved nations, local government is even less gender- balanced than in England. Th us, in Scotland’s local councils, only 29 per cent of elected representatives were female in 2020 (up from 24 per cent in the previous elections) whilst in Wales, 28 per cent of local councillors were female in 2020 (up from 26 per cent in the previous elections). In Northern Ireland’s 2019 local elections, 26.4 per cent of elected local councillors were women (up from 25.1 per cent in the previous elections). Th ese low levels of female representation are largely due to the lack of party quotas at the local level. It is, however, worth highlighting that the share of female local councillors in Europe is 33 per cent, meaning that more needs to be done across Europe to enhance gender diversity in local politics.  The UK’s governments from Thatcher to Johnson: representing women’s and LGBTQ issues?  Having equal gender representation inside the UK’s polit-ical institutions is a matter of justice. Another important question to ask is whether having more female political leaders makes a diff erence for women. Th is refers to Hanna Pitkin’s notion of substantive representation, or the represen-tation of women’s interests. Existing research shows that having a critical mass of female politicians makes a diff e-rence, as women politicians are generally more inclined than men to attach importance to women’s issues (Childs  2004 ). Having gender- balanced political institutions is therefore not just a matter of justice, but also of fairness.  Th ere is a growing interest in whether and how female politicians represent women’s interests. But what are women’s interests? For a long time, scholars interested in the 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   256 22-Apr-21   11:05:50Chapter 11 Gender and British politics 257representation of women’s interests had a  feminist (left - wing) bias and argued that right- wing/ conservative governments did not represent women’s interests, as they did not challenge the patriarchy, did too little to promote women’s careers (e.g. by refusing to implement gender quotas or by neglecting to improve childcare provision) or ignored the gender pay gap. Yet, right- wing/ conservative parties and governments also represent the interests of women, namely, of their female members and voters, who tend to be socially more conser-vative (and economically more liberal). Th us, in recent years, scholars have broadened their focus and examined centre- right parties and their representation of women’s interests. Celis and Childs ( 2012 : 214) highlight that ‘given that “women” are not a homogeneous but a heterogeneous group – and because feminism simply does not speak for, or to, all women – good representation is enhanced by “the making present of ” complementary, competing and confl icting views on what women, and their interests and needs, are’. Still, while conservative parties represent the interests of their female voters, they have done less to enhance gender equality than their left ist counterparts. Indeed, feminists have been more willing to represent women’s interests and change policy for women in a feminist way.  Acknowledging that women’s interests are very diverse – are there at least some policy areas then can be defi ned as ‘women’s issues’? At a fi rst glance, these are rather diffi  cult to pin down, as almost all political decisions aff ect women. Th ere are, however, a number of criteria that can be used to identify whether parties’ claims constitute the substan-tive representation of women. According to Celis et al. ( 2009 ) (cited by Celis and Childs  2012 : 219), such claims would be: (1) directly  constructed as being of importance to women; (2)  presented as only aff ecting women; (3)  discussed in terms of gender diff erence; (4)  spoken of in terms of gendered eff ects; and/ or (5)  framed in terms of equality between women and men. Th ese criteria can help us under-stand how political parties seek to address female voters. For example, in her analysis of women’s issues during the 2017 general election, Kenny ( 2018 ) demonstrates that the UK’s parties addressed female voters by referring to issues such as sexual violence, the gender pay gap, parental leave, childcare, education, social care, and public services more broadly.  When it comes to the political representation of LGBTQ interests, the analysis is also complex. Th e UK’s LGBTQ com-munity is ideologically very diverse and spans across the pol-itical spectrum. Still, we can categorise LGBTQ issues as those that address the civil rights of LGBTQ persons: for instance, when political parties have called for equal rights for LGBTQ persons, such as the right for same- sex couples to marry or adopt children. More recently, trans- rights, such as gender recognition, have become a political issue.  Margaret Thatcher and the representation of women’s and LGBTQ issues  As Britain’s fi rst female Prime Minister, Margaret Th atcher is a particularly intriguing case. Her election was important for women’s symbolic representation. British political leadership could no longer seen as a male domain. It is, however, widely argued that Th atcher’s politics did not prioritise women’s issues, but that her dismantling of the British welfare state had overwhelmingly negative eff ects on women. In her analysis of Margaret Th atcher’s and John Major’s legacy when it comes to women and the family, Gillian Pascall ( 1997 ) argues that women’s position as women at the end of the Conservative era was on balance better than it was at the beginning, in the sense that more women were in paid employment. Yet many changes owed more to the women’s movement than they did to Th atcher’s and Major’s policies. Under Th atcher, the government unsuccessfully tried to restore the traditional family through measures such as the Child Support Act, in an attempt to restore the situation in which fathers were the family’s breadwinners (and mothers stayed at home to do most of the care work). Nevertheless, the spread of market forces through the labour market, housing, and other social provi-sion, as initiated by Th atcher, contributed to destabilising the family rather than restoring it (Pascall  1997 : 292). Th atcher’s governments did not go back on equal opportunities legisla-tion, but they resisted further policies to make equal oppor-tunities compatible with motherhood and other caring roles. Th us, more women entered the labour market in the 1980s and 1990s, but there was no extension of nursery provision or rights to enable parents to combine paid and unpaid work responsibilities.  During her premiership, Th atcher openly opposed the promotion of a gay lifestyle in order to protect the trad-itional family. In her memoirs, she wrote that: ‘Homosexual activists have moved from seeking a right of privacy to demanding social approval for the “gay” lifestyle, equal status with the heterosexual family and even the legal right to exploit the sexual uncertainty of adolescents’ (Th atcher  1995 : 152). At the 1987 Conservative Party conference, she declared: ‘Children who need to be taught to respect trad-itional moral values are being taught that they have the inalienable right to be gay’ (Th atcher 1987, cited by Smith  1994 : 218). According to Smith ( 1994 ) Th atcher’s discourse was deeply infl uenced by the homophobic media coverage of AIDS. She also attempted to block explicit, public health warnings about AIDS because they mentioned male sexual acts. Also, under Th atcher’s rule, in 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was enacted – a law that stopped local councils and schools ‘promoting the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   257 22-Apr-21   11:05:50Politics UK Part 3 Representative process258relationship’. In practice, teachers were prohibited from discussing even the possibility of same- sex relationships with students, and libraries were not allowed to have LGBTQ- themed literature on their shelves.  Tony Blair and the representation of women’s and LGBTQ issues  When New Labour entered government under Tony Blair in 1997, promoting gender equality was a key concern. Indeed, a Women’s Unit (which later on became the Women’s and Equality Unit) was created at the heart of government to scru-tinise all legislation to ensure that policies across all areas were women- friendly and would promote gender equality. Th e unit worked primarily on the following themes: reducing the gender pay gap, improving work- life balance, increasing the number of women in public life, improving women’s access to public services, and combatting domestic violence (Squires and Wickham- Jones  2004 : 86– 87). Over time, the unit’s remit narrowed around economic issues, which, according to Squires and Wickham- Jones ( 2004 : 93), was unsurprising, given that New Labour’s arguments for equality were shaped in terms of economic effi  ciency and competition rather than gender justice.  Under New Labour, a series of important welfare reforms in the domain of work- life balance were passed. Most notably, through the Employment Act 2002, the right to take leave when a child is born was extended to women and men, as well as the right for parents of young children and those with other caring responsibilities to request (but not necessarily receive) fl exible employment. Th ese reforms signifi cantly extended welfare rights for women – whilst, however, neglecting paid father’s leave as an important way to promote gender equality amongst parents. New Labour also oversaw a wide- ranging reform of childcare and early- learning services focusing on the supply, aff ordability, quality, governance, and diversity of provider. Th e number of childcare places doubled between 1997 and 2007, and a number of measures were introduced to make childcare more aff ordable. Th ese measures had an important impact on families and, in particular, mothers, who increasingly worked full- time. New Labour also introduced the minimum wage, which benefi tted women most, as they made up the majority of low- paid workers. Another policy benefi tting primarily women was the creation of specialist domestic violence courts. At the same time, however, lone parents’ benefi ts were cut despite strong opposition from within the Labour Party. As the majority of single parents were (and continue to be) mothers, this policy hit some of the poorest and most vulnerable women.  Blair’s New Labour government also made some signifi -cant progress in promoting LGBTQ rights and equality. It brought the age of consent for homosexual men and women in line with that of heterosexual sex. Furthermore, the ban on LGBTQ people serving in the armed forces was ended. New Labour also extended adoption rights to LGBTQ individuals and couples and created civil partnerships. In 2003, New Labour also repealed Section 28 of the Local Government Act, which had banned local authorities and schools from ‘promoting homosexuality’. In 2005, New Labour’s Gender Recognition Act entered into force, allowing people with gender dysphoria to change their legal gender.  David Cameron and the representation of women’s and LGBTQ issues  When David Cameron became leader in 2005, the Conservative Party lacked electoral competitiveness on women’s and LGBTQ issues. Since the mid- 1990s, the Conservatives had lost younger women’s votes to New Labour. Indeed, conservative party manifestos from 1992 to 2005 depicted women mainly as caregivers and, mostly, as mothers, whereas men were depicted as inhabiting the public sphere (Childs et al.  2010 : 208– 211). Th ese images looked outdated for younger, working women.  David Cameron wanted to modernise the party and saw feminisation as part of this agenda. He was keen to get more female candidates elected to Parliament. Also, he wanted to appeal to female voters with a range of new policies focusing on the balancing of work and family life, combatting violence against women, and addressing women’s needs in the context of international development (Campbell and Childs  2015 ). His aim was to attract middle- income mothers (the so- called ‘ mumsnetters ’) as the party had now widely accepted women’s (and mothers’) entrance into paid employment (Childs and Webb  2012 : 123). Before being elected, Cameron had also claimed that a conservative government would be the ‘most family- friendly government ever’ (Annesley and Gains  2012 : 718).  Once elected, the Conservatives under Cameron’s lead-ership entered a coalition with the LibDems (2010– 2015) and, from 2015 onwards, ruled as a single- party government. Th eir policy record on women can be described as a ‘mixed bag’. On the one hand, domestically and internationally, the coalition government introduced a number of measures to address women’s health, combat violence against women, and support women in the developing world. For instance, stalking was made a specifi c criminal off ence, and an action plan was introduced to combat female genital mutilation. Moreover, a modern slavery bill was implemented in 2015 (Campbell and Childs  2015 : 160). In an eff ort to stress his commitment to the family and marriage as an institution, Cameron introduced a tax break for married couples (and 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   258 22-Apr-21   11:05:50Chapter 11 Gender and British politics 259civil partners) in 2015. His government also made fl exible working easier for women.  At the same time, spending on welfare benefi ts for the UK’s poorest families had shrunk by almost a quarter aft er nearly a decade of David Cameron’s austerity politics, and the bulk of these cuts hit the poorest hardest. Austerity had a disproportionate impact on women’s lives, as women use more public services and are the majority of welfare benefi t recipients. Th is is because women are more likely to be poor, a consequence of a looser attachment to the labour market due to their traditional role as unpaid carers. Women also make up the majority of the public- sector labour force (Women’s Budget Group  2018 ). Cuts to public spending and to public- sector jobs therefore made many women unemployed or work in low- paid and temporary jobs, which increased their fi nancial insecurity. Women are also more likely to have to make up for lost services by increasing the amount of unpaid care work they perform in looking aft er elderly, disabled or young family members. Women from ethnic minority backgrounds were hit even harder by austerity (Women’s Budget Group  2018 ).  During Cameron’s premiership, there were also elem-ents of social liberalism, as gay marriage was legalised in England and Wales. In February 2013, the House of Commons voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, although fewer than half of Conservative MPs backed David Cameron on the issue. Th e Prime Minister relied on the support of the LibDems and Labour, as there was considerable opposition within his own party, both in parliament and at the grassroots. Th at gay marriage became law under a conservative- led government surprised many; aft er all, the diff erent leaders of the Conservative Party since 1997 and up until Cameron’s leadership had been at best tolerant of gay rights. Here, David Cameron’s commitment to protecting the family as an institution through marriage, and his attempt to modernise the image of the Conservative Party, serve as explanations.  Theresa May and the representation of women’s and LGBTQ issues  Th eresa May publicly identifi ed as a feminist by wearing a t- shirt from the Fawcett Society, saying ‘Th is is what a feminist looks like’. She also co- founded  Women2Win , the conserva-tive group that supported David Cameron’s commitment to elect more women to parliament. Yet, her record on the pro-motion of women’s issues during her time as Home Secretary (2010– 2016) and Prime Minister (2016– 2019) has been described as ‘decidedly mixed’ (Kenny  2018 : 134). As Home Secretary, Th eresa May introduced legislation criminalising coercive control and ordered an enquiry into police treatment of domestic abuse cases. She also sponsored the Modern Slavery Act 2015, which sought to tackle human traffi  cking. On the other hand, she presided over a draconian immigra-tion regime and the indefi nite retention of pregnant women at Yarl’s Wood Immigration Centre (Kenny  2018 : 134). As Prime Minister, May was accused of failing to priori-tise women’s refuge services in spite of her claims to tackle domestic violence (Reeves  2020 ). As part of David Cameron’s austerity agenda, between 2010 and 2017, 17 per cent of spe-cialist women’s refuges had to be closed for lack of funding.  When it comes to LGBTQ issues, May’s voting behav-iour changed over time, following the party line. In 1998, she voted against reducing the age of consent for homosexual acts from eighteen to sixteen. However, she voted in favour of gay marriage in 2013. It is also worth mentioning that in 2018, May’s government launched a public consultation in order to understand gender recognition in more detail and explore ways in which the system created by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act could be improved. Th e government’s response was postponed to 2020 and thereby became Boris Johnson’s responsibility.  Boris Johnson and the representation of women’s and LGBTQ issues  Boris Johnson’s premiership (2019– ) has so far been dominated by Britain’s exit from the European Union and by Covid- 19. Both crises have gendered eff ects. For a start, the 2016 Brexit campaign was dominated by men, whilst women (and in particular, Th eresa May) were arguably left  to clean up the mess. Also, the potential implications of Brexit for gender and gender equality were left  out of the Brexit campaign. Boris Johnson, a key fi gure of the Vote Leave campaign, became leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister on the ‘get Brexit done’ ticket. Th e full political, economic, and social costs of Brexit remain unclear as the UK has not yet negotiated its future relationship with the EU. Still, experts warn that Brexit will have an impact on the UK’s social policy and, particularly, the gender equality framework. EU gender equality policies have played a signifi cant role in the member states’ labour market regulations. Guerrina and Masselot ( 2018 ) highlight two specifi c areas where women’s rights are likely to be weakened as a consequence of Brexit: maternity rights and gender balance in corporate boards. Indeed, the UK government’s position has restrained the EU’s ability to adopt more extensive maternity rights and stronger gender equality regulations. In both cases the UK government deployed the business argument in order to stop the ratifi -cation of new gender equality policies. Considering the UK’s past behaviour can help us understand continuity and change in government priorities in relation to EU and gender equality 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   259 22-Apr-21   11:05:50Politics UK Part 3 Representative process260policies. Brexit means that British equity standards are ‘likely to collapse without the EU minimum standards’ (Guerrina and Masselot  2018 : 325). As Boris Johnson’s government has been accused of being a ‘boy’s club’ it seems highly unlikely that it will focus its energy on introducing stronger maternity rights or other gender equality legislation.  EU membership has also had a very positive impact on sexual orientation and gender identity rights in the UK. Brexit, Dunne ( 2019 ) argues, is unlikely to fundamentally alter these existing rights and entitlements, as there are few (if any) movements to reduce or withdraw existing protections. Still, the UK’s LGBTQ community will be deprived of future EU rights developments.  In 2020, following a public consultation initiated by Th eresa May in 2018, the Johnson government ruled out changes to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. Ministers rejected calls from trans activists for people to be able to self- identify their gender and change their birth certifi cates without a medical diagnosis.  With regard to Boris Johnson’s response to Covid- 19, critics are highlighting the eff ects on women, who are signifi -cantly less likely to die from the virus but are bearing the brunt of the ensuing economic crisis. In their analysis of the gen-dered impact of Covid- 19, the Women’s Budget Group ( 2020 ) stresses that in the UK, women are the majority of frontline workers, the majority of the low- paid, and the majority of people with caring responsibilities, paid and unpaid. As a consequence, women are more likely to live in poverty, more likely to rely on public services and social security, and more likely to be exposed to the virus. What is more, as women from ethnic minorities are overrepresented in the health sector, they have suff ered disproportionately from Covid- 19. Whilst it is too early to judge Boris Johnson’s overall record on women’s and gender issues, we can nevertheless see that Brexit and Covid- 19 have aff ected, and will continue to do so, women diff erently than men, but that the gendered eff ects are largely ignored by a ‘boy’s club’ government.  The House of Commons: an inclusive working environment for women and the LGBTQ community?  Th e House of Commons is known for its antagonistic set- up: government (usually made up of a single party) and opposition sit opposite each other in the chamber. During public debates, the tone can be aggressive, as MPs from opposite sides shout, sneer and laugh at each other. In this climate, consensus between the government and the oppos-ition is rarely sought (and reached) and male and female MPs are used to having to stand their ground. Yet female MPs in particular are exposed to patronising and condescending language in the House of Commons, occasionally from the Prime Minister, and in front of the whole chamber and the TV audience. In 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron told Labour MP Angela Eagle to ‘calm down dear’ during Prime Minister’s Questions. Th is fuelled accusations by Labour’s deputy leader, Harriet Harman, that he was ‘patronising’ and had an ‘outdated attitude towards women’. In 2018, Boris Johnson (Foreign Secretary at the time) was told off  by the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, for being sexist. Johnson referred to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Th ornberry as ‘Lady Nugee’. ‘Th e shadow Foreign Secretary has a name, and it is not “Lady something”. We know what her name is. It is inappropriate and frankly sexist to speak in those terms, and I am not having it in this Chamber’, John Bercow insisted. Th ese are just two examples of the patronising and sexist discourses that are still used at the very top of the gov-ernment to put women in their place – in front of everybody.  Th e demeaning attitude towards women also manifests itself in the behaviour towards female staff  working at the Commons. In the aft ermath of the 2017 #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and sexual abuse, the House of Commons’ internal culture was in the news. A number of male frontbench and backbench MPs (from both the Conservative and Labour parties) resigned and/ or were suspended from their party over sexual misconduct. Th e most high- profi le case was that of defence secretary Michael Fallon, who resigned from his post in Th eresa May’s cabinet in November 2017, aft er allegations were made against him. In March 2018, the House of Commons Commission decided that there should be an enquiry into bullying and sexual har-assment inside the Commons. Th e report, written by Dame Laura Cox, stressed the gendered dimension of bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons: The bullying and harassment alleged, both against Members of Parliament and other members of House staff, and the complaints of lack of support from senior managers have an obvious gender dimension. The majority of the allegations, and almost all the allegations of sexual harassment […] are made by women still employed in the House, or who were formerly employed there.  (Cox  2018 : 69)  In August 2020, a (yet unnamed) Tory MP was arrested and interviewed by the police over rape and assault allegations, whilst a former Tory MP, Charlie Elphicke, was convicted for 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   260 22-Apr-21   11:05:50Chapter 11 Gender and British politics 261sexually assaulting two women, one of whom was a parlia-mentary aide. One of Elphicke’s victims reported the assault to Conservative party whips nearly one year before the police was called.  Th e fact that the House of Commons has not been a very inclusive workplace was already highlighted in Sarah Childs’s  2016 report, ‘Th e Good Parliament’. In the report, Childs makes 43 recommendations as to how to make the Commons a more diversity- sensitive workplace, in terms not only of gender, but also ethnicity, disability, and social class. Th e recommendations address three dimensions: ensuring the equality of participation, improving parliamentary infra-structure, and making the House of Commons’ culture more inclusive. Amongst the issues that Childs fl agged up are: the lack of diversity amongst MPs; the lack of women in the Commons’ leadership positions; parliament’s family- unfriendly working hours; the lack of proper parental leave provisions for MPs; and the culture inside the chamber. Th ese are all crucial points, as parliament should function as a role model for society.  UK media: a friendly environment for women and the LGBTQ community?  In Britain, the tabloid press is very widely read. Indeed, the right- wing  Th e Daily Mail and  Th e Sun are Britain’s bestselling newspapers. Both of them regularly trivialise, ridicule, and ‘other’ female political leaders. Th ere are many examples but let us concentrate on some of the most high- profi le cases.  When, in 1997, 101 female Labour MPs entered the House of Commons and the share of female MPs had doubled, the tabloid press referred to them as ‘Blair’s Babes’, thereby trivialising the female leaders. A few months before the 2010 general election,  Th e Daily Mail speculated on the future make- up of the Conservative Party by introducing readers to ‘Cameron’s Cuties: the 80 women likely to be among MPs in the Tories new woman friendly party.’ Later,  Th e Daily Mail also referred to the new intake of female MPs under Cameron’s leadership as ‘Dave’s Dolls’ and commented exten-sively on their physical appearance (Mavin et al.  2010 : 559). When Prime Minister Th eresa May and Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met to discuss Brexit in March 2017,  Th e Daily Mail published an opinion piece entitled ‘Never mind Brexit, who won Legs- It’. In this opinion piece, Vine wrote: ‘But what stands out here are the legs – and the vast expanse on show. Th ere is no doubt that both women consider their pins to be the fi nest weapon in their physical arsenal. Consequently, both have been unsheathed’. Vine and  Th e Daily Mail received much criticism for this ridi-culing portrait of Britain’s most powerful politicians. Nicola Sturgeon’s spokesperson was one of a string of politicians to criticise the tabloid over its headline, saying: ‘Brexit may risk taking Britain back to the early 1970s, but there is no need for coverage of events to lead the way’.  Whilst the British tabloid media oft en trivialises female political leaders, social media platforms have been accused of tolerating hate speech towards women. To be sure, aggressive Twitter ‘trolls’ have become a threat for many people in public life. Still, in the UK, female leaders are targeted more oft en and more violently than their male counterparts. As Dhrodia ( 2018 : 381) writes in her analysis of the 2017 gen-eral election campaign, ‘online abuse against women is oft en sexist or misogynistic in nature, and online threats of violence against women can be sexualised and usually include specifi c references to women’s bodies’. Th e study also highlights that Diane Abbot, a black Labour MP and at the time shadow Home Secretary, received by far the most abuse on Twitter: she alone received more abuse during the total period of analysis than all female MPs from the Conservative Party and Scottish National Party combined. Female MPs of Asian origin also receive a lot of abuse, regardless of their party affi  liation. Th is demonstrates that gender intersects with other characteristics, such as ethnicity, when it comes to online abuse. Indeed, much of the abuse that Diane Abbot and other female ethnic minority MPs receive on Twitter is both misogynistic and racist (Palmer  2019 ).  Religion also intersects with gender when it comes to online harassment. Luciana Berger, a former Labour MP, was exposed to antisemitic harassment which left  her fearing for her life. Six people were convicted of criminal off ences against her – four from the far right, two from the far left . In the end, Berger left  the Labour Party (and joined the LibDems) as she felt let down by the Labour leadership and her local party in the fi ght against antisemitism. Furthermore, a number of female conservative MPs decided against standing for re- election in 2019, citing online abuse as one of the reasons behind their decision. Harassment via social media is of course ‘only’ one aspect of violence against women in elections; there is also intimidation via e- mail; people loitering in candidates’ homes or other places they frequent; and sexual harassment. In their analysis of the 2017 general election candidate survey, Collignon and R ü dig ( 2020 ) found that four in every ten candidates experienced at least one type of harassment, and that female and young candidates were targeted in particular. Th e most horrifi c crime against a female politician was committed in the lead- up to the 2016 Brexit referendum. Labour MP Jo Cox was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency by a neo- Nazi who uttered the words ‘Britain fi rst’ and ‘keep Britain independent’ as he carried out 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   261 22-Apr-21   11:05:50Politics UK Part 3 Representative process262the attack. Cox had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union. Th us, for many people, but in particular for women, political campaigning and being in public offi  ce comes at a very high cost. If they speak out against misogyny and racism, they receive even more abuse.  For a long time, a vicious tabloid press culture of black-mail and exposure made life diffi  cult for the LGBTQ com-munity, especially if they wanted to participate in politics. For instance, Peter Tatchell, the Labour candidate for Bermondsey in 1983, was the subject of a homophobic campaign. Th e ‘outing’ of gay MPs and peers had become a tabloid staple. A change in attitudes towards the LGBTQ community happened in the 1990s. Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Michael Howard supported bringing down the age of consent for gay men from 21 to 18. When New Labour entered offi  ce in 1997, a number of LGBTQ candidates felt they could be open about their sexual orientation. Labour MP Chris Smith became the fi rst openly gay MP and Secretary of State (for culture, media and sport). Smith was also the fi rst political fi gure to admit to being HIV- positive. Th e centre- left  newspaper  Th e Guardian referred to Chris Smith as ‘the pioneer who changed gay lives’. Still, the right- wing tabloid press remained homo-phobic. In 1998,  Th e Sun screamed on its front page for Tony Blair to come clean about the ‘gay mafi a’ at the heart of British public life. It aft erwards vowed to no longer ‘out’ gay people ‘unless it was in the public interest’. Donna Smith ( 2012 ) argues in her study of the press coverage of LGBTQ politicians since the 1950s that there has been a steady move away from intolerance and ridicule since the late 1990s. Aft er all, public opinion about homosexuality has improved signifi cantly. What is more, Smith highlights that David Cameron brought with him a calmer and fairer approach to LGBTQ rights in the Conservative Party, and that the tone of media depictions has generally improved too. According to Smith, this indicates that the representa-tion of LGBTQ politicians in the British press will continue to improve, but that we still have to wait for being gay not to be newsworthy before gay MPs receive truly equal represen-tation in the press.  Chapter summary  Th is chapter has highlighted the slowly increasing feminisation of British politics that has taken place since the late 1990s. Th e number of women in Parliament at Westminster, in central government, and in the devolved parliaments and executives in Scotland and Wales is signifi cantly higher than it was 20 years ago. Northern Ireland is also beginning to catch up. In addition, British politics has become a more open environment for the LGBTQ community, as the number of openly LGBTQ politicians, including those in leadership positions, is increasing.  Despite such progress, a gender power imbalance persists, and particularly at Westminster, where female Secretaries of State remain in a minority and are oft en put in charge of the less prestigious, and lower- profi le, departments. Also, in parliament and the media – and in particular the right- wing tabloid press – female politicians are oft en patronised and trivialised, no matter how powerful they are. Most worryingly, increasing numbers of female candidates have been victims of harassment in recent years, and in particular those from ethnic and religious minorities. Whilst signifi cant progress has been made for women and the LGBTQ community when it comes to gender equality legislation and anti- discrimination policies over the past decades, the austerity agenda post- 2010, Brexit, and Covid- 19 have aff ected women disproportionately.  Discussion points  ■  In your opinion, should UK parties be legally obliged to introduce gender quotas for parliamentary elections?  ■  Why are Britain’s political parties (on average) unrepre-sentative of the population? What could they do to attract more diverse members?  ■  Why has the House of Lords, despite its poor gender balance, seen more women in leading roles than the House of Commons?  ■  How has the appointment or election of LGBTQ people aff ected British politics?  ■  Recent crises – austerity, Brexit, and Covid- 19 – have aff ected, and will continue to aff ect, women diff erently than men. Why have recent British governments let this happen?  Further reading  In recent years, the role of women in British politics has gained an increasing amount of attention. Labour MP Rachel Reeves ( 2020 ) has written a very accessible and up- to- date book on the female MPs who changed British politics. Furthermore, the longest- serving female MP, Harriet Harman ( 2017 ), has published her political autobiography describing the struggles 9780367464059c11-c14_p244-345.indd   262 22-Apr-21   11:05:50Chapter 11 Gender and British politics 263she experienced as a feminist Labour MP in a very male polit-ical environment since the 1980s. In addition, Childs ( 2004 ) has analysed the role of Labour MPs in feminising New Labour during the 1990s and early 2000s. Th e most exten-sive study into the feminisation of the Conservative Party was written by Childs and Webb ( 2012 ). Th ose interested in the role of women in the House of Lords might want to read Eason ( 2009 ). Meanwhile Mackay and McAllister ( 2012 ) and Murtagh ( 2008 ) have published very useful accounts on gender politics in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland post devolution. Th ose interested in how gender and race inter-sect in British politics might want to read Palmer ( 2019 ). Finally, Smith’s ( 2012 ) study into the British press’s (chan-ging) representation of LGBTQ politicians is intriguing, as is Robinson’s ( 2007 ) portrait of gay men and the Left  in post- war Britain.
