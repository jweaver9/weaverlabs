This study is a dedication and a love letter to all of my Black queer andtrans family members around the world that may be lost and still searching for their oasis.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 7AbstractIn this study, I have investigated the ways in which Black queer and trans students have (or havenot) fostered community, lived authentically, and benefitted from support of their identitydevelopment. I explored what support (or lack thereof) and identity development that existswithin the realm of predominantly White higher educational institutions as well as San Diegocommunity resources at large. This study approach consisted of conducting strategic outreach touniversities in San Diego, California, and building community circles to facilitate processes ofqualitative narrative analysis. This led to an intentional focus group dialogue space that allowedthe participants to put their wishes for Black queer thriving into voice and practice. This studywill provide a framework for future coalition building for Black queer and trans populations inthe San Diego area. This grants the opportunity to pioneer innovative and strategic collaborativemethods to move Black queer and trans students from a state of surviving to thriving.Keywords: Black, queer, thriving, coalition building, community building, identity development,San Diego, CaliforniaBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 8Blaqueer and Here: Black Queer and Trans Students’ Path to ThrivingThroughout my education journey, I continue to be committed to be aware of my sociallocation and positionality as it relates to the work in which I engage. In the scope of this field, Ibelieve it is important to always attend to this internal work as if neglected, then we will not beable to push ourselves further to be dynamic and effective leaders. Identity salience has alwaysbeen a constantly changing and evolutionary concept for me. The identities that are most presentto me are being Black, queer, and my relation to gender. This fact has not always been the case:Several experiences have influenced me up to this moment.I have an extensive background in student affairs work, community engagement, studentadvocacy, and leadership. I think beyond my professional background to what I see myself doingin the future. I look back at myself as an undergraduate student, excited and confused and attimes feeling as if I had to put on a mask. I am Black; I am queer. I am many things, but I feltlike I could not  be my entire self at the same time. When I was in “Black” spaces I could notexpress my queerness. My queerness was seen as too odd and not Black enough. My sexualitywas rejected from the culture because the culture is rooted in heteronormativity; only parts of mewere free. I found this odd because Blackness itself is inherently queer, although it is notacknowledged as such within academia and broader society. When I was in queer spaces, thesespaces were often too White-dominated to accept my Blackness. My Blackness was seen as apiece of property to take, manipulate, abuse, and colonize for White consumption. My Blacknesswas seen as secondhand. I want to be an advocate for the future students who will come intocollege looking for an escape but then find themselves having to hide most of the time that theyare there anyway.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 9I remember participating in and cocreating a pilot community series at the University ofMassachusetts Amherst called At the Intersections of Queer & Black, sponsored by the StudentBridges Agency and Stonewall Center, right before the infamous coronavirus global crisis hadstruck the masses. This event was an opportunity for Black queer students to come together andshare their distinct experiences and connect with one another. Everyone at the first gathering toldstories, but many of the narratives involved wrestling with the two identities of being Black andqueer in different spaces that advertised themselves as being inclusive. There was a sense ofcomfort and hurt that came with realizing that you were not alone, but there was still muchinternal suffering that was left unhealed. This moment was a defining point that inspired me towant to work towards lessening the struggles of having to negotiate identities.I would argue that Black queer and trans students often have to negotiate with theiridentity, not only in nonBlack spaces but also in Black communities. There is also a lack ofstrategic initiatives for student development and support at higher levels of educationadministration; intersectionality is often overlooked or misconstrued. This leaves individualswith multiple existing marginalized identities with more difficulty in developing navigationaland social capital in a higher education setting. Poet Tianna Bratcher (personal communication,February 15, 2021) during an event called Black LGBTQ+ Poetry in Motion, hosted by theBlack Student Union and LGBTQ+ and Allies Commons at the University of San Diego put intoplain terms that: “Homophobia and transphobia do not belong to us; they are constructions ofwhite supremacy.” Higher education institutions and community organizations now claim to lookfor ways to be antiracist and actively work to dismantle white supremacy. However, they mustmore deeply examine and analyze how they serve marginalized populations. Educationalinstitutions were not made to serve marginalized communities in the first place and communityBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 10organizations must remember their missions at the core. Part of that work is incorporating a moreintentional intersectional lens into initiatives. In order to stay true to dismantling whitesupremacist structure then we must make sure we are not leaving Black queer and trans studentsout of the conversation when we want to advocate for more inclusive practices and policies.Being previously employed at a predominantly White private Catholic institution wastiring with the identities I hold, but my circumstances were what lit a fire within me. My familywas devoutly Christian, but, because of these beliefs, I was shut out because of my queeridentity, and I used the university as an escape. I am passionate to serve those students who lookfor the same escape but still encounter obstacles in a place that was supposed to be their oasis.My calling is what I see in the future and that calling is truly serving those I see myself in. I hopein this work to challenge the norm and to go beyond what is deemed as respectable or acceptablein academia. I yearn for voices and experiences to be given a space and to be amplified to adegree they have not been amplified before. I want the overlooked to be seen and to be deemedas valid. I desire for the work and knowledge I produce to serve as inspiration for practitioners at4-year institutions as well as community organizers regarding how they approach intersectionalwork when it comes to intentionality around support for Black queer and trans students. Ichallenge those who want to engage in true social justice work to consider what support lookslike beyond just providing sporadic and inconsistent space for Black queer and trans students. Ienvision a future in which we work to transform spaces, values, and missions that center andaccept multi-existing identities.In this study, I explored existing Black queer and trans affinity spaces or groups and theirstructures for building community and support. I examined the ways in which these spaces areand are not supported. This led to me being in community with a collective of Black queer andBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 11trans students in San Diego, California, where in this space we started to foster belonging andsupport for one another. The problems I have addressed are the lack of access to suitable spacesfor Black queer and trans individuals, old ideas and practices that contribute to identity erasureand white supremacy, the impact of ignoring intersectionality when it comes to Black queer andtrans individuals. I also engaged in conversations to discover how genuine community can bebuilt among Black queer and trans individuals.BackgroundBecause I address student support, It’s imperative to take into account studentdevelopmental theories that have been revisited over the years. I put the Black studentdevelopment model (Cross & Fhagen-Smith, 2001; Cross et al., 2002) in conversation with queertheory in education (Kasch, 2013) to support Black queer and trans students. I focus on usingqueer specifically because of the critical political and historical background the word providesfor Black people versus LGBT+ people. In this study, I use queer as a tool of resistance againstthe Whiteness that has seeped into the language of the LGBTQ+ community. This workingdefinition comes from personal lived experiences and prominent activists in the Black queer andtrans community. Queer centers the Black experience as it is inherently queer as aforementioned.Afterwards, I introduce a queered model of Black racial identity development (Johnson &Quaye, 2017) to tie and solidify these concepts together. Because Black and queer exist at anintersection, I would be remiss not to include background regarding holding identitiessimultaneously. I reintroduce intersectionality as a grounding concept but provide context to helpadvocates move beyond base use of this theory to use of a postintersectional lens. For context, Iwill include not only an overview of the origins of intersectionality work (Crenshaw, 1989) andits importance (Duran et al., 2019) but also additional scholarship regarding productiveBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 12postintersectionality framework (Cho, 2013) and its application within an education context(Coleman et al., 2019). Then, I examine literature and material evidence of practices (Blockett,2017) that contribute to Black queer and trans individuals thriving (Schreiner, 2010) as a meansto suggest creating radical spaces of support (Rodriguez, 1998) that lie outside of the realm of aninstitution. Then, I will explore the limited scholarship on blaqness/blaqueerness (Wilson, 2020)as a means of further examining the ways in which Black queer individuals exist. I use theliterature to unravel a guiding question of how effective and exceptional support can begenerated inside of a continuing oppressive system for Black queer and trans students.Black Student Development in Conversation With Queer TheoryIn their Black student development model, Cross et al. (2002) revealed that Black identityis composed of generational transfers of learned experiences and identity that facilitate Blackadaptation and humanity under conditions often formed by race, racism, and the complexdimensions of Black culture.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 13Figure 1Cross and Fhagen-Smith Model of Black Identity DevelopmentNote. Adapted from Cross et al. (2002)Queer theory does not focus on the identity that is queer but rather undergoes ananalyzation of criticality as it relates to intersectional identities and provides a framework ofresisting oppressive systems influencing sexual orientation and gender (Kasch, 2013). Kasch(2013) suggested a more vigorous use of queer theory to reimagine the model of multipledimensions of identity derived from critical race theory and intersectionality to offer aperspective on identity and interactions within as ever changing, evolving, and complex. Usingqueer theory and the logic of Kasch (2013) as a basis, this model can be used in tandem withBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 14Black student development to gain a more analytical and critical understanding of Black queerand trans student development in higher education. In recent scholarship, Johnson and Quaye(2017) declared the popular Black racial identity development model (Cross & Fhagen-Smith,2001) is very linear and advocated for the use of queer theory to understand the nuances andfluidity in Black student development rather than just through direct life progressive stages.Johnson and Quaye (2017) went on to establish a queered model of Black racial identitydevelopment in higher education, adopting themes from critical race theory, queer theories, andvarying racial/intersecting identity models. A queered version of Black student developmentlooks at race performance, socialization, assimilation, adaptation to contextual environments, theprocess of becoming, and resistance of societal norms (Johnson & Quaye, 2017).Figure 2Queered Model of Black Racial Identity DevelopmentNote. From Johnson and Quaye 2017.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 15Imagining With and Beyond IntersectionalityAs previously suggested, intersectionality reflects the multiple dimensions of identity thatexist in one’s life. Intersectionality as a concept exposes the ways in which those with multiplemarginalized identities are impacted uniquely and distinctly by an assemblage of oppressivesystems (Crenshaw, 1989). Intersectionality over the years has been reimagined and reapplied toidentities beyond Black women in the legal context. However, there is limited scholarly workdone on Black queer students in this manner. The work that has been done tends to depend on apower-neutral perspective diminishing the realities of the impact that oppressive systems have onBlack queer and trans individuals in a higher education context (Duran et al., 2019). In order tomove beyond a power-neutral lens as an effective base for understanding Black queer students,structural intersectionality and postintersectional thought is required. Through domains of powerand matrix thinking, intersectionality reveals that lived experiences, structural systems,marginalization, power, and resistance all interact simultaneously in complex ways (Duran et al.,2019). There have been many conflicts in terms of intersectionality as an effective means toincorporate sexuality and suggestions that critique limits intersectionality application (Cho,2013). Intersectionality has been critiqued to be heteronormative but work has been done for theapplication of the concept to transcend heteronormativity (Cho, 2013). However, there is acritique of how intersectionality is not being prioritized in the aspects of higher education as itpertains to Black queer and trans students; thus falling into a path of viewing a group of Blackstudents or queer students through a monolithic view (Coleman et al., 2019). This suggests thatscholarship critique of intersectionality in tandem with race and sexuality should be focusedmore on the application of the concept rather than its effectiveness.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 16Understanding Blaqness/BlaqueernessThe construction of Blackness as an opposing concept is used in order to legitimize andposition whiteness on a spectrum of superiority and power (Guess, 2006) but also to understandthe ways in which Black culture and means of existing play a critical role in society. Theexistence of queerness exists to interrupt heteronormativity and the institutions/channels thatcontinue to give it power as a political force (Kasch, 2013). Black queer community membershave created the term “Blaqueer” as an alternative identification (Levounis & Yarbrough, 2020),but Wilson (2020) gave us a preview of what will it mean as a concept and/or theory developedwithin the academy to better inform how Black queer individuals exist and navigate in the worldand the ways they are uniquely impacted by it. Wilson (2020) introduced how Black and Blackqueer (BlaQueer) people exist both in and outside of law. Similar to Crenshaw (1998), Wilson(2020) used intersectionality as a theoretical framework to shed light that law must be viewedmultidimensionally using Black thought, Black queer and feminist theory, critical race theory,and performance theories. All of these intersecting and critical frameworks are used to providethe argument that within law, Black queer people are deemed are furtive, in other words,overlooked and avoided and easily subjects of criminalization in judicial institutions (Wilson,2020). Thus, using similar logic, Black queer students in higher education, another form of aninstitution, are also often overlooked and come across as an afterthought when looking toprovide concrete support for their development and collegiate experience.Path to Black Queer and Trans Students ThrivingThriving as it pertains to college students falls in between the areas of having aspirations,increased engagement in academic environments, commitment to self-reflection and learning,BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 17establishing sustainable and substantial connections and willingness to diversify theircommunities (Schreiner, 2010). For queer communities of color, more specifically Black queerindividuals, Darling-Hammond (2019) found that there were five main dimensions of thriving:Community, Selfhood, Sufficiency, Relief, and Pleasure. These five dimensions that DarlingHammond (2019) discovered had a recurring theme that when Black queer students “were ableto show up as their whole selves unapologetically, without bowing to social norms, they enactedthe logic of simply being, even though the threat of oppressive retaliation from society at largehovered at the periphery” (p. 424). Blockett (2017) found that sociopolitical circumstances thatspecifically Black queer and transgender college men are forced to navigate often discouragethem from fully engaging with the rest of a heteronormative predominantly white campus. It wassuggested that Black queer men are labored into creating alternative spaces to resist socialexclusion (Blockett, 2017) and the same could fairly be generalized and applied to all Blackqueer individuals who exist among the entire gender spectrum. These spaces were found to becreated outside the scope of an institutionalized resource and mainly peer-supported (Blockett,2017). Rodriguez (1998) stated that within education systems, queer students must be viewedbeyond just a social category but as a site of politics and critical pedagogy. There must beopportunities for queer students to be able to engage in their own dialogue and understanding ofthemselves in relation to queerness as a form of radical progress (Rodriguez, 1998). For theseopportunities of dialogue and understanding to be effectively in place, these interrelations ofqueerness must be connected to other subcultures, groups, and identities as queer theory at itscore centers intersectional impacts of varying oppressive structures (Kasch, 2013; Rodriguez,1998). Once critical examinations of how queerness can be linked to other struggles of othersocial categories is done, then processes of imagining what necessary coalitions need to exist canBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 18commence (Rodriguez, 1998). Darling-Hammond (2019) supports this claim through queer ofcolor epistemologies that reveal dimensions of FUBU (“for us by us”). To further expand onwhat Darling-Hammond (2019) means by this is that there is a need for “sensibility; applicationof mutuality, collectivity, and activism as community practices; critical consciousness; anddisruptive modes of self-assertion and refusal that promote relief, pleasure, and healing” (p.425).Since critical examinations of how queerness is linked to other struggles rarely happen withineducation institutions, this brings the question of whether effective support can exist within therealms of an institution but rather as an entity that lies outside of it.ContextAlthough the background provides a framework for understanding the ways in whichBlack queer students exist in this world, it is not entirely stable and is surface level in terms offinding the core of what true support looks like for Black queer students. Scholarship hasexplained that institutions were not made to serve marginalized and oppressed populationsespecially in the realm of higher education. For years, practitioners have struggled to provideexceptional support for non cis-hetero white students within higher education institutions, andthus we may have to look elsewhere. Black queer students often find themselves strugglingdevelopmentally and with the added oppressive powers that exist within higher education, thatdevelopment will continue to be hindered across the board. I went into the research with manyassumptions about what I will find and was honored to be given a wealth of information thatbrings this scholarship even further. I originally had the focus be on only what higher educationalinstitutions can do but the problem goes beyond that and involves community support as welldepending on geographic region. Throughout my findings I had the opportunity to engage inBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 19conversations around support for Black queer students’ sense of belonging and ability to bepresent authentically.Project RationaleMy target participants is Black, queer, and trans students attending a predominantlywhite/nonhistorically Black college or university institution in San Diego County, California(University of San Diego and/or San Diego State University). I initially came up with the idea offorming an intercollegiate collective in October 2020 under my former role at the University ofSan Diego and introduced it to the San Diego State University Blacq Space student leadership.Blacq Space (2019) is a student-led initiative that “foster[s] community, dialogue and healing forBlack lesbians, gays, bisexuals & trans and questioning folxs w/ additional identities in theLGBTQIA+ [community].” The students articulated this has been a need for some time but thereis not much support to make it happen. I have measured my participants’ ability to be authenticin varying space and was able to investigate the ways in which community has been (or notbeen) formed and any preexisting connections to other Black queer and/or trans students in theSan Diego area more deeply than I anticipated. Lastly, I measured the level of support given bytheir current institution. The metrics of support are as follows: spaces for community,commitment to intersectionality/anti identity-erasure, wellness resources, referrals to institutionaland/or noninstitutional resources.I began the process by getting in contact with staff and administrators of the Blackresource centers, multicultural centers, and LGBTQ+ resource centers on guidance beforestarting my official study (and/or distributing a pre-initial interest survey for participants with anincentive). I made myself as vulnerable, accessible and authentic as possible to gain trust andbuild real relationships with my participants. Figure 3 outlines my relationship building process.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 20Figure 34C Approach to Relationship Building & Study ExecutionNote. Created by author, Updated April 2022Study DesignMy overarching design relied on qualitative data. This method was most valuablespecifically to my study as I was able to gain information through real life narratives. Aftercollection of these narratives through the community circles from the preceding section, Iengaged in deeper reflection as well as some additional review of literature to support andunderstand my findings.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 21My epistemological stance for this study has been done through a balance of criticaltheory and constructivism. I used critical theory as a foundational base of learning for thepopulation I am studying about, while making myself, the principal investigator, visible in theprocess. I leaned on constructivist methods as I was gaining new knowledge of others throughtheir personal narratives and experiences and how it has shaped their realities. Mymethodology centered real life student experiences and a practice of communitylearning/coalition building based on logic of Rodriguez (1998) that within education systemsqueer students must be viewed beyond just a social category but as a site of politics andcritical pedagogy.Data Collection and InterventionsFirst, I conducted a preliminary needs analysis with San Diego area administrators andstaff. Then I hosted an initial community-building event as a part of that process through myposition at the University of San Diego. From there, I extended invitations to speak withdifferent Black queer and trans students in the San Diego area through a more intentionalqualitative data collection process. I created a focus group and collective that created a basisfor other organizations to follow for a coalition-building space in the future.I used a slightly modified version (see Figure 5) of Kolb’s Experiential learning cycle(see Figure 4). Within this cycle included the following: Active Experimentation, ConcreteExperience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualisation. Kolb’s Experiential learningcycle defines the different levels of engagement as the following (McLeod 2017):1. Concrete experience is where a new experience occurs, or a reinterpretation of anexisting experience.2. Reflective observation of the new experience to distinguish if there are anyBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 22inconsistencies between experience and understanding.3. Abstract conceptualization reflection proposes a new idea, or an alteration of anexisting abstract concept.4. Active experimentation is where the learner applies their idea(s) to the world and theirenvironment to observe the outcome..Figure 4Kolb’s Experiential Learning CycleNote. Retrieved from McLeod 2017I carried out active experimentation (phase I) by planning my project through anextensive literary analysis, conducting initial preliminary needs assessment with San Diegocampus representatives and event planning for the next step. In concrete experience (phase I) isthe initial event that exposed students to each other as well as me as a co-participant. Next, Iinformally did a reflective observation (phase I). From this point, I went back to activeexperimentation (phase II) where I planned for outreach to select participants for more intimatequalitative data collection.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 23Figure 5Modified Kolb’s Experiential Learning CycleNote. Created by authorAfter I recruited interested participants, I moved back into concrete experience (phase II)as well as reflective observation (phase II) simultaneously (see Figure 3 for community buildingpractices). During this stage I used strategies obtained from a licensed psychologist about traumainformed practices that initiated safe and vulnerable conversations as data collection. After doingqualitative data collection, I did an extension of reflective observation ( phase III) and reviewedsome literature to further support the qualitative data collected beforehand. Once I gathered allthe data, I shared the data with core participants of active experimentation phase II (Black QueerTrans Circles) to begin a process of collective abstract conceptualisation of what is needed tosupport the Black queer trans community further.Pre-Study Anticipated Outcomes and AssumptionsAssumptions I held before the study is that the narratives and experiences Black queerBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 24students are facing are going to be similar to mine. Because I am connected to this projectholding the identities I hold, it was  a challenge for me to not impose what I am alreadycoming into the process with. How I challenged these assumptions was by going into thefocus group with an open mind and reminding myself that I am co-creating knowledge withmy participants. I did not come in with a mindset that I am better informed simply because ofmy status as a principal investigator. By doing this I was able to build rapport andrelationships more organically.I frequently checked in with my colleagues and personal community to hold meaccountable and discussed any challenges I was facing so I was not doing this completely onmy own. My anticipated outcome of the experience is that it will plant a seed for futurecoalition building between Black queer and trans students in the San Diego area. I initiallyanticipated the study would start off small with the relation building through programmingand then afterward it would be used as a template and guide for how to envision concretesupport for Black queer and trans students to contribute to their thriving.TimelineThe timeline of this study predates this paper to November 2020, which in partcontributed to the Project Rationale. An initial needs assessment was determined when Iconnected with San Diego State University’s Blacq Space student leadership about my visionof connecting Black queer and trans students in the San Diego area. Between then and April2021 was a period of expanding my network and colleague relations in the San Diego areaand developing more of the idea of what this project process and proposal will look like. Iconducted another needs assessment in the same month by attending the San Diego areaLGBT+ Community Days zoom conference to better familiarize myself with the existingBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 25resources in the area.Up until June 2021, I have done outreach to campus representatives at the fourinstitutions using my status as a Graduate Assistant working in Student Affairs at theUniversity of San Diego. I also used this time to apply for funding to use for incentives for myfocus group participants. While I waited for IRB approval, I edited existing programdevelopment material to tailor to my study that I first began during my first months workingin the Black Student Resource Commons. Along with this, I created a marketing plan andreached out to various San Diego campus stakeholders about my initial community-buildingevent.In November 2021, I hosted a mixer social event for all Black queer and trans studentsin the San Diego area. From the participants of that event, I extended an informal invitation toparticipate in Black Queer Trans (BQT) circles. After collecting this data, I reconnected withparticipants of BQT circles in March 2022 about future envisioning of the space and discussedfuture ideas of coalition building or other forms of sustainable support. April-May 2022 wasdedicated to data analysis. My hopes for the future is that the group will continue to meet,build relationships, and imagine collective support for the Black queer and trans communityhere in San Diego, California beyond the study.Results and FindingsThe study yielded lots of rich information and data that I was able to work with. Theoriginal timeline of the study had to be extended approximately 3-4 more months thananticipated due to a delayed IRB process and extended recruitment period for my participants.This modification to my timeline did not have any large hindrance on the analysis of my data.All of the following data occurred during a focus group that was held in March 2022 in the BlackBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 26Student Resource Commons at the University of San Diego. The space was reserved and closedoff for only study participants for the entirety of the focus group. The focus group consisted offive participants (with one withdrawing prior to the process) with each member contributing adifferent amount of vocal air time to the space. A pre-study survey of their demographicinformation was distributed for them to complete in order to consider for the analysis of the data.Each participant was given the opportunity to select their own pseudonym to protect theiridentity.The group was made up of a variety of different students that varied in age (see Table A).Most of the participants were in their 20’s (with the exception of one participant) falling withineither the Generation Z or Millenial category.Table AParticipant Information & AgeParticipant Name AgeDr. JT 22Cameron West 32Tasha Martin 26Eve 27Dashaun 24Participant X 20Note: Created by authorThe original focus of the study was going to be tailored towards only undergraduatestudents but was then later decided to expand to all types of students prior to IRB submission.This allowed me to recruit more participants. I found that more graduate students felt called toparticipate versus undergraduate students (see Table B). This may be directly related to whereBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 27students may be on their identity development journey as in the original Black Racial IdentityDevelopment model suggests that these developmental stages come with time, age in tandemwith ongoing occurrences and experiences an individual may encounter. This could also be theexplanation as to why “Participant X” withdrew from the focus group portion of the study.Figure 6Participant Student StatusNote: Generated information from survey resultsAlthough the study called specifically for Black queer and/or trans individuals it’simportant to note how the participants noted their race/ethnicity. Each participant eitheridentified as Black, African-American, or Black alongside a specified ethnicity. This goes toshow how even within the Black community when it came time to identify under a race there arestill nuances at play in terms of language or someone’s personal background/connection to raceand ethnicity.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 28Table BParticipant Race/Ethnicity MakeupNote: Generated information from survey resultsHaving this be a study grounded in queer theory, gender is also at play here. The studyhad a diverse makeup of how people identified themselves in terms of gender. There seems to bea balance of individuals who identify as a man or a woman along with those who see themselvesas more gender fluid/gender expansive. What is notable in this data is that only one personselected cisgender even though six people took this presurvey. This data suggests that there maybe more gender fluidity or questioning of gender within the group than what the data explicitlytells us. Nobody had selected transgender or nonbinary even though this was proven to be falseas some individuals touched on the possibility of this being true during the focus group.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 29Table CParticipant Gender Identity MakeupNote: Generated information from survey resultsWhat was really interesting to see that when it came time for asking about sexual identitythe majority of the group had identified with the more umbrella term “queer” rather than anotheridentifier on the LGBTQ+ spectrum. This goes to show that sexual identity is very fluidespecially when speaking to the sexual identity of Black queer and trans individuals. Thestudents from this study seemed to find that this was a way to embrace the fluidity that camealive during some of the conversations in the focus group that occurred.Table DParticipant Sexual Identity/Orientation MakeupNote: Generated information from survey resultsBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 30Notable ThemesWhen breaking down the focus group notes were done in five distinct categories. Thecategories being: What participants need, What people did in the space, What was noticed,What were named obstacles, and what were named values. I also took notes based on themetrics I had stated in my project rationale: spaces for community, commitment tointersectionality/anti identity-erasure, wellness resources, referrals to institutional and/ornoninstitutional resources.Starting with the needs of the participants, this spanned across lots of different categories.Participants expressed a lot of specifics but when you take what was said it came down to twosub categories of what people need for themselves and what people need from others. Forthemselves participants expressed need for romance & pleasure, having wealth of safety andsocial connections and having their own connections and relationship with spirituality.“Wealth and healing. Not financial wealth, but social wealth, friendship wealth, andsafety wealth and an abundance of safety in different spaces that I'm in because I don'tnecessarily feel like I feel an abundance of safety and support. For healing not onlyhours of therapy but being able to personally heal my injured inner child if that makessense. Because I feel like that that's never going to heal though if I take the time to makethat happen personally” - Dr. JT, personal communications, March 2022The essence of what JT is saying here follows a recurring theme throughout the focusgroup conversation: the dual need for genuine community and safety. As a queer, Black personits dfficult to have access to safety and community. When given opportunities to buildcommunity in a safe way, then a process of envisioning a thriving future can occur.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 31With these needs the individual will be able to have the opportunity to develop their ownsense of selfhood which was a requirement of thriving as defined by Darling-Hammond (2019).Figure 7Requirements of Self vs ExternalNote: Created by authorFrom others, it was identified that participants seek affirmation, solidarity and sustainablesupport networks. Affirmation was a big thing among the group as participants spoke to notbeing able to have a lot of that validation growing up. Eve spoke about their relationship withtheir father and how affirmation was really important to them and it translates to other parts oftheir life. This is really important when it comes to solidarity when initiative is taken by nonqueer Black folks to offer support without them having to be told to do so.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 32“I felt really appreciated and really validated when [my father] goes back, andapologizes for past and current traumas. And he, like, brings it up himself. It's like, I'mnot directing the conversation. He'll just call me one day and randomly say, I'm sorry,or is this how you feel, or just how it happened? I think that that, for me, really makes mefeel very appreciated in that identity” - Eve, personal communications, March 2022What was happening for Eve in this moment were expressions of gratitude for how muchaffirmations were valuable to her in feeling solidified in her identity. This worked hand in handfor a need of having an opportunity for healing her inner child especially since these specificmoments had to do with past traumas.One unexpected finding that came from the group was that a very big thing that wasneeded was time. This meant time to figure yourself out, time to find community, time to heal.Time seemed to be a concept that the participants didn’t have a grasp of because of all the manythings they have to juggle on a daily basis for survival.“…I've been dividing or compartmentalizing everything…one of the things that Ichallenged myself to do is bring it all together…queer, romantic stuff was at the bottom,because, I mean, it just takes a lot of time that I don't have. So for me to imagine, beingblack and queer all day long [and] everybody being fine with it, and it's just a naturalthing…I can't conceptualize that.” - Cameron West, personal communications, March2022Cameron shared during the focus group that he was constantly on the move and trying tofigure out what was next for him. It appears that Cameron, due to his unique experience, has toprioritize things in his life that may not necessarily give him relief or pleasure, which is a definedcategory of thriving by Dr. Darling-Hammond. From this, it can be concluded that Cameron isBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 33searching for a way for all of his identities to co-exist and blend together as one without it feelinglike a burden.From the conversations that happened I was able to discover what people valued the mostand some obstacles to thriving. Some people’s values were community, being validated inacademia, when “allies” take initiative, and non performative gestures. When these are at playthis feeds directly into the requirements of external support that were expressed multiple timesthroughout the focus group. However, obstacles come up that can interfere with this. Classdisparities are one of them which has a direct connection to the San Diego area. Within educationspaces, white supremacist thought has a direct negative implication of Black queer studentsbeing able to thrive and feel like their values are being met. When values aren’t being met thenthere is a need for healing however limited access to wellness resources within the institution andoutside of it poses a challenge to that. On top of that gender dysphoria was also mentioned asthere isn’t enough space to explore gender fluidity and identity within spaces that prioritizecis-gendered norms. Finally, there was also an expression of tensions with the hypocrisy ofChristianity and how this had a negative impact on the participants’ connection to spirituality.Lastly there is the observation and analysis of what participants did in the space and whatI noticed as a researcher. On questions that asked the participants to reflect on positives it wassomehow changed to think about the negatives which is an indication of how queer Black peoplearen’t given much opportunity to reflect on the what could be and imagine a future of possibility.When discussing authenticity every single participant had their own definition. They spoke towhere they had to adapt in  different environments for survival which meant they had to sacrificetheir authenticity. This is a direct indicator people were able to express their own authenticitywithin the group and not have to do any cultural assimilation. It’s also important to note in theBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 34midst of all of this is that every single participant is originally not from San Diego. Everyparticipant indicated that being in San Diego and its environment has done a lot of harm to theirown identity development and exploration as a Black queer person and wonder aboutgeographically relocating.“I just felt like, there's been so many times in my life where I had to question my ownauthenticity, and I feel like it's still like developing to this day…when I revealed I'mqueer it's like, oh, no, we can't have that here (hometown). Even to this day, like, youknow, being in San Diego, it's kind of like how I show up here. And like, at this, school,or just in the city is like way different than how I was showing up on the east coast. Soit's kind of like, yeah, I still have a big question mark of like, what is authentic? For me,in the context of San Diego as a black queer person” - Dashaun, personalcommunications, March, 2022Authenticity and location cross at an intersection here for Dashaun. It is hard for Dashaunto define authenticity as Dashaun expressed that he shows up differently in each space. Whatwould be beneficial for Dashaun is the opportunity for him to explore more of his identities nomatter where he is while having the safety and access to do so.In a beautiful final analysis is what participants actively did in the space. The theme ofthe research was how do we get Black queer and trans individuals to a state of thriving. What theparticipants expressed what they needed to get there mirrored what happened within the focusgroup. There were lots of laughter breaks, affirmation of one another, respectfully challengingeach other, celebrations of one another and the willingness to want to connect with others theydon’t know. After the official study was done there was a desire to still connect afterwardBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 35because that is how much people were yearning for community and to be able to connect withothers they share commonalities with.LimitationsOne major limitation to the study is that the exact script was not followed. The generalpremise of the questions were asked but in a way that continued the natural flow of the focusgroup. As the researcher, it was deemed more acceptable to let the focus group run its naturalcourse as it was supposed to be a reflection of what thriving could be. This limitation could alsobe seen as a strength for the study as this method allowed for more rich and authentic data to berevealed.Another limitation of the study is that it was composed of a small intimate group that hadmet only once. During the focus group that was used for this study, the participants wanted tostay for longer and converse more. This would have most likely led to deeper and more richconversations. Due to the nature of the timeline and the study, this didn’t allow for any morecycles to be added to the research design. The goal and hope of the study is to be able to createmore of those spaces to be accessible for Black queer and trans individuals to pratice thriving,freedom and authenticity with one another.One last limitation to the study is that there could have been more of a balance of the agerange/student status. I believe because of this it could have had a huge impact on how the data ispresented especially since individuals may be at different stages in their identity development.However, because of this it allowed more dynamic conversations to occur and participants wereable to learn from each other’s experiences which in return should have a positive impact ontheir own individual identity development.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 36RecommendationsOne major recommendations for higher education professionals specifically is to havemore programming for Black queer individuals that are student led. The student-led piece isimportant as it may be easier to establish trust and be comfortable with a peer versus someone ina formal authority. This was well received when the informal mixer happened and when I led thefocus group and included myself within the study rather than as an observer or an isolatedfacilitator. In order for higher education professionals to pull this off, being able to build upstudent leadership that are able to create these groups are key. This isn’t to say to put all the laboron to students but rather give them ample opportunities and guidance in doing so. This plays intothe solidarity aspect especially if you are not a member of this community. This all goes withbuildinging relationships, if you’re able to establish the connections and show your authentic selfthen they will too.For community organizations, it is important to note how the dynamic of yourorganization is and how it is being received by the public. Your organization makeup shouldclosely mirror the population you are serving and in this case, Black queer trans people. Inaddition to that, you must be willing to be open and accepting of new members. It is easy oncesomeone finds a community they want to keep this community close knit. In order for people toget to a state of thriving, a genuine community needs to be formed and this includes beingwelcoming to new members. This should be followed up with messages, social media outreach,community events that have intentional community building activities in them. Communityorganization events should encourage people to step outside of their comfort zones that don’tjeopardize their safety.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 37“I want my life to be a reflection of my values. And I want ,you know, and so for me,that looks like having a life where not only am I, you know, professionally satisfied, butthere's a balance of ease, you know, where I'm in integrity with, you know, creatingsustainability for black people, but I'm also creating it for myself to enjoy, you know,and where I have relationships in, in my life that yeah, are well connected, but also arefulfilling to me.” - Tasha Martin, personal communications, March 2022Having shared values and building sustainable relationships is what is key here. Whatoften can happen is that there may be opportunities available but they are not sustainable. Thereneeds to be systems in place for people who share similar identities and can build with oneanother on their values in order to keep relationship building opportunities alive. This doesn’ttake one person or group but rather a whole community to come together to make this possible.For both education professionals and community advocates, a big thing to keep in mindfor Black queer thriving is making sure you are having wellness resources readily available oratleast knowledgeable about which resources to take up on. Wellness and building on spiritualityis a big theme that emerged within this study. Black queer and trans individuals are a veryvulnerable population and it must be taken seriously when it comes to wellness and engaging inspiritual practices.ConclusionThis study was a much needed study and it is safe to say that it is not complete. Like theparticipants indicated there is a need for more time. More time to think, brainstorm, organize,build with each other on how to imagine a better future to freedom for Black queer individuals.We can take away that in order to imagine a better future, we must be willing to put in the workto support one another in our identity development. It doesn’t take one person but all of us toBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 38co-liberate with each other. “When we live in a world where dehumanization is normalized, weare all at risk” (Alva, 2021).’ We shouldn’t be left to resort to survival but rather thriving.Thriving must come naturally and having the ability to “cultivate genuineness in day to daythings” (Tasha Martin, personal communications, March 2022). My hope for the future is moremovement on making secure thriving communities of Black queer trans individuals sustainable.BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 39ReferencesAlva, Rachel.

In this letter I will include thefollowing:● A little bit about myself● The nature of the study● Logistics and next stepsPlease don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to potentiallyworking with you!About MeI am an unapologetic gender-fluid Black queer graduate student in the Higher Education Leadershipprogram at the University of San Diego. I also work in the Black Student Resource Commons as theGraduate Assistant and co-run the space with the director. I hold a strong interest in advocating for equityin educational settings and success for underrepresented populations. In the past I've studied topics ofstructural inequality in the economy, work relations, Western and non-Western contrasts, intersectingsystems of oppression, politics, and theories of social change. I am originally from Boston, Massachusettsand moved to San Diego in the summer of 2020 during the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic (talk abouttiming).I’ve held leadership positions that focused on student recruitment/retention, community building,academic success, student wellness and civic/community engagement. I have also played a pivotal role instudent activism and organizing my past circles. I like to listen to music and grab on to any opportunitythat allows me to laugh and smile. I enjoy being around my chosen family and intentionally surroundingmyself with company that serves me and my spirit. I imagine a world where all Black queer and transfolks are able to live in bliss and be carefree without the weight of the struggles that may come our way. Isee a future where we are able to be at a place where our minds, bodies and spirits are not only at ease butliberated.Nature of the StudyI will be inviting a group of students attending either the University of San Diego or San Diego StateUniversity who identify as Black and within the LGBTQIA2S+ spectrum to a what I will call “BlackQueer Trans Circls” or BQT Circle for short. In these spaces I hope for us to dialogue, laugh, dream andbuild with one another as we start to think about what it means to thrive as a Black queer and or transstudent in this world. I intend for this group to be small and have no more than 10 participants. This willbe composed of 5 minutes of completing a pre-survey, 60 minutes of community building, 60 minutes forthe focus groups. The total time commitment will be no more than 125 minutes. Food will be providedand you will be compensated with a $15 gift card for your time if selected to participate. You will receiveBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 44this compensation even if you decide not to complete the entire focus group. This will physically takeplace on the University of San Diego campus.Statement of TransparencyIn full transparency, I am fully aware of the realities of convening an event focused on Thrivingfor the Black Queer community on this campus predominantly white, private and Catholic). As aBlack queer person myself, I acknowledge any hesitation to engaging in this process given theexternal environment. However, I see this as an opportunity for our community to come togetherto reverse the idea that we are not meant to experience Thriving. Rather, our collective work willmake room for us to reclaim and co-design a definition of Thriving. This definition will be basedupon our community’s  resilience, power and joy as we envision a future of us being free.Logistics & Next StepsThe deadline to sign up and participate in the study is February 15, 2022.

I am currentlyworking on my capstone Action Research project in partial fulfillment of my degree requirement.As I was reviewing the literature, I learned about your Interview Guide instrument in AppendixD of your dissertation titled “To Simply Be: Thriving as a Black Queer/Same-Gender-LovingAdult.” This instrument is aligned with my research and I would like to request your permissionto use it for my study.My research titled “Blaqueer and Here: Black Queer and Trans Students’ Path to Thriving”examines the ways in which Black queer and trans students have (or have not) fosteredcommunity, lived authentically, and benefitted from support of their identity development. I willseek to explore support (or lack thereof) and identity development that exists within the realm ofpredominantly White higher educational institutions. I am excited about this deeply personalwork given my experience as a Black queer individual myself and my passion for highereducation.I am requesting your permission to incorporate partial use of Appendix D: Interview Guides formy methodology process. If you will allow me to use your instrument, I will cite your work andname according to APA 7 standards and, if you would like, share my findings with you.Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.Respectfully,BLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 54Marvens PierreMA Higher Education Leadership CandidateSchool of Leadership and Education Sciences619-260-4600 x. 4173mpierre@sandiego.eduBLACK QUEER AND TRANS STUDENTS’ PATH TO THRIVING 55APPENDIX H: INFORMAL PERMISSION NOTICEThis is a note to indicate that informal verbal permission was given by the author of the originalinstrument that was used to design the instrument for this study on June 17, 2021 via Zoombetween 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM PT.

    "abstract": "In this study, I have investigated the ways in which Black queer and trans students have (or have not) fostered community, lived authentically, and benefitted from support of their identity development. I explored what support (or lack thereof) and identity development that exists within the realm of predominantly White higher educational institutions as well as San Diego community resources at large. This study approach consisted of conducting strategic outreach to universities in San Diego, California, and building community circles to facilitate processes of qualitative narrative analysis. This led to an intentional focus group dialogue space that allowed the participants to put their wishes for Black queer thriving into voice and practice. This study will provide a framework for future coalition building for Black queer and trans populations in the San Diego area. This grants the opportunity to pioneer innovative and strategic collaborative methods to move Black queer and trans students from a state of surviving to thriving",
