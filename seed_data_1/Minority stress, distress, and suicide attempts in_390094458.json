Minority stress theory predicts that healthof sexual minorities is predicated on the social environment. As the social environmentimproves, exposure to stress would decline and health outcomes would improve. Weassessed how stress, identity, connectedness with the LGBT community, and psychologicaldistress and suicide behavior varied across three distinct cohorts of sexual minority peoplein the United States. Using a national probability sample recruited in 2016 and 2017, weassessed three a priori defined cohorts of sexual minorities we labeled the pride (born1956–1963), visibility (born 1974–1981), and equality (born 1990–1997) cohorts. We foundsignificant and impressive cohort differences in coming out milestones, with members of theyounger cohort coming out much earlier than members of the two older cohorts. But wefound no signs that the improved social environment attenuated their exposure to minoritystressors—both distal stressors, such as violence and discrimination, and proximal stress-ors, such as internalized homophobia and expectations of rejection. Psychological distressand suicide behavior also were not improved, and indeed were worse for the younger thanthe older cohorts. These findings suggest that changes in the social environment had limitedimpact on stress processes and mental health for sexual minority people. They speak to theendurance of cultural ideologies such as homophobia and heterosexism and accompanyingrejection of and violence toward sexual minorities.IntroductionFor decades, researchers have demonstrated that sexual minority people experience disparitiesin multiple indicators of mental health and physical health when compared to nonsexualminority populations [1]. Minority stress theory has been a primary causal model explainingthese health disparities.

TheGenerations investigators are: Ilan H. Meyer, PhDstigma and prejudice, social structures and health, and stress [2]. It describes how stressorsthat stem from prejudice and stigma, along with resilience resources (e.g., social support, com-munity connectedness), affect the health of sexual and gender minority people [2–6].Minority stress theory starts with the observation that stressors are not distributed ran-domly in society but are tied to social positions and social processes [7,8]. The basic premise ofthe theory is that all other things being equal (e.g., race and ethnicity, social class, gender), prej-udice toward sexual minorities predisposes them to excess stress as compared with their het-erosexual counterparts. In turn, this excess stress increases the risk of negative outcomescaused by stress and contributes to health disparities [2,9].By its basic premise, minority stress is understood in social context: It is a social theory ofstress and health. Therefore, we would expect that as social context shifts, so would experiencesof minority stress and resultant health outcomes. Thus, if prejudice toward sexual minoritypeople declined, minority stress and in turn, health disparities would decline. Indeed, duringthe past 50 years, there have been marked changes in the social environment of sexual minori-ties in the United States (and other societies). Younger cohorts of sexual minority people havebeen living in a world that in many ways was not imaginable to older cohorts of sexual minor-ity people when they were young [10,11]. In this study, we tested the proposition that in thecontext of increasing societal acceptance and cultural inclusion of sexual minority people,younger cohorts of sexual minorities fare better than older cohorts in terms of exposure tostress and health.Shifting social environment for sexual minority peopleOne of the most consistently used measures related to attitudes toward sexual minorities is aquestion in the General Social Survey that has been asked since the 1970s. Data have shownthat between 1973 and 2010, the proportion of Americans who said that homosexuality is“always wrong” declined from 70% to 43% [12]; by 2014, that proportion declined to 40% [13].Attitudes toward same-sex marriage also show similar trends. In 1996, 27% of Americans saidthey thought “same-sex couples should be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rightsas traditional marriages”. By 2015, the year the U.S. Supreme Court recognized same-sex mar-riage as constitutionally mandated, the proportion of Americans saying that marriage forsame-sex couples should be valid had grown to 60% [14]. By 2018, public support for marriagefor same-sex couples had grown to 67%, defying expectations that the court’s decision wouldlead to a backlash against same-sex marriages [14].Other shifts in the social environment are even more pronounced. During the past 50 years,homosexuality was reconceptualized from a mental illness, as defined by the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-I and II) in 1952 and 1968, to a normal variationof human sexual behavior, as it has been understood since the declassification of homosexual-ity as a mental disorder in 1973 [15–17].In law, in 2003, the Supreme Court declared sodomy laws unconstitutional in Lawrence v.Texas, reversing a decision to affirm the constitutionality of sodomy laws just 17 years earlier(Bowers v. Hardwick, 1986). Today, more than 58% of the sexual minority population in theUnited States live in areas that are defined as fair or better because of the existence of state lawsthat protect sexual minority people, such as nondiscrimination statutes protecting sexualminority people from unfair treatment in employment and housing and the absence of lawsthat marginalize sexual minority people, such as laws that restrict child welfare or medical ser-vices to sexual minority people based on the provider’s religious objection [18].Together, these changes have led to markedly different social environments for sexualminority people who came of age in the past 50 years.

Sexual minority people whocame of age in the 2000s can plan on getting married and having children. Younger cohorts ofsexual minority people can imagine themselves as accepted by family and community. In highschool, they may have had an opportunity to join with other sexual minority youth and alliesin school activities (e.g., gender and sexuality alliances) [20]. With the availability of the inter-net, they can find resources online, no matter how far they are from a major urban center,where most LGBT resources concentrated in the past, if they were available at all. In nationalmedia (films, TV shows, newspaper and magazine articles), a sexual minority person whocame of age after 2000 can see positive role models and a positive portrayal of life for sexualminorities.Of course, this is an optimistic, perhaps idyllic, portrayal of the lives of young sexual minor-ity people in the United States. In the context of rapid social change, the experiences of sexualminority people vary significantly based on their social or geopolitical setting. Although theMovement Advancement Project identified 58% of the sexual minority population as residingin a fair to positive policy environment, 42% of sexual minority people live in states defined ashaving a poor social environment by these measures, and 29 states still do not prohibit dis-crimination based on sexual orientation [21]. Recent studies showed that in the years beforefederal marriage equality (2015), state ballot initiatives to limit marriage were linked to thehealth and well-being of sexual minority adults [22–25] and homophobic bullying for school-aged students [26].Regardless of the political climate, for many sexual minority youth, acceptance at home, inschool, and in religious communities is still unattainable [27]. Additionally, studies haveshown that even after equal marriage was passed, minority stressors still persist for same-sexcouples, particularly in the familial domain [28–30].Has minority stress changed in the past few decades?The life course of sexual minority people is characterized by some transitions that are distinct,such as awareness of sexual minority identity (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer) and comingout, as well as normative life transitions, such as establishing healthy adult relationships, com-pleting education, and beginning employment [31,32]. Because of the vast changes in the sta-tus of sexual minority people in our society during the past 50 years, each recent cohort ofsexual minority people has faced a different environment in terms of legal status, communityattitudes, health context, and parental and familial acceptance [33,34].These contextual factors likely create divergent experiences for sexual minorities, but weknow little about their impact on minority stress and health. We do not know how minoritystress has been experienced by different cohorts of sexual minority people, but it is reasonableto expect that exposure to minority stress would have declined among younger sexual minoritypeople [35,36]. Thus, we would expect that today, sexual minority people are less likely to befired from a job because of their sexual orientation than they were in the 1970s, not onlybecause it is illegal in many regions—in June 2020, the Supreme Court declared employmentdiscrimination of sexual and gender minorities unconstitutional across the United States—butalso because of greater social acceptance of sexual minority people. Similarly, sexual minoritypeople in older cohorts often experienced rejection from family members, which has possiblydeclined for younger sexual minority people today.By extension, internalizing, or proximal, minority stressors, such as internalized homopho-bia—a minority stressor that is a significant predictor of adverse health and well-being [37]—PLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 3 / 19should be lower for younger sexual minority people if they experience more affirming and lessrejecting attitudes then their older peers had experienced as youth. The same is true for expec-tations of rejection and discrimination and for concealing one’s sexual minority identity [2].Despite being a stressor in its own right, concealing one’s sexual minority identity is oftenused as a protective mechanism, in an attempt to avoid rejection and violence. As the socialenvironment improved, people might be less fearful of rejection and violence and therefore,have less of a need to conceal their sexual minority identity. Therefore, we asked: Haveimproved social attitudes and legal conditions led to significant differences in the experienceof minority stress among members of cohorts of sexual minority people?Distinct cohorts of sexual minority people related to changes in the socialenvironmentTo address this question and test the impact of the changing social environment on the lives ofsexual minority people, we conceptualized three distinct cohorts of sexual minority people thatcorrespond to significant social changes in the U.S. regarding law, policy, and culture.One way to think about the social environment of sexual minority cohorts is to considerthe discourse about sexual minorities at the time the cohort members were young teens. Whatwould have been the main themes people learned about had they, at that young age, connectedwith the sexual minority discourse? Using this heuristic, we defined the age of 10 years old—considered a significant age for sexual development [38]—plus or minus 3 years, as a signifi-cant developmental period with which to define our cohort. We then identified significant his-torical events that characterized the social environment of sexual minority people since 1969(the full list is available on the study website at www.generations-study.com) and lined themup historically against the lifeline of people beginning at age 10.We identify three events as anchors that characterized three periods in the lives of sexualminorities: the Stonewall uprising (1969), the formation of ACT UP (1987), and the Massachu-setts Supreme Court ruling that it was unconstitutional to deny marriage to same sex couples(2003). Around these events, we defined three distinct cohorts. Table 1 provides a sample ofhistorical events that characterize each cohort.We named each cohort to capture that cohort’s essential characteristics. We described thefirst, older cohort (of people born 1956–1963), as the pride cohort. These individuals came ofage at a time when homosexuality was considered a mental disorder and sodomy was illegal inmany states. But sexual minority people in this era began early efforts to cultivate pride in theircommunities. It was an era when sexual minority (a “gay” identity) was born as a modern civilrights movement, with slogans such as “gay is good” and the first gay pride march [39].We named the second cohort the visibility cohort (born 1974–1981). The main discoursewhen they were experiencing puberty was around the AIDS epidemic that particularly affectedmen who have sex with men but had a profound impact on the entire LGBT community [40].Increasing visibility of sexual minorities portrayed them both as good, as caretakers of theirown and activists, but also as bad—as victims of a disease they deserved. When gay and bisex-ual men of this cohort became sexually active in the 1990s and 2000s, HIV/AIDS had alreadybecome an epidemic. This cohort of men benefited from better HIV prevention education andimproved AIDS antiretroviral therapies. These therapies changed HIV from the death sentenceit had been just a cohort before to a dreaded, but manageable, disease [40]. One of the hall-marks of this period was a significant strengthening of LGBT institutions including politicalactivist organizations, community health centers, and other community development [41].Among many milestones, this period saw the establishment of an LGBT high school in NewPLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 4 / 19Table 1.

The discourse duringthe period of their teenage years had shifted to a discourse about the equality of sexual minori-ties and demands (and some successes) regarding their cultural inclusion. The discoursearound equality was most resonant (and successful) around marriage equality. Members ofthis cohort witnessed reversal of the federal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that prohibited sex-ual minority military personnel to be open about their sexual identities and the invalidation ofsignificant parts of the Defense of Marriage Act by the Supreme Court. Also, significantly, pub-lic attitudes in the United States changed to reflect more positive views of homosexuality[42,43]. Thus, sexual minority people in the equality cohort grew up in a less prejudicial societyas compared with the older cohorts.Using a probability sample of sexual minorities in the United States, we asked: How dothese three cohorts differ in levels of minority stress experiences, their association with LGBTcommunity, and mental health outcomes like distress and suicidality? Answering these ques-tions is significant to understanding the causes of health disparities, developing public healthand policy interventions, and improving clinical interventions with sexual minority peopleacross the life course.Materials and methodsSampleData were collected as part of the Generations study, a 5-year study designed to examine healthand well-being across three cohorts of sexual minority people. The Generations study used atwo-phase recruitment procedure. In the first phase, utilizing a question asked of all Galluprespondents in the Daily Tracking Survey (see Measures), all LGBT individuals were identi-fied. In the second phase, respondents who identified as LGBT were assessed for eligibility forparticipation in the Generations study, and those eligible were invited to participate in the sur-vey [44].The first phase was conducted by Gallup using a national probability sample of adults aged18 or older. Gallup used a dual-frame sampling procedure, which included random-digit dial-ing to reach both landline and cellphone users. Gallup stratified the dialing list to ensure thatthe unweighted samples were proportionate by U.S. census region and time zone. Gallupweighted the data daily to compensate for disproportionalities in nonresponse and selectionprobabilities.The second phase consisted of a self-administered survey. Respondents were eligible if theyidentified as cisgender or a gender nonbinary sexual minority; belonged to the three cohortsunder investigation (aged 18–25, 34–41, or 52–59); were Black, Latino, or White; completedsixth grade at least; and spoke English well enough to conduct the phone interview in English.(Respondents who identified as transgender, regardless of their sexual orientation, werescreened for participation in a related TransPop study).Eligibility was limited to these age groups because the scientific focus concerned differencesamong age cohorts related to the social environment, as previously described. Eligibility waslimited to the three larger racial and ethnic groups in the United States, as well as bi- or multi-racial groups that included one of these, because estimates of recruitment showed that wewould not be able to get a sufficient number of respondents who belonged to smaller racialand ethnic groups (i.e., Asian and Native American or Alaska Native). Eligibility was restrictedto sixth grade or higher education to ensure reading comprehension for self-administration ofthe survey.PLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 6 / 19Eligible respondents who agreed to receive the Generations survey received a survey ques-tionnaire by email or mail to complete by self-administration (via a web link or printed ques-tionnaire, respectively). Respondents received a $25 gift certificate together with their surveymaterials. Prior to completing the survey, respondents reviewed the consent information.Respondents who received the survey electronically via email submitted the web survey online;respondents with mailed surveys returned the questionnaires using a provided preaddressed,prestamped envelope.Recruitment lasted a year, between March 28, 2016, and March 30, 2017, with recruitmentof 366,644 participants screened by Gallup. Of them, 3.5% identified as LGBT, and 3,525 meteligibility criteria. Of those eligible, 81% agreed to participate in the survey and of those, 48%completed the survey, for an overall cooperation rate of 39%. To increase the number of racialand ethnic minority respondents, we oversampled Black and Latino respondents using thesame procedures by extending the recruitment period (April 1, 2017, to March 30, 2018). Thefinal Generations baseline sample size was 1,518, including 1,331 from the original sample and187 from the enhancement sample.The study was approved by the IRBs of UCLA and Gallup. The UCLA IRB served as thelead IRB for collaborating universities. Respondents were anonymous to the investigators,information about respondents’ identity was held by Gallup, which administered the survey.In lieu of signed consent, respondents received an information sheet that they had to acceptprior to participating in the survey.MeasuresSexual identity. In Phase 1, Gallup asked all respondents: “Do you, personally, identifyas lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender?” with response options “yes, do” or “no, do not”.Because this question includes both LGB and transgender people, we followed up with peo-ple who said “yes”. To assess sexual minority status, respondents were asked, “Which of thefollowing best describes your current sexual orientation?” with the response options,“straight/heterosexual”, “lesbian”, “gay”, “bisexual”, “queer”, “same-gender loving”, or“other”; if they answered that they were not heterosexual, they were considered a sexualminority person.Gender identity. In Phase 2, respondents were also asked two questions to determinetheir gender identity: First, “On your original birth certificate, was your sex assigned as femaleor male?” with the response options of “female” or “male”, and then, “Do you currentlydescribe yourself as a man, woman, or transgender?” with the response options of “man”,“woman”, and “transgender”. Respondents who said they were transgender were then asked,“Are you trans woman (male-to-female), trans man (female-to-male), or nonbinary or gender-queer”. Respondents were classified as transgender if they said they were transgender in thesecond question or if their current gender identity (second question) was different than theirsex assigned at birth (first question).Coming out milestones. Respondents reported the age when they were first sexuallyattracted to a same-sex person, age of first sexual relationship, age of first intimate same-sexrelationship, age when they first realized they were LGB, and age when they first told a familymember that they were LGB.Minority stressors. Sexual orientation change effort. Also referred to as conversion ther-apy, this measure was developed by the Generations investigators. Respondents were asked,“Did you ever receive treatment from someone who tried to change your sexual orientation(such as try to make you straight/heterosexual)”. Responses coded as having ever receivedsuch treatment or not.PLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 7 / 19Victimization. These experiences were assessed using six items that asked whether therespondents experienced during their lifetime being physical and sexual assaulted, threatenedwith assault, and verbally abused [45]. Responses were dichotomized into “once or more” ver-sus “never”.Everyday discrimination. This 9-item scale assesses common experiences of microaggres-sion, including being disrespected, treated unfairly, and harassed over a year prior to the inter-view [46]. Responses were recorded on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from “often” to “never”.The scale score was created as a mean score of each item within the scale. The resulting vari-able was reverse-coded so that lower values represented less everyday discrimination andhigher values represented more everyday discrimination. Scale values ranged from 1 to 4(Cronbach’s alpha = .91).Felt stigma. This 3-item scale developed by Herek [45] asks about respondents’ expectationsthat they will be stigmatized by others in their community, asking whether “most people”where the respondent lives would think less of or be less likely to hire someone who is openlyLGB. Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to“strongly agree”, with a middle category of “neither agree nor disagree”. Lower values repre-sented less felt stigma and higher values represented greater felt stigma. Scale values rangedfrom 1 to 5 (Cronbach’s alpha = .70).Internalized homophobia (revised). This 5-item scale assesses the respondent’s feelingsabout being a sexual minority, including whether the respondent tried to stop being attractedto people of the same sex, felt that being sexual minority is a shortcoming, or sought profes-sional help to change their sexual orientation to become straight [47]. Responses wererecorded on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. Thescale score was created as a mean score of each items in the scale. Lower values representedless internalized homophobia and higher values represented greater internalized homophobia.Scale values ranged from 1 to 5 (Cronbach’s alpha = .75).Mental health indicators. Psychological distress. This 6-item scale asks how often, in thepast 30 days, respondents felt “nervous”, “hopeless”, “restless or fidgety”, “so depressed thatnothing could cheer you up”, “that everything was an effort”, and “worthless” [48]. Responseswere recorded on a 5-point scale ranging from “all of the time” to “none of the time” (Cron-bach’s alpha = .89).Suicide attempt. This was assessed with the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience inService Members instrument [49]. Respondents answered “yes” or “no” to a series of questionsincluding, “Did you ever make a suicide attempt (i.e., purposefully hurt yourself with at leastsome intention to die)?”Identity and LGBT community affiliation. Connection with the LGBT community. This7-item scale, adapted from the 8-item scale described by Frost and Meyer [50], assesses thedesire for and strength of LGBT community affiliation among respondents. Scale itemsinclude “You feel you’re a part of the LGBT community” and “You are proud of the LGBTcommunity”. Responses were recorded on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from “agree strongly”to “disagree strongly”. The scale variable was created as a mean score of each item in the scale.The final scale was reverse-coded so that lower scores represented lower community connect-edness, whereas higher scores represented greater community connectedness. Scale values ran-ged from 1 to 4 (Cronbach’s alpha = .86).Sexual identity centrality. This 5-item subscale from Mohr and Kendra’s [51] 27-item Les-bian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale assesses the degree to which respondents’ sexual identi-ties were central to their overall identities. Scale items include “My sexual orientation is aninsignificant part of who I am” and “Being an LGB person is a very important aspect of mylife”. Responses were recorded on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from “disagree strongly” toPLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 8 / 19“agree strongly”. The scale score was created as a mean score of each item in the scale. Lowervalues represented lower centrality and higher values represented greater centrality. Scale val-ues range from 1 to 6 (Cronbach’s alpha = .81).Statistical analysesWe used descriptive statistics to describe demographic characteristics of the sample (Table 2).We calculated point estimates and 95% confidence intervals to assess differences among thecohorts in lieu of significance testing because we did not pose specific hypotheses regardingthe demographics of the cohorts. In Table 3, we reported differences among the cohorts ineight categorical and six continuous outcome measures. For the eight categorical variables, wepresent point prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals weighted for the sampledpopulation. We assessed differences among the cohorts using odds ratios (OR) and 95%Table 2.

But there were significant age differences for every other milestone, with the youngercohort of LGB people having earlier onset of a sexual relationship, realizing they were LGB,and telling a family member they were LGB (F = 21.77, p< .001; F = 45.83, p< .001;F = 195.35, p< .001, respectively).Minority stressorsIn Table 3, we show differences and similarities among cohorts in exposure to minority stress-ors, community affiliation, and mental health indicators. There were small, nonsignificant dif-ferences in the proportions of people who had been subjected to sexual orientation changeeffort in their lifetime across cohorts, with about 6% to 8% of all sexual minority peopleexperiencing sexual orientation change effort and ORs indicating statistical nonsignificance,hovering around 1.In terms of lifetime experiences of victimization (since age 18), we found that more sexualminorities in the older or middle cohorts than in the younger cohort reported having been hit,beaten, physically attacked, or sexually assaulted (F = 8.27, p< .001), with statistically signifi-cant differences between the younger and middle cohorts but not the younger and oldercohorts or the middle and older cohorts. Results were significant for having been robbed orhaving had property stolen, vandalized, or purposely damaged, with all cohorts significantlydifferent from one another, showing that the younger cohort had less exposure than the mid-dle and older cohorts and the middle cohort had less exposure than the older cohort. The restof the victimization items in Table 3—attempted robbery, having been threatened with vio-lence, having been verbally insulted or abused, and having had an object thrown at—all hadsimilar patterns, with statistically significant differences between the younger and middle andyounger and older cohorts, showing that the younger cohort had less exposure than the middleand older cohorts; however, the differences between the middle and older cohorts were notstatistically significant. (The difference between the younger and older cohorts for having beenverbally insulted or abused was in the same direction but marginal in significance).Sexual minority people in the younger cohort had experienced more everyday discrimina-tion than sexual minority people in the middle and older cohorts, with the middle cohort hav-ing intermediate levels of everyday discrimination. In terms of internalized homophobia, theyounger cohort did not differ from the middle cohort, but both the younger and middleFig 1. Ages at milestones related to LGB attraction, behavior, identity, and disclosure by age cohort, (N = 1,518).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827.g001PLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 11 / 19cohorts had higher levels of internalized homophobia than the older cohort. The three cohortsdid not differ in level of felt stigma (i.e., expectations of rejection and discrimination).Identity centrality and affiliation with the LGBT communityWe assessed similarities and differences among the three cohorts in centrality of minority sex-ual identity and connection with LGBT community. On both measures, the mean scores weresimilar across the cohorts, but young cohort members reported the highest levels on bothscales. The difference was significant for connection with the LGBT community between theyounger and middle cohorts and the younger and older cohorts, but not between the middleand older cohorts. The difference in identity centrality of sexual orientation identity was signif-icant only between the middle and older cohorts, with the older cohort having a slightly highermean score on the scale (Table 2).Psychological distress and suicideWhen it comes to psychological distress, members of the younger cohort reported higher levelsof distress than both the middle and older cohorts, and the middle cohort reported a higherlevel of distress than the older cohort.Regarding lifetime suicide attempts, 30% of the younger cohort, 24% of the middle cohort,and 21% of the older cohort reported at least one suicide attempt (only the difference betweenthe younger and older cohorts was statistically significant).DiscussionWe started this project with the hypothesis that younger cohorts of sexual minority peoplewould fare better than their older peers, who grew up in a more hostile social and legal envi-ronment than that of the younger cohorts. We found a strong cohort impact on the age ofsame-sex attraction milestones: Each successive cohort had earlier sexual identity milestoneexperiences of identifying as a sexual minority person, first sexual experience, and coming out.This likely indicates both greater comfort in coming out and shifting social norms around sex-uality and youth. On one hand, these trends suggest that the younger cohorts reached develop-mental milestones related to their sexuality earlier than older cohorts, which is generallyunderstood to be positive for adjustment. On the other hand, identifying and coming out as asexual minority can confer risk, including greater exposure to minority stressors and victimi-zation [52].Indeed, contrary to our hypothesis, we found little evidence that social and legal improve-ments during the past 50 years in the status of sexual minority people have altered the experi-ences of sexual minority people in terms of exposure to minority stressors and resultantadverse mental health outcomes. Most tellingly, younger sexual minority people did not haveless psychological distress or fewer suicide attempts than older sexual minority people.Regarding minority stress, we found that members of the younger cohort did not experi-ence less minority stress than members of older cohorts. This was consistent across both distalminority stressors, which measure direct exposure to external conditions, such as antigay vio-lence, and proximal stressors, which measure how homophobia is internalized and learned.Members of the younger cohort did experience fewer of the victimization experiences we stud-ied. But the measure of lifetime exposure to victimization presents a challenge. By their nature,lifetime measures would show higher prevalence among older people simply because theyhave more years in their lifetime and therefore, more opportunities for experiencing victimiza-tion. It this context, it is notable that the younger sexual minority people experienced moreextreme victimization in their shorter lifespan. More than 1 in 3 (37%) experienced being hit,PLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 12 / 19beaten, physically attacked, or sexually assaulted; almost half (46%) had someone threatenthem with violence; and almost 3 in 4 (72%) were verbally insulted or abused. In terms of prox-imal minority stressors—internalized homophobia and felt stigma—we found members of theyounger cohort recorded as high or higher levels of stress relative to their older counterparts.Consistent with findings on the experience of minority stressors, we found high scores ofpsychological distress in the younger cohort. Although some research has suggested that thismay be a general trend for younger adults to have higher levels of depressive symptoms, thereappears to be a U-shaped relationship in the general population, with younger and older peo-ple exhibiting high levels of depressive symptoms measured by the same scale we used [53].We found a clear disadvantage to the younger cohort that seems unique to sexual minoritypeople. Research has also shown that no significant bias in reporting patterns to this scalecould explain the pattern of our results [54]. We also found that 30% of members of the youn-ger cohort had attempted suicide. This is an alarming figure that was even higher than the highproportions of lifetime suicide attempts reported by the middle and older cohorts. By compari-son, the proportion of young people aged 18–24 in the general population who have attemptedsuicide has been less than 4% [55].Our findings are clearly inconsistent with the hypothesis. We started our hypothesis from atheoretical perspective that suggests that as social conditions improve, exposure to minoritystressors and mental health problems would decrease. Our hypothesis was optimistic, but wewere not blind to evidence to the contrary. As Russell and Fish [56] have shown, disparities bysexual identity have not been declining, but instead increasing. Most foretelling has been find-ings by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about exposure to stress among youthin high schools. Reports have consistently indicated that sexual minority youth experience sig-nificantly more stressful experiences than heterosexual youth and suffer significantly greateradverse health outcomes, including suicide ideation and attempts [57–60]. Our findings, thus,are consistent with studies that showed that minority stress and health disparities based on sex-ual orientation have not dissipated [56,61–64], despite the significant social and legal gains ofthe last decades.Finally, contradicting writings about the declining significance of the LGBT communityand sexual minority identity for the young cohort of sexual minority people, we found as higha sense of centrality of sexual minority identity and sense of connection with the LGBT com-munity [35,36]. This is an important finding because it suggests that the LGBT community isstill an important locale for connecting with LGBT identities, values that denounce homopho-bia, and role models for healthy sexual minority lives. As has been shown with older cohorts ofsexual minorities, these are important resilience factors that allow sexual minority people togrow and overcome homophobia [2,65–69]. Connection with the LGBT community is alsoimportant for health information and the public health of LGBT communities, becauseresources serving sexual minorities have been organized under the LGBT banner for decades[70]. Studies have shown, for example, that gay and bisexual men who were connected toLGBT health resources were more likely than those who were not to use preexposure prophy-laxis as HIV prevention [40]. However, this should not obscure the many challenges facingLGBT community organizers to overcome intracommunity rejection across race, social class,and other attributes [71].There are many reasons why our hypothesis was not supported, and it is beyond our scopeto explore these. Our approach was to examine cohort-wide patterns of change. In that, wemay have missed the impact on specific segments of the populations. For example, we do notknow whether White sexual minority people fared differently than ethnic minorities or howgender impacted the patterns we studied. This was, of course, purposeful because our theorywas that the entire cohort would be affected by historical changes (even if not in equal ways).PLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 13 / 19Also, it is plausible that social conditions, looked at as broadly as we did, do not reveal manyother influences on stress exposure and mental health outcomes. For example, even if thesocial environment improved overall, it may have not improved in all microenvironments.Furthermore, it is possible that even as the social environment improves, the lived experienceof sexual minority people continues to be challenging [72]. For example, a gay or lesbian teen-ager may be more accepted now than their older cohort peers had been when they were teen-agers, but they were still a minority in their high school, deprived of opportunities fordeveloping intimate relations. Also, a “developmental collision” may occur as sexual minorityidentity disclosure at younger ages coincides with normative developmental processes associ-ated with adolescence [56]. Although the larger social context may have improved in such away that emboldens younger generations to be out, the normative developmental context ofadolescence remains one in which conformity is prized. Compulsions to conform to genderand sexual norms that privilege heterosexuality may continue to characterize adolescence inthe United States [73]. Future analysis could determine whether some segments of the popula-tion benefited more than others from the improved social conditions and how improved socialconditions impact the lived experience of sexual minority people.Study limitationsOur study was limited in several important ways that are relevant to drawing conclusionsabout cohort differences. First, our purpose was to provide an overview of the status of stressand health in three cohorts of sexual minority people at one point using cross-sectional data.Obviously, this one-time picture limits our ability to discuss historical differences and trajecto-ries, but we interpret the results to suggest that they reflect the impact of historical changes inthe status of sexual minority people in society. Our interpretation is based on theory and our apriori categorization of the three cohorts. Because we aimed to capture the impact of historicalcontext, we erred by ignoring potential differences among members of any age cohort thatcould have affected variability in cohorts. We assessed differences among three cohorts of sex-ual minority people but not differences by gender, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status,neighborhood context, etc. This is consistent with our hypothesis about cohort differences.Regardless of variability in each cohort, we tested the hypothesis that the younger cohort, as awhole, fared better than older cohorts because members of the young cohort, across all strata,enjoyed better social conditions than members of older cohorts.Second, like all measures, our measures of stress, coping, and health were limited in thateach measure has its limitations and represents only a portion of complex constructs. Forexample, we assessed depressive symptoms and suicide attempts as proxies for the construct ofmental health. Nonetheless, we present a variety of stress measures that include victimizationand everyday discrimination, internalized minority stressors (felt stigma and internalizedhomophobia), and generalized distress, which is associated with mental health and suicideattempts—a clear and serious outcome and significant gauge of sexual minority health. Thetwo measures that represent resilience assessed connection with the community and centralityof identity—two important elements of coping with minority stress.Third, cohort (and the historical periods of interest) and age were confounded. That is,there was no way to avoid the fact that respondents who came of age in more distant historicalperiods are also older than respondents who grew up in the context of recent and improvedsocial conditions. Therefore, it is plausible that some differences that we observed resultedfrom developmental or age-related changes rather than the impact of the different historicalsocial environments. For example, internalized homophobia typically is expected to declinewith age, as a person comes to terms with their same-sex attraction and comes out [32]. OurPLOS ONE Minority stress in 3 cohorts of sexual minority adultsPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246827 March 3, 2021 14 / 19finding that internalized homophobia was higher in the younger than older cohort is consis-tent with that theory and could reflect the younger developmental stage of the younger cohortmembers. On the other hand, if social conditions have improved so greatly, we could haveexpected that internalized homophobia—which denotes rejection of oneself because of one’ssame-sex attraction and identity—would cease to be an issue for younger people altogether.That is definitely not the case. Our findings show that some younger people still struggle withself-acceptance. So, although we cannot say with certainty that there is no age effect, we cer-tainly can say that internalized homophobia has not ended in young sexual minority people.ConclusionOur study has many strengths. It is the first probability sample to provide nationally represen-tative statistics on the specific experiences of sexual minority people using measures that weretailored to this population (as compared with general population surveys that did not includesexual minority-specific measures). It is the also the first large-scale study with a design thatallows for inferences about the relationships between key health outcomes and social contextamong sexual minority populations.Few social issues have shifted as dramatically during a half-century as cultural attitudes andsocial policies affecting sexual minorities. In the span of 50 years since the Stonewall uprising,homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness and eventually decriminalized. The commu-nity endured a large-scale public health epidemic and successfully advocated for rights and rec-ognition, including the right to marry and most recently, protection against employmentdiscrimination. Given the marked changes in the social and political contexts in the UnitedStates and elsewhere, it is difficult to imagine a uniform experience of development for sexualminorities. Rather, we would expect to find variability across cohorts in critical aspects ofdevelopment. The evidence of changes in identity development processes, including opportu-nities for self-labeling and the timing of milestones, is clear [73–77]. But analysis of stress expo-sure and mental health suggests little distinction in the experience of minority stress acrosscohorts, indicating no discernable improvement in minority stress and health of sexualminorities.These findings indicate the extent to which changes in the social environment have beenlimited in their impact on stress processes and mental health for sexual minority people. Theyspeak to the endurance of cultural ideologies such as homophobia and heterosexism accompa-nying rejection of and violence toward sexual minorities. They call our attention to the contin-ued need to recognize threats to the health and well-being of sexual minority people across allages and remind us that LGBT equality remains elusive [78].Supporting informationS1 File.(PDF)AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Evan Krueger and Winston Luhur for data analyses and Eric Lindberg forcopy editing.Author ContributionsConceptualization: Ilan H.

    "abstract": "During the past 50 years, there have been marked improvement in the social and legal environment of sexual minorities in the United States. Minority stress theory predicts that health of sexual minorities is predicated on the social environment. As the social environment improves, exposure to stress would decline and health outcomes would improve. We assessed how stress, identity, connectedness with the LGBT community, and psychological distress and suicide behavior varied across three distinct cohorts of sexual minority people in the United States. Using a national probability sample recruited in 2016 and 2017, we assessed three a priori defined cohorts of sexual minorities we labeled the pride (born 1956-1963), visibility (born 1974-1981), and equality (born 1990-1997) cohorts. We found significant and impressive cohort differences in coming out milestones, with members of the younger cohort coming out much earlier than members of the two older cohorts. But we found no signs that the improved social environment attenuated their exposure to minority stressors-both distal stressors, such as violence and discrimination, and proximal stressors, such as internalized homophobia and expectations of rejection. Psychological distress and suicide behavior also were not improved, and indeed were worse for the younger than the older cohorts. These findings suggest that changes in the social environment had limited impact on stress processes and mental health for sexual minority people. They speak to the endurance of cultural ideologies such as homophobia and heterosexism and accompanying rejection of and violence toward sexual minorities",
