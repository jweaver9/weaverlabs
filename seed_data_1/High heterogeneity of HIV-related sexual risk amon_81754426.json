Studies have detected high\nprevalences of HIV-related risk behaviours, self-reported HIV, and HIV seropositivity.\nMethods: The Trans PULSE Project conducted a multi-mode survey using respondent-driven sampling to recruit\n433 trans people in Ontario, Canada. Weighted estimates were calculated for HIV-related risk behaviours, HIV testing\nand self-reported HIV, including subgroup estimates for gender spectrum and ethno-racial groups.\nResults: Trans people in Ontario report a wide range of sexual behaviours with a full range of partner types. High\nproportions – 25% of female-to-male (FTM) and 51% of MTF individuals – had not had a sex partner within the past\nyear. Of MTFs, 19% had a past-year high-risk sexual experience, versus 7% of FTMs. The largest behavioural\ncontributors to HIV risk were sexual behaviours some may assume trans people do not engage in: unprotected\nreceptive genital sex for FTMs and insertive genital sex for MTFs. Overall, 46% had never been tested for HIV;\nlifetime testing was highest in Aboriginal trans people and lowest among non-Aboriginal racialized people.\nApproximately 15% of both FTM and MTF participants had engaged in sex work or exchange sex and about 2%\ncurrently work in the sex trade. Self-report of HIV prevalence was 10 times the estimated baseline prevalence for\nOntario. However, given wide confidence intervals and the high proportion of trans people who had never been\ntested for HIV, estimating the actual prevalence was not possible.\nConclusions: Results suggest potentially higher than baseline levels of HIV; however low testing rates were\nobserved and self-reported prevalences likely underestimate seroprevalence. Explicit inclusion of trans people in\nepidemiological surveillance statistics would provide much-needed information on incidence and prevalence. Given\nthe wide range of sexual behaviours and partner types reported, HIV prevention programs and materials should not\nmake assumptions regarding types of behaviours trans people do or do not engage in.\nKeywords: HIV, Transgender, Transsexual, Sexual risk, Canada, Respondent-driven sampling, HIV testingBackground\nPrevious reports on the health of trans (transgender,\ntranssexual or transitioned; see Table 1 for definitions)\npeople suggest this community is disproportionately\naffected by HIV and other sexually transmitted infections\n[1-5].

While trans sex workers may\nhave elevated risk, it is not clear that this stems directly\nfrom commercial sex. Studies have demonstrated that\nsexual risk among trans sex workers may come primarily\nfrom main partners rather than commercial partners\n[8,9].\nCompared to MTFs, there are few studies estimating\nHIV prevalence among female-to-male spectrum (FTM)\ntrans people. Estimates range from 0% to 3% [3]. The only\nstudy to date to present test-based HIV seroprevalencereported that 2% of FTMs in a San Francisco sample were\nHIV positive, versus 35% of MTFs [1].\nIn the U.S., higher prevalences of HIV have been iden-\ntified for African-American MTFs, with seroprevalences\nas high as 63% [1]. Summary measures from a meta-\nanalysis estimate self-reported HIV positivity at 30.8%\nfor African-American MTFs, and seroprevalence at\n56.3% [3]. Considering historical and contemporary dif-\nferences between the U.S. and Canada with regard to\ncolonialism, slavery, immigration policies and patterns,\nand human rights policy, it is not clear to what extent\nethno-racial inequities observed in the U.S. may apply\nin Canada. However, given the impact of experiences of\nracism, HIV vulnerability among racialized groups of\ntrans people in Canada is a concern. Despite long-\nstanding recognition of HIV vulnerabilities among Abo-\nriginal Canadians, concerns regarding HIV among Abo-\nriginal trans people have only begun to be addressed.\nAboriginal people represented 3.8% of the Canadian\npopulation, 8% of all prevalent HIV infections, and\n12.5% of all new infections in 2008 [10].\nStudies have described behavioural sexual risk factors\nfor HIV among MTFs in particular. These factors include\ncompulsive sexual behaviour [11], sex work [11,12], mul-\ntiple sex partners [1], unprotected receptive anal sex\n[13], and sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol\n[13]. Having sex with cisgender men who have sex with\nmen [14], or having a partner of an unknown HIV status\n[15], were also documented risk factors for HIV.\nAs with prevalence estimates, for FTMs there is less\ninformation available about HIV-related sexual risk beha-\nviours, though research suggests that some FTMs engage\nin high-risk sex, in particular those who have sex with\ncisgender male partners. Several small- to moderate-size\nstudies report high proportions of FTMs engaging in\nhigh-risk sex, including unprotected receptive genital\nand anal sex [1,16-18]. Among 22 FTMs participating in\nan Ontario study of gay, bisexual and other men who\nhave sex with men (MSM), about one third reported un-\nprotected receptive anal sex in the past 6 months with a\npartner who was HIV-positive or of unknown status\n[19]; similar findings were recently reported among trans\nMSM in one U.S. region [20]. While most research on\ntrans sex workers focuses on MTFs, FTMs also engage,\nor have engaged in sex work. One of the earliest and lar-\ngest studies of FTMs, in San Francisco, found that 31%\nof FTM participants had a history of sex work or survival\nsex [1].\nThis emerging body of evidence on HIV risk among\ntrans people documents extraordinarily high rates of\nHIV within segments of trans communities, in particular\namong African-American MTFs, and MTF sex workers\ninternationally. To date, the majority of studies looking\nat HIV and HIV-related sexual risk behaviour have relied\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:292 Page 3 of 12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/292almost solely on convenience or venue-based samples\nfrom jurisdictions outside of Canada, and are largely\nbased on MTFs living in inner cities or large urban cen-\ntres, involved in sex work and/or accessing services\nwhere they are more likely to come into contact with\nresearchers. While HIV prevalence among trans people\nis commonly assumed to be high, very little is known\nabout HIV infection rates, testing rates, sexual risk beha-\nviours, and even the socio-demographic structure of\ntrans communities more broadly, including those outside\nof urban centres and not closely affiliated with organized\ntrans communities. This information is essential both to\nmore accurately identify those groups within trans com-\nmunities that are at highest risk for HIV, and to avoid\nextrapolating from very high-risk subgroups to all trans\npeople, some of whom will be at no risk. In addition,\nlittle is known about how socio-demographics and HIV-\nrelated factors may vary in a Canadian context, which\ndiffers significantly, for example, from that of the United\nStates. Socio-demographics are important, as proximal\nsexual risk determinants (e.g. specific sexual behaviours,\nsex partner numbers) can be better understood in the\ncontext of the social determinants of health. This paper\nseeks to describe socio-demographics, self-reported HIV\nprevalence and HIV-related sexual risk among trans\npeople in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province.\nMethods\nTrans PULSE Project\nThe Trans PULSE Project is a community-based re-\nsearch study of the health and HIV vulnerability of trans\npeople in Ontario. The project involves a long-standing\npartnership between community agencies, academic\nresearchers, and unaffiliated trans community members.\nA qualitative first phase was conducted, and the results\nwere used to inform the development of the survey, as\nwell as to develop and refine a theoretical model of how\nstructural and informational barriers to health care ac-\ncess are created for trans people [21]. Research Ethics\nBoard approvals were obtained from The University of\nWestern Ontario and Wilfrid Laurier University. Results\npresented herein represent findings from the quantitative\nsecond phase of the project.\nSampling\nTrans participants (n = 433) were recruited using re-\nspondent-driven sampling, a method of chain-referral\nsampling suited to reaching hidden populations [22,23].\nSeeds, or initial participants, were 16 trans people who\nwere diversely situated, both geographically and demo-\ngraphically, and who served as members of the project’s\nCommunity Engagement Team. Seeds each recruited a\nmaximum of 3 additional participants as the first wave;\nthese similarly recruited the second wave of participants,and so on. New potential recruits received a coupon\ncontaining eligibility criteria and information regarding\nthe study, the different modes they could choose for par-\nticipation, and how to initiate the process on our survey\nwebsite or via our toll-free telephone line. Upon contact,\nas well as through promotional materials, they were told\nthe survey should take between 60 and 90 minutes to\ncomplete, and that the purpose of the study was to\nunderstand the health of trans people in Ontario. Once 4\nto 5 waves of participants were recruited, the number of\nwaves typically needed to obtain equilibrium (a stable\nsample composition through successive waves), 22 add-\nitional seeds were added. Recruitment continued from\nMay, 2009 through April, 2010, reaching a total of 10\nwaves. While participants could remain anonymous, re-\ncruitment patterns were tracked using ticket numbers,\nand the degree (number of other eligible people known)\nwas assessed for each participant. To be eligible, partici-\npants had to 1) indicate they were trans; 2) live, work, or\nreceive health care in Ontario, and; 3) be age 16 or older.\nTrans was defined inclusively, and it was made explicit\nto potential participants that they were not required to\nhave begun a social gender transition or to have under-\ntaken interventions to medically transition sex. This\nbroad definition of trans was made clear on recruitment\ncoupons, the project website, the letter of information\nand consent, and the eligibility questions that partici-\npants had to respond to (online or via telephone) prior\nto participating. Participants received a $20 gift card\nhonorarium, or could donate it to a trans-related com-\nmunity group; about half of honoraria were accepted and\nhalf donated. Surveys could be completed online, via a\nvisually identical paper-and-pencil survey, or over the\ntelephone with language interpretation. In the final two\nmonths of the study, $5 secondary incentives were added\nfor recruiting peers, including retroactively for partici-\npants for whom we had contact information; these did\nnot appear to impact recruitment.\nMeasures\nMeasures included demographics, sexual behaviour his-\ntory and sexual risk measures, HIV testing history, and\nself-reported HIV status.\nDemographics\nSocio-demographic measures included gender spectrum,\nage, ethno-racial background, region of residence, coun-\ntry of birth, highest educational level attained, poverty,\nand social and medical transition status. Gender\nspectrum was classified as female-to-male versus male-\nto-female. Not all participants identified as male or\nfemale, and these were classified by direction of gender\ndivergence from birth sex. For example, an individual\nwho was assigned male at birth and identified as Two-\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:292 Page 4 of 12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/292Spirit was assigned to the male-to-female spectrum\ngroup. Ethno-racial background(s) were assessed with a\ncheck-all-that-apply question, and so totals will not sum\nto 100%. Multiple survey items were used to categorize\ninto the broader ethno-racial group variable for analysis.\nParticipants who did not check “Aboriginal”, but who\nindicated in another item that they were First Nations,\nMétis, or Inuit were coded as Aboriginal. Those indicat-\ning only white background(s) were coded as white, and\nafter data checking, the remaining individuals were\ncoded as non-Aboriginal racialized people. In this paper,\nthe term “racialized” is used when describing people of\ncolour. This is consistent with usage recommended by\nthe Ontario Human Rights Commission’s guidelines,\nwhich state that this term is “preferred over racial minor-\nity, visible minority, person of colour or non-White as it\nexpresses race as a social construct rather than a descrip-\ntion on perceived biological traits” [24].\nRegion of residence was coded based on the first letter\nof a participant’s postal code. Household poverty was\ncalculated using the Statistics Canada formula for low\nincome cut-off (LICO) applied to mid-points for house-\nhold income categories. For reference, the LICO for a\nhousehold of 1 (in Canadian dollars) was $21,189; for a\nhousehold of 4 it was $42,378.\nFor social transition status, participants were asked to\nindicate whether they were living in their core gender\nfull-time, part-time, or not at all. For medical transition\nstatus, they were asked their current situation regarding\nhormones and/or surgery, and indicated whether they\nhad medically transitioned, were in the process, were\nplanning to but had not begun, were not planning to,\nwere not sure, or that the concept of “transitioning” did\nnot apply to them. No particular medications or proce-\ndures were required to be classified as having medically\ntransitioned, other than the participant’s indication that\nthe process was completed for them.\nSexual behaviours\nParticipants self-reported information on lifetime and\npast-year sex partner numbers, and on past-year engage-\nment in different types of sexual behaviours, including\noral, anal and genital sex. For each, participants were\nasked if such activities had involved flesh genitals, sili-\ncone or latex, or fingers or hands, and how often they or\ntheir partner ejaculated without a condom.\nOverall sexual risk was grouped into three categories,\nwith high-risk sex defined according to Canadian AIDS\nSociety guidelines [25]: 1) no sex within the past year; 2)\nlow- to moderate-risk sex, including oral sex, or genital\nor anal sex without ejaculate (or ejaculation with a con-\ndom), and; 3) high-risk sex, defined as insertive or recep-\ntive genital or anal sex with fluid contact. Sex without\nfluid exposure also included sex where fluid exposurewas to non-flesh genitals, such as penile prosthetics. Par-\nticipants who engaged in “high-risk” activities, but only\nin the context of sex with a single HIV-seroconcordant\nregular partner or spouse were classified as low risk.\nTo assess history of sex work or exchange sex, partici-\npants were asked whether they had “ever done sex work\nor exchanged sex for money or other resources (e.g. shelter,\ndrugs, food)?” Current sex work status was coded for those\nwho indicated sex work or escort work on a multi-category\nitem assessing type of paid work currently done.\nHIV testing and status\nParticipants indicated whether they had ever been tested\nfor HIV, and if so the recentness of their last test. HIV\nstatus was self-reported.\nStatistical analysis\nFrequencies were estimated using Respondent-Driven\nSampling Analysis Tool version 6.0 [26]. All statistical\nestimates presented were weighted using RDS I estima-\ntion techniques [22,27], based on the probability of re-\ncruitment, to produce estimates for the Ontario trans\npopulation. Weighting accounts for differences in net-\nwork sizes, as participants who are less well connected\nare less likely to be recruited, as well as for differential\nrecruitment rates across groups [27]. This adjusts for\nhomophily, the tendency of people to know, and thus re-\ncruit, people who are more like themselves. A modified\nbootstrapping approach was used to construct 95% con-\nfidence intervals [23,28], with 10,000 resamples through\nrecruitment chains. The enhanced data-smoothing algo-\nrithm was applied [23].\nWhile statistical tests designed for random samples\ncannot be conducted using networked RDS data, vari-\nance recovery methods make possible the testing for\nstatistical significance of differences between two propor-\ntions. Zou and Donner’s MOVER method was used to\nconstruct confidence intervals around the difference in\nproportions [29]. Where derived confidence intervals\nexcluded 0, differences in frequencies were determined\nto be statistically significantly at p< 0.05.\nResults\nA total of 433 trans Ontarians participated in the study.\nA network diagram showing the recruitment structure\nof the sample is presented in Figure 1, coded for MTF\nversus FTM gender spectrum and overall HIV-related\nsexual risk. Maximum recruitment chain length was 10\nwaves beyond the initial seeds.\nSocio-demographic results are presented in Table 2.\nEstimates for age distribution showed a young popula-\ntion of trans Ontarians, with 33% aged 16–24 years,\nand only 9% over age 55. An estimated 33% of trans\npeople lived in metropolitan Toronto. The geographic\nFigure 1 Recruitment networks for trans study participants in Ontario, Canada (n = 433).

BMC Public Health 2012, 12:292 Page 5 of 12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/292distribution of trans Ontarians around the province\nwas similar for FTMs and MTFs with the exception\nof Toronto and the surrounding south central Ontario\nregion. While a similar proportion lived in the com-\nbined regions, FTMs were more likely to live in Toronto\nthan the surrounding area. Non-Aboriginal racialized trans\npeople were significantly more likely to live in metropol-\nitan Toronto than were non-Aboriginal white trans Ontar-\nians. Among non-Aboriginal racialized trans people, about\ntwo-thirds (62%) were born outside of Canada; most lived\nin Toronto (65%) and Central Ontario (19%), and were\nhighly educated, reflecting general population patterns for\nthis group. We did not find evidence of depressed income\nlevels among non-Aboriginal racialized trans people rela-\ntive to white trans people, as incomes were low across all\ngroups. An estimated 49% of trans people earned less than\n$15,000 per year, and 34% lived in poverty, with household\nincome that fell below the Statistics Canada low-income\ncut-off based on household size.\nMTFs were less likely to be living in their core gender,\neven part-time, than were FTMs. While the proportion of\ntrans people that had completed a medical transition was\nsimilar between gender spectrums, a higher proportion of\nMTFs were in the process of medically transitioning,\nwhereas a higher proportion of FTMs were planning to\nmedically transition, but had not begun. Though the three\nethno-racial groups did not differ with regard to living in\ntheir core gender full-time, part-time or not at all, they\nwere quite different with regard to medical transition sta-\ntus. In particular, while the proportion having completed\n(by one’s own definition) a medical transition was again\nsimilar across groups, non-Aboriginal racialized transpeople were significantly less likely than each of the other\ngroups to be in the process of medically transitioning (11%\nvs. 41% for Aboriginal and 24% for white), and more likely\nto have reported that the concept of transitioning does not\napply to them (20% vs. 6% and 8%).\nDemographics for Ontario trans people were similar to\nOntario data from the 2006 Canadian Census with re-\ngard to ethno-racial group, education, region of resi-\ndence, and birth in or outside of Canada (census data\nnot shown). However, trans people were younger than\nthe census population, and had lower personal annual\nincomes. Moreover, while overall ethno-racial distribu-\ntions were similar to the Ontario population, our data\nindicated greater ethno-racial diversity among FTMs\nthan among MTFs.\nSexual behavioural data are presented in Table 3. Over\nthe lifetime and in the past-year timeframes, trans people\nwere highly heterogeneous with regard to sex partner\nnumbers and types, as well as for the types of sex they\nengaged in. The majority of trans people in all groups\nwere not at high risk for sexually acquired HIV within\nthe past year. A high proportion did not have any past-\nyear sex partners: an estimated 25% of FTMs and a sig-\nnificantly higher 51% of MTFs. This factor contributed\nto differences in HIV-related sexual risk profiles by gen-\nder spectrum, with MTFs being more likely to be at no\npast-year risk due to a lack of partner sex, but also sig-\nnificantly more likely to report high-risk sex.

Within each group\nabout 15% had ever engaged in sex work or exchange\nsex, and 2% reported current employment as a sex\nworker or escort.\nThere were also differences in past-year sex risk by\nethno-racial group, though these primarily stem from\nnon-Aboriginal racialized trans people being more likely\nto have had sex (low-risk) within the past year than non-\nAboriginal white trans people; there were no significant\ndifferences in high-risk sex across ethno-racial groups.\nSelf-reported history of HIV testing and HIV status are\npresented in Table 4. Self-reported prevalences of HIV\nwere 0.6% for FTMs (95% CI: not calculable) and 3% for\nMTFs (95% CI: 0, 5). The estimate for self-reported HIV\nprevalence appeared higher for Aboriginal trans people\n(17%), however the confidence interval ranged from 0%\nto 28% indicating little precision in this smallest group\n(n = 35).\nThe self-reported prevalence of HIV testing was low,\nwith an estimated 46% of Ontario trans people (95% CI:\n38, 55) having never been tested. While lifetime testing did\nnot differ between FTMs and MTFs, each of the three\nethno-racial groups differed significantly from the other\ntwo. Aboriginal trans people were the most likely to ever\nhave been tested for HIV, followed by non-Aboriginal\nwhites, with non-Aboriginal racialized people least likelyto have been tested. An estimated 67% (95% CI: 46, 81)\nof non-Aboriginal racialized people have never been\ntested for HIV.\nDiscussion\nThis study contributes significant and critical informa-\ntion to the literature addressing HIV-related risk in trans\ncommunities. First, the study uses respondent-driven\nsampling, which through design and analysis strategies\nminimizes biases associated with convenience sampling\nthat are present in the published literature. The estimates\nof HIV-related risk behaviours are considerably lower\nthan in studies where convenience samples were used.\nTrans people were also more heterogeneous with regard\nto sex partner numbers and types, as well as for the\ntypes of sex they engaged in, with the majority not at\nhigh risk for sexually acquired HIV within the past year.\nA high proportion (one quarter of FTMs and half of\nMTFs) did not have any past-year sex partners, contrib-\nuting to low prevalences of high-risk sex. FTMs reported\nunprotected receptive genital sex and MTFs insertive\ngenital sex as the most common high-risk behaviours.\nUnlike other studies, high-risk sex did not differ across\nethno-racial groups, though HIV testing history did. Low\nrates of HIV testing among trans people in Ontario were\nreported, compared to other jurisdictions, with the low-\nest lifetime testing among non-Aboriginal racialized\npeople and the highest among Aboriginal people. In\naddition, while the focus of previous studies suggests that\nTable 3 Sexual Behaviours: Weighted frequencies for trans people in Ontario, Canada\nAll trans people\nn= 433\nFemale-to-Male\nspectrum n=227\nMale-to-Female\nspectrum n=205\nAboriginal\nn = 35\nNon-aboriginal\nwhite n= 333\nNon-aboriginal\nracialized\nn= 62\n% 95% CI % 95% CI % 95% CI % 95% CI % 95% CI % 95% CI\nSex partner number, lifetime\n0 14 (10, 25) 16 (6, 24) 15 (8, 25) 14 (0, 26) 14 (10, 25) 19 (4, 40)\n1 13 (6, 19) 19 (8, 30) 10 (3, 16) 4 (0, 14) 13 (6, 19) 18 (4, 32)\n2–4 19 (11, 24) 18 (11, 21) 23 (13, 31) 24 (9, 61) 19 (11, 24) 16 (3, 30)\n5–9 20 (15, 30) 13 (6, 20) 22 (17, 36) 6 (0, 15) 20 (15, 30) 8 (2, 19)\n10–19 17 (11, 25) 23 (14, 32) 12 (4, 18) 31 (0, 60) 17 (11, 25) 22 (5, 44)\n20–49 8 (4, 12) 7 (4, 12) 9 (3, 15) 15 (4, 30) 8 (4, 12) 7 (1, 17)\n50 + 8 (3, 12) 6 (2, 11) 10 (3, 17) 6 (0, 15) 8 (3, 12) 11 (0.2, 23)\nSex partners, lifetime\nTrans men 18 (13, 26) 18 (10, 25) 9 (4, 14) 5 (0, 15) 18 (13, 26) 8 (3, 19)\nNon-trans men 42 (32, 50) 45 (34, 57) 40 (29, 52) 54 (26, 79) 42 (32, 50) 46 (24, 67)\nTrans women 16 (9, 22) 11 (5, 19) 19 (11, 29) 14 (4, 29) 16 (9, 22) 15 (3, 31)\nNon-trans women 72 (62, 80) 66 (52, 77) 68 (55, 79) 45 (22, 70) 72 (62, 80) 54 (32, 76)\nGenderqueer persons 25 (18, 35) 32 (21, 42) 12 (6, 20) 16 (4, 33) 25 (18, 35) 24 (10, 41)\nSex partner number, past yr\n0 39 (33, 51) 25 (15, 36) 51 (40, 64) 35 (12, 64) 39 (33, 51) 22 (7, 39)\n1 35 (26, 43) 43 (31, 54) 26 (15, 36) 24 (3, 55) 35 (26, 43) 39 (17, 59)\n2–4 17 (12, 25) 20 (12, 30) 12 (6, 20) 9 (0.7, 23) 17 (12, 25) 13 (4, 30)\n5 + 8 (3, 11) 12 (5, 21) 11 (4, 19) 31 (3, 63) 8 (3, 11) 26 (6, 49)\nSex partners, past yr\nTrans men 8 (4, 13) 10 (5, 16) 4 (1, 7) 3 (0, 11) 8 (4, 13) 7 (2, 13)\nNon-trans men 26 (15, 36) 21 (13, 31) 23 (13, 32) 45 (14, 67) 26 (15, 36) 23 (9, 46)\nTrans women 11 (5, 16) 7 (2, 13) 14 (6, 23) 6 (0.1, 17) 11 (5, 16) 13 (2, 29)\nNon-trans women 34 (26, 42) 44 (32, 53) 24 (15, 34) 14 (0.5, 34) 34 (26, 42) 39 (22, 65)\nGenderqueer persons 8 (4, 14) 14 (6, 21) 3 (1, 5) 5 (0, 13) 8 (4, 14) 12 (3, 26)\nSexual behaviours, past yr *\nReceived oral sex 47 (37, 56) 60 (46, 71) 37 (26, 48) 61 (32, 85) 47 (37, 56) 66 (43, 83)\nGave oral sex 51 (41, 60) 61 (48, 73) 45 (35, 57) 57 (30, 86) 51 (41, 60) 72 (55, 88)\nReceptive partner in anal sex 24 (16, 30) 28 (16, 38) 29 (19, 41) 40 (13, 70) 24 (16, 30) 47 (21, 65)\nInsertive partner in anal sex 18 (11, 24) 26 (16, 36) 14 (7, 22) 7 (0.1, 21) 18 (11, 24) 44 (19, 63)\nReceptive partner in genital sex 40 (32, 51) 57 (46, 68) 16 (8, 27) 17 (3, 40) 40 (32, 51) 51 (28, 69)\nInsertive partner in genital sex 46 (36, 55) 55 (43, 66) 32 (21, 44) 23 (3, 49) 46 (36, 55) 49 (27, 76)\nFluid-exposed sexual behaviours, past yr **\nHigh-risk receptive anal sex 2 (0.3, 4) 0 (0, 0.1) 4 (1, 8) 4 (0, 14) 2 (0.3, 4) 2 (0, 6)\nHigh-risk insertive anal sex 2 (0.1, 4) 0 (−−, –) 4 (0.3, 9) 0 (−−,–) 2 (0.1, 4) 1 (0, 5)\nHigh-risk receptive genital sex 6 (1, 11) 7 (1, 14) 3 (0, 14) 4 (0, 13) 6 (1, 11) 0.4 (0, 2)\nHigh-risk insertive genital sex 9 (4, 15) 0.6 (0, 3) 16 (8, 26) 0 (−−,–) 9 (4, 15) 4 (0.2, 10)\nHIV-related sexual risk, past yr\nNo risk (no sex) 38 (31, 49) 25 (15, 36) 50 (39, 63) 35 (14, 61) 38 (31, 49) 19 (6, 37)\nLow/moderate risk 48 (38, 57) 69 (57, 79) 31 (20, 40) 60 (34, 83) 48 (38, 57) 76 (58, 90)\nHigh risk 14 (7, 19) 7 (1, 14) 19 (10, 30) 4 (0, 14) 14 (7, 19) 5 (1, 11)\nBauer et al.

BMC Public Health 2012, 12:292 Page 9 of 12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/292sex work is largely the purview of MTFs, in this study,\nMTFs and FTMs did not differ in both their historic and\ncurrent engagement in sex work. Finally, prevalences of\nHIV infection were lower compared with other studies\nthat used convenience sampling. Given low prevalences of\ntesting and low statistical precision, however, estimates for\nself-reported HIV prevalence of 0.6% for FTMs and 3% for\nMTFs should be interpreted with caution.\nThat our estimates for trans people were similar to the\nbroad Ontario population with regard to education, re-\ngion of residence, and birth within versus outside of\nCanada, support the success of our sampling method in\nreaching trans people broadly. However, trans people\nconstitute a hidden population, and it is not known to\nwhat extent trans demographics actually mirror popula-\ntion demographics. To assume similarity would be to as-\nsume trans people are born at, transition at, immigrate\nat, and survive at rates proportionate to the population,\nand there are reasons to expect that this may not be true.\nViolence against trans people and suicide, in particular,\nhave been recently raised as serious health and equity\nconcerns [30-32]. These may seriously impact the sur-\nvival of trans people, though little published research\nexists. Immigration, transition and survival may also ex-\nplain, to some extent, the reduced ethno-racial diversity\namong MTFs in particular.

Trans population estimates describe a\npopulation that is younger and has lower personal in-\ncome than Ontarians broadly. A younger age distribution\nhas been observed consistently across trans studies. This\nmay in part explain low incomes, as income generally\nincreases with age, however high levels of employment\ndiscrimination have been documented [33], and it is un-\nlikely that low incomes are simply an age-related effect.\nExisting trans-specific or trans-friendly services, while\nlimited, are concentrated in Toronto. That two-thirds of\ntrans people did not live in metropolitan Toronto illus-\ntrates the need for development of trans-friendly services\nin smaller Ontario cities and towns. A recent popula-\ntion-based study, using a broad definition of transgender,\nestimated that 0.5% of the adult Massachusetts population\nwas trans [34]. While it is not clear how this estimate\nwould apply to the Ontario population, as a population-\nbased estimate it represents the best information to date.\nApplying this estimate to the 2008 population of\n10,710,200 Ontario residents over age 15 [35] (to most\nclosely match the 16-year age limit of our study), we would\nestimate that there are approximately 53,500 trans resi-\ndents of Ontario, 36,000 of whom do not live in Toronto.trans people in Ontario, Canada\ne-to-Female\ntrum n=205\nAboriginal\nn = 35\nNon-aboriginal\nwhite n= 333\nNon-aboriginal\nracialized n= 62\n95% CI % 95% CI % 95% CI % 95% CI\n(8, 23) 8 (0, 20) 10 (5, 14) 4 (0, 9)\n(5, 19) 34 (13, 67) 8 (3, 12) 13 (4, 36)\n(6, 21) 22 (0, 41) 15 (9, 20) 5 (0, 12)\n(11, 29) 22 (7, 44) 23 (18, 34) 10 (3, 20)\n(31, 54) 15 (3, 36) 44 (35, 54) 67 (46, 81)\n(0, 5) 17 (0, 28) 2 (0, 2) 3 (−−-, –)\n(64, 86) 50 (32, 89) 74 (69, 84) 71 (63, 94)\n(15, 35) 24 (1, 55) 24 (15, 30) 23 (6, 37)\n(0, 0.4) 9 (0, 17) 0.3 (0, 0.4) 3 (−−-, –)\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:292 Page 10 of 12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/292Self-reported HIV prevalence was estimated at 0.6%\nfor FTMs and 3% for MTFs, higher than expected based\non overall population estimates for Ontario. In 2008,\nthere were an estimated 26,627 prevalent HIV infections\nin Ontario [36], for a 2008 population of 10,710,200 resi-\ndents age 15 and over [35], representing an overall HIV\nprevalence of 0.25% or 1 in 400. Of these, it has been\nestimated that two-thirds, or about 0.17%, were aware of\ntheir HIV status [36]. Estimates from the current analysis\nare that 2% of trans people (1.7% without rounding) self-\nreport HIV positivity, 10 times the expected baseline\nvalue. However, given the width of the confidence inter-\nvals and the high proportion of trans people that had\nnever been tested, it is not possible to accurately estimate\nHIV prevalence from these survey data. As in any study,\nthere are limitations to this analysis. While estimates from\nRDS have been shown to be statistically unbiased [27],\nconfidence intervals are wide. For this reason, point esti-\nmates should not be over-interpreted, but rather inter-\npreted with regard to the range of plausible values.\nSelf-reported HIV prevalence was lower than in other\nstudies with more urban, street-active samples (e.g. 11.8%\nfrom a U.S. meta-analysis for MTFs) [3]. While existing\nstudies point to extremely high vulnerability to HIV within\nsegments of trans communities in some cities, our evi-\ndence did not support the existence of such high levels on\na broader population basis in Ontario. Our estimates were\nsimilar to, though slightly lower than, the self-report esti-\nmates obtained in the U.S. National Transgender Discrim-\nination Survey [31]; prevalences of HIV and other sexually\ntransmitted infections in Canada are lower than those in\nthe U.S, in general. Whether between-study differences re-\nflect effects of sampling high-risk versus broad population\ngroups of trans participants, differences related to testing,\nor differences between actual HIV risk and prevalence in\nthe U.S. and other countries versus Canada is unclear.\nWhile it is not a perfect remedy, Canada has human rights\nprotections in place for trans people (under the grounds of\nsex) that do not exist in many other jurisdictions. Further,\nwithin Canada, most health care services are freely\navailable to all Canadians, with administration and\ndelivery responsibilities falling on each province or\nterritory. Additionally, costs of specific surgeries asso-\nciated with transitioning are covered in some pro-\nvinces and territories, including Ontario. Costs for\nprescription drugs, including hormones, are largely\nnot covered by the public health care system, but are\nlower than in the U.S. It is possible that existing pro-\ntections may serve to mitigate some of the serious\neffects of discrimination, and the health inequities\nthey produce.\nIt is important to note that self-reported estimates are\nlikely underestimates of actual HIV prevalence. About a\nquarter of trans people reported that they were unsure oftheir HIV status, and about half have never been tested.\nHistory of testing varied significantly by ethno-racial\ngroup, but not by gender spectrum. Only 15% of Abori-\nginal trans people had never been tested, versus 44% of\nnon-Aboriginal white people and 67% of non-Aboriginal\nracialized people. While we were not able to determine\nwhy these differences may exist, it is possible that the\nhigher testing rates in Aboriginal trans people result from\ninclusive campaigns targeting Two-Spirit people. Outside\nof Aboriginal communities, campaigns targeting MSM, for\nexample, may not even seem relevant to trans MSM. It is\nalso possible that the greater awareness of HIV-related\nissues in Canadian Aboriginal communities may also con-\ntribute to increased perception of risk by Aboriginal trans\npeople or their health care providers.\nIt is surprising that HIV testing was so low, given that\nit is free across the province of Ontario, and anonymous\ntesting is available in most jurisdictions. As a compari-\nson, despite similarities in estimates of partner types,\nMTF vs. FTM frequencies of sex, and transition status, a\nsurvey of trans people in Virginia found that only 18%\nhad never been tested for HIV [37], versus 46% in our\nstudy. It has been argued that Canada’s punitive HIV\nnon-disclosure laws, in place since 1998, may deter\npeople from testing [38]. In the context of HIV testing\nservices, barriers to inclusion can also occur due to eras-\nure of trans people at the informational and institutional\nlevels [21]. Erasure is the process through which trans\npeople, and by extension trans communities, are system-\natically rendered invisible through passive or active ex-\nclusion, including the assumption that information on\ntrans people, or policies to accommodate them are not\nrelevant [21]. As an example, for many years the largest\nanonymous HIV testing site in Ontario’s largest city had\n“men’s days” and “women’s days” and when to attend –\nand indeed the safety of attending – was unclear to po-\ntential users who were trans. It is not readily apparent\nwhich factors affect HIV testing, and to what extent\nnon-testing is due to low risk of HIV versus barriers that\nprevent testing in moderate- to high-risk individuals.\nThe profile of HIV risk with regard to sexual beha-\nviours is highly heterogeneous. In the past year, MTF\nindividuals were both more likely to have high-risk sex\nand to not have partner sex at all. Population statistics\nindicate that about 16% of a young- to middle-age adult\npopulation will not have had sex in a given year [39].\nThat half of MTFs and a quarter of FTMs have not had\npast-year sex is likely indicative of the difficulties trans\npeople face in finding romantic or sexual partners. Gen-\nder spectrum differences may be due to a greater diffi-\nculty for MTFs in finding good romantic or sexual\npartners who will see them as their core gender sexually;\neffects of hormonal treatments on sex drive may possibly\nplay a contributing role. Based on the comparisons of\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:292 Page 11 of 12\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/292ethno-racial groups, only non-Aboriginal racialized trans\npeople were similar to expected population levels with re-\ngard to having past-year partner sex; an estimated 81%\nhad sex and 19% did not. While non-Aboriginal racialized\ntrans people were more likely to be sexually active than\nother trans ethno-racial groups, this did not correspond\nwith an increase in high-risk sex or in sex while drunk or\nhigh, where proportions were similar to other groups.\nWhile sexual behaviours—which could involve penetra-\ntion with fingers, penile prostheses, or toys as well as flesh\ngenitals—were highly varied, most did not correspond to\nhigh-risk (i.e. flesh contact and fluid exposed) activities.\nIndeed, the greatest contributors to HIV-related sexual\nrisk were the two sexual activities some might assume\ntrans people are unlikely to engage in: receptive genital\nsex for FTMs, and insertive genital sex for MTFs. For\nMTFs at least, this differs from some previous studies. For\nexample, in one San Francisco study, of over 300 MTFs,\nonly 2 had insertive genital sex in the prior 6 months [1].\nWhile most research on trans sex workers focuses on\nMTFs, FTMs in our study were similar with regard to\nsex work histories, as well as current sex work. Other\nstudies have documented high frequencies for sex work\namong trans men in U.S. cities [1]. It is unknown\nwhether FTMs engaged in sex work while presenting as\nmale or female, and whether the frequency and duration\nof sex work involvement is similar to MTFs.\nOverall, the sexual risk profile observed for Ontario\ntrans people is quite different from the bulk of existing\nstudies. The breadth of the population, both geographically\nand demographically, may provide a broader picture of\ntrans sexuality and health outside of urban centres. More-\nover, it may be that effects of transphobic discrimination in\nCanada are mitigated by the existence of legal human\nrights protections and processes for redress, and by the\nsocial safety net to the extent that it exists. While some\nsegments of trans communities in Ontario are at higher\nrisk than others, we do not see evidence of uniformly high\nrisk. Indeed, the majority of trans people were not at high\nrisk for sexually acquired HIV in the past year.\nConclusions\nIn most jurisdictions in Canada and elsewhere, epide-\nmiologic surveillance statistics for HIV do not include\ntrans people, despite arguments from researchers that a\ndemographic category should be created [8]. Because\ndata do not identify trans people, it is difficult to know\nto what extent they are impacted by HIV. Moreover,\npopulation health surveys that assess HIV-related issues\nsuch as sexual behaviour or substance use very rarely in-\nclude measures to identify trans participants, though\nsome surveys have recently added detailed measures\n[40]. Additional population-level data, in the form of sur-\nveillance statistics, probability-based population healthsurvey data, or trans-specific studies that take a large-\nscale population approach are needed to provide an ac-\ncurate picture of HIV and trans health more broadly.\nSelf-reported HIV prevalence among trans people in\nthis broad population sample appears higher than\nexpected based on provincial levels, similar to another\nbroad sample in the U.S.[31], and lower than the very\nhigh prevalences observed in U.S. and international\nurban samples with heavy representations of street-active\nand sex working MTFs. Additional research is needed to\nunderstand with greater accuracy the distribution of\nHIV-related risk within diverse trans communities, and\nto develop programs and policies to protect those at\nhighest risk. Specific information on trans people outside\nof urban centres, within ethno-racial communities, in-\ncluding Aboriginal communities, and on trans youth are\nneeded. Moreover, qualitative or mixed-methods studies\nmay be useful in illuminating the experiences of trans\npeople with regard to HIV-related decision-making, test-\ning, treatment, and prevention.\nLow rates of HIV testing make our self-reported preva-\nlence difficult to interpret with regard to true HIV preva-\nlence. Additional research also needs to be conducted to\nexamine reasons for the observed low testing rates\namong trans Ontarians, and to explore why these may\ndiffer by ethno-racial group. Trans-sensitive HIV testing\nand prevention programs are needed throughout the\nprovince. Trans sexuality is not easily captured in con-\nventional ways of thinking about HIV-related risk, and\nour results caution against making any assumptions\nabout the types of sex trans people have, the body parts\nthey use, or who their sex partners are. This has implica-\ntions for design of prevention and education programs.\nAbbreviations\nFTM: Female-to-male gender spectrum; HIV: Human immunodeficiency virus;\nLICO: Low-income cut-off; MTF: Male-to-female gender spectrum.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAcknowledgments\nThe research presented here was supported by an operating grant from the\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research, HIV/AIDS Community-Based Research\nProgram (Funding Reference # 167492).
