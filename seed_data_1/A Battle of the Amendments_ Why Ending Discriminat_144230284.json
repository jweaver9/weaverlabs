NOTES A BATTLE OF THE AMENDMENTS: WHY ENDING DISCRIMINATION IN THE COURTROOM MAY INHIBIT A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT’S RIGHT TO AN IMPARTIAL JURY Gina M. Chiappetta*  Since the U.S. Supreme Court began limiting the exercise of peremptory challenges to safeguard potential jurors from discrimination, it has faced a nearly impossible task.  The Court has attempted to safeguard a juror’s equal protection rights without eradicating the peremptory challenge’s ability to preserve a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury.  Under the current legal framework, it is not certain whether either constitutional right is adequately protected.  This Note examines the history of the Supreme Court’s limitation on peremptory challenges.  It then discusses the current federal circuit split over whether peremptory challenges should be further limited.  Finally, this Note concludes that the existing framework’s application should be extended and restricted to more effectively protect the constitutional rights at issue.

Kentucky,6 very narrowly.  It held that prosecutors could not exercise peremptory strikes against veniremen solely on the basis that they share the same race as the defendant.7 Justice Thurgood Marshall did not have much faith in the Court’s solution, however.  He predicted that ending racial discrimination in the jury selection process would “be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely.”8  Three decades later, the peremptory challenge no longer lives up to its name.  In several attempts to temper the  1. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 82 (1986).  2. Id. at 83.  3. Id.  4. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 220 (1965).  5.

Id. at 102–03 (Marshall, J., concurring).  2000 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 discrimination peremptory challenges facilitate, Batson has been extended far beyond its original bounds.9  Now, civil and criminal litigants are prohibited from peremptorily dismissing a venireman based on their race or gender, regardless of whether the stricken juror shares the race or gender of a litigant.10  Whether or not Batson can be applied to further limit the procedure, however, is complicated. Batson’s scope has been narrowed so that peremptory challenges may be freely exercised against any group entitled to rational basis review under the Fourteenth Amendment.11  For example, race and gender, classifications entitled to heightened scrutiny, are unconstitutional bases for peremptory challenges.12  Mental handicap, on the other hand, is a permissible basis for a peremptory strike, as a classification only entitled to rational basis review.13  This limiting principle is not as easily applied, however, when it is unclear to which standard of review a group is entitled. SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories,14 an antitrust dispute between two producers of HIV medication, demonstrates the confusion plaguing the Batson regime.15  The district court needed to decide whether a peremptory challenge against a homosexual member of the venire potentially violated Batson.16  SmithKline’s counsel argued that the “well-known” presence of AIDS in the homosexual community motivated Abbott to exercise its peremptory challenge on the basis of the juror’s sexual orientation.17  The judge responded, “Well, I don’t know that, number one, whether Batson applies in civil, and number two, whether Batson ever applies to sexual orientation.”18  Ultimately, the Batson challenge was rejected.19  Yet, on appeal, the Ninth Circuit became the second circuit to recognize sexual orientation as a classification entitled to heightened scrutiny, and the first federal court to prohibit the exercise of peremptory challenges based on sexual orientation.20 It is uncertain not only whether the Batson regime permits such a prohibition but also whether the Ninth Circuit’s expansion will successfully prevent discriminatory peremptory strikes.  As Justice Marshall predicted, despite several limitations on the exercise of peremptory challenges, the jury selection process continues to evince many kinds of discrimination.21  Still, in the face of more than thirty years of persistent criticism, the peremptory strike has persevered.  9.

To this end, Part I discusses the merits and shortcomings of peremptory challenges, and explains the ways in which Batson and subsequent cases limit the exercise of peremptory strikes.  Part II discusses the two interpretations of Batson’s scope employed by the federal circuit courts.  The first prohibits and the second permits sexual orientation–based peremptory strikes.  Part III critically assesses the Batson regime and suggests that, to reduce the costs of further regulation of peremptory strikes, the Batson framework be altered to limit the circumstances under which a Batson challenge may be raised. I.   UNDERSTANDING THE BATSON REGIME AND ITS REGULATION OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES The Supreme Court once defined a peremptory strike of a venireman23 as a challenge “exercised without a reason stated, without inquiry and without being subject to the court’s control.”24  In 1986, however, the Court decided Batson.  This seminal case used the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause25 to empower courts to limit the motives with which a party may exercise peremptory strikes.26  Part I.A discusses the virtues and deficiencies of limiting peremptory challenges.  Part I.B traces the evolution of Supreme Court doctrine governing the exercise of peremptory strikes.  Part I.C explores how the Fourteenth Amendment’s three-tiered system of judicial review limits the scope of Batson’s protections. A.   Peremptory Challenges:  Their Merits and Shortcomings During voir dire27 proceedings, litigants have the opportunity to question prospective jurors to gain information that enables them to remove jurors from the venire.28  There are two procedures that facilitate this removal:  for-cause and peremptory challenges.  A party may remove a prospective juror from the venire either by arguing to excuse a venireman peremptorily  22. See infra Part I.A.1.  23. BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1789 (10th ed. 2014) (“A prospective juror; a member of a jury panel.”).  24. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 220 (1965).  25. U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1 (“No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”).  26. See generally Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).  27. See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1805 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “voir dire” as the preliminary examination of prospective jurors by a judge or lawyer to decide whether “the prospect is qualified and suitable to serve on a jury” that is informally referred to as “the jury-selection phase of a trial”).  28. See id. at 1789 (“A ‘venire’ is a panel of persons selected for jury duty and from among whom the jurors are to be chosen.”).  2002 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 or for-cause.29  So long as it offers a “narrowly specified, provable and legally cognizable basis of partiality” for a strike, a litigant may exercise an unlimited number of for-cause challenges.30  Common bases of for-cause strikes include a prospective juror’s “familial or social relationship to one of the parties, failure to meet statutory qualifications for jury duty, or other specific evidence of bias.”31 A peremptory strike, on the other hand, need not be “supported by a reason.”32  Rather, a peremptory challenge, theoretically, allows a party to exclude a member of the venire without justifying the strike to the court.33  In recent decades, however, the Supreme Court has defined certain circumstances in which a party must divulge its reason for peremptorily striking a venireman.34  As the application of Batson has been expanded to limit the exercise of peremptory challenges, so too has the litany of arguments in favor of, and against, preserving the practice.35 To grasp the split among federal courts of appeals, it is important to understand the virtues and shortcomings of peremptory challenges. 1.   Arguments in Favor of Maintaining Peremptory Challenges The perseverance of peremptory challenges throughout history is often cited as a justification for their continued use.36  While peremptory challenges have been part of almost every system of jury trial, “from the Romans to today,” American colonists adopted the peremptory challenge from the eighteenth-century English legal system.37  Under that regime, the prosecutor was afforded unlimited exercise of peremptory strikes, whereas criminal defendants were allotted only thirty-five.38  While the use of such challenges was considered a “right” in American Colonies,39 the practice  29.

T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 144–45 (1994) (explaining that, as with “race-based Batson claims,” counsel must articulate its basis for a peremptory challenge only if a prima facie case of intentional discrimination is established); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 97 (1986) (holding that if a party establishes a prima facie case that opposing counsel has exercised a peremptory strike based on juror’s race, opposing counsel may refute the accusation by a articulating non-discriminatory reason for the strike).  35.

Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 214–17 (1965) (discussing the origins of the peremptory challenge in United States).  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2003 was not adopted by the U.S. Constitution.40  Nonetheless, the exercise of peremptory strikes is incorporated into both federal and state statutes, and their use continues uninterrupted in the United States.41  The historical persistence of peremptory strikes “demonstrate[s] the long and widely held belief that peremptory challenge is a necessary part of trial by jury.”42 In addition to this history, the use of peremptory challenges is justified as a method by which a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury43 is safeguarded.44  Since no objective basis to peremptorily strike a juror must be offered, parties may remove a prospective juror based simply on a negative intuition, “not necessarily capable of clear articulation,” that a juror maintains a certain bias.45  In other words, peremptory challenges ensure that a partial venireman will not remain on the jury simply because an attorney is unable to prove his or her bias.46 Moreover, peremptory challenges allow litigants, “those whose fortunes are at issue,” to choose their own jury.47  Consider that, without having to meet any sort of legal standard, a litigant may dismiss any person he or she dislikes from the venire.  This gives the litigants, and through them, the public, confidence that “the jury is a good and proper mode for deciding matters and that its decision should be followed.”48  It is important not only that the jury be fair and impartial, but also that to the litigants, it seems to be so.49  “As Justice Frankfurter once wrote:  ‘The appearance of impartiality is an essential manifestation of its reality.’”50 Peremptory strikes also protect jurors and promote the efficiency and integrity of the voir dire proceedings.51  During voir dire, lawyers and judges ask prospective jurors about their “private attitudes and practices— 40. Stilson v. United States, 250 U.S. 583, 586 (1919) (“There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which requires the Congress to grant peremptory challenges to defendants in criminal cases; trial by an impartial jury is all that is secured.”).  41.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 91 (1986) (stating that the use of peremptory strikes is “one means of assuring the selection of a qualified and unbiased jury”).  45. Carlson, supra note 36, at 954. Insuring a party’s right to a fair trial has been the historical justification for a system that allows the unchallenged exercise of peremptory strikes. Allowing counsel to strike prospective jurors without enunciating a reason is a recognition of the many biases and prejudices that all humans foster, and of the potential for a prospective juror’s failure to perceive that bias. It would be fruitless to inquire of unknown prejudices that a juror might harbor. Id. at 953–54.  46. See id.  47. Babcock, supra note 29, at 552.  48. Id.  49. Id.  50. Id. (quoting Dennis v.

Arguments in Favor of Eliminating Peremptory Challenges Critics of the peremptory strike argue that the procedure may actually inhibit a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury.   52.

Although experience reveals that black males as a class can be biased against young alienated blacks who have not tried to join the middle class, to enunciate this in the concrete expression required of a challenge for cause is societally divisive.

See infra Part I.A.2.  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2005 They posit that parties do not exercise peremptory strikes in order to ensure an impartial jury at all.63  Instead, each selects jurors who will be partial or amenable to their position.64  Furthermore, the Supreme Court, in Batson, rejected the argument that since both parties have the ability to select jurors that are partial to their side, the juror’s biases will cancel each other out.65 As such, critics argue that eliminating or reducing the number of peremptory challenges would result in a more efficient and cost-effective jury selection process.66  Without peremptory strikes, they argue, fewer veniremen would be excluded from the jury, thus, expediting the voir dire process and resulting in fewer citizens being called for jury duty.67  Moreover, litigants would save money and time spent consulting so-called jury experts who specialize in determining which jurors will be favorable to their side.68  Should peremptory challenges be eliminated, trial courts would also save time by avoiding Batson hearings69 to determine if a party silently employed a permissible motive when peremptorily excusing a juror.70 The use of peremptory challenges to select a jury, either partial or impartial, also appears to necessitate prejudgment of individuals, a practice that is seemingly inconsistent with “democratic ideals such as equality and fairness.”71  By its nature, a peremptory strike is discriminatory and “reflects a preconceived notion or negative intuition as to how a prospective juror will evaluate one’s client and case.”72 Peremptory challenges may also compromise the cross-sectional ideal73 by allowing a jury to be composed of quite like-minded individuals.74  Such  63.

Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 130 (1940) (“It is part of the established tradition in the use of juries as instruments of public justice that the jury be a body truly representative of the community.”).  “The cross-sectional ideal is based on the idea that there is no way to escape from bias.” Henley, supra note 66, at 4.  “The only way to deal with prejudice is to have a balance of various values and perspectives on the jury.” Id.  74. Henley, supra note 66, at 4.  2006 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 a composition potentially undermines the validity of jury verdicts.75  Consider that when a group is systematically excluded from the jury it is potentially less likely that the verdict will “reflect the values of the community as a whole.”76 Furthermore, a diverse jury arguably increases the probability that individuals with different backgrounds and opinions may be able to correct “mistaken views or recollections of evidence presented at trial.”77  Said differently, peremptory challenges that are used to eliminate jurors based on certain characteristics may increase the probability that prejudices will go unchallenged during deliberation.78  If peremptory strikes are eliminated, a resulting jury could be more representative of the community and, as a result, render a more widely accepted verdict.79 As arguments for further expanding Batson persist, these merits and shortcomings of peremptory strikes must be considered.  For those who believe that the peremptory strike has little power to protect a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury, Batson’s expansion has few, if any, costs.  The opposite is true, however, if the peremptory challenge is considered a safeguard of impartiality. B.   The Evolution of the Batson Challenge:  How the Fourteenth Amendment Limits the Once Unrestricted Exercise of Peremptory Strikes Prior to Batson, the exercise of peremptory challenges, although finite in number, was unrestrained.80  Since that case was decided, however, a number of restrictions have been placed on the exercise of peremptory strikes.  Part I.B.1 introduces the pre-1986 peremptory challenge regime and the cases leading up to the Supreme Court’s decision in Batson.  Part I.B.2 discusses Batson and the Supreme Court’s shift in focus to the Fourteenth Amendment.  Part I.B.3 considers the cases that have expanded Batson’s application, and Part I.B.4 examines the effect these cases have had on the Batson inquiry. 1.

Alabama,93 that the Supreme Court considered whether a prosecutor’s racially discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges violated the Fourteenth Amendment.94  In this case, the defendant moved to void the petit jury95 that convicted him of rape based on “alleged invidious discrimination in the selection of jurors.”96  Supporting the defendant’s contention was evidence that, of the eight black jurors on the petit venire, two were exempt and the other six peremptorily dismissed by the prosecutor.97  Moreover, the record indicated that while blacks were often called to sit on the venire, no black citizen had actually served on a Talladega jury since 1950.98 Evaluating the evidence with the presumption that a prosecutor uses peremptory challenges “to obtain a fair and impartial jury,”99 the Court determined that the evidence in this case fell short of proving “the prosecutor . . . in case after case, whatever the circumstances, . . . [was] responsible for the removal of [African Americans] who [had] been selected as qualified jurors.”100  While the defendant demonstrated that in his own case the prosecutor exercised peremptory strikes to exclude blacks from the jury, the record did not evince how the prosecutor had used the challenges in the past.101  The Court reasoned that the record was “absolutely silent” as to which past instances of exclusion were facilitated by the prosecutor alone.102  Apparently, in some cases, the prosecution agreed with defendants to remove blacks from the jury.103  Absent such a showing, the Court deemed the evidence insufficient to establish, prima facie, that the state applied peremptory challenges in order to systematically exclude jurors based on race.104 Quite consistent with the Supreme Court’s pre-Batson focus on the integrity of the peremptory challenge regime,105 this case provided an “illusory hope . . . [of] racial parity.”106  The possibility of meaningfully challenging a racially discriminatory peremptory strike was essentially negated by the absence of state records detailing prosecutors’ use of  93. 380 U.S. 202 (1965).  94.

Batson v. Kentucky:  A Shift in the Supreme Court’s Focus Prior to its decision in Batson, and as early as Strauder, the Supreme Court seemed to prioritize a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury over a juror’s Fourteenth Amendment protection against discrimination.109  The Court’s landmark 1986 decision in Batson marked a shift in the Court’s focus and demonstrated a greater concern for protecting jurors from discrimination.110 In Batson, the Supreme Court reconsidered the evidentiary burden Swain placed on criminal defendants, claiming the prosecutor’s use of peremptory strikes denied them equal protection.111  In this case, the petitioner, a black man convicted of second-degree burglary and receipt of stolen goods, challenged the prosecutor’s peremptory removal of the only four black jurors on the venire.112  Overruling Swain,113 the Court held that “a defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant’s [own] trial.”114  The decision emphasized that peremptorily excusing a prospective juror based on his or her race was injurious to the defendant and the excluded juror, but also to the public, as it undermined its confidence in the justice system.115  107.

West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 305 (1879) (framing the issue in terms of a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury “impanelled without discrimination” and not in terms of a juror’s right not to be discriminated against).  110.

Selection  2010 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 The real challenge the Court faced was not articulating the constitutional prohibition against race-based peremptory strikes.116  Rather it was the “daunting task of fashioning a mechanism to enforce that prohibition” that presented the biggest challenge.117  The Court crafted a three-step procedure when a party challenges an opponent’s peremptory strike as one based on racial discrimination.118  These three steps have evolved over time. Batson’s first step required a defendant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.119  To do so, the defendant needed to establish that he was part of a cognizable racial group120 and that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to remove venireman of defendant’s race from the jury.121  Then, the defendant also was required to show that the circumstances of the challenged peremptory strikes raised an inference that the prosecutor excluded venireman based on their race.122  To determine whether this preliminary inference of purposeful discrimination existed, the trial court was instructed to “consider all relevant circumstances.”123 If the defendant successfully established a prima facie case, the burden would shift to the state to provide a neutral explanation for having challenged the black jurors.124  The state did not have to justify the exercise of a for-cause challenge.125  Rather, the prosecutor only had to furnish an explanation that did not violate Equal Protection guarantees.126  Namely, the prosecutor could not justify the peremptory challenge on the assumption or intuition that the jurors would not be impartial because they were of the same race as the defendant.127  Should the prosecutor fail to furnish a race-procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.”).  116.

That goal can be accomplished only by eliminating peremptory challenges entirely.”133 Despite Justice Marshall’s misgivings, the Court has relied on Batson to craft its later limitations on peremptory strikes.134  In its expansion of Batson, the Court has also significantly altered the framework designed in the 1986 decision.135 3.   The Supreme Court’s Expansion of Batson Beyond Its Original Purpose Since Batson was decided in 1986, the Court has imposed more expansive limitations on the exercise of peremptory challenges.136  Batson’s holding was originally limited to the discriminatory peremptory challenges exercised by prosecutors in criminal cases where the juror was the same race as the defendant.137  Since its decision in Batson, the Supreme Court has extended its rationale far beyond those original bounds.138 Powers v.

Essentially, criminal defendants were afforded “third-party standing”142 to challenge a violation of a juror’s equal protection rights.143 The Supreme Court further broadened Batson’s application in the years following Powers.144  Until 1991, the Supreme Court had only considered whether the discriminatory peremptory strikes of a prosecutor, a recognized state actor, violated the Equal Protection Clause.145  In Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,146 by contrast, the Court considered whether litigants in civil cases could exercise discriminatory peremptory challenges.147  First, the Court concluded that the selection of jurors serves an important function of the government and attorneys act with substantial assistance of the court.148  Furthermore, should civil veniremen be subjected to discrimination, “[t]he injury to excluded jurors would be the direct result of governmental delegation and participation.”149  Thus, during voir dire proceedings, the exercise of peremptory challenges is “pursuant to a course of state action.”150  The Court further reasoned that, regardless of whether a trial is criminal or civil, a challenged juror’s equal protection rights are violated when they are peremptorily dismissed based on race.151   140. Id. at 413 (stating that “a criminal defendant suffers real injury when the prosecutor excludes jurors . . . on account of race”).  141. Id. at 406.  142. See id. at 410. The Court engaged in a three-part analysis to determine whether a criminal defendant could be afforded third-party standing on behalf of a juror. See id. at 410–11.  It found that voir dire proceedings permit a party to establish a very close relationship, “if not a bond of trust,” with the veniremen. Id. at 413.  It also found that this relationship is maintained throughout the trial and, in some cases, through sentencing. Id.  Furthermore, the congruent interest criminal defendants and jurors have in “eliminating racial discrimination from the courtroom,” according to the Court, makes it “necessary and appropriate” for the defendant to have third-party standing.  Id. at 413–14.  Lastly, the Court determined that, while improperly excluded jurors have a right to bring suit on their own behalf, these challenges would necessarily be rare. See id. at 414.  Coupled with the financial burden at trial and the likely small financial stake, jurors would rarely, if ever, bring such action. See id.  143. Id. at 416.  144. See Georgia v.

McCollum,153 relying heavily on its analysis in Edmonson, the Court considered whether criminal defendants were permitted to peremptorily strike jurors based on race.154  The Court predictably concluded that criminal defendants were state actors subject to the same limitations as prosecutors and civil litigants under the Equal Protection Clause.155  Accordingly, the Court further broadened Batson’s scope and reaffirmed its post-Swain commitment to protecting jurors from discrimination, stating, “‘if race stereotypes are the price for acceptance of a jury panel as fair,’ we reaffirm today that such a ‘price is too high to meet the standard of the Constitution.’”156 The Court’s final expansion of Batson occurred in J.E.B. v. Alabama,157 when it prohibited peremptory challenges based on gender.158  The respondent in J.E.B. used nine of her ten peremptory challenges to exclude men from the venire, resulting in an exclusively female jury.159  The petitioner challenged the use of these strikes as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.160  Outlining the history of discrimination against women in the United States, the Court reasoned that “the Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender, or on the assumption that an individual will be biased in a particular case for no reason other than the fact that the person happens to be a woman or happens to be a man.”161  The Court further elaborated that similar to race the guarantee of the Equal Protection Clause, “ensuring citizens that their State will not discriminate,” would be meaningless if the Court were to permit gender-based peremptory exclusion.162 4.

Entirely eliminating the first requirement of the prima facie case defined in  152. Id.  153. 505 U.S. 42 (1992).  The Court considered four questions: First, whether a criminal defendant’s exercise of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner inflicts the harms addressed by Batson.  Second, whether the exercise of peremptory challenges by a criminal defendant constitutes state action.  Third, whether prosecutors have standing to raise this constitutional challenge.  And fourth, whether the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant nonetheless preclude the extension of our precedents to this case. Id. at 48.  154. Id. at 44.  155. Id. at 59.  156.

An explanation is not neutral if it is based on an assumption that members of a particular race or gender are likely to hold certain views or be biased in a certain way.168  Moreover, a “legitimate reason” for a peremptory challenge is not one that simply makes logical sense.169  Rather, it is one that does not deny equal protection guarantees.170  In fact, this second step is concerned only with the “facial validity” of a party’s explanation.171  Thus, any justification will be deemed neutral unless “a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor’s explanation.”172 The third and final step of a Batson inquiry requires the trial court to evaluate the plausibility and “persuasiveness of the prosecutor’s justification for his peremptory strike.”173  The very point of a peremptory strike is that a party’s motivation for the challenge remains unspoken.174   163.

Our survey reveals that in a broad array of cases . . . attorneys articulate and judges accept “race-neutral” explanations for peremptory strikes that either highly correlate with race or are silly, trivial, or irrelevant to the case.  Reviewing courts then affirm these determinations.  This is significant because if attorneys can avoid Batson in this manner, there are only two narrow circumstances in which a Batson challenge is likely to succeed:  (1) where an attorney admits to a racial motivation and (2) where an attorney’s explanation applies to a virtually identical juror of a different race who was not stricken. . . .

Drawing the Line:  The Fate of Peremptory Strikes in the Wake of Supreme Court Equal Protection Jurisprudence In J.E.B. v. Alabama, after expanding Batson a final time, the Supreme Court iterated that its holding did not “imply the elimination of all peremptory challenges.”180  It clearly explained that parties can exercise peremptory challenges to remove any “group or class of individuals normally subject to ‘rational basis’ review”181 under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.  With this, the Court drew a line in the sand.  A Batson challenge cannot be sustained unless the juror stricken from the venire is a member of a class entitled to something more than “rational basis review.”182  Part I.C.1. defines rational basis review and discusses the Supreme Court’s three-tiered system of judicial review.  Part I.C.2. examines how the Court determines whether a classification is entitled to more than mere rational basis review. 1.   The Three-Tiered System of Judicial Review Under the Fourteenth Amendment Ordinarily, a classification is constitutional if it passes rational basis review,183 the most lenient form of judicial review.184  A court will consider a law subject to rational basis review with a “presumption of constitutionality,” and uphold it if the challenged law is “rationally related”  175.

In other words, the assumption in those situations is that the legislature should not be in the business of passing laws that treat these groups differently than others.190 Intermediate scrutiny, at issue in J.E.B., is the middle tier of judicial review applied in cases involving quasi-suspect classifications.191  In order for a classification to be sustained under intermediate scrutiny, the law must further an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest.192 The most rigorous strict scrutiny standard is applied in cases involving suspect classifications such as race.193  To pass strict scrutiny, the legislature must have passed the law to further a “compelling governmental interest,” and must have narrowly crafted the rule to achieve that goal.194  A court applies strict scrutiny if the government significantly abridges a fundamental right with the law’s enactment or passes a law that involves a suspect classification.195  Suspect classifications include race, national origin, and alienage.196 Under the heightened scrutiny standards, “a tenable justification must describe actual stated purposes, not rationalizations for actions in fact differently grounded.”197  Stated differently, a state actor cannot defend a classification based on the “hypothetical justifications” welcomed under rational basis review.198  Accordingly, in most equal protection analyses, the “primary, and often determinative, question” concerns the level of scrutiny to be applied and whether the classification involved should be treated as suspect or non-suspect.199  185.

Defining Suspect and Quasi-Suspect Classifications In the 1970s and 1980s, the Supreme Court developed a test for determining whether a particular group is entitled to the application of heightened scrutiny.200  This test contemplates four factors.201  First, it considers whether the group in question has suffered a history of discrimination.202  Second, it inquires as to whether the group-defining characteristic has any relation to an individual’s ability to perform or contribute to society.203  Third, it considers whether the group exhibits “obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group.”204  Last, the test accounts for whether the group is a numerical minority or politically powerless.205 When applying this test, there is no single factor that is dispositive.206  Any one of the four factors may signal to the court that a classification, “provides no sensible ground for differential treatment”207 or is “more likely than others to reflect deep-seated prejudice rather than legislative rationality in pursuit of some legitimate objective.”208  The Court has given particular consideration to whether a group has been subjected to a history of discrimination, as well as whether the distinguishable characteristics of a group bear any relation to its ability to perform or contribute to society.209 II.   THE CIRCUIT SPLIT:  DOES THE BATSON REGIME PROHIBIT OR PERMIT SEXUAL ORIENTATION–BASED PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES? When the Supreme Court decided J.E.B., it made very clear that the expansion of Batson’s reach was not intended to entirely abdicate the peremptory challenge’s effect.210  In order for this intention to be practicable, it was necessary to draw a line in the sand.  At the time, the Court decided that this line would be drawn based on the level of judicial review the Court would apply when reviewing different classifications under the Fourteenth Amendment.211  Therefore, whether a peremptory challenge based on sexual orientation is eligible for Batson protection depends entirely on the level of scrutiny a court applies on review.212  200.

See id.  2018 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 Part II of this Note discusses the federal circuit courts’ diverse treatment of classifications based on sexual orientation and the resulting circuit split regarding the eligibility of jurors to receive Batson protection against peremptory challenges motivated by sexual orientation.  Part II.A examines three Supreme Court cases reviewing the constitutionality of classifications based on sexual orientation.  Part II.B analyzes the position that heightened scrutiny is applied to classifications based on sexual orientation, and therefore, Batson may be extended to prohibit peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation.  In contrast, Part II.C dissects the opposite position that classifications based on sexual orientation are entitled only to rational basis review, and thus, peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation remain permissible. A.   The Supreme Court’s Review of Classifications Based on Sexual Orientation Under the Fourteenth Amendment The Supreme Court has decided three cases concerning classifications based on sexual orientation which involved, at least in part, an analysis under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause:  Romer v. Evans,213 Lawrence v. Texas,214 and Windsor v. United States.215  The current circuit split, regarding which level of scrutiny must be applied when reviewing classifications based on sexual orientation, largely is based on how these cases have been, and are being, interpreted.216 1.   Romer v. Evans In its 1996 decision in Romer, the Supreme Court first addressed sexual orientation discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.217  In this case, the Court reviewed the constitutionality of an amendment to the Colorado Constitution, which prohibited all legislative, executive, and judicial action designed to protect homosexuals.218  The Court specifically articulated its application of rational basis review219 and explained the  213. 517 U.S. 620 (1996).  214. 539 U.S. 558 (2003).  215. Windsor v. United States (Windsor III), 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013).  216. See, e.g., SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471, 480, 484 (9th Cir. 2014) (interpreting Windsor III to indicate homosexuals are entitled to heightened scrutiny).  But see, e.g., DeBoer v. Snyder, 772 F.3d 388, 414 (6th Cir. 2014) (interpreting Windsor III as a decision about federalism, not heightened scrutiny).  217. The Supreme Court previously reviewed sexual orientation discrimination under the Due Process Clause in Bowers v. Hardwick. See 478 U.S. 186 (1986).  In that case, respondent challenged the constitutionality of a Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy. See id. at 187–88.  The Court found that there was no fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy as such a right was not “‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’ such that ‘neither liberty nor justice would exist if [it] were sacrificed.’” Id. at 191–92 (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 326 (1937)).  218. Romer, 517 U.S. at 623.  This amendment was passed in response to several Colorado municipalities’ prohibition of sexual orientation discrimination in realms of public and private housing, employment, education, public accommodations, and health and welfare services. Id.  219. Id. at 631–32.  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2019 deferential test:  “In the ordinary case, a law will be sustained if it can be said to advance a legitimate government interest, even if the law seems unwise or works to the disadvantage of a particular group, or if the rationale for it seems tenuous.”220  The Court found that Amendment 2 “confound[ed]” even this deferential standard for two reasons.221 First, the Court explained, Amendment 2 denied “equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense.”222  It imposed a “broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group”223 and was, simultaneously, “too narrow and too broad.”224  It was a type of legislation simply not supported by “our constitutional tradition,” making it more difficult for a specific group to obtain help from its government.225 Second, the Court concluded that Colorado did not have a legitimate interest in enacting Amendment 2.226  The Court not only rejected the state’s proffered interests,227 but also determined that the harm Amendment 2 inflicted on homosexuals “outr[an] and belie[d]” any legitimate interest that could justify its enactment.228  The Court, instead, succumbed to the “inevitable inference,” that the law was motivated by animus toward homosexuals,229 and concluded that Amendment 2 did not further a legitimate end but rather sought to make homosexuals unequal to everyone else.230  Notably, the Court did not address whether homosexuals constituted a quasi-suspect or suspect class.231 2.   Lawrence v. Texas Seven years after Romer, the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutional legitimacy of a Texas statute criminalizing homosexual sodomy in Lawrence.232  While it ultimately struck down the statute under the Due Process Clause, the Court superficially reviewed its legitimacy under the Equal Protection Clause.233  The majority concluded that, while Romer potentially provided a basis for striking down the statute under the Equal  220.

Hardwick.234 In her concurring opinion, however, Justice O’Connor explicitly found the Texas statute unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.235  She did so applying a “more searching form of rational basis review” that was justified by the statute’s “desire to harm a politically unpopular group.”236  Rearticulating the principles set forth in Romer, she stated, “[m]oral disapproval of this group, like a bare desire to harm the group, is an interest that is insufficient to satisfy rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause.”237 3.   Windsor III Most recently, the Supreme Court reviewed a Second Circuit decision238 striking down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act239 (DOMA).  The plaintiff, Edith Windsor, married her wife in Canada and subsequently resided in New York.240  Upon her wife’s death, Windsor was denied the benefit of a spousal deduction of federal estate taxes because DOMA’s definitions of “marriage” and “spouse” precluded the Internal Revenue Service from “recognizing Windsor as a spouse or the [same-sex] couple as married.”241  The Court concluded that since DOMA sought to injure the “very class New York [sought] to protect,” it violated both due process and equal protection principles.242  In doing so, however, the Court neither articulated the standard of review it was applying,243 nor, as in Romer,244 did it address whether homosexuals constituted a quasi-suspect or suspect class.245  234.

Ct. at 2706 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2021 The Court paid much attention to DOMA’s purpose and effect.246  It determined that DOMA’s “unusual deviation” from the practice of recognizing state definitions of marriage was “strong evidence” that the purpose and effect of the law was to “impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States.”247  Moreover, the Court reasoned that DOMA’s “operation in practice” further evidenced this purpose.248 Ultimately, the Court concluded that DOMA was invalid under the Fifth Amendment.249  It held that no legitimate purpose “[overcame] the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity.”250 B.   A New Quasi-Suspect Class: Batson May Prohibit Sexual Orientation–Based Strikes The Second and Ninth Circuits have decided that classifications based on sexual orientation require the application of heightened scrutiny.  Part II.B.1 assesses cases holding that heightened scrutiny applies when reviewing laws that classify based on sexual orientation.  Part II.B.2 discusses the possibility of prohibiting peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation in circuits where such classifications are reviewed with heightened scrutiny, and the Ninth Circuit’s express decision to do so. 1.   Homosexuals Are a Quasi-Suspect Class Entitled to Heightened Scrutiny In 2012, the Second Circuit became the first circuit to hold that heightened scrutiny applies to classifications based on sexual orientation.  In 2014, the Ninth Circuit followed suit.  246. Id. at 2693–94 (majority opinion).  247. Id. at 2693.  The Court indicated that Congress’s stated purpose was to promote “an interest in protecting the traditional moral teachings reflected in heterosexual-only marriage laws.” Id.  Furthermore, the Court adopted the argument that the Act’s demonstrated purpose was to “ensure that if any State decides to recognize same-sex marriages, those unions will be treated as second-class marriages for the purposes of federal law.” Id. at 2693–94.  “DOMA writes inequality into the entire United States Code.” Id. at 2694.  “DOMA’s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal.  The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency.  Responsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person.” Id.  248. Id.  249.

Id. at 2696.  2022 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 a.   The Second Circuit Applies Heightened Scrutiny to Review the Defense of Marriage Act:  Windsor II In its 2012 case, Windsor II,251 the Second Circuit considered whether a review of the constitutionality of Section Three of DOMA necessitated the application of heightened scrutiny.252 The Second Circuit first recognized that several courts have read Supreme Court precedent as demanding the application of a more searching rational basis review when there are “historic patterns of disadvantage suffered by the group adversely affected by the statute.”253  It further stated, however, that the Supreme Court has never “expressly sanctioned” such modification of the rational basis standard.254  Accepting that there is sufficient “doctrinal instability in this area,” the Second Circuit avoided deciding which level of rational basis need be applied, as “if heightened scrutiny is available” no “permutation of rational basis review is needed.”255 The court employed the Supreme Court’s four-factor suspect class inquiry256 and concluded that its review of Section Three of DOMA necessitated the application of heightened scrutiny.257  In applying this test, the court identified two of the four factors as merely “indicative” and not determinative of a group’s suspect class status.258  First, the court doubted whether there was “much left of the immutability theory.”259  It cited to the Supreme Court’s decision in Nyquist v. Mauclet,260 which rejected the argument that classifications based on alienage did not necessitate the application of strict scrutiny because alienage is not an immutable characteristic.261  Second, it recognized that the political powerlessness of a group was relevant, but neither necessary (“as the gender cases demonstrate”) nor sufficient (“as the example of minors illustrates,”262) to establish a suspect class.263  Nevertheless, despite the limited importance of these two factors, the Second Circuit determined that all four of the test’s factors justified the application of heightened scrutiny.264 The court began with an “easy” conclusion that homosexuals have suffered a history of discrimination, a fact which was “not much in  251. 699 F.3d 169 (2d Cir. 2012).  252.

The Ninth Circuit’s Decision to Apply Heightened Scrutiny to Classifications Based on Sexual Orientation:  SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories The Ninth Circuit, in Smithkline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories,285 specifically considered whether peremptory strikes could be exercised on the basis of sexual orientation.286  In the lower court, the plaintiff brought an action alleging that the manufacturer of an HIV drug violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and antitrust laws.287  During voir dire, the defendant used its first peremptory challenge to remove the only self-identified gay juror from the venire.288  The plaintiff responded with a Batson challenge, alleging that the defendant’s peremptory strike was motivated by the juror’s sexual orientation.289  The trial judge rejected the Batson challenge, expressing doubt as to whether  278.

Id.  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2025 Batson applied to sexual orientation–based peremptory challenges, and the plaintiff subsequently appealed.290 The Ninth Circuit, relying on the line drawn in J.E.B., reasoned that, if sexual orientation is a classification subject only to rational basis review, the lower court’s decision to reject the Batson challenge was unreviewable.291  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit began by considering whether classifications based on sexual orientation are entitled to heightened scrutiny.292 In making its determination, the court posited that, since the Supreme Court failed to articulate the standard of review it applied in Windsor III, it was necessary to review what the court “actually did.”293  Three aspects of the Supreme Court’s Windsor III analysis persuaded the Ninth Circuit that it engaged in heightened scrutiny.294 First, the Supreme Court did not entertain possible post hoc rationalizations for the enactment of Section Three of DOMA.295  Traditionally, laws survive rational basis review “if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify” the classifications imposed by the law.296  In Windsor III, the Ninth Circuit explained, the Supreme Court did not “[conceive] of hypothetical justifications for [DOMA].”297  Nor did the Court consider any of the five rational bases offered by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group in its brief.298  Instead, the Court relied on DOMA’s legislative history to evaluate the “essence” of the law and considered its “design, purpose, and effect.”299  Moreover, the Court extensively discussed Congress’s “avowed purpose . . . to impose inequality,” as well as DOMA’s “demonstrated purpose” to support its conclusion that Section Three of DOMA was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.300  This consideration of Congress’s actual purpose and the failure to consider hypothetical rational bases, according to the Ninth Circuit, “is antithetical to the very concept of rational basis review.”301  290.

Id.  2026 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 Second, the Supreme Court deemed Congress’s interest in enacting Section Three legitimate.302  More than that, however, the Court demanded that this legitimate purpose “justify disparate treatment of the group.”303  Were the Court applying rational basis review, the Ninth Circuit concluded, it would not have identified a legitimate interest in order to “justify” the classification.304  Rational basis, contrastingly, is “unconcerned with the inequality that results from the challenged state action.”305  Yet Windsor III repeatedly refers to the harm, injury, and effect of DOMA on gays and lesbians, concluding that no purpose “overcomes” this effect.306  Moreover, the majority was concerned with the “public message sent by DOMA about the status occupied by gays and lesbians in our society,” which tends to impose second-class status on the group.307 Absent among all of this concern was the “strong presumption” of constitutionality and the “extremely deferential posture” typical of rational basis review.308  Windsor III’s thorough consideration of DOMA’s actual purpose, the harm and injury DOMA inflicted on homosexuals, as well as its balancing of the two, according to the Ninth Circuit, simply do not comport with traditional rational basis review.309 Lastly, the Ninth Circuit considered what it described as “the least important factor”:  whether Windsor III cited and relied upon cases employing heightened scrutiny.310  While the relevant portion of the Windsor III opinion relies on few cases,311 the Ninth Circuit found that the Court relied both on rational basis and heightened scrutiny cases.312  Thus, while the Court’s reliance was not decisive, it tended to support the application of heightened scrutiny.313 Thus, applying the Witt test, the Ninth Circuit concluded that Windsor III compelled the application of heightened scrutiny in equal protection cases involving classifications based on sexual orientation.314  This  302.

Heightened Scrutiny:  Necessary But Not Sufficient to Extend Batson  The Ninth Circuit pointed out that “[i]n J.E.B., the Supreme Court did not state definitively whether heightened scrutiny is sufficient to warrant Batson’s protection or merely necessary.”316  Instead, the Court stated, “parties may . . . exercise their peremptory challenges to remove from the venire any group or class of individuals normally subject to ‘rational basis’ review.”317 Analyzing the reasoning and rationale of J.E.B., the Ninth Circuit prohibited peremptory challenges based on sexual orientation.318  The court pointed out that J.E.B. “took Batson, a case about the use of race in jury selection, and applied its principles to discrimination against women.”319  In doing so, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, the Supreme Court recognized that even groups with a history of discrimination significantly differing from that of African Americans, may be entitled to the protection of Batson.320  Accordingly, the Court’s articulated purposes in deciding J.E.B. and Batson were applied, and the history of discrimination experienced by gays and lesbians independently analyzed, to justify the Ninth Circuit’s prohibition of sexual orientation–based peremptory strikes.321 First, the Ninth Circuit recognized that, much like strikes on the basis of race and gender, peremptory challenges exercised on the basis of sexual orientation deprive individuals of the right to participate in the judicial system “on account of a characteristic that has nothing to do with their fitness to serve.”322  While homosexuals have not been systematically excluded from juries in the same open manner as women and African Americans, the “unique experiences of gays and lesbians,” and the history of government-endorsed discrimination against them, compel the same Batson protection.323  Certainly, homosexuality is not a characteristic  315.

In the first half of the twentieth century, public attention was preoccupied with homosexual “infiltration” of the federal government.  Gays and lesbians were dismissed from civilian employment in the federal government at a rate of sixty per month.  Discrimination in employment was not limited to the federal government; local and state governments also excluded homosexuals, and professional licensing boards often revoked licenses on account of homosexuality.  In 1985, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in a case in which a woman had been fired from her job as a guidance counselor in a public school because of her sexuality.  Indeed, gays and lesbians were thought to be so contrary to our conception of citizenship that they were made inadmissible under a provision of our immigration laws that required the Immigration and Naturalization Service  2028 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 obvious on the face of a juror.324  Until quite recently,325 however, gays and lesbians did not identify themselves as such for fear that “being openly gay [would result] in significant discrimination.”326  Second, the Ninth Circuit stated that the Constitution cannot perpetuate the very “state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice” that lead to this forced privacy in the first place.327  For all of these reasons, the Ninth Circuit determined that peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation must be prohibited under Batson.328 In the Second Circuit, after Windsor II, homosexuals are no longer a group “normally subject to rational basis review.”329  As such, under J.E.B. they are not a group that automatically can be peremptorily removed from the venire in courts where Windsor II is binding.330  While this suggests that sexual orientation-based strikes may be prohibited in the Second Circuit, the court has not yet decided the issue. While the Second and Ninth Circuits are the only two circuit courts to define homosexuals as a class entitled to heightened scrutiny, several district courts have decided similarly since then.331  Several circuits and district courts, however, have also declined to do so.332 C.   Homosexuals Are Not Entitled to Heightened Scrutiny or Batson Protection As the Second Circuit pointed out in Windsor II, there is much “doctrinal instability” surrounding the issue of the appropriate standard of review to be applied to classifications based on sexual orientation.333  Only the Second and Ninth Circuits have expressly decided that homosexuals constitute a (INS) to exclude individuals “afflicted with psychopathic personality.”  It was not until 1990 that the INS ceased to interpret that category as including gays and lesbians.  It is only recently that gay men and women gained the right to be open about their sexuality in the course of their military service.  As one scholar put it, throughout the twentieth century, gays and lesbians were the “anticitizen.” Id. at 484–85.  324. See id. at 485.  325.

Part II.C.1 examines interpretations of Supreme Court precedent inapposite to the Second and Ninth Circuits’ view, that sexual orientation–based classifications are entitled to mere rational basis review.  Part II.C.2 discusses the ineligibility, under J.E.B., of sexual orientation–based peremptory strikes to be prohibited in jurisdictions adopting this view and the arguments against extending Batson to prohibit such strikes. 1.   Sexual Orientation–Based Classifications Are Reviewed for Rational Basis:  DeBoer v. Snyder The Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of Windsor III, and the opinion that the Supreme Court in its actions, rather than its words, has been applying heightened scrutiny to sexual orientation–based classifications, is certainly not a unanimous one.  The Sixth Circuit’s recent interpretation of rational basis review, as applied to the prohibition of same-sex marriage precipitated by the Michigan Marriage Amendment (MMA) in DeBoer v. Snyder,335 is an appropriate example of just that. DeBoer reviewed the constitutionality of the voter-approved MMA, which prohibited same-sex marriage.336  The court addressed the question from many different perspectives, considering arguments for and against the MMA’s validity under theories of “rational basis review; animus; . . . [and] suspect classificatio[n],” among others.337  Under no theory, however, did the court find a reason for “constitutionalizing the definition of marriage and for removing the issue from the place it has been since the Founding:  in the hands of state voters.”338 a.   Rational Basis Review The Sixth Circuit began its rational basis analysis by defining the deference to be effected when applying this standard of review, stating, “[s]o long as judges can conceive of some ‘plausible’ reason for the law—any plausible reason, even one that did not motivate the legislators who enacted it—the law must stand, no matter how unfair, unjust, or unwise the judges may consider it as citizens.”339  Ultimately, the court found two such bases sufficient to meet this “low bar,”340 the first of which is the furtherance of a government interest in regulating sex341 and in creating  334.

(“One starts from the premise that governments got into the business of defining marriage, and remain in the business of defining marriage, not to regulate love but to  2030 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 stable family units for the creation of children.342  The court viewed the MMA as a state-created incentive for a couple to “stay together for purposes of rearing offspring.”343  It also held that this legislation is not irrational, but rather, recognizes the “biological reality” that same-sex couples do not have children in the same way that heterosexual couples do.344  The same risk of unintended offspring, therefore, does not exist.345 In recognizing this basis, the court also considered a countervailing policy argument in favor of extending marriage laws to gay couples: gay couples are no less capable than straight couples of sharing loving, affectionate, and committed relationships or of raising children and providing stable families for them.346  Ultimately, however, the court stated that the “signature feature” of rational basis review is that legislation will not be invalidated simply because the government has done too much or too little in addressing a policy question.347  Moreover, rational basis review does not “empower federal courts to ‘subject’ legislative line-drawing to ‘courtroom’ factfinding” which tends to favor a different policy.348  Nor can such found facts be the basis of a ruling of unconstitutionality.349 The second rational basis the Sixth Circuit recognized was a state’s right to “wait and see” before legislating inapposite to traditional societal norms.350  While the plaintiffs argued that the state has acted irrationally in its continued adoption of the traditional definition of marriage “in the face of changing social mores,” the court disagreed.351  Eleven years after Massachusetts recognized gay marriage, “the clock has not run on assessing the benefits and burdens of expanding the definition of marriage.”352  Moreover, the court decided, the question of whether maintaining the traditional definition of marriage is worth its cost is one for the legislature, not “life-tenured judges.”353  To further this point, the court concluded its rational basis analysis by rearticulating its undertaking, stating, “[o]ur task under the Supreme Court’s precedents is to decide whether the law has regulate sex, most especially the intended and unintended effects of male-female intercourse.  Imagine a society without marriage.  It does not take long to envision problems that might result from an absence of rules about how to handle the natural effects of male-female intercourse:  children.”).  342.

Animus Next, the Sixth Circuit explained the very lack of “traditional deference” present in cases like Romer and Lawrence and relied upon by the Ninth Circuit in SmithKline.355  It posited that the cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down state laws under rational basis review are those in which “the novelty of the law and the targeting of a single group for disfavored treatment” are apparent.356  Distinguishing this case from cases like Romer and Cleburne, the court pointed out that this law was not novel.357  In fact, it codified “a long-existing, widely held social norm already reflected in state law.”358  Moreover, quoting Windsor III, the court pointed out that the heterosexual nature of traditional marriage “had been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition of that term and to its role and function throughout the history of civilization.”359 Further distinguishing this case from other Supreme Court precedents, the court indicated that Michigan’s decision to define marriage in its constitution was not unusual and lacked the “kind of malice or unthinking prejudice the Constitution prohibits.”360  The decisions in Cleburne and Romer, the Sixth Circuit posited, turned on whether “anything but prejudice to the affected class could explain the law.”361  The Court, in those cases, decided that there were none.  Here, the Sixth Circuit concluded, plenty of alternative explanations existed.362 c.   Quasi-Suspect Class Next, the Sixth Circuit considered whether the Supreme Court’s four-part test deemed homosexuals a quasi-suspect class necessitating the application of heightened scrutiny.363  In opposition to both the Ninth and Second Circuits’ analyses and considering only two of the four factors, the court found that homosexuals do not constitute a quasi-suspect class under this test.364  354.

See id. at 413–16.  2032 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 The argument that homosexuals are a quasi-suspect class faced two “impediments”:  the first, the Sixth Circuit’s own precedent indicating that rational basis review applies to sexual orientation classifications,365 and the second, the fact that the Supreme Court has never held that sexual orientation classifications should receive heightened review and “has not recognized a new suspect class in more than four decades.”366 First, the Sixth Circuit recognized that homosexuals have suffered a “lamentable” history of discrimination.367  It also pointed out, however, that the traditional definition of marriage being challenged in this case developed “independently of this record of discrimination.”368  Second, the Sixth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit in concluding that homosexuals as a group are not so politically powerless that “extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process” is required.369  Instead, the court reasoned that since gay marriage was legalized in Massachusetts eleven years ago, homosexuals have enjoyed “nearly as many successes as defeats and a widely held assumption that the future holds more promise than the past.”370  As such, the court concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment is not designed to protect a group from the reality of democratic initiatives, “some succeed, some fail.”371  Accordingly, under the Sixth Circuit’s analysis, homosexuals do not constitute a quasi-suspect class.372 d.

Other Circuits Hold That Sexual Orientation–Based Strikes Are Permissible Only the Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have specifically considered whether peremptory challenges based on sexual orientation are eligible for prohibition under J.E.B.380  Both the Eighth and Eleventh Circuits neglected to extend Batson to prohibit sexual orientation–based peremptory challenges. a.   Sexual Orientation–Based Strikes Are Permissible Unless the Supreme Court Holds Otherwise First, all circuits which apply rational basis review to classifications based on sexual orientation are precluded from extending Batson to prohibit peremptory strikes on the basis of sexual orientation.381  J.E.B. explicitly permits peremptory strikes based on a characteristic defining a group entitled to rational basis review.382  Accordingly, in the Sixth Circuit, and other circuits applying rational basis review, sexual orientation–based peremptory challenges are necessarily permissible.  Unsurprisingly, the Eleventh and Eighth Circuits declined to extend Batson when they had the opportunity, due primarily to the Supreme Court’s failure to do so. Prior to the Ninth Circuit’s decision in SmithKline, the Eighth Circuit chose not to extend Batson in United States v. Blaylock.383  Not electing to  374. Id.  375. Id. at 414.  376.

Florida Department of Corrections,385 the Eleventh Circuit dismissed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on an attorney’s failure to object to a peremptory strike of a homosexual juror, stating, “the Supreme Court has never held that homosexuality is a protected class for purposes of analyzing discrimination in jury selection under Batson.”386 Moreover, since the Ninth Circuit’s decision in SmithKline, several district courts have declined to adopt its rationale for want of binding precedent.  In Geiger v. Kitzhaber,387 the District Court of Oregon refused to consider SmithKline binding precedent.388  It reasoned that at least one judge of the Ninth Circuit made a sua sponte call for a rehearing en banc.389  Thus, no mandate issued from the case and it is not yet a final and binding decision.390  While the court recognized that it could independently reach the same conclusion as the SmithKline court, it ultimately determined that was not necessary in this case.391 b.   Batson Should Not Be Extended to Prohibit Peremptory Strikes Based on Sexual Orientation Even if the Sixth Circuit’s view is rejected, and homosexuals are deemed a quasi-suspect class, it must be independently considered whether Batson should be expanded to prohibit sexual orientation–based peremptory strikes.  This section will discuss the view, often appearing in dissenting or concurring opinions, that Batson’s principles should not be applied to prohibit peremptory strikes based on any characteristics other than race. In Justice O’Connor’s concurrence in J.E.B., she warned of the potential costs the Court’s extension to gender might have on the value of the peremptory challenge.392  The peremptory challenge’s purpose is to enable parties to impanel fair and impartial juries.393  “[B]y enabling each side to exclude those jurors it believes will be most partial toward the other,” extreme biases for one party or another are eliminated from the venire.394  The very nature of a peremptory strike—that it is exercised without a stated  384.

If asked whether the racial or gender composition of a jury might have anything to do with its eventual verdict, most Americans would probably agree that it does.  The assumption underlying this opinion is that men and women, blacks and whites, the rich and the poor, may see the world in very different ways and that jurors’ differing world views may color their impressions of a case so much so that different jurors may reach different decisions about a just verdict.

Yet there are equally crippling costs and meaningful benefits to maintaining the status quo.  It now must be considered whether, in the Batson realm, we can have our cake and eat it too. III.   BATSON’S HOLDING SHOULD BE BOTH NARROWED AND EXPANDED Any proposed change to the Batson regime must consider the two constitutional rights affected by it:  a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and a juror’s Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the laws.412  When Batson was decided, the Supreme Court seemingly turned its focus away from maintaining a powerful peremptory strike and prioritized the safeguard of jurors’ equal protection rights.  This Note attempts to preserve that priority but also revitalize the power of the peremptory challenge. Part III.A delves into the inconsistencies plaguing the Batson regime, exploring the limits J.E.B. places on Batson and the flaws of J.E.B.’s limiting principle.

The Batson Regime’s Plague:  Inconsistency There are two reasons the current Batson framework is ineffective.  First, the stated and apparent purposes of Batson and its progeny are inconsistent with Batson’s scope.  While Batson’s rationale can seemingly be employed to protect jurors from discrimination based on characteristics other than race and gender, J.E.B. greatly hinders that possibility.413  Second, Batson rigidly applies standards of judicial review in a way that creates a constitutional legal fiction.  Under this application, as a matter of constitutional law, race and gender never have a relevant impact on a juror’s ability to be impartial, whereas a juror’s sexual orientation always does.414 1.   The Batson Regime’s Purpose Seeks to Protect More Groups than J.E.B.’s Limiting Principle Would Allow When Batson was decided, both its holding and its purpose were very focused.415  The Supreme Court sought only to eradicate the racially discriminatory exercise of peremptory strikes by prosecutors.416  This focus preserved the value of the peremptory strike and strictly limited Batson’s application.417  As Batson’s application and purpose have been expanded, and that focus diluted, a limiting principle was necessary to maintain the utility of the peremptory challenge.418 In J.E.B., the Court articulated the needed limiting principle.419  While peremptory strikes based on race and gender were prohibited, parties could still exercise peremptory challenges against any group “normally subject to ‘rational basis’ review.”420  This section discusses why Batson’s broadly understood purpose cannot be reconciled with J.E.B.’s explicit allowance of discriminatory peremptory strikes against certain groups. a.   Batson and J.E.B.:  The Reason Peremptory Strikes Based on Race and Gender Are Prohibited In both Batson and J.E.B., the Supreme Court offered several rationales for its limitations on the exercise of peremptory challenges.  First, when deciding Batson, the Court largely relied on the principles set forth in Strauder, indicating that the purposeful discrimination employed during jury selection violated a defendant’s Equal Protection rights.421  Elaborating further, the Court specified that the state unconstitutionally discriminated  413.

See supra note 111 and accompanying text.  2038 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 against excluded jurors by relying on race to assess their competence.422  “A person’s race,” the Court explained, “simply ‘is unrelated to his fitness as a juror.’”423  Moreover, the Court concluded that the injuries precipitated by purposeful discrimination extended beyond the courtroom to undermine the public’s confidence in the “fairness of our system of justice.”424 In J.E.B., the Supreme Court responded to several arguments that Batson’s rationale could not be applied to justify the prohibition of gender-based peremptory challenges.425  Analogizing, the Court ultimately held that, like race, gender “is an unconstitutional proxy for juror competence and impartiality.”426  In concluding so, the Court cited the history of discrimination against women in the United States, deciding that in order to expand Batson, the Court need not determine . . . whether women or racial minorities have suffered more at the hands of discriminatory state actors during the decades of our Nation’s history.  It is necessary only to acknowledge that “our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination” . . . .427 Moreover, J.E.B.’s holding, extending Batson to prohibit gender-based strikes, implies that narrowly viewing Batson’s purpose as specific to race is untenable.  The Court reasoned broadly that, “[W]hether the trial is criminal or civil, potential jurors, as well as litigants, have an equal protection right to jury selection procedures that are free from state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice.”428  The Court recognized that veniremen “have the right not to be excluded summarily because of discriminatory and stereotypical presumptions that reflect and reinforce patterns of historical discrimination.”429  In making these broad statements, the Court left a serious question unanswered:  Why only race and gender? b.   Inconsistencies Between the Court’s Limiting Principle and its Reasoning Batson’s rationale, especially as it has been more recently interpreted in J.E.B., can seemingly be employed to justify the prohibition of peremptory strikes based on other cognizable group characteristics.  The Supreme Court explicitly hindered courts from doing so, however, when it articulated J.E.B.’s limiting principle. Admittedly, the need for such a limiting principle is quite impressive.  Peremptory strikes serve several important functions, not the least of which,  422. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 86 (1986).  423. Id. at 87 (quoting Thiel v. S. Pac. Co., 328 U.S. 217, 227 (1946)).  424. See supra note 115 and accompanying text.  425. J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 129, 136.  426. Id. at 129.  427. Id. at 136; see supra note 161 and accompanying text.  428.

Id. at 141–42.  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2039 is its status as an important procedural safeguard of a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury.430  The further limited the exercise of peremptory challenges becomes, the less able defendants are to protect that right.431  The issue is not at all that a limiting principle exists, but rather that the chosen limiting principle quite seriously fails to serve Batson’s purposes. Consider that the groups Batson protects are not uniquely vulnerable to discrimination, whereas, at least one group to which J.E.B. denies this protection, is vulnerable.  Currently, Batson and J.E.B. protect two groups that, historically, have been rather immune to discrimination:  whites and men.432  In Batson, the Supreme Court assessed the constitutionality of peremptory strikes excluding blacks from a jury.433  It held more broadly, however, that “race” could not motivate a strike.434  This protects whites from discrimination during voir dire as much as it protects blacks.435  Similarly, and quite strangely, J.E.B. cited the history of discrimination against women to justify its conclusion that the respondent’s gender-based strikes against men were unconstitutional.436  Yet, in all but two circuits, the level of judicial scrutiny applied to classifications based on sexual orientation renders the history of discrimination against homosexuals irrelevant to justify Batson’s extension.437 c.   Sexual Orientation:  An Example of the Inconsistency Sexual orientation is an obvious illustration of the incongruence of Batson’s rationales and J.E.B.’s limiting principle.  While J.E.B. prevents Batson from being applied to prohibit sexual orientation–based peremptory strikes in all but two circuits, Batson and J.E.B.’s rationales effortlessly justify their prohibition.  When deciding whether to prohibit peremptory strikes based on race and gender, the Court considered several issues.  These include:  (1) whether a characteristic is related to one’s fitness as a juror, (2) whether discrimination against a group “undermines” the public’s confidence in the justice system, and (3) whether the group defined by the characteristic has historically experienced discrimination.438  Consider these factors as applied to sexual orientation. First, sexual orientation, like race and gender, is entirely unrelated to a juror’s ability to impartially evaluate a case.439  One need not be an expert of any kind to realize that sexual orientation is not a characteristic having any effect on one’s intelligence, ability to listen, reason, or apply the law to  430.

Not only is this issue “not much in debate,” but a majority of cases which have “meaningfully considered” the question so hold.440 Second, as the Court stated in J.E.B., jurors have a right not to be “summarily” dismissed based on assumptions which tend to reinforce historical prejudice.441  Such an allowance would send a message to the public that certain individuals are “presumed unqualified by state actors to decide important questions.”442  In fact, it seems certain that permitting citizens to be dismissed from juries based solely on their sexual orientation, or any characteristic not affecting their fitness as a juror, perpetuates this appearance of unfairness, and results in a “loss of confidence” in the judicial system.443 Third, as recognized by the Second Circuit in Windsor II, homosexuals have endured government-sponsored discrimination since, at least, the 1920s.444  Yet, despite the simplicity with which these factors justify the prohibition of sexual orientation–based peremptory challenges, J.E.B.’s limiting principle remains an obstacle.445  This obstacle is caused, principally, by its rigid application of the three-tiered system of judicial review.446 2.  J.E.B.’s Limiting Principle Rigidly Applies Standards of Judicial Review in a Way That Fails to Consider the Factual Circumstances of Each Case J.E.B. rigidly utilizes the three-tiered system of judicial review applied in all Equal Protection cases to control Batson’s expansion.447  This section discusses how J.E.B.’s flawed limiting principle creates a legal fiction whereby race and gender are never constitutionally relevant to a juror’s ability to be impartial, and sexual orientation is always relevant.  It also demonstrates the ways in which this limiting principle is inconsistent with the spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment. No matter the basis of a discriminatory peremptory strike, or the level of judicial scrutiny applied to review it, the exerciser of a peremptory strike has the same compelling, important, or legitimate interest.448  This interest is in safeguarding a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury.449  After Batson, regardless of the factual circumstances of a case, a race-conscious peremptory strike will never survive strict scrutiny as a narrowly tailored means of furthering this compelling interest.450  Likewise, after J.E.B., gender-based explanations will never be thought to  440.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2041 further this important interest under intermediate scrutiny.451  Both of these principles are supported by explanation and reasoning.452  J.E.B.’s limiting principle, on the other hand, was articulated without any justification. J.E.B.’s allowance of discriminatory peremptory strikes against some groups suggests that peremptory challenges based on characteristics defining groups entitled to rational basis review are always deemed rationally related to furthering the state’s legitimate interest.453  This, seemingly, cannot be true.  In light of the fact that sexual orientation does not bear on a juror’s fitness to serve, how can a sexual orientation–based strike rationally further the interest of impanelling an impartial jury, in say, an arson case?  In SmithKline, there was, at the very least, a rational stereotype-based argument that a homosexual juror may be biased against a company affecting the cost of HIV medication, considering the gay community’s historical relationship with the disease.454  In an arson case, by contrast, no similar rationality exists.  A homosexual juror seemingly would be no more or less likely to be partial than a heterosexual juror.  Yet, under Batson, sexual orientation is a permissible basis for peremptory dismissal in all but the Ninth Circuit.455 Moreover, as Justice O’Connor articulates in her J.E.B. concurrence, this system fails to consider that race, gender, and other similar characteristics matter.456  Studies have shown that, in certain types of cases, one’s race, gender, and other characteristics truly do affect whether one votes to convict or not.457  Even without empirical studies, one need not be racist, sexist, or homophobic to infer that such defining characteristics would greatly impact, for example, a juror’s evaluation of an alleged hate crime against a member of a group to which the juror also belongs.458 Simply stated, it is quite contradictory to say that, on the one hand, “jurors are not expected to come into the jury box and leave behind all that their human experience has taught them,”459 and, on the other hand, preclude litigants from considering the effects of human experience resulting from one’s race or gender.460  Justice O’Connor posited that this application of the three-tiered system of judicial review has created a legal fiction.461  As a matter of constitutional law, she stated, race and gender are never relevant when exercising peremptory strikes.462  This Note expands on that idea.  Not only are race and gender never relevant, but under the current Batson regime, sexual orientation is always relevant.  451. See generally J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 143.  452.

Id.  2042 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 Justice Scalia further illuminated the flaws of the Batson regime in his J.E.B. dissent, where he discussed the irrationality of the majority’s limiting principle.463  To him, it seemed as though there was no reason to conclude that a stereotype-motivated peremptory strike furthered a government interest only if the stereotyped person happens to be a member of a group entitled to mere rational basis review.464 Justice Scalia’s discussion of the limiting principle highlights yet another inconsistency plaguing the Batson regime.  While Batson and J.E.B. expressly prohibit court-sponsored discrimination, J.E.B. also expressly sanctions it.  It forces one to consider whether the Equal Protection Clause is more faithfully served by the pre-Batson regime where all groups are subject to discriminatory peremptory strikes (as Justice Scalia argues) or the current regime where some groups are and others are not?465 Further exasperating the unequal protection afforded certain groups under Batson is the current circuit split facilitated by J.E.B.’s limiting principle.  The principle forces a court seeking to end court-sponsored discrimination of homosexuals first, independently to prove (as the Ninth and Second Circuits have) that homosexuals are entitled to heightened scrutiny.466  Some courts, however, have simultaneously expressed the opinion that homosexuals should be entitled to heightened scrutiny and refused to apply the standard absent the Supreme Court’s endorsement.467  Other courts have argued that heightened scrutiny should not be applied.468  This is quite problematic. First, under the Supreme Court’s own four-part test, homosexuals seemingly constitute a quasi-suspect class.469  Second, for years, even absent the prerequisite quasi-suspect status, the Supreme Court has been applying a standard of review more rigorous than traditional rational basis to classifications involving homosexuals.470  The Supreme Court’s reluctance to define homosexuality as a suspect class is steadfast, however.  Most recently, in Windsor III, the Supreme Court neither stated which level of scrutiny it was applying nor engaged in an analysis even resembling traditional rational basis review.471  Moreover, as Justice Scalia points out in his dissent, “The opinion does not resolve and indeed does not even mention what had been the central question in [the] litigation:  whether, under the Equal Protection Clause, laws restricting marriage to a man and a woman are reviewed for more than mere rationality.”472  As a result of the  463.

But the Court certainly does not apply anything that resembles that deferential framework.”).  472. Id.  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2043 Court’s avoidance of this issue, lower courts choosing to wait for the Supreme Court to define sexual orientation as a quasi-suspect class are stuck endorsing discrimination of homosexuals based on historically informed stereotypes, until the Court decides to address the question.473 In sum, the problem precipitated by J.E.B.’s limiting principle is that a group that seemingly deserves Batson’s protection is entitled to such in only the Ninth Circuit and eligible for it in just one other.474  This “conflict of authority” is eerily similar to the one the Court meant to solve by granting certiorari in J.E.B.475 B.   How Batson’s Holding Should Be Both Narrowed and Expanded While the stated criticisms of the Batson regime motivate this Note to suggest that Batson should be applied to prohibit sexual orientation–based peremptory strikes, as in the Ninth Circuit, it also recognizes that this would impermissibly burden a defendant’s ability to protect his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury.  For this reason, this Note suggests, not only that Batson be expanded but also that its holding be narrowed to re-empower the peremptory strike. 1.   Proposed Limiting Principle First, this Note suggests that Batson’s protection should be afforded to groups defined by immutable characteristics that do not affect one’s competence as a juror.  Whereas the group a juror freely associates with may lead to logical inferences regarding their opinions and biases, immutable characteristics are not usually as informative.  Moreover, generalizations made on the basis of immutable characteristics are very often rooted in historical stereotypes.  The groups we freely associate with, on the other hand, provide factual bases for such group generalizations. This limiting principle would solve two problems.  First, by expanding Batson’s application to more groups, J.E.B. would no longer prevent Batson from prohibiting purposeful discrimination.  Second, by decoupling Batson from the three-tiered system of judicial review even those courts which apply rational basis review to sexual orientation classifications would be able to prohibit sexual orientation–based classifications. 2.   Narrowing Batson’s Scope To compensate for the proposed expansion’s hindrance on a defendant’s ability to protect his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury, Batson’s first step should be altered.  This Note proposes that a prima facie case of intentional discrimination be established in only two circumstances.  473. See supra Part II.B.2.  474. See supra Part II.B.1.  475. J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 130 (1994) (“We granted certiorari to resolve a question that has created a conflict of authority—whether the Equal Protection Clause forbids peremptory challenges on the basis of gender as well as on the basis of race.”).  2044 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 83 First, a prima facie case of discrimination must be found where a pattern of peremptory strikes indicates that a group is being systematically excluded from the jury.  Succinctly justifying this prohibition, Justice Marshall stated, “[i]t is not necessary to assume that the excluded group will consistently vote as a class in order to conclude, as we do, that its exclusion deprives the jury of a perspective on human events that may have unsuspected importance in any case that may be presented.”476 Second, a prima facie case of discrimination must also be found where (1) very convincing evidence of discrimination exists and (2) proving a “pattern” of strikes against a certain group is impossible because only one member of that group is present on the venire.  Such a system would necessarily allow a prima facie case to be found in a situation similar to that in SmithKline, where the only self-identified homosexual member of the venire was peremptorily stricken.477  The relationship of the gay community to HIV, along with counsel’s failure to ask any questions regarding other bases of exclusion, leads to the permissible inference, sufficient to establish a prima facie case, that his peremptory strike may have been motivated by the juror’s sexual orientation.478  While perhaps over-inclusive, this principle ensures that discrimination against a numerical minority on the venire does not go unchecked, and that a fair cross-section of the community may potentially include its minority members. By making it more difficult to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, it allows peremptory strikes to be exercised with more discretion.479  In doing so, it may be that a peremptory strike exercised on the hunch that a person’s race, gender, sexual orientation, et cetera has rendered him or her biased.  And admittedly, isolated instances of such would be unchallengeable.  Yet it is not certain or even probable that the number of discriminatory peremptory strikes detected by the court will be affected.  Without the strong systematic exclusion or pretext evidence this Note would require, it is likely the Court will accept any plausible reason for a strike, regardless of its truth or relevance.480 Furthermore, this cost is certainly balanced by the benefit of extending Batson’s protection to several historically discriminated against groups that are not currently eligible for it.  In providing this protection, this resolution also re-empowers the peremptory strike by making an effective challenge less common and thereby restores some of the practice’s discretionary nature. CONCLUSION Consider again the example presented in the Introduction of this Note.  When a Batson challenge was made following the peremptory strike of a  476. Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493, 503–04 (1972).  477. See supra Introduction.  478. See supra Introduction.  479. See supra note 398 and accompanying text.  480. See supra note 172 and accompanying text.  2015] NARROWING AND EXPANDING BATSON 2045 suspected homosexual from the venire, the judge replied, “Well, I don’t know . . . whether Batson ever applies to sexual orientation.”481  In so stating, this judge expressed doubt whether court-sponsored discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is permissible.  The answer to that question should clearly be:  “No.” Batson and subsequent cases flaunt the ideal that discrimination against jurors will not be tolerated, and yet it is.  It may be that voir dire proceedings are not effectively designed to render the reliance on “group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice” unnecessary.482  It may be that discrimination is an unfortunate means to a necessary end.  While the solution this Note proposes does not claim to solve all of these problems, it does solve one. In J.E.B., the Court, quoting Strauder, derisively described the allowance of peremptory strikes based on gender as “practically a brand upon [women], affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority.”483  Extending Batson to prohibit the exercise of peremptory strikes based on a juror’s sexual orientation, at the very least, eliminates this “brand” on the gay community.  481.

    "abstract": "Since the U.S. Supreme Court began limiting the exercise of peremptory  challenges to safeguard potential jurors from discrimination, it has faced a  nearly impossible task. The Court has attempted to safeguard a juror’s  equal protection rights without eradicating the peremptory challenge’s  ability to preserve a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury. Under  the current legal framework, it is not certain whether either constitutional  right is adequately protected. This Note examines the history of the  Supreme Court’s limitation on peremptory challenges. It then discusses the  current federal circuit split over whether peremptory challenges should be  further limited. Finally, this Note concludes that the existing framework’s  application should be extended and restricted to more effectively protect the  constitutional rights at issue",
