(2009)  Challenging homophobic bullying in schools: the politics of progress – International Journal of Law in Context 7(2), pp. 181-207 Challenging homophobic bullying in schools:the politics of progressDaniel MonkSchool of Law, Birkbeck, University of London1AbstractIn recent years homophobic bullying has received increased attention from NGOs, academics andgovernment sources and concern about the issue crosses traditional moral and political divisions.This article examines this ‘progressive’ development and identifies the ‘conditions of possibility’ thathave enabled the issue to become a harm that can be spoken of. In doing so it questions whether thereadiness to speak about the issue represents the opposite to prohibitions on speech (such as thenotorious Section 28) or whether it is based on more subtle forms of governance. It argues thathomophobic bullying is heard through three key discourses (‘child abuse’, ‘the child victim’ and ‘thetragic gay’) and that, while enabling an acknowledgement of certain harms, they simultaneouslysilence other needs and experiences. It then moves to explore the aspirational and ‘liberatory’political investments that underlie these seemingly ‘common-sense’ descriptive discourses andconcludes with a critique of the quasi-criminal responses that the dominant political agenda ofhomophobic bullying gives rise to. The article draws on, and endeavours to develop a conversationbetween, critical engagements with the contemporary politics of both childhood and sexuality.IntroductionHomophobic bullying has become a legitimate object of social concern within civil society. In recentyears it has been explicitly addressed not only by numerous non-governmental children’s rightsand sexual health organisations2 but also by government policy and guidance documents3 and,albeit not explicitly, in statutory provisions.4 It is also an issue that crosses political andtraditional moral divides as supportive expressions of concern have been made not just by theLiberal Democrats and the Labour Party5 but also by the Conservative Party (2008, p. 9) and1 Earlier versions of this article were presented at a seminar convened by the Birkbeck Institute of Gender andSexuality and the Thomas Coram Institute, Institute of Education (April 2008) and at the Socio-Legal StudiesConference (De Montfort University, 2009) and the European Sociological Association Conference (Lisbon,2009). I am grateful to the participants for their insightful comments. Special thanks are also due toProfessor Leslie Moran and Helen Reece for their encouragement and detailed and constructive commentson earlier drafts.2 See, for example, Blake and Plant (2005), Save the Children (2008), CRAE (2009), Terence Higgins Trust (2009),Claridge (2008).3 DfES (2002), DfES (2003a; 2003b), DCSF/Stonewall (2007), DCSF (2009). See also: <www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/behaviour/tacklingbullying/homophobicbullying/> (last visited 18 November 2010).4 The Schools Standards and Frameworks Act 1998, Section 61 (now section 98 of the Education andInspections Act 2006) refers to ‘encouraging good behaviour and respect for others on the part of pupilsand, in particular, preventing all forms of bullying among pupils’ as factors to be taken into account byhead teachers and governing bodies in designing and implementing discipline policies. As homophobicbullying is referred to explicitly in guidance documents relating to bullying, it can consequently be arguedthat the statutory references can also be interpreted to include this form of bullying.5 The 2010 general election manifestos of both the Liberal Democrats (2010, pp. 35, 73) and the Labour Party(2010, Chapter 3:5) made explicit references to tackling homophobic bullying.International Journal of Law in Context, 7,2 pp. 181–207 (2011) Cambridge University Pressdoi:10.1017/S1744552311000061religious bodies6 (Catholic Education Service, 2007; Church of England, 2010) – organisations withlittle (or a relatively short) history of sympathy to lesbian and gay issues. It was also deemedsignificant enough to warrant an explicit reference in the current government’s CoalitionAgreement.7The mainstreaming of the issue, the fact that the concern is expressed as an unproblematic‘common-sense’ good, represents a success for lesbian and gay rights organisations – in particularStonewall – for whom the issue has been a key plank in campaigns relating to young people(Hunt and Jensen/Stonewall, 2007). Moreover, the reliance by campaigners and policy-makers onthe extensive academic literature8 about the issue can be understood as a successful example ofresearch impact.9 For it could be argued that ‘evidence-based’ research has revealed a problem;that this knowledge has been widely and effectively disseminated; and that this has led to theintroduction of policies that will result in an improvement in the wellbeing of children’s lives.10The aim of this article is not to test this hypothesis. It does not attempt to demonstrate, either way,the potential impact on real children. Rather, the aim here is to examine the discursive means bywhich the issue has become perceived as a legitimate issue of concern; in other words, to identifythe ‘conditions of possibility’11 that have enabled homophobic bullying to become a harm that canbe spoken of.A key starting point for this line of enquiry is to think of ‘homophobic bullying’ not simply asa neutral descriptive label for factual incidents but as a more complex phenomenon. In otherwords, that the act of naming a wrong or a harm and the identification of perpetrators andvictims is a productive process that is contingent on a complex concatenation of culturaland political factors. This perspective serves to shift the focus away from the ‘homophobic bully’and instead towards the expressions of concern about homophobic bullying. In doing so it seeks toquestion whether the coupling of ‘youth’ and ‘homosexuality’ by the mainstreaming of thisconcern represents a ‘liberated’ and fearless break from traditional homophobic narratives ofseduction and abuse.12 And, in doing so, it questions whether the readiness to speak ofhomophobic bullying represents the opposite to prohibitions on speech (such as the notoriousSection 28 of the Local Government Act 200813) or whether it itself contains or relies on more6 Catholic Education Service statement re: Education & Skills Select Committee report on bullying (26 March2007). Statement issued in response to the House of Commons Education and Skills Committee Third Reportof Session 2006–07 on bullying: <www.cesew.org.uk/standardnews.asp?id = 52544> (last visited 18 November2010). Church of England (2010) Frequently Asked Questions: ‘Do CoE schools encourage homophobia?’</www.cofe.anglican.org/info/education/faqcofeschools/#homophobia> (last visited 18 November 2010).7 The agreement states that: ‘we will help schools tackle bullying in schools, especially homophobic bullying’(HM Government, 2010, p. 29).8 See, for example, D’Augelli, Hershberger and Pilkington (2001), Ellis and High (2004), Hunter (2008), Molloyand McLaren (2004), Phoenix, Frosh and Pattman (2003), Rivers (2001a; 2001b), Rivers and Duncan (2002),Rivers and Noret (2008), Trotter (2006), Warwick, Goodrich, Aggleton and Chase (2006), Watkins,Mauthner, Hewitt, Epstein and Leonard (2007).9 Indeed, the fact that there is much literature about homophobic bullying but almost no critical engagementwith the agenda itself serves to reinforce the unquestioned nature of its premises. A notable exception is Ellis(2007).10 This account, moreover, fits well within an academic context where demonstrable ‘impact’ has become acriteria for the evaluation of research.11 The notion of ‘conditions of possibility’ refers here to Michel Foucault’s understanding of discursiveframeworks of knowledge as those grounded in and made possible by a particular historical epoch(Foucault, 1980).12 Weeks (1985, p. 224).13 Section 28, which prohibited the ‘promotion’ of homosexuality by local authorities, was repealed on 21 June2000 in Scotland, and on 18 November 2003 in the rest of the UK by the Local Government Act 2003 s 122.182 daniel monksubtle and implicit heteronormative14 assumptions and premises. In asking these questions, thisproject draws on a shift in focus from scholars of the politics of sexuality who, like Stychin forexample, suggest that it is ‘time to turn the glare of analysis away from the conservatives andtowards the reformers’ (2003, p. 26).15It is important to make clear from the outset that asking critical questions about homophobicbullying, placing it in a broader political and cultural context, and thinking about it primarily as adiscourse as opposed to simply a harm, does not suggest that the real-life experiences of youngpeople are being taken in any way less seriously. Nor is it to suggest that demands forintervention and both national and local action are necessarily misguided. On the contrary,enquiring into the speakability of homophobic bullying raises the question as to what happens andwhat is enabled when this discourse becomes the key plank for challenging homophobia in schools.Bravmann argues that a problematic, but dominant, trope in many gay and lesbian politicalnarratives, in particular historical accounts, is that:‘a politics of visibility is an adequate and self-explanatory form of resistance to the very processesthat construct the “invisibility” these projects aim to counter.’ (1997, p. 128)16In exploring the unquestioned progress of visibility (and speakability) this project is one that takesseriously the injunction from the feminist legal scholars Diduck and Kaganas that:‘While giving a voice to any previously disempowered ormarginalized constituency is important,and listening to children is long overdue, we must be alert to the discourses through which thatvoice is heard and interpreted.’ (2004, p. 981)Homophobic bullying is heard through a concatenation of numerous discourses and this article doesnot claim to be comprehensive. It starts by identifying three key discourses: ‘child abuse’, ‘the childvictim’ and the ‘tragic gay’. It then moves to explore the aspirational political investments thatunderlie these seemingly descriptive discourses and concludes with an examination of the quasi-criminal responses that the dominant political agenda of homophobic bullying gives rise to. Indoing so, the article draws on and endeavours to bring together critical understandings of thepolitics of both childhood and sexuality.‘Child abuse’Homophobic bullying, however defined, is not new. Consequently, it is possible to talk of the recentconcern as representing a ‘discovery’ and in this respect there are informative parallels to be drawn14 For a definition of this complex but frequently used concept see Berlant and Warner: ‘the institutions,structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make heterosexuality seem not only coherent —that is, organized as a sexuality — but also privileged. Its coherence is always provisional, and its privilegecan take several (sometimes contradictory) forms: unmarked, as the basic idiom of the personal and thesocial; or marked as a natural state; or projected as an ideal or moral accomplishment. It consists less ofnorms that could be summarized as a body of doctrine than of a sense of rightness produced incontradictory manifestations . . . One of the most conspicuous differences is that it has no parallel, unlikeheterosexuality, which organizes homosexuality as its opposite. Because homosexuality can never have theinvisible, tacit, society founding rightness that heterosexuality has, it would not be possible to speak of“homonormativity” in the same sense’ (1998, p. 548).15 See also Brown (1995).16 See also Reilly (2007).challenging homophobic bullying in schools 183with earlier ‘discoveries’ such as domestic violence and child abuse. Two distinct points will be madehere. The first explores the contingency of the ‘discovery’ of harms and the second the contingency ofthe notion of harm itself.The notion of ‘discovery’ refers to the significance of the political context within which feminist,children’s rights and lesbian and gay activists and campaigners have enabled harms to be spoken ofand understood as social ills that demand public action (Parton, 1985, Part One). In this way, itrepresents a shift in awareness of a violence and relations with that violence. The ‘discovery’ ofdomestic violence and child abuse both effectively challenged the idealised representation of thefamily as the ‘haven in the heartless world’. In a similar fashion, homophobic bullying challengesthe idea that the ‘school years are the best years of your life’. The latter proverbial truism wasarguably always more an adult reflection on adult life and an instruction to children, but in bothcases these crude statements reflected ideological myths that legitimised silences in order toreinforce cultural norms.Whereas the reluctance to acknowledge the dangers in the home served to uphold an ideologicalinvestment in a patriarchal norm of the family, the reluctance to acknowledge homophobic bullying,and indeed bullying in general, can be seen to reflect the investment in schooling per se as a site ofproduction of a particular norm of childhood17. Finch reminds us that ‘there are very goodreasons for doubting whether any type of educational provision can be regarded as solely andunambiguously for the benefit of its recipients’ (1984, p. 85), and in the nineteenth century thereconstruction of children from workers to pupils was not always embraced by children or theirparents (Hendrick, 1997, pp. 39–42, 45–47). But the silence and collective amnesia about thisattests to the extent to which the school has become perceived, like the family, in universalahistorical terms as an almost ‘natural’ a priori institution.18 That this perception has at timesbeen complicit with the silencing of speaking of the harms within the school is clear from theinfluential child psychologist John Bowlby’s explanation of the causes of school phobia. In 1973,he stated with confident authority that:‘there is widespread agreement that what a child fears is not what will happen at school, butleaving home . . . almost all the students of the problem conclude that the disagreeablefeatures of school, for example a strict teacher or teasing or bullying from other children, arelittle more than rationalizations.’ (1978 [1973], p. 301, emphasis added)This statement seems strikingly at odds with the current speakability of homophobic bullying, andbullying generally, within schools. But whereas there has been a clear shift in relation to the school,the impact of parental homophobia on children, which is arguably at least as, if not more, significant,remains an issue that is not addressed by organisations like Stonewall and children’s rightsorganisations. And the fact that the ability for public concern about the effects of homophobiacan be entertained in the school but not the home attests to the fact that the speakability ofconcern is contingent on its location.19 In other words, in seeking to explain why homophobia inthe school space has become open to widespread political criticism, it is necessary to look beyonda concern about the wellbeing of children.17 As Walkerdine comments, ‘it was generally agreed’ that it ‘brought about the idea of childhood as somethingseparate’ (2009, p. 113).18 This is particularly evident in the work of the child psychologists Donald Winnicott and John Bowlby, forwhom the child’s initial journey to the ‘the school’ is invested with the a priori naturalness akin to achild’s journey to ‘the mother’ or ‘the father’; see Monk (2004).19 There are clear parallels here with legal challenges to physical chastisement which similarly continue todistinguish between the home and the school; see Fortin (2009, pp. 329–34).184 daniel monkTaking a long view here is informative. For whereas the dominant postwar child psychologists’masking of child harms within schools cohered with political and social shifts unrelated tochildren’s needs (Finch, 1984, p. 85; Monk, 2004), so too does the new-found ability to dootherwise. While it is important to avoid simplistic causal explanations, it is possible to see thenew concern, if not enabled, at least not unconnected to broader political and socioeconomicshifts in the perception of schooling. In particular, the increased questioning of the public interestin education and its reinscription as a private rather than a public good (Kymlicka, 1999; Chitty,2009), the political construction of parents no longer as passive recipients but as consumerssupported by the rhetoric of choice (Harris, 2007), increases in home education as a legitimateoption and, more broadly, the cultural impact of the phenomenon of school shootings (Warnick,Johnson and Rocha, 2010), have all in different ways rendered the school potentially dangerous,open to question and at odds with the earlier constructions of it as an unquestionable and naturalgood. Significantly, they serve too to explain the dichotomy referred to above between thespeakability of homophobia within the school and the home, for these broader shifts in manyrespects have served to reinscribe the home and parental child relations as safer places. Albeit thatthe changing perceptions of the parental role in education, while enhanced within politicaldiscourses, do not in any way represent a straightforward increase in parental autonomy or rights(Monk, 2009).Extent and definition are key issues in the literature about homophobic bullying and here tooimportant parallels can be drawn with domestic violence and child abuse. For surveillance andthe accumulation of knowledge of a subject are a crucial part of the process of ‘discovery’; they donot construct a problem but, rather, reflect already problematised issues. As Hunter argues in thecontext of the history of education:‘the role of social statistics is not so much to represent reality as to problematize it, to call intoquestion, to hold it up for inspection in the light of what it might be, to picture itsreconstruction around certain norms of life and social well being – norms derived of coursefrom the social, economic and political objectives of government.’ (1996, p. 154)In this vein, when Archard asks the question, ‘Can child abuse be defined?’, he acknowledges theextent to which attempts to do so are never in any way neutral exercises but inherently politicaland social. Archard acknowledges Gough’s concern that, ‘at worst an over intellectual questioningof the meaning of abuse implies that abuse does not really exist’ (1996, p. 13, quoted in Archard,1999, p. 75) but he concludes that:‘the increasing versatility of the concept of child abuse – its ability to pick out more and moretypes of wrong done to children – has only been purchased at the cost of its increasingvacuity, its lack of any distinctive content possessing clear evaluative connotations.’ (1999, p. 88)This concern is critical when reading the literature about homophobic bullying. The campaigns byStonewall refer to homophobic bullying as being ‘endemic in schools’ and cite statistics that 65–98per cent of pupils experience it at one time or another (Hunt and Jensen/Stonewall, 2007, p. 3).20 Yetthese statistics are based on an extremely broad definition of homophobic bullying. One that20 The language used here to describe the extent – ‘endemic’ – is also significant. Moran, in the context ofhomophobic hate crime, argues that ‘the exceptional is figured in the suggestion that this violencerepresents a crisis and an epidemic. Epidemic stands for novelty. This is not so much the novelty of theappearance of homophobic violence, but the novelty of its characterization as disorder and the novelty ofan awareness of the scale of this violence’ (2004, p. 935).challenging homophobic bullying in schools 185stretches from, at one end of the spectrum, extreme repeated systematic violence, to, at the otherend, overhearing the word ‘gay’ being used in a pejorative way, being socially excluded andexperiencing a sense of being different. Significantly, the empirical literature which is cited tosupport these statistics, while not downplaying the significance of homophobic bullying, also citescomparative studies with very different results and, as explored below, is more cautious aboutcausal claims made as to the effect of homophobic bullying (Rivers, 2001a; Warwick et al., 2006).This selective statistical representation coheres with and appeals to the broader cultural shiftswithin which schooling itself is increasingly perceived as a dangerous space. More particularly, itattests to the extent to which the homophobic bullying agenda utilises and is spoken of throughthe dominant image of childhood as vulnerable and one premised on the status of the child asinnocent victim.‘The child victim’Empirical research about homophobic bullying frequently identifies causal links betweenhomophobic bullying and alcoholism, suicide, low school attendance and a variety of emotionaldisorders (Rivers, 2001a; Warwick et al., 2006). Mirroring in this way the literature on child abuse,it enables homophobic bullying to be included discursively within this ever-expanding category.This is strategically important, for under the label of child abuse, homophobic bullying isrepresented as an unquestioned wrong, a legitimate and, crucially, a depoliticised harm and onetherefore able to garner widespread sympathy (Parton, 1985, Part Two).One of the reasons why this discursive categorising of homophobic bullying achieves this statusis because it draws on familiar images of the child as innocent victim. And these images reassure asmuch as they appal. As Patricia Holland has argued:‘Without an image of an unhappy child the concept of childhood would be incomplete. Real children sufferin many different ways and for many different reasons, but pictures of sorrowing childrenreinforce the defining characteristics of childhood – dependence and powerlessness. Patheticimages of children create a desired image in which childhood is no longer a threat and adults are backin control.’ (2004, p. 143, emphasis added)This perspective represents a provocative challenge to the work of certain aspects of children’s rightsagendas and it is not unreasonable to question why, strategically, it matters. In other words, if theeffects of homophobic bullying are suffering and unhappiness and emphasising this interpretationof the literature in campaigns brings the issue to a wider audience, why should this be an issue ofconcern? A key argument here is that it matters because enabling the speakability of homophobicbullying through the imagery of the child as victim renders silent other concerns.The most notable silence is about sex. One of the most striking aspects of the homophobicbullying agenda is the extent to which it speaks of lesbian and gay youth through a desexualiseddiscourse. For example, the Stonewall website page that addresses school issues is dominated byhomophobic bullying but has no mention of young people’s needs for information about safer sexand education about HIV.21 Similarly, the Conservative Party report More Ball Games (no punintended) supports tackling homophobic bullying, but in the broader context of a nostalgicsupport for children to play more sports (Conservative Party, 2008). As Ellis argues, the approachadopted here is ‘a plea for tolerance that doesn’t speak about what is to be tolerated’ (2007, p. 23).2221 See <www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/> (last visited 18 November 2010).22 See also Ingham (2005).186 daniel monkWhile challenging homophobia in schools and providing information about HIV are arguablydistinct, this does not explain the silence. Both bullying and access to information about HIV canbe understood as basic human and children’s rights (Harris, 2005; Veerman, Talsa, Druzin andWeinstein, 1999; Packer, 2000). And the harm suffered by the absence of the latter is arguably assignificant as the former, if not more so, as recent UK statistics about HIV infections indicate thatgay teenagers are increasingly the most at-risk group.23 Consequently, the argument here is thatthe distinction between challenging bullying and providing information about HIV is not anobvious or neutral one, but rather one that is indicative of the extent to which the homophobicbullying agenda coheres with and is contingent on the ‘reassuring’ image of the brutalised child.For to speak of safer sex would require speaking of sexual agency, pleasure and choice, and indoing so would challenge the ideal of the child as ‘innocent’ and non-sexual (Stainton Rodgersand Stainton Rodgers, 1999; Waites, 2005). This silencing is not new, as Piper has observed, intracing the origins of the dominant norm of childhood sexual innocence and its relationship withthe development of welfare policies:‘There is a sense in which the price paid by children over the last 150 years for the presumedbenefits of child welfare legislation and provision has been their “de-sexing”.’ (2000, p. 40)24‘The tragic gay’While the child as victim resonates with dominant constructions of childhood, in the context ofhomophobic bullying there is a double victimhood. For what is striking from the research, inparticular from accounts of its effects, is the extent to which the image of the lesbian and gaychild mirrors the dominant image of the homosexual in 1950s popular discourses: depressed,lonely, isolated, suicidal (Rebellato, 1999; Cook, 2007). And while critical engagements with thediscourse of the child as victim demonstrate how that image reassures and reinscribes a social andcultural binary (in that case between adult and child), the gay victim also provides an image ofthe homosexual as a reassuringly distinct and tragic ‘other’ from that of the heterosexual.Victimhood as the basis of the call for tolerance enables religious groups to distinguish betweenprotecting the sinner and condemning the sin. And the extent to which conservative and religiousgroups’ recognition of homophobic bullying reflects a highly limited shift in thinking was clearwhen the Conservative Party and the majority of Bishops in the House of Lords successfullyopposed provisions in the Children, Families and Schools Bill 2010 to extend the provision of sexeducation in such a way that would have ensured that information about HIV and discussionsabout sexuality would have been more firmly embedded in the curriculum.25 Moreover, asQuinlivan argues, identifying lesbian and gay youth as at risk ‘allows them to be classified asfitting within a deviant model which argues that they “need help”’ (2002, p. 25).23 The National Aids Trust (NAT) notes that ‘There has been a worrying increase in diagnoses amongst younggay men’ <www.nat.org.uk/HIV-Facts/Most-affected-by-HIV/Gay-and-Bisexual-Men.aspx> (last visited 18November 2010); see also statistics from the Terence Higgins Trust (THT): <www.ygm.org.uk/home/professionals/sexhiv/> (last visited 18 November 2010).24 While policies introduced by New Labour acknowledged the reality of sexual activity amongst young people,it did so primarily to reduce teenage pregnancy and to advocate delay; see Monk (2001). Moreover, the LabourParty 2010 Manifesto stated that it would provide support for parents who wished to challenge ‘aggressive orsexualised commercial marketing’ and ‘ask Consumer Focus to develop a website for parents to register theirconcerns about sexualised products aimed at their children (2010, para. 6:3).25 Children, Families and Schools Bill 2010, clauses 13, 14. While the Bill was enacted Conservative oppositionensured that these provisions were dropped during the ‘wash-up’ period prior to the General Election.challenging homophobic bullying in schools 187Victimhood also has a reassuring role within lesbian and gay political discourses. Bravmann, indeveloping a critical queer historiography that disrupts a linear progressive narrative, quotesD’Emilio’s assertion that gay liberationists of the 1960s and 1970s constructed a mythology that‘until gay liberation, gay men and lesbians were always the victims of systematic, undifferentiated,terrible oppression’ (1983, p. 101, quoted in Bravmann, 1997, p. 26). This political move is reflectedin Stonewall’s representation of contemporary school life as overwhelmingly one of hardship andof bullying of ‘endemic’ proportions. But there is an unremarked tension here, for this veryrepresentation was criticised in recent research commissioned by Stonewall about young people’sresponses to images of gays and lesbians in the media; a key finding being that the representationsfocused too much on the negative aspects of gay lives – to the point of caricature – and failed topresent positive images (Stonewall, 2010).26 Once again the paradoxical uses of symbolicrepresentations indicates the contingency of narratives about young gays and lesbians.It is important to emphasise that the point here is not that real suffering does not exist but theextent to which the dominance of the tragic image is a condition of possibility for the speakability ofhomophobic bullying and the extent to which it effectively silences other voices and reduces theexperience of lesbian and gay young people to one of passive victimhood.27 The reality of youngpeople’s sexual activity is one such silence but others can be detected that relate to the causalclaims made about homophobic bullying.Ian Rivers, the leading empirical researcher in the area, whose work is relied on by Stonewall andcampaigning groups, recently argued that:‘despite the nature and severity of bullying participants experienced at school, many overcame itsuccessfully . . . [there was] little evidence of long-term anxiety or indeed insecurity withinintimate relationships . . . and that given some of the positive outcomes found, researchersshould begin to focus more intently upon coping strategies and resilience and seek todetermine why some former victims of bullying successfully negotiate adulthood while othersdo not.’ (Rivers and Cowie, 2006, p. 38)A similar point is made by Blackburn (2007) in relation to developments in the USA. What they bothsuggest is that much of the research in this area looks for harm and that the stories not only ofresilience but also of those who do not experience homophobic bullying are never mentioned bycampaigners.28 Two possible alternative narratives that give voice to more complex subjectpositions can be identified; first, through a rethinking of the causal linkage between homophobicbullying and educational attainment and, second, by exploring the concept of shame.Educational attainmentExisting research frequently identifies the gym and physical sports as the most uncomfortable andfeared space for lesbian and gay young people (Rivers, 2001a; 2001b; Rivers and Duncan, 2002;Warwick et al., 2006). But we are not directed towards thinking about the least feared space. Ifasked, it might be that the library would be identified as the safest place. If so, it might complicate26 Examples of typical statements by young people in this report are: ‘They never seem to be happy’ (William,aged 13, p. 7); ‘TV gives the wrong view of gay people because every storyline is about them being beaten upand discriminated against. They are never accepted by their family’ (Ishani, aged 16, p. 7).27 Indeed, it is in part a recognition of the problematic discursive power of ‘homosexual victimhood’ that,arguably, informs much of the recent queer historical scholarship that endeavours to complicate theseearlier dominant narratives of the past, see Bravmann (1997), Cook (2007), Houlbrook (2005).28 A similar point has been made in relation to the experiences of children post-divorce; see Smart, Neale andWade (2001). My thanks to Helen Reece for making this link.188 daniel monkthe dominance of ‘tragedy’ in the context of educational attainment. Much of the literature identifieslow educational achievements and school refusal (truancy) to be a result of bullying. The confidentstatements that homophobic bullying is ‘endemic’ could give the impression that lesbian and gayyouth are, consequently, particularly disadvantaged in education. But other statistics give asignificantly different impression. Research undertaken by SIGMA in 2008 found that theproportion of homosexually active men in post-compulsory education was higher than thenational average (Weatherburn, Hickson, Reid, Jessop and Hammond, 2008, para. 2.4).29 And, thisfinding is congruent with the data from the first National Survey of Sexual Attitudes, whichsuggested that homosexually active men had been in full-time education longer than other men(Johnson, Wadsworth, Wellings, Field and Bradshaw, 1994, p. 209). The aim here is not to set up acompeting claim to truth about the real educational attainments of lesbian and gay youth, norindeed to challenge the suggestion that there is a relationship between homophobic bullying andeducational attainments. An attempt to explore with any rigour the connections between sexualorientation and educational outcomes would need to address the complex intersections of genderand, most crucially in this context, socioeconomic background. Consequently, in introducing theother ‘evidence’ here, the aim is simply to complicate the representation of tragedy.Educational statistics that demonstrate that girls do better than boys in examinations are loudlyproclaimed on a seemingly annual basis. These statistics are, of course, crude, and mask complexsocial and political narratives (significantly there is never any mention of sexual orientation,which begs the question about the educational attainments of young lesbians).30 But it is theirpower to produce and signify a very particular and restricted notion of a ‘crisis in masculinity’that dominates (Collier, 2001). The statistics referred to above, that, equally crudely, could suggestthat gay men achieve better educational attainments than heterosexual men currently receive nosuch attention, and yet they too could problematise dominant masculinity.It is interesting to note that such a ‘conclusion’ would not be new, for, from the late nineteenthcentury, Americanmedical discourses routinely identified homosexuals as being intellectually giftedas a compensatory result of their homosexuality (Franklin, 2003). Again, the point here is not that thisapproach is in any way a more accurate picture; on the contrary, this medical model simplyreaffirmed a scientific belief in the unnaturalness and abnormality of homosexuals. The pointhere is that any attempt to speak of the educational attainment of a highly unheterogenous groupas an indicator for the experiences of that group demonstrates the extent to which the ‘facts’ areused to confirm rather than to inform a discursive construction. Consequently, the relative silenceabout alternative narratives of educational attainment are, it is suggested, not simply the result ofa lack of methodological rigour, but rather attest to an investment within contemporary lesbianand gay politics in the gay child as tragic victim.ShameThe concept of shame can also be utilised to complicate the dominant narrative of tragedy. Shame is acomplex concept that is understood in different ways across a number of disciplines (Probyn, 2005).In the context of homophobic bullying it has been identified as one of the detrimental effects(McDermott, Roen and Scourfield, 2008). McDermott et al. make the important point that shame/pride discourses establish a binary, which ‘appears to allow for only two subject positions: thesuccessful, proud-self who can cope with homophobia; and the failed, ashamed-self who is29 See also Weatherburn, Davies, Hickson and Hartley (1999).30 There is an extensive literature about this; see, for example, O’Flynn and Epstein (2005), Epstein, Maw, Elwoodand Hey (1998), Youdell (2005).challenging homophobic bullying in schools 189distressed by homophobia’ (p. 822).31 Excluding the possibility of shame and pride co-existing, orneither being present, this binary, ‘tends not to allow for more nuanced and complexmanoeuvring within these discourses to subject positions which may be proud in some spaces,but less so in other situations’ (p. 822). This is an important distinction that to some extent echoesRivers’s suggestion that responses to homophobic bullying are more complex than the ‘evidence’suggests. But the argument here raises a more fundamental question by suggesting that shame isnot simply a negative outcome, evidence of the harm caused by homophobic bullying, but a morecomplex emotion and sensation and, crucially for this argument, not one from which lesbian andgay childhood can, or necessarily should, be removed, overcome or liberated.This use of the concept of shame draws on the queer theoretical approach of Munt, who remindsus that ‘the foremost shame narrative ofWestern culture’ is The Fall of Adam and the expulsion fromEden and that:‘the ensuing rejection by God instigates Man’s individuation; his self-consciousness occurs becauseof his separation. This is the vacillation of subjection and individuation.’ (2007, p. 80)She argues that a proud, defiant sexuality is ‘premised on an uncomfortable historically discursiveshame’ and that:‘In any personal trajectory, the growing consciousness of same-sex desire must, in a Westerncontext, give rise to feelings of difference and exclusion . . . The presence of shame has beenrepressed in the discourse of homosexual rights in an unhelpful way, in order to gain greateragency, we must learn to revisit its ambivalent effects.’ (p. 95, emphasis added)The argument here is that attempts to remove, outlaw or silence shame-inducing practices throughexpansive definitions of homophobic bullying is an example of rights discourse overlooking theproductive role of shame. Definitions of homophobic bullying are broad, and the focus here is onthe lower end of activities. Name-calling, identifying oneself and being identified as different, andexperiencing difference as exclusion and as uncomfortable – these practices share much with theemotion of shame. The blush of recognition as different (whether or not self-identified as ‘gay’ or‘lesbian’) might sometimes be a painful sensation, but one that plays a role in identity formation.Silencing the speakability of this experience of shame as anything other than a form of violence,as abuse or harm, coheres both with the notion of the child as innocent victim and with a particularconstruction of ‘liberated’ gay identity, noted above, which is dependent on the uniformed oppressedpre-liberated representation. Moreover, it mirrors broader fears that underlie contemporary attemptsto construct childhood spaces as harm- and pain-free (Gill, 2007; Guldberg, 2009). This utopian desireis not surprising; as queer theorists Bruhm and Hurley argue, ‘Utopianism follows the child aroundlike a family pet’ (2004, p. xiii). But, in the context of ‘shame’, by way of stark contrast, the playgroundrepresents here a paradise, an Eden, pre-The Fall, pre-Shame: a space premised on welfaristunderstandings of protection but within which children are denied productive individuation,denied self-consciousness and the ‘blush of recognition’, and one that reinforces homogeneousness.A political agendaRevealing the contingent representations of lesbian and gay youth through which homophobicbullying is made speakable (and its silencing of alternative narratives) demonstrates how the31 The use of shame here resonates with the concept of internalised homophobia discussed below.190 daniel monkagenda is concerned not solely with addressing harms inflicted on children but is intimatelyinterlinked with broader political strategies and imaginations of the future. In the context ofhistorical scholarship, Bravmann argues that:‘we need to look at how images of the gay and lesbian past circulating among us animate thepresent and to read lesbian and gay historical self-representation as sites of ongoinghermeneutic and political struggle in the formation of new social subjects and new culturalpossibilities.’ (1997, p. 4)Reading contemporary debates about homophobic bullying as a ‘history of the present’, thisperspective can be applied here. Indeed, homophobic bullying is a particularly rich site for thisform of political meaning-making, located as it is at the intersection of discourses of educationand childhood. The perception of education as the key tool for unlocking individual potential andfor creating a fairer society remains an article of faith within liberal and progressive politicalparadigms (Finch, 1984; Hendrick, 2003), and the predominant social construction of childhood isone of ‘not-yets’, ‘becomings’, ‘empty vessels’, always to be understood as something in the futureand for the future of society as a whole (Jenks, 1996; Lee, 2001; James, Jenks and Prout, 1998).Research about homophobic bullying is inherently and inevitably a political project. Yet whileissues such as gay marriage and gays in the military are campaigns that have been exposed tolively critique within the LGBT community and academic literature, there has been very littlesimilar debate about homophobic bullying, located as it is within the ‘benign’ emancipatoryliberal discourses of education and future-focused discourses of innocent and universal childhood.In identifying and making visible the aspirational political implications, the focus here turns firstto imaginations and representations of a post-homophobic time, and second to an examination ofthe role that collective memory plays within advanced or post-liberal societies where therapeuticcorrectness functions as a key form of governance.The liberated gay?One way of exploring the broader political and emancipatory role of the homophobic bullyingagenda is by identifying exactly what homophobic bullying is understood to be the cause of.What this line of enquiry reveals is that while there has been a demonstrable shift in political andpublic attitudes, to the extent that it is now homophobia that is identified as the problem and nothomosexuality, at the same time there is in important respects no change as to what isproblematised, merely the cause. For, drawing implicitly on a child developmentalist model,homophobia takes on, with a twist, the psychoanalytical role formerly played by the Freudianconcept of ‘arrested development’. ‘Arrested development’ famously sought to explain what madea person homosexual. For lesbian and gay rights campaigners this very question is highlyproblematic, as the innateness of homosexuality is both an article of faith and strategicallyessential for human rights claims within a liberal political paradigm (a position explored bynumerous queer critiques). Yet the argument here is that ‘arrested development’ has not beenrejected but reformulated. Development into successful normal adulthood is not ‘arrested’ byparental or maternal attachment, but rather by homophobia itself. In other words, thedevelopmental question now is not, ‘What makes someone homosexual?’, but instead ‘Whatmakes someone behave in a way that fails to conform to heteronormative behaviour’. It is nolonger homosexuality that can be cured but the attributes and behaviours of those whose liveshave been blighted by homophobia. As Harwood argues, this ‘post-pathological’ intelligibility ofhomosexuality, ‘superficially appears not to situate homosexuality as mental illness, but rathersituates mental illness as the risk wrought by homosexuality’ (2004, p. 102). What is at stake hereare imaginations of what it might be to be a ‘liberated’ gay. While never addressed explicitly, thischallenging homophobic bullying in schools 191emancipatory projection can be identified within the empirical literature about homophobicbullying and in a variety of other cultural texts.Rivers and Cowie’s work calculates the impact of homophobic bullying against assessments of‘psychopathology in adulthood’ – a concept that, amongst other things, is evaluated by relationshipstatus and duration of relationships (2006, p. 29). This seemingly neutral psychological assessmentis emblematic of a form of child developmentalism which has been subject to sustained critiqueby numerous theorists of childhood. Underlying their critiques, often informed by Foucauldianinsights about the power of a depoliticised psy-expertise and knowledge, is a willingness to questionthe norms against which psychological functioning adulthood is evaluated. As Walkerdine argues:‘The subject is not made social, but rather the social is the site for the production of discursivepractices which produce the possibility of being a subject’ (2009, p. 19).32 Consequently, whileRivers, as quoted above, argues that research should explore in more detail why some victims ofbullying appear able to ‘successfully negotiate adulthood’, what is left unanswered are criticalquestions about what that ‘successfully negotiated’ adulthood might look like and who defines it.These critical perspectives have a particular resonance with queer theorists such as Eve Sedgwick,who demonstrated how the removal of homosexuality from the catalogue of psychological disordershas been followed by the discovery and inclusion of new (‘DSM recognised’) pathologies (1991).Whatis significant in this context is the extent to which these neutral scientific perceptions cohere withdominant political discourses new-found concern with homophobia. Rivers and Cowie’s (2006)use of relationships as an indicator of ‘successful adulthood’ is particularly relevant here.Within new ‘psychological disorders’, the inability to form ‘stable’ adult relationships isfrequently a key component and this problematisation coheres with the widespread politicalsupport for the Civil Partnership Act 2004 (CPA). For support was frequently premised, oftenexplicitly, on the view that it would enable and support lesbian and gays to establish stablerelationships. Indeed, some Conservative politicians have explicitly linked their support for theCPA with expressions of regret that the attitudes underlying their earlier support of Section 28may have prompted promiscuity amongst gay men.33 As Stychin argues in relation to the CPA:‘there is a message within the Act . . . that the encouragement of the rights and responsibilities ofcivil partnership through law will provide a disincentive for “irresponsible” behaviour. In thecontext of New Labour politics, irresponsibility seems to include promiscuous sex, relationshipbreakdown at will, and the selfishness of living alone (or perhaps even living with friends andacquaintances).’ (2006, p. 30)This approach is also adopted by some marriage-equality advocates within the LGBT community.Duggan argues that ‘many have couched their advocacy in language that glorifies marital bliss,sometimes echoing the “family values” rhetoric of their opponents’. As an example she quotes theRoadmap to Equality: A Freedom to Marry Educational Guide, which states that: ‘Denying marriagerights to lesbian and gay couples keeps them in a state of permanent adolescence’ (Duggan, 2004).34What is significant here is that while the failure to allocate rights is linked to pathological32 See also Harwood (2004) and Talburt (2004).33 See, for example, an interview with Conservative Party Chairman Francis Maude MP (2006): ‘Tories’ GayStance was “Wrong”’, BBC News, Thursday, 9 February 2006. Available at <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4696236.stm> (last visited 19 November 2010).34 Another recent example of this approach from within the lesbian and gay community is the fact thatpromiscuity was described as being a ‘negative’ portrayal in the report of the representations of lesbiansand gays in the media, as opposed to ‘suffering’, which was described as ‘negative but realistic’ (Stonewall,2010, p. 3).192 daniel monkdevelopment, this is not an uncomplicated form of passive victimhood, for the demand ofresponsibility with rights both acknowledges and demands action on behalf of the new rightsholders. As Rose argues, ‘Citizenship becomes conditional on conduct’ (2000, p. 335).Stychin’s analysis of debates about the CPA went beyond sexual practice to incorporate broadereconomic calculations and the extent to which ‘stable relationships’ cohered with neoliberaldiscourses about the privatisation of care. Echoes of this can also be identified here. Rivers’sassessment of psychopathology in adulthood also includes employment status and this linkagereinforces Ellis’s observation that concern about homophobic bullying cohered neatly with NewLabour’s managerialist calculations and broader education reforms premised on clearlyidentifiable outcomes and audits of economic citizenship. In this vein, he asks rhetorically:‘Is it a coincidence that recent policy and guidance from both a neo-liberal government and fromthe voluntary sector focus on how risky and disruptive identities might bemanaged safely to ensurethe production of auditable outcomes? (2007, p. 23, emphasis added)35Alongside concerns about promiscuity, other cultural texts also provide insight into the extent towhich the rejection of homophobia coheres with pathologising understandings of non-conformistpractices. For example, a causal link is often identified between the experience of homophobicbullying as a child and an adult preference for sado-masochistic (SM) sexual activity. In thedocumentary Pleasure and Pain, flashbacks to being bullied at school are linked to sexualsubmissiveness – the depravity of SM being perceived as a direct result of the bullying (Sullivan,2003, p. 154). Significantly, here, and in other contexts,36 it is the submissive role that is theremarked upon and pathologised position. And the silence about the desire to dominate attests tothe extent to which psychological perceptions of normality are informed by cultural norms – inthis case of a particular construct of masculinity.The empirical literature on homophobic bullying frequently reveals that sports and changingrooms are the most feared places within the school (Rivers and Duncan, 2002; Warwick et al.,2006). And, as referred to above, the Conservative Party’s policy document about children wasentitled More Ball Games, in order to present a reassuring image of normal stable childhood. But,in this context, what is noticeable is that other cultural texts present a tantalising representationof a post-homophobic world within which the playing of sports features highly – in order topresent a reassuring image of a ‘liberated’ normal stable homosexuality. An example of this is twosoap operas, Eastenders on BBC1 and The Archers on BBC Radio 4. In both of these programmes, thepublic broadcasting company, in an almost Reithian educational role, portrays their resolutely ‘outand proud’ gay characters playing sports alongside the heterosexual male members of theirrespectively urban and rural communities (Christian playing five-a-side football in the former andAdam cricket in the latter), and both are star players in their teams.37A telling silence here is that popular media representations of lesbians – of which there are farfewer – never emphasise sporting prowess. Such a portrayal would, of course, conform to a35 In the context of economic citizenship it is interesting to note that the only reference to lesbians and gays inthe Conservative Party general election manifesto was to tax benefits for those in civil partnerships (2010,p. 35).36 Franklin, in his analysis of the famous trial of Leopold and Loeb, reveals howmedical discourses pathologisedLeopold’s desire to be a ‘submissive slave’ to Loeb as evidence of his emotional and sexual depravity (2003,p. 139).37 That the playing of sport – and playing well – functions as a key motif for the portrayal of confident post-homophobic identity is similarly demonstrated by the fact that annual international LGBT Human Rightsconferences are now coupled with Out Games – a sporting competition.challenging homophobic bullying in schools 193stereotypical image of adult lesbians or, in children, of tomboys (Cockburn and Clarke; 2002;Halberstam, 2004). Consequently, the portrayal of a lesbian in a media drama ably playing sporthas none of the ‘liberatory discursive power’ that it has with a gay man. In other words, liberationin this discourse is profoundly heteronormative, linked as it is to binary gender conformity.The coupling of sporting prowess with ‘liberation’ is not new. Most striking is the extent to whichit mirrors constructions of Jewish masculinity. The similarities here are far from coincidental. AsGilman has demonstrated, for much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, ‘Jew’ and‘homosexual’ were virtually synonymous and interchangeable categories of social and sexualdifference (Gilman, 1993, pp. 36–48, 132–68). Significantly, as with homosexuality andhomophobia now, the causal link made between the unliberated, weak and feminine male Jewand anti-semitism was frequently espoused by those explicitly concerned with challenginganti-semitism.38That both individual and collective ‘liberation’ is linked to (and conditional on) a particularperformance of masculinity is not surprising. Sedgwick reminded us long ago that ‘the gaymovement has never been quick to attend to the issues concerning effeminate boys’ (1991,p. 20).39 Similarly, Weiss comments that ‘the celebration of effeminate flamboyance – femininityin the face of “male power” – is precisely what is excluded from homonormativity gay activism’(2008, p. 92). Linking this silence with broader political strategies, Bell and Binnie argue that:‘When sexual dissidents make use of rights-based political strategies to demand citizenship, theymust conform to a prevailing model of acceptability that is “privatized, de-radicalized,de-eroticized, and confined”.’ (2000, p. 3)There is then a paradox: failure to conform to particular ideals of behaviour are read as indicators ofthe harmful effects of bullying, but, at the same time, freedom from bullying is evaluated against anability to conform to those same ideals. Nevertheless, queer perspectives that seek to reveal thesetensions do not discard homophobia or deny that it causes real harm and suffering. Moreover,they sometimes offer simply an alternative causal reading of its effects. So, for example, embracingsado-masochism and celebrating promiscuity (Sullivan, 2003, 151–67; Thompson, 1995) andrejecting the hyper-masculinity of many forms of contemporary gay male culture (Muñoz, 2009,pp. 78–79) are often provided as evidence of ‘liberation’ from heteronormativity.40 The aim here isnot to attempt to arbitrate or judge these competing truth claims but to be attuned to theirdiscursive power and, in particular, to make visible the political dynamics underlyinghomophobic bullying agendas which are masked by developmentalist modes of thinking andinvestment in the child as future.41‘Responsible’ memories?One might reasonably ask whether in highlighting the existence of homophobia in schools anddeveloping strategies that enable it to be acknowledged by policy-makers it is necessary to engage38 For example, Elisha Friedman argued in a US medical journal that Jewish predominance in scholarly andmercantile pursuits was the result of anti-semitic exclusions (1923, pp. 352–53, quoted in Franklin, 2003,p. 143).39 Another recent example is the finding that femininity is perceived as ‘negative’ in a report of therepresentations of lesbians and gays in the media: (Stonewall, 2010, p. 6).40 For a particularly nuanced overview and analysis of the debates and ‘productive’ tensions between ‘gay’ and‘queer’ and ‘assimilation’ and ‘transgression’ see Stychin (2005).41 See Lesnik-Oberstein and Thomson (2002) for an analysis of how queer theory premised on challengingheteronormativity is deeply wedded to psychoanalytical discourse.194 daniel monkwith conflicting imaginations about an idealised post-homophobic world. The argument here is thatit is, for if homophobic bullying is made speakable through discourses of heteronormativity, thenthose outcomes become the form through which its success is evaluated. In other words it canlead to a pathologising of behaviours – ironically those that often signify resistance tohomophobia. Moreover, this form of pathologising is a particularly invasive form which resonateswith broader shifts in governance within contemporary advanced liberal societies (Rose, 1999).Garland argues that ‘where the state once targeted the deviant for intensive transformative action,it now aims to bring about marginal but effective changes in the norms, routines, and theconsciousness of everyone’ (1996, p. 454). Reece has analysed this form of governance as a form of‘(post) liberalism’. This concept is distinct from both conservative morality and laissez-faireliberalism as it imposes a demanding model of ‘responsibility’ to the extent that it demands thatthe individual internalise responsibility rather than simply conform to hierarchical juridicalcommands. Within this model, Reece argues that ‘psychological norms have replaced socialnorms, and therapeutic correctness has become the new standard of good behaviour’ (2003,p. 217). For Rose, this represents a form of ‘government at a distance’ which, through concepts of‘empowerment’ and ‘self-esteem’, serves to mask strategies of control:‘the beauty of empowerment is that it appears to reject the logics of patronizing dependency thatinfused earlier welfare models of expertise. Subjects are to do the work themselves, not in thename of conformity, but to make them free . . . High self-esteem is linked to the power to planone’s life as an orderly enterprise and take responsibility for its course and outcome.’ (2000,pp. 334–35)These broader insights into this shift in governance clearly cohere with queer theoretical concernsabout the conditions of inclusion within civil society. For therapeutic correctness requiresindividuals to explain and to account for their failure to conform to traditional relationshipmodels, their sexual ‘perversions’ and, indeed, their unhappiness, by connecting with childhoodtrauma. The relatively recent predominance of the expression ‘internalised homophobia’ as awidely understood phenomenon within both pyschotherapeutic circles and LGBT communitiesmore widely, not only attests to homophobia as an external force to be challenged but also,implicitly, places a burden on the individual to unravel and question its negative impacts.42 AsKitzinger argues, ‘Instead of going to heterosexual therapists to be cured of our homosexuality,now lesbian and gay men are supposed to seek out lesbian and gay therapists to be cured ofinternalized homophobia’ (1997, p. 211).In this context it is significant that much of the research on homophobic bullying draws on adultlesbian and gay accounts of their childhoods (Rivers and Cowie, 2006) and, similarly, to note thepreponderance of queer theorists drawing on their own personal narratives (Warner, 2004; Muñoz,2009, pp. 67–73). In these narratives memory plays a crucial role. Carol Smart, drawing on thework of Misztal (2003), argues that we need to ‘grasp the chameleon nature of memory’, that it,‘works in unstable ways, notwithstanding that it almost always appears to have the status of themost authentic and most signifying act of identity creation’ (2007, pp. 40–41). In foregroundingthe fact that ‘even individual memory is social’, she argues that ‘Memories can change to suit an42 For a nuanced critique of this concept see Williamson (2000). The aim here is not to dismiss the potentialbenefits of psychological perceptions or calculations, but rather to identify, as Adam Phillips argues, theways in which, at least explicitly, psychology concerns itself far more with disavowal and lack than it doeswith affirmation and world making. Moreover, as Phillips argues, ‘if we are living in the age of thespecialist, then psychoanalysis can be useful as a critique of the whole project of wanting authorities’(1995, pp. xx1 and xiii).challenging homophobic bullying in schools 195audience or to fit a newly crafted identity’ (2007, p. 41, emphasis added).43 The aim here is not todiscount memories but to be attuned to their productive role and their dependence on theavailability of language and dominant discourses and, in particular, to look beneath individualaccounts to reveal the collective political meaning-making inherent in the project of naming,challenging and resisting homophobic bullying.Lawful violence: institutional homophobia and the criminal gazeIn this final section the focus shifts from the bullied to the bully. In contrast to the construction of the‘responsible victim’, here we find a return to the subject of traditional hierarchical forms of control:the demonised criminal other. Yet, while the role of the state in this context is more direct, moreexplicit, it, similarly, is heard through ‘common-sense’ narratives that have the effect of maskingthe political.‘Bullying’ and homophobiaA key way in which the homophobic bullying agenda is depoliticised is through the discourse ofbullying itself. History is significant here, for while homophobia in schools has been writtenabout in earlier periods (particularly in the context of Section 28), the fact that bullying is nowthe key focus remains unremarked upon. The argument here is that the coupling of ‘homophobic’with ‘bullying’ is not straightforward, but, rather, a linkage that plays a productive role indetermining the construction of the harms focused on and the legitimacy of the means used tochallenge them.Bullying is spoken of not just in the context of children, but also in relation to adults’ lives,particularly in the workplace. In recent years there has developed what is fair to describe as a vastindustry defining, deploring and highlighting the ills of bullying (Smith, 2005; Rigby, 2002).44 It isbeyond the remit of this article to attempt to explore the genealogy of bullying as a discourse.That said, however, an attempt to do so could locate its ascendancy within the broaderdevelopments of neoliberal individualistic governance, the increasing dominance of psy-discoursesand, of particular relevance here, a reinscription of the political as primarily private. Theworkplace provides a good example of this. In the vast majority of incidences now labelled asbullying, the bully is the employer; indeed, a report by the Institute of Management suggestedthat bullying was part of the new management credo (2000). A political response would be to seesuch relationships as reflecting broader structural inequalities within the workplace and societymore generally; in other words, as a labour relations issue.45 Read through the narrative ofbullying, however, and this political potential is lost and the issue is individualised as the bully isconstructed through a pathological gaze. This is not to suggest that psychology, broadly defined,has nothing to offer in explaining why a particular individual might behave towards colleagues orstaff in a particular way. But it is important to be attuned to what is at the same time silencedthrough such an account.46If homophobic bullying is caused by homophobic bullies, consequently is individualised, whatgets overlooked are structural forms of homophobia. Many of these are implicit and subtle; inother words the opposite to explicit juridical prohibitions such as Section 28. Examples are the43 See also Talburt (2004).44 See also <www.antibullyingalliance.org> (last visited 18 November 2010).45 A report by the Institute of Management suggested that bullying was part of the new management credo(IOM, 2000).46 For example, research undertaken by the TUC suggests that the groups most likely to be bullied are women,ethnic minorities and people with disabilities <www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/index.cfm?mins = 30> (last visited18 November 2010).196 daniel monkemphasis on parental involvement in sex and relationship education and the privileged space (andcontingent definition) of biologywithin the curriculum (Monk, 1998). Beyond the formal curriculumnumerous commentators have long identified the existence and observed the impact of the ‘hiddencurriculum’ in relation to heterosexism and gender more generally across almost every aspect ofschool life (O’Flynn and Epstein, 2005; Kehilly, 2002).One aspect of the ‘hidden curriculum’ is school dress codes. These have a particular relevance inthis context as they are highly gendered and conforming to gender stereotypes is identified in muchof the literature as being a critical factor in homophobic bullying (Phoenix et al., 2003). The Equalitiesand Human Rights Commission recently argued in relation to school dress codes that becausetrousers are conventional dress for women and jewellery is equally conventional dress for men,‘there is a strong argument that it would be unlawful sex discrimination to deny’ these forms ofdress for children in school.47 Such an argument has yet to be tested, but on the basis of increasedsupport for school dress codes, and stricter application of them, coupled with an extremereluctance of the courts to intervene in ‘educational’ matters, it is unlikely to succeed (Monk,2005). Indeed to describe dress codes as an ‘informal’ aspect of education can be misleading asthey are understood to be a key aspect of school discipline and one that can warrant the ultimatepenalty of permanent exclusion.That government and individual schools’ commitment to rigorously enforcing gendered dresscodes can co-exist with an explicit commitment to challenging homophobia, despite the repeatedevidence of the connections between heteronormativity and gender performance, demonstratesthe highly restrictive manner in which challenging homophobic bullying is heard.Bullying narratives – individualistic, depoliticised and, increasingly, drawing on pathologicalexplanations of inappropriate behaviour – cohere and lend themselves with great ease to acriminal law paradigm. Critical legal commentators have for many years examined the ways inwhich legal causation is distinct from factual causation, to the extent that the former goesbackwards – which is say that it starts with the harm, identifies the individual perpetrator andthen stops – and that in doing so it does not ask or enquire and does not need to examine broader,political cultural factors that influenced the behaviour of the perpetrator. In this way, likebullying discourses, it simplifies and individualises, requiring simply the identification of a victimand a perpetrator (Norrie, 2001, pp. 134–40).Furniss has argued in favour of criminal law responses to bullying in order to challenge the extentto which ‘teachers may see bullying as an inevitable part of growing up’ (2000, p. 17). Moreover,echoing long-standing debates about domestic violence and the physical chastisement of children,she argues that:‘By treating attacks on adults as worthy of a serious response, but attacks on children as not, thissends out the message that the bodily integrity of children is not as important as that of adults.’(p. 24)Criminal law is not, however, the only form of legal redress: provisions under the EuropeanConvention of Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child can beinterpreted to create positive obligations on the state to prevent bullying; civil law claims can bebrought by parents and children based on the duty of care of schools to pupils; and quasi-criminallaw sanctions in the form of school exclusions can be used against individuals (Harris, 2005).48 Yetdespite these different forms of legal interventions, in reality it is the quasi-criminal form of47 <www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and-guidance/education-and-training-providers/fair-treatment-when-in-education/school-uniform/> (last visited 12 August 2010).48 For comparative approaches see Ananiadou and Smith (2002).challenging homophobic bullying in schools 197redress that is the most accessible. The case of Bradford-Smart v. West Sussex CC in 2002 extended aschool’s duty of care to taking reasonable steps to prevent bullying within the school and madeclear that this was an educational as well as a health and safety issue.49 But in practice it isexceptionally difficult to satisfy the doctrinal requirements that there be evidence of the breach ofduty and a causal connection between the breach of duty and the harm. Furthermore, where theharm is psychological it is necessary to show that it takes the form of a clinically recognisedmental health problem. The contrast between the difficulties facing a child or parent attemptingto bring a school or teacher to account in a civil action and the remarkable ease with which aschool can discipline a pupil is stark. The underlying similarity is that in both contexts the courtscan be seen to err on the side of schools, for it is as hard for parents to challenge an exclusion as itis to bring a claim for negligence. What is significant here is that both legal doctrine and practicereflects and bolsters the inherent tendency of the bullying narrative to focus on an individualperpetrator and in doing so shift the focus away from institutional and more complex structuralunderstandings.It is possible to view the intervention of law as a form not only of individual redress but also asjustice for all lesbian and gay children. A right to be free from homophobic bullying in this way fitsneatly with rights-based discourse. There are significant parallels here with lesbian and gaycampaigns for the recognition of homophobia as a form of hate crime. While demandingwidespread support – often of an unquestionable ‘common-sense’ nature – this recourse to lawand, once again, the criminal paradigm, like campaigns for gay marriage, and gays in the military,has not been without its critics. Before turning to these critics it is informative to locate thesedevelopments in both the local context of the school and in broader criminological debates.School disciplineThe only statutory reference to bullying is in the context of school discipline,50 and this focus hasbeen clearly espoused in recent political statements. For example, in More Ball Games theConservative Party suggest that in tackling bullying there should be increased use of exclusionsand firmer use of parent contracts (2008, p. 10). Moreover, in the 2010 general election both majorparties argued in support of head teachers’ extensive disciplinary powers; the Conservative Partystated that it will ‘stop them being overruled by bureaucrats on exclusions’ (2010, p. 51), and theLabour Party, under the heading ‘Zero Tolerence of Poor Behaviour’, stated that it will ‘bring orderand discipline back to young people’s lives’ (2010, Chapter 3:5).In these political responses there is no mention of institutional homophobia. Moreover, therepeated calls for zero tolerance in relation to bullying reveals how homophobic bullying is madespeakable in this way through its ability to cohere with a conservative law and order discourse. Asa result the significant race and class dimensions of exclusions (Parsons, 1999; Parsons and Harris,2001; Parsons, 2009) and the impact on poor parents (almost always the mothers), who throughparenting contracts are increasingly held responsible for their children’s behaviour, are overlookedand silenced in this account (Gillies, 2005; Gewirtz, 2001). As Harris argues, the disciplinaryresponse to bullying risks the ‘complete abandonment of the perpetrators of bullying who . . .often have mental health or behavioural problems themselves’ (2005, p. 57).Law and orderThe inability to reduce the use of exclusions and increased assertions of the necessity for ever moredraconian school discipline in schools resonates with broader criminological developments.49 Bradford-Smart v. West Sussex CC [2002] ELR 139.50 The Schools Standards and Frameworks Act 1998, Section 61 (now section 98 of the Education andInspections Act 2006).198 daniel monkThe criminologist Rutherford describes increased penality as a form of managing socialbehaviour as the re-emergence of the ‘eliminative ideal’. An ideal which ‘strives to solve presentand emerging problems by getting rid of troublesome and disagreeable people with methods thatare lawful and widely supported’, he argues, ‘sits all too comfortably with contemporary pressuresfor social exclusion, with notions of a culture of containment’ (1997, pp. 117, 132). Expressing asimilar concern, Bauman refers to an emergence of the notion of ‘disposability’, and argues thatthe possibility for harsh sanctions rests upon ‘twin assumptions: a clean-cut territorial divisionbetween the “inside” and the “outside”; and of the completeness and indivisibility of thesovereignty of the strategy-selecting power inside its realm’ (2003, p. 137).Rutherford argues that the eliminative ideal provides a seductive but dangerously false senseof collective certainty and security,51 and that challenges to this trend need to address boththe instrumental and the expressive dimensions of the eliminative ideal. The expressive dimensionowes much to Durkheim’s classic rejection of utilitarian explanations of punishment; that it isnever ‘a rational social defence against harm done or threatened’ but, ‘a passionate reaction, amatter of feelings’. While his subsequent application of this idea has been much critiqued, this,still bold, assertion is particularly pertinent here and, indeed, recognising the emotionaldimension of penality coheres with much of the critical thinking about homophobia as hatecrime.52In keeping with her argument that it is important to be attuned to the ambivalent effects ofshame, Munt argues that:‘Shame puts us in our place, but the spaces of subjectivity are not wholly fixed or predetermined;shame’s loss carries uncertainty, but it also presages a desire for reconnection. It is this desire forre-attachment that has the precarious potential for violence or love.’ (2007, p. 103, emphasis added)The potential for violence in the context of challenging homophobia consequently coheres with callsto utilise both school discipline policies and the criminal law as a political tool in the demand forrights and protection by the state. Murphy and Hampton argue that:‘criminal law institutionalizes certain feelings of anger, resentment and even hatred that aretypically directed towards wrong doers, especially if we are the victims of those wrong doers.’(1988, p. 63, quoted in Moran, 2004, p. 940)Moran, in examining the implications of this in the context of demands for hate crime legislation hassought to make visible and encourage reflection on the ‘alliances that lesbian and gay men aremaking with law and order’ (2004, p. 942)53 Visibility, naming and recognising the violence of lawis critical here. For penalising hate crime and, in this context, school disciplinary action againsthomophobic bullies, as acts done in the name of law and order are emptied of, and indeedperceived as the opposite of, emotions and disorder. As Moran argues:51 Garland similarly argues that punitive responses are frequently ‘barely considered attempts to express popularfeelings of rage and frustration’, but are at the same time ‘a form of denial which appears increasinglyhysterical’ about the state’s limitations in respect of crime control (1996, pp. 459–60).52 For a detailed analysis and an apologist for Durkheim’s perspectives on social solidarity and crime, seeCotterrell (1999).53 Nancy Fraser (1995) has explored in depth the tensions inherent in developing a critical theory of recognition,one which identifies and defends only those versions of the cultural politics of difference that can becoherently combined with the social politics of equality.challenging homophobic bullying in schools 199‘as dimensions of retribution, they become civilised by being made in the image of reason andrationality and are thereby made to disappear. Through this process they take their place as apart of law’s legitimacy.’ (p. 925)It is important to acknowledge here that this act of legitimation equally masks the ‘homophobicviolence’ of head teachers rigorously enforcing gendered dress codes: ‘law’s violence becomes goodviolence’ (p. 925). But, in relation to the disciplined, excluded, punished ‘homophobic’ pupil, thelegitimate violence of law serves to not only mask its own homophobia but positions it elsewhere,outside, onto an ‘uncivilised other’. And once again it is important to recognise that schooldiscipline and exclusions, as with criminal justice generally, has a hugely disproportionate classeddimension (Parsons, 1999). As Munt observes, in what she describes as ‘shame logic’:‘Violence is transposed onto these marginal spaces in a discursive shift that empties middle classlife of any accountability . . . Dominant discourse has long conflated non-normative subjectivitieswith criminality and threat; indeed, there is a kind of discursive contagion operating in whichshame is infectiously displaced.’ (2007, p. 99)This concern resonates with current debates about the construction of Islam as the ‘uncivilised other’to secular liberal human rights; and here again school dress codes have been a critical site for thisconflict (Motha, 2007; McGoldrick, 2006). That liberal agendas in the name of human rights haveserved to cohere with and play a role in increasing hate underscores Brown’s question: ‘Whatkinds of attachments to unfreedom can be discerned in contemporary political formationsostensibly concerned with emancipation?’ (1995, p. xii). This concern suggests that it is worthreflecting, at the very least, on the fact that mainstream concern with homophobic bullyingcoheres with concerns about Islamic fundamentalism.‘Attachment to unfreedom’ can also be detected in the attempt to contain and control the use ofthe word ‘gay’ being used within schools. Much of the literature on homophobic bullying emphasisesits use as a derogatory term (Rivers, 2001a; Matthews, 2001; DCSF/Stonewall, 2007; Winterman,2008)54. Incidences of this are used to assess the extent of homophobic bullying in schools and itsapparent widespread use in this way is consequently a key factor in the ability to presenthomophobic bullying as being ‘endemic’ and thus plays a role in extending the category of ‘abuse’.The aim here is not to deny that young people may experience it as hurtful, and far less to denythat speech itself can be harmful. Rather, the argument here is that it might not always have thatimpact and that attempts to curtail speech may have contradictory effects.Many young people, including young lesbians and gays, confronted with the use of the word ‘gay’as a derogatory term suggest that they ‘don’t mean it in that way’, and that it does not reflect anegative view of lesbians and gays. The silencing of this account reinforces the concern that thehomophobic bullying agenda, while premised on research with young people, looks for harm and,like much research with children, fails rigorously to engage with the ‘life-world’ of young peoplethemselves (Blackburn, 2007). Acknowledging the complexity of children’s experiences haspractical implications, for, as Blackburn argues, ‘when youth claim multiple subject positions,they are better able to identify, name and work against oppression’ (p. 50). Being sensitive to theability of the word ‘gay’ to have different and contextualised meanings is important. As Butlerargues, drawing on Austin’s concept of performative utterance, the context-specific meaning ofspeech is a critical factor to take into account in evaluating the uses of censorship (Butler, 1997).She also makes the strategic argument that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise,54 See also ‘Challenging Homophobic Language, Stonewall Education Guide’ available at <www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/quick_links/education_resources/4006.asp> (last visited 20 November 2010).200 daniel monknecessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid (pp. 129–33).55 A similar argument, byJacobs and Potter, is made in relation to hate crime generally. They argue that it mobilises newprejudices and ‘exacerbate[s] rather than ameliorate[s] social schisms and conflicts’ (1998, p. 144,quoted in Moran, 2004, p. 945).Mindful of the dangers of ‘investment in simplistic violent hierarchies of politics as eitherprogressive or reactionary’ (Moran, 2009, p. 312), and in recognition of the ambivalent impact ofhate crime, Moran has argued that ‘using violence as a resource to make a claim on the statebecomes a way of gaining back the control that has been lost through violence itself’, that law canplay an important educational role and that it need not promote the status quo but ‘offer asignificant challenge to its heterosexism’ (2004, p. 942). In a similar vein, Grabham suggestsalternatives to readings of identity-based legal rights claims as always an investment inpowerlessness and injury, arguing that:‘subjects make an impression on law when they make rights arguments, and these impressionscirculate within law as traces of the hurt and trauma that they have experienced . . . They maynot be expressly counter-cultural, but they do give rise to a “public culture”.’ (2009, p. 199)Identifying potential concerns about lesbian and gay engagement with law and order agendas (in thiscontext demands for recourse to disciplinary responses to homophobic bullying) is, consequently,not to argue against these forms of engagement, but rather to suggest a need for reflection aboutthem, in order to question the implicit political alliances that underpin them and to locate lesbianand gay political agendas within broader social and economic structures.Conclusion‘Children are forced to solicit our anxieties, our delights, our ethics, our love, or really any form ofour attention, especially when politics and moral values are made an issue.’ (Cobb, 2005, p. 119)The increased attention to and concern about homophobic bullying is a welcome development. Andthis article should not be read as an abstract criticism of the necessarilymessy and pragmatic businessof influencing policy-makers. Rather, its aim has been to raise a different set of questions.Highlighting how the twin constructions of victimhood – the innocent child and the tragic gay–dominate both academic and political narratives about homophobic bullying is not to deny realharm but to reveal the conditionality of what, on the surface, appears to be an inclusive progressivepolitics. The political is similarly revealed by identifying how concerns about lesbian and gaychildren operate as a site for broader aspirations, imaginations and contestations about a post-homophobic world and the ways in which these contestations require a form of active citizenshipin accordance with the subtle shifts in governance in post- or advanced liberal societies. Finally,bringing the notion of victimhood together with an examination of the disciplinary (quasi-criminal) responses, questions have been asked about the political alliances and broader socialdevelopments that underlie seemingly ‘common-sense’ narratives of harm and causation. The factthat, in relation to legal responses, the emphasis is exclusively on disciplinary measures is farfrom straightforward, but, rather a reflection of precisely the way in which the harm isconstructed and how it is produced by and within broader political narratives.55 In a similar way, in examining the implications of a particular form of recognition politics, Fraser argues that‘the practice of affirmative redistribution, as iterated over time, tends to set inmotion a second – stigmatizing –recognition dynamic, which contradicts universalism’ (1995, p. 85).challenging homophobic bullying in schools 201It is too early to tell how the issue will be addressed in the future, and the very real shift inmainstream thinking about sexuality, which this article does not underestimate, demonstrates thepotential for change. But it may be that the very means by which the issue has been madespeakable could limit more radical developments. In recognition of the fact that schools werescared to touch the issue of homosexuality in any way, one of the earliest documents abouthomophobic bullying was entitled Playing it safe! (Warwick, Aggleton and Douglas, 2001). In someschools much has changed, but this article suggests reflection about, and questions what the costsare, of the progressive agenda itself ‘playing it safe’.Referencesananiadou, Katerina and smith, Peter K.

    "abstract": "In recent years homophobic bullying has received increased attention from NGOs, academics and government sources and concern about the issue crosses traditional moral and political divisions. This article examines this ‘progressive’ development and identifies the ‘conditions of possibility’ that have enabled the issue to become a harm that can be spoken of. In doing so it questions whether the\n\nreadiness to speak about the issue represents the opposite to prohibitions on speech (such as the notorious Section 28) or whether it is based on more subtle forms of governance. It argues that homophobic bullying is heard through three key discourses (‘child abuse’, ‘the child victim’ and ‘the tragic gay’) and that, while enabling an acknowledgement of certain harms, they simultaneously\n\nsilence other needs and experiences. It then moves to explore the aspirational and ‘liberatory’ political investments that underlie these seemingly ‘common-sense’ descriptive discourses and concludes with a critique of the quasi-criminal responses that the dominant political agenda of homophobic bullying gives rise to. The article draws on, and endeavours to develop a conversation between, critical engagements with the contemporary politics of both childhood and sexuality",
