Due to the negligence of their physicians, these patients were subjected to unnecessary and irreversible surgery.12● Acting in the “patient’s best interest” is nearly impossible because there is no objective scale to accurately determine each individual patient’s best interest as they mature.14 Physicians cannot ensure that a decision as permanent as genital reassignment surgery will have a favorable outcome for an infant or child post-puberty. ● If an intersex infant or child rejects the sex that they were surgically assigned, they may face a lifetime of pain and psychological suffering. ● The performance of medically unnecessary intersex surgery violates the principle of nonmaleficence because the patient is put at high and unreasonable risk of physical harm and the psychological pain associated with rejecting the sex assigned to them.Principle of Autonomy● The United States is the only member of the UN that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)● The CRC endorses the idea that states should “ensure that no-one is subjected to unnecessary medical or surgical treatment during infancy or childhood, guarantee bodily integrity, autonomy and self-determination to children concerned, and provide families with intersex children with adequate counselling and support.”● Dangerous and irreversible intersex surgeries violate a person’s s right to autonomy over their own future 12● The child should be respected as a member of the decision making process because even young children, from the age of 6 or 7, can begin to express preferences, understand biological processes, and reflect on their identity 14Wendy, a mother of twins, was expecting to have twin girls. She had selected names for her twins but after giving birth, Wendy was told to reevaluate her choice of names by her physician. The physician was unsure if one of the newborns was a boy or girl. Blood tests showed that one of the twins had XY chromosomes with ambiguous external genitalia. While the baby was in the NICU and the baby’s survival was uncertain, Wendy was approached by surgeons to operate on the baby for genital reassignment surgery. Since leaving the hospital with her child, Wendy was repeatedly urged to allow surgeons to operate and transform her child into a “normal girl”, which would be an easier surgery, or a  “real man”, who could eventually “stand up and pee”. After attending an intersex surgery conference to learn more about her child’s condition, Wendy opted to not have surgery performed on her child. In making this decision about her genetically male son, Wendy rationalized, “I don't want to do something that can't be undone.” The child, known as Stephen, shared that he sits down to urinate, but he has never faced any bullying or harrassment from peers as a result of being intersex. Wendy reported that because Stephen has such good health, she avoids taking him to any medical appointments unless it is an emergency. Both Wendy and Stephen dread going to doctor appointments because they are still urged to consider surgery, even though Stephen is comfortable in his body. Wendy and Stephen fear that they will be pressured to undergo a medically unnecessary surgery if they pursue routine medical care. 14Development of Reproductive Organs● The differentiation between male and females happens early in gestation, occurring around nine weeks. Around this time, the gonads either change into testes or ovaries ● The default pathway of differentiation is referred to as feminization, where the gonads turn into ovaries.● In order to divert from the default pathway of feminization and get male development,  the SRY, which encodes for testes, needs to present and two processes need to occur.○ Defeminization: This process prevents the development of a female reproductive tract ○ Masculinization: The result is a penis, scrotum, epididymis, and vas deferens, but also a male brain.● Each of these processes is governed by the hormonal milieu secreted from the testes. Masculinization is due mostly to a large impulse of testosterone, while defeminization is due to a few other hormones, such as estradiol. Both processes are necessary to get us anything other than females.● Sometimes masculinization and defeminization do not work as intended, and the result is intersex, such as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome4Surgery for intersex infants should be delayed until individuals can decide for themselves in all cases except those where it is medically necessary. Due to high risk of harm against intersex people, further guidelines are suggested: 1) Intersex surgery should only be performed when there is strong evidence it is beneficial and not harmful.2) Intersex surgery should only be performed in cases of medical necessity.3) Intersex surgery should normally be delayed until the intersex person is able to assent to treatment or decide against it.4) Conventional ethical requirements regarding truth-telling apply equally to intersex children as they do to anyone else.5) If physicians or parents think surgery is in the best interest of the child, the burden of proof lies with them.Recommendations for Health Care Providers ● Physicians should interact with patients who speak about their experiences at medical conferences. This is a way for patient advocates to communicate with physicians and give them a better understanding of the outcomes of intersex surgery post-puberty as adults. ● Open communication with families and promote acceptance of individual development ● Avoid emotionally-driven decisions and delay non-urgent decisions until psychological counseling has been given. Promote participation of trained peers in the decision-making process. ● Establishment and integration of multidisciplinary “DSD Teams” in hospital settings to advocate on behalf of the intersex child’s rights The rights of intersex people not to undergo medical intervention for social and cultural reasons must be recognized. Thus, the development of rights-based clinical pathways and intersex-led advocacy and support groups must be prioritized.7  ● Reporting of intersex surgeries in the U.S is highly unregulated, so there should be policy for hospitals to report this in their databases.Recommendations for Parents● Biological: When explaining the condition to children, emphasize that it is a naturally occurring variation. ● Medical: Explain sex and gender as non-binary concepts and in the context of sex determination and differentiation. Furthermore, provide precise information on the specific conditions, including information regarding vital, functional and elective medical interventions, while emphasizing risk and benefits, and offer alternatives to provide patients with choices that respect their autonomy. ● Gender-Related: The parents should put forward gender contentedness as the ultimate goal. They should encourage self-expression of the developing child and allow them to modify their social gender role throughout development.7 1.

Background Information HistoryScientific ConsiderationsEthical Considerations Case StudyGuidelines and RecommendationsSourcesIntersex is an umbrella term used for people born with variations of chromosomes, hormones, and/or sex characteristics that do not correspond with the gender binary (male or female). In some cases, intersex can easily be identified by external sex characteristics at birth. In other cases, intersex babies may have external genitalia that fit typical male or female bodies, but have malformed, different, or no internal genitalia.10  Hence, intersex bodies can be discovered at birth, during puberty, or even adulthood. Because of this, there has been an unclear consensus on the diagnosis of intersex.1 It is important to note that intersex relates only to an individual’s biological sex characteristics and not their sexual orientation or gender identity. In the 20th century, medical  sex “normalizing” procedures were introduced to the treatment of intersex people. Upon this introduction, intersex people were subject to surgeries and hormonal therapies in attempts to “normalize” ambiguous genitalia and establish a gender at birth.9 Over time, it was shown that these medical interventions had negative, even fatal consequences in children.6 This has resulted in a societal failure to recognize intersex people in daily life, subjecting them to alienation, physical, and psychological trauma.

    "abstract": "Intersex individuals are born with sex characteristics that do not align with the binary expectations of male or female bodies. While intersex describes a wide variety of body phenotypes, some cases present visible intersex characteristics at birth, later on in life (puberty), or not at all. Intersex surgery uses medical intervention to modify atypical or ambiguous genitalia or sex characteristics. Individuals or their parents elect to undergo intersex surgery though it is not always medically necessary or advisable. The purpose of our study is to explore the biological and ethical underpinnings of intersex surgery over time",
