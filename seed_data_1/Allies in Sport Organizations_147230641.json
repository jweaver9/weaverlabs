Cunningham \n \nEmployee support is a key factor in creating more welcoming and accepting \nwork environments for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in \nsport. As such, organizations need to understand what factors encourage employees to \ndisplay attitudes and behaviors that support inclusion. Thus, the purpose of my \ndissertation was to advance the literature by examining antecedents and outcomes related \nto employee support for LGBT inclusion and equality in the workplace.  \nIn Study 1, I provide LGBT employees the opportunity to share their perceptions \nof support for LGBT inclusion, particularly how the attitudes and behaviors of their \ncoworkers foster or inhibit acceptance in the workplace. Results indicate that various \nmicro-level (demographics, personality, experiences with LGBT individuals) and meso-\nlevel factors (organizational culture for diversity, support of relevant others) influenced \nthe level of employee support for LGBT inclusive policies. Furthermore, power \nmeaningfully influenced these dynamics, such that individuals in low status positions \nwithin the athletic department were hesitant to show support for LGBT equality. \nHowever, those who did champion LGBT inclusive initiatives successfully modeled \n iv \nsupportive behaviors and positive attitudes toward LGBT individuals, vocally opposed \ndiscriminatory treatment, and provided sexual minorities with a safe space at work.  \nIn Study 2, I develop a multilevel model that addresses factors at the macro-level \n(i.e., mass media, inclusive community), meso-level (i.e., sexual orientation diversity, \npresence of other allies), and micro-level (i.e., personality, personal values, attitudes \ntoward LGBT individuals, contact with LGBT individuals) that influence ally support. In \naddition, I differentiate between attitudinal and behavioral support for LGBT equality, \nand discuss various factors that may encourage allies to engage in more active ally \nbehaviors.  \nIn Study 3, I drew from the multilevel model to examine how micro-, meso-, and \nmacro-level factors influence attitudinal support for sexual LGBT inclusion among sport \nemployees, and determine if these attitudes affect behavioral support for LGBT \ninclusion in the workplace. The results from the study offered support that multilevel \nfactors relate to support for LGBT inclusion. Specifically, sex, supervisor support, and \ntyped of media consumed were related to attitudinal support for LGBT inclusion, and \nthese attitudes positively associated with championing behaviors.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \nDEDICATION \n \nTo my parents, for saying, and believing, that I could do anything in this world; \nmy faithful companions Bogey and Winston, for always greeting me with smiling faces \nand wagging tails; and Christa, for being my everything. \n vi \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n              Page \nABSTRACT ..............................................................................................................  iii \nDEDICATION ..........................................................................................................       v \nTABLE OF CONTENTS ..........................................................................................  vi \nLIST OF FIGURES ...................................................................................................   viii \nLIST OF TABLES ....................................................................................................  ix \nCHAPTER \nI INTRODUCTION................................................................................ 1 \n   \nII WHO ARE THE CHAMPIONS?

In fact, \nrecent survey data from national opinion polls indicate a majority of Americans view \nsame-sex relationships as acceptable, and express support for legalizing same-sex \nmarriage (Herek, 2011). This shift in attitudes has had a considerable impact on policies \nand practices at the state, local, and organizational level. For instance, as of 2012, six \nstates and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage, 11 states provide civil \nunions or domestic partnerships, and a number of states and municipalities have \nnondiscrimination policies protecting LGBT individuals. And, while these strides are \nencouraging, the efforts among corporations to ensure LGBT inclusion are perhaps the \nmost noteworthy. According to the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality \nIndex, nearly 90% of Fortune 500 companies, and 96% of Fortune 100 companies, have \nimplemented some form of LGBT inclusion policy, with the majority of these firms also \noffering domestic partner benefits. The actions of privately held organizations are \nparticularly interesting considering no federal mandate requires them to include sexual \norientation in their nondiscrimination polices.   \nResearch examining the benefits of inclusive polices may point to why  \nThis dissertation follows the style of the Journal of Sport Management. \n 2 \norganizations have made such strides in terms of LGBT inclusion. First, studies \nconsistently demonstrate how workplaces that are antagonistic towards sexual minorities \ncan lead to a number of negative outcomes—for both the employee and the organization. \nFor instance, in Ragins (2008) review of invisible stigmas (e.g.,, sexual orientation) in \nthe workplace, she notes that sexual minorities oftentimes feel forced to conceal their \nsexual orientation in an effort to avoid prejudice and discrimination. According to \nRagins and Cronwell’s (2001) findings, the physical and psychological stress that \naccompanies having to constantly monitoring one’s behavior, due to the real or \nperceived threat of stigmatization, tends to adversely impact job satisfaction, \norganizational commitment, turnover intentions, and organizational self-esteem among \nLGBT employees. These negative effects are not limited to their work experiences, as \nthe mental health of sexual minorities can also suffer: persons who face discrimination \nand prejudice at work are more likely to experience greater anxiety (Herek & Garnets, \n2007), depression (Smith & Ingram, 2004) and psychological distress (Waldo, 1999).  \nWhat’s more, failing to create a workplace that accepts and supports sexual \nminorities can also hurt an organizations processes and performance. Specifically, when \norganizations have a diverse and inclusive work culture, they are better able to attract \ntalented and diverse job applicants (Fink et al., 2001; 2003), decrease turnover intentions \n(McKay et al., 2007), and create goodwill among consumers (Robinson & Dechant, \n1997)—this is particularly the case when organizations demonstrate public support for \nsexual minorities (Cunningham & Melton, 2011; Florida, 2003; 2004). Furthermore, \nthere is empirical evidence that suggests organizational performance is enhanced when \n 3 \norganizations couple high sexual orientation diversity with an inclusive work climate. \nFor instance, Cunningham’s work examining college athletic programs shows that \nhaving these characteristics positively relates to athletic performance in terms of \nchampionship wins (2011b), and greater creativity among athletic department staff and \nadministrators (2011a). Collectively, the aforementioned literature suggests it may be in \nthe best interest of the organization to ensure their workplace is accepting and supportive \nof LGBT employees.  \nAs such, more research now examines factors related to LGBT inclusion because \nscholars and practitioners alike recognize the social and business implications of \nproviding accepting and safe workplaces for all employees. Much of this work focuses \non formal organizational support—nondiscrimination statements, LGBT diversity \ntraining, domestic partnership benefits—(Button, 2001; Griffith & Hebl, 2002; Ragins et \nal., 2007), and shows that inclusive policies relate to greater disclosure, which can then \nenhance the work experiences of sexual minorities. While this work is both needed and \nbeneficial, it rarely considers outcomes other than disclosure or how other forms of \nsupport may impact inclusion. In one exception, Huffman et al. (2008) examined three \nunique types of support for LGBT employees—organizational, supervisor, and \ncoworker. Their results suggest each type of support led to a distinct outcome: \norganizational support predicted disclosure decisions, supervisor support related to job \nsatisfaction, and coworker support was associated with overall life satisfaction. The later \ntwo findings highlight the important role individuals can play in creating and sustaining \ninclusive work environments.  \n 4 \nFurthermore, Avery (2011) argues the success of any diversity and inclusion \ninitiative rests on the efforts of individual employees, and as such, organizations need to \nunderstand what factors encourage employees to display supportive attitudes and \nbehaviors. Unfortunately, few empirical investigations have sought to answer these \nquestions. This is a regrettable omission considering research suggests (a) inclusive \npolicies are ineffective without supervisor and coworker support (Griffith & Heble, \n2002), and (b) the attitudes and actions of employees can effectively create more \ninclusive work environments even in the absence of formal, organizational support \n(Brooks & Edwards, 2009; Fink et al, 2012). Rather, most studies examine causes and \nconsequences of sexual prejudice (for an extensive review see Herek, 2009) or focus on \nwhy individuals support LGBT equality outside of the work domain (Russell, 2011), \nsuch as campaigning for same-sex marriage, or volunteering for PFLAG (Parents, \nFamilies, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays). Thus, investigation’s examining the \nantecedents and outcomes associated with employee support in the workplace are \nwarranted and can offer both theoretical and practical contributions to this area of study.   \nThus, in this dissertation I attempt to further the field in this direction by carrying \nout three studies. In Study 1, I provide LGBT employees the opportunity to share their \nperceptions of support for LGBT inclusion, particularly how the attitudes and behaviors \nof their coworkers foster or inhibit acceptance in the workplace. Such an examination is \nmeaningful because of the impact inclusion can have on the professional and personal \nwell-being of these employees. Also, by interviewing sexual minorities, I am able to \ngain a greater understanding of how employees’ attitudes and behaviors can support \n 5 \ncauses or issues that are unique to the LGBT population. Specifically, I asked \nparticipants what forms of support were most meaningful in terms of creating inclusion \nfor sexual minorities. In addition, I drew from systems theory and ask them to discuss \norganizational and individual factors that might encourage employees to take a stand for \nLGBT equality.  \nIn study 2, I further extend the employee support literature by developing a \nmultilevel theoretical model for explaining ally support in sport organizations. In line \nwith Study 1, I drew from systems theory to examine how factors at the macro- \n(societal), meso- (organizational), and micro-level (individual) influence employees’ \nattitudes toward sexual minorities. From there, I discussed how attitudes toward sexual \nminorities (i.e., ally support) can manifest in various behavioral forms, which vary in \nlevel of commitment (compliance, cooperation, and championing)—with championing \nbehaviors being the highest level of commitment (see also Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002; \nCunningham, 2010b). Drawing from findings in Study 1 and the extant championing \nliterature, I then discussed what factors might inspire or discourage an ally to engage in \nchampioning behaviors, Specifically, I identified three possible moderators that can \ninfluence this relationship: organizational culture, power and status, and the ally’s \nexpectancy beliefs.  \nStudies 1 and 2 showed the importance of employee support for people who \ndiffer from the typical majority and then articulated a multilevel model to understand the \nantecedents of ally support. The next step was to test the assertions found in the \ntheoretical model. Thus, the purpose of Study 3 was to empirically examine the proposed \n 6 \nrelationships. Drawing from the multilevel model in Study 2, I predicted that macro-\nlevel (i.e., marriage equality, media type), meso-level (i.e., sexual orientation diversity, \nsupervisor support, coworker support) and micro-level (i.e., race, sex, openness to \nexperience, extraversion, social justice orientation) factors would be positively \nassociated with attitudes toward sexual minorities. These attitudes were then expected to \npositively relate to championing behaviors. In addition, I expected the organizational \ncommitment to diversity would moderate one’s behavioral support (i.e., championing \nbehaviors) for LGBT-inclusion in the sport organization, such that employees would be \nmore willing to champion LGBT inclusion when their organization displayed a strong \ncommitment to diversity. \nIn sum, this dissertation research explores the antecedents and outcomes \nassociated with employee support for LGBT inclusion. Through three studies, I (a) \ndemonstrate the importance of, and factors related to, employee support for sexual \nminorities working in sport, (b) develop a multilevel theoretical model explaining \nantecedents and outcomes for ally support, and (c) empirically test this model in the \nsport context. The remainder of the dissertation is organized in the following manner. In \nChapters II, I discuss the qualitative analysis from Study 1; in Chapter III, I present the \ntheoretical arguments from Studies 2; and, in Chapter IV I report the findings from \nStudy 3. Finally, in Chapter V, I provide a general discussion of the three studies, \ndiscuss contributions and offer practical implications of the findings, discuss limitations \nof the research, and suggest areas of future research.   \n 7 \nCHAPTER II \nWHO ARE THE CHAMPIONS?  \nUSING A MULTILEVEL MODEL TO EXAMINE EMPLOYEE PERCEPTIONS OF \nSUPPORT FOR LGBT INCLUSION IN SPORT ORGANIZATIONS \n \nIndividuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) continue to \nface prejudice and discrimination in the workplace (Sartore & Cunningham, 2010; \nRagins, 2008). According to Ragins, Singh, and Cornwell (2007), nearly 40 percent of \nemployees who are LGBT report facing some form of hostility or harassment while at \nwork, and almost one out of 10 LGBT individuals state they have been dismissed \nunfairly, or pressured to voluntarily resign from their position, because of their sexual \norientation. In addition, nearly three quarters of heterosexual employees believe LGBT \npeople are the most likely minority group to experience discrimination (i.e., termination, \nharassment, denied promotion) in the workplace (Ragins et al., 2007).  \nInstances of sexual prejudice in the workplace are especially apparent in sport \norganizations. For instance, Krane and Barber’s (2005) qualitative analysis revealed how \nlesbian coaches continuously encounter heterosexist work environments and feel forced \nto conceal their sexual orientation as a way to escape the negative consequences of being \nlabeled a lesbian in sport. This negative treatment is not isolated to lesbian coaches, as \nrecent investigations report similar findings among gay men (Cavalier, 2011) and \nheterosexual women presumed to be lesbian who work in sport organizations (Sartore & \nCunningham, 2010). The effects of such treatment can be immense: LGBT employees \n 8 \nwho work in unsupportive work environments report experiencing greater work-related \nstress, lower job satisfaction, decreased organizational commitment, and increased \nemployee withdrawal behaviors (Garnets & Herek, 2007; Hammer, Bauer, & Grandey, \n2003; Ragins, 2008).  \nTo circumvent these negative outcomes and ensure LGBT employees feel \nwelcomed in the workplace, much research now focuses on how organizations can create \na more inclusive work environment for sexual minorities (Griffith & Hebl, 2002; \nHuffman, Watrous, & King, 20008; Martinez & Hebl, 2010; Ragins, 2008). This work \nhas primarily investigated how organizational policies, such as statements prohibiting \ndiscrimination, the provision of domestic partner benefits, offering diversity training that \nfocus on LGBT issues, or establishing networking opportunities for LGBT employees, \ninfluence LGBT employees’ experiences. For example, research suggests sexual \nminorities are more likely to disclose their sexual orientation at work when organizations \nhave such policies, which can then lead to higher job satisfaction and lower job anxiety \namong LGBT employees (Griffith & Hebl, 2002). In addition, Button’s (2001) work \ndemonstrated that the more prevalent these policies, the less likely it will be that sexual \nminorities experience treatment discrimination. Button also observed that equitable \ntreatment was associated with higher levels of overall job satisfaction and organizational \ncommitment.  \nHaving such policies can also positively relate to organizational outcomes. For \ninstance, Cunningham (2011b) examined performance outcomes related to sexual \norientation diversity in NCAA Division I athletic programs. In his study, athletic \n 9 \ndepartments that combined high sexual orientation diversity with a proactive diversity \nstrategy (i.e., a strategy that values diversity and emphasizes inclusion) were able to \nsignificantly outperform other programs—in fact, some programs earned almost seven \ntimes the NACDA (National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics) cup \npoints—a competition that honors institution for achieving success in many sports—of \ntheir peers. In a follow-up study conducted by Cunningham (2011a) with NCAA \nDivision III athletic departments, he found that high sexual orientation diversity \npositively related to a creative work environment when the organization had a strong \ncommitment to diversity. Of particular interest, the least creative work environments \nwere characterized by high sexual orientation diversity and low commitment to \ndiversity. Thus, these studies provide empirical evidence of how sexual orientation \ndiversity can substantially improve organizational performance, but only in a context \nthat values diversity and inclusion. \nCunningham’s work is noteworthy for several reasons. First, the results provide \nclear, empirical evidence of how sexual orientation diversity can substantially improve \norganizational outcomes. Second, in both studies the impressive gains were only realized \nwhen the organization valued diversity and inclusion—further highlighting the \nimportance of context. Considering the advantages of sexual orientation diversity are \nmost likely to materialize when work environments fully include sexual minorities, there \nis a need to examine what factors create this type of work environment. \nAlthough a number of empirical studies examine reasons for and outcomes of \norganizational support for diversity, a limited amount of research examines why \n 10 \nindividual employees support or oppose inclusive policies or practices. This is an \nunfortunate omission for several reasons. First, employee support is vital to the success \nof diversity initiatives (Avery, 2011). For instance, when employees or supervisors do \nnot show support for LGBT-inclusive practices, many of the benefits gained by offering \nformal forms of organizational support are lost (Griffith & Hebl, 2002). Second, research \nsuggests the attitudes and actions of employees can effectively create more inclusive \nwork environments and can be a tremendous source of support for sexual minorities—\neven in the absence of formal, organizational support. In fact, athletes in Fink et al.’s \n(2012) study expressed how having even one supportive teammate, coach, or \nadministrator made a considerable difference in how they dealt with their identify \ndisclosure experience. Collectively, the aforementioned research suggests employee \nsupport is one of the key determinants in creating and sustaining inclusive work \nenvironments; however, limited research has examined the causes and consequences of \nthis form of support. \n  Thus, the purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the characteristics \nof employees who are more or less likely to endorse and advocate for LGBT \ninclusiveness. In doing so, I adopt a systems perspective, which recognizes that \nemployee behaviors are shaped by multiple factors at various levels of analysis \n(Chelladurai, 2009). By adopting such a perspective, I gain a more complete \nunderstanding of how individuals can both shape and be shaped by their sport \nenvironment (cf. Cunningham, 2010a)—other diversity researchers have also \ndemonstrated the efficacy of adopting a systems approach to understanding diversity-\n 11 \nrelated phenomena (e.g., Bruening  & Dixon, 2007; Cunningham, 2010b; Dixon & \nBruening, 2007). Thus, I adopted a systems theory approach to develop an overall \npicture of how factors at the micro- (i.e., individual forces) and meso- (i.e., \norganizational and group forces) levels of analysis influence an individual’s level of \nsupport for LGBT inclusiveness. In the following sections, I present the conceptual \nframework used to guide the investigation (see Figure 1 for an illustrative summary).  \nConceptual Framework \nEmployee Support for Diversity  \nAccording to Herscovitch and Meyer (2002) employee behavioral support for \ndifferent organizational initiatives can take one of two forms: focal or discretionary. \nWith respect to the first form, focal behaviors are those to which the employee is \nobligated to perform based on her or his employment and association with the company. \nHerscovitch and Meyer (2002) term focal behaviors of support for organizational \ninitiatives as compliance, whereas employee efforts that fail to provide such obligatory \nsupport are described as resistance.   \nContrasting focal behaviors, discretionary behaviors represent actions taken by \nemployees that go above and beyond what is expected or required by the organization. \nDiscretionary behaviors may take the form of cooperation, in which the employee \naccepts the merits of the initiative and makes modest sacrifices to ensure its success. \nHowever, championing behaviors occur when an employee’s efforts require \nconsiderable personal sacrifice, or are intended to encourage others inside and outside \nthe organization to realize the value of the initiative (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002).  \n 12 \nBy many accounts, championing is considered the ideal form of discretionary \nbehavior because it is the most effective behavior in terms of gathering employee \nsupport for organizational initiatives (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002). Champions truly \nembrace the change and work toward persuading others of its merits, even when the \ninitiative is considered unpopular. Particularly relevant to the current study, Zitek and \nHebl (2007) observed that individuals who openly support LGBT equality and \ninclusiveness are particularly effective in persuading peers to also express inclusive \nbeliefs. The results in their study suggest employees can act in powerful ways to \nsuccessfully improve the work experiences of persons who are LGBT, even when \norganizations lack formal policies that protect LGBT rights (cf. Martinez & Hebl, 2010).  \nAs evidenced by this research, championing behaviors exhibited by employees is \nkey to creating inclusive work environments for sexual minorities and, therefore, serve \nas the primary interest in the current study. However, several factors can influence \nwhether a person engages in champion behaviors. Thus, in the next section, I outline the \nmicro- and meso-level forces that may impact championing behaviors among \nemployees.  \nMicro-Level factors \n Micro-level forces that may influence employee level support for LGBT-\ninclusiveness are those that are unique to the individual. In this study, I focused on three \nindividual-level factors: personal demographics, personality, and personal experiences \nwith sexual minorities.    \n 13 \nDemographics. Demographic characteristics such as gender, religious affiliation, \nand level of education oftentimes relate to attitudes toward LGBT individuals (see \nHerek, 2009). According to national surveys, fieldwork, and laboratory experiments, \nnegative attitudes toward sexual minorities consistently correlates with several \ndemographic characteristics. Specifically, those who express sexual prejudice are more \nlikely to be male, older, less educated, hold fundamentalist or conservative religious \nbeliefs, and describe themselves as politically conservative (Herek, 2009).  \n These trends have implications for the current study. Specifically, it is reasonable \nto assume that those who hold negative attitudes toward sexual minorities will be less \nprone to actively support LGBT-inclusive policies and practices in the workplace. \nFurthermore, those who do not share these characteristics may be more inclined to \nsupport LGBT-inclusiveness. Such reasoning is consistent with research that suggests \nwomen and those who have more liberal political leanings generally support LGBT \nrights, such as marriage equality (Herek, 2009; Vescio & Biernat, 2003).    \n Personality. Personality may also influence one’s support for LGBT-\ninclusiveness. The five-factor model of personality suggests one’s personality is best \nconceptualized as consisting of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, \nemotional stability, and openness to experience (see McCrae & Costa, 1996). Of \nparticular interest to this study are extraversion and openness to experience. According \nto Mount & Barrick (1995), extroverts are perceived to be ―sociable, gregarious, \ntalkative, assertive, adventurous, active, energetic, and ambitious‖ (p. 165). Research \nsuggests that people who possess this type of personality are more likely to emerge as \n 14 \nleaders within a group (Judge, Bono, Ilies, & Gerhardt, 2002), and can effectively \ninfluence the opinions of others. Additionally, researchers have observed extraversion is \nstrongly associated with one’s propensity to engage in behaviors that champion diversity \ninitiatives (Cunningham & Sartore, 2010).  \n Openness to experience might also influence’s one support for LGBT inclusion \nin the workplace. Individuals with this personality characteristic are more willing to \nconsider perspectives that differ from their own and tend to make adjustment to existing \nattitudes or behaviors when they are introduced to new ideas or situations (Flynn, 2005). \nFurther, they tend to be more creative, cultured, open-minded, intelligent, curious, and \nimaginative. These individuals tend to become leaders within group settings and are \nsuccessful in convincing others to realize the value in certain initiatives (Judge et al., \n2002).  Most importantly, individuals with an open mind generally show less prejudice \nattitudes toward minority group members (Flynn 2005). \n Contact with LGBT individuals. A considerable amount of research has shown \ncontact with individuals who are LGBT is associated with reduced instances of sexual \nprejudice. These researchers primarily draw from Allport’s (1954) contact hypothesis, \nwhich contends contact with dissimilar others will reduce the prejudice and \ndiscrimination. For instance, in their longitudinal study of American adults, Herek and \nCapitanio’s (1996) discovered sexual prejudice was significantly lower for individuals \nwho had extended contact with LGBT individuals and who had friends who had \ndisclosed their sexual orientation to the participant. In addition, results from Pettigrew \nand Tropp’s (2006) meta-analysis showed heterosexuals’ contact with sexual minorities \n 15 \nwas negatively associated with sexual prejudice. Given these findings, it is reasonable to \nassume contact may increase the likelihood that one will support practices that are \nLGBT inclusive—though limited research has examined if contact will influence overt \nforms of support for inclusion.   \nMeso-Level Factors \n Research also suggests various meso-level factors can influence employees \nsupport for inclusiveness. These forces are observed at the organizational- or group-level \nof analysis and can include organizational culture for diversity and the support of others \nin the workplace.  \n Organizational culture for diversity. Organizational culture refers to the \npattern of shared values, beliefs, and norms that organizational members develop over \ntime (Schein, 1990). In most instances, the organization’s culture will dictate employee \nbehaviors and serve as a model for newcomers to know what is appropriate conduct in \nthe workplace. Several researchers have examined the impact of culture in regards to \ndiversity and inclusion initiatives in sport organizations (Doherty & Chelladurai, 1999; \nFink & Pastore, 1999). This literature suggests that when diversity is not valued in the \nworkplace, the organization’s culture will revolve around the norms and preferences of \nthose who have traditionally held leadership positions in sport organizations—\nspecifically, White, heterosexual, males.  Thus, persons working in an inclusive culture \nmight be more willing to express support for sexual minorities.  \nSupport of others. Leaders and coworkers can play a vital role in creating \ninclusive work environments for individuals who are LGBT. Their attitudes, behaviors, \n 16 \nand policies they support establish a model for others to follow in the organization. \nBandura (1986), in presenting his social learning theory, noted, ―virtually all learning \nphenomena, resulting from direct experience, can occur vicariously by observing other \npeople’s behaviors and the consequences for them‖ (p. 19). Thus, when a leader or \ncoworker expresses explicit or implicit negative attitudes toward sexual minorities, it is \nlikely that others in the organization will, as well.  \nSeveral theoretical and empirical arguments have advanced this idea. For \ninstance, research suggests leaders can inspire coworkers to champion diversity \ninitiatives (Cunningham & Sartore, 2010) and also discourage them from exhibiting \nprejudice (Umphress, Simmons, Boswell, & Triana, 2008). As one example, in \nUmphress et al.’s (2008) study, even when employees held prejudice attitudes, they do \nnot act in discriminatory ways when specifically instructed by their supervisors not to do \nso. The influence of coworkers can act in similar ways, as Cunningham and Sartore \n(2010) observed that employees were more likely to champion diversity initiatives when \nthey perceived their coworkers showed high levels of support for diversity. In addition, \ncoworker support can be especially important if employees are dissatisfied with the \norganizational practices. For instance, Zhou and George (2001) found employees were \nmore likely to voice their frustration and suggest improvements to organizational polices \nwhen the amount of perceived coworker support was high. In this vein, employees who \noppose non-inclusive behaviors may be willing to speak out against discriminatory \nactions if they believe others in the organization share their concerns. \nIn sum, the framework presented above is one that uses a systems approach to \n 17 \nexplore the various factors that may influence employee support for LGBT-inclusion in \nthe workplace. Specifically, micro-level (demographics, personality, contact with LGBT \nindividuals), and meso-level (organizational culture for diversity, support of others) \nfactors are thought to enhance or deter one’s endorsement of inclusive policies and \npractices. This model helped guide the current investigation, which examined the \ncharacteristics of inclusive work environments. The views expressed by the participants \nassisted in answering the following research questions:  \nRQ1: What are the individual-level characteristics of employees who support \nLGBT- inclusion in the workplace? \nRQ2: What organizational-level factors influence LGBT-inclusion in the \nworkplace? \nRQ3: How can sport organizations create more inclusive work environments for \nLGBT  employees? \nMethod \nCase Study Approach \n A multimethod, qualitative approach was appropriate in this study to garner a \ngreater understanding of the employees' perception of inclusion. This involved using \nparticipant observation, interviews, and analysis of secondary documents to investigate \nthe particular case. Adopting the case study method allowed me to develop a more \ncomplete understanding \n 18 \nof the phenomena (i.e., support for LGBT-inclusion), while also enabling the \ndistinctiveness of the participants and the context to be taken into account during the \nresearch process (Flyvbjerg, 2006). \nResearch Setting \n This research took place at a large, public university in the United States. Over \nthe past ten years, the university has recognized its responsibility to create and maintain \na climate that affirms diversity of all persons as well as diversity in views. As such, the \nuniversity has made considerable efforts with respect to increasing the diversity of the \nstudent body and faculty. And, while the school has made vast improvements in terms of \nracial and gender diversity, they still struggle to create a campus environment that is \nwelcoming for individuals who are LGBT. \n In order to provide a more inclusive atmosphere on campus, the university has \nimplemented several programs to support LGBT students, faculty, and staff. For \nexample, there is now an LGBT resources center, which ―educates all campus and \ncommunity constituencies on LGBT issues through programming about sexual \norientation and gender identity/expression, advocacy, leadership, and visibility.‖ In \naddition to providing a ―safe space‖ on campus for persons who are LGBT, the center \nalso works with other student organizations, departments on campus, and local \ncommunity organizations to ensure students have access to a number of resources, \nactivities, and support services. There are also two social organizations, one for students \nand one for faculty and staff, which offers LGBT individuals an opportunity to form \nconnections and relationships with similar others on campus.  Finally, the university also \n 19 \nsupports an ―ally‖ group that is composed of students, faculty and staff, and community \nmembers who are willing to provide support for LGBT people or others dealing with \nsexual orientation issues. Despite these advances, the university continues to rank as one \nof the most unsupportive campuses for sexual monitories.  \n In terms of LGBT inclusive polices within the athletic department, there is a \nformal statement that reads ―no athlete or athletic department staff member will be \ndiscriminated on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, \ndisability, veterans’ or marital status, sexual orientation, or any other protected group \nstatus‖. Also, a new committee has recently been formed to address ways the athletic \ndepartment may better serve the needs of athletes who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual. \nHowever, according to participant accounts, the athletic department as a whole has done \nlittle to promote LGBT inclusiveness, and none of the participants felt they could freely \nexpress their sexual orientation to everyone in the department.  \nParticipants   \n I conducted interviews with 13 athletic department coaches and staff who worked \nin a variety of departmental units. The participants were mostly female (53.8%), White \n(84.6%), and had earned an advanced degree (57.2%). They ranged in age from 25 to 43 \nyears (M = 31.49; SD = 5.46) and had all worked in the athletic department for a \nsignificant amount of time (M = 5.32; SD = 2.87). Nine of the participants were in \ncommitted relationships and four were single. They identified as lesbian (n = 7), gay (n \n= 5), or bisexual (n = 1). All of the employees had disclosed their sexual orientation to at \nleast one other staff member. To respect the participants’ concern for anonymity, \n 20 \npseudonyms (chosen by the participants) are used and specific job titles and tenure are \nnot presented.  \nProcedures \nParticipants were recruited through a modified snowball sampling method \n(Taylor & Bogdan, 1998). Specifically, I contacted individuals I knew met the selection \ncriteria for the study and asked if they would be willing to participate. To be considered \nfor the study, participants must (a) identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, and \n(b) work within the athletic department. The individuals identified were then emailed a \nletter describing the purpose of the study. The letter explained exactly what would be \nrequired of the participants and stated the Human Subject Review Board had reviewed \nand approved the investigation. Those who were interested were instructed to contact the \nresearcher, and to also provide names of other individuals they knew who met the \nparticipant selection criteria and would be willing to participate. In sum, 13 people were \nwilling to participate in the study, and subsequent face-to-face interviews were \nscheduled. All interviews were between 60 and 90 minutes in length. In order to ensure a \nsafe, comfortable space for the participant, all interviews were conducted at an off-\ncampus location chosen by the participant.  \nInterview Guide \nThe interview guide was developed with the intent of capturing the participants’ \nperceptions and experiences regarding LGBT inclusion in the workplace. Specifically, I \nsought to understand what inclusion meant to LGBT employees, their personal \nexperiences with individuals who had made them feel included in the workplace, and \n 21 \ntheir perception of who and how individuals made the workplace more LGBT \ninclusiveness. The conceptual framework used to guide this study informed the \nquestions regarding employee support for inclusion (see Figure 1). Questions either \npertained directly to the framework (e.g., Can you describe the characteristics of \nindividuals who support LGBT inclusion at work?), or were framed in a more general \nway (e.g., How do you define inclusion? Have you experienced an inclusive workplace? \nIf so, can you describe it?). The latter approach was taken in order to elicit responses that \ncould provide more understanding and insight regarding employee support for LGBT \ninclusiveness (cf. Kvale, 1996). Taking this approach allowed me to extend beyond the \npreconceived theoretical image of the employee support, and develop a sense of how the \nsocial world appeared to those under investigation (Patton, 1987). The final interview \nguide consisted of questions regarding perceptions of employee support from the \nparticipant’s perspective (e.g., What does employee support mean to you? When do you \nfeel supported by your coworkers? Do your coworkers or supervisors support LGBT \ninclusion? Which coworkers are more likely to support LGBT inclusion? What \nbehaviors are more or less successful in creating a more inclusive work environment? \nWhy do you think some employees support LGBT inclusion and others do not?). \nData Analysis \nInterviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. NVivo 9 was used \nto store the data and assist with analysis. Complete Word file transcripts were imported \ninto NVivo where free nodes (cf. open coding, Strauss & Corbin, 1990) were used to \ncategorize portions of text. Once free nodes (n = 53) were created, they were then \n 22 \ngrouped into 12 trees (cf. axial coding, Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Using the concepts in \nthe theoretical framework as a guide, all tree concepts were subjected to a visual \ninspection by the author and were combined to develop higher order themes. Such an \napproach is consistent with an a priori, content- specific approach to data analysis \n(Schwandt, 2007), in which codes are ―developed from careful study of the problem or \ntopic under investigation and the theoretical interests that drive the inquiry‖ (p. 32). If a \nhigher order theme did not appear in the theoretical framework, the decision to include it \nin the findings was made according to the frequency of occurrence in the data.  The \nfindings and discussion are presented in the following section.  \n Finally, several steps were taken to improve credibility and trustworthiness of the \nresearch findings. First, considering limited research examines employee support for \nLGBT inclusive policies, two scholars who research LGBT issues served as my peer \ndebriefers. The advice they provided was quite valuable when I originally developed the \ntheoretical framework for this study. Also, their knowledge and expertise enhanced the \ndependability of the interview guide and helped create interview questions that (a) \nreflected the theoretical framework and (b) also made it possible to capture the unique \nexperiences of the participants. Second, to monitor my personal positions and potential \nbias, I recorded notes in a reflexive journal throughout the investigation. This allowed \nme to remain cognizant of when the interviewee’s words differed from (a) my \npreconceived impressions of support, and (b) previous research that has examined \nemployee support for inclusion. Finally, to improve credibility, participants were sent a \n 23 \ncopy of the transcript and given the opportunity to provide clarity and ensure their words \nand experiences were portrayed accurately. \nFindings and Discussion \n Employee support for LGBT-inclusive policies and practices is instrumental in \ncreating a more accepting and inclusive work environments for sexual minorities \n(Griffith & Hebl, 2002; Martinez & Hebl, 2010; Ragins, 2008). Coworkers can provide \nneeded assurance and affirmation during the coming out process (Ragins, 2008), create \nsafe havens where LGBT employees feel free to express their sexual identity (Ragins, \n2004; Fink et al., in press), and become vocal advocates for LGBT equality in the \nworkplace (Martinez & Hebl, 2010; Russell, 2011). Results from this study certainly \ndemonstrate the employees’ perceptions regarding the benefits of this type of support; \nhowever, and of equal importance, they also highlight the perceived forces that influence \nwhether a sport employee will support or resist LGBT inclusion in the workplace. \nHigher order themes pertaining to employee support include: (a) definition of \ninclusiveness, (b) micro-level factors for employee support, (c) meso-level factors from \nemployee support, (d) power and status, and (e) friends versus champions of inclusion. \nEach of these is described in further detail below (see Figure 1 for an illustrative \nsummary).  \nDefinition of Inclusiveness  \n According to workplace inclusion literature (Shore et al., 2011; Ely & Thomas, \n2001), diverse employees feel accepted and included when their needs for belongingness \nand uniqueness are satisfied in by their membership in the work group. Consistent with \n 24 \nthis view, when asked how they would describe inclusion in the workplace, all of the \nparticipants discussed needing to feel as though they belonged in the work group, were \naccepted by others, and received equal treatment.  However, only two of the participants \nfelt their sexual orientation needed to be viewed as unique in order to create accepting \nwork atmospheres. In fact, many times the participants’ definitions stated how one’s \nsexual orientation should not be significant. For instance, when describing inclusive \nwork groups, John noted ―for me, the department is inclusive when people don’t care if \nyour gay or not. It’s just a non-issue.‖ Jimmy desired a somewhat more affirming \nenvironment, but still did not believe the organization needed to value sexual orientation \ndiversity. Rather, he simply wanted to be treated in the same way heterosexual \nemployees were treated.    \nI just want my coworkers and the athletic department to be okay with me being \ngay, and show that it’s okay that I’m gay. Give domestic partner insurance \nbenefits, let my boyfriend go on the ―spouse‖ away game trip with me. I don’t \nthink they need a gay appreciation day at work or something like that. Just give \nme the same rights and luxuries that my straight coworkers have.  \nIn many respects, these participants may not have seen their sexual orientation as a \nvalued characteristic because they had never worked in organizations that effectively \ncommunicated the value of diversity. This might help explain why having diverse \nemployees does not automatically translate into performance gains (Cunningham, 2011a, \n2011b). For instance, employees may be unable to effectively utilize the advantages of \nhaving diversity because they (minority and majority group members) do not realize \n 25 \nhow diversity can enhance organizational outcomes (for similar arguments, see Doherty \n& Chelladurai, 1999).   \n Given that many of the participants had never worked in an athletic department \nwith formal LGBT-inclusive polices, participants assessed the attitudes and actions of \nsupportive coworkers and supervisors to determine the level of inclusiveness in the \norganization. For example, Tanya believed the department was inclusive if individuals \nshowed explicit or implicit signs of acceptance.  \nI was really worried before my interview that I wouldn’t fit it. I knew about the \nculture here and knew it wasn’t exactly gay-friendly…  When I came on my \ninterview everyone was great, they were really nice and didn’t say any over-the-\ntop homophobic comments (laughs). And I noticed one of the (specific job title) \nhad an ally sticker on her door. So I knew there was at least one person who \nsupported gays and lesbians.  \nTanya’s concluding comment suggests the presence of just one LGBT support can make \na significant impact regarding whether LGBT individuals feel included in the sport \nsetting.  \nMicro-Level Factors \n In order to gain a better understanding of which individuals were perceived to be \nmore likely to support LGBT inclusion, I asked participants to describe people who were \nsupportive or accepting of LGBT people or who acted as allies in the workplace. For the \npurposes of this investigation, an ally was described as an individual who, regardless of \nsexual orientation, advocated for LGBT rights and equality.  Though perhaps surprising, \n 26 \nall of the participants had received support, to varying degrees, from their coworkers—\neven though the athletic department made very few attempts to incorporate LGBT issues \ninto their diversity strategy. When asked what qualities these individuals displayed, the \nparticipants discussed a variety of micro-level factors, including personality, \ndemographic characteristics, and coworkers’ past experiences with sexual minorities.  \n Demographics. Overall, employees who supported LGBT inclusiveness at State \nUniversity tended to be female, raised in progressive areas of the country, and politically \nliberal. In fact, as the participants recounted instances when coworkers had been \nparticularly supportive of sexual minorities, 23 different women were identified as being \nsupportive of LGBT issues in the athletic department, but only four men were \nmentioned. When asked why she felt women were more understanding of LGBT issues, \nBlakely expressed, ―I think women are just more comfortable with it (one’s LGBT \nsexual identity).‖ Women were particularly more supportive if the participant was a gay \nmale, as opposed to a lesbian. As John describes \nFor the most part, all the women I work with are totally fine with me being gay. \nThey think nothing of it. Some of the men have a problem with it, or I think they \nthink I shouldn’t be so open with it or something like that.  \nIn addition to women, the participants also mentioned coworkers who were liberal or \nwho were from areas that were more progressive tended to behave in ways that created a \nmore inclusive work environment. As Mia explains \nThe allies I know are all liberal or they grew up in a liberal part of the country… \nLike Paige, she grew up in California, she’s like your typical tree-hugging \n 27 \nliberal, supports Obama, just a huge Democrat… The other day we were all at \nlunch and someone brought up Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell and said they thought it \nwas good and needed to stay… When he said it, Paige immediately jumped on \nher soapbox and told the guy how gay marriage should be legal and how gays \nand lesbians should have the same rights as straight people… Then, our boss, \nwho served in the military but has never said anything about Don’t Ask Don’t \nTell, chimed in and said it should be repealed and it’s a stupid policy. \nPaige’s reaction is significant for two reasons. First, she instantly responded to a \ncoworker who voiced support for a policy that has now been deemed discriminatory and \noverturned by the federal government—setting an example for how to support LGBT \ninclusion. Second, by publically rebuking her coworker, she also inspired their \nsupervisor to express his support for LGBT equality.  \nUnfortunately, when employees do not take a stand, instances of sexual prejudice \nmay persist in the workplace. As an illustrative example, Ryan, who does not work in \nPaige’s department, explained how two of her coworkers perpetuated a non-inclusive \nwork atmosphere by saying disparaging comments.  \nEveryone is relatively accepting, but we have like one or two ultra-conservatives \nthat just seem to ruin it. Like the least offensive thing they’ll say is someone or \nsomething is so gay. But I’ve heard them call other (heterosexual) coworkers \nqueers or fags… They’ve both said you don’t want to work with certain women’s \nteams because you’ll just be around lesbians, and girls shouldn’t go pro because \nthey’ll be around so many (lesbians)… or worse, they’ll try to turn the girl into a \n 28 \nlesbian… I can’t believe anyone would ever say that at work, like no matter how \nyou feel about homosexuality. But no one says anything so they just keep saying \nthat stuff.   \n Personality. As previously articulated in the theoretical framework, extraversion \nand openness to experience have been empirically linked to employee support for \ndiversity in the work context. However, few researchers have examined if personality \nrelates to support for LGBT inclusiveness. In the current study, all of the participants \ndescribed supportive employees as ―having an open mind‖ or being ―open-minded‖, \nwhich is consistent with previous research examining individual support policies that \nensure LGBT equality (Fynn, 2005). Participants further explained how being open-\nminded and accepting differed from being tolerant of homosexuality, in that the open-\nminded individuals they encountered at work did not view homosexuality as a sin or has \na conscious choice. As Sarah noted, \nPeople who are open-mined are more accepting of gays and lesbians. They don’t \njudge you. They’re open to the possibility that people are just gay, we don’t \nchoose to be gay.  \nContrary to arguments proposed in the conceptual framework, none of the participants \nmentioned extroversion where describing individual characteristics of employees who \nsupport LGBT inclusion. Instead, the participants described how supportive employees \nwere confident, not only in themselves but also in the message they were sending by \nbeing an advocate for LGBT rights. When discussing one of her coworkers that acted as \nan ally at work, Jen explained, \n 29 \nLori is just a really confident, assertive person. I think you have to be, especially \nhere. It’s never popular to tell someone they’re discriminating against someone \nelse.  \nTanya expressed similar sentiments regarding the personal characteristics of an ally, \n―It’s a controversial issue. You have to be pretty sure of yourself and believe in what \nyou’re saying to make a difference.‖    \n Experiences with LGBT individuals. Research examining the motivations of \nheterosexual allies suggests many people advocate for LGBT individuals because they \nhave a family member or close friend who is LGBT (Russell, 2011). Consistent with \nthese examinations, participants in the current study revealed how a person’s \nexperiences or relationships with LGBT individuals may influence her or his willingness \nto support LGBT equality. Perhaps more interesting, several participants believed their \ncoworkers became allies after they developed a friendship with the participant and later \ndiscovered he or she was LGBT. As Marisa explains, \nI’d say James was completely homophobic before he met me. He thought gays \nwere gross, weird, against God, just not acceptable. But, he didn’t know any gay \npeople… After we worked together for a year or so, he still didn’t think he knew \nany gay people (laughs)… If he ever said anything homophobic I challenged him \non it, and he eventually started to come around… Finally I got the courage to tell \nhim I was gay. And when I did, he was completely supportive, which was really \nsurprising… Now he’s my biggest ally. He goes after anyone who says anything \nthe least bit homophobic.  \n 30 \nThis example points to how important it is for sexual minorities to disclose their sexual \norientation in the work place. Without learning that his coworker was lesbian, James \nmay have never become an advocate for LGBT equality and inclusion.  \nMeso-level Factors \n Culture of diversity. According to Doherty and Chelladurai (1999), \norganizations with a culture of diversity focus on people and respect the differences their \nemployees bring to the organization. This culture encourages managers to have a greater \ntolerance for risk and ambiguity, which in turn gives employees the freedom and \nflexibility to develop new and innovative ways to accomplish tasks.  This environment \ncontains open lines of communication, multilevel decision-making systems, and open \ngroup membership. In contrast, a culture of similarity views differences as deficits or a \nsource of conflict that will inevitably limit productivity and performance. Consequently, \nthese organizations have closed lines of communication, one-sided decision-making \nsystems, and closed group membership. Managers and employees working within a rigid \nculture of similarity are typically task versus people oriented, avoid risk and conflict, and \nrely on traditional modes of operation when making business decisions.     \n According to the participants’ perceptions, diversity was seen as a means to an \nend, rather than a value. Specifically, they discussed how policies were primarily \nimplemented so that the athletic department could avoid discrimination lawsuits, similar \nto Fink and Pastore’s (1999) description of compliance strategies. For instance, when \nJacob was in the process of interviewing job applicants for a vacant position, an \nassociate athletic director told him that he needed to hire a woman to ensure the athletic \n 31 \ndepartment was not sued for gender discrimination. Those who were interviewed \nperceived that this view of diversity inhibited some people from taking proactive step to \ncreate inclusive work environments. As John notes,  \nThe department might say diversity is important, but they don’t do anything to \nshow it. If they did something, anything really, I think more people would \nsupport LGBT inclusiveness.  \nMegan also expressed how she believed top administrations only viewed diversity as a \nway to attract diverse athletes to the athletic program. \nOur AD doesn’t value diversity; he just knows you have to have it to help \nrecruiting. I think he sees it as a checklist when hiring someone new. If the \nperson is African  American, check. If she’s a woman, check. If you hire an \nAfrican American woman, double check… Gay isn’t on his checklist. If \nanything, if you hire a lesbian assistant coach it’s considered a mark against you.  \nMegan’s words also highlight how, many times, sexual orientation is not a valued \ndiversity dimension in sport. However, some of the smaller units within the athletic \ndepartment did support all forms of diversity and created policies and statements that \nreflected these inclusive beliefs. For example Josh, who works within the compliance \ndepartment, said \nWe created our own mission statement, and it specifically states how we respect \nall types of diversity… We’re just a small department, but we really try to live up \nto that mission in all we do… It shows in our hiring practices, it shows in the \nway we treat student-athletes, and it shows in how we treat each other.   \n 32 \n Support of others in the organization. Huffman (2008) and her colleagues \ndiscuss how supervisors and coworkers can be particularly influential in creating more \ninclusive environments for LGBT employees. In fact, some researchers suggests \nemployees often look to their leaders for cues on how they should act in regards to \ndiversity initiatives (Avery, 2011). This was certainly the case in the current study, as \nparticipants discussed how, in some instances, the behavior of their supervisor inspired \nothers to be more supportive of LGBT inclusion. For instance, Shannon shared events \nthat took place after her coworker was required to attend diversity training for saying \ndisparaging remarks about sexual minorities.  \nI think a lot of good things came out of making Lee attend that diversity \nsensitivity class. For one, it set the tone that you can’t act that way in our \ndepartment. And two, people started to talk about it (issues related to sexual \norientation diversity). For the first time since I had been there, people were \nsaying we needed to think about what we said, and consider how it affected \nothers.   \nIn addition to supervisors, the attitudes and behaviors of coworkers can also significantly \ninfluence employee support for inclusion (Avery, 2011). John discussed how his \ncoworkers, who were also close friends, modeled inclusive behavior for others in the \ndepartment and rebuked anyone who expressed negative attitudes for sexual minorities.  \nIt’s not easy being an out gay guy in (State University’s) athletic department. But \nif a couple of your friends stand up for you, you really don’t have many \nproblems. They’ll tell other folks how it is and how it’s going to be.  \n 33 \nThough not extensively addressed in the support literature, subordinate support for \ninclusion can also impact employee behaviors. Social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) \nhelps explain why a subordinate would engage in behaviors that demonstrate support for \ntheir supervisor. Specifically, if subordinates feel their supervisor is providing them with \nopportunities, resources, emotional social support, etc., they are more likely to \nreciprocate the treatment by showing loyalty to their supervisor. This was certainly the \ncase in the current study. As Taylor describes: \nI think I’m a pretty good boss, but I didn’t know how much my employees liked \nme until last year… A new student-worker had been saying inappropriate gay \njokes and calling people fags. I had heard it, but since everyone knows I’m gay, I \ndidn’t want to be that guy… You know, the one that makes an issue out of being \ngay… Well, I was told that one of my employees over heard it and completely \ntold the guy off. He said he didn’t want to hear those kinds of comments and he \nshould watch what he says and quit sounding like an uneducated idiot.  \nWhen Taylor shared this experience, he believed his subordinate’s loyalty motivated him \nto engage in championing; however, subordinates’ views toward inclusion may be what \nactually inspire them to advocate for LGBT equality. For instance, one of Randi’s top \nplayers had been involuntary ―outed‖ by a teammate and afterwards was harassed and \ntreated unfairly by some of the juniors and seniors on the team. Randi explained how the \nnewer members of the team held more progressive views toward homosexuality and did \nnot tolerate the unsupportive behaviors of others on the team.  \n 34 \nThey confronted the upperclassmen who were being so awful, and told the \ncoaches that we needed to do something to stop what was going on… We held a \nteam meeting with all the players, coaches, and support staff. We made it clear \nthat we were a team and we were going to respect everyone... During the meeting \nthe players set team rules that explained how they would treat their teammates, \ngay or straight. And, everyone agreed to keep each other accountable. The whole \natmosphere on the team changed after that, everyone came together…The players \nwere the ones that made the change. And it really helped me. It made me realize \nthings were getting better and people were becoming more tolerant. It showed me \nthat I had to make sure our team was a place were players felt loved and \naccepted, not hated.  \nThis powerful example illustrates how influential individuals can be with respect to \ncreating inclusive environments for LGBT individuals.  \nFriends versus Champions of LGBT Inclusion \n Analysis of the data revealed employees created more inclusive work \nenvironments for sexual minorities in two ways. First, employees acted as friendly \nsupporters by providing a safe space for sexual minorities at work. Within these \nsupportive spaces, employees felt their sexual identify was respect and affirmed by \nothers in the workplace. These coworkers provided needed social support that alleviate \nvarious stressors that are associated with minority stress (Meyer, 2003). As Heather \nexplains,  \n 35 \nMy coworkers are great. They are completely accepting. They make me feel \nokay to be me… Meredith (Heather’s coworker) really helped me when I came \nout to my parents… After they basically disowned me, Meredith just said I was \nnow part of her family.   \nIn many respects, this form of support is similar to Herscovitch and Meyer’s (2002) \ncooperation behavior, in that the employees made modest sacrifices to support inclusion \ninitiatives. Though these efforts were beneficial in terms of social support and identity \naffirmation, they did not encourage others to create or advocate for formal organizational \npolices related to LGBT-inclusiveness. However, some employees did act as change \nagents by engaging in champion behaviors that persuaded others to express inclusive \nbeliefs.  \nThe participants considered championing behaviors to be imperative to creating \nmore inclusive work environments for LGBT employees. In fact, 12 of the13 employees \ninterviewed stressed the importance of having allies in the workplace. Rachel, who \nworks in women’s athletics, discussed how she felt the sport context was particularly \nheterosexist and desperately needed heterosexual employees to support LGBT \ninclusiveness. In her words, \nThings are starting to improve, but for the most part, it’s just okay to discriminate \nagainst gays and lesbians in sport… Lesbian coaches get fired, and the news runs \nthe story, but in the end, the coach never gets her job back... We need people to \nmake policies that won’t allow the athletic department to fire the coach for being \n 36 \ngay… I can’t do it, heck I might get fired. We need more straight coaches to \nadvocate for anti-discrimination policies.  \nIn many cases, the participants described instances in which they wanted to speak out \nwhen coworkers or supervisors used non-inclusive language or made disparaging \ncomments regarding gays and lesbians, but they felt their minority status inhibited them \nfrom voicing their grievances. Fortunately, their ally coworkers were oftentimes willing \nto take a stand for LGBT-inclusiveness and set an example for what type of behavior \nwas acceptable in the workplace.  \nPower  \n Prior to the beginning the investigation, I expected that employees who held \nattitudinal support for LGBT inclusion would also behave in ways that championed \ninclusive policies in the workplace (i.e., behavioral support for inclusion). However, \nanalysis of the data suggests supportive attitudes did not always related to championing \nbehaviors (see Figure 1). Instead, various factors seemed to influence whether or not a \nperson displayed inclusive behaviors (e.g., speaking out against homophobic or \nheterosexist comments). Specifically, the participants consistently discussed how power \nand status can significantly influenced employee support for inclusion. On a number of \noccasions, they explained how those who held power in the athletic department were in a \nbetter position to advocate for LGBT equality. As one illustrative example, Randi \ndescribed how working in men’s sport might afford one more power. \nA male coach, especially one who is married with three kids, can publically \nsupport gay and lesbian issues. People will listen; they might even applaud him \n 37 \nfor his courage to speak out on a controversial topic. Can a female coach do that? \nHell no. She’s immediately called a lesbian and all the coaches in her conference \nare making sure recruits, and their parents, know she’s lesbian and supports \nlesbianism on the team.  \nConclusion \nChampions can play a key role in creating more welcoming and accepting work \nenvironments for sexual minorities in sport. Based on the perceptions of the participants, \nfindings in this study illustrate that various micro-level (demographics, personality, \nexperiences with LGBT individuals) and meso-level factors (organizational culture for \ndiversity, support of relevant others) influenced the level of employee support for LGBT \ninclusive policies at State University. Furthermore, power significantly influenced these \ndynamics, such that individuals in low status positions within the athletic department \nwere hesitant to vocally support LGBT equality. However, those who did champion \nLGBT inclusive initiatives successfully modeled supportive behaviors and positive \nattitudes toward LGBT individuals, vocally opposed discriminatory treatment, and \nprovided sexual minorities with a safe space at work.  \nThis study makes several contributions to the literature. Perhaps the most \nsignificant is that it is the first to examine employee support for LGBT inclusion within \nthe sport domain. Past theoretical and empirical investigations have primarily focused on \norganizational forms of support, and the outcomes associated with such initiatives. This \nstudy differs from this focus by adopting a multilevel perspective to understand the \nvarious factors that influence employee support. Second, consistent with Martinez and \n 38 \nHebl’s (2010) recommendations, the purpose of this study was to explore how individual \nemployees, rather than organizations, can become champions in creating more inclusive \nwork environments for LGBT individuals.  \nFuture research should examine why employees who hold more powerful \npositions in sport organization choose to champion LGBT-inclusive initiatives. \nSpecifically, research needs to examine what motivates individuals to be supportive of \nLGBT inclusion, what types of contexts encourage support, and what organizational \noutcomes are enhanced when support is provided. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 39 \nCHAPTER III \nA MULTILEVEL MODEL FOR EXAMIINING ALLY SUPPORT  \nIN SPORT ORGANIZATONS \n \nDespite an increased awareness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \n(LGBT) issues in both mainstream sport media and the sport management literature (see \nCunningham, 2011b), heterosexism and instances of sexual prejudice continue to \ndiminish the experiences of LGBT individuals in sport (Cavalier, 2011; Sartore & \nCunningham, 2010). Similar to other forms of prejudice, sexual prejudice is typically \nnegative and characterized by hostility or dislike toward people who are (or perceived to \nbe) LGBT (Herek, 2009). Heterosexism, on the other hand, is defined as ―an ideological \nsystem that denies, denigrates, and stigmatizes any nonheterosexual form of behavior, \nrelationship, or community‖ (Herek, 1990, p. 316). Manifestations of these forms of \nprejudice may include overt instances of violence against sexual minorities, more subtle \nbias, or exclusionary behaviors—all of which have the potential to negatively affect the \npsychological well-being, physical health, and opportunities of individuals who are (or \nare perceived as being) LGBT.  \n Within the sport management literature, enactments of sexual prejudice are \nprevalent in a variety of sport settings. For instance, lesbian coaches and athletes \nfrequently encounter heterosexist environments within women’s sport—compelling \nmany of these women to conceal their sexual identity and portray themselves in ultra-\nfeminine (and thus, presumably heterosexual) manners (Krane 2001; Krane & Barber, \n 40 \n2005). Sadly, disclosing one’s sexual orientation, or failing to appear heterosexual, may \nresult in a number of negative outcomes (Griffith & Hebl, 2002). Specifically, research \nsuggests sexual minorities are oftentimes harassed, negatively stereotyped, and socially \nexcluded in team or work settings—experiences their heterosexual counterparts do not \ntypically encounter (Krane, 1997; Griffin, 1998). Although much of the extant sport \nliterature focuses primarily on athletic settings, empirical examinations of gay sport \nindustry professionals (Cavalier, 2011), and women (presumed to be lesbian) working \nwithin heath and kinesiology departments (Sartore & Cunningham, 2009b, 2010) have \nreported similar findings. Furthermore, expressions of sexual prejudice stem from a \nnumber of sources, including coaches (Melton & Cunningham, in press-c), athletes \n(Anderson, 2005; Sartore & Cunningham, 2009a), parents of athletes (Sartore & \nCunningham, 2009a), athletic administrators and sport employees (Melton & \nCunningham, in press-b, in-press-c), fans (Anderson, 2002), faculty members (Sartore & \nCunningham, 2010), and future sport management professionals (Gill et al., 2006). \nCollectively, these studies point to the urgency of efforts to ensure sport is a more \nwelcoming and supportive place for sexual minorities.  \n Research suggests an effective way to create more inclusive environments is to \nelicit the support of both heterosexual and LGBT allies (Brooks & Edwards, 2009; \nMartinez & Hebl, 2010). Though both groups can inspire change, heterosexual allies \nparticularly are powerful and essential advocates for LGBT equality, as these individuals \ndo not have a stigmatizing identity. As such, they oftentimes have more power and \nprivilege within the workplace, making them effective leaders for change.  The \n 41 \nsupportive attitudes and actions they display not only set an example for appropriate \nbehavior, but can also successfully persuade others to adopt more inclusive mindsets \n(Martinez & Hebl, 2010). Given the potential benefits of ally support (i.e., inclusiveness, \npsychological safety, equality; see Brooks & Edwards, 2009; Martinez & Hebl, 2010), a \ngrowing number of scholars have started to examine individual antecedents and \nmotivations for becoming an ally (Brooks & Edwards, 2009; Fingerhut, 2011; Russell, \n2011). These studies suggest allies tend to have friends or relatives who are LGBT, \nknow other allies, or hold personal beliefs or values that encourage them to defend \nminority rights. While these investigations enhance understanding regarding causes of \nally support, they focus solely on the individual level of analysis. Such a narrow focus \nfails to consider how organizational or societal forces impact individual attitudes and \nbehaviors.  \n Thus, the purpose of this paper is to propose a multilevel theoretical model that \noutlines the antecedents and outcomes of engaging in ally support. Adopting a multilevel \nperspective allows researchers to gain a more complete understanding of how \nindividuals can both shape and be shaped by their environment (Chelladurai, 2009). \nSpecifically, I identify how certain macro- (societal), meso- (organizational or group), \nand micro-level forces influence one’s decision to become an ally. From there, I \nelaborate on the various forms of ally behavior, and finally, identify moderators or \nboundary conditions that may intensify or diminish one’s level of behavioral support for \nLGBT equality and inclusiveness in sport. In the following sections, we provide a brief \ndescription of an ally and various ally behaviors, and then present a multilevel model for \n 42 \nexamining ally support in sport organizations. An illustrative summary of the model is \npresented in Figure 1.  \nDefinition of an Ally \n Allies are heterosexual individuals who make conscious and deliberate attempts \nto support those who are LGBT (Ragins, 2008). These individuals can provide unique \nand needed forms of support for creating more inclusive work environments. \nSpecifically, they can be a source of affirmation and acceptance during the disclosure \nprocess for a particular LGBT individual, such as a friend, relative, or coworker, or they \nmay take a more public role in advocating for the rights of the LGBT community as a \nwhole. Unlike support provided by others who are LGBT, allies do not share the \nstigmatized social identity (Herek, 2009, Ragins, 2008), and thus, the support one \nreceives through these relationships can be particularly helpful in developing a healthier, \nmore confident self-image. Moreover, receiving positive reactions from allies during the \ndisclosure process allows LGBT individuals to realize supportive relationships can \ndevelop, which in turn lessens the fear of disclosing their sexual orientation to others \n(Ragins, 2008). \n In addition to providing social support, allies supply meaningful instrumental \nsupport when they act as strong advocates for LGBT individuals (Martinez & Hebl, \n2010; Ragins, 2008). This form of support involves taking an active stand against \ninstances of sexual prejudice or heterosexist practices. It may include, but is not limited \nto, rebuking coworkers for saying discriminatory comments or jokes, promoting the use \nof inclusive language, encouraging top management to offer domestic partner benefits, \n 43 \nor garnering public support for marriage equality. Considering heterosexual allies do not \nhave a stigmatized sexual orientation, they may have more power and privilege than \nsexual minorities and may therefore be more successful in persuading others to develop \nmore inclusive attitudes and policies (cf. Martinez & Hebl, 2010).  \n Recognizing the prevalence of sexual prejudice and heterosexism in sport, \nseveral prominent sport figures have recently become allies in hopes of making sport \nmore inclusive for individuals who are LGBT. For instance, a number of past and \ncurrent professional athletes (e.g., Charles Barkley, Grant Hill, Steve Nash, Sean Avery, \nScott Fujita, Brendon Ayanbadejo) have publically come out as straight allies, and \nseveral MLB teams have produced ―It Get’s Better‖ videos to show their support. In \naddition to these efforts, recently retired English rugby star Ben Cohen and former \nNCAA wrestling All-American Hudson Taylor have both started their own non-profit \norganizations to combat bullying and LGBT-discrimination in sport (Griffin, 2011).  \n To date, most of the literature on support for LGBT equality in the workplace has \nrecognized the need for ally support, but limited research has examined antecedents of \npositive attitudes toward sexual minorities and what factors facilitate or discourage \npeople from expressing their attitudes in the workplace. This is somewhat surprising \nconsidering the vast amount of scholarly attention devoted to identifying and \nunderstanding the causes and consequences of sexual prejudice (see Herek, 2009). \nPerhaps, scholars have neglected this area of study because of the assumption that low \nprejudice is akin to positive attitudes or support. However, research suggests that even \nlow levels of prejudice can cause one to hold negative views toward LGBT individuals \n 44 \n(Cunningham & Melton, in press-b). These findings further emphasize the importance of \nexamining antecedents and outcomes of having positive attitudes toward sexual \nminorities, or what I term ally support in this paper.   \n Thus, to address this potential gap in the literature, I  present a multilevel model \nthat addresses factors at the macro-level (i.e., mass media, climate for sexual orientation \ndiversity), meso-level (i.e., sexual orientation diversity, presence of other allies), and \nmicro-level (i.e., personality, personal values, contact with LGBT individuals, and \npersonal motivations) that influence one’s level of ally support. In addition, I \ndifferentiate between attitudinal and behavioral expressions of ally support, and discuss \nvarious factors that may encourage allies to express their support more publically.  \nA Multilevel Model to Explain Ally Support \nMacro-Level Factors \nMacro-level antecedents of ally support are elements that are external to a \nspecific sport organization or team, but may still exert considerable influence on \nindividual attitudes within these contexts. Below, I discuss two macro-level factors that \nmay influence ally support: mass media and the community climate for sexual \norientation diversity.  \nMass media. Various forms of media, such as television, social media, radio, \nprint, and the Internet, significantly influence individuals, and society as a whole. In fact, \nresearch suggests the media is ―one of the most powerful institutional forces for shaping \nvalues and attitudes in modern culture‖ (Kane, 1988, p. 89).  The images and themes \npromoted in the media can—explicitly and implicitly—influence one’s feelings toward \n 45 \nvarious subjects, change how one thinks, and even shape people’s views concerning \nsexuality (Coakley, 2009; Melton, 2010). \n The media have influenced ally support in a number of ways. First, although \nviolence and harassment of LGBT individuals is not a new phenomenon, the media \nbrought national attention to the issue in 2010 by reporting the shocking number of \nsuicides among LGBT (or persons presumed to be LGBT) children and teenagers who \nhad been bullied by their classmates (e.g., Justin Aaberg, Asher Brown, Tyler Clementi, \nJamie Hubley, Billy Lucas, Jamey Rodemeyer). What was equally tragic in these \naccounts was the realization that the victims felt helpless and alone. School \nadministrators and teachers did little, if anything, to prevent the abuse and failed to \nprovide a safe learning environment for these students (McKinley, 2010). Learning this \ndevastating news, several parents, teachers, student, and elected officials changed their \nviews concerning bullying and the need to end anti-LGBT violence.  \nThe media also gave people a way to voice their support for LGBT individuals. \nSpecifically, through the ―It Get’s Better Project,‖ individuals uploaded personal \nYouTube video messages to remind young LGBT people that they were not alone, and \nshow them they could, and would, experience tremendous happiness, joy, and fulfillment \nin life. After just a year of its existence, the ―It Get’s Better Project‖ has inspired over \n30,000 personal videos, which have been viewed more than 40 million times \n(www.itgetsbetter.org). Furthermore, the movement has recently inspired several \nathletes, and professional sports teams to create YouTube videos in support of LGBT \ninclusion. For example, the San Francisco Giants used their ―It Gets Better Video‖ to \n 46 \nreach audiences who may not realize the harm of heterosexist or homophobic behaviors, \nand to unite people who support LGBT inclusion.  Soon after the Giants released their \nvideo, the Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays, Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, \nChicago Cubs made similar videos supporting LGBT equality and inclusion. As is \nillustrated by these examples, the media can greatly influences people’s perception of \nLGBT issues, which may then inspire them to act as allies. Thus, I propose: \nProposition 1: Exposure to positive media messages regarding LGBT inclusion \nwill positively associate with attitudes toward sexual minorities.      \nCommunity climate. Another macro-level factor that may positively influence \nally support is the community’s climate for sexual orientation diversity. Drawing from \nKossek and Zonia’s (1993) concept of diversity climate, sexual orientation diversity \nclimate refers to an individual’s perceptions of how sexual minorities are treated in a \ngiven social context. When debating whether or not to accept a job offer, many \nindividuals are influenced not only by their perceived fit in the company, but also by \nhow well they believe they will fit in the surrounding community, and this is particularly \nthe case for job applicants who are LGBT (Barron & Hebl, 2010). Specifically, sexual \nminorities are attracted to organizations that are located within communities that have an \ninclusive climate for sexual orientation diversity (cf. Murray, 1996). The climate for \nsexual orientation diversity is thought to improve as the availability of significant social \nand instrumental support for sexual minorities’ increases (Hurtado, Carter, & Kardia, \n1998). Researchers have generally examined the community’s antidiscrimination \nemployment laws (Klawitter & Flatt, 1998) and the legality of same-sex marriage \n 47 \n(Melton & Cunningham, in press-a; Cunningham, 2010a) to determine the climate for \nsexual orientation diversity.    \n Some anecdotal evidence exists that suggests inclusive communities may \nencourage heterosexual residents to become allies. For instance, despite being located \nwithin a politically conservative state, Dallas is considered one of the friendliest cities \nfor LGBT individuals, which perhaps explains why it has the 9\nth\n largest concentration of \nsame-sex couples in the country (Moroney, 2007.). The city has had openly gay city-\ncouncil members since 1991, has the country’s largest LGBT church with over 3,500 \nmembers, and hosts one of the most successful Human Rights Campaign (an LGBT \nadvocacy group) fundraising events in the country. Thus, when many evangelical \nreligious organizations began to protest new antidiscrimination law in Dallas, many \nlocal, heterosexual business leaders—including Gerard Arpey, American Airlines \nCEO—mobilized to defend the importance of the proposed protections. These efforts \nwere critical to ensuring the antidiscrimination measure passed (―Dallas Officials Adopt \nMeasure,‖ 2002). Given this evidence, I propose: \nProposition 2: The presence of an inclusive climate for sexual orientation \ndiversity will be positively associated with attitudes toward sexual minorities.  \nMeso-Level Factors  \nIn addition to macro-level factors, meso-level factors can influence ally support \nfor LGBT equality. These factors operate at the group level (e.g., organizational or team \nlevel) of analysis and include the sexual orientation diversity in the organization and the \npresence of other allies.  \n 48 \nSexual orientation diversity. The sexual orientation diversity of the workplace \nmight impact ally support, such that as the proportion of sexual minorities increases, so \ntoo do people’s support for them. Consider for instance that people typically focus more \nattention on issues related to social justice and equality as the diversity in a social \ncontext increases (cf. Eagly & Chin, 2010; Fassinger, Shullman, & Stevenson, 2010). \nMartinez and Hebl (2010) make a similar argument when they encourage LGBT \nindividuals to disclosure their sexual orientation at work. The authors suggest being open \nabout one’s sexual orientation increases the visibility of LGBT issues in the workplace, \nreduces instances of sexual prejudice, and allows for friendships to form among LGBT \ncoworkers and their heterosexual counterparts. In essence, as more employees become \naware that sexual minorities exist in the workplace and start to build relationships with \nthese individuals, they are more likely to view LBGT individuals in a more positive light \nand see sexual orientation diversity as a salient issue.  \nThe number of employees who are LGBT can also signal to heterosexual \nemployees that sexual orientation diversity and inclusion initiatives are valued in the \norganization (Herdman & McMillan-Capehart, 2010). For example, Herdman and \nMcMillian-Capehart investigated the antecedents of diversity climates in organizations \nand discovered employee support for diversity programs was stronger when the \nmanagement team was composed of diverse individuals. In this example, coupling \ninclusive policies with actual diversity proved to be more successful in shaping \nemployee perceptions and garnering support for the programs, as these multiple efforts \nrepresented an actual commitment to the diversity on the part of the organization. Thus, \n 49 \nhaving high sexual orientation diversity may signal that the organization values \ninclusion, and expects employees to share these beliefs. Based on this reasoning I \npropose the following: \nProposition 3: High sexual orientation diversity will positively associate with \nattitudes toward sexual minorities.  \nPresence of other allies. In addition to the number of sexual minorities with \nwhom one works, the presence of other allies might influence ally support . Tenants \nfrom both social learning theory (Bandura, 1986) and social information processing \ntheory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) bolster this argument. First, a social learning \nperspective holds that nearly all skills or attitudes learned through personal experience \ncan also be acquired vicariously by observing the actions of others and the resulting \noutcomes of such behaviors. Social information processing theory posits similar \nassertions, and emphasizes that social interactions shape one’s perception of what \nattitudes and behaviors are appropriate in a work context. Furthermore, interactions with \nsupervisors and coworkers particularly influence these beliefs, including the acceptable \nresponse to LGBT-inclusion initiatives (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978).  \nSeveral theoretical and empirical arguments have advanced this idea. For \ninstance, research suggests leaders can inspire coworkers to champion diversity \ninitiatives (Gilbert & Ivancevich, 2000) and also discourage them from exhibiting \nprejudice (Umphress, Simmons, Boswell, & Triana, 2008). As one example, in \nUmphress et al.’s (2008) study, even when employees held prejudice attitudes, they do \nnot act in discriminatory ways when specifically instructed by their supervisors not to do \n 50 \nso. The influence of coworkers can act in similar ways, as Cunningham and Sartore \n(2010) observed that employees were more likely to champion diversity initiatives when \nthey perceived their coworkers showed high levels of support for diversity. In addition, \ncoworker support can be especially important if employees are dissatisfied with the \norganizational practices. For instance, Zhou and George (2001) found employees were \nmore likely to voice their frustration and suggest improvements to organizational polices \nwhen the amount of perceived coworker support was high. In this vein, employees who \noppose non-inclusive behaviors may be willing to speak out against discriminatory \nactions if they believe others in the organization share their concerns. The \naforementioned literature led us to propose the following: \nProposition 4: The presence of other allies in the workplace will positively \nassociate with attitudes toward sexual minorities.  \nMicro-Level Factors \nFinally, micro-level factors can also influence ally support. These factors \nmanifest at the individual-level and are specific to the person. I highlight three micro-\nlevel factors here: personality, personal values, and contact with LGBT individuals.  \nPersonality. One’s personality is likely to influence her or his support for LGBT \nequality, and the likelihood that they would act as an ally in the workplace. Thus, I drew \nfrom the five-factor model of personality to examine these dynamics. According to \nMcCrae and Costa (1996) personality is composed of five stable traits: extraversion, \nagreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and opened to experience. Of \nparticular interest to predictors of ally support are extraversion and openness to \n 51 \nexperiences. Extraverts are considered to be ―sociable, gregarious, talkative, assertive, \nadventurous, active, energetic, and ambitious‖ (Mount & Barrick, 1995, p. 165). Such \nqualities make these individuals natural leaders within group settings. They are \ncomfortable engaging in conversations with people from a variety of backgrounds and \nare less likely to shy away from discussing topics that may be considered controversial. \nTherefore, they may be more likely to interact with sexual minorities, thereby giving the \nopportunity to form more positive attitudes toward this group. Furthermore, because they \ntend to speak with passion and conviction, they are effective at influencing the opinions \nof others (Judge, Bono, Ilies, & Gerhardt, 2002). These characteristics are often \nnecessary for individuals who choose to act as allies in the workplace. That is, extraverts \nmay be more willing to take a stand against heterosexist policies and practices and may \nbe more effective at influence others in the organization to support such inclusive \ninitiatives. Cunningham and Sartore’s (2010) work on championing diversity initiatives \nprovides some support for this rational, as they observed extraverts were more likely \nthan their more introverted counterparts to champion diversity initiatives. Thus, \nconsistent with previous research, I propose the following: \nProposition 5:  Extraversion will positively associate with attitudes toward \nsexual minorities. \nResearch also suggests a link between openness to experience and ally support. \nIndividuals with this personality trait tend to be more creative, imaginative, cultured, and \nopen-minded. These individuals are more likely to appreciate diverse cultures and \nwelcome viewpoints that differ from their own (Flynn, 2005). Furthermore, in \n 52 \norganizational settings they are (a) more likely to emerge as leaders, and (b) when \nholding such a position, they are able to effectively articulate the value of organizational \ninitiatives (Judge et al., 2002). These skills allow them to successfully persuade others to \nembrace change initiatives. Considering employees with this personality characteristic \nare more likely value individual differences and then encourage others to share the same \ninclusive mindset, I propose the following: \nProposition 6: Openness to experience will positively associate with attitudes \ntoward sexual minorities.   \nPersonal values. According to fairness theory (Folger & Cropanzano, 2001), and \nspecifically the deontological model within this theory (Cropanzano, Goldman, & \nFolger, 2003), justice is considered a moral value held by all individuals, which guides \none’s attitudes and behaviors in social settings.  Although originally conceptualized as a \nstable variable, recent research suggests individual differences exist with regard to how, \nor to what degree, this ―justice virtue‖ is held. To account for these differences, scholars \nhave termed the construct justice orientation, defined as ―the extent to which individuals \ninternalize justice as a moral virtue and are attentive to issues of fairness around them‖ \n(Liao & Rupp, 2005, p. 244).  \nThere is some evidence to support the argument that allies may have higher \njustice orientations. For instance, employees oftentimes feel compelled to establish \ninclusive workplaces because of their personal sense of justice (Doherty & Chelladurai, \n1999). This belief in justice or fairness has also been a key determinant in whether \nemployees support or oppose affirmative action polices (Harrison et al., 2006). With \n 53 \nrespect to LGBT inclusion, personally held values and morals are a leading reason why \nindividuals become allies in their organizations (Russell, 2011). For example, in \nRussell’s qualitative analysis with 127 heterosexual allies, participants viewed \ncommitment to LGBT equality as a basic justice value, or felt morally obligated to take a \nstand for LGBT individuals.  When asked why she chose to be an ally, one woman even \nnoted, ―I think there’s a sense of justice to it; there’s a sense of being good people and \ndoing the right thing.‖ (Russell, 2011, p. 384). Based on these findings, I propose the \nfollowing: \nProposition 7: A high social justice orientation will positively associate with \nattitudes toward sexual minorities.   \nContact with LGBT individuals. According to Pettigrew (1998), contact with \nout-group members can alleviate intergroup tensions when in-group member begin to \nadjust how they see themselves in relation to out-group members. These experiences \nallow each group to learn more about the other, reduces negative stereotyping, and has \nthe potential to lead to friendships among in-group and out-group members.  \n In regards to sexual minorities, research suggests that as these affective ties form, \nthe potential for ally support increases. For instance, in their longitudinal study of \nAmerican adults, Herek and Capitanio (1996) observed sexual prejudice was \nsignificantly lower for individuals who had established relationships with LGBT \nindividuals. In addition, findings from Pettigrew and Tropp’s (2006) meta-analysis \nsuggest contact with sexual minorities is negatively associated with sexual prejudice \namong heterosexuals. Furthermore, employees with friends and family members who are \n 54 \nLGBT are oftentimes more aware of the discrimination and prejudice sexual minorities \nface in society (Russell, 2011). They witness how negative attitudes diminish the \nexperiences and opportunities of those they love. As such, they begin to realize the need \nfor LGBT equality. Given these findings, I propose the following: \nProposition 8: Greater contact with LGBT individuals will positively associate \nwith attitudes toward sexual minorities.   \nBehavioral Ally Support \nAs illustrated in Figure 1, more positive attitudes toward sexual minorities and \nLGBT inclusion should lead to behavioral forms of support. However, people do not \nalways display the same level of behavioral support. Thus, it is necessary to distinguish \nbetween the various ways allies show their commitment to LGBT inclusion at work. To \ndo so, I primarily draw from Herscovitch and Meyer’s (2002) model for commitment to \norganizational change. Within this model, one’s commitment to a behavior (i.e., LGBT \ninclusion and equality), can manifest in one of two behavioral forms: focal or \ndiscretionary. Focal behaviors include actions that are required of the employee. For \ninstance, employees may include the term ―partner‖ or ―significant other‖ on social \nevent or banquet invitations if an organization mandates the use of inclusive language. \nAdhering to this policy is an example of a compliance behavior, whereas failing to do so \nwould be resistance behavior (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002).  \nDiscretionary behaviors differ from focal behaviors in that they involve the \nemployee going above and beyond what is expected or required by the organization. \nThere are two degrees of discretionary behaviors. First, cooperation behaviors ensue \n 55 \nwhen employees value the initiative and are willing to make modest sacrifices to ensure \nits success. Second, championing behaviors occur when employees fully embrace the \nchange beyond what is required by the organization. For instance, rather than simply \npromoting inclusion in the workplace, these champions may join outside ally groups that \nwork to ensure broader from of LGBT equality, such as legalizing same-sex marriage. \nAt times, these efforts can involve considerable personal sacrifice, especially if the issue \nthey champion is controversial or unpopular (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002).  \nBy many respects, championing is the ideal form of discretionary behavior \nbecause it is the most effective in terms of garnering individual support for \norganizational initiatives (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002). Consider the actions of former \nAll-American wrestler, Hudson Taylor. During his senior year, Taylor began to \nchampion LGBT inclusion on his wrestling team. When teammates would use LGBT \nslurs to disparage others, he would openly rebuke them for such actions. Furthermore, he \nwore the Human Rights Campaign logo on his wrestling headgear as a way to create \nawareness about LGBT issues in sport. Though many teammates discouraged his \nactions, and at times opponents harassed him based on the assumption he was gay, he \nremained resolute in his convictions to LGBT equality (Buzinski, 2010).  In addition to \nhis efforts in the wrestling domain, he also donated his time and money to various LGBT \nrights organizations.  He has now started his own nonprofit organization, Athlete Ally, \nwhich encourages heterosexual sport participants, coaches, and employees to take a \nstand against heterosexism and homophobia (www.athleteally.com). Today, nearly 5,000 \npeople have signed the Athlete Ally pledge to respect all people, regardless of sexual \n 56 \norientation, and to make sport more inclusive for LGBT individuals. As is evident by \nthese examples, Taylor is the quintessential champion for LGBT inclusion in sport. His \nactions point to how instrumental the acts of individuals can be to improving the sport \nexperiences of persons who are LGBT, even when organizations lack formal policies \nthat protect LGBT rights. Based on the aforementioned literature on employee \nbehaviors, I propose the following: \nProposition 9: Favorable attitudes toward sexual minorities will positively \nassociate with championing behaviors.  \nPotential Moderators to the Aforementioned Relationships \n It is also important to discuss factors that may influence the relationship between \nattitudes and championing behaviors, as specification of moderators and boundary \nconditions are key elements of theory building (Bacharach, 1989; Colquitt & Zapata-\nPhelan, 2007). Furthermore, from and applied perspective, is necessary to understand \nwhat factors are associated with championing LGBT initiatives in the workplace and \nhow these factors might vary based on context, as doing so allows for sport managers to \nform more effective ways of garnering support for LGBT inclusion.  \nPower \nThere are three potential moderators to the current model, the first of which is \npower. Several prominent scholars in the field of sport management have argued \ndiversity research, particularly studies focusing on gender equity in sport organizations, \nmust not rely solely on liberal feminist approaches to examining the experiences of \nmarginalized groups in sport (Frisby, 2005; Shaw & Frisby, 2006). Doing so renders the \n 57 \nresearcher incapable of understanding the impact of deeply held attitudes within \norganizational culture toward diversity. Instead, researchers must acknowledge how \npower, both informal and formal in nature, influences social processes in sport and may \nserve to impede or facilitate progress toward greater inclusion and equality (Doherty, \nFink, Inglis, & Pastore, 2010). One’s power or status in a sport organization has the \npotential to significantly impact their behavioral commitment to LGBT inclusion and \nequality. For instance, the prototypical sport employee is considered to be White, \nheterosexual, Protestant, able-bodied male (see Fink & Pastore, 1999). Individual who \npossess these characteristics typically have more power, prestige, and resources in sport \nthan those who deviate from this norm in one or more ways (Sartore & Cunningham, \n2010).  \nThis is significant to the current theoretical model because women or racial \nminorities may be less apt to champion LGBT inclusion initiatives. There are several \nreasons for this. First, consider how sexual prejudice limits the opportunities and \nexperiences of women in sport. According to Sartore and Cunningahm (2009b), the \nlesbian stigma ―exists within sport’s heterosexist and heteronormative context as a \nmeans to subvert women’s status, power, influence, and experiences‖ (p. 289). \nConsequently, women, regardless of sexual orientation, frequently adopt identity \nmanagement techniques to ensure they always present an ultra-feminine, heterosexual \nimage. Thus, becoming an ally or associating oneself with LGBT issues may leave \nwomen susceptible to stigma by association (Goffman, 1963), in which other assume \nthey must also be lesbian (Herek, 2009). This may explain why so few women in sport \n 58 \nhave spoken out against heterosexism and homophobia, whereas a number of men have \nrecently taken a public stand against LGBT discrimination (Griffin, 2011). \nRacial minorities might also be hesitant to engage in ally behaviors because of \ntheir marginalized status in sport. As Cunningham (2011b) notes, discussing \ncontroversial issues or advocating for the rights of the oppressed can be quite unpopular \nand potentially harmful to a person’s career, particularly if the person is a racial \nminority. Indeed, research suggests academics (Henderson, 2009), sports journalists \n(Jackson, 2006), professional athletes (Powell, 2008), and collegiate athletes \n(Agyemang, Singer, & DeLoreme, 2010) all recognize the financial costs (e.g., fewer \nendorsement deals, limited job opportunities) of becoming an activist. As such, these \nindividuals may be less likely to championing LGBT initiatives so to avoid the risks \nassociated with doing so. While I focus one gender and race above, differences \nassociated with gender, race, national origin, ethnicity, social class, religion, age, \nphysical ability, relationship status, or appearance can all influence one’s power and \nstatus in a sport organization, and thereby impact one’s behavioral support for LGBT \ninclusion and equality. Therefore, I propose the following:  \nProposition 10: Status will moderate the relationship between attitudes toward \nsexual minorities and championing behaviors for LGBT inclusion, such that \nthose in high power positions within an organization will be more likely than \nthose in low power positions to engage in championing behaviors in the \nworkplace.  \n \n 59 \nExpectancy Beliefs  \nThe second moderator is one’s expectancy beliefs, and refers to the ally’s \nperception that her or his efforts will effectively produce change in the organization. \nDrawing from expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964), expectancy is the belief that one’s \nactions will result in desired outcomes. Generally, individuals base this decision on past \nexperiences, degree of self-confidence, and perceived difficulty of attaining the goal. If \nallies (a) feel confident in their ability to promote inclusiveness, (b) have witnessed \nothers advocate for LGBT equality not meet substantial resistance, and (c) believe their \nefforts will create the desired change, they are more likely to champion LGBT inclusion. \nHowever, if this is not the case, an ally may be hesitant to take a public stand due to the \nperception that, regardless of one’s actions, nothing will ever change in the organization. \nThis pessimistic attitude may lead allies to engage in more compliance behaviors instead \nof compliance or champion behaviors. Thus, I propose the following: \nProposition 12: Expectancy beliefs will moderate the relationship between \nattitudes toward sexual minorities and championing behaviors for LGBT \ninclusion, such that individuals who believe their actions will successfully create \nequality in the workplace will be more likely to engage in championing \nbehaviors. \nCommitment to Diversity \nFinally, the organizational culture related to diversity is the final moderator in the \nmodel. According to Fink and Pastore (1999), organizations with a commitment to \ndiversity focus on people and respect the differences their employees bring to the \n 60 \norganization. The organization encourages managers to have a greater tolerance for risk \nand ambiguity, which in turn gives employees the freedom and flexibility to challenge \ntraditional practices develop new and innovative ways of conducting business.  This \nenvironment contains open lines of communication, multilevel decision-making systems, \nand open group membership. In contrast, an organization that does not have a \ncommitment to diversity, views differences as deficits or a source of conflict that will \ninevitable limit productivity and performance. Consequently, these organizations have \nclosed lines of communication, one-sided decision-making systems, and closed group \nmembership.  \nEmployees who work within an organizational that demonstrates a commitment \nto diversity may perceive less personal risk to being an ally who champions inclusion, as \ntheir environment encourages and embraces different viewpoints. On the other hand, if a \nsport organization does not display this commitment, it is less likely that employees will \nhave the confidence to challenge the status quo.  Thus, I propose the following:  \nProposition 13: An organization’s commitment to diversity will moderate the \nrelationship between attitudes toward sexual minorities and championing \nbehaviors, such that allies will be more likely to champion LGBT inclusion if the \norganization displays a commitment to diversity than allies who work in an \norganization that does not show this commitment. \nDiscussion \n Individuals who are LGBT represent a significant number of employees in \ntoday’s workplace, as recent estimates suggest 4 to 17 percent of US residents identify as \n 61 \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Managers who recognize this population and \nactively promote sexual orientation diversity in their organization can reap many \nbenefits. For instance, Cunningham and Melton (2011) argue greater sexual orientation \ndiversity is positively associated with enhanced decision-making capabilities, improved \nmarketplace understanding of LGBT consumers and fans, and increase goodwill among \nexternal stakeholders who value socially responsible practices. In order to realize these \npositive outcomes, organizations must create an inclusive work atmosphere that allows \nsexual minorities to reach their full potential and effectively contribute to the goals of \nthe organization. This includes establishing a work environment where LGBT \nindividuals can freely disclose their sexual orientation without the fear of enduring \nnegative consequences (such as job termination, negative stereotyping, harassment, \nsocial isolation) for doing so. Past research has primarily examined how organizational \npolices can foster inclusion in the workplace, and devoted less attention to the role \nindividuals play in regards to endorsing and actively promoting LGBT equality (for \nexceptions see Brooks & Edwards, 2009; Cunningham & Sartore, 2010). Thus, the \npurpose in articulating this theoretical framework was to outline the specific macro-, \nmeso-, and micro-level antecedents of ally support, identify the behavioral outcomes of \nsuch support, and discuss potential moderators associated with these relationships. The \nfollowing section addresses implications, future research directions, and conclusions of \nthis conceptual framework.  \n \n \n 62 \nImplications  \nThere are several potential implications of the proposed model. First, whereas \nprevious literature examines micro-level factors for why people become allies for LGBT \nequality and inclusion, limited attention has explored higher-level factors that may shape \nindividual attitudes or experiences. Our theoretical model addresses this potential \nshortcoming, and follows the suggestion of other sport scholars who encourage \nresearchers to develop multilevel conceptual frameworks to examine social phenomena \nin sport. Doing so allowed me to account for the complex nature of sport organizations \nwhile also creating a more holistic understanding of causes, and subsequent effects, of \nally support (cf. Bruening & Dixon, 2007; Chelladurai, 2009). \nSecond, this model proposes that support or endorsement of LGBT equality does \nnot always translate to ally behaviors, and if it does, behaviors may vary in degree of \ncommitment (cf. Avery, 2011). Thus, managers should not assume, that based on certain \ncharacteristics, a person will take an active stand against acts of sexual prejudice. Rather, \nan employee’s power or status within the organization, expectations regarding whether \nindividual actions will produce change, or the organization’s commitment to diversity \nmay serve to inspire or dissuade one from publically supporting LGBT inclusion.   \nFinally, recent research has demonstrated sexual orientation diversity can \nmeaningfully enhance organizational outcomes. Cunningham (2011c) observed such \ndynamics when examining the influence this diversity form has on an athletic \ndepartment’s success.  His investigation demonstrated that NCAA athletic departments \nsignificantly outperformed their peers in term of total NACDA points if the organization \n 63 \nhad both high sexual orientation diversity and a culture for diversity. In a later study, \nexploring the effects of sexual orientation diversity in Division III athletic departments, \nCunningham (2011a) observed that high sexual orientation diversity, when coupled with \na strong organizational commitment to diversity, led to more creative work \nenvironments. It is important to emphasize, the benefits associated with sexual \norientation diversity were only realized when the organization had policies and practices \nthat promoted inclusion in the workplace.  \nThus, it is imperative that managers attempt to attract and select individuals who \nwill endorse and champion inclusion initiatives. One effective means of accomplishing \nthis goal is to promote an LGBT-friendly image during the recruiting process. Research \nexamining diversity-friendly organizations suggests having such an image attracts \napplicants who endorse, rather than oppose diversity initiatives (Avery & McKay, 2006). \nFurthermore, with respect to LGBT issues, Melton and Cunningham (in press-a) \ndiscovered both heterosexual and LGBT job applicants are more attracted to sport \norganizations with LGBT inclusive polices. Thus, the benefits of having an inclusive \nworkplace are many. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 64 \nCHAPTER IV \nCHAMPIONING SEXUAL ORIENTATION DIVERSITY: PREDICTORS OF ALLY \nSUPPORT AMONG SPORT EMPLOYEES \n \nBy many accounts, societal attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, or \ntransgender (LGBT) individuals have significantly improved over the past few decades \n(Herek, 2009), and heterosexist practices are frequently challenged (Anderson, 2011).  \nFor instance, survey results in 2011 marked the first time in United States’ history that a \nmajority of Americans’ polled consider homosexuality to be an acceptable lifestyle \n(Herek, 2011), and over 50 percent of eligible voters expressed they would support \nsame-sex marriage. As of 2012, six states (including Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, \nNew Hampshire, New York, and Vermont), the District of Columbia, and two Native \nAmerican tribes (i.e., Oregon’s Coquille and Washington states’ Suquamish Indian \ntribes) allow same-sex marriage. While recent marriage equality laws certainly signal \naccepting attitudes, perhaps a greater testament of progressive views is the increase in \nLGBT-inclusive policies and practices offered by many Fortune 500 companies. Indeed, \nnow 86 percent of these firms include ―sexual orientation‖ in their non-discrimination \nemployment statement, and a majority provide domestic partner insurance benefits \n(www.HRC.org).  \nThe shift in attitudes that has been observed at the national level has also \ninfluenced attitudes toward LGBT sport employees and participants (Cunningham, \n2012). Indeed, a number of heterosexual athletes and coaches have recently formed \n 65 \norganizations aimed at confronting sexual prejudice and homophobia in sport, such as \nAthlete Ally (www.athleteally.org) and Equality Coaching Alliance \n(equalitycoachingalliance.org). In addition, Changing the Game: The GLSEN (Gay, \nLesbian and Straight Education Network) Sports Project is an initiative designed to \nequip schools (K-12) with the skills and knowledge necessary to create safe and \naccepting sport and physical education environments for all coaches, teachers, and \nstudents irrespective of sexual orientation (sports.glsen.org).  \nThe aforementioned organizations recognize how athletics and physical \neducation programs provide a unique setting to teach values of respect, acceptance, and \nequality. Specifically, sport participation allows persons from diverse backgrounds to \nexperience competitive and collaborative activities that promote teamwork, \nsportsmanship, fair play, and friendships with dissimilar others. These organizations \nstress, in order to realize these benefits, individuals (e.g., coaches, players, spectators) \nmust create and maintain inclusive sport climates. Interestingly though, while \npractitioners routinely emphasize the important role coaches, players, administrators, \nand sport employees play in establishing such environments, sport scholars have devoted \nrelatively little attention to this issue. Rather, examinations of LGBT issues focus \nprimarily on sources, expressions, and consequences of sexual prejudice in sport. And, \nwhile these investigations are warranted, researchers have failed to explore factors \nrelated to an individual’s support for LGBT inclusion and equality. Such an omission is \nunfortunate, as identifying key antecedent variables can enhance practitioner efforts to \nfoster inclusion and acceptance for sexual minorities in sport.    \n 66 \nThus, the aim of this study was to remedy this situation by examining the \nantecedents of individual support for sexual orientation diversity in sport organizations. \nSpecifically, I drew from the multilevel model explaining ally support (outlined in Study \n2) to investigate the influence of certain micro- (i.e., individual), meso- (i.e., group or \norganizational), and macro-level (i.e., societal) factors on attitudes toward sexual \nminorities among sport employees. In doing so, I also explore the relationship between \nattitudes toward sexual minorities and behavioral support for sexual orientation \ndiversity. In the following sections, I outline the theoretical framework and present \nspecific hypotheses.  \nMultilevel Model for Examining Ally Support \nThe multilevel model for ally support identifies factors at the micro-level \n(individual), meso-level (organizational), and macro-level (societal) that influence \nattitudes toward sexual minorities. In addition, it explains that these attitudes then relate \nto one’s behavioral support for LGBT inclusion in the workplace (see Figure 3). Below, \nI discuss these processes.  \nMicro-Level Factors  \nAs demonstrated in Studies 1 and 2, micro-level factors can influence ally \nsupport. These factors manifest at the individual-level and are specific to the person. I \nhighlight three micro-level factors here: demographic variables, personality, and \npersonal values. \nDemographic variables. Research focusing on support for LGBT equality \ndemonstrates several trends related to differences based on demographic variables. First, \n 67 \nthere is some evidence to suggest racial differences in attitudes toward sexual minorities; \nhowever, most of these research focuses on expressions of sexual prejudice.  \nSpecifically, authors have observed differences related to race when examining sexual \nprejudice among college students (Ahrnold & Meston, 2010; Brown & Henriquez, 2008; \nWhitley et al., 2011), undergraduate women (Vincent, Peterson, & Parrott, 2009), and \nurban youth (Gastic, 2012). In the one analysis I could identify that examined the \ninfluence of race on LGBT support (rather than sexual prejudice), Gastic’s results \nsuggest White youth hold more supportive attitudes toward sexual minorities than Latino \nand African American youth. Racial differences have also been observed in the sport \nliterature. When examining attitudes among White and African American men, Southall, \nAnderson, Nagel, Polite, and Southall’s (2011) work shows African Americans are more \nlikely to identify as homophobic, reject the idea of having a LGBT coach, and would be \nwould be unwilling to have a gay teammate. Findings from Cunningham and Melton (in \npress-b) also show racial differences among parents of athletes. Specially, they found \nAsian American parents expressed more sexual prejudice toward LGBT coaches than \ndid Latinos or Whites. Given this collective evidence, I hypothesized: \nHypothesis 1a: Race will be negatively associated with attitudes toward sexual \nminorities, such that racial minorities will express less favorable attitudes toward \nsexual minorities.  \nThere is also evidence to suggest gender differences may explain one’s attitudes \ntoward sexual minorities. For instance, empirical investigations on social movements \nsuggest women are more likely than men to act as advocates for a number of social \n 68 \ncauses (Jasper & Poulsen, 1995). Furthermore, women who engage in activist activities \ngenerally form close alliances with out-group members, which influences their attitudes \ntoward these individuals (cf. Fingerhut, 2011).  \nGender is also associated with attitudes toward LGBT individuals. For instance, \nHerek’s (2009) work on sexual prejudice consistently shows heterosexual men report \nmore negative views of sexual minorities when compared to heterosexual women. Kite \nand Whitley’s (1996) meta-analysis also demonstrated a similar gender difference, such \nthat women held less negative views toward lesbian and gay individuals than did men. In \naddition to gender being related to lower levels of sexual prejudice, Fingerhut (2011) \nfound woman were more likely to hold more positive attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, \nand bisexuals. Therefore, I hypothesized: \nHypothesis 1b: Gender will be associated with attitudes toward sexual \nminorities, such that women will express more positive attitudes toward sexual \nminorities.  \n Personality. In addition to demographic variables, personality can also impact \nattitudes related to sexual orientation. One’s personality is the unique set of ―thoughts, \nfeelings, and behaviors that distinguishes one person from another and that persists over \ntime‖ (Phares, 1994, p. 4). A number of studies have shown personality traits can \ninfluence one’s opinions (cf. Heaven, Mak, Barry, & Ciarrochi, 2002), and the same \nassociation holds for attitudes toward sexual minorities. In fact, there is some evidence \nto suggest openness to experiences (OTE), extraversion, and self-confidence relate to \nmore favorable opinions concerning LGBT issues.  \n 69 \nAccording to Costa and Widiger (1994) people who exhibit higher OTE ―are \ncurious, imaginative, and willing to entertain novel ideas and unconventional values‖ \n(p.3). Furthermore, these individuals generally appreciate diverse viewpoints and seek \nout relationships with people from a variety of cultures and backgrounds. Thus, they \nmay be more likely to form positive attitudes toward sexual minorities because they \nallow themselves to learn about diverse people and perspectives that deviate from \nsocietal norms. Shackelford and Besser’s (2007) findings provide support for this \nlinkage. Specifically, participants in their study who scored high on OTE were more \nlikely to support marriage equality, civil unions, and adoption rights for LGBT persons. \nIn addition, in Study 1, those interviewed held the perception that more ―open-minded‖ \ncoworkers tended to express more favorable attitudes toward sexual minorities and were \nmore likely to support LGBT inclusion in the workplace. Based on these findings, I \nhypothesized the following:  \nHypothesis 2a: Openness to experiences will be positively associated with \nattitudes toward sexual minorities.   \nExtraversion is another personality trait that may be linked to attitudes toward \nLGBT individuals. People with this trait tend to be ―sociable, gregarious, assertive, \ntalkative, and active‖ (Barrick & Mount, 1991, p.3). Researchers have shown that these \nqualities allow extraverts to develop valued social skills, work well in teams, and be \nmore satisfied with coworkers (Morgeson, Reider, & Campion, 2005). Furthermore, \nextraverts interact with dissimilar others more frequently, increasing the possibility that \nmeaningful relationships will form (Perry, Dubin, & Witt, 2010). These interactions can \n 70 \nchallenge or reduce previously held stereotypes as extraverts gain a better understanding \nof out-group members (Flynn, Chatman, & Spataro, 2001). Thus, these experiences may \nincrease the likelihood that extraverts will form more positive attitudes toward out-group \nmembers, including those who are LGBT. Thus, I hypothesized the following:  \nHypothesis 2b: Extraversion will be positively associated with attitudes toward \nsexual minorities.  \nIn addition to OTE and extraversion, a person’s level of confidence can also hold \nan association with attitudes toward sexual minorities, although limited research has \nexamined this relationship. Confidence represents a state of being certain that one’s \nthoughts are correct, or that certain behaviors or a course of action is most appropriate \n(Hogarth, 2006). Some research demonstrates confidence influences one’s attitudes, \nparticularly if these attitudes are considered to be controversial in society. For instance, \nZorn, Roper, Broadfoot, and Weaver (2006) observed that confident individuals were \nmore likely to express support for human biotechnology (i.e., genetic research that can \ninclude cloning and embryology, pharmaceuticals composed of genetically modified \norganisms, stem-cell research, or genetically modified food), than those who exhibited \nless confidence.  Specifically, those with high confidence felt more at ease with their \nopinions, and embraced their positive attitudes toward the controversial research. In \naddition, in Study 1, participant perceptions indicated confident individuals were more \nlikely to express positive views regarding sexual minorities and LGBT inclusion. To \nempirically test the findings in Study 1, I hypothesized: \n 71 \nHypothesis 2c: Confidence will be positively associated with attitudes toward \nsexual minorities. \nPersonal values. An individual’s concern for social justice may also influence \nattitudes toward persons who are LGBT. Social justice pertains to how recourses in \nsociety are distributed to individuals (Miller, 1999).  Those who have a high concern for \nsocial justice believe practices in society should ensure resources are distributed equally \nto all citizens. And, if some groups are disproportionally advantaged in society, \nindividuals should attempt to rectify the situation (Miller, 1999).  \nBeliefs related to justice or fairness has been shown to shape people’s attitudes \ntoward various marginalized groups. For example, concern for social justice is a key \npredictor in support for affirmative action policies (Harrison et al., 2006), state funding \nfor communities with low socioeconomic status (Kluegel & Miyano, 1995), and \nprograms for persons with HIV (Werth et al., 2008). With respect to LGBT inclusion, \nthere is evidence to support the notion that one’s concern for social justice influences her \nor his attitudes toward sexual minorities. For instance, in a study examining attitudes \ntoward homosexuality, 42% of undergraduate students indicated their views toward \nsexual minorities stem from their belief in social justice (Hans, Kersey, & Kimberly, \n2012). Furthermore, students who felt all people should be treated equally and that \ndiscrimination should not be accepted in modern societies were more likely to hold \npositive attitudes toward same-sex relationships. Considering this evidence, I \nhypothesized the following:  \n 72 \nHypothesis 3: Social Justice beliefs will be positively associated with attitudes \ntoward sexual minorities. \nMeso-Level Factors \n As discussed in Study 2, certain meso- or organizational-level factors influence \nemployee support for sexual orientation diversity, including the number of sexual \nminorities working in the organization (i.e., SOD or sexual orientation diversity), and the \npresence of allies in the workplace. \n Sexual orientation diversity. The number of LGBT employees (i.e., sexual \norientation diversity) working within a sport organization can also influence employee \nattitudes toward sexual minorities. According to Allport’s (1954) contact hypothesis, \ncontact with out-group members should reduce prejudice because it provides an \nopportunity for people to learn about dissimilar others, challenges myths and negative \nstereotypes, decreases anxiety associated with being around out-group members, and \nallows people to reevaluate their opinions of these individuals. A number of researchers \nhave demonstrated that contact with sexual minorities can decrease sexual prejudice (de \nBruin & Arndt, 2010; Herek, 1988; Herek & Capitanio, 1996), and create positive \nattitudes toward persons who are LGBT (Hans et. al, 2012; Martinez & Hebl, 2010). \nMartinez and Hebl (2010) contend when LGBT individuals are open about their sexual \norientation at work, heterosexual coworkers gain a greater awareness of LGBT issues in \nthe workplace, reduce enactment of sexual prejudice, and can form more positive \nopinions of sexual minorities.  \n 73 \nSexual orientation diversity can also signal that the organization values, and thus \nwants employees to value, diversity and inclusion initiatives (Herdman & McMillan-\nCapehart, 2010). For example, Herdman and McMillian-Capehart (2010) found \nemployee support for diversity was associated with the amount of the diversity in the \nworkgroup. In this example, employees developed a more favorable view of diversity \nprograms because the organization demonstrated, in both policy and action (e.g., hiring \ndiverse candidates), diversity was important. Thus, having high sexual orientation \ndiversity may signal that the organization values sexual minorities and expects \nemployees to share these views. As such, I hypothesized the following:  \nHypothesis 4: The sexual orientation diversity of the organization will be \npositively associated with attitudes toward sexual minorities.  \nPresence of allies. In addition to the sexual orientation diversity within sport \norganization, the presence of allies might influence attitudes toward sexual minorities. \nThe multilevel model presented in Study 2 drew from both social learning theory \n(Bandura, 1986) and social information processing theory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) to \nsupport this argument. First, a social learning perspective argues that many skills and \nattitudes can be learned vicariously by observing the actions of others. Social \ninformation processing theory provides similar arguments, and emphasizes that social \ninteractions will influence one’s notion of what attitudes are acceptable in a work \ncontext. Furthermore, exchanges with supervisors and coworkers particularly influence \nthese views, including the appropriate and expected response to LGBT-inclusion \ninitiatives (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978).  \n 74 \nA number of theoretical and empirical arguments have supported this assertion. \nFor instance, research suggests leaders can inspire coworkers to champion diversity \ninitiatives (Gilbert & Ivancevich, 2000; Hans et al., 2012) and also discourage them \nfrom expressing prejudice (Umphress, Simmons, Boswell, & Triana, 2008). Tooms and \nAlston’s (2006) investigations of leaders on university campuses draw similar \nconclusions. These authors suggest, that with proper diversity training, student leaders \ncan improve attitudes toward sexual minorities among undergraduate students. In \naddition to the importance of leaders, Gastic’s (2012) findings provide evidence for how \npeers influence attitudes. Although his study was not in a work context, participants had \nmore positively attitudes toward homosexuality when their friends and acquaintances \nheld similar views. Based on these findings, I hypothesized the following: \nHypothesis 5a: Supervisor support for sexual orientation diversity will be \npositively associated with attitudes toward LGBT inclusion.  \nHypothesis 5b: Coworker support for sexual orientation diversity will be \npositively associated with attitudes toward LGBT inclusion.  \nMacro-Level Factors \nMacro-level antecedents of ally support are elements that are external to a \nspecific sport organization or team, but may still exert considerable influence on \nindividual attitudes within these contexts. Below, I discuss two macro-level factors that \nmay influence ally support: mass media and marriage equality.  \nMass media. Research suggests the media can influence attitudes toward sexual \nminorities. In fact, Kane (1988) contends the media is ―one of the most powerful \n 75 \ninstitutional forces for shaping values and attitudes in modern culture‖ (p. 89). The \nimages and themes promoted in the media can—explicitly and implicitly—influence \none’s feelings toward various subjects, change how one thinks, and even shape people’s \nviews concerning sexuality (Coakley, 2009; Melton, 2010). Furthermore, Kingdon \n(1995) suggests that the media can be instrumental in moving issues into public dialogue \nand can have a profound influence on people’s opinions related to public policy. While \nKingdon’s finding were based on qualitative interviews, other research has provided \nquantitate evidence to support his arguments (Birkland, 1997).  \nThe primary way the media influences opinion is by framing an issue. \nSpecifically, framing is the process by which a communication source, such as cable \nnews channels or Internet blogs, define and construct a national or local issue (Nelson, \nClawson and Oxley, 1997). It is important to note, the media does not tell an audience \nwhat to think; it simply suggests issues an audience should think about (McCombs & \nShaw, 1972), which according to Entman (1989), can significantly affect attitudes. With \nregards to attitudes toward sexual minorities, there is some evidence to suggest liberal \nnews outlets frame LGBT issues in a more favorable light when compared to \nconservative news media (Lewis & Rogers, 2000; Nelson & Oxley, 1999). Furthermore, \nresearch suggests those who watch more liberal news outlets, tend to have more \nfavorable opinions of LGBT equality (Lee & Hicks, 2012). Based on this literature, I \nhypothesized: \nHypotheses 6: People who consume more liberal types of media will have more \npositive attitudes toward sexual minorities.       \n 76 \nMarriage equality. Another macro-level factor that may positively influence \nattitudes toward sexual minorities is the state law regarding same-sex marriage. While \nmost research has examined how changing attitudes influence laws, there is some \nevidence that the law can have a significant impact on attitudes. For instance, after Roe \nv. Wade was passed, reproductive rights for women became a national topic of \nconversation, and for some citizens, it was the first time they had heard arguments in \nsupport of legalized abortion. These public debates are perhaps why many people now \nconcede abortion is sometimes in the best interest of the woman (Shaw, 2003), even if \nthey view it as morally wrong.  In the same way, when a state is debating whether to \nlegalize same-sex marriage, citizens are exposed to a number of arguments related to the \nlaw. Thus, these discussions may have a positive impact on one’s attitudes toward sexual \nminorities, particularly if the person has more liberal or moderate political leanings. \nBased on this reasoning, I hypothesize the following:  \nHypothesis 7: People in states with same-sex marriage will have more positive \nattitudes toward sexual minorities than those who do not.  \nChampioning Behaviors \nThus far, I have hypothesized associations between factors at the micro-, meso-, \nand macro-level and attitudes toward sexual minorities. In all of these hypotheses, I \nsuspect that these factors will be positively related to attitudes toward sexual minorities, \nwhich will then by positively associated with behavioral support for LGBT equality. In \nother words, these factors will have a direct effect on attitudes and an indirect effect on \nbehaviors regarding support for sexual minorities in the workplace (See Figure 3).  \n 77 \nOf course, people can engage in different types of behaviors. According to \nHerscovitch and Meyer’s (2002), employees’ behavior support of an organizational \ninitiative (i.e., LGBT inclusion and equality), can manifest in the form of either focal or \ndiscretionary behaviors. Focal behaviors relate to actions the organization requires the \nemployee to do—failure to exhibit these behaviors could result in negative consequences \n(e.g., poor appraisals, job termination). The authors use the term compliance to refer to \ninstances when employees adhere to organizational policies, and use resistance to \ndescribe when employees fail to perform such actions (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002).  \nIt is also possible, though, for employees to display discretionary behaviors, \nwhich involve behaving in ways that exceed the organization’s requirements and \nexpectations (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002). This is shown when employees engage in \ncooperation or championing behaviors.  Cooperation requires employees to make \nmodest sacrifices to ensure an organizational policy is successful, while championing \nrelates more to when employees fully embrace the merits of an initiative.  \nScholars contend championing behaviors are the most effective at initiating \nchange within an organization (Cunningham & Sartore, 2010a; Herscovitch & Meyer, \n2002). Champions are successful because they inspire others, by their words and actions, \nto support a cause. These individuals are willing to turn their attitudes into action \nbecause they believe the initiative symbolizes their core values and represents part of \ntheir self-concept. As such, in an effort to remain true to their personal beliefs, they will \nsometimes endure personal sacrifice to ensure others realize the importance of the \nchange. For example, consider the efforts of the Freedom Riders who attempted to end \n 78 \nsegregation in the South. Frustrated with the federal government for neglecting civil \nrights issues, in 1961, the Freedom Riders (more than 400 White and Black Americans) \nchose to deliberately violate Jim Crow laws by traveling together on buses and trains \nthroughout the Deep South (Arsenault, 2006). During their journey, many riders were \nthreatened, brutally beaten, imprisoned, had buses set on fire, and some were even killed \nfor sitting next to a person of a different race. After five months of risking their lives, the \ngovernment finally realized the negative consequences of segregation and ordered that \nall bus and rail stations be integrated. These brave individuals were able to change \nhistory because they not only believed Blacks and Whites should have equal rights, but \nthey were also willing to publically display their beliefs (Arsenault, 2006). The Freedom \nRiders were true champions of racial equality. Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that \nthose who strongly believe in LGBT equality and have positive attitudes toward sexual \nminorities will be more likely to champion LGBT inclusion in the workplace. Therefore, \nI hypothesized: \nHypothesis 8: Positive attitudes toward sexual minorities will be positively \nassociated with championing behaviors.  \nOf course, certain situational factors may influence this relationship. According to Hogg \n(2006), context can drastically influence one’s behaviors to the extent that individuals \nwill act in accordance with prevailing social norms in a particular setting—even if the \nbehaviors contradict their personal beliefs or attitudes. As such, one’s championing \nbehaviors related to LGBT inclusion initiatives might vary depending on the nature of \nthe workplace. For instance, sport organizations that show an overt commitment to \n 79 \ndiversity create work environments where employees feel safe to express divergent \nviews (Fink & Pastore, 1999), which can include their pro-LGBT attitudes. \nOrganizations that display this commitment encourage open lines of communication \nwith the intent of capturing the benefits diversity can bring. Furthermore, formal and \ninformal diversity strategies, practices and policies are put in place so that organizations \ncan capitalize on the individual differences within their diverse staff (Fink & Pastore). \nFindings from Study 1 suggest that when an organization does not value diversity or \ndisplay a commitment to diversity and inclusion, employees may be less likely to take a \nstand for LGBT equality. Melton and Cunningham (in press) also observed a similar \npattern in their qualitative analysis, in that employees were more likely to show support \nfor their LGBT coworkers when they worked in departments that valued diversity; \nhowever, few coworkers took a stand when the department did not express this value.  \nThus, a sport organization’s commitment to diversity might inspire employees to exhibit \nbehavioral support for sexual orientation diversity or discourage them from doing so. \nThus, I hypothesized the following: \nHypothesis 9: The relationship between attitudes toward sexual minorities and \nchampioning behavior will be moderated by the organization’s commitment to \ndiversity, such that employees will engage in more championing behaviors when \nthe organization displays a commitment to diversity than employees who work in \norganizations that do not demonstrate a commitment to diversity.  \n \n \n 80 \nMethod \nParticipants \n  NCAA Division I athletic department administrators and staff (N=309) \nparticipated in the study. The sample was comprised of 207 women (67.0%), 101 men \n(32.7%), and one person who did not indicate her or his sex (0.3%). The participants’ \nages ranged from 22 to 77 years (M = 38.33; SD = 11.60), and the mean organizational \ntenure was 7.96 years (SD = 7.90). Most of the sample was White (n=242, 78.3%), \nfollowed by African Americans (n=40, 12.9%), Latinos (n=10; 3.2%), Samoans (n=5, \n1.6%), Asian Americans (n=1; 0.3%), Native Americans (n=1; 0.3%), and persons who \ndid not report their race (n=10, 3.2%). With respect to sexual orientation, the majority of \nparticipants indicated they were heterosexual (n=269, 87.1%), followed by gay or \nlesbian (n=33, 10.6%), bisexual (n=5, 1.6%), and two (0.6%) persons who did not \nprovide their sexual orientation. Finally, 179 (57.9%) participants identified as an ally \nfor LGBT inclusion (57.9%), whereas 122 (39.5%) reported they were not allies, and 8 \n(2.6%) did not respond.  \nMeasures \nParticipants completed a questionnaire requesting them to provide their \ndemographic information and to respond to items measuring their OTE, extraversion, \ngeneral confidence, social justice orientation, type of media they consumed, the support \ntheir supervisors and coworkers showed for sexual orientation diversity, degree of sexual \norientation diversity in the department, the department’s commitment to diversity, their \n 81 \nattitudes toward sexual minorities, and championing behaviors related to LGBT \ninclusion.   \nPersonality. I used 6 items from Rammestedt and John’s (2007) instrument to \nmeasure OTE (3 items, with 1 reverse coded) and extraversion (3 items, with 1 reverse \ncoded). Sample items include ―I see myself as someone who avoids philosophical \ndiscussions‖ and ―I see myself as someone who is reserved.‖ To assess confidence, I \nused Wells and Tigert’s (1971) 3-item scale, with a sample item being ―I am confident in \nmy abilities‖. Other business scholars have consistently used this scale when examining \nattitudes toward controversial issues (Belleau et. al, 2001; Summer et al., 2006; Xu et al., \n2004; Xu, 2000). Responses were made on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored from 1 \n(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). All scales demonstrated acceptable reliability \n(OTE, α = .72; extraversion, α = .86, confidence, α = .85)  \n Personal values. To measure one’s personal values related to social justice, I \nrelied on four items from Rupp, Byrne, and Wadlington’s (2003) social justice \norientation scale. The scale is designed to assess the extent to which individuals are \naware of issues of fairness and equity around them. A sample item includes ―I am prone \nto notice people being treated unfairly in public.‖ Scale items are arranged in a Likert-\ntype format and range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). This scale had \nmoderate reliability (α = .61).  \nPresence of other allies. To determine the presence of allies in the workplace, I \nused items adapted from Cunningham and Sartore’s (2010) 3-item scale for coworker \nsupport for diversity (e.g., ―My supervisor really supports sexual orientation diversity in \n 82 \nthe department.‖) and their 3-item scale for supervisor support for diversity (e.g., My \ncoworkers are very supportive of sexual orientation diversity at work‖). I modified the \nitems to specifically reflect sexual orientation diversity, instead of general diversity \nsupport. Items were measured on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 \n(strongly agree). The scales for supervisor support (α = .75) and coworker support (α = \n.75) both demonstrated good reliability.  \nSexual orientation diversity. Drawing from Harrison and colleagues’ (Harrison, \nPrice, & Bell, 1998; Harrison, Price, Gavin, & Florey, 2002) and Cunningham (2011a, \n2011b), sexual orientation diversity was measured with a single item: ―As a whole, how \ndifferent are members of your athletic department with respect to sexual orientation.’’ \nResponses were made on a 7-point scale from 1 (very similar) to 7 (very different). \nHarrison et al. (1998, 2002) research consistently demonstrated the sound psychometrics \nof this measure. \nMedia type. One item was used to measure the type of media consumed. \nParticipants responded to the question, ―How would you describe the type of news \nmedia you consume?‖ on a 7-point scale from 1 (Conservative) to 7 (Liberal).  \nMarriage equality. Same-sex marriage is legal in six states—Massachusetts, \nConnecticut, Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. Sport organizations \nlocated in these states were coded as 1. States without such laws were coded 0.   \nAttitudes toward LGBT individuals. To assess attitudes toward sexual \nminorities, I adapted 5 items from Pittinsky, Rosenthal, and Montoya’s (2011) allophila \nscale, which assess positive attitudes toward minority groups. Participants indicated the \n 83 \ndegree to which they agreed or disagreed with items anchored from 1 (strongly disagree) \nto 7 (strongly agree).  Sample items include ―I think LGBT people should have the same \nrights as heterosexual people‖ and ―In general, I have positive attitudes about LGBT \npeople.‖ The reliability was acceptable (α = .83) for this scale. \nChampioning sexual orientation diversity. I adapted four items from \nCunningham and Sartore (2010) scale to measure the degree to which participants \nchampion sexual orientation diversity in university settings. While Cunningham and \nSartore measured championing in the context of general diversity initiatives, I altered the \nitems to reflect championing of initiatives related to sexual orientation diversity. A \nsample item is ―I try to overcome coworkers’ resistance to sexual orientation diversity \ninitiatives.‖ The items were rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly \ndisagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scale demonstrated high reliability (α = .90). \nOrganizational commitment to diversity. I assessed the organization’s \ncommitment to diversity by using McKay, Avery, & Morris’ (2008) four-item scale. \nScale items include ―I trust people in our department will be treated fairly,‖ ―My \ndepartment maintains a diversity friendly work environment,‖ ―My department respects \nthe views of all people,‖ and ―Top leaders demonstrate a visible commitment to \ndiversity.‖ Items were rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly \ndisagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scale showed high reliability (α = .91). \nProcedures \nPotential participants were first identified by using member contact information \navailable on university ally club websites, and contacting members of Allies in N4A \n 84 \n(National Athletic Academic Advisors Association), which is a national ally group \ncomprised of athletic academic advisors in collegiate athletics. This process resulted in \nthe identification of 100 allies from a variety of NCAA Division I athletic departments \nfrom across the United States. Next, I employed systematic random sampling to select \nnine other persons who worked in the athletic department with the ally who was \npreviously identified. This process resulted in a total sampling frame of 1000 persons \nfrom 100 different universities.  \nTo increase response rate, researchers recommend making multiple contacts with \npotential participants (Dillman, 2000). Thus, I mailed a pre-notification postcard, a study \npacket (i.e., cover letter, questionnaire, questionnaires for coworkers, and postage paid \nreturn envelopes); and second study packet to each person to encourage non-respondents \nto complete the questionnaire. A total of 233 returned the first questionnaire, and another \n76 responded during round 2, for a final sample of 309, or a 31.6 percent response rate—\nsome study packets (N=22) were returned because the address was incorrect or the \nperson no longer worked for the department.  \nSteps were taken to assess non-response bias. First, some researchers suggest late \nrespondents and non-respondents have similar characteristics, and as such, one can test \nfor non-response bias by examining differences between early and late responders \n(Rogelberg & Luong, 1998). Analysis of variance indicated the two groups did not differ \non any of the study variables. Furthermore, chi-square analyses indicate that differences \ndid not exist based on race or gender. Based on these results, non-response bias may not \nbe a significant concern (cf. Rogelberg & Stanton, 2007). \n 85 \nResults \nData Analysis \nConfirmatory factor analysis. I first conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to \nexamine the validity evidence of the scales. Results indicate that the model was a close \nfit to the data: χ2 (n = 527, df = 398) = 637.36, p < .001; χ2 / df = 1.60; confirmatory fit \nindex (CFI) = .95; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) (90% CI: .04, .05) \n= .05, p close = .94. All items significantly loaded to their respective factors. I also tested \na three-factor model. In this model, the three latent factors included (a) micro-level \nfactors (i.e., OTE, extraversion, confidence, SJO), (b) meso-level factors (supervisor \nsupport, coworker support, CTD), and (c) the ally support variables (i.e., attitudes \ntoward sexual minorities, championing behaviors). This model was a poor fit to the data: \nχ2 (n = 527, df = 431) = 2306.93, p < .001; χ2 / df = 5.35; CFI = .63; RMSEA (90% CI: \n.11, .12) = .12, p close < .001. Finally, I tested a single-factor model in which all items \nloaded on one latent factor. This model was also a poor fit to the data: χ2 (n = 527, df = \n434) = 3748.22, p < .001; χ2 / df = 8.64; CFI = .35; RMSEA (90% CI: .15, .16) = .16, p \nclose < .001. These findings offer further validity evidence for the measures used in the \nstudy. \nDescriptive statistics. The means, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations \nare provided in Table 1. Results for the entire sample indicate that mean scores for most \nof the variables were high, with the expectation of championing (M =4.01, SD =1.53) \nand sexual orientation diversity (M = 3.02; SD = 1.80). A one sample t-test indicated \nthat all other variables were all significantly higher than the midpoint of the scale: OTE, \n 86 \nt (307) = 8.82, p < .001; extraversion, t (307) = 14.97, p < .001; confidence, t (307) = \n43.36, p < .001; SJO, t (307) = 26.83, p < .001; supervisor support, t (307) = 2.87, p = \n.004; coworker support, t (307) = 11.08, p < .001; media type, t (306) = 9.45, p < .001; \nand attitudes toward sexual minorities, t (308) = 23.72, p < .001. The scale for \nchampioning behaviors was not significantly different from the midpoint of the scale, t \n(307) = 0.56, p = .875; and, SOD was significantly lower than the scale’s midpoint, t \n(304) = -9.56, p < .001.  With the exception of marriage equality, all the antecedents held \nmoderate to large associations with attitudes toward for sexual minorities. \nHypothesis Testing \nHypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling (SEM). I included \nmarriage equality, media type, SOD, supervisor support, coworker support, SJO, \nconfidence, extraversion, OTE, sex, and race variables as exogenous variables, all of \nwhich correlated with one another. Following Marsh, Wen, and Hau’s (2004) guidelines \nfor interactions, I then created the commitment to diversity × attitudes toward sexual \nminorities interaction term using the standardized scale items for the two variables. To \ncreate this term, I used the four standardized item indicators for both commitment to \ndiversity and attitudes toward sexual minorities. Considering the scale for attitudes had \nfive items, I parceled the fourth and fifth item indicators, with the parcel representing \n―an aggregate-level indicator comprised of the sum (or average) of two or more items, \nresponses or behaviors‖ (Little, Cunningham, Shahar, & Widaman, 2002, p. 152). \nAttitudes toward sexual minorities and championing behaviors were both specified as \nlatent variables.  \n 87 \n Results of the SEM indicated that the data were a close fit to the data: χ2 (n = \n860, df = 676) = 1146.27, p < .001; χ2 / df = 1.70; CFI = .92; RMSEA (90% CI: .04, .05) \n= .05, pclose = .80. The model accounted for 56% of the variance in attitudes toward \nsexual minorities and 64% of the variance in championing behaviors. An illustrative \nsummary is presented in Figure 4. \n The first six hypotheses related to micro-level factors (i.e., demographics, \npersonality, and personal values). Hypothesis 1a predicted that race would be negatively \nassociated with attitudes toward sexual minorities. This hypothesis was not supported, as \nthe relationship between race and attitudes was not significant (β = -.83, p = .10). \nHypothesis 1b, which predicted sex would be associated with attitudes toward sexual \nminorities, was supported (β = -.18, p < .001), as women expressed more positive \nattitudes than men. \nWith respect to personality variables, Hypothesis 2a predicted OTE would be \npositively associated with attitudes toward sexual minorities. This relationship was \nsignificant (β = .38, p < .001), thus supporting the hypothesis. However, Hypotheses 2b \nand 2c were not supported, such that the relationships between attitudes toward sexual \nminorities and extraversion (β = .07, p = .28) and attitudes toward sexual minorities and \nconfidence (β = .03, p = .56) were not significant.  \nHypothesis 3 expected SJO to be positively associated with attitudes toward \nsexual minorities. The relationship between these two variables was not significant (β = \n.12, p = .07), therefore this hypothesis was not supported. \n 88 \n The next three hypotheses examined meso-level factors (i.e., SOD, supervisor \nsupport, coworker support) related to attitudes toward sexual minorities. Of these, only \nHypothesis 5a was supported. Specifically, the relationship between supervisors support \nand attitudes toward sexual minorities was significant (β = .21, p = .003), while the \nrelationships between SOD and attitudes toward sexual minorities (H4; β = .08, p = .14), \nand coworker support and attitudes toward sexual minorities (H5b; β = .02, p =.77) were \nnot significant.   \n Next, Hypotheses 6 and 7 examined macro-level factors. As expected, the type of \nmedia consumed did relate to attitudes toward sexual minorities (β = .18, p = .002). \nThus, hypothesis 6 was supported. However, marriage equality was not associated with \nattitudes toward sexual minorities (β = -.02 p =. 73). Therefore, Hypothesis 7 was not \nsupported. \nAs expected, the relationship between attitudes toward sexual minorities and \nchampioning behaviors was significant (β = .79, p < .001). Thus, Hypothesis 8, which \nstated attitudes toward sexual minorities would be positively associated with \nchampioning behaviors, was supported.   \nFinally, Hypothesis 9 was not supported. The attitudes toward sexual minorities x \ncommitment to diversity interaction and championing behaviors was not significant (β = \n.01, p = .77). Thus, the department’s commitment to diversity did not moderate the \nrelationship between attitudes toward sexual minorities and championing behaviors. \nThough not hypothesized, the direct relationship between commitment to diversity and \nchampioning behaviors was significant (β = -.08 p =. 03). \n 89 \nDiscussion \n Scholars and practitioners alike are beginning to devote more attention to the \nissue of workplace inclusion (cf. Shore et al., 2011; Ragins, 2004). The motivation to do \nso primarily stems from the belief that creating inclusive work environments will lead to \na host of positive outcomes—for both the individual employee (Griffith & Hebl, 2002; \nMartinez & Hebl, 2010; Ragins, 2008) and the organization as a whole (Cunningham, \n2011a, 2011b; King & Cortina, 2010). In this study, I contribute to this line of inquiry by \nfocusing on antecedents and outcomes of employee support for LGBT inclusion. I drew \nfrom the multilevel model developed in Study 2, and explored how micro- (i.e., race, \nsex, OTE, extraversion, confidence, SJO), meso- (i.e., SOD, supervisor support, \ncoworker support), and macro-level (i.e., type of media consumed, same-sex marriage \nlaws) factors influence ally support for LGBT inclusion among sport employees. In \naddition, I examined if these positive attitudes toward sexual minorities affected \nbehavioral support for LGBT inclusion in the workplace (i.e., championing behaviors).  \nFindings from the study offered support for 5 of the 13 hypotheses. Specifically, \nsex, OTE, supervisor support, and type of media consumed were related to attitudinal \nsupport for LGBT inclusion, and these attitudes positively associated with championing \nbehaviors. Based on these results, those who are female, are open to new experiences, \nhave supervisors who support LGBT inclusion, and consume more liberal media are \nmore likely to express positive attitudes toward sexual minorities. \nIn addition, one of the primary aims of this research was to test the model \ndeveloped in Study 2. And, while not all hypothesized associations were significant in \n 90 \nthe final model, the bivariate correlations show all the study variables, except marriage \nequality, related to attitudes toward sexual minorities. These results further buttress the \nassertion that the factors identified at the micro- (i.e., demographics, personality, values), \nmeso- (i.e., SOD, supervisor support, coworker support) and macro-level (i.e., type of \nmedia consumption) influence one’s attitudes toward sexual minorities.  \nThere are some explanations for why some associations were not observed in the \nSEM model.  First, findings from the SEM model failed to show that race related to \nattitudes toward sexual minorities. This was surprising considering the significant \namount of literature that suggests there should be a racial difference. Some researchers \noffer suggestions for why a racial difference may not be observed. First, Schulte and \nBattle (2004) contend underlying beliefs, such as traditional gender beliefs or religious \nideologies, may contribute more to attitudes than race alone. This argument may explain \nthe findings.  \n The measures used in the study might also explain why we some of the expected \nrelationships were not significant. For instance, the SJO measure’s reliability may have \nbeen a reason I did not observe a relationship between SJO and attitudes toward sexual \nminorities. Perhaps, if more items were included on the scale, the association would \nhave been significant. Indeed, research suggests Cronbach’s alpha estimation of \nreliability increases with scale length (Cronbach, 1951; Voss, Stem & Fotopoulos, \n2000). Furthermore, Swailes and McIntyre-Bhatty (2002) provide evidence that when \nthe number of items is six or less, the effect on alpha is particularly noticeable. Thus, the \nlow number of scale items most likely caused the relative moderate coefficient. \n 91 \n Given the limited theoretical evidence supporting the linkage between confidence \nand attitudes toward sexual minorities, it is not especially surprising that this relationship \nwas not significant. This hypothesis was primarily based on findings from Study 1. As \nthe results indicate, those qualitative findings did not transfer here.    \n With respect to the SOD, a positive relationship between this form of diversity \nand attitudes toward sexual minorities may have been difficult to detect given the low \nmean of the SOD variable (M = 3.02). This indicates the athletic departments in the \nsample employed few sexual minorities, or that participants were unaware of their \nLGBT counterparts.  \nThe low number of participants who resided in states with marriage equality may \nalso explain why this variable was not significant. Therefore, to increase the number, I \nalso included states that ban employment discrimination based on sexual orientation; \nhowever, this relationship was not significant. While these finding were unexpected, \nthey may emphasize the importance of individual employees in creating more inclusive \nwork environments, as state and national laws did not significantly impact one’s \nattitudes toward sexual minorities. Moreover, the findings suggest that the focus of the \ncurrent study—individual employees’ impact on LGBT inclusion—was appropriate and \nwarranted.   \nIt is interesting that the organization’s commitment to diversity did not moderate \nthe relationship between attitudes toward sexual minorities and championing behaviors, \nbut it did have a direct effect, albeit in the negative direction. This was surprising \nconsidering participants in the Study 1 felt formal policies would encourage more \n 92 \nemployees to promote LGBT inclusion. However, based on the findings, it appears \nemployees are more likely to behave in supportive manners when the organization does \nnot show a strong commitment to diversity. Perhaps, as a possible explanation for these \nunexpected findings, when organizations have already created an inclusive climate, there \nis a less of a need for champions. Thus, an inclusive climate may have a greater impact \non reducing resistance among people with negative attitudes toward sexual minorities or \nwho oppose LGBT inclusion initiatives. In the following space, I provide contributions \nand implications of these findings and offer suggestions for future research. \nContributions, Implications, and Limitations \n This study makes several theoretical and practical contributions. First, I add to \nthe limited body of research examining antecedents of LGBT-inclusion in the \nworkplace. This study is unique, though, in that I focused on factors related to support \nfor LGBT inclusion among heterosexual employees rather than outcomes associated \nwith organizational forms of support, the latter of which characterizes most analyses of \nLGBT inclusion. In doing so, I empirically tested the propositions of multilevel model \nfor ally support that I developed in Study 2. Thus, this study provided empirical support \nfor the model and also identified areas that need further research. Finally, this is one of \nthe few studies that examines the influence of positive attitudes toward sexual minorities \n(for an exception see Fingerhut, 2011), and how such attitudes can impact behavioral \nforms of support for LGBT inclusion.  \n From a practical standpoint, the positive relationship between supervisor support \nfor sexual orientation diversity and attitudes toward sexual minorities is significant. \n 93 \nIndeed, this finding suggests leaders are in a unique position to influence the behaviors \nof their employees. Specifically, as was mentioned earlier, setting an overt example of \nacceptance in the workplace encourages others to exhibit similar attitudes and behaviors. \nThus, organizations should devote more attention to providing educational programs and \nseminars that train managers how to be champions for sexual orientation diversity in the \nworkplace.  \nAlthough this research provides several contributions, it is also important to \nrecognize its limitations. First, the response rate (31.6%) in Study 3 might signal non-\nresponse bias; however, I previously provided data showing this is likely not the case. \nSecond, the sample consisted of adults working in university settings, which is \nsometimes described as a liberal context. Indeed, the mean scores indicated the \nparticipants had more liberal political leanings and tended to consume more liberal news \nmedia. However, they were also more likely to be more religious, which is generally \nrelated to negative attitudes toward sexual minorities (Herek, 2009).  Future researches \nshould attempt to broaden the sampling frame so that people with a variety of political \norientations are included in the research. Third, I collected data on a single \nquestionnaire, which increases the probability for common method variance. However, a \nnumber of items were reverse coded to mitigate these effects. Further, given the three-\nfactor CFA was a poor fit to the data suggests that common method variance should not \nbe a significant concern (Korsgaard & Roberson, 1995).  \nIn addition, I did not directly assess one’s contact with LGBT individuals outside \nthe workplace. Researchers have consistently shown such interactions strongly relate to \n 94 \nattitudes toward sexual minorities (Cunningham & Melton, in press-a; Herek & \nCapitanio, 1996; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), and ally behaviors (Fingerhut, 2011). \nInstead, I chose to indirectly examine contact by measuring the sexual orientation \ndiversity of the workplace. Thus, these findings offer insights that go beyond what is \nalready firmly established in the literature.  \nFinally, the same person responded to scale items assessing the predictor \nvariables and the outcomes variables, thus allowing for the possibility of common \nmethod bias. This could increase the possibility that participants responded in a socially \ndesirable fashion, and as such, some researchers contend that responses to questionnaire \nitems may not be completely accurate or in accordance with participants’ true feelings \nand beliefs (Crowne & Marlowe, 1964). However, the questionnaire was completed \nvoluntarily and private; therefore, it is assumed that participants responded honestly and \ntruthfully to the questions asked. \n \n 95 \nCHAPTER V \nGENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n \n  \nInclusive work environments have a tremendous effect on work-related outcomes \nfor sexual minorities such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment; \nfurthermore, working in such an atmosphere can significantly improve employees’ \nphysical and mental health (Cunningham, 2011a; Herek & Garnets, 2007; Meyer 2003; \nRagins, 2008). The benefits of inclusion also have a considerable effect on \norganizational processes and performance, particularly in the case of LGBT-inclusion \n(Cunningham, 2011a, 2011b). Consequently, it is critical to understand ways to create \nand maintain inclusion in the workplace, such as implementing non-discrimination \npolicies or ensuring employees promote inclusive practices, as they directly impact \nemployees who are LGBT and the organization as a whole. In addition, knowing what \nfactors have the most meaningful impact on support for LGBT employees would be \nadvantageous to organizations because these efforts should provide a safe and equitable \nworkplace (Brooks & Edwards, 2009), and communicate to all employees that \nintolerance or prejudice will not be accepted in the organization (Martinez & Hebl, \n2010). \nMuch of the research on sexual orientation in the workplace focuses on \norganizational forms of support for LGBT inclusion (Button, 2001; Griffith & Hebl, \n2002), with limited attention examining how attitudes and behaviors of individual \nemployees impact perceptions of acceptance and fairness. This is an unfortunate \noversight as emerging literature shows employee support tends to have a greater impact \n 96 \non job satisfaction and overall life satisfaction for sexual minorities than formal polices.  \nMoreover, theoretical and empirical arguments contend individuals are vital to the \nsuccess of diversity initiatives (Avery, 2011). In fact, qualitative investigations \nexamining teammates and coaches, in both male (Anderson, 2011) and female (Fink et \nal., 2012) sport settings revealed the actions of just one person can inspire inclusion and \nacceptance among an athletic team, even in the absence of formal inclusion polices. \nThus, individuals are key in creating safe workspaces because they can (a) actively \ncombat instances of prejudice and discrimination, or (b) serve as passive bystanders \nwhose inaction limits the effectiveness of inclusive policies. Understanding what factors \ncan inspire employee action is important, as it can help organizations identity potential \nchampions and allies for LGBT-inclusion.   \nAs such, the purpose of my dissertation was to advance the inclusion literature by \nexamining factors that relate to LGBT-inclusion in sport organizations. I did this by \nconducting three studies. In Study 1, I examined perceptions of employee support among \nLGBT sport employees. The participants indicated that various micro-level (i.e., \ndemographics, personality characteristics, personal experiences with LGBT individuals) \nand meso-level (organizational culture for diversity, support of relevant others) factors \ninfluenced an individual’s support for LGBT-inclusive policies and practices. \nFurthermore, from the participants’ perceptions, power meaningfully influenced these \ndynamics, such that individuals in low status positions within the athletic department \nwere hesitant to show support for LGBT equality. However, those who did champion \nLGBT inclusive initiatives successfully modeled supportive behaviors and positive \n 97 \nattitudes toward LGBT individuals, vocally opposed discriminatory treatment, and \nprovided sexual minorities with a safe space at work. Thus, according to the participants, \nthese champions significantly influenced their daily work experiences and overall \nsatisfaction.  \nIn Study 2, I develop a multilevel model to explain support for LGBT-inclusion \namong sport employees.  Based on the findings in Study 1 and relevant literature, I \nidentified factors at the macro-level (i.e., mass media, climate for sexual orientation \ndiversity), meso-level (i.e., sexual orientation diversity, presence of other allies), and \nmicro-level (i.e., personality, personal values, attitudes toward LGBT individuals, \ncontact with LGBT individuals, and personal motivations) that relate to support for \nLGBT inclusion. In addition, I differentiate between attitudinal and behavioral support \nfor LGBT equality, and discussed various issues that may encourage allies to engage in \nmore championing behaviors, such as one’s status in the department, expectancy beliefs, \nand the diversity culture in the department.   \nFinally in Study 3, I empirically tested many of the propositions outlined in the \nmultilevel model explaining support for LGBT inclusion (developed in Study 2). The \nresults from this study show, with the exception of marriage equality, all the micro- \n(demographics, personality characteristics, personal values), meso- (sexual orientation \ndiversity, presence of other allies), and macro-level (type of media exposure) factors \nunivariately related to attitudes toward sexual minorities. However, based on the SEM, \nonly sex, one’s openness to experiences, supervisor support, and type of media exposure \n 98 \nwere significantly associated with attitudes toward sexual minorities, and these attitudes \nsignificantly related to championing behaviors.  \nContributions \n This body of research makes several contributions to the LGBT inclusion \nliterature. First, it extends the literature by examining employee support for LGBT \ninclusion in the workplace. All three studies provided empirical and theoretical evidence \nthat employees make a meaningful impact on the creation and sustainability of inclusive \nwork environments for sexual minorities. The findings in Study 1 are particularly \nnoteworthy, as they revealed the perceptions and lived experiences of sexual minorities \nworking within the sport industry—a group that is oftentimes neglected in the sport \nmanagement literature (Cunningham, 2012: Fink et al., 2012; Krane, 2001). At times, \nwhen investigating issues related to marginalized groups, scholars may inadvertently \nignore research questions or endeavors that are relevant to a certain population. Thus, by \nfirst conducting a qualitative investigation with LGBT sport employees, I was able to \n―listen to their voices‖ and gain a deeper understanding of their perceptions of inclusion \n(hooks, 1980). This is a warranted addition to the literature, as most work in this area has \nrelied on quantitative methods (Button, 2001; Griffith & Hebl, 2002; Ragins, 2004; \nRagins et al., 2007), or focused on heterosexual samples (Russel, 2011).  \nSecond, this dissertation also provides new theoretical and empirical insights \nconcerning factors related to positive attitudes toward sexual minorities, which offers a \ndrastic contrast to the pleather of research examining sexual prejudice, its predictors, \nconsequences, and moderators (see Herek, 2009 for a review). Indeed, research has \n 99 \nconsistently shown high levels of prejudice are associated with various forms of \ndiscriminatory behavior. This prejudice can then influence one’s support for diversity \ninitiatives in an organization (Avery, 2011; Harrison et al., 2006). For example, \nCunningham and Sartore (2010) observed that individuals with higher levels of racial \nprejudice and sexual prejudice were less likely to engage in behaviors that championed \ndiversity initiatives (see also Harrison et al., 2006). However, though this work provides \nstrong evidence that high levels of sexual prejudice relate to fewer champion efforts, it \nshould not necessarily be assumed that low sexual prejudice would translate to \nadditional support for such initiatives. In fact, Cunningham and Melton (in press-b) \nargue, ―expressing a little sexual prejudice is akin to being a little bit pregnant,‖ such \nthat low levels of sexual prejudice are still likely to influence one’s behaviors.  Many \npsychology researchers have supported this notion empirically, as their findings suggest \nthe absence of a negative does not equate to the presence of a positive (Watson, Clark, & \nTelegen, 1998). Therefore, this study acknowledges support is distinct from low \nprejudice, and extends the literature by focusing on positive attitudes toward sexual \nminorities. \nIn addition, this work makes a unique contribution to the ally literature because it \nconsiders individuals who may not identify as allies for LGBT inclusion, but nonetheless \nexpress support for sexual minorities and LGBT equality. Indeed, according to \nparticipants in Study 1, most of the supportive employees had no formal ally training, \ndid not identify as such, yet these individuals were still perceived as making a positive \nimpact on inclusion in the workplace. Thus, by also examining the attitudes and \n 100 \nbehaviors of employees who are not self-identified allies, researchers are able to develop \na more complete knowledge of the influences related to employee support for LGBT \ninclusion. \nFinally, from a theoretical perspective, the findings and arguments made in all \nthree studies buttress the assertion that multilevel factors influence employee support for \nLGBT inclusion. Specifically, participant perceptions in Study 1 suggested individual \nfactors, as well as well as the organizational environment contributed to one’s level of \nsupport for LGBT inclusion. Furthermore, many of these perceptions were supported, \nboth theoretically and empirically in Studies 2 and 3 respectively. Specially, results from \nStudy 3 suggest allies are more likely to be employees who are women, open to new \nexperiences, have supervisors who support LGBT inclusion, and consume more liberal \nmedia. Collectively, the three studies included in my dissertation provided further \nevidence that scholars should account for multilevel influences when examining human \nbehavior in organizations.   \nImplications \n The studies offer several practical implications which can benefit sport \norganizations in their quest to become for inclusive for sexual minorities. For instance, \nsport organizations should realize the importance of identifying allies in the workplace, \nas these employees are key to creating safe and accepting work environments for sexual \nminorities. This can be accomplished by engaging in open and honest conversations \nregarding sexual orientation diversity in the workplace. Specially, mangers should \neffectively communicate both the consequences of discrimination, as well as the benefits \n 101 \nof inclusion to their employees. Doing so can tremendously affect attitudes toward \nsexual minorities, which should then increase championing behaviors.  \n Secondly, for employees who do express an interest in championing LGBT \nequality, resources should be available for them to do so. Namely, organizations should \noffer training and educational programs that enhance employees’ efforts to promote \ninclusion. As mentioned by the LGBT employees in Study 1, while all forms of support \nare appreciated, certain actions are more successfully in establishing accepting and equal \nworkspaces for sexual minorities.  \n In addition to providing the necessary resources, organizations should also \nexamine barriers to inclusion. For instance, do low-level employees feel as though their \njobs would be in jeopardy if they took a stand? Or, do employees feel they will be \nsocially stigmatized if they support LGBT equality? To mitigate these concerns, leaders \nshould make concerted efforts to model inclusive attitudes and behaviors. Furthermore, \nleadership that sets this example demonstrates how these behaviors are appropriate and \nexpected, and as shown in Study 3, can have a positive impact on attitudes toward sexual \nminorities.  \n Finally, sport organizations need to be aware of what images and content their \nemployees are consuming in the media, as findings from Study 3 highlight, media \nmessages can have a significant effect on attitudes toward sexual minorities. And, while \nmanagers cannot forbid their employees from watching the Fox News channel, they can \ncertainly expose them to educational videos or speakers that may present LGBT issues in \na more positive light. For instance, athletic departments could invite prominent allies, \n 102 \nsuch as Hudson Taylor to conduct training workshops on how to combat sexual \nprejudice in sport, or have ―out‖ athletes come and share their experiences with the staff. \nHaving the opportunities to hear counter narratives may inspire employees to reevaluate \nhow they view sexual monitories.  \nFuture Research \nFinally, there are several avenues for future research. First, additional research \nshould explore the associations among the study variables and other forms of employee \nbehavior, such as resistance, compliance, and cooperation (Herscovitch & Meyer, 2002).  \nDoing so would allow for a better understanding of what differentiates a ―champion‖ \nfrom a ―cooperator.‖ Considering participants in Study 1 noted the importance of allies \n(akin to champions) versus friends (akin to cooperators), this is a warranted area of \ninquire.  \nSecond, future investigation should empirically examine the motivations of allies \nin workplace. To date, most work related to this issue has been qualitative (Russell, \n2011), or focused on why individuals become allies outside the work setting. However, \nthere may be more personal risk associated with championing LGBT inclusion in the \nworkplace: allies may fear they will be ostracized by their coworkers, or that they may \nbe disadvantaged in future job opportunities. Pat Griffin, respected sport scholar and \nadvocate for LGBT rights, makes this point when discussing the absence of female allies \nin sport. She notes that, due to the combined effect of heterosexism and sexism, women \nmay not advocate for LGBT coaches and players because they may be labeled a lesbian \n(Griffin, 2011). Having such a label can then lead to a host of negative outcomes, such \n 103 \nas job terminations, becoming the victim of negative recruiting tactics, or social isolation \nwithin the athletic department (Sartore & Cunningham, 2010). Thus, it is interesting to \nunderstand why allies have taken on this risk so to ensure workplaces are inclusive for \nLGBT employees.  \nThird, arguments from this dissertation suggest even if employees have positive \nattitudes toward LGBT inclusiveness, they oftentimes face a number of impediments to \nengaging in championing behaviors. Thus, future research should examine if educational \nseminars, guest speakers, or ally training workshops can results in more championing \nbehaviors among heterosexual allies.  \nFinally, the sample was limited to athletic department administrators and staff. \nFuture researchers should consider examining these relationships among coaches, \nplayers, or industry professions, as these are all key players in making sport a more \ninclusive environment.  \nConclusions \nThe purpose of this dissertation was to examine the antecedents and outcomes of \nemployee support for LGBT inclusion in the workplace. The findings highlight how \nmultilevel factors influence employee attitudes toward sexual minorities, which can then \ninfluence championing behaviors. In addition, the results provided here provide new \ntheoretical and practical insights regarding individual support for diversity and inclusion \ninitiatives. Finally, given the limited research examining employee or ally support, I \nhave attempted to spark more scholarly interest into an area of study that has a plethora \nof future research opportunities.   \n 104 \nREFERENCES \n \nAgyemang K., Singer J.N., & DeLorme J.

Their concerns are not without merit, considering the \nsignificant amount of evidence in both the academic and popular press that depicts how \npersons who are LGBT suffer discrimination within sport organizations and on the \nplaying field, where at times, they report instances of physical abuse.   \nThe purpose of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of these issues. Thus, \nthis paper presents a review of literature examining the intersection of sexual orientation \nand sport. To do so, I first define key terms and provide a historical overview of how \nsexual orientation has been conceptualized in modern societies. Then, I expand on \nconcepts such as sexual stigma and sexual prejudice, including a definition of the terms \nand their antecedents and outcomes. The discussion then focuses on issues related to \nsexual orientation in the workplace. From there, I discuss positive signs of change, with \nparticular attention devoted to how sport employees can create more inclusive sport \n 132 \nenvironments for persons who are LGBT by offering support, such as supervisor \nsupport, coworker support, and ally support.  Such a review will identify gaps in the \nliterature and focus attention on issues that warrant further research.  \nKey Terms and Conceptualizations \n To begin, it is necessary to explain the terminology that appears throughout the \nreview of literature and dissertation. I will primarily use the terms LGB (i.e., lesbian, \ngay, and bisexual) or LGBT (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, and members of the trans \ncommunity). In general, I will only use the term LGB when discussing specific \npopulations or proportions of individuals who are lesbian, gay, and bisexual in the \nUnited States. In most other cases, I use the term LGBT to include individuals in the \ntrans community (e.g. transgender, transsexual, and gender queer). Relying on such \nterminology is not meant to suggest individuals in the LGBT community share the same \nor similar experiences; rather, it is simply an attempt to remain consistent with the past \nresearchers and theorist who refer to persons who are LGBT in the collective. Therefore, \nI will follow suit when appropriate. Finally, I also use the term sexual minority \ninterchangeably with the phrase individual who is LGBT. This term is preferable to \n―homosexual‖, as the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association \n(2010) considers the later term ―to be associated with negative stereotypes, pathology, \nand the reduction of people’s identities to their sexual behavior‖ (p. 75).  \nPopulation  \nMost researchers agree that between 4 to 17 percent of the United States \npopulation identifies as LGB (Gonsiorek & Weinrich, 1991). This is a sizable amount \n 133 \nconsidering that the 2010 census estimated the US population to be 310 million people. \nThus, to quantify the percentage, between 12.4 and 52.7 million US citizens were LGBT \nat this time. This percentage is comparable to estimates for Asian American (3%), \nAfrican American (12%), and Hispanic (15%) populations (Day & Greene, 2008), \nthereby illustrating the prevalence of LGB persons in the workforce. As such, scholars \ndevote considerable attention to understanding the experiences of LGBT people across a \nvariety of social contexts, including the sport setting.   \n When considering the previously mentioned percentage, it is important to \nunderstand how one conceptualizes being lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Historically, scholars \nand laypersons alike have viewed sexual orientation as a binary construct—one either \nbehaves in a heterosexual or homosexual manner (Lubensky, Holland, Wiethof, & \nCrosby, 2004). However, Kinsey and his colleagues challenged this notion, and argued \nsexual orientation existed on a continuum from completely homosexual or completely \nheterosexual sexual behaviors. This view allowed for variations in the heterosexual-\nhomosexual binary to be recognized and opened the possibility for bisexuality.  \n Most researchers now conceptualize sexual orientation on a similar continuum; \nhowever, this approach remains limited because it ignores the multidimensional aspect \nof sexual orientation. Specifically, Kinsey and his colleagues’ measurement only focuses \non the behavior component of sexual orientation, and fails to consider other dimensions, \nincluding self-image, fantasies, and attractions (Lubensky et al., 2004; Ragins & \nWiethhoff, 2005). At times, these elements can interact in such a way that it becomes \ndifficult to classify someone as heterosexual or homosexual. For instance, a woman can \n 134 \nhave attractions and fantasies for both men and women, exhibit homosexual behaviors \nexclusively, yet view herself as a heterosexual. Variation such as this can make it \ndifficult to obtain and accurate estimate of the LGBT population. \n The manner in which sexual orientation is conceptualized not only has \nimplications for determining the size of the population, it can also influence one’s \nattitudes toward LGBT individuals (e.g., Haslam, Rothschild, & Ernst, 2002; Jayaratne \net al., 2006). Thus, to gain a more complete understanding of prejudice directed at sexual \nminorities it is necessary to examine how researchers conceptualize sexual stigma. \nSexual Stigma \nIn the sexual stigma framework, Herek (2009) draws from Goffman’s (1963) \naccount of the basic definition of stigma. In this original piece, he emphasizes that a \nstigma is social constructed and refers to ―an undesired differentness‖ (p. 5) and ―an \nattribute that is deeply discrediting‖ (p. 3).  Because social stigmas have socially \nconstructed meanings, they can vary depending on the situation or context. However, \npower relations within a society significantly influence the meanings stigmas hold. \nWhen compared to others in society, stigmatized individuals are typically allowed less \nvalued resources, have limited influence over others, and social structures and processes \nmake it difficult for them to control their own fate. Thus, in the sexual stigma and sexual \nprejudice framework, stigma refers to the ―negative regard and inferior status that \nsociety collectively accords to people who posses a particular characteristic or belong to \na particular group or category… stigma constitutes shared knowledge about which \n 135 \nattributes and categories are valued by society, which ones are denigrated, and how \ntheses values vary across situations‖ (Herek, 2009, p. 66). \nSexual stigma is a particular from of stigma and is associated with any behavior, \nidentity, or attraction that is not heterosexual. Similar to other stigmas, it is accompanied \nby a set of social roles and expectations, which dictate how sexual minorities interact \nwith others in society. And, due to the devalued status the stigma produces, sexual \nminorities are negatively stereotyped and afforded little status and power in society. \nFurthermore, regardless of whether one personally endorses society’s negative view of \nsexual minorities, virtually all members of society recognize that LGBT people endure \nstigmatization to varying degrees.  \nHeterosexism \nThe power differentials that characterize sexual stigma are perpetuated by \ninstitutional practices and ideological systems embedded in society, and are referred to \nas heterosexism. Heterosexism has historically manifested in religious, legal, and \nmedical discourses, and ensures sexual minorities have less power and value than \nheterosexuals.  This is done through two processes. First, within these discourses, sexual \nminorities are made invisible because it is assumed that all people are heterosexual. \nSecond, if lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are acknowledged, heterosexism perpetuates \nthe belief that this behavior is abnormal and unnatural, when compared to heterosexual \nbehavior, and thus inferior (Herek, 2009). It is important to note, although sexual stigma \nremains ubiquitous in modern society, it is frequently challenged, and some institutional \nmanifestations have disappeared over time. In the space below, I provide a brief \n 136 \nhistorical account of the operation of heterosexism through various social institutions \nincluding religion, law, and psychiatry.  \n Heterosexism and religion. In the United States, Christianity has also been the \ndominant religion. One aspect of traditional Christianity is the condemnation of \nhomosexual behavior. This opposition toward homosexual acts was once part of a larger \ncondemnation of a whole class of behaviors including sexual conduct with no intent of \nprocreation (e.g. masturbation), sexual relations before marriage (e.g., fornication), not \nsanctioned sexual relations during marriage (e.g. adultery), and marital sex that focused \non sensual gratification (e.g., any intercourse position except the one that involves a man \nlying on top of a woman). Around the eleventh century, these behaviors were classified \nunder the rubric of ―sodomy.‖ By the late twelfth century, most religious and secular \ninstitutions considered these acts as ―sins against nature‖ (Boswell, 1980).  \nTo date, homosexuality remains a subject of intense religious antipathy; \nhowever, the church no longer condemns some acts once considered as sodomy (Herek \net al., 2007). According to most religious teachings, being lesbian, gay, or bisexual is \nnot, in itself, considered to be a sin. Instead, allowing oneself to act on his or her \nhomosexual feelings by engaging in a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex \nwould classify as a sin. Thus, to be welcomed in the church, individuals who are LGB \nmust display heterosexual behaviors or remain celibate (Herek et al., 2007).   \nSome denominations have also expressed opposition to laws prohibiting \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. For instance, the Catholic Church advocates \nthat people who are LGBT should not be allowed to adopt or foster children, or serve as \n 137 \nteacher or athletic coaches (Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, 1992). In the late \n1970’s, members of what came to be known as the Religious Right or the Christian \nRight fought to repeal antidiscrimination laws in Dade County (Florida) aimed at \nprotecting employment rights for lesbians and gay men. By the late 1990’s, increased \nanimosity and political strength by members and supporters of the Christian Right led to \nseveral states adopting anti-LGBT laws through voter initiatives. In contrast to the \nprevious examples, there are other denominations that welcome LGBT members. For \nexample, Unitarians, the United Church of Christ, and Reform Judaism accept sexual \nminorities into their ministry and bless same-sex marriages or unions (Dewan, 2005). In \naddition, in several Protestant denominations, certain congregations label themselves as \n―open and affirming‖ of individuals who are LGBT. \nHeterosexism in the law. By and large, the legal system in the United States has \nrelied on traditional religious views of homosexuality and during different times in \nhistory, has defined same-sex behavior as criminal, excluded same-sex relationships \nfrom family law, and condoned or encouraged discrimination based on sexual \norientation. Laws that codify sexual stigma have come in a variety of forms including (a) \nlaws prohibiting or restricting two consenting adults from engaging in sexual relations, \n(b) laws that deny basic civil liberties to individuals who are LGBT, and (c) laws that \nperpetuate the power differential between heterosexuals and members of the LGBT \ncommunity (Herek et al., 2007).  \nBeginning in the thirteenth century, laws in various European countries began to \ncriminalize acts of sodomy (Fone, 2000). Over the next few centuries men suspected of \n 138 \nhomosexual conduct were prosecuted, and in several instances, executed for their \nbehavior (Fone, 2000). Starting in the late eighteenth century, women could also be \nprosecuted solely because they engaged in a same-sex sexual relationship.  Laws in the \nAmerican colonies mirrored European laws, in that sodomy was considered a \n―wickedness not to be named‖, and was punishable by death (Katz, 1976). By and large, \nthe colonial laws pertained to acts conducted by men. These laws carried over to state \nlaws created in the 1700s and 1800s—some of which remained in until the U.S. \nSupreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in 2003 (Lawrence et al., v. Texas, 2003).   \nAfter World War II, stigma and prejudice directed toward sexual minorities \nbegan to intensify as the media began to devote considerable coverage to sexual crimes. \nIt is important to note, police records to not indicate in sexual crimes during this era; \nhowever, the media routinely reported sensationalized accounts of several brutal sexual \nmurders of children. In response to these news reports, Americans demanded law \nofficials take action against sexual deviants, and in the public’s opinion, sexual \nminorities were akin to child molesters, rapists, and sexual murders. Thus, these \nindividuals were all labeled ―sexual psychopaths‖, and sexual minorities faced being \narrested and subjected to sexual psychopath statutes during a time known as the sex \ncrime panics.  \nDuring this period, a person convicted as a sexual psychopath could be \nincarcerated until the individual was considered to be ―cured‖ of her or his sexual \ndeviance. Many times these individuals were not arrested, but their sexual orientation \nwas made public, which often meant they would lose their job, be ostracized by their \n 139 \nfriends and family, and endure public shame and ridicule. Laws created during the sex \ncrime panics impacted society in a variety of ways. First, the majority of laws denying \ncivil liberties to LGBT individuals were written and approved during this time. \nFurthermore, these laws made it possible for employees, housing providers, and other \nservice providers to legally discriminate against sexual minorities (Katz, 1976).  \nIn many respects, the U.S. legal system continues to advantage heterosexuals and \nlimit the power and status of sexual minorities. For instance, there is still no federal \nantidiscrimination law based on sexual orientation, per the 1996 Defense of Marriage \nAct, same-sex couples who are married cannot receive federal benefits and state are not \nrequired to recognize such unions, and many states ban marriage (and several prohibit \ndomestic partnerships or civil unions) for same-sex couples (Herek, 2011). In terms of \nparenting and adoption, some states prohibit same-sex couples from adopting children \n(e.g., Utah and Mississippi), have laws stating that a gay man or lesbian cannot adopt a \nchild (i.e., Florida), or forbid second-parent adoption (when a same-sex partner can \nlegally form a parental relationship with a partner’s biological or adopted child).  The \naforementioned laws related to marriage and adoption serve to reinforce the notion that \nsame-sex relationships are inferior to heterosexual relationships, and foster the belief \nthat same-sex couples do not deserve recognition in society. Furthermore, provide \njustification for the law status of sexual minorities by routinely affording more \nresources, power, and privileges to heterosexuals (Herek, 2009).  \nHeterosexism and medicine. When those in the fields of psychiatry and \nmedicine began to examine issues related set sexual orientation they were considered \n 140 \nprogressive for viewing sexual orientation as pathology, as it was better to think of \nsomeone as being sick than as a sinner (Herek et al., 2007). It was also during this time \nin the late 1800’s, that modern ideas of heterosexual and homosexual began to appear in \nmedical discussions. Homosexual behavior was determined to be the opposite of \nheterosexual behavior, thereby creating the dichotomy between the two. However, the \nterm homosexual was not considered to be a negative, in fact Karl Maria Benkert, who is \ncredited with creating the term homosexual did so to avoid using the pejorative term \n―pederast‖ (Katz, 1976). It was not until 1880 at the term heterosexual was used to \ndescribe its binary opposite (Katz, 1976). Furthermore, early in the 20th century those in \nmedicine and psychiatry did not agree homosexuality was a mental illness, though Kraft \n– Ebing described it as an illness, others such as Havelock Ellis viewed sexuality as a \nnormal variant of human behavior, such as left-handedness (Herek et al., 2007).  In \naddition, Sigmund Freud (1951) contended homosexuality should not be viewed as a \nsource of shame, a vice, or illness.   \nHowever, between World War I and World War II, psychoanalysis rejected \nFreud’s assertions regarding homosexuality and held to the believe that homosexuality \nwas a pathological departure from heterosexuality. Once this view was widely accepted, \nhomosexuality was considered a sociopathic personality disturbance in the first edition \nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health Disorders (Katz, 1976). \nConsidering homosexuality was pathology, steps were taken to prevent the \nillness and cure it once to had been diagnosed. As a result, a number of LGBT people \nunderwent psychotherapy to change their sexual or indication. If psychotherapy proved \n 141 \nunsuccessful, many turned to more drastic measures including hypnosis, hormone \ntreatment, electroshock therapy, administration of nausea-inducing drugs, lobotomy, or \ncastration (Katz, 1976). \nIn the late 1950s, researchers began to challenge the assumption that \nhomosexuality was an illness. Of particular importance was the work of Evelyn Hooker \n(Herek et al., 2007). Her study was significant for several reasons. First, she rejected the \nassumption that sexual minorities and heterosexuals significantly differed in their \npsychological adjustment. Second, her LGBT participants were functioning normally in \nsociety—they were not psychiatric patients. Finally, she allowed random experts—with \nno interest in study and no knowledge of the participants’ sexual orientation—to \nevaluate with the participants psychological adjustment. Results showed no discernable \ndifference between heterosexuals and sexual minorities. Thus, Hooker concluded \nhomosexuality is not inherently related to psychopathology. Her findings were replicated \nin several other studies by different researchers among gay and lesbian populations. \nGiven this overwhelming empirical evidence, in 1973, the Board of Directors for the \nABA voted to remove homosexuality from their diagnostic handbook, and in 1974 a \nvote by the entire membership supported their decision. Since then, the APA has shown \ntremendous support with sexual minorities, and in 2011 a unanimous vote by its \nmembership expressed support of same-sex marriage.  \nAs outlined above, sexual stigma will manifest at the societal level in the form of \nheterosexism; but there are also distinct manifestations of sexual stigma at the individual \nlevel. These manifestations appear when individual behaviors express stigma (enacted \n 142 \nstigma), individuals become cognizant of the stigma and its consequences (felt stigma), \nand when individuals accept or justify the stigma (internalized stigma). Below I will \ndiscuss these manifestations of sexual stigma in greater detail. \nIndividual-Level Sexual Stigma \nEnacted stigma. Enacted stigma refers to when sexual stigma is overtly \nexpressed through a person’s actions. This may include avoidance, physical attacks, and \nderogatory jokes, hiring discrimination or antigay comments. In most instances, enacted \nstigma is directed at sexual minorities. However, friends and family members of these \nindividuals, and people who advocate for LGBT rights may experience stigma by \nassociation—what Goffman (1963) terms a courtesy stigma. Furthermore, because \nLGBT identities are invisible or concealable stigmas, any heterosexual can be \nmistakenly labeled as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume \nanyone has the potential to experience the negative outcomes associated with enacted \nstigma. \nFelt stigma. In contrast to overt forms of sexual stigma, felt stigma describes a \nperson’s expectation or belief that enactments of sexual stigma will occur in various \nsituations. Because sexual minorities are aware of their devalued status in society, they \noftentimes behave in ways that reduce the likelihood of becoming victimized by sexual \nstigma.  For example, sexual minorities may avoid places that are unsupportive of \nLGBT-rights (e.g., Westborough Baptist Church), or use passing techniques to conceal \ntheir sexual orientation (pretend to be attracted to people of the opposite sex). \n 143 \nInternalized stigma. The final individual manifestation of sexual stigma is \ntermed internalized stigma. This refers to an individual’s ―personal acceptance of stigma \nas a part of her or his own value system and self-concept (Herek, 2009, p. 73). When this \nhappens, a person supports or justifies society’s denigration of the stigmatized group. \nInternalized stigma can be experienced by nonstigmatized and stigmatized person; \nhowever, the social and psychological processes associated with this form of sexual \nstigma will differ with respect to which group is examined. For sexual minorities, \ninternalized stigma is termed self-stigma and refers to when these individuals have poor \nself-concepts because they view their sexual desires negatively. This feeling has also \nbeen labeled ―internalized homophobia‖ by some scholars (Weinberg, 1972; Shidlo, \n1994).  \nSexual prejudice. When nonstigmatized individuals hold these attitudes toward \nsame-sex behaviors, it is termed sexual prejudice. Thus, sexual prejudice refers to the \nnegative attitudes held toward an individual based on that person’s sexual orientation \n(Herek, 2009). This type of prejudice is typically negative and characterized by hostility \nor dislike toward people who are (or are perceived to be) LGBT. Sexual prejudice differs \nfrom homophobia, which was coined by George Weinberg in 1960 to describe the fear \nor dread heterosexuals felt toward sexual minorities and the self-hatred persons who \nwere LGBT experienced as a result of their sexual orientation. Although some \nindividuals may fear sexual minorities or homosexual behaviors, sexual prejudice is a \nmore appropriate construct to use when examining attitudes toward individuals who are \nLGBT (Herek, 2009).  \n 144 \nPrevalence of Sexual Prejudice \nThough general attitudes toward sexual minorities are improving, the stigma \nassociated with being LGBT continues to be quite powerful and pervasive across an \narray of social spheres, including schools, organizations, and sport. For instance, sexual \nminorities are twice as likely as their heterosexual counterparts to experience some form \nof prejudice in their lifetime (Meyer, 2003). Typically persons who are LGBT are the \nvictims of disparaging remarks, anti-LGBT epithets, social exclusion, discrimination or \nviolence (Herek, 2009). Furthermore, these expressions of sexual prejudice come from a \nvariety of people, including coworkers, peers, school administrates, teachers, coaches, \nand even the parents of LGBT persons (Anderson, 2002; Herek, 2009; Krane & Barber, \n2005; Ragins, 2008). It can be difficult to find a place of refuge from discrimination, as \nsexual prejudice is deeply engrained into American culture. \nGiven the prevalence of prejudice directed toward sexual minorities, as well as \nthe negative consequences for individuals and organizations, a number of scholarly \ninvestigations focus attention toward understanding this phenomenon. The research \nconducted by Herek (2009) and his colleagues is perhaps the most influential for several \nreasons. First, his work examines how to conceptualize and define prejudiced towards \nsexual minorities. Drawing from stigma theory (Goffman, 1963), Herek (2009) explains \nthat those who are not heterosexual are generally stigmatized in society, such that LGBT \npersons receive fewer valued resources, are afforded less power, and hold a lower social \nstatus when compared to heterosexuals. He terms this sexual sigma and identifies how \n 145 \nthe stigma manifests at both the societal level (i.e., heteosexism) and the individual level \n(i.e, sexual prejudice).  \nAs previously discussed, heterosexism refers to institutionalized sexual stigma. \nThis manifestation of sexual stigma and has been observed in a variety of social \ninstitutions throughout history, and continues to persist today (Herek et al., 2007). As \none illustrative example, consider the impact of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), \nwhich bans the federal recognition of same-sex marriage. When examining the effects of \nthis law, a research group from the Williams Institute estimated there are over 581,300 \nsame-sex couples in the United States, nearly 80,000 are legally married, and an \nadditional 85,000 same-sex couples are in civil unions or registered domestic \npartnerships. However, due to DOMA, these couples are denied Family Medical Leave \nAct (FMLA) benefits, denied benefits for spouses of federal employees, denied veteran \npartner benefits (which negatively impacts over 68,000 veterans), denied equal treatment \nin taxation of employee health benefits, denied equal treatment under spousal \nimpoverishment protection for Medicaid Long Term Care (MLC), denied equal \ntreatment in inheritance tax, denied joint income tax filings, denied equal social security \nsurvivor or spousal benefits, and denied equal treatment for bi-national couples (over \n26,000 couples).  \nPredictors of Sexual Prejudice \nIn addition to heterosexism, sexual prejudice manifests at the individuals level \nand refers to when a person incorporates the negative views associated with the stigma \ninto his or her personal belief system and embrace society’s disparagement of sexual \n 146 \nminorities, thereby perpetuation the status difference that exists among LGBT persons \nand heterosexuals. Within the sexual prejudice literature, scholars have examined a \nnumber of issues; including its antecedents, outcomes, and ways to reduce this form of \nprejudice. These efforts have led to the identification of various demographic, \npsychological, and social variables that relate to sexual prejudice (see Herek, 2009).  \nCollectively, this research suggests individuals with high levels of sexual \nprejudice are more likely to be male, older, less educated, and live in geographic \nlocations where group norm condone sexual prejudice. They are also more likely to hold \nfundamentalist religious believes, and be Republican or politically conservative. Finally, \nthey generally ascribe to traditional gender role beliefs, exhibit authoritarian personality \ntraits, tend to believe homosexual is a choice, and have few friends or family member \nwho are LGBT (cf. Herek, 2009).  \nConsequences of Sexual Prejudice \nMinority Stress  \nAccording to social stress theory, social stressors (e.g. poverty, high crime rate) \nproduce negative effects similar to those created by individual stressors (e.g., career \nending injury, failing a college course), which may lead to physical and mental strain in \na person’s life (Meyer, 1995). Minority stress is an extension of social stress theory, and \nrecognizes that members of stigmatized groups chronically encounter certain stressful \nevents solely because of their devalued social position. Meyer’s (1995; 2003) minority \nstress model provides a framework for understanding the unique stressors minorities \nexperience, the consequences of those stressful events, and coping mechanisms \n 147 \nindividuals use to help assuage minority stress and improve personal wellbeing. When \napplying the model to sexual minorities, Meyer (2003) discussed three stress processes \nthat individuals who are LGBT face. Moving from the most distal to the most proximal, \nthese include (a) the stressful events and activities that affect sexual minorities; (b) the \nexpectations of such events on the part of the LGBT individual, including requisite \naccompanying vigilance; and (c) the sexual minority’s internalization of heterosexism \nand sexual prejudice.  \n With regard to the consequences of minority stress, several trends have emerged \nin regards to the physical and mental health of sexual minorities. First, those who are \nLGBT (or presumed to be) appear to be at greater risk for anxiety or mood disorders \nthan their heterosexual counterparts (Cochran & Mays, 2006), irrespective of gender (see \nHerek & Garnets, 2007). Second, sexual minorities are more likely to display suicidal \ntendencies, especially among adolescences (Russell, 2003). Third, when compared to \nheterosexual women, lesbians tend to consume alcohol in larger quantities, which puts \nthem at a greater risk for alcohol related problems (Cochran, Keenan, Schober, & Mays, \n2000). Finally, experiencing three forms of discrimination (i.e., race, gender, and sexual \norientation), significantly affects mental health outcomes, and can drastically increase a \nperson’s risk of substance abuse (McCabe, et al., 2010).    \n It is worth noting that not all sexual minorities report higher instances of stress, \nand many successfully cope with their minority stress (Herek & Garnets, 2007). \nResearch suggests two possible reasons as to why this occurs. First, if a person views \ntheir sexual orientation identity as part of a collective, they are less likely to experience \n 148 \nstress (Herek & Garnets, 2007). For instance, if people perceive themselves as part of a \ncollective, affiliate with the sexual minority community, and derive enhanced self-\nesteem from membership in this group, they will be better able to cope with stressors \nassociated with their minority status.  \n Second, multiple minority statuses affect how sexual minorities experience \nstress. Although having multiple minority statues does increase one’s likelihood of \nexperiencing stigma or discrimination, according to Herek and Garnets (2007) \n―integrating multiple identities may enhance a minority individual’s overall \npsychological resilience and increase one’s available resources for coping with stigma‖ \n(p. 363). Specifically, recourses (e.g., social support, positive evaluations) individuals \nreceive from other social group affiliations (e.g. African American or Latino \ncommunity) help them manage, and strive in spite of negative situations they encounter \nbecause of their sexual orientation.  Though Herek and Garnets (2007) make a \ncompelling argument, it is still unclear if having a multiple minority status is actually \nadvantageous for the individual. In fact, Szymanski and Gupta (2009) found that racial \nminorities were less equipped to handle the stress associated with sexual prejudice, and \ninternalized heterosexism significantly related to psychological distress and low self-\nesteem among African Americans who are LGBT. The social groups one associates with \nmay help us understand if he or she will have higher or lower levels of stress.  \nIn the sport literature, scholars note that minority stress generally inhibits the \nphysical, psychological, and professional well-being of individuals in sport who are (or \nperceived as being) LGBT (see Anderson, 2005; Sartore & Cunningham, 2010). In terms \n 149 \nof physical consequences, women oftentimes feel pressured to meet heterosexual \nfeminine ideals that permeate the sport culture. In an effort to constantly portray a \nheterosexy image (see Griffin, 1998), women may engage in a host of unhealthy habits, \nsuch as risky sexual behaviors, exercise addiction, substance abuse, or eating disorders \n(Krane, 1997; Krane & Barber, 2005). Furthermore, although most research focuses on \nhow the lesbian stigma impacts women of all sexual orientations, men are also victims of \nsexual prejudice. For instance, Anderson (2005) describes how one of his heterosexual \nplayers was brutally beaten simply because he played for a coach who was openly gay.  \nWith respect to psychological health, Krane’s (1997) qualitative interviews \nrevealed how unsupportive athletic environments contribute to low self-esteem, low \nconfidence, high stress, and substance abuse among lesbian student-athletes. Similarly, \nRotella and Murray’s (1991) results suggest negative psychological conditions among \nathletes who are LGBT are associated with instances of sexual prejudice and \nheterosexism they encounter in their respective sports. Furthermore, Melton and \nCunningham’s (2012) work provides some empirical evidence to supports the notion that \nmultiple marginalized identities can augment these negative experiences. Specifically, \nduring their interviews with lesbian athletes of color, participants discussed how they \nwere unable to fully express their identities in certain contexts. Within the LGBT \ncommunity, they felt as if their racial identity was not always valued, whereas in the \nBlack or Latino community, their perception was that the lesbian identity was \nunacceptable and a source of shame. Participants who shared these views, tended to \n 150 \nexperience social isolation and feelings of guilt and shame because of their identity \n(Melton & Cunningham, 2012). \nPossible moderators. In the sport literature, three factors have been found to \ninfluence one’s level of minority stress. First, Sartore and Cunningham (2010) proposed \nthat the level of stigma consciousness, or ―the degree to which women focus on their \nstereotyped social identify within the sport context‖ (p. 298), can exacerbate or \ncircumvent the negative outcomes associated enactments of sexual prejudice. Thus, \nLGBT person with high levels of stigma consciousness are more likely to anticipate that \nthey will experience negative stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination. Second, these \nauthors also suggest that sport/job type will serve as a moderator. Specifically, women \nwho participate in sports viewed as gender-appropriate (i.e., more feminine sports such \nas figure skating or gymnastics) or who hold low-status positions, will be more likely to \navoid the lesbian stigma than women who participate in sports considered gender-\ninappropriate (i.e., more masculine sports such as football or ice hockey), or who occupy \nhigh status positions (e.g., head coach or athletic director) within sport.  \nFinally, social support may also exaggerate or minimize the possibility that \nsexual minorities will be stigmatized in sport. Social support can provide instrumental, \npsychological, and physical support (Vaux, 1988). Research suggests that minorities \nwho receive support from similar others are less likely to be adversely effected by social \nstigmatization (Meyer, 2003), this is especially true for sexual minorities (Herek and \nGarnets, 2007). Furthermore, LGBT employees who have supportive coworkers \ngenerally report high levels of life satisfaction (Huffman, Watrous-Rodriguez, & King, \n 151 \n2008) and feel more comfortable disclosing their sexual orientation in the workplace \n(Ragins, Singh, & Cornwell, 2007). These dynamics have also been observed among \nathletes and employees in various sport settings (Fink et al., 2012; Melton & \nCunningham, in press-b, 2012).  \nIdentity management techniques. Considering the negative consequences that \ngenerally accompany social stigmatization, many LGBT people adopt identity \nmanagement techniques as a way to evade the stigma and promote a sense of self-worth \nand affirmation in the sport context. Though there are similarities, identity management \nstrategies can differ based on one’s sexual orientation. For gays and lesbians in sport, \nthis usually entails using passing or revealing strategies (Clair, Beatty, & MacLean, \n2005). Passing is the practice of disguising or withholding one’s sexual identity and it \ncan take three forms—fabrication, concealment, or discretion. On the other hand, \nrevealing involves disclosing one’s sexual orientation to others. Individuals who are \nLGBT can reveal their sexual orientation by using signaling, normalizing, or \ndifferentiating techniques. In the sport context, research has consistently shown that \nmost sexual minorities adhere to the norm of silence in sport and subsequently use \nvarious strategies to conceal (rather than reveal) their sexual orientation (Griffin, 1998; \nKrane & Barber, 2005; Sartore & Cunningham, 2009a; 2010).  \nConsidering the lesbian or gay stigma is also used to limit the power and \nopportunities of heterosexuals (Krane, 2001; Sartore & Cunningham, 2009a; 2010), they \ntoo develop a number of coping mechanisms to escape this form of stigmatization. For \ninstance, research suggests, that women, particularly when participating in sports viewed \n 152 \nas more masculine, will engage in ―defensive othering‖—the process in which \nsubordinate group members distance themselves from other subordinates by displaying \nattitudes and behaviors that reinforce and legitimize their devalued status (Ezzell, 2009, \np. 111). Specifically, women will take on the views of dominant group members (i.e., \nemphasizing the notion that men’s sport is superior to women’s sport, support the view \nthat women should not appear too muscular or masculine, or reinforce the belief that \nheterosexuality is and should be the norm) in response to the lesbian stigma and \nbacklash women encounter in sport settings. When relying on this strategy, women cast \nthemselves as the exception to the stereotype, thereby unintentionally reinforcing \nmasculine hegemony and heteronormative ideology in sport. And, while there are \ndifferences among lesbians and heterosexual women in terms of how the manage their \nidentity in the sport context, both groups routinely present themselves as ultra-feminine \n(Krane, 2001), or what Griffin (1998) terms heterosexy, in order to prove their \nheterosexuality.  \nThe gendered nature of sport also influences how men express their sexuality and \nmasculinity. Specifically, traditional views of gender, gender roles, and sexuality are \nused as organizing principles to reinforce male superiority, female subordination, and \nnorms of heterosexuality (Krane, 2001). As such, research continually characterizes \nsport as a site that produces and perpetuates masculine and heterosexual dominance \n(Messner, 2002). Within this gendered setting, White, Protestant, able-bodied, \nheterosexual males are considered to embody the characteristics of a prototypical sport \nemployee or participant, and are subsequently afforded greater power, privilege, and \n 153 \nstatus than those who do not resemble this prototype (Fink, Pastore, & Reimer, 2001). \nMen will perform hyper-masculine traits in order to improve their status in sport; \nwhereas, women, seen as trespassers in this masculine domain, must perform hyper-\nfeminine behaviors as a way to gain limited acceptance from dominant group members \n(i.e., prototypical sport employees and participants). Furthermore, the norms of \nmasculinity and femininity are coupled with the assumption of compulsory \nheterosexuality (i.e., all individuals are or should be heterosexual; Rich, 1980). Those \nwho deviate from any of these expected forms of behavior are likely to face \ndiscrimination and stigmatization. According Messner (2002), it is virtually impossible \nto be a gay male in sport. To do so would contradict the deeply ingrained belief that men \nwho participate in sport are hyper-masculine, heterosexuals.  Therefore, men must \nadhere to these gendered guidelines and prove their heterosexuality, to reduce the \nnegative effects of minority stress and avoid losing status and power within the sporting \nworld.  \nOrganizational or team performance. Manifestations of minority stress at the \nindividual-level (depression, low self-esteem, low job satisfaction) can also significantly \ninfluence group, team, or organizational outcomes. For instance, research suggests \nemployees who report high level of work related stress are more likely to experience \npoor physical and psychological well-being, with limits their performance and/or \nproduction at work (Cryer, McCraty, & Childre, 2003).  However, when diverse \nemployees feel valued and included in the workplace, they are more likely to experience \nhigh job satisfaction, which relates to positive organizational outcomes (Milliken & \n 154 \nMartins, 1996). Some evidence in the sport literature provides support for this argument. \nFor instance, Cunningham (2011b) examined performance outcomes related to sexual \norientation diversity in NCAA Division I athletic programs. In his study, athletic \ndepartments that combined high sexual orientation diversity with a proactive diversity \nstrategy (i.e., a strategy that values diversity and emphasizes inclusion and positively \nrelates to job satisfaction among minorities) were able to significantly outperform other \nprograms—in some instances, these programs earned almost seven times the NACDA \npoints of their peers. In a follow-up study with athletic departments from all NCAA \ndivisions (2011a), findings indicated high sexual orientation diversity positively related \nto a creative work environment when the organization had a strong commitment to \ndiversity. Of particular interest, the least creative work environments were characterized \nby high sexual orientation diversity and low commitment to diversity. \nSexual Orientation at Work \nThough heterosexuals’ attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \n(LGBT) individuals have improved over time (Herek, 2009), sexual prejudice is still \npervasive. This is particularly the case within workplace settings. There are no federal \nlaws prohibiting workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity, and although some states and municipalities have passed such mandates, they \nare in the minority (Human Rights Campaign, 2012). Perhaps not surprising given the \nlack of legal protection, Ragins et al. (2007) report that nearly 40 percent of LGBT \nemployees tell of facing some form of hostility or harassment while at work; \nfurthermore, almost 1 of 10 sexual minority employees indicate that they have been \n 155 \ndismissed unfairly or pressured to voluntarily resign from their position because of their \nsexual orientation or gender identity. Experimental studies also show that LGBT job \napplicants face access discrimination when seeking employment (Cunningham et al., \n2010; Hebl et al., 2002).  \nThe psychological and physical tolls of facing workplace discrimination are \nconsiderable. Sexual prejudice serves as a social stressor and can negatively impact \none’s psychological and physical well-being (Meyer, 2003; see also Herek et al., 2009). \nIndeed, researchers have shown that, because of the differential treatment they \nexperience, LGBT employees are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to \nreport decreased job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and overall career success \n(Ragins, 2008; Ragins & Cornwell, 2001).  \nGiven the negative effects of sexual prejudice on LGBT employees, some \norganizations have made concerted efforts to improve the organizational diversity \nclimate. This is achieved in several ways, such as having inclusive workplace policies, \nimplementing anti-discrimination policies, and providing a supportive workplace \nenvironment (see Button, 2001; Cunningham, 2011; Huffman et al., 2008). A number of \ntheoreticians have convincingly argued for the benefits of inclusive workplaces, as such \nsettings should benefit sexual minorities, work teams, and the organization as a whole \n(Ely & Thomas, 2001; Shore et al., 2011). In one of the few studies to empirically test \nsuch propositions, Cunningham (2011b) observed that organizations that had high sexual \norientation diversity within an inclusive workplace culture far outperformed their peers \non objective measures of performance (see also Cunningham, 2011a).  \n 156 \nForms of Support  \n Organizational support. According to social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), \nindividuals generally assume their relationships will be reciprocal.  As such, when \nemployees feel their contributions enhance the wellbeing of the organization, they may \nbelieve the organization should support their personal wellbeing.  Formal policies and \npractices that promote or protect LGBT-rights can symbolize inclusiveness for LGBT \nemployees (Huffman et al., 2008; King & Cortina, 2010). Furthermore, previous \nresearch suggests providing this form of support can produce a number of benefits. \nSpecifically, empirical evidence suggests organizations support strongly relates to \ndisclosure among sexual minorities (Huffman et al., 2008; Griffith & Hebl, 2002), which \nis beneficial for a number of reasons. First, from an organizational standpoint, out \nemployees tend to report higher levels of job satisfaction (Day & Schoenrade, 1997) and \njob commitment (Day & Schoenrad, 1997; 2000). In addition, being open in the \nworkplace is generally associated with improved health and wellbeing (Van Den Bergh, \n1999; Ragins, 2008).  Thus, organizations should establish formal inclusive polices to \nensure their diverse employees feel fully supported and accepted by the organization.    \n Supervisor support. Supervisor support is a more proximal source of \norganizational support that can influence perceptions of inclusiveness in an organization \n(Huffman et al., 2008). Within the management literature, supervisors are considered a \nform of organizational support, and not social support, because they (a) hold power over \nthe employee who is receiving the support, (c) and their actions generally act in \naccordance with organizational policy or values.  \n 157 \n Social support from coworkers. Having social support in the workplace can \npositively relate to work and personal outcomes for employees who are LGBT \n(Huffman, Watrous, & King, 2008). Past researchers have emphasized organizational \nsupport and specific policies an organization can implement (i.e., non-discrimination \npolicy, domestic-partner benefits) to demonstrate LGBT inclusiveness (see Ragins, \n2004). However, support can also emanate from informal relationships with supervisors \nor coworkers. Supportive coworkers create a safe place at work for employees—a place \nwhere workers feel their identity is affirmed and accepted. Moreover, coworkers, who \nare also close friends, can be a source of tremendous support during the coming out \nprocess (Ragins, 2008).  \n Research contends the need for interpersonal affiliation is essential for physical \nand psychological wellbeing across the life span, including life at work (Cacioppo, \n2008). Thus, social support in the workplace can be particular beneficial for sexual \nminorities, similar to the safe havens Ragins (2004) has discussed. Specifically, the \ncoworker support can create a work environment where the employees feel they belong \nand are valued for their uniqueness (Avery, 2011).   \n Ally support. Martinez and Hebl’s (2010) authors argue that social norms may \ndictate the type of culture and climate within an organization. The actions and directives \nfrom allies can make it clear that prejudice and discrimination will not be tolerated in the \nworkplace.  Empirical evidence also supports the contention the individuals can be \neffectively influence the inclusive beliefs of others. Most notable, Zitek and Hebl (2007) \n 158 \nobserved that individuals were more likely to hold positive attitudes towards gay men \nwhen they had witnessed someone model such attitudes.   \nFurthermore, while formal policies and strategic goals are important, employees \nwho champion diversity represent key elements of an inclusive workplace (Avery, \n2011). Illustrative of these effects, Huffman et al. (2008) found that as support for sexual \nminority employees increased, so too did the quality of LGBT employees’ work \noutcomes. Heterosexuals are particularly important in this process (Brooks & Edwards, \n2009; Martinez & Hebl, 2010). As persons who are not stigmatized (Ragins, 2008), \nheterosexual employees enjoy power and privilege in the workplace and therefore have \nthe social capital needed to support and advocate for LGBT equality. They do so by \nproviding inclusiveness, safety, and equity (Brooks & Edwards, 2009) and they can \npotentially shape the attitudes of other employees (Zitek & Hebl, 2007). Thus, \nemployees who support LGBT equality in the workplace, or allies, put inclusive policies \nand mandates into action.                          \nAlly Motivations \nScholars who investigate heterosexual advocacy for LGBT rights approach the \nissue in a variety of ways. One approach draws from literature examining the process \nmajority group members go through when developing an awareness of the power and \nstatus they hold in society. Within this stream of inquiry, Bieschke (2002) suggests \ndeveloping one’s heterosexual identity involves ―a complex counter-discourse‖ (p.576) \nin which an individual begins to question deeply ingrained, taken-for-granted \nassumptions that foster heterosexual dominance in society. As one continues to examine \n 159 \nwhat it means to be heterosexual in modern societies, he or she should develop a greater \nunderstanding of people who are LGBT. Thus, a person’s increased awareness of \nheterosexual privilege motivates him or her to display behaviors that support LGBT \npeople and causes (for similar arguments see Mohr, 2002).  \nWorthington and his colleagues (Worthington et al., 2002; Worthington et al., \n2005) also emphasize the importance of self-reflection, but did not draw exclusively \nfrom the heterosexual identity development literature. Rather, their interviews with \nfuture counselors showed allies increased their activism once they thoughtfully reflected \non (a) how they were initially taught to regard same-sex behaviors, (b) their own \naversion to being labeled gay or lesbian, and (c) their realization of heterosexual \nprivilege in society.   \nAdditional work that focuses on heterosexual ally motivations explores various \nfactors related to attitudes and behaviors that support LGBT equality. Much of this work \nis qualitative in nature and seeks to understand what experiences encourage heterosexual \nto become allies. For instance, Vela-McConnell’s (1999) interviews revealed some \nparticipants learned of LGBT concerns through their activism with other civil rights \nissues. Other allies, as they began to gain a greater understanding of LGBT issues \nthrough initial volunteer efforts, began to increase their activism and developed a deep \nsense of personal responsibility. In addition, a significant amount of research also \nsuggests contact with sexual minorities can encourage people to be allies. For instance, \nVernaglia’s (1999) work examines parents become active in organizations (i.e., PFLAG; \nParents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) aimed at increasing acceptance and \n 160 \nequality for individuals who are LGBT as a way to demonstrate their love and \nacceptance for the lesbian or gay child.  \nFinally, Russell (2011) conducted extensive interviews with over 100 allies and \ndetermined ally motivations are either based on personal experiences or one’s \nfundamental principles. With respect to the later, motives may stem from a commitment \nto justice, civil rights, patriotism, religious beliefs, or moral principles. However, allies \nare motivated by personal experiences when they advocate because of their professional \nrole or they have an LGBT friend or family member.  \nConclusions \nIn conclusion, the purpose of this chapter was to provide a brief overview of the \nsexual orientation literature and propose avenues of future research regarding LGBT \ninclusion in sport organizations.  In doing so, I first defined key terms and provided a \nhistorical overview of how sexual orientation has been conceptualized in modern \nsocieties. Then, I expand on concepts such as sexual stigma and sexual prejudice, \nincluding a definition of the terms and their antecedents and outcomes. The discussion \nthen focuses on issues related to sexual orientation in the workplace. From there, I forms \nof support for LGBT, such as supervisor support, coworker support, and ally support.  \nThis review highlighted gaps in the literature and focused attention on issues that \nwarrant further research.  \nSpecifically, the foregoing discussion suggests four key points: (a) employee \nsupport, and particularly heterosexual allies, play a vital role in creating an inclusive \nworkplace for LGBT employees; (b) even if employees have positive attitudes toward \n 161 \nLGBT inclusiveness, they still face a number of obstacles to engaging in championing \nbehaviors; and (c) most work in this area has focused primarily on predictors of sexual \nprejudice rather than positive attitudes toward sexual minorities (d) understanding what \nindividual and situational factors lead to ally support in the workplace can help increase \nchampioning behaviors. Thus, the purpose of and rationale for this dissertation research \nis to examine antecedents and outcomes of ally support in the work context.\n  \n1\n6\n2 \n \nAPPENDIX B \n \nFIGURES AND TABLES \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 1:  A Conceptual Model for Understanding Employee Support for LGBT Inclusion in Sport Organizations \n  \n1\n6\n3 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: A Multilevel Model for Explaining Ally Support in Sport Organizations \n \n  \n1\n6\n4 \n \n \n \nFigure 3:  Illustrative Summary of Study 3 Predictions \n \n  \n1\n6\n5 \n \n \nFigure 4:  Illustrative Summary of Hypothesized Model in Study 3 \n  \n1\n6\n6 \n \n \nTable 1 \n                \n                 \nMeans, Standard Deviations, and Bivariate Correlations \n            \nItem \nM SD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \n1.

    "abstract": "Employee support is a key factor in creating more welcoming and accepting work environments for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in sport. As such, organizations need to understand what factors encourage employees to display attitudes and behaviors that support inclusion. Thus, the purpose of my dissertation was to advance the literature by examining antecedents and outcomes related to employee support for LGBT inclusion and equality in the workplace.\n\nIn Study 1, I provide LGBT employees the opportunity to share their perceptions of support for LGBT inclusion, particularly how the attitudes and behaviors of their coworkers foster or inhibit acceptance in the workplace. Results indicate that various micro-level (demographics, personality, experiences with LGBT individuals) and meso-level factors (organizational culture for diversity, support of relevant others) influenced the level of employee support for LGBT inclusive policies. Furthermore, power meaningfully influenced these dynamics, such that individuals in low status positions within the athletic department were hesitant to show support for LGBT equality. However, those who did champion LGBT inclusive initiatives successfully modeled supportive behaviors and positive attitudes toward LGBT individuals, vocally opposed discriminatory treatment, and provided sexual minorities with a safe space at work.\n\nIn Study 2, I develop a multilevel model that addresses factors at the macro-level (i.e., mass media, inclusive community), meso-level (i.e., sexual orientation diversity, presence of other allies), and micro-level (i.e., personality, personal values, attitudes toward LGBT individuals, contact with LGBT individuals) that influence ally support. In addition, I differentiate between attitudinal and behavioral support for LGBT equality, and discuss various factors that may encourage allies to engage in more active ally behaviors. \n\nIn Study 3, I drew from the multilevel model to examine how micro-, meso-, and macro-level factors influence attitudinal support for sexual LGBT inclusion among sport employees, and determine if these attitudes affect behavioral support for LGBT inclusion in the workplace. The results from the study offered support that multilevel factors relate to support for LGBT inclusion. Specifically, sex, supervisor support, and typed of media consumed were related to attitudinal support for LGBT inclusion, and these attitudes positively associated with championing behaviors",
