to demand policychange in all of its member states+Our claims about the erga omnes effect are broadly consistent with a growingliterature that attributes the influence of international law to domestic complianceconstituencies that operate in specific political and institutional contexts+8 Yet, ouranalysis goes beyond compliance to investigate whether ICs, like well-functioningdomestic courts, influence the behavior of actors throughout a legal system+9 Wealso examine the effects of lawmaking by international judges rather than by statesvia the negotiation and ratification of treaties+ There is a growing literature on IClawmaking,10 but it has not considered the relationship to IC effectiveness+ More-over, because international judicial lawmaking does not involve commitments thatstates expressly accept, the theoretical mechanisms through which ICs gain domes-tic traction for their decisions are different than those for treaty commitments+We evaluate our theory by analyzing ECtHR judgments on LGBT rights issues+The ECtHR has become increasingly progressive on LGBT issues+ It has foundviolations of the European Convention against countries that criminalize consen-sual same-sex conduct, that impose a higher age of consent for gay men, thatprohibit lesbians and gay men from serving in the military, and that restrict trans-sexuals’ ability to change identity documents or to marry+ For each of these issues,the court reversed one or more earlier decisions rejecting challenges to these pol-icies+ This pattern suggests a high degree of judicial discretion or agency+11 Yetthese shifts in ECtHR jurisprudence also track similar progressive trends in thenational laws and policies of CoE member states+ We thus examine whether ECtHRrulings themselves increase the likelihood of policy reforms in CoE countries, orwhether the court merely follows preexisting legal and social trends+8+ See, for example, Alter and Helfer 2010; Burley and Mattli 1993; Cichowski 2007; Dai 2005;Guzman 2008; Hawkins and Jacoby 2010; Hillebrecht 2012; Huneeus 2011; Keller and Stone Sweet2008; Kelley 2004; and Simmons 2009+9+ For recent contributions questioning the focus on state compliance, see Howse and Teitel 2010;and Martin 2012+On the parallels between international and domestic courts, see Staton and Moore 2011+10+ See, for example, Ginsburg 2005; and Steinberg 2004+11+ See Burley and Mattli 1993; and Alter and Meunier-Aitsahalia 1994+International Courts as Agents of Legal Change 3We create a data set that identifies whether and when the policies of the forty-seven CoE member states follow ECtHR jurisprudence on five LGBT legal issues+The data set includes LGBT issues unaffected by ECtHR litigation to control forthe confounding effect of other trends that increase LGBT rights protections+ Wefind that an ECtHR judgment against one nation increases the likelihood that allCoE countries will adopt the same pro-LGBT policy+ The annual probability thata state changes its policy is about fourteen percentage points higher when there isan ECtHR judgment+ These findings are partially explained by CoE and EuropeanUnion ~EU! demands that nations seeking to join these IOs comply with someECtHR rulings on LGBT issues+ However, we also find that ECtHR judgmentsincrease the likelihood of policy reforms for issues and countries not subject tomembership conditionality+Most notably, ECtHR rulings have the greatest marginal effect in countries wherepublic acceptance of homosexuals is low+ This finding is contrary to a prevailingcritique of human rights treaties and of international laws and institutions moregenerally—that they matter most where they are needed least+12 We find that theeffect of ECtHR judgments on low-support countries is greatest where nationalcourts can invoke the European Convention when reviewing domestic laws or wherethe executive is not supported by a religious, nationalistic, or rural party+ Thus,the combination of an ECtHR ruling against another country with favorable domes-tic political or institutional conditions helps to overcome low public support forLGBT rights and increases the likelihood of policy change+ This is consistent withthe idea that the ECtHR follows a strategy of “majoritarian activism,” using thelaws and policies of most member countries as a benchmark for developing inter-national standards+13The Erga Omnes Effect of IC JudgmentsICs do not have the direct authority to implement their decisions, but they caninfluence the actors that do, such as domestic courts, executives, and IOs+ Forexample, the behavior of executive branch officials may be constrained by interestgroups that hold them accountable for implementing treaty obligations,14 or becausethey fear damaging their reputation for compliance with international law vis-à-vis other states+15 Other studies highlight the alliances that ICs forge with nationaljudges or administrators whose interests are furthered by compliance with inter-12+ See, for example, Downs and Jones 2002; Downs, Rocke, and Barsoom 1996; and Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui 2007+13+ Maduro 1998, 11+14+ For example, Simmons 2009+15+ See, for example, Guzman 2008; and Brewster 2009+4 International Organizationnational rulings or who are persuaded to do so by an IC’s interpretation of thelaw+16These insights do not, however, directly translate to the analysis of erga omneseffects because no legally binding commitments are at stake+ To voters, interestgroups, or other states that care about compliance with international law, execu-tives can respond that the government has no obligation to follow IC judgmentsagainst other nations+ In the absence of a formal compliance obligation, domesticcourts and administrators are not forced into action and may even have incentivesfor inaction to avoid charges of overreaching+Nevertheless, we argue that there are three mechanisms by which judgmentscan influence compliance constituencies in states not a party to IC proceedings—the threat of future litigation, the persuasive authority of judicial reasoning, andthe agenda-setting effect of IC decisions+ As we detail later, a number of domesticand international conditions make it more or less likely that these mechanisms,either individually or in combination, have sufficient force to overcome domesticopposition to IC-inspired policy reforms+Three Mechanisms of IC Influence on NonpartiesPreempting future IC litigation. Although ICs lack a formal stare decisis prin-ciple, they generally follow their own rulings+17 Repeat litigation of the same legalissue generally leads to the same outcome even if it involves a different state+Anticipating this result, national governments or courts may change their behav-ior to preempt future IC review+ For example, Canada abandoned its “zeroing”dumping policy with explicit reference to earlier WTO decisions against the EUand the United States;18 high courts in Argentina and Colombia struck downamnesty laws based on judgments of the Inter-American Court of Human Rightsinvalidating amnesties in Peru;19 and the German Federal Constitutional Courtdeferred to the International Court of Justice ~ICJ’s! interpretation of a treaty thatGermany had ratified, although the country was not a party to the case+20 Theprospect of an IC ruling may also empower IOs to demand policy change+ As wedetail later, the EU Commission relied heavily on ECtHR rulings to identify thehuman rights conditions for EU membership, partially because it asserted that theECtHR would invalidate restrictive laws in candidate countries+21Persuasive authority. An IC’s reasoned determination that a law or policy isillegal can influence the behavior of compliance constituencies in other jurisdic-16+ See, for example, Alter 2009; Helfer, Alter, and Guerzovich 2009; and Burley and Mattli 1993+17+ See, for example, Busch 2007; Shahabuddeen 2007; and Wildhaber 2000+18+ Kanargelidis 2005+19+ Binder 2011+20+ Gärditz 2007+21+ Kochenov 2007+International Courts as Agents of Legal Change 5tions with similar laws or policies+ For example, the legal analysis adopted by ICjudges may help build alliances between international and national judges that per-suade national judges to strike down treaty-inconsistent domestic policies+22 Thatthis mechanism of influence is divorced from the threat of future international lit-igation is suggested by the citation of IC judgments in countries beyond the court’sauthority+ For example, ECtHR judgments on LGBT rights have been favorablycited by courts as far away as Hong Kong, India, South Africa, and the UnitedStates+23 Persuasive authority need not be tied to legal reasoning: citizens and elitescan be swayed by the fact that a policy is illegal if that information comes from animpartial source perceived to have expertise+ Survey experiments have also foundthat both elites and publics are more likely to oppose policies when they areinformed that these policies violate international law, even if no issue of noncom-pliance is raised+24Agenda setting. An IC judgment may raise awareness and thus increase thelikelihood that an issue will appear on the agenda of national parliaments or exec-utives+ Simmons makes this argument with respect to treaties:It is one thing not to initiate policy change on the national level and quiteanother not to respond once a particular right is made salient through inter-national negotiations+ Silence is ambiguous in the absence of a particular pro-posal, but it can easily be interpreted as opposition in the presence of a specificaccord+25The concrete and fact-specific context of IC rulings can increase political saliencein a similar fashion+ For example, following an ECtHR ruling against the UnitedKingdom ~UK’s! blanket ban on prisoner voting, the Irish Parliament quicklyadopted legislation to allow prisoners to vote by mail+ The issue had not previ-ously been on the agenda; lawmakers indicated that the reform was motivated bythe ECtHR’s judgment even as they stressed that Irish suffrage laws would havesurvived a challenge in Strasbourg+26 Similarly, civil society groups, judges, andsupportive legislators capitalized on the attention generated by the Inter-AmericanCourt’s jurisprudence on amnesty laws to pursue bolder human rights policies inLatin America+27These three mechanisms may work separately or in tandem+ For example, evenif an IC’s reasoning fails to persuade interest groups, national judges may revisittheir case law to preempt future international litigation+28 Similarly, lawmakers22+ Slaughter 1994 and 2003+23+ Khosla 2011+24+ Tomz 2008+25+ Simmons 2009, 128 ~emphasis in original!+26+ Behan and O’Donnell 2008+27+ Binder 2011+28+ Kumm and Comella 2005+6 International Organizationsympathetic to reforms may have refrained from acting until an IC catapults theissue to the top of the legislative agenda+Even when these mechanisms operate together, however, there is no guaranteethat IC rulings will influence state behavior+ In some countries, for example, theinfluence of compliance constituencies may be too weak to overcome local resis-tance to change+ Three conditions should make it more likely that the three mech-anisms of IC influence causally contribute to policy change+We use these conditionsto develop more precise hypotheses about the operation of the erga omnes effect+First, the erga omnes effect is more likely when national courts can review alle-gations that domestic policies violate international law and when treaties are deeplyembedded in national legal systems+29 If treaties have a status equal or superior todomestic constitutions or statutes, national judges should be more likely to deferto IC interpretations of those instruments+ For example, the Constitutional Courtof Croatia accepts the “binding interpretive authority” of all ECtHR judgmentsdue to the “quasi-constitutional status of the Convention in the Croatian legalorder+”30 In contrast, if national courts cannot invoke international law to reviewdomestic policies, then judges’ aversion to being reviewed internationally and thepersuasive power of IC interpretations should have a less pronounced influence onpolicy change+Even in countries whose courts have strong review powers, domestic actors mayprefer to effect policy change through the legislature+ Yet, if such change isunlikely—for example because it is politically unpopular—litigants may turn tonational courts, citing IC decisions in an attempt to persuade judges to align domes-tic policies with international standards+ This suggests that the marginal effect ofIC decisions is greatest where domestic political support for policy change is lowbut domestic legal institutions are receptive to the influence of international law+Second, the erga omnes effect may depend on the government in power whenan IC issues its judgment+ An IC decision provides a signal about the legality of apolicy in force in multiple countries+31 Such a signal may tip the balance in favorof reform if voters care about adherence to international law but were unaware oruncertain that the policy violates its dictates+ On the other hand, voters with strongpredispositions are not easily persuaded by new information+32 For example, in con-trast to Ireland, where prisoner voting reform sailed through parliament, the issuebecame hugely controversial in the UK+ In opinion polls taken following the judg-ment, 80 percent of British Conservatives, the main party in government, opposedgiving prisoners the right to vote+33 While the IC ruling had an agenda-setting effectand the parliament voted on it, the proposal was rejected in the face of thisopposition+29+ Helfer 2008+30+ Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights 2010, 17+31+ Dai 2005+32+ For example, Zaller 1992+33+ YouGov 2011+ The marginals for Labor and the Liberals were between 40 and 50 percent+International Courts as Agents of Legal Change 7We expect IC rulings to have the largest impact where the government in poweris at least not actively opposed to reform+ This is not a circular argument+ Forexample, religious parties tend to be much more strongly opposed to LGBT rightsthan are liberal or left-wing parties+ Yet, liberal or left parties do not always pushfor LGBT legal reforms, especially in countries where public acceptance is low+ Ifthese parties are in power, the increased issue salience and declaration of illegal-ity that results from an IC ruling may tip the balance in favor of reforms+ We thusexpect the marginal effect of such rulings to be strongest in countries that areotherwise unlikely to adopt reforms, for example, because of low public support,but where the composition of the government is relatively favorable to policychange+ In such circumstances, governments can point to IC judgments to justifytheir actions as consistent with international law+Third, we expect the erga omnes effect to be larger when IOs can leverage ICjudgments+ Such influence is strongest when IOs impose conditions on member-ship+34 IOs often seek to justify such conditions, however, and IC rulings mayserve that purpose+ For example, an IO can motivate policy change by arguingthat in future litigation an IC would find a country in breach of international law+Judicial interpretations may also persuade IO officials that a policy is illegal andthus incompatible with membership+ As we illustrate with LGBT rights, this maylead the organization to demand reforms of policies that an IC has adjudicated butnot for similar policies that it has not ~or not yet! reviewed+The ECtHR and LGBT Rights in EuropeAn empirical investigation of the erga omnes effect is highly demanding+ It requiresanalyzing the legal principles in IC judgments and coding whether the policies inall states subject to a court’s jurisdiction adhere to those principles in multipleyears+ To overcome these challenges, our study chooses depth over breadth+ Welimit our analysis to a single court—the ECtHR35—and a single issue area—LGBT rights+ Within these constraints, however, we focus on multiple judgmentsand several subissues+Case SelectionWe selected the ECtHR for several reasons+ It is the most active IC and it exer-cises authority over forty-seven countries that vary in the domestic institutions of34+ For example, Kelley 2004+35+ For more on the European human rights system, see White and Ovey 2010+ Our study includesLFBT rights decisions of the European Commission on Human Rights+ Prior to a reform of the con-vention in 1998, the European Commission reviewed individual applications and issued reasoned deci-sions determining whether a state had violated the convention+ The commission or the defending statecould appeal these decisions to the ECtHR+8 International Organizationtheoretical interest+ In addition, although the ECtHR asserts that its judgments haveerga omnes effects, the extent to which its decisions actually influence govern-ment policies is uncertain+We chose LGBT rights on a number of grounds+ Challenges to restrictions onthose rights in Strasbourg have occurred for more than half a century+Yet the court’sresponse to these challenges has evolved markedly over time, highlighting theagency of ECtHR judges+ LGBT rights also feature prominently in legal and socialscience debates about court-led social change and political backlashes againstjudges+36This last issue is especially noteworthy+ The development of ECtHR case lawhas been influenced by progressive shifts in European laws and social policiesregarding sexual minorities+ Yet these changes are by no means universal+ Somegovernments and publics remain skeptical of or openly hostile to LGBT rights+ A2007 Gallup Poll survey of acceptance of gays and lesbians in 117 countries rankedCoE member states at the top ~The Netherlands, with 83 percent acceptance! andthe bottom ~Azerbaijan, with 2 percent acceptance! with other countries spreadout along a continuum+37 Moreover, several Eastern European nations are now con-sidering proposals to recriminalize homosexual conduct or outlaw favorable pub-lic portrayals of gay men and lesbians+38 These divergent attitudes provide variationto examine the erga omnes effect on states whose policies have not ~or not yet!been challenged in Strasbourg, including countries actively opposed to reformsthat the ECtHR has endorsed+These two attributes—judicial recognition of progressive legal and social trendstogether with resistance by some governments—characterize many European humanrights cases+ Prisoner voting is a prominent recent example+ But there are manyother instances in which the ECtHR has expanded human rights “to ensure thatthe interpretation of the Convention reflects societal changes and remains in linewith present-day conditions+”39 Combating discrimination against Roma commu-nities, blocking deportations of suspected terrorists, and bolstering the due pro-cess rights of criminal defendants are other examples where the court has foundfault with countries whose policies are less progressive than those of their neigh-bors, sometimes generating negative responses from governments+The Evolution of Strasbourg Case Law and National Policieson LGBT RightsTable 1 illustrates the evolution of Strasbourg case law for several lesbian and gaylegal issues+ Table 2 reveals a

United Kingdom, for example, the court stated that itcould “not overlook” the decriminalization and “increased tolerance of homosex-ual behavior + + + in the great majority of the member-states of the Council ofEurope+”44 Aware of the importance that the ECtHR attaches to European consen-sus, advocacy groups often submit amicus briefs that document legal and socialtrends+ This is illustrated by Goodwin v.

First, ECtHR rulings against one nation can influence policychanges across Europe via judicial review+ For example, when the Hungarian ~2002!and the Portuguese Constitutional Courts ~2005! declared unconstitutional theunequal age-of-consent laws in those countries, they relied heavily on the Suther-land decision finding that the UK’s age-of-consent statute contravened the Euro-pean Convention+46 In 2007, the Irish Supreme Court overturned national lawsthat prohibited changing a birth certificate following sex reassignment, relying onthe ECtHR’s decision in Goodwin v. United Kingdom+47The cases from Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal also suggest a more nuancedpoint—that ECtHR judgments may be especially influential where public accep-tance of LGBT individuals is relatively low but where domestic courts can rely onECtHR precedents when reviewing national policies+ In the 1999 European Val-ues Study, for example, Hungary ranked last among thirty-five CoE countries inpublic acceptance of homosexuals+ The same study identifies Portugal and Irelandas in general the least tolerant nations in Western Europe+48 Yet in Hungary ~since1993!, Ireland ~since 2004!, and Portugal ~since 1978!, domestic courts can reviewlegislation based on its compatibility with the European Convention+49 This leadsus to hypothesize that ECtHR judgments increase the probability of policy changein countries where public support for such change is low and where domestic courtscan rely on the convention and Strasbourg case law when exercising judicial review+Legislative change. The most important factor facilitating legislative change isthe partisan composition of governments+ The literature suggests that oppositionto LGBT rights is greatest among religious, rural, and nationalist voters+50 Govern-ments composed of parties supported by these voters should be less susceptible tothe agenda-setting effect of ECtHR judgments favoring LGBT rights+ Conversely,the marginal effect of judgments should be greatest in countries where public accep-tance of LGBT individuals is relatively low but where the executive is not from aparty that relies on rural, religious, or nationalist constituencies+A telling illustration is the 1999 Lustig-Prean judgment against the UK for ban-ning gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military+ LGBT activistsand progressive political parties argued that similar bans in other CoE countriesviolated the European Convention+ In Germany,Winfried Stecher, a lieutenant dis-missed after admitting his homosexuality at a public hearing, filed a court chal-46+ Waaldijk 2001+47+ Foy -v- An t-Ard Chláraitheoir & Ors, IEHC 470 ~2007!+48+ European Values Study 2011+49+ Based on our own coding+50+ See, for example, Adamczyk and Pitt 2009; Inglehart and Baker 2000; and Lax and Philips2009+International Courts as Agents of Legal Change 13lenge to that country’s “glass ceiling” policy that denied officer positions to gaymen and lesbians+51 Defense Minister and Social Democrat ~SPD!

Decriminalization and age-of-consent policies16 International OrganizationThe visual evidence in Figure 1 indicates that when the Sutherland case wasdecided in 1996, only about half of the CoE’s member states had adopted an equalage of consent+ This reveals that the European consensus that the ECtHR oftencites as a justification for finding a violation of the convention need not be a super-majority of states+ It also illustrates that Strasbourg jurists have considerable dis-cretion to decide when to recognize evolving regional trends+Figure 1 also provides some support for the Sutherland decision as the triggerfor an erga omnes effect for equal age-of-consent laws, although the adoption ofsuch laws predated the decision+ The impact of the Dudgeon case is more difficultto evaluate, given that most CoE member states had decriminalized by the timethe judgment was issued+ Nevertheless, Dudgeon could have had an influencethrough the mechanism of conditionality+ The overall pattern in decriminalizationin the 1990s closely tracks patterns in CoE membership and is consistent with thehypothesis that countries adopted laws one or two years before they joined theorganization+ Conditionality did not apply to unequal age-of-consent laws, whichhad not yet been found to violate the convention+ As a result, many countriesdecriminalized homosexual conduct without equalizing the age of consent+ Between1989 and 1995 sixteen states decriminalized, but only three of them adopted equalage-of-consent laws+ This gap closed rapidly after the 1996 Sutherland decision+These patterns suggest, although they do not prove, that ECtHR judgments shapedthe timing of policy changes+Figure 2 shows the number of states that permit lesbians and gay men to serveopenly in the armed services+ The total number of countries is somewhat smallerbecause we excluded states that do not have militaries+ Discriminatory practicesrelating to the military are somewhat more difficult to code than criminal law issuesbecause in some countries express discriminatory policies do not exist but discrim-inatory practices are pervasive+ In the absence of an official policy, we requiredevidence of a systematic pattern of conduct, not merely a small number of iso-lated incidents+ We also coded as discriminatory those states that classified homo-sexuality as a psychiatric disorder, which is a ground for dismissal, harassment, ordiscrimination+ The appendix contains all coding decisions and sources+At the time of the key ECtHR judgment in 1999, less than half the memberstates had nondiscriminatory policies+ The visual evidence is suggestive of a rela-tionship between the ECtHR judgment and policy change+ Between 1991 and 1998,not a single country abandoned its discriminatory policies or practices+ During thedecade following the Lustig-Prean & Beckett judgment, sixteen countries did so+Recognition of transsexual rights is more difficult to code because it requiresjudgments about the broader context in which laws operate+ Figure 3 plots thetrends in policy adoption for two transsexual legal issues: the right to change iden-tity documents following sex reassignment surgery ~first recognized in B. v.

Second, are ICs agents of change or do theirdecisions reflect preexisting social and political trends? In the context of ECtHRjudgments on LGBT rights, we find evidence that even where international judgestake social trends into consideration, they nonetheless retain considerable discre-tion and can encourage policy change by noncompliant countries under the rightdomestic political and institutional conditions+In particular, ECtHR judgments increase the likelihood that all Europeannations—even countries whose laws and policies the court has not explicitly foundto violate the European Convention—will adopt pro-LGBT reforms+ The effect isstrongest in countries where public support for homosexuals is lowest+We are work-ing with observational data, and so cannot entirely exclude the possibility that thiseffect is caused by unobserved factors that influence both ECtHR judgments andchanges to national policies+ Yet the statistical impact of ECtHR judgments sur-vives our best efforts to address such concerns, including explicitly modeling likelyECtHR votes and controlling for LGBT issues not affected by ECtHR rulings+Perhaps our most unexpected finding is that the erga omnes effect of ECtHRjudgments is stronger in countries where public support for LGBT rights is rela-tively low+ We attribute this result primarily to national courts’ ability to strike88+ Carter and Signorino 2010+ Results available from authors+ We prefer the predicted votespecification0LGBT policy index, since the time trend captured by this variable is theoretically motivated+International Courts as Agents of Legal Change 29down domestic laws based on their incompatibility with the convention, and tothe increased political salience of an issue following ECtHR judgments that cantrigger policy change when the government in power is not ideologically opposedto reforms+ In countries with high public support, sympathetic political parties donot need the incentives provided by an ECtHR ruling, but in low-support coun-tries a judgment from Strasbourg can help legitimize and justify policy change+Moreover, courts with international review authority can step in if the legislaturedoes not adopt reforms+Our finding does not imply that the ECtHR aggressively pushes countries toadopt policies that governments and publics oppose+ Rather, the Strasbourg Courtengages in a kind of majoritarian activism+ It recognizes LGBT rights claims thatit had previously rejected only when at least a majority of CoE member stateshave already done so+ Decisions that embrace an expansive interpretation of theconvention at this juncture appear to influence lagging countries to adopt progres-sive LGBT rights policies earlier than these countries otherwise would have+ Weestimate that a judgment encourages an average of eight states to alter their poli-cies over a decade+ Since these human rights protections have meaningful conse-quences for large numbers of Europeans, this is a nontrivial effect+ But it is also amore modest effect than both boosters and critics of ICs often attribute to inter-national judicial rulings+Our empirical analysis is motivated by a theoretical framework that analyzeshow the discretionary interpretative choices of ICs can have systemic influenceson national laws and policies+ Consistent with a burgeoning literature on compli-ance with international law, we argue that this effect is conditional on domesticinstitutions and compliance constituencies+ Our framework advances this litera-ture by emphasizing the influence of international law on domestic judicial reviewand on the partisan control of government+ Our findings also have implications forthe rapidly growing number of decisions by ICs and quasi-judicial monitoring bod-ies+ We thus conclude with a roadmap for future research that considers how theerga omnes effect may operate across the broader terrain of international law+First, the mechanisms of influence we identify potentially apply not only to ICsthat issue legally binding judgments but also to IC advisory opinions and to themany international commissions, committees, and expert bodies that review gov-ernment conduct and issue nonbinding decisions and recommendations+ There aremany differences between soft and hard international law+ But those differenceshave less relevance for the erga omnes effect, because international decisions arealways nonbinding for other states regardless of whether the decisions are oblig-atory for the parties to a particular dispute+ Our findings thus open new avenuesof inquiry for research on soft international law+Second, our findings have particular relevance for other human rights regimes,in which decision makers interpret open-textured and evolutionary norms that areshaped by developments in international, regional, and national law+ The inher-ently expansive nature of these norms means that ICs and international reviewbodies—such as the courts and commissions of human rights in the Americas and30 International OrganizationAfrica, and the numerous review mechanisms established by specific human rightstreaties and by the UN Charter—are likely to encounter erga omnes issues similarto those that the ECtHR has experienced+ For example, the principles developedby UN treaty bodies when analyzing state party reports and complaints from indi-viduals and when drafting general comments may influence national courts thatreview challenges to government policies+Third, our analysis of the ECtHR may not translate as directly to ICs in otherissue areas+ For example, domestic courts generally do not interpret WTO treatiesor apply the decisions of the WTO dispute-settlement system+ Nevertheless, theissues of discretionary interpretation and systemic influence are pertinent to theWTO Appellate Body, which establishes legal principles ~for example, the illegal-ity of zeroing! intended to affect the behavior of all member nations+ The researchdesign we apply to the ECtHR could therefore be adapted to analyze the ergaomnes effects of other ICs, although the precise mechanisms and conditions maydiffer or have different weights+Finally, our study reveals that scholars studying ICs should look beyond narrowquestions of compliance to consider the systemic influence of IC interpretationsof international law+ A judgment that a defendant state does not implement maystill be effective if the court’s reasoning is widely adopted by other states+ TheUK has not ~yet! complied with the ECtHR’s prisoner voting rights judgment againstit, but the ruling led other European countries to change their policies through thedecentralized mechanisms we identify+ The opposite result may also occur+A coun-try that litigates a dispute and loses could narrowly comply with the ruling, whileother states retain policies that contravene the IC’s interpretation of their treatyobligations+ Failing to investigate either possibility could drastically over- or under-estimate the influence of ICs decisions on state behavior+ReferencesAdamczyk, Amy, and Cassady Pitt+ 2009+ Shaping Attitudes About Homosexuality: The Role of Reli-gion and Cultural Context+ Social Science Research 38 ~2!:338–51+Alter, Karen J+ 2009+

    "abstract": "Do international court judgments influence the behavior of actors other than the parties to a dispute? Are international courts agents of policy change or do their judgments merely reflect evolving social and political trends? The authors develop a theory that specifies the conditions under which international courts can use their interpretive discretion to have system-wide effects. The authors examine the theory in the context of European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) rulings on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues by creating a new dataset that matches these rulings with laws in all Council of Europe (CoE) member states. The authors also collect data on LGBT policies unaffected by ECtHR judgments to control for the confounding effect of evolving trends in national policies. The authors find that ECtHR judgments against one country substantially increase the probability of national-level policy change across Europe. The marginal effects of the judgments are especially high where public acceptance of sexual minorities is low, but where national courts can rely on ECtHR precedents to invalidate domestic laws or where the government in power is not ideologically opposed to LGBT equality. The authors conclude by exploring the implications of our findings for other international courts",
