Queer Theory, which disrupts and challenges thenorms and heteronormativity of our current systematic, norm-based systems, helps us imaginewhat schools might look like if they support LGBTQIA+ youth.Using content analysis, I createdmy own protocols to analyze the handbooks and websites of three Sacramento area schooldistricts. The findings indicated that all three school districts are providing some essentialinformation in their handbooks and in their district websites for supporting Queer youth. There isstill much work to be done to provide Queer youth with the support and services that they needto navigate the educational system.1CHAPTER IINTRODUCTIONIdentifying as Queer, as LGBTQIA+, can be incredibly difficult to grapple with,especially as a youth. My work is influenced by someone close to me that has undergone thequestioning of themselves and who identifies themselves as Queer, my younger sibling. Myinterest in exploring the types of support LGTQIA+ youth receive come from hearing my sister’sfirst-hand struggles and questioning how the school is supporting her and other LGBTQIA+youth. This made me question and become skeptical of their high school, of what they’re seeing,and what actual support there is. If my younger sibling is facing these issues in an urban area andin a blue state where there are normally more resources available, what are other studentsundergoing? Do most Queer youth struggle to find safe learning spaces? My work aims todiscover what resources are available, specifically in three of Sacramento, CA’s largest schooldistricts, how accessible they are, and how we can bridge the gaps in support for LGBTQIA+students in high school.Statement of the ProblemChallenges Faced by Queer Youth in High SchoolQueer youth face many challenges and obstacles while undergoing high school, many moreobstacles than those that identify as non-LGBTQIA+. Queer youth have been identified as at-riskstudents by the National Mental Health Association (NHMA), are susceptible to a multitude ofmental health conditions (NAMI, 2022), and many schools contain “an extremely hostileenvironment” that does not bode well for students’ health (Johnson, Singh, & Gonzalez, 2014, p.419). In the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network’s (GLSEN) most current NationalSchool Climate Survey (2019), a majority of students reported experiencing discriminatory2policies and practices in their schools (p. 6). There is a multitude of evidence that supports thenotion that effective resources and policies that provide for and protect LGBTQIA+ youth duringtheir time in school are lacking. According to the Movement Advancement Project’s (MAP)equality map, there are 25 states that have no laws protecting LGTBQIA+ students in the UnitedStates (MAP, 2021) and with the current political and social climate, this may increase in thenear future.Queer youth face unsafe school environments which can lead ultimately lead to theirdeath through violence or suicide. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)website, LGBTQIA+ youth are more than “twice as likely to report experiencing persistentfeelings of sadness or hopelessness… and Transgender youth…are twice as likely to experiencedepressive symptoms, seriously consider suicide, and attempt suicide compared to cisgenderlesbian, gay, bisexual, Queer and questioning youth” (NAMI, 2022). An obstacle that Queeryouth frequently face in schools is having a school climate filled with harassment. According tothe Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), 86.3% of LGBTQIA+ youthexpressed facing harassment or assault with a majority reporting that they did not report theirincidents because they felt that nothing would be done (GLSEN, 2019, p. 5). Many of the currenthigh school resources and policies are not providing a safe space for Queer youth and are notbeing seen as supportive of the plights that Queer youth face.An additional obstacle that Queer youth face is a lack of LGBTQIA+ curriculum and alack of inclusion in sexual health education. By excluding LGBTQIA+ youth in curriculum, itrenders them as invisible in the school system as teachings become unrelatable to them becausemany of the current teachings focus on enforcing heteronormativity and the gender binary(Helmer, 2016). In McCready’s (2010) work, they share the stories of Antione and Kevin, two3gay, gender non-conforming youth. Antoine and Kevin would sometimes “dress, speak, and actin ways considered feminine, and therefore inappropriate for their male bodies” which led to“tension in the class, particularly among some of the male dancers and drummers - and withNana [the director]” (McCready, 2010, p. 6). The tensions and inner thoughts of those interactingwith Antoine and Kevin affirm the gender binary and contribute to the divide. This lack ofinclusion in school curriculum serves as silencing LGBTQIA+ youth in the school system(Gowen & Winges-Yanez, 2013). By failing to include LGBTQIA+ inclusion in sexual healtheducation classes, or only mentioning them when in relation to AIDS, Queer youth felt that theywere being seen as an “other” - as “aliens”  and “freaks” (Gowen & Winges-Yanez, 2013, p.791).Activism of LGBTQIA+ YouthDue to LGBTQIA+ youth facing such obstacles, many become involved in activist workto combat the obstacles that they face in school, and even outside of school. Gay StraightAlliances (GSA/GSAs) function as more than just school clubs, they are a home for LGBTQIA+youth and their allies to start and strengthen their activism work. These student-run clubs harboractivism by fighting against school policies, by hosting events, by spreading the word aboutLGBTQIA+ rights and fighting for them. Youth activism can also be seen outside of school asschools are not always receptive to LGBTQIA+ students and their rights. LGBTQIA+ youth canbecome involved in extracurricular activities and programs that make a change in the communityand that may also tie back and impact the school environment. LGBTQIA+ youth activism isvital in understanding the type of support that is needed for Queer youth in high schools.4Improving School Climate for Queer Youth in High SchoolImproving the school climate for Queer youth in high schools can take many forms:improving the general climate, looking into the roles of school personnel and professionals, andreviewing the curriculum. In order to improve the school climate for Queer youth, schools mustbe open to improving the general climate of the school by engaging in different practices (e.g.gender-inclusive language, knowledge of LGBTQIA+ youth rights, privacy, and even byassisting in navigating transitions, especially in relation to school forms listing name/gender).There are a multitude of ways to improve the general climate of high schools and the SouthernPoverty Law Center provides some best practices such as providing a safe and inclusiveenvironment, encouraging staff to be allies, enforcing an equal dress-code for all, and usinginclusive language to name a few (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2013). These best practices canbe implemented in multiple areas in the schools to improve the climate.School personnel can become involved in policymaking committees to make suggestionsfor improvement in harassment and discrimination policies (Pollock, 2006) and in providingworkshops, trainings to other staff members, and even seeking additional trainings with regardsto LGBTQIA+ youth. School personnel have an obligation to assist and improve the schoolclimate for LGBTQIA+ youth. School counselors, staff, and psychiatrists are some of thepositions that work with students on the ground on a daily basis and may be best inclined toassist with implementing these changes. While we expect to rely on school personnel to assistwith enacting change in order to support LGBTQIA+ youth, there is a current deficit inproviding adequate training for school counselors and psychiatrists. Professional developmentopportunities for school personnel are needed as research shows that they are not receiving5sufficient education or training with regards to LGBTQIA+ youth (Heck, Linquist, Machek, &Cochran, 2014).Purpose of the ProjectThe aim of this field project is to conduct a critical document analysis in order to analyzeexisting Sacramento-area school district websites and student handbooks that are distributed toyouth in high schools regarding their rights and resources. The population will be three highschool districts in the Sacramento area (Twin Rivers Unified School District, Natomas UnifiedSchool District, and Sacramento City Unified School District). This analysis can be used torevise current handbooks and websites that are shared with high school youth that detail theirrights, information regarding where they can find more information regarding their rights, andavailable resources (e.g. websites, legal aid, suicide prevention, local organizations, housing).This project will be of interest to those school professionals that wish to build a more supportivecampus for their Queer youth and to those school professionals who want to spread awarenessabout student rights and resources. This project was chosen because research demonstrates thatthere is a lack of resources for Queer youth. According to the GLSEN 2019 survey, “all toomany schools fail to provide critical resources'' (GLSEN, 2019, p. 8) to LGBTQIA+ youth.Theoretical FrameworkQueer Theory is oftentimes described as being “indefinable” and ambiguous (McCann &Monaghan, 2019, p. 1). Queer Theory emerged in the 1990s in academia and the name wascoined by Teresa de Lauretis to be “deliberately disruptive” and to “challenge what was taken forgranted as ‘theory’ in the academy” (McCann & Monaghan, 2019, pp. 2-3). According toGunckel (2009), “Queer theory provides a framework for examining schools, curriculum, andpedagogy to find those identities, bodies, and experiences that have been silenced, ignored, and6rendered invisible” (p. 65). Notable contributors to Queer Theory in the 1990s were Judith Butlerwho challenged the gender binary (1990) and Michael Warner (1991) who coined the termheteronormativity, the assumption that heterosexuality is the standard and is the norm, andexplored new notions of Queer Theory and what Queer Theory actually encompasses. In the 21stcentury, there have been various authors, researchers, and theorists expanding on Queer Theory.Gunckel (2009) stated that “Queer Theory resists definition” (p. 63) and explores Queer Theorycharacteristics. About a decade later, Linville (2017) explored Queer Theory as a tenet forreframing deficits and the concept of the “deserving student” (p. 6). This section includes a briefhistory of Queer Theory which includes (in chronological order) a variety of contributors thatcontribute to the components of this theory that is always changing, always bending, and thatwill continue to evolve.A foundational scholar of Queer Theory in the 1990s was Judith Butler. Butler isfamously known for the manner in which they challenge the gender binary of “female” and“male” and heterosexism in their famous book Gender Trouble (1990), and challenged society’sthoughts on gender. Butler’s thoughts on performativity and the heterosexual norm are ofsignificant interest to understanding how homophobia [the prejudice against gay/Queer people]and sexism [a prejudice or discrimination based on gender] work in schools” (Meyer, 2007, p.18). Butler critiqued performativity and questioned outwardly showing an external appearancethat “fits'' with your assigned traditional male/female gender. Butler discussed how gender isperformative in society and how societal norms and thoughts are precise in their desired effect ongender identity (Butler, 1993, as cited in Hall et al., 2013, p. 22):Gender is performative insofar as it is the effect of a regulatory regime of genderdifferences in which genders are divided and hierarchized under constraint, Social7constraints, taboos, prohibitions, threats of punishment operate in the ritualized repetitionof norms…to the extent that this repetition creates an effect of gender uniformity, a stableeffect of masculinity and femininity…There is no subject who is “free” to stand outsidethese norms or to negotiate them at a distance; on the contrary, the subject is retroactivelyproduced by these norms in their repetition, precisely as their effectThis script on how to act is taught to children from a very young age so they live their entirelives “knowing” what represents “boys” and “girls” in our culture and [by] placing children intothese strict gender molds…[this] limits their opportunities to express their gender freely (Meyer,2007, p. 20). Meyer (2007) goes on to interpret and expand on Butler’s thoughts that “genderedharassment, which includes homophobia, harassment, (hetero) sexual harassment, andharassment for gender nonconformity, is one very clear way that society polices and reinforcesthe heterosexual matrix” (p. 20). This contribution introduced this concept of performativity andgender norms to be part of Queer Theory tenets.Michael Warner (1991) articulates and introduces the concept of heteronormativity intheir work (McCann & Monaghan, 2019) and explores Queer Theory as being more than justlesbian and gay studies. Warner states that the “task of Queer social theory...must be to confrontthe default heteronormativity of modern culture with its worst nightmare, a Queer planet”(Warner, 1991, p. 16). Warner (1991) states that this new purpose of Queer Theory is todemonstrate lesbian and gay struggles in greater detail and that being Queer means fighting forissues all the time and that Queer persons know that stigmatization is ingrained in:gender, with the family, with notions of individual freedom, the state, public speech,consumption and desire, nature and culture, maturation, reproductive politics, racial and8national fantasy, class identity, truth and trust, censorship, intimate life and social display,terror and violence, health care, and deep cultural norms about bearing of the body. (p. 6)Warner had a very futuristic thought of Queer Theory and about how they expect Queer Theoryto grow and encompass so much more than was described in the 1990s. Warner’s contribution toQueer Theory was through the exploration of this new concept of heteronormativity.Building on this foundation, Kristin Gunckel (2009) explores Queer Theory and itspurpose. Gunckel describes Queer Theory as “making the normal Queer” and that Queer Theory“disrupt[s] normative processes” (p. 63). Queer Theory may be confusing to understand to somebecause it is not defined - to define Queer Theory would be to contradict the intent of QueerTheory (Gunckel, 2009, p. 63). Queer Theory is meant to disrupt systems, current definitions,and the known. Queer Theory aims to examine how “social constructions of sexuality [are]normalized so that heterosexuality is portrayed as the only normal and natural form of beinghuman. Queer Theory reveals how truths and selves are socially constructed (Gunckel, 2009, p.63). By examining current social constructs and by disrupting current system, Queer Theoryallows researchers to imagine and to explore “out there” ideas of what could be.In relation to Gunckel’s work, Linville utilized Queer Theory to apply this to schools.According to Linville (2017), “Queer Theory has demanded that educational theorists andresearchers reframe their questions away from deficits in students to look at structuralimpediments that keep students from succeeding” (p. 6). By looking into breaking the norm ofblaming students for their “failures and shortcomings,” Linville is utilizing Queer Theory asdescribed by Gunckel - to disrupt current systems. Linville (2017) also utilizes Queer Theory toexamine the role of the “deserving student” and to “restructure the social and academicatmosphere of educational institutions to be accessible to all students” (p. 6). Queer Theory asks9us to question “what is taken for granted, natural, and normal, they ask us to see new possibilitiesand potentialities for ourselves and our students” (Linville, 2017, p. 6).  Queer Theory isimportant because it does much more than have tenets of LGBTQIA+ rights, it alsoallows us the opportunity to delve into “what ifs,” to imagine alternate societies throughdisruption.In summary, Queer Theory proposes new alternatives to our current systematic,norm-based systems. This includes foundational work from Butler (1990) that describes theperformativity of gender roles and how straying from the norms creates “the other,'' who is thensubject to the scorn and anger of those following the gender norms. Warner (1991) coins the termheteronormativity in their work that gives an explanation to an important concept in QueerTheory. Gunckel (2009) and Linville (2017) provide their thoughts on Queer Theory and itspurpose, its characteristics, and how to apply this to school-based systems. My research aims toexamine the manner in which Sacramento-area high schools are contributing to providingresources to their high school LGBTQIA+ youth that may fall outside of the norm or providingmore than just the required resources to youth who embody Queer Theory tenets.  Related to thisis a body of research that demonstrates the practical application of Queer Theory. Chapter 2describes this research and justifies the claim that we must know the challenges thatQueer/LGBTQIA+ youth face in high school in order to be able to effectively provide support.MethodologyThis field project will be informed by a critical document analysis of threeSacramento-area school district websites and their respective student handbooks. Documentanalysis will be used to collect and analyze current materials and website resources in order tosuggest revisions to current materials. By analyzing the current resources that are given and10available to students, I will be able to examine what the current resources are and what can bechanged to provide extra support for Queer youth. I will analyze the resources and check whetherthey meet fifteen protocols ranging from resources for suicide prevention to current proceduresfor reporting staff/teachers/school professionals for discrimination and/or harassment. Once thedata are collected and analyzed, they will be used to mend gaps in support for LGBTQIA+ youthby providing accessible materials regarding their rights and resources.Significance of the ProjectThis field project may be of interest to students, families, administrators, and schoolpersonnel and professionals. It may hold significance for those youth that identify as LGBTQIA+because there is currently a lack of available resources for Queer youth. Making these materialsavailable and implementing them in the school system will be an important step to support ourQueer youth.  In addition, this field project may also interest families because schools will beproviding materials to encourage diversity and ensuring that all students are attending a spacethat is safe for them. Finally, this field project may be important to administrators, schoolpersonnel/staff, and professionals because they will be given resources that are made to supportthem in their roles, foster better relationships amongst Queer youth, and gain trainings andunderstandings regarding Queer youth as there is a current lack of education and knowledge onhow to support LGBTQIA+ youth.Limitations of ProjectThe limitations of this project are various as this is a qualitative study and focuses onlyon a specific region in the Sacramento area. This study focuses on three school districts, a verysmall sample, so we cannot make assumptions or generalizations of all school districts based oninformation solely from these three school districts. Another limitation is that this study is based11on content analysis. It is impossible to know if the documents that were analyzed shape reality orreflect reality. It is most likely a combination of both, but it is impossible to know.Definition of Terms  Throughout my research and field work, there are a multitude of terms that are frequently used inthe LGBTQIA+ community and in LGBTQIA+ discourse. The following terms are integral andcome up in various parts of my own work and of others. The below definitions should clarify anddefine the terms.● At-risk students: According to The Glossary of Education Reform, “the term at-risk isoften used to describe students or groups of students who are considered to have a higherprobability of failing academically or dropping out of school” (Ed Glossary, 2013).● Cisgender: “A term used to describe a person whose gender identity aligns with thosetypically associated with the sex assigned to them at birth” (Human Rights Campaign,n.d.)● Coming Out: “The process in which a person first acknowledges, accepts andappreciates their sexual orientation or gender identity and begins to share that withothers” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)● Gender Binary: “Pervasive within the US school system is the heteronormative cultureor dominant socio-cultural belief system that reinforces and perpetuates heterosexualprivilege and anti-gay prejudice by accepting as valid only a strict binary male/femalesocially contructed conception of sexuality” (Steck & Perry, 2015, p. 327).“A system in which gender is constructed into two strict categories of male or female.Gender identity is expected to align with the sex assigned at birth and gender expressionsand roles fit traditional expectations” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)12● Gender expression: “External appearance of one's gender identity, usually expressedthrough behavior, clothing, body characteristics or voice, and which may or may notconform to socially defined behaviors and characteristics typically associated with beingeither masculine or feminine” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)● Gender Identity: “One’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both orneither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One'sgender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth” (HumanRights Campaign, n.d.)● Gender Non-Conforming: “A broad term referring to people who do not behave in away that conforms to the traditional expectations of their gender, or whose genderexpression does not fit neatly into a category. While many also identify as transgender,not all gender non-conforming people do” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)● Gender Performativity: “Judith Butler questions the belief that certain genderedbehaviors are natural, illustrating the ways that one's learned performance of genderedbehavior (what we commonly associate with femininity and masculinity) is an act ofsorts, a performance, one that is imposed upon us by normative heterosexuality” (Felluga,2011)● Heteronomativity: “the assumption that heterosexuality is the standard for definingnormal sexual behavior and that male–female differences and gender roles are the naturaland immutable essentials in normal human relations. According to some social theorists,this assumption is fundamentally embedded in, and legitimizes, social and legalinstitutions that devalue, marginalize, and discriminate against people who deviate from13its normative principle (e.g., gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, transgendered persons)”(American Psychological Association, n.d.)● Homophobia: “The fear and hatred of or discomfort with people who are attracted tomembers of the same sex” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)● LGBTQIA+: “An acronym for “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,” intersex,asexual…with a \"+\" sign to recognize the limitless sexual orientations and genderidentities used by members of the community” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)This term is used interchangeably with the term ‘Queer’ throughout this work andresearch. This term is used instead of the popular ‘LGBT/LGBT+’ term to encompassmore marginalized persons in research when reading and speaking the term.● Non-Binary: “An adjective describing a person who does not identify exclusively as aman or a woman. Non-binary people may identify as being both a man and a woman,somewhere in between, or as falling completely outside these categories. While manyalso identify as transgender, not all non-binary people do. Non-binary can also be used asan umbrella term encompassing identities such as agender, bigender, genderqueer orgender-fluid” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)● Normative: “Of, relating to, or determining norms or standards; conforming to or basedon norms” (Merriam-Webster, n.d.)● Norm: “standards of proper or acceptable behavior; something (such as a behavior orway of doing something) that is usual or expected” (Merriam-Webster, n.d.)● Queer: “Often used as a catch-all to include many people, including those who do notidentify as exclusively straight and/or folks who have non-binary or gender-expansive14identities. This term was previously used as a slur, but has been reclaimed by many partsof the LGBTQ+ movement” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.).This term is used interchangeably alongside ‘LGBTQIA+’ throughout the work.● Questioning: “A term used to describe people who are in the process of exploring theirsexual orientation or gender identity” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)● Sexual Orientation: “An inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexualattraction to other people. Note: an individual’s sexual orientation is independent of theirgender identity” (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.)15CHAPTER IIREVIEW OF THE LITERATUREThis literature review makes the claim that it is important to understand what challengesQueer youth face in high schools, and what resources are available to them, in order to identifyand rectify gaps in support. The body of scholarship that justifies this claim includes three sets ofevidence that demonstrate that: (a) Queer youth, or perceived Queer youth, face specificchallenges in high school; (b) LGBTQIA+ youth engage in activism to enact change andacceptance; (c) it is important to improve school climate for Queer youth in high schools.  QueerTheory can be used to frame this body of scholarship.Challenges Faced by Queer Youth in High SchoolResearch demonstrates that Queer youth, and those preceived as Queer, face manychallenges in high school. This section includes research that provides evidence of a lack ofresources at the high school level, including a lack of effective policies in protecting LGBTQIA+youth during their time in school. Research also includes a discussion based on the lack ofLGBTQIA+ school curriculum, including a lack of sexual health education for LGBTQIA+youth. Finally, this section also addresses the school climate which very often includes thebullying of LGBTQIA+ youth. It is important to recognize the various challenges that Queeryouth face in order to identify how high schools are lacking in supporting their LGBTQIA+youth and in identifying potential solutions to improve Queer youth experiences, or thoseperceived as Queer, in high school.Research illustrates that there is a lack of resources and effective policies in place tosupport LGBTQIA+ students in high schools. According to Johnson et al. (2014), LGBTQIA+students navigate “extremely hostile environments” and “there are very few school-based16interventions designed to keep them safe” (p. 419) during students’ time in schools.  Schools arecurrently functioning as systems of discrimination and prejudice by rejecting or failing toimplement personnel training on heterosexism and homophobia for schoolstaff/personnel/administrators (Johnson, Singh, & Gonzalez, 2014, p. 422) and there are either alack of policies in place to protect LGBTQIA+ youth or the current policies in place are ignoredor enforced in a discriminatory manner.According to Biegel and Kuehl (2010), there are both “structural and institutionalfailures” within schools (pp. 3-4). Schools are failing to recognize the importance of LGBTQIA+educators, and schools are failing to recognize and address the homophobia in many sportsprograms (Biegel & Kuehl, 2010, pp. 3-4). Teacher education programs and professionaldevelopment programs are failing to focus and cover topics relating to LGBTQIA+ youth(Biegel & Huehl, 2010, pp. 3-4), and schools are failing to recognize and speak aboutLGBTQIA+ youth in additional on-site trainings and inservices. As LGBTQIA+ and gendernon-conforming students are more likely to feel unsafe in schools, they “often stop coming toclasses regularly; many drop out, run away from home, or attempt suicide” (Biegal & Kuegl,2010, p. 3). These students have been identified as at-risk students (exposed to the possibility ofdanger, harm, or loss) by the National Mental Health Association (NMHA).According to the Movement Advancement Project’s (MAP) equality map based onnondiscrimination safe schools laws, there are currently 25 states that have no laws protectingLGBTQIA+ students in the United States and two states that have laws that prevent schools fromadding LGBTQIA+ protections to nondiscrimination policies (MAP, 2021). Similarly, theresearch presented in the most current Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network’s (GLSEN)National School Climate Survey (2019) states that most LGBTQIA+ students (59.1%) reported17that they personally experienced LGBTQ+-related discriminatory policies and practices at school(GLSEN, 2019, p. 6). Students reported being prevented from using the bathrooms assigned withtheir gender identity, were disciplined for public displays of affection that were not similarlydisciplined among non-LGBTQ+ students, prevented from using locker rooms aligned with theirgender identity, prevented from using chosen names/pronouns, prevented from wearing clothingconsidered “inappropriate” based on gender or prevented from wearing clothing that supportedLGBTQ+ issues, prohibited from discussing or writing about LGBTQ+ topics in schoolassignments, prohibited from including LGBTQ+ topics in school-based extracurricularactivities, restricted from forming or promoting a Gay Straight Alliance (GSA),  prevented ordiscouraged from particpating in school sports because they were LGBTQ+, prevented fromattending school dances with someone of the same gender, and even being disciplined foridentifying as LGBTQ+ (GLSEN, 2019, p. 6). According to the multitude of research, schoolsare currently lacking in resources and policies to support LGBTQIA+ or those students perceivedas Queer.In relation to the lack of school resources and policies, there is also currently an exclusionof LGBTQIA+ coverage in school curriculum, including a lack of coverage in sexual healtheducation classes. This exclusion and lack of coverage renders LGBTQIA+ youth as invisible inthe school system and causes some teachings to be un-relatable to this group of students. This isespecially true in traditional teachings that enforce heteronormativity, the gender binary (genderas being only male or female), and nuclear families (an adult couple and their children) (e.g.focusing on heterosexual sexual health education topics) (Helmer, 2016). Reflecting the societalnorms, schools are based on the dominant heteronormative culture - which, in turn, means all of18the adopted materials and textbooks, the assignments, rules and routines enforce heteronormativepractices and policies (Steck & Perry, 2015).In support of these claims, Gowen and Winges-Yanez (2013) conducted researchregarding LGBTQQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Questioning) youth andtheir perspectives on inclusive sexual education. Gowen and Yanez (2013) found that a lack ofinclusion was a dominant theme across their work. In the focus groups of this research, it wasdiscovered that there were two types of silencing when discussing sexuality education - passivesilencing and active silencing. Passive silencing is when “LGBTQ discourse was completelyabsent from sexuality education curricula” and active silencing is when “LGBTQ youth weresilenced by another'' - educators ignoring or avoiding questions that arose (Gowen &Winges-Yanez, 2013, p. 791). With the sexual education curriculum lacking LGBTQIA+ issuesand representation, and with educators refusing to discuss such issues or stating that LGBTQIA+issues were not allowed to be discussed, youth expressed that they felt like they were othered -they felt like they were “aliens” or “freaks.” The only times youth noticed LGBTQIA+ inclusionin their sexual health education course was when the discussion of AIDS would occur whichupset some of the participants as this was stigmatizing LGBTQIA+ persons (Gowen &Winges-Yanez, 2013, p. 792) by only mentioning them in this context and ignoring theirpresence in all other aspects of sexual health education.According to Steck and Perry (2015), the current curriculum taught in the U.S. is limitingand excludes Queer content which results in denying students an equitable and balancededucation. In order to enact change, Queer materials need to be fully integrated into thecurriculum with the purpose to diversify the human experience in order to make change; todisrupt and deconstruct heteronormativity and the dominant gender binary (p. 329). The19curriculum process should seek more than just tolerance, it should seek to “foster recognition,acceptance, inclusion, and affirmation of human diversity” (Steck & Perry, 2015, p. 330). Amajor fear of incorporating LGBTQIA+ discussions in the classroom and an argument againstdoing so is that such conversations are inappropriate because people fear that students learningabout these topics will result in the practice of homosexuality, but in fact, these conversationsensure that students are “less likely to insult someone and less likely to ostracize LGBTQIA+persons” (Flores, 2012, p. 129). Non-gender conforming and non-heterosexual persons exist soinstead of pretending that they do not, and trying to hide the fact that students and children knowabout them, schools should be embracing an inclusive curriculum.LGBTQIA+ and Queer perceived youth, encounter a school climate filled withharassment during their time in school. Many instances of harassment are often not reported andare made invisible. The GLSEN 2019 National School Climate Survey (2019) reported that86.3% of LGBTQIA+ students experienced harassment in the forms of verbal, physical, sexual,and electronic harassment as well as physical assault. A majority of students (56.6%) did notreport their incidents because they felt that no “effective intervention would occur or thesituation could become worse if reported” (GLSEN, 2019, p. 5). For those that did report, 60.5%of students stated that school staff did nothing in response or were advised to “ignore it”(GLSEN, 2019, p. 5).According to researchers, an increase in LGBTQIA+ bullying was connected to schoolpersonnel ignoring or “looking the other way when heterosexist/homophobic incidents ofbullying occur” and also by denying the existence of LGBTQIA+ students (Johnson, Singh, &Gonzalez, 2014, p. 421). An example of a worsening climate and an increase in bullying due to alack of action is shown in Blackburn and McCready (2009) who describe an experience by an20openly gay student named Dylan who was bullied because of their sexual orientation. Dylandiscusses an incident that involves six students that surrounded Dylan and threw a lasso aroundtheir [Dylan’s] neck and stated “let’s tie the faggot to the back of the truck” (Blackburn &McCready, 2009, p. 223). The administration did nothing to reprimand the six students andadvised Dylan to not discuss their sexual orientation with other students. The bullying,harassment, and violence did not wane or decrease but instead increased after no action wastaken by the administration.Berry (2018) states that “school bullying is an oppressive mode of interpersonal conflictthat rattles the bodies and beings of young people'' (p. 502) and goes on to state that feeling safeshould be an essential state of being (p. 506). LGBTQIA+ students experience hostile schoolenvironments and experience bullying, harassment, discrimination, and assault in various forms(e.g. verbal, physical, sexual, online/electronic), in schools across the nation. According to the2019 GLSEN National School Climate Survey, 59.1% of LGBTQ students expressed feelingunsafe in their school because of their sexual orientation (p. 3) and 86.3% of LGBTQ studentsexpressed being harassed or assaulted (p. 4). GLSEN also reports that some effects of a hostileschool climate include a higher likelihood of missing school, a lower GPA, becoming twice aslikely not to plan to pursue any post-secondary education, a lower self-esteem, and higher levelsof depression. The norm for many LGBTQIA+ youth, or for those youths perceived as Queer, isto attend school with a fear of harassment and assault, a fear of enclosed spaces where violenceoften occurs and is hidden from others, and even being in an academic space where their safetymay be ignored by their school administration. LGBTQIA+ students live in an alternative realitywhere they stay home out of fear for their well-being, not because they want to be away from21school, but because they are thrusted into an environment where they have to be vigilant at alltimes (Berry, 2018, p. 506).In summary, research demonstrates that Queer youth, and those perceived as Queer, facea multitude of challenges attempting to survive through high school. This includes research thatdemonstrates a lack of resources for LGBTQIA+ youth in high schools, as well as a lack ofeffective policies protecting LGBTQIA+ youth. Research also articulates that there is a lack ofinclusive LGBTQIA+ school curriculum, as well as a lack of inclusive sexual health educationclasses, which contributes to the invisibility of Queer youth. Research also illustrates that schoolclimate very often includes the bullying of LGBTQIA+ youth with the inclusion of harassmentand assault in various means. Taking all this research together justifies that we must understandthe challenges and current resources available to Queer youth in high school in order to evaluateand identify gaps in support.Activism of LGBTQIA+ YouthDue to facing a multitude of challenges in schools, LGBTQIA+ youth engage in activismto combat the discrimination, heterosexism, and homophobia that is present in high schools andin the world. This section of the literature review includes research that demonstrates that GayStraight Alliances (GSA) are more than just a school club - GSAs are a home for LGBTQIA+students to join, practice, and strengthen their activism while in school. While GSAs andin-school activism are needed to change the school culture, change may also occur by becominginvolved outside of school by engaging in extracurricular activities. This is important becauseQueer youth and allies engaging in activism are needed in the fight against heterosexism andhomophobia. Activism work allows us to not only identify the challenges that Queer youth face22but to rectify any gaps in support and imagine a more equitable, inclusive world for LGBTQIA+persons.To begin, Gay Straight Alliances (GSA) can be a hub for student-led activism. GSAsallow a space for students to enhance and practice their activism by fighting to make change intheir schools by contesting the gender binary, gender norms, and heteronormativity in amultitude of ways. According to Elliot (2015) and their observations made regarding a highschool GSA, the students of the club engaged in activism by fighting for a gender-neutralrestroom and by hosting inclusive health presentations during sexual education courses. TheGSA students campaigned for a gender-neutral bathroom and were granted the use of oneon-campus bathroom - they were able to provide at least one safe space for LGBTQIA+ students.By presenting to their fellow peers during a sex education class, the GSA students were able toshare their experiences and viewpoints regarding gender and sex and to come out to the differentclassrooms. The GSA students allowed their fellow peers to ask questions, to hear theirexperiences regarding homophobia they’ve experienced, their own narratives about gender andsex, and to make their presence known in their heteronormative school. Activism does notalways have to be upfront protests; sometimes activism takes the form of being present, beingout, and facilitating change in that manner.Similarly, in Hsu’s work (2017) about how they support their LGBTQIA+ students, theirschool’s GSA hosts a variety of events from celebrating Pride Month, to hosting an annual Dayof Silence, to facilitating drag shows for their school and community, and even coordinatingtrainings for the school’s teachers.  Providing these spaces for students, staff, and the communityto come together to celebrate and participate in these events is activism. The students hostingthese events are agents of change - they are attempting to change the culture of their school into23one that is more accepting. GSAs can be a great resource for students to become involved andstrengthen their activism.Related to this, youth activism is not only seen in schools. There are times when schoolsare not accepting of change and where GSAs or other similar clubs are not available or accepted.Extracurricular activities are another manner in which LGBTQIA+ youth are exposed to andpractice activism. According to Blackburn (2004), schools may actually prohibit youth fromengaging in activism while in school (p. 104) so these students must look elsewhere to find aspace and place to make necessary change. Youth that become involved in extracurricularactivities outside of school can enact change both in and out of school. Blackburn (2004) sharestheir experience of encountering youth activism while they volunteered at The Attic inPhiladelphia. The Attic has a Speakers Bureau which consists of “trained peer educators whoconduct outreaches on topics such as HIV/AIDS, safer sex, sexuality, suicide, substance abuse,heterosexism, and homophobia to youth and youth sergice providers in schools, organizations,and health care facilities” (Blackburn, 2004, p. 104). Youth were able to participate in thisSpeakers Bureau and spread awareness both inside of schools but also outside to theircommunities and are engaging in activism work that combats homophobia and heterosexism.In total, research demonstrates that LGBTQIA+ youth activism is vital in understandingthe type of support that is needed.  This includes research that states that activism can be inschool - standing up for oneself against a teacher, including oneself in class work where they arenot visible - but it can also be outside of school - leaving school because it is unsafe, working inan out-of-school context in order to educate oneself or others on issues of social change or tocombat these institutions  (Blackburn, 2004, p. 109). The research about youth LGBTQIA+activism justifies that activism is necessary and that we must understand why youth are wanting24to enact change in order to discover the types of support that are needed and where the gaps insupport are in order to provide effective assistance and support to LGBTQIA+ youth.Improving School Climate for Queer Youth in High SchoolWith relation to the literature on challenges and activism, a body of scholarshipdemonstrates how to improve school climate for Queer youth. This includes research onimproving the general climate for high school students who identify as LGBTQIA+.  It alsoincludes scholarship that explains the role of various high school staff and their connection toQueer youth in high schools and their contributions to the high school climate.  A third themethat moves toward improving the climate for Queer youth is a change in curriculum. This isimportant because it helps to justify the claim that it is important to understand what challengesQueer youth face in high school in order to identify and rectify gaps in support - a change inclimate is a hopeful step towards improvement and rectifying these gaps in support.To begin, research and project work completed by the Southern Poverty Law Center(2013) demonstrates that there are various best practices for creating an LGBT+ inclusive schoolclimate. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (2013), having inclusive leaders andallies that “promote a safe and inclusive environment are essential” (p. 2) because it creates “aculture in which other staff members are unafraid to be allies” (p. 2). In relation to creating aculture of acceptance, schools should equally enforce dress codes as youth use clothing as a formof self-expression and schools can “empower students” to be themselves (Southern Poverty LawCenter, 2013, p. 3). For those students that do not conform to gender norms, they can feelexcluded in extra-curricular activies and events, especially in events like prom, so schools shoulduse “gender-inclusive language on all event communications, including invitations” and “eventorganizers [should be educated] about students’ First Amendement right to attend events with a25same-sex date and to wear clothing of their choice” (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2013, p. 3).Having coordinators and students aware of these rights before the event can ensure that allparties are understanding of the regulations and can avoid fallout at the actual event. In addition,offering assistance and guidance with regards to paperwork that incorrectly lists their gender forthose students that are gender non-conforming, transgender, and intersex ensures that staff andpeers address them using their preferred pronouns (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2013, p. 3).There should also be the inclusion and designation of gender-neutral restrooms as restrooms arevery often non-safe spaces for Queer/gender non-conforming students (Southern Poverty LawCenter, 2013, p. 3). The Southern Poverty Law Center (2013) continues by adding that privacy isessential - staff should never reveal a student’s sexual orientation or gender identity without thestudent’s permission. Four out of ten Queer youth state that they feel they are unsafe where theylive so it is “absolutely imperative that educators respect a student’s right to privacy” (SouthernPoverty Law Center, 2013, p.3).Related to climate improvement, school personnel also have an obligation to assist andimprove the school climate for LGBTQIA+ youth. School counselors, staff, and psychiatrists aresome of the positions that work with students on the ground on a daily basis. Various researchstates that school counselors and school psychiatrists are in an “ideal position to address theissues” (Pollock, 2006, p. 33) for Queer youth and can also “influence and advise principals andpolicymaking committees to establish and enforce policies forbidding homophobicdiscrimination” (Pollock, 2006, p. 34).  Enforcing and creating effective anti-bullying policies isa manner in which school personnel can assist in creating a better school climate. Anti-bullyingpolicies should include specific language “prohibiting harassment based on nonconformity togender norms, gender identity and expression” (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2013, pp. 3-4),26they should be frequently evaluated based on feedback, and that the “reactions to reports ofharassment do not further stigmatize those who were targeted” (Southern Poverty Law Center,2013, p. 4).According to Greytak et al. (2013), schools that contain anti-bullying/anti-harassmentpolicies that specify “protections from victimization based on sexual orientation, gender identity,or gender expression experience less harassment” (p. 47). School counselors can also “influenceand advise principals and policymaking committees to establish and enforce policies forbiddinghomophobic discrimination” (Pollock, 2006, p. 34) and school psychologists are also “ideallysuited to ensure that schools are safe places for all students by specifically targeting the issue ofbullying and victimization in our schools… [they] also improve school climate by establishingcomprehensive antidiscrimination policies” (Heck, Linquist, Machek, & Cochran, 2014, p. 33).These actions are, in fact, part of the American School Counseling Association guidelines withregards to diversity (Pollock, 2006, p. 34) so they should be implemented by school counselorsand psychiatrists in order to protect students and offer a safe school environment.Maru Gonzalez conducted research regarding counselor experiences and found therewere four thematic categories in which school counselor support for LGBT+ youth wasdescribed as: “(a) student advocacy, (b) education as advocacy, (c) systems advocacy, and (d)social/political advocacy” (Gonzalez, 2018, p. 41). “Student advocacy” work was classified asactions such as  providing individual support, serving as an advisor to LGBT-friendly groups,providing access to research, and assisting students in developing strategies to navigate barriersand overcome adversity (Gonzalez, 2018, p. 41). “Education as advocacy” is seen as providingLGBT+ education to staff, students, and even themselves (Gonzalez, 2018, p. 41). “Systemsadvocacy” is work such as assisting with the process of name changes for students and families,27collecting school data and developing anti bullying initiatives/curriculum/committees, and evenproviding visible displays of support in their office to increase visibility of inclusive spaces(Gonzalez, 2018, p. 42). “Social/political advocacy” was described as “working to create changefor and with LGBT+ students beyond the school level through community collaboration andlegislative activism” (Gonzalez, 2018, p. 42). These four types of advocacy from schoolcounselors are ways in which current school counselors provide support for their LGBT+students that may work for others.According to various researchers, school counselors are also in a position to “facilitatetraining sessions for faculty, staff, parents, and students for the purpose of improving awarenessand education about heterosexism, homophobia, and the dangers of bullying” (Pollock, 2006, p.34). Diversity trainings for students that encompass diverse conversations and bullying as a topic(behavior that classifies as bullying, the negative impact of bullying, how to respond to bullying,consequences for bullying, and the process for reporting bullying) are methods that the schoolcommunity can take part in to create a more inclusive and safe environment for all involved.Similarly, Flores’ (2012) idea about providing multicultural education and sexual orientationworkshops for school leaders, staff, and administration about pedagogy, sexual diversity, andschool policies amongst other topics (p. 192) aligns with the Southern Poverty Law Center’sbelief and suggestion of training for educators/staff. Mary Gonzalez (2018) classified that somecounselors currently use an “education as advocacy” approach which is described as educatingstudents about LGBT+ issues, educating school personnel, and even educating themselvesthrough various professional development opportunities to enhance their own knowledge (p. 42).While the default may be to rely on school personnel to enact change in order to supporttheir LGBTQIA+ students, there is also a current deficit in providing school counselors and28psychiatrists with adequate training. According to Heck, Lindquist, Machek, and Cochran(2013), school personnel “commonly report that they are unsure of appropriate actions inresponse to anti-gay bullying, and feel they are inadequately trained to do so” (p. 33). There is aneed for ongoing professional development for school personnel as they are not receivingsufficient education or training with regards to LGBTQIA+ youth and research has found that“graduate counseling trainees primarily received LGBT-related information within a single classor lecture” and that there is a “lack of LGBT-specific school counselor training” (Kull, Kosciw,& Greytak, 2017, p. 14). There is a current need to provide, and to keep providing, opportunitiesfor school mental health professionals to seek additional training and opportunities forprofessional growth. Those counselors that expressed “more exposure to LGBT-related graduateeducation and professional development also reported higher self-efficacy and more frequentLGBT-related practice” (Kull, Kosciw, and Greytak, 2017, p. 17). While eliminating all bullyingis unrealistic, research does show that at least half of all bullying can be prevented (Pollock,2006, p. 34-35).A final body of research claims that an inclusive curriculum can lead to an improvementin climate for LGBTQIA+ youth. According to Steck and Perry (2015), “Queer-inclusivecurriculum creates spaces for students to engage in open dialogue... [which is] shown to improveintergroup relations and reduce fear and discomfort interacting with typically marginalized andstigmatized group members” (p. 332).  Secondary school leaders should be providing aninclusive environment that supports their students’ “physical, psycho-social, and cognitivedevelopment” (Steck & Perry, 2015, p. 328). When educators purposefully choose texts thatfunction as counternarratives for Queer persons, they allow students to “develop a historicizedunderstanding of the construction of gender, sexuality, and sex” and to ensure that such texts are29read in ways “that uncover radical potential” (Helmer, 2016, p. 913). By ensuring andincorporating an inclusive curriculum, schools and educators are promoting equal treatment andacceptance of all persons. Excluding Queer-inclusive curriculum sends a message to “all studentsthat there is something deviant about people who identify as Queer and invalidates theircontribution to society, culture, and history” (Steck & Perry, 2015, p. 331). This inclusivecurriculum provides “Queer students and their heterosexual peers with an opportunity to explore,learn, and understand the historical, social, and cultural contrinbutions by the Queer communityin science, art, family, sports, social movements, and other areas that shape the world” (Steck &Perry, 2015, p. 332). The inclusion of Queer content in curricula and in instructional materialsprovides all students with a more open view about various aspects of life.In order to improve the school climate, states and the federal government must be willingto implement changes to their laws and policies. State and federal laws should adhere to currentpolicies that protect LGBTQIA+ youth and provide protection to all students. In the CaliforniaEducation Code, there are a multitude of laws and policies protecting LGBTQIA+ youth. Forexample, sections 200-220 of the the education code protects students from “different kinds ofbias and discrimination, including harassment based on actual or perceived sexual orientation,gender identity, or gender expression” (American Civil Liberties Union of California, 2013)while also prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity or expression which includesrespecting one’s pronouns and allowing one to dress as it relates to their gender identity(American Civil Liberties Union of California, 2013). There are current federal and state lawsthat positively contribute to improving the school climate for LGBTQIA+ youth but whetherthey are being adhered to, or effectively implemented, needs to be examined.30In summary, research demonstrates how to improve climate for Queer youth. Thisincludes research that illustrates how to improve the general climate for high school youth whoidentify as LGBTQIA+ by various means. The Southern Poverty Law Center has establishedvarious best practices and other researchers have supported that to improve school climate,schools should have inclusive leaders and allies, equally enforce dress codes, utilizegender-inclusive language, have all persons involved in event coordination aware of student’srights, use preferred pronouns, provide access to gender-neutral restrooms, and ensure studentprivacy.  Research also claims that to improve school climate, school personnel can support themission to improve school conditions for Queer youth. School counselors, staff, and psychiatristscan assist in this mission by enforcing and creating effective anti-bullying policies, in facilitatingtraining sessions, and in seeking additional education and training. Taken together, this body ofresearch justifies that in order to understand what challenges Queer youth face, we must knowwhat resources are available in order to help rectify any gaps in support.SummaryUnderstanding what challenges LGBTQIA+ youth face in high school and identifyingwhat resources are available to them is vital.  Both of these are necessary in order to identify andrectify gaps in support. The body of scholarship that justifies this claim includes three sets ofresearch that demonstrate that: (a) Queer youth (and those seen as Queer youth) face specificchallenges; (b) LGBTIA+ youth engage in important activism; and (c) it is important to improveschool climate for Queer youth.  Queer Theory was used to frame this body of scholarshipbecause the research that is conducted takes in tenets of Queer Theory - what it is and what itaims to do. Queer Theory aims to disrupt current systems, to disrupt the binary. With my thesis, Iaim to utilize the tenets of Queer Theory to undergo a critical document analysis in order to31provide suggestions for selected documents. I propose to provide three high schools districts withsuggestions for improving their website and documents to be more encompassing forLGBTQIA+ youth with regards to fifteen selected protocols. I aim to assist in providing schoolswith a better understanding of their LGBTQIA+ youth in order to be able to provide support.32CHAPTER IIITHE PROJECT AND ITS DEVELOPMENTBrief Description of the ProjectFor this research, I focused on the critical document analysis of three Sacramento-areahigh school districts and their respective websites and student handbooks. I conducted a searchfor factors that impact LGBTQIA+ high school students in order to create a protocol. Examplesof such factors are references to anti-bullying policies and protocols, information and steps forreporting harassment, discrimination, or bullying, resources for anxiety and depression, andstudent rights.Given the multitude of factors that impact high school LGBTQIA+ students, this criticaldocument analysis focuses on analyzing these handbooks and websites to gauge how these threeschool districts are including information with regards to LGBTQIA+ students regarding theirrights, the ease of access to information, and policies and regulations that affect Queer youth inhigh school.Development of the ProjectThis project was inspired by conversations with my younger sister, my curiosity withregards to the sorts of resources given and available to Queer high school students, and mysister’s experiences in her high school. My sister identifies as both Queer and as a high schoolstudent, which led to my interest in this specific population. When undergoing open discussionand conversations with my sister, I began to question whether she knew her rights, whether sheknew where to look for this information, and whether her school and school district wereproviding students with the appropriate resources.33During my sister’s second year of high school, she faced a very negative and difficultexperience with one of her teachers. This teacher was vocally anti-Trans, anti-immigrant, andfrequently forced their political and personal beliefs onto their students. We had previouslysubmitted a complaint against this teacher for being fatphobic and making harsh and negativecomments towards students that could not meet what seemed like impossible physical educationassignments. This initial complaint was completely ignored (we believe due to nepotism). Afterthe teacher continued to berate and intimidate their students, my sister and a couple of herfriends, who were sophomores at the time, made the decision to report this teacher to theiradministration. They sent the complaints through email communication to their administrationand ensured they included all of their teachers on the email, as well as included screenshots andrecordings of their Zoom chats/class as proof, so that they could not be ignored. We neverreceived the results or any further communication of this investigation after the initial interviewsbut we know this teacher is not currently teaching at the school but they do show up as a teacheron the school website.Queer youth face many obstacles - both similar to my sister’s experience(s) but alsovastly different. Queer youth need to know where they can go to find the support and servicesthat they need when they need them. The thought of questioning where these resources are andwhat they are prompted the initial stages of this project. These concerns led me to conduct acritical document analysis.Through critical document analysis, I had to narrow down what it was that I was lookingfor, whether I wanted to look at individual schools or school districts, and which documents anditems I wanted to analyze. I knew I wanted to research Sacramento-area school districts becauseI am a Sacramento native and have been a part of this community since birth. It was important to34me to conduct research in an area that had significant ties to my identity and personaldevelopment.I initially began by reaching out to two larger LGBTQ+ organizations to receive feedbackand assistance with my project and to see if my research could assist their organization in anyway. I received a response back that they did not have any contacts in the area and were unsurehow they would be able to assist with my project but wished me well. This then led to thedecision to create my own protocols of what I wanted to look for and narrowing the focus fromexamining different handouts and documentation given to students throughout the school year tofocusing on district handbooks and websites. I pulled from topics in my literature review,alongside topics that fit with state legislation to develop the content analysis protocol used toreview the documents.In the California Education Code, there are a multitude of laws and policies protectingLGBTQIA+ youth’s rights. Per the ACLU (2013), schools must have an anti-harassment policywith a clear policy on how to report harassment and prevent retaliation of those that disclose.Education Code Section 220 states the prohibition of discrimination against someone based on amultitude of factors such as gender identity and expression, which includes allowing youth toutilize their chosen name and gender pronouns, expressing themselves in a manner that confirmstheir gender identity or dressing in non-confirming ways, and “providing access tosex-segregated spaces such as restrooms and lockers room…in a way that corresponds to yourgender identity” (ACLU, 2013). Youth are also protected with regards to privacy; i.e., no one hasthe right to out you without your permission (unless under certain circumstances) (ACLU, 2013).The ACLU (2013) states that Gay-Straight-Alliances (GSAs) have a right to meet like any othernon-curricular club on the school’s campus with the same rights as other clubs (e.g. hanging up35posters, having fundraisers, etc.) California Education Code 51500 states that public schoolscannot instruct students or condone activities that reflect a bias or discrimination against anyperson because of their sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity or expression (ACLU,2013). Finding resources that lay out LGBTQIA+ student’s rights is critical in allowing us tofight for Queer youth rights and to rectify any gaps in support.To find the available and most current district handbooks (2021-2022), I went to eachschool district’s website and searched for their handbooks (Natomas Unified School District,Sacramento City Unified School District, and Twin Rivers Unified School District). For each ofthe protocols, I went page by page to see if there were any resources available in the handbooksthat correlate with that specific factor. I created a matrix where I was able to list page numbersand direct quotes from the handbooks for that factor. The handbooks did not provide too manyreferences to outside resources but included the necessary information they are obligated to sharewith students and families, which was expected.For the research of district websites, I utilized the “search” feature on each districtwebsite and typed in keywords for each protocol to see what resources were available. Idiscovered that while some protocols were easily found, some were vague. For example, whensearching for anxiety resources, I would be directed to general mental health resources. Whilethe mental health resource may support anxiety management, it wasn’t directly geared towardsproviding a direct resource or tips for anxiety and anxiety management. To organize my research,I utilized the same chart I used when analyzing the handbooks and included columns for thiswork. I included links and notes from the websites since they’re easily accessible through thelinks.36Analysis of the District MaterialsThis project will be broken into fifteen sections based on the different factors in theprotocol. Analysis includes both the district handbooks and district websites under each sectionfor each district.Anti-Bullying/Nondiscrimination PoliciesSchool bullying is a major factor that affects Queer youth throughout their educationalendeavors. LGBTQIA+ youth experience hostile school environments and experience bullyingand discrimination in various forms (e.g. verbal, physical, sexual, online/electronic) in schoolsacross the nation. According to the 2019 Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network’s(GLSEN) National School Climate Survey, 86.3% of LGBTQ students expressed being harassedor assaulted (GLSEN, 2019, p. 4). Queer Theory allows us to think of new ways of solving theseissues that do not fall into the traditional means and solutions that prove to be ineffective. QueerTheory also allows us to be proactive in coming up with solutions for our youth.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):NUSD’s school handbook features their bullying policy and states that the district andschool will focus on the prevention of bullying through their school rules and conductexpectations. They provide the location of where students can find the school rules related tobullying (mainly in their handbook), encourage them to report bullying, and include a link toNUSD’s Report Bullying website (NUSD, 2021, p. 45). Pages 45-46 of the handbook discusssexual harassment, types of conduct that classify as harassment, and their policy onnon-discrimination with the inclusion of the policy number BP5145.3 (NUSD, 2021, pp. 45-6).NUSD devotes two pages towards their bullying, harassment, and non-discrimination policiesand resources in their district handbook (NUSD, 2021, pp. 45-6).37On NUSD’s website, I searched for the term “bullying” and then reviewed the results thatcame up that were applicable to the protocol. NUSD’s website includes a link to their bullyingprevention newsletters, which are released monthly. The search function also leads to a link toNUSD’s Bullying Prevention Manual, which gives more in-depth information on what bullyingis, the different types of bullying, their policies, the necessary procedures, and resources forfamilies and students, and the final search item that appears also gives access to a Bullying FAQpage.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):SCUSD’s district handbook features five pages on their anti-bullying andnondiscrimination policies. Page 3 of the handbook gives information on the district’snondiscrimination policy and defines bullying (what is required by the state to convey) (SCUSD,2021, p. 3). The nondiscrimination policy on page 3 also includes contact information to the TitleIX Coordinator which includes the contact information (phone number and email address) andaddress of the Coordinator (SCUSD, 2021, p. 3). SCUSD’s page 18 features the definition ofbullying, the school’s promise to provide a non-discriminatory learning environment, andmentions the obligation to report bullying (SCUSD, 2021, p.18).

A final link that appears is information to the district’snon-discrimination page, which discusses the equity complaince officer information, a space forfeedback submissions, and information for students and staff.Policies and Reporting Harassment/BullyingAs mentioned, Queer youth face many obstacles in their school climate with regards to bullyingand harassment. Having this information readily available would be incredibly beneficial toQueer youth. According to Gunckel (2009), “Queer Theory provides a framework for examiningschools, curriculum, and pedagogy to find those identities, bodies, and experiences that havebeen silenced, ignored, and rendered invisible” (p. 65). Utilizing Queer Theory as the theoreticalframework allows us to rectify the silencing of Queer youth by establishing policies thatencompass them and their needs and assists us in establishing better or easily-accessible ways inwhich Queer youth can report harassment or bullying to their administration.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In the NUSD handbook, on page 45, they cite board policy 5131.2 which reports that theschool shall focus on the prevention of bullying through their school rules which will be stated intheir handbook and other means (NUSD, 2021, p.45). Students are encouraged to report bullyingto school staff and can report bullying anonymously through their Report Bullying webpage.When you search for “harassment” on the NUSD website, you are linked to theirnondiscrimination/harassment policy information with the links to the district’s policies and aPDF with instructions on how to report bullying.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In the SCUSD handbook, page 3 touches on the nondiscrimination policy (the legalterminology of not allowing discrimination, harassment, or initmidation based on ancestry, color,40disability, race, gender…) (SCUSD, 2021, p. 3).

The handbook also features a section on page 51 thatdiscusses cyberbullying, harassment, and discriminatory attacks with regards to internet-basedattacks (TRUSD, 2021, p. 51).When you search for  “report harassment,” you are taken to their web page fordiscrimination and harassment which discusses the definition of harassment, how to file acomplaint, the proper form to use, and board policy information. You are also directed to theirDiscrimination of Harassment in Employment page for employees or applicants filing acomplaint. The TRUSD search function also resulted in a Complaint and Inquiries page thatdiscusses bullying, forms, the descriptions of each form of bullying and of the complaints, whereyou can file, a link to an organization chart, and a work flow chart. The search also resulted in alink to the Gender Equity/Title IX page and to their general parent concerns and forms pagewhich discusses bullying, discrmination, harassment, personal injury with direct links to thepages for each of these items.41Procedures for Reporting Staff/Teachers for Discrimination/HarassmentAs harassment and discrimination are prevalent obstacles that Queer youth face, students shouldhave access to information on how to report staff or teachers in their schools for discriminationand harassment they may face in the classroom. Michael Warner (1991) coined the termheteronormativity, which is the assumption that heterosexuality is the standard and is the norm.This deficit manner of thinking is, unfortunately, prevalent in many educators and in manyadministrations but the process for reporting them is not always clear.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In the NUSD handbook, there is a section that discusses a pathway to successfulcommunication (NUSD, 2021, p. 25). The handbook states that students can address the matterdirectly with a site staff member, they can then contact a school administrator if unresolved, andthen proceed to an informal and formal complaint through Constituent and Customer Services.The handbook also directs students to make anonymous complaints online via the districtwebsite.For the NUSD website, I utilized the search feature to search for the word “harassment”and came across a link to their nondiscrimination/harassment/and Title IX information. Whenyou search for “reporting,” you come across the link to their Bullying FAQ page. Theinformation on the page was taken from the California Department of Education “Bullying atSchool” PDF which is included as a link on the webpage (Counseling and Student SupportOffice, California Department of Education, 2003).Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In the SCUSD handbook, page 36 lists the complaint procedure and states that allcomplaints must be filed with a site administrator.

Queer Theory aims to disrupt the norm so Queer Theoryallows us the means to disrupt this system where suicide rates are incredibly high amongstteenagers and establish or provide better, more accessible suicide prevention resources to allyouth.43Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):The NUSD handbook features a page on community resources (p. 25) with organizationnames and websites (e.g. La Familia Counseling Services, California Youth Crisis Line) butthese resources do not include any that are specific to LGBTQIA+ youth (NUSD, 2021, p. 25).On the NUSD website, when you search for “suicide,” you are linked to the district’s “SuicidePrevention Month Resources” page from September 2020. This page features a link to the actualtraining, a link to a Spanish training, handouts that were part of the training, a link to contact theappropriate school psychologist, a referral form link, and a PDF toolkit.

The suicide resource featured is a link to the National SuicidePrevention Lifeline alongside otheir 1-800 phone number.AnxietyAccording to GLSEN’s 2019 School Climate Survey, a negative or hostile schoolenvironment negatively impacts a student’s mental health and those that experience victimizationand discrimination have a “poorer psychological well-being” (GLSEN, 2019, p. 6). The norm formany LGBTQIA+ youth, or for those youths perceived as Queer, is to attend school with a fearof harassment and assault, a fear of enclosed spaces where violence often occurs and is hiddenfrom others, and even being in an academic space where their safety may be ignored by their45school administration. Fear is a major factor in anxiety and a student’s fear of the unknown canlead to an increase or inability to manage anxiety.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In NUSD’s handbook, on page 25, there is one reference to community resources thatincludes counseling services. This school district’s handbook does not specifically addressanxiety and we can only make the assumption that the counseling services can address anxiety oranxiety management for its students. (NUSD, 2021, p. 25).On NUSD’s website, when you search for “anxiety,” you receive event information for aworkshop that was held in October 2021 for anxiety but includes no resources or recordings fromthe workshop. NUSD’s website does include a link to their mental health resources page whichfeatures various mental health resources for many conditions and does feature a section foranxiety. The anxiety section includes two links - one to the CDC’s website on anxiety/anxietymanagement and the second to an article from the National Association of School Psychologists(NASP) on information for parents on anxiety and anxiety disorders. The NUSD website alsoincludes a social emotional enrichment resource, as part of their social emotional learning, whichis a PDF workbook targeted towards teens in grades 6-8 (Schlab, 2008).Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In SCUSD’s district handbook, there are two pages which reference a student’s mentalhealth but nothing specific to anxiety/anxiety management. Page 6 includes the school district’sstudent support and health services which includes a paragraph regarding their health servicesstaff, the health service’s office, and includes their phone number (SCUSD, 2021, p. 6). Page 7includes a paragraph on the district’s Connect Center, a centralized support center for criticalsupport services, which includes information on the center, the services they offer (information46and referral, case management/service coordination, individual and family counseling referrals,and crisis assessment/crisis response), and the address of the Connect Center, as well as theirdirect office contact, phone number, and website. (SCUSD, 2021, p. 7)When you search for “anxiety” on the district’s website, you find a link to the studentsupport center which includes information on coping with stress and anxiety after tragedies. Thiswas the school’s response to the tragic shooting that occurred in 2019 at Saugus High School.This page includes a link to the Student Support Center webpage where you can see the servicesthat are provided and the history of the center. The district website also leads to a page whereyou learn about resources that help students cope with stress and anxiety, many of them beingcommunity resources.Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):The TRUSD handbook features one page on mental health resources. Page 27 features asmall section on the available regional Sacramento-area social services. This section instructsfamilies to dial 211 to connect with mental health services and the section instructs families tovisit the TRUSD website to look up available parent resources. (TRUSD, 2021, p. 27). There areno resources specific to anxiety.When searching for “anxiety” on the TRUSD website, you are directed to their upcomingworkshops. On this same webpage, there is a previous trainings section that features a “reducingstress and anxiety” workshop that includes the recording of the training, the presentation,handouts, and table of resources discussed during the training (many are community resources).The search function also leads you to the “Mental Health Resource Links for Parents & Families''page on the district website.

The second link directs users to the “Coping with Stress'' CDC webpage with tips onmanaging stress and the potential effects of doing so.Changes to CurriculumAn important factor to improving the climate for Queer youth is a change towardsinclusive curriculum. An inclusive curriculum allows Queer youth to enage in their studies dueto representation, equal treatment, and acceptance. This protocol was included to see if thedistrict handbooks and web pages include information on how they’re working towards a moreinclusive curriculum, any information on how often the curriculum is updated, or if curriculumsuggestions are open from the outside community. To create inclusive curriculum, we canintegrate tenets of Queer Theory to ensure that we are encompassing materials and topics that areactively going against the gender binary and heterosexism.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):The NUSD handbook features no reference to their curriculum practices with regards tothe protocols I was searching for. When searching the NUSD website for “curriculum” or“curriculum changes,” no results appeared that were specific to curriculum changes.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):The SCUSD handbook features two pages which mention their curriculum. On page 30,the handbook discusses curriculum and instruction materials and discusses the family’s right toreview the instructional materials and the right to discuss the curriculum in the student’s course.While this familial right seems to be helpful to LGBTQIA+ youth, it is often used againstLGBTQIA+ curriculum and topics in schools. On page 31, the handbook includes informationon Education Codes § 49091.14 and § 49063 which mention that the curriculum of every course48shall be compiled at least annually in a prospectus and is available for review upon request.(SCUSD, 2021, p. 31). When you search SCUSD’s website for “curriculum” or “curriculumchanges,” there are no results.Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):The TRUSD handbook includes one section on a page that discusses their curriculum.This page includes information from Education Codes § 49091.14 and § 49063 which discusseshow the curriculum is compiled at least once annually and that the findings are available uponrequest. (TRUSD, 2021, p. 20).When searching for “curriculum” on the TRUSD website, you are directed to the“Curriculum and Instruction” webpage which discusses their vision, mission, and standards ofexcellence. This webpage includes contact information for the staff, phone numbers, directextensions, and the address of the district office and also includes current high school courseofferings, testing from home protocols, the curriculum frameworks, and the course options andplacement policies for grades 7-12 mathematics. You can also find links for the CaliforniaHealthy Youth Act FAQs (with regards to comprehensive sexual health education), the FAIR ActFAQ (Fair, Accurate, Inclusive, and Respectful Education Act) and Education Code Section600400 about adopting instructional materials that “accurately portray the cultural and racialdiversity of our society” (TRUSD, n.d.). The FAIR Act is an act that has been used to call for amore inclusive curriculum with regards to incorporating LGBTQIA+ history, culture, and people.Resources on DepressionDepression is a major mental health factor that affects many Queer youth. GLSEN’s 2019National School Climate Survey reports that a hostile school climate is a cause for higher levelsof depression in LGBTQIA+ youth in high schools (GLSEN, 2019, p. 4). In the district49handbooks, I looked for depression resources such as tips, referrals to community organizationsor a mention of referral to school counselors or school psychologists/psychiatrists.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In NUSD’s handbook, there is one page that discusses community resources. Page 25 ofthe NUSD handbook discusses different community resources (e.g. groups, companies)  thatprovide services or have covered services in the Sacramento area (e.g. La Familia CounselingCenter, WEAVE, CA Youth Crisis Line) but does not specifically mention depression. There isalso a referral to the district website for a complete list of community resources (NUSD, 2021, p.25).On the NUSD website, when you search for “depression,” you are shown various websitelinks. The first is for workshop information from October 2021 but does not include meetingmaterials or recordings. A second relevant link is to their Mental Health Resources Page whichincludes a section on depression. This section includes two links from the National Associationof School Psychologists: one to a PDF for depression in children and adolescents geared towardsparents and educators that lists what depression is, the prevalence and risk factors, signs andsymptoms, evaluation and treatment, and what schools and adults can do. The second link is to aPDF for a depression handout for the home which discusses what depression is, what to considerwhen selecting interventions and support, recommendations, and recommended resources. Thelast relevant link in the search is for their Social Emotional Enrichment Resources page(connected to their Social Emotional Learning page) which features a “Dealing with Depression”68-page workbook for grades 6-8 from the Centre for Applied Research in Mental Health andAddiction and the British Columbia Ministry of Children and Family Development. (Bilkser etal., 2005).50Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):The search results for SCUSD’s handbook are the same as the anxiety resource results. InSCUSD’s district handbook, there are two pages which reference a student’s mental health butnot specific to depression/depression management. Page 6 includes the school district’s studentsupport and health services which includes a paragraph regarding their health services staff, thehealth service’s office, and includes their phone number (SCUSD, 2021, p. 6). Page 7 includes aparagraph on the district’s Connect Center, a centralized support center for critical supportservices, which includes information on the center, the services they offer (information andreferral, case management/service coordination, individual and family counseling referrals, andcrisis assessment/crisis response), and the address of the Connect Center, as well as their directoffice contact, phone number, and website. (SCUSD, 2021, p. 7)When you search the SCUSD’s webpage for the word “depression,” there are no relevantresults that appear.Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):The TRUSD handbook yielded the same results as the anxiety resource search - noresources specific to depression are listed. The TRUSD handbook features one page on mentalhealth resources. Page 27 features a small section on the available regional Sacramento-areasocial services. This section instructs families to dial 211 to connect with mental health servicesand the section instructs families to visit the TRUSD website to look up available parentresources. (TRUSD, 2021, p. 27)When you search the district website for “depression,” you are directed to theirEmergency Numbers web page which lists phone numbers and web pages for resources such asthe Suicide Prevention Crisis Line, the Trevor Project, the CA Youth Crisis Line, HOPE and51Crisis texting lines, CPS,  phone application suggestions (calm, headspace), and information forthe CA Parent and Youth Helpline. The Trevor Project is a resource specific to LGBTQIA+persons.Extra-Curricular EngagementLGBTQIA+ youth may utilize extracurricular activities as a form of  activism to combatdiscrimination, heterosexism, and homophobia present in their schools and communities. For thisprotocol, I searched for any mentions of extracurricular activities and whether the districthandbooks and websites are recommending off-campus organizations and resources, and anymentions of activities or organizations from their school districts.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In NUSD’s handbook, there is one mention of extracurricular engagement. On page 11,the handbook discusses staff responsibilities for those in the counseling office and there is onemention that states that staff are a system of support for extracurricular activities. (NUSD, 2021,p. 11).On NUSD’s website, when you search for “extracurricular activities,” no results appear.When you search for “extracurricular,” this leads to an FAQ page for Extracurriculars andAthletics which discusses information such as student athletes, when games/competitions begin,and health screening information. When you search for “GSA,” “Gay Straight Alliance,” and“Gender Sexuality Alliance” on the district website, there were no results.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In SCUSD’s district handbook, there is one page which mentions extracurricularactivities. On page 19, there is the mention that extracurricular club participation is available as asupport at all schools. (SCUSD, 2021, p.19).52On the SCUSD website, when you search for “extracurricular activities,” there are noresults. When you search for “extracurricular,” there are no results that appear. When you searchfor “GSA” on the district website, you are directed to the LGBTQ Support Services page whichfeatures the crisis lines, resources, national resources, LGBTQ task force, and fact sheets for AB1266. When you search for “Gay Straight Alliance,” you are directed to a page for LGBT relatedlinks (LGBT 9 Keys to Inclusive Clubs, Know Your Rights, Making Schools Safe, Youth ofColor, and Legal Issues in Schools). The page also has a link to the LGBTQ Support Servicespage.Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):In the TRUSD handbook, there is one page which mentions extracurricular activities. Onpage 11, the handbook states that they value and recognize the importance of extracurricularactivities as they enrich student development and that they support and encourage studentparticipation and go on to list the student requirements to participate in extracurricular activities(e.g. good behavior, the mention of GPA requirements for certain activities, student expectationsof conduct) (TRUSD, 2021, p. 11).On the TRUSD website, when you search for “extracurricular,” a link to the Title IXwebsite appears which gives information about the right to be provided with an equitableopportunity to participate in all academic extracurricular activities. A link to their CA Career andTech Student Organizations also appears. This page explores the three different career andtechnical student organizations (Family Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA),Future Farmworkers of America (FFA), and SkillsUSA) that function as extracurricular groupsin Career Technical Education pathways. When you search for “extracurricular activities,” youare directed to two links: one for a middle school activities page and one for high school53activities which discuss different events (some hosted by clubs) on various of their campuses.When  you search for “GSA,” “Gay Straight Alliance,” and “Gender Sexuality Alliance” on thedistrict website, no results appear.Dress CodesSchools should equally enforce dress codes for all youth as clothing can be a form ofself-expression (including gender identity and expression) that students use to empowerthemselves. Sections 200-220 of the education code protect students from “different kinds of biasand discrimination, including harassment based on actual or perceived sexual orientation, genderidentity, or gender expression” (American Civil Liberties Union of California, 2013) while alsoprohibiting discrimination based on gender identity or expression which includes respectingone’s pronouns and allowing one to dress as it relates to their gender identity (American CivilLiberties Union of California, 2013). For this protocol, I searched for any mentions of the schooldress code and any mentions of school districts equally enforcing the dress code and any mentionof whether they are abiding by the state laws regarding freedom of expression.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):NUSD’s handbook contains one page which discusses the school dress code anddiscusses the regulations with regards to clothing. The handbook mentions the concealment ofundergarments, denotes skirt/short length, the sagging pants policy, non-permissible clothingsuch as those that promote drugs, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, clothing that is sexuallysuggestive or racially-offensive, and clothing that promotes violence, group intimidation, organg/cult/satanic affiliation (NUSD, 2021, p. 38). On the NUSD website, if you search for “dresscode,” “dress,” or “attire,” no relevant results appear.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):54In the SCUSD handbook, there are no mentions of their district’s dress code, attire, orclothing policies.On the SCUSD website, when you search for “dress code,” “dress,” or “attire,” norelevant results appear on the default “site” section. If you toggle and search for content, youthen find a link to the “5000 Series - Students.” This link then leads you to a blank website witha column of “related links” on the side for board policies listed from 5000-5149 (SCUSD, n.d.).You can then search for “dress” on the webpage and two dress and grooming sites appear (BP5132 (Board Policy) and AR 5132 (Administrative Regulation) (SCUSD, n.d.). The site for BP5132 leads to a PDF revised document from 2002 that describes dress and grooming standards,listed codes that the district is following (dress and grooming, freedom of speech/expression,gang-related apparel, the comprehensive safety plan), and uniforms (SCUSD, n.d.). The secondlink to the AR 5132 PDF is the district’s administrative regulations document revised in 2002with regards to dress and grooming. This document discusses that the school principal is the oneto establish the school rules governing dress and grooming and a listing of school plans andeducation codes that schools must follow (e.g. allowing sun-protective clothing, shoesrequirements, free of crude, vulgar, profane, or sexually suggestive clothing, the concealment ofundergarments, hair requirements) and then goes on to discuss gang-related apparel and uniforms(SCUSD, n.d.)Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):TRUSD’s handbook features one page that discusses dress codes. Page 39 starts off bystating that each individual school decides on their own dress code and that students mustconform to the dress code policy of their school (TRUSD, 2021, p. 39). The section goes on todescribe the basic requirements expected at all sites. These requirements state that students are55expected to dress appropriately for the education environment and that clothing should notinterfere or disrupt the education environment, unless it's protected under freedom of speechlaws. This policy also mentions that accessories or clothing with language or images that arevulgar, sexually suggesstive, discriminatory, obscene, libelous, or that promote illegal or violentcontent are prohibited. This policy then goes on to describe clothing expectations such as fit,neat, clean, decent, and that sun protective clothing is permissible. Education Code 35183.5 isreferenced (TRUSD, 2021, p. 39). On the TRUSD website, when you search for “dress code,”“dress,” or “attire,” no relevant results appear.Gender-Neutral BathroomsAccording to GLEN’s 2019 National School Climate Survey, 59.1% of LGBTQIA+students reported that they personally experienced LGBTQ+-related discriminatory policies andpractices at school which included students being prevented from using the bathrooms matchingtheir gender identity (GLSEN, 2019, p. 6). Queer Theory allows us the means to actively fightagainst discrimination and against the gender binary and facilities that are not encompassing ofall youth. Analyzing the district handbooks and websites for mentions of gender-neutralbathrooms/restrooms is an important factor to research to analyze whether students are beinginformed of important access to campus resources.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):The NUSD handbook contains a matrix (page 35) about behavior expectations inbathrooms but does not mention an inclusion of gender-neutral bathrooms (NUSD, 2021, p. 35).The expectations in the restroom include doing your business and getting out, washing yourhands, keeping water in the sink, reporting unsanitary conditions, keeping the bathrooms clean,56returning to class promptly, flushing toilets, using bathrooms before and after class, cleaning upafter yourself, using appropriate language, and respecting others’ privacy (NUSD, 2021, p. 35).On the NUSD website, when you search for “gender neutral,” no results appear. Whenyou search for “bathrooms,'' no relevant results appear. The only link is the “Maintenance andOperations” web page with information on facility use, custodial services, and ground keeping.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In the SCUSD handbook, on page 36, there is a mention of sexual and gendernon-discrimination which states that under limited circumstances, arrangements may be made forstudents according to gender, such as separate locker room facilities, in accordance with federallaw (SCUSD, 2021, p. 36).On the SCUSD website, when you search for “gender neutral,” a link to the LGBTQSupport Services site appears which includes resource information, information on the LGBTTask Force, and a link to the AB 1266 Fact Sheet. The AB 1266 Fact Sheet also appears in thesearch results. This Fact Sheet is about AB1266, the School Success and Opportunity Act, thatwent into effect in 2014 to clarify the roles of school staff in working with students of allgenders, and clarifies that students’ access to educational resources shall correspond to thestudent’s gender identity (Sacramento City Unified School District, n.d.) This Fact Sheet doesmention restroom facilities and that students have the right to use the facilities that align withtheir gender identity. SCUSD includes in their recommendations that sites provide access to aprivate area in the public area (i.e. a nearby restroom stall with a door, an area separated by acurtain, a P.E. instructor’s office in the locker room, or a nearby gender neutral restroom) if astudent feels they need additional privacy (Sacramento City Unified School District, n.d.)Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):57The TRUSD handbook has no mention of gender neutral bathrooms. When searching for“gender neutral,” “restroom,” or “bathroom” on their website, no results appear.Gender-Inclusive LanguageUtilizing gender-inclusive language ensures that all students are encompassed in theschool environment. An example per the Southern Poverty Law Center, schools should use“gender-inclusive language on all event communications, including invitations” and “eventorganizers [should be educated] about students’ First Amendement right to attend events with asame-sex date and to wear clothing of their choice” (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2013, p. 3).Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In the NUSD handbook, gender-inclusive language is not specifically mentioned. Thehandbook does mention a language policy but it mentions using appropriate language (i.e. novulgar or profane language) (NUSD, 2021, p. 46). On the NUSD website, when you search for“gender inclusive,” an event from 1/12 appears about LGBTQ+ Best Practices and Protections inPublic Education but no recording or handouts are uploaded.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In the SCUSD handbook, there are no mentions of gender-inclusive language. When yousearch for the term “gender inclusive” on the website, you are sent to the LGBT+ page whichincludes links to outside resources and rights specific to LGBTQ+ students.Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):There are no mentions of gender-inclusive language in the TRUSD handbook. When yousearch for the term “gender inclusive,” there are no search results.58Improvements to School ClimateImproving the school climate is an important goal because LGBTQIA+ youth encounterschools filled with harassment, bullying, and assault during their time in school.  Whenconsidering this protocol, I considered things such as what the school aims for, if any protectionsare listed in handbooks and websites, and any general improvements for the school climatelisted.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In the NUSD handbook, the school district claims that the vision for all NUSD students isto graduate and be college and career ready, productive, responsible, and engaged global citizens.The NUSD handbook also has information regarding the district being a Safe Haven school (aschool site that is welcoming regardless of immigration status) and having equal access to allstudents. The handbook features a Safety, Optimism, Achievement, and Respect portion whichtouches on having students feel they belong and are supported on campus (NUSD, 2021, p. 10),their responses to undesired behaviors being intervention-based and focusing on reteaching(NUSD, 2021, p. 34), and all students must sign a compact (NUSD, 2021, p. 56) that they mustabide by all of the rules listed on the form. When you search for “school climate” on the website,there are no results.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In the SCUSD handbook, there are no relevant sections which discuss improvements tothe school climate, any protections for students, nor the aims of the school. On the SCUSDwebsite, upon searching “school climate,” you are taken to a link to the School Climate andBullying Prevention web page with a link to a brochure with more information. The searchresults also show a 2021-2022 School Climate Survey that is open for completion.59Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):The TRUSD handbook does not feature any relevant sections. When you search for“school climate” on their website, you are directed to four relevant links. You are directed to aHealthy Kids Survey to complete and you’re able to see previous survey results. There is a linkto their Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports Page with the department contactinformation and with information about what they do. There is a link to a “Child and WelfareAttendance” page, which encourages a positive and engaging school climate while increasingattendance. There is also a link to a letter from 2019 about Safe Haven schools.Staff Connection, Involvement, and Purpose to High School Youth/School ClimateSchool personnel have an obligation to assist and improve the school climate forLGBTQIA+ youth. School counselors, staff, and psychiatrists are some of the positions thatwork with students on the ground on a daily basis. Various research states that school counselorsand school psychiatrists are in an “ideal position to address the issues” (Pollock, 2006, p. 33) forQueer youth. In this section, we explore the district handbooks and websites to see if there areany mentions of the staff’s purpose in the district mission.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In the NUSD handbook, staff are included in the school’s core belief. This core beliefstates that staff must be “committed, collaborative, caring, and exemplary” and are expected to“serve as role models for students,” and staff are to enforce board policies which include“prohibitions against bullying, cyberbullying, harassment of students...” (NUSD, 2021, p. 33).When you search the website for “staff climate,” “staff support,” “staff involvement,” there areno results that appear.60Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In the SCUSD handbook, pages 17-18 discuss the teacher and support staffresponsibilities (SCUSD, 2021, pp. 17-8). This includes topics such as appropriate behavior andattitudes, communication expectations, expectations to establish an environment where studentscan meet academic standards, and interacting with all parents and students with respect anddignity while providing quality customer service. When you search their district website for“staff involvement,” “staff purpose,” “staff climate,” and “staff support,” no results appear.Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):In the TRUSD handbook, there were no sections discussing staff involvement and theirrelation to the school climate. When you search for “staff involvement” on the district website,there are no relevant results. When you search for “staff support,” you are sent to the NewTeacher and Mentor Support page which features resources for new teachers (list of the supportteam, monthly newsletters, invitations) to assist new teachers in being effective educators in theirschools to contribute to a better school climate.Student Rights (e.g. right to privacy, freedom of expression, state laws)Students, school staff/administrators/, and families should all be aware of student rightsso that student voices and rights are respected while in school. These rights should be easilyaccessible to all in case of any misunderstandings.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In the NUSD district handbook, there is mention of a Civility Policy, Board Policy 1213,which states that students have the opportunity to voice their concerns about policies andpractices and to be involved in problem solving (NUSD, 2021, p. 24). The handbook does notexplicitly state student rights. On the NUSD website, when you search for “student rights,” there61are no results. When you search for “right to privacy,” you’re linked to the Board Policies andAdministrative Regulations page which lists all board policies.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):The SCUSD handbook lists a student’s rights to learn in a safe environment and todiscuss issues or concerns with any administrator, teacher, or personnel (SCUSD, 2021, p. 12).The SCUSD handbook also includes a section on pupil and family privacy and their rights toprivacy (SCUSD, 2021, p. 28). This section also includes information about a pupil’sparticipation in surveys and their rights with regards to surveys and their rights with relation topolitical affiliations/behavior/close family relationship surveys (SCUSD, 2021, p. 28). Page 29discusses a pupil’s records and privacy rights granted to students that fall under certainclassifications (SCUSD, 2021, p. 29). On the SCUSD website, when you search for “studentrights,” you are linked to the student handbook and to a webpage for “Students Rights underTitle IX.”Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):In the TRUSD handbook, there are no mentions of student rights (e.g. right to privacy,freedom of expression, etc). On the TRUSD website, when you search for “student rights,” youare taken to the student handbook and linked to the Student Services page which has informationon work permits, discipline guidelines, and immunization and healthcare links.Support/Assistance/Guidance with Paperwork that Incorrectly Lists Student GenderOffering assistance and guidance with regards to paperwork that incorrectly lists theirgender for those students that are gender non-conforming, transgender, and intersex ensures thatstaff and peers address them using their preferred pronouns (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2013,p. 3). Queer Theory actively works to disrupt the norms of current, biased systems and by62utilizing Queer Theory we can  advocate to provide better support and assistance to youth thatface difficulty with having their preferred gender and name recognized.Natomas Unified School District (NUSD):In the NUSD handbook, there isn’t a specific mention with regards to assistance given tothose that are misgendered in their school. Through the NUSD website, when you search for“gender,” you are taken to the registration page for the LGBTQ+ Best Practices and ProtectionsWorkshop which occured on December 9, 2021. The page contains no links, no materials, and norecording to access. When you search for “gender expression,” there are no results.Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD):In the SCUSD handbook, on page 7, there is a section discussing LGBTQ SupportServices. This section gives LGBTQ+ students and families with contact information andwebsite information for support with counseling services, gender update form, and advocacy(SCUSD, 2021, p. 7). On the SCUSD website, when you search for “paperwork gender,”“gender,” and “gender expression,” you are taken to a link to the AB 1266 Fact Sheet. This pagegives a brief overview and allows the download of the fact sheet which discusses terms,summaries of the rights, and FAQs. You are also provided links to the non-discrimination policyand Title IX coordinator and there is also the inclusion of the LGBTQ Support Services website(local resources, crisis lines, brochures, and a link to the AB 1266 Fact Sheet) which is a pagegeared specifically towards LGBTQIA+ youth.Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD):In the TRUSD handbook, there are no mentions of assistance being provided to studentsmaking changes to gender on documentation. On the TRUSD website, when you search for“paperwork gender,” you are taken to the Title IX/Gender Equity page. You are also provided63links to the Parent Resources, Bullying, and 504 accommodations (i.e. student rights to havetheir name and gender respected by the school). TRUSD also provides a Safe Space Kit fromGLSEN on the webpage and a “Schools in Transition” Handbook from the ACLU (GLSEN,2016). GLSEN is the Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network - an LGBTQIA+ specificorganization and their Safe Space Kit is geared specifically towards Queer youth (GLSEN,2016).Concluding ThoughtsThis work is based on the critical analysis of three Sacramento-area school districts’handbooks and websites. There were fifteen different factors analyzed that used a protocol todetermine the support of Queer youth from these school districts based on the materials that wereexamined. The following chapter will discuss the findings and recommendations based on theanalysis that was conducted and discussed in this chapter.64CHAPTER IVCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSConclusions and Recommendations\"All young people, regardless of sexual orientation or identity, deserve a safe and supportiveenvironment in which to achieve their full potential.\" - Harvey MilkIn this critical document analysis of three Sacramento-area school district handbooks andwebsites, I analyzed these documents to see how they serve LGBTQIA+ youth. The fifteen (15)factors that were used to examine these documents are all essential elements to uncovering thegaps in support for Queer high school youth. Discovering these gaps helps us improve supportfor LGBTQIA+ youth. The results indicated that all three school districts are providing someessential information in their handbooks and in their district websites for supporting Queeryouth. There is still much work to be done to provide Queer youth with the support and servicesthat they need to navigate the educational system while facing these challenges, while alsopotentially growing their activism in and outside of school to improve the school climate.Anti-Bullying/Anti-Harassment/Anti-Discrimination Resources and ReportingAll three school districts are providing enough coverage to provide basic resources forQueer youth and their families on anti-bullying/discrimination topics in their handbooks andwebsites.  These resources also include information on reporting bullying. The handbooksinclude a couple of pages on this topic and NUSD and SCUSD provide online reporting sites forbullying while TRUSD provides an online platform for complaints. These school districts arestreamlining reporting through their online platforms and are making this process accessible tothose with an internet connection.  Their processes allow this reporting to be anonymous for65those who fear retaliation while still also providing the option to report issues to an administratoror in paper form. Ensuring that the process to report bullying is accessible to everyone isessential to providing a safe space for Queer youth and is a legal right that Queer youth have perthe ACLU.When searching for resources or for more information on bullying, discrimination, orharassment, the TRUSD website features a multitude of resources. They include a discriminationand harassment webpage with definitions, steps on how to report, information on the properforms to utilize when filing official complaints, and the board policies that cover these topics.The website also guides you to their “Complaints and Inquiries” page which focuses on bullying,the types of bullying, where to file a complaint, the appropriate forms to utilize, and a workflowchart. The district website also leads to their “Gender Equity and Title IX” page which featuresinformation and student rights with regards to Title IX and equal opportunity for everyoneregardless of their sex/gender identity. While TRUSD features a lot of information on theirwebsite, they do not include much information with regards to bullying, harassment, ordiscrimination in their district handbook. They only include small sections that discuss sexualharassment and cyberbulling/online harassment. Including information on bullying, harassment,and discrimination in both the handbook and the district website ensures that this information isaccessible to students and their families, who may not be technologically savvy. If schooldistricts refuse to include extensive bullying, harassment, or discrimination sections in thehandbook, they should make reference to the websites they have available to address these topicsto avoid families and students assuming there are none.66Mental Health ResourcesWith regards to resources that focus on anxiety and anxiety management, none of theschool districts feature information in their handbooks which are specific to this topic. While thehandbooks do not feature any specific resources, all school district websites feature somespecific resource on anxiety and stress management ranging from workbooks to CDC websiteswith additional information.As with anxiety and anxiety management, the three school district handbooks do notspecifically mention depression or depression resources. Two school districts (NUSD andTRUSD) feature various materials for depression and depression management on their website.TRUSD makes a specific reference to The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ organization that focuseson suicide prevention and crisis intervention, as a resource. SCUSD had no results on theirwebsite which means that they have no resources in either their handbook or on their website.With regards to suicide prevention, one school district (NUSD) focuses on communityresources in their handbook while the other two (SCUSD, TRUSD) include either acomprehensive suicide prevention plan (TRUSD) or other various resources on their website(SCUSD). NUSD does feature an online recorded training with handouts for families to watchand a PDF Toolkit. Providing accessible information to mental health resources is crucial for allstudents, especially during their time in high school. According to the World Health Organization(WHO), suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds (WHO, 2021) andLGBTQIA+ youth are at significantly increase risk due to mistreatment and stigmatization(Trevor Project, 2021). Per The Trevor Project, “Queer youth are more than four times as likelyto attempt suicide than their peers” and 42% of Queer youth “seriously considered attemptingsuicide” (The Trevor Project, 2021). Teenagers rely on their schools to provide them with these67resources and when schools are lacking this information, it negatively affects all students. PerGLSEN (2019), “students who feel safe and supported at school have better educationaloutcomes” and “LGBTQ students who have LGBTQ-related school resources report betterschool experiences and academic success” (p. 8). Providing these resources is a must for schoolsand school districts to provide adequate mental health resources to their students, especially nowduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students did not have the sufficient resources while theywere at sheltering in place and are in need of additional support to navigate not only their schoollives but their personal lives as well. During the lockdown, youth lost access to their friends,their support systems, and extracurricular activities. This loss was felt by Queer youth becausesocial distancing and a lack of social interactions negatively impacted Queer youth because theylost access to the people that supported them, they lost extracurricular activities that made themhappy, they had to reimagine their friendships to not be based on physical proximity, and theyhad an increase in negative interactions with those at home if families are unsupportive of them(The Trevor Project, 2020). Youth also had an increase in negative social interactions if theirfamilies were not accepting.Campus InclusivityEnsuring that students feel included and part of the school community aligns with variousschool districts’ missions to create an inclusive environment for their students. Creating aninclusive environment for all students is crucial in ensuring they feel accepted, comfortable, andable to thrive amongst their peers and their administration. With regards to inclusive campusfacilities such as gender neutral restrooms, SCUSD’s handbook is the only handbook and websitethat specifically mentions information on accommodations to lockers and restrooms based ongender. SCUSD’s handbook mentions AB1266, which allows “transgender students to fully68participate in activities, facilities, and programs based on their gender identity” (GLSEN, n.d.)and the right to use the restroom that aligns with their gender identity, and allows schools toprovide additional private areas in open locker rooms/restrooms for extra privacy (SCUSD,2021). NUSD mentions that when utilizing spaces such as bathrooms and locker rooms, studentsshould respect others’ privacy and TRUSD features no mentions of gender neutral restrooms intheir handbooks or on their district website. The inclusion of gender neutral restrooms in districthandbooks and websites is crucial for Queer youth. Bathrooms are a space where manyLGBTQIA+ youth do not feel physically or emotionally safe or comfortable entering due to itbeing an enclosed space where bullying and harassment can occur.With regards to utilizing or enforcing gender inclusive language (for example,they/them/their versus he/she/hers/his), none of the three school districts specifically mentionedusing inclusive verbiage in their handbooks nor on their websites but do use consistent genderinclusive language throughout their handbooks. Regarding regulations based on dress, none ofthe three school districts mention the right of students wearing clothing that aligns with theirgender identity. NUSD and TRUSD make no mention of dress codes on their website and givebasic guidelines in their handbooks and SCUSD has no mention of dress codes in their handbookbut discusses dress and grooming on their website. If school districts are attempting to beinclusive to all students, they should include sections on their websites and handbooks thatdiscuss an attempt at enforcing and including gender inclusive language throughout their schooldistricts to ensure an inclusive environment for all students. The lack of verbiage regarding astudent’s rights to wear clothing that aligns with their gender identity is also not includinginformation with regards to a student right. Queer youth should know that schools cannot punishthem for choosing to wear clothing that expresses their chosen gender, as long as it adheres to69other school/district requirements, and they should have the right to challenge regulations madethat go against their rights.School ClimateExtra-curricular engagements and activities and staff connection and purpose cometogether to contribute to the school climate. Two school district handbooks (SCUSD andTRUSD) mention extracurricular activities and how they are available at all schools but do notspecifically mention Gay Straight Alliances (GSA). When searching the district websites, twoschool districts have no results when you search for GSAs. SCUSD features various informationon their website with regards to Queer youth resources (LGBTQ Support Services Page,LGBTQIA+ related links to inclusive club resources). Many Queer youth utilize involvement inextracurricular activities as a form of activism. Including resources and information aboutinclusive clubs, or Queer specific clubs, such as GSAs, are invaluable to Queer youth to providethem with a space where they are accepted and where they can enact change.Staff involvement and their connection towards the school climate is an important part inincorporating staff and school personnel into having an essential part and being integrated intothe school climate. NUSD includes staff expectations in their handbook and has the purpose to“serve as role models for students,” to enforce board policies against bullying and harassment forexample, and includes staff in their core beliefs. SCUSD mentions teacher/staff responsibilitiesand expectations. TRUSD has no mention of staff involvement or expectations from staff/schoolpersonnel. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (2013), having inclusive leaders andallies that “promote a safe and inclusive environment are essential” (p. 2) because it creates “aculture in which other staff members are unafraid to be allies'' (p. 2). Including staff as70contributors to the school climate makes their involvement have purpose and allows staff andschool personnel the space to be allies to Queer youth.Student Rights and Expectations/SupportsSCUSD includes student rights in their handbook by including the right to a safeenvironment, having a right to discuss issues and concerns withadministrators/teachers/personnel, mentioning pupil/family privacy, and including a pupil’srights in surveys. NUSD and TRUSD do not explicitly state students’ rights in their handbooknor on their website. Having students, staff, school personnel, and families/guardians aware ofstudent rights benefits contributes knowledge and allows Queer youth and allies the opportunityto celebrate their rights as well as voice their objections against decisions that are against theirrights and ensures that all students are treated equally.TRUSD and SCUSD provide students with resources and assistance with regards tostudent gender and changing their school records. SCUSD includes information on their LGBTQsupport services resource and references their gender update form in their handbook.SCUSD also features information on their website and this includes an AB1266 fact sheet,reference to Title IX, and additional resources on their LGBTQ Support Services page, one ofthree school districts that feature a website specifically geared towards Queer youth. WhileTRUSD does not include anything in their handbook, they include various resources on theirwebsite. The TRUSD website includes information on their Title IX/Gender Equity page, aparent resources page which includes 504 accommodations (a student’s right to their preferredname/gender) and includes resources from GLSEN (a Space Kit) and from the ACLU (schools intransition). NUSD has no mention in their handbook nor in their website. Offering guidance withregards to documentation that incorrectly lists a student’s gender ensures that staff and peers71address them using their preferred pronouns (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2013, p. 3) andenables Queer youth to feel respected at their schools.Final ThoughtsWhen I first started this work, I was under the assumption that schools were completelyfailing in support Queer youth and didn’t have high expectations for what I would find whenconducting my document analysis. I have learned that while almost no school districts will haveevery resource available for Queer youth (issues will always arise and additional integration willalways be necessary), we are slowly evolving to include more and more resources for Queeryouth. Many school districts are already including valuable resources for LGBTQIA+ youth andcan continue to include more and more to fully support Queer youth and to provide an inclusiveenvironment for all students.It was noteworthy to see that one of the school districts features an LGBTQ+ SupportServices page on their district website. Incorporating a web page for Queer youth would be anessential integration in order to successfully support Queer youth. I was pleasantly surprised todiscover that a district website included information from GLSEN and from the ACLU that arespecific to Queer youth and building inclusiveness in student extracurriculars. GLSEN and theACLU are advocates for Queer youth and are great resources for LGBTQIA+ youth through boththe materials provided and through the work they do.It was surprising to discover that many of the mental health resources that districts areproviding or referencing are not listed in their school handbooks. The school handbook may bethe first resource that students go through to find assistance and we fail Queer youth when wedon’t include or generalize resources on anxiety, depression, or suicide. We cannot make theassumption that students will think of going to the district website if they do not locate what they72need from the handbook or the school website. It was disappointing to discover that not allschool districts feature information regarding gender neutral accommodations such as restroomsand locker rooms for students.While examining district handbooks and websites, I began to wonder whether changes tothese two items are enough. Students are no longer given physical copies of their districthandbooks - they are digitally given a copy. Digital copies are not accessible to all students andstudents forget about them after the first couple days of the semester. They may not rememberthat they have this resource available to them. If they don’t remember having this resource anddon’t know the type of information contained in these handbooks, do these resources helpstudents? Do all school personnel and school administrations know all of the policies andinformation contained in their district handbooks? Do they abide by every one? Do they knowthe resources listed on their district websites and handbooks? If these policies and resources areavailable but not being referenced or regulated, do they make a change?Our current school climate is in turmoil. More conservative states such as Texas andFlorida are passing legislature against Queer youth and Queer persons. Texas is banning genderaffirming care for trans youth and Florida is passing a “Don’t Say Gay” bill where classroomsare being banned from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity. Research demonstratesthat including more inclusive courses and topics positively affects Queer youth. Research provesthat allowing students to express themselves and their identity positively impacts them, theirschool atmosphere, and creates a sense of belonging. The work that these three Sacramentoschool districts have done is so important especially when compared to this legislation and theactions that are being taken. Schools should be providing support for all students regardless oftheir gender identity and expression.73REFERENCESAmerican Civil Liberties Union of California (2013).

    "abstract": "Queer youth face many obstacles and challenges, including unsafe conditions while in school and a lack of inclusive curriculum. Queer Theory, which disrupts and challenges the norms and heteronormativity of our current systematic, norm-based systems, helps us imagine what schools might look like if they support LGBTQIA+ youth.Using content analysis, I created my own protocols to analyze the handbooks and websites of three Sacramento area school districts. The findings indicated that all three school districts are providing some essential information in their handbooks and in their district websites for supporting Queer youth. There is still much work to be done to provide Queer youth with the support and services that they need to navigate the educational system",
