Running head: CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 1Identifying Cultural Biases and Understanding Health Care Disparities For LGTBQ+PatientsJevon NelsonDominican University of CaliforniaNURS 4500: Nursing ResearchDr. Patricia HarrisSpring 2022CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 2AbstractUnderstanding the health disparities within the LGBTQ+ population, will consist ofeducating Nurses and other healthcare providers cultural competence for this population, alongwith proposing certain educational training programs for all the medical professionals. There’snot only an implicit bias but also lack in quality of healthcare due to the personal reasons thathealthcare providers may have, along with certain stigmas that creates an infringement onhealthcare for this specific population. Members of the LGBTQ+ community will continue tohave one of the highest amounts of health care disparities due to the lack of culturalincompetence if nothing is done. This thesis is essential and will explore this topic and aims mainly to explain and assessthe relationship between the ever-growing population of LGBTQ+ patients and the healthcaredisparities they experience. The purpose of this proposed study is to determine the root cause ofthe lack of cultural competence and propose how education for nurses and other healthcareproviders can potentially significantly decrease the number of disparities. This thesis is alsoaimed to understand and propose future cultural awareness for the LGBTQ+ population.With conducting a mixed study literature review, primarily through qualitative andquantitative designs, researching articles that can investigate and explore the attitudes, health andknowledge, and experiences within the healthcare setting among the LGBTQ+ patients.  Otherresearch findings involve understanding the implicit bias among the stigmatization causing thisspecific population of patients to receive a lower standard of care contributing to their healthcaredisparities.CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 3Table of ContentsAbstract 2Introduction 4Problem Statement 4Purpose Statement 5Literature Review 5Understanding Implicit Bias, Stereotypes, And Stigmas 6Effects of Incompetent Cultural Care 8Increasing Cultural Competence 9Research Proposal 11Theoretical Framework 11Primary Research Aims 12Ethical Considerations 12Study Design 15Sample and Recruitment 15Ethical Considerations 15Methods 16Analysis 17Conclusion 17References 19CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 4IntroductionThroughout health care, there has been an enormous number of cultural communitiessuffering from the detrimental effects due to lack of cultural competence of providers, includingnurses. The LGBTQ+ community being one that has one of the highest rates of healthcaredisparities. Finding resources and opportunities to culturally educate healthcare providers haspotential to decrease the extent of healthcare disparities that are so prevalent within the LGBTQ+community. This topic is immensely relevant within healthcare at this moment in time becausethe LGTBQ+ is becoming more widely understood as a population. Healthcare professionalsshould become aware that the LGBTQ+ patients and identities are intersectional andmultilayered (Margolies, Brown, 2019).According to the article, “Increasing Cultural Competence With LGBTQ+ Patients,” in astudy of practicing nurses, most reported that they have no training in LGBTQ health (Margolies& Brown, 2019). The article goes on to discuss if nurses and healthcare professionals seem tolack basic education on LGTBQ healthcare, there may be a consequence of; negative attitudes,endorsed stereotypes, along with feeling uncomfortable providing care to LGTBQ+ patients. Iwould explain the issue that culturally incompetent health care warrants detrimental issuespertaining to LGBTQ+ patients. I would also explain studies on how discrimination to the genderand sexual minorities affect the quality of the care they receive and the types of healthcareresources they can access.CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 5Problem StatementThe lack of cultural competence with healthcare providers whether it’s; implicit biases,stereotypes, or generalized stigmas warrant the health care disparities for the LGBTQ+population.  The gay, lesbian, transgender, queer community presents a growing and underservedpopulation in the United States, and compared to non-LGBTQ+ heterosexuals, previous studieshave reported this specific population are still adversely affected and adversely marginalizedwithin healthcare (Quinn, Sutton & Matthew, 2015). The fear of disclosing their sexualorientation or gender, primarily based on the perceived discrimination constitutes barriers andultimately lack of care for these patients. That added sense of fear along with explicit rejectionomits the proper care and disease management with these specific patients. The healthcaresystem should educate nurses and all other healthcare professionals to understand the culture ofthe LGBTQ+ population which will elucidate the decrease in the amount of healthcare disparitiesincreases adequate care for all these patients.  The rates from this study go on to show how thehigh rates of orientation disclosure of LGBTQ status, enhanced greater acceptance fromproviders, along with the need for examination of hospital policies and improved culturalcompetency.Purpose StatementThe purpose of this paper is to understand and seemingly decrease the health caredisparities associated with healthcare providers lacking the cultural competence for LGBTQ+patients.Literature ReviewThe research studies that were reviewed focused primarily on the perceived emotions andqualitative responses that measure the effect of the lack of cultural competence with LGBTQ+CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 6patients. These articles were used to obtain throughout the library data resources such asPubMed, and a multitude of other databases. Main key terms used for article research wereLGBTQ+ competence, bias, healthcare disparities, and cultural competence. These terms allottedthe articles used throughout this research thesis and to support the purpose of the research. Thearticles are used to instill the necessary information for understanding the lack of culturalcompetence for the LGTBQ+ community along with understanding the stigmas associated withthe care provided for the specific population.The main themes that are involved within this research can divide into three topics. Thefirst topic would be the perceived emotions and affects from health care implicit bias, stereotypesand stigmas by nurses and healthcare providers. Another topic would be the resources that can beused to decrease the lack of cultural competence i.e., trainings, more theory education duringschooling for nurses and other healthcare providers. Lastly, reviewing and applying informationpertaining to the number of nurses and providers that can ultimately increase the culturalknowledge of the LGBTQ+ patients. Please see the Literature Review Table located after theReference List for a summary of the articles in this review.Understanding Implicit Bias, Stereotypes, And StigmasThese articles were chosen to help understand the implicit health care biases that nursesand other medical professionals may possess. To understand health disparities and inequities forLGBTQ+ patients, there’s a foundation that involves understanding the root cause. The articlesused to understand implicit bias are primarily based throughout qualitative and quantitativemethods.In the article “Increasing Cultural Competence with LGBTQ+ Patients' ' conducted thestudy to explain the issue that coincides with the lack of cultural competence with nurses andCULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 7other healthcare professionals (Magnolia, 2019). The study design was based on qualitativedesigns to measure the amount of quality in care these patients received once they chose tonon-disclosure on registrar forms. The sample population was primarily LGBTQ+ patients,including 544 participants with an Emergency Department. The main purpose of this study is toexplain, educate, and propose possible education for nurses and other healthcare providers todecrease the lack of competence that warrants the increased amount of healthcare disparities forthis population. The qualitative method shows that LGBTQ+ who chose to non-disclose theirsexual orientation create a more positive experience for the LGTBQ+ opposed to disclosing thatinformation, Nurses, and other healthcare providers subconsciously have implicit bias pertainingto this specific population which is based around the lack of cultural competence.According to the article, “Exploring the attitudes, knowledge and beliefs of Nurses andMidwives’ of The Healthcare Needs of the LGBTQ Population; An integrative Review”two-thirds of trans individuals had negative experiences with healthcare professionals which wasconsistent with healthcare, general care, and gender identity clinics.To gain an understanding on the lack of care in relation to cultural competence would be tounderstand the healthcare rates within the LGBTQ+ population. The LGBTQ+ communityexperiences higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, eating disorders, mental illness, andsuicide (Stewart, O’Reilly, 2017). All the psychiatric, and general health issues all fall in thehands of healthcare providers to manage with they trained and educated to be aware or, hence thelack of cultural competence. Nurse and other healthcare providers can have; queerphobia,implicit bias, inequity, and general ethical and health disparities to treat all the patients the same.In the article “Training to reduce LGBTQ-related bias among medical, nursing, anddental students and providers: a systematic review.” that incorporated 639 abstracts, includingCULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 8qualitative and pre- post intervention tests, basically involved understanding the implicit biasalong with stigmatization causing LGBTQ patients to receive a lower standard of care. Thesearch identified 639 articles identifying as a medical program, through a systematic review,researching the medical programs, nursing programs trying to reduce the implicit bias towardsthe LGBTQ+ patients (Morris, 2019). The effectiveness of intergroup cultural educationprimarily serves as a basis in understanding the prejudice for medical and nursing programs andreducing the implicit bias and prejudice in healthcare for those patients.Effects of Incompetent Cultural CareWith conducting research for the effects of the incompetent cultural care for LGBTQ+patients, two articles that explain the effects include “Differences in Healthcare Access, Use, andExperiences Within a Community Sample of Racially Diverse Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,Transgender, and Questioning Emerging Adult, and “Health Disparities by Sexual Orientation:Results and Implications from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.” They’re bothqualitative, cross sectional research studies which are primarily designed to understand thecorrelation between health disparities with LGBTQ+ relative to that of the cis-gender,heteronormative patients.The article “Differences in Healthcare Access, Use, and Experiences Within aCommunity Sample of Racially Diverse Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and QuestioningEmerging Adult” the research conducted was a longitudal study with primarily 206 participants,with the study design being a focus group on patient who identified as queer or were questioningidentity reported negative healthcare experiences more frequently than their LGBTQ+ identifiedpatients. The purpose of this study is to understand the numerous numbers of health disparitiesrelative to cisgender and heterosexual people (Macapagal, Bathia, Greene, 2016). The potentialCULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 9contributors are perceived and actual discrimination in healthcare settings related to their sexualorientation and gender identity hindering health-seeking behaviors or causing again the negativeexperience within healthcare.In the article “Health Disparities by Sexual Orientation: Results and Implications fromthe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System” a focus group survey response study whichincorporated 8290 participants starting from ages eighteen and older within the LGBTQ+community. The purpose of this study was examining the outcomes represented with the widespectrum of physical, functional, mental health along with health risk factors. Some of the resultsindicated that in comparison to their heterosexual counterparts, LGBTQ+ patient are moresusceptible to health disparities such as; an increase in cardiovascular disease, Cancer, Arthritis,Asthma, along with general poor health comes with healthcare.Increasing Cultural CompetenceTo elucidate the premise on the lack of care with LGBTQ+ patients, the articles used,explains how increasing education on this specific population showed a particular increase incultural competence. The articles researched within the topic of increasing cultural competenceinclude Training Healthcare Professionals in LGBTI cultural competencies: Exploratory findingfrom the Health4LGBTI pilot Project'' and “Improving LGBTQ Cultural Competence of RNsThrough Education.”In the article “Improving LGBTQ Cultural Competence of RNs Through Education '' thisstudy established an understanding of the knowledge and attitudes of RNS about LGBTQ peopleand the impact of an educational intervention (Traistan, 2020). Providing a vessel for educationand cultural competence, awareness, which would then ultimately evolve into cultural safety candecrease the health disparities of the LGBTQ+ population within healthcare. Research has foundCULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 10in years spanning from 2009-2017 only 0.19% of literature in the top 20 nursing journals focusedon sexual minority health (Traistan, 2020). But this research was conducted with the design ofdescriptive correlational study with cross sectional design and pre and posttest information. Thepopulation consisted of the convenience sample of 111 employed registered nurses in thePittsburgh Metropolitan region. The purpose of this study assessed the baseline knowledge andlevel of cultural competence with the impact of educational intervention. The result of this studyexplained how there’s effectiveness of an educational intervention on knowledge.Increasing cultural education on patients within the LGBTQ+ communities is a plan thatwill be the foundation to increasing the cultural awareness along with decrease in healthdisparities within this patient population.  According to the research article “Training HealthcareProfessionals in LGBTI cultural competencies: Exploratory finding from the Health4LGBTI pilotProject '' this training research study was done to decrease the health inequities of the LGBTQpatients, with the participation of 110 healthcare professionals. The main purpose of the studywas to assess the pre and posttest knowledge before and after the training to increase theknowledge behind the LGBTQ+ population. The participant attitude scores increased forinclusivity along with an increase in knowledge for this specific population's needs.Throughout the research articles that were used as a reference within the literature review,they all provided ample information to elucidate the implicit bias, stereotypes, along with howthe increase in knowledge allot for cultural competence with LGBTQ+ patients. It has beenfound that increasing cultural knowledge with nurses, nursing students, and other health careprofessionals can decrease the amount of health care disparities for patients within this specificpopulation. The general strengths within these various studies were that they were able to havean accurate statistical analysis in terms of analyzing the correlation between LGBTQ+ patientsCULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 11and their experience with implicit bias from health care professionals. Other strengths throughoutthese studies also indicates the number of negative experiences that are experienced from theentire span of sexual identity with LGTBQ+ patients. Some limitations within the study werethat they couldn’t effectively provide enough information throughout the studies for the mainpurpose of reliability on the patients being surveyed. The evidence provided really creates awider amplitude in the worthiness of guiding practice. Throughout the various sources ofresearch literature, they all aimed to understand and relay pertinent information that identifies theimplicit cultural biases and stigmas that patients within this specific population go through.Research ProposalThe overall proposal for further research would be to understand the correlation betweenmore LGBTQ+ patients and how the increase in cultural competence with nurses and health careproviders reduce the negative health outcomes and disparities for these patients. Some questionsthat arise would be to understand what implementations and curricula would result in morehealthcare providers being more culturally literate for this specific population of patients.The rationale behind my research proposal would be that nurses and other healthcareproviders are based on my original problem statement. Creating the culturally competent carewill influence LGBTQ+ patients to receive healthcare with a reduction of the negative trajectorywhen they are faced with implicit biases, stigmas, and discrimination. Understanding thecorrelation between the lack of cultural understanding and providing the education to aid inculturally competent care related to the literature reviewed pertaining to this research.Theoretical FrameworkTheoretical framework being used within this research proposal would be the nursingtheorists Madeleine Leinenger. She developed the “Transcultural Nursing Theory or CulturalCULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 12Care Theory” which involved knowing and understanding different cultures concerning nursingand health-illness caring practices, beliefs, and values to provide meaningful and efficaciousnursing care services to people's cultural values and health-illness context (Gonzalo, 2021). Herresearch serves as the preliminary basis for understanding and providing culturally competentcare for patients in order to uphold the efficacy of providing care for patients. The maincomponent of nursing is that nurses are educated on culture but in context with my literaturereview, the lack of cultural congruence or competence serves as a cause of disparities within thispopulation.Primary Research Aims● My primary research aims would be to create a questionnaire specifically for LGBTQ+patients that will study their qualitative responses throughout the survey.The specific population used to represent the population would again, LGBTQ+ patientswho can respond to their experiences with healthcare. My strategy for recruitment would bethrough use of social media, and a public questionnaire through Dominican University's studentpopulation who identifies as LGBTQ+.Ethical ConsiderationsSome ethical considerations would be to uphold the anonymity throughout the survey forthose who chose to disclose their sensual orientation but would like to remain anonymous. Thispopulation being the LGBTQ+ population is specifically vulnerable being that their sexuality cancreate and warrant for a multitude of socially unaccepted behaviors. The main trajectory of thisresearch is to understand the vulnerability that stems from the cultural incompetence and bias forpeople in this specific population. I would like to obtain consent for the questionnaire beforeproceeding on with the survey to ensure that the participants are aware of what they’re involvedCULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 13in the study. The consent process will simply involve a question prior to the start of thequestionnaire which will ensure that the participants consent with providing their sexualorientation and information throughout the survey.Other ethical considerations include ensuring that the participant is aware of their right toprivacy throughout the study. Which will all be explained in the beginning of the study. I wouldlike to review the Nuremburg Code, that pertains to the permissible medical experiments.For the research proposal study, I would like to conduct a cross sectional study,which includes the specific population of the LGBTQ+ patients which involve asking themsurvey questions over a specific period. For a better explanation of what this research studywould look like, is to describe the questions that would be asked. I would ask for the participantto disclose their sexual orientation, the proceeding into understanding how their healthcare hasbeen affected by their sexual orientation. Then, I would conduct another questionnaire thatinvolves asking to rate their experiences and if possible have they felt any amount ofdiscrimination during their interaction with nurses and other healthcare professionals.This experience for these participants would be relatively simple, which is thediscretion of consent for the questionnaire. The study would consist of presumptively 15 or lessquestions throughout, therefore the participants would relatively endure a quick study. But Iwould also generalize the study for the cis-gender and their heterosexual counterparts being thatthey can identify if they’ve had any negative experiences with healthcare professionals andpossibly correlate that with the results from the LGBTQ+ population. From then, I wouldproceed to finish the study asking if implementing more culturally sensitive education for nursesand other healthcare providers influence a change in healthcare disparities for this population.CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 14The type of analysis I would use would be content analysis to understand the qualitativeresponses for the participants within the research design. I’m ultimately performing qualitativeresearch that involves understanding and assessing the rigor throughout my research that canserve for means of reliability and validity.Study DesignA mixed method study with a survey, including qualitative and quantitative questions,will be provided to LGBTQ+ patients and their responses will be studied. Sample and RecruitmentMy strategy for recruitment will be through use of social media, and a publicquestionnaire to Dominican University's student population who identifies as LGBTQ+. Ethical ConsiderationsSome ethical considerations would be to uphold the privacy of those who chose todisclose their sexual orientation and would prefer to remain anonymous. The LGBTQ+population is uniquely vulnerable being that their sexuality can create an excuse for a multitudeof socially unaccepted behaviors by others. The main trajectory of this research is to understandthe vulnerability that stems from cultural incompetence and bias that can be exhibited byhealthcare providers for people in this specific population. I would like to obtain consent for thissurvey to ensure that the participants are aware of what's involved in the study. The consentprocess will include explaining the study and ensuring a potential particpant understands theirinvolvement. To start the consent process, questions will be asked of participants regarding theiragreement to providing their sexual orientation and personal information. Other ethical considerations include ensuring that the participant is aware of theirright to privacy throughout the study, which will all be explained in the beginning of the study. ICULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 15will review the Nuremberg Code, which pertains to the permissible experiments, and theParticipants' Bill of Right with the potential participant.  MethodsFor this research proposal, I, first, will conduct a qualitative, cross-sectional study,which includes the specific population of the LGBTQ+ patients which involve asking themsurvey questions. The survey will be open for data collection over a three-month period.  Thequestions that will be asked are:● What is your sexual orientation? ● How has your sexual orientation affected your healthcare?● Have you ever felt neglected by a healthcare provider due to your sexual orientation? Ifso, please discuss your experience.A second questionnaire will ask participants to rate their experiences, using afive-point Likert Scale, and ask if they have felt any amount of discrimination during theirinteraction with nurses and other healthcare professionals.  This experience for these participants would be relatively simple, which is thediscretion of consent for the questionnaire. The study would consist of presumptively 15 or lessquestions throughout, therefore the participants would relatively endure a quick study. But Iwould also generalize the study for the cis-gender and their heterosexual counterparts being thatthey can identify if they’ve had any negative experiences with healthcare professionals andcompare that with the results from the LGBTQ+ population. From there, I would proceed tofinish the study asking if implementing more culturally sensitive education for nurses and otherhealthcare providers influence a change in healthcare disparities for this population.CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 16AnalysisThe type of analysis I would use would be content analysis for the open-endedquestions to understand the qualitative responses for the participants within the research design.For analysis of the Likert-Scale questions, descriptive statistics (such as percentages) will beused. I’m ultimately performing qualitative and quantitative research that involves understandingand assessing the rigor throughout my research that can serve for means of reliability andvalidity. ConclusionThroughout this review of research pertaining to understanding the implicit bias alongwith lack of cultural competency has created more awareness and knowledge to the LGBTQ+patients. There have been various studies that have been explained and review pertaining to;Implicit bias among nurses and other healthcare providers, understanding the effects ofincompetent care being the increased health care disparities with this specific population alongwith a review from increasing cultural competence within nurses and healthcare providerseducation and careers.The original question has been answered being that the cultural implicit bias, stigmas andlack of training and education has created the increase of health care disparities within theLGBTQ+ population. Understanding a portion of the root cause with the causative factors forhealth disparities within this population therefore creates an avenue for implementing potentiallyeffective education and training for the LGBTQ+ patients. Applying this information to clinicalpractice specifically will in fact, ultimately answer the original question and problem statementof the thesis. To treat a problem, there must be an understanding of what the main cause of theproblem is so that there can be effective clinical management for the LGBTQ+ patients.CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 17The proposed research that has been provided will advance the nursing professiontremendously within healthcare being that if they can understand more of the LGBTQ+ culturethey reduce their personal implicit stigmas and biases that serves as one of the causes for thehealth disparities. When nurses and other healthcare professionals can implement positiveexperience surrounding this specific population of patients, they will be more opted to seekhealthcare without the feeling of scrutiny or negative judgment. The articles researched withinthis study has shown that increasing cultural competence for the LGBTQ+ patients throughoutthe use of modules will effectively teach and enlighten nurses and other healthcare providersthroughout healthcare. There still needs to be an ample amount of research for this thesis topicbut with my proposed research soon there can possibly be a change in healthcare for theLGBTQ+ population.Some potential outcomes would be the reduction in the prevalence for healthcaredisparities for the LGBTQ+ population.CULTURAL BIASES AND DISPARITIES WITH LGBTQ+ PATIENTS 18ReferencesMargolies, L., & Brown, C.

    "abstract": "Understanding the health disparities within the LGBTQ+ population, will consist of educating Nurses and other healthcare providers cultural competence for this population, along with proposing certain educational training programs for all the medical professionals. There’s not only an implicit bias but also lack in quality of healthcare due to the personal reasons that healthcare providers may have, along with certain stigmas that creates an infringement on healthcare for this specific population. Members of the LGBTQ+ community will continue to have one of the highest amounts of health care disparities due to the lack of cultural incompetence if nothing is done",
