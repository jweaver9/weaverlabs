These communities are coming to understand the power of saying—as the Black Queer & Intersectional Collective of Columbus, Ohio has explained—”that the liberation of Black LGBTQIA+ people will lead to liberation for all people,” including all LGBTQIA+ people, and that “the freedom of Black queer and trans people cannot exist if another group is oppressed; our liberations are intertwined.”1 As these understandings take root outside the collectives and collective practices that help produce them, they are yielding cascading transformations in political consciousness that are reshaping what LGBTQ life is and what LGBTQ politics are about. *Isadore and Ida Topper Professor of Law, Michael E.

After the initial use of “LGBTQIA+” to track the language used by Black Queer & Intersectional  Collective, I use the shorter “LGBTQ” in the remainder of the work.

Nominally, the aim is to reflect on a real-time constitutional situation—driven by the Supreme Court’s newly enthroned constitutional originalist project—that has placed the constitutional abortion right first announced in Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed by Planned Parenthood v. Casey on the brink of extinction. 2 Vitally important in its own terms, this extinction is one that many fear (even as some others hope) will lead to LGBTQ constitutional rights and protections likewise being eliminated. The conceptual configuration around this potential one-two punch—played out around what the Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization will do to the abortion right and to LGBTQ constitutional rights by implication—expresses conventional forms of legal consciousness and the politics that they have helped inspire. 3 Produced by and within legal outlooks that have traditionally operated in single-axis identity terms, these ways of understanding constitutional developments around Dobbs miss what queer Black trans politics can readily see: The conventional constitutional fields of abortion rights and LGBTQ rights are not wholly distinct, related only in a legal series, but rather are aspects of a larger constitutional law that intersect and cross-inflect one another, and that likewise intersect and cross-inflect the Court’s constitutional race equality jurisprudence, itself a jurisprudence of colorblind constitutionalism increasingly organized under the sign of constitutional originalism, that has been turning against pro-Black, including pro-Black trans, and hence LGBTQ, positions for some time. On one level, these understandings make the work of thinking with queer Black trans politics look like a familiar intersectional intervention. In important ways, it is. The present effort broadly joins calls for moving from traditional forms of legal and political consciousness defined by single-axis identity thinking about race, sex, and LGBTQ identity and rights toward newer and more complex—not to forget, more socially accurate—forms of intersectional thinking about them and how they work. This undertaking is thus aligned with longstanding intersectional 2. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973); Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). 3. Dobbs v.

REV. 1563, 1573–74 (1984). 2022] QUEER BLACK TRANS POLITICS 95 praxis pushing to reconceptualize basic outlooks on U.S. constitutional civil rights. 4 Beyond demonstrating some of the transformative possibilities of thinking with queer Black trans politics, however, the argument in these pages also shows that intersectional praxis is making its way into civil rights litigation while also giving shape to conservative resistance to it. On this level, thinking with queer Black trans politics offers opportunities to glimpse how intersectional thinking is functioning, if not by name, as a tool not only supporting, but also opposing, pro-Black intersectional praxis. 5 This opposition has formally begun at times to re-cast progressive civil rights like abortion and LGBTQ rights in anti-Black terms as means of restricting or clawing them back. Venturing forth from queer Black trans politics’ intersectional and centering demands thus draws this creeping anti-Black intersectional practice into focus. It also helps to explain it by exposing moments when queer Black trans people personify the threats to existing race-sex-sexuality-gender-identity orders that so many people, prominently including many social conservatives, fear and oppose. Building on understandings that emerge from queer Black trans politics, the present work is structured as follows. Part I begins with a pro-Black, queer, and trans-aligned perspective on the Court’s race equality jurisprudence—a perspective that opens onto a critical topography of LGBTQ constitutional rights. From there, discussion shifts in Part II to how queer Black trans politics inform analysis in the abortion right setting, focusing on important dimensions of the Dobbs litigation, including how different legal actors imagine Dobbs mapping onto—and thus implicating—LGBTQ constitutional rights. Building on this engagement, Part III then takes up what constitutional originalism looks like from a perspective informed by queer Black trans politics. Here, constitutional originalism appears to be more than a force that has constrained pro-Black politics, and more than a force poised to decimate the constitutional abortion right in Dobbs. Originalism, on this understanding, is also a project that implicates LGBTQ constitutional positions—positions that have been in its sights all along as expressions of constitutional race equality and constitutional abortion rights guarantees. The Conclusion, Part IV, summarizes how a queer Black trans 4. One effort in the constitutional civil rights setting that should not be missed is in Devon W.Carbado & Kimberlé W.

For some important theoretical and historical context, see infra note 12.96 CONLAWNOW [13:93 politics-inspired perspective refracts constitutional politics in distinctive ways that reveal some of the powers of insight and foresight that queer Black trans politics possess. Among the many other things they do, queer Black trans politics offer perspectives on, and positions within, LGBTQ politics that LGBTQ communities should seriously engage in the days ahead, as—in the aftermath of Dobbs and anticipating other constitutional originalist transformations—political and constitutional challenges to LGBTQ rights continue to mount. Queer Black trans politics teach that the security of LGBTQ rights remains largely in LGBTQ people’s hands. I. COLORBLIND CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGINALISM AND LGBTQ RIGHTSIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RACE EQUALITY SETTINGTracking queer Black trans politics’ intersectional commitments andtheir calls to center Black trans people, it is apparent that Black trans people’s constitutional rights, along with the rights of other Black LGBTQ people, have for some time now been subject to the force and weight of the Supreme Court’s commitments to a colorblind constitutionalism—a jurisprudence that, as it has been evolving, is increasingly being reorganized under the sign of, and as an expression of, constitutional originalism, a trend that the Supreme Court’s present composition seems likely to bring to doctrinal completion. 6 Familiar as the background constellation of points may be, they are regularly lost in conversations about LGBTQ rights as points implicating them. Broadly speaking, and formulated in these newer and somewhat anticipatory terms, the Court’s colorblind originalist jurisprudence can be figured as having generated a range of legal doctrines and rules indicating the Court’s retreat from earlier constitutional race equality decisions that, in different ways, marked out—and delivered on—a transformative, anti-subordinationist vision of constitutionally-based racial justice, itself articulated with an historically informed contemporary eye to what the Civil War Amendments demand. 7 6. Michael B. Rappaport, Originalism and the Colorblind Constitution, 89 NOTRE DAME L.REV. 71 (2013), offers an important conceptual pivot.

REV. 2022] QUEER BLACK TRANS POLITICS 97 In lieu of that project, the Court’s constitutional colorblindness decisions have aligned the Court’s racial justice docket with formal equality principles that have been sharply critiqued for tracking race-hierarchical and ideologically white supremacist positions. 8 Consistent with what those positions recommend, the Court, years back, abandoned playing a meaningful role in constitutionally developing, then managing, far-reaching institutional transformations of the ideological and material conditions of racial injustice in the United States in pro-Black directions.9 Instead, the Court has for some time now regularly announced colorblindness-centered or colorblindness-corresponding legal rules that, in different ways, constrict governmental powers at the national, state, and local levels, increasingly circumscribing the space for purposefully pro-Black political outcomes to be realized in law in race-conscious ways.10 87, 127–41 (2022); see also generally, e.g., Rebecca E.

The Court’s colorblind originalism thus rules LGBTQ peoples’ lived experiences of race-based constitutional rights. Recognizing this, there has long been something comprehensible, if also highly problematic and misguided, about pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights arguments premised on racial analogies designed to get LGBTQ people access to constitutional race equality protections’ safe harbors. The move is comprehensible, since the Court formally sees its constitutional race jurisprudence as being about race—not sexual orientation, or LGBTQ identities or rights more generally. The “like-race” analogy remains highly problematic, however, in erroneously suggesting that there is a fully rationalizable—and sustainable—parallel to be offered as a bridge between LGBTQ-inflected constitutional arguments, on the one purposes or intentions, on which, see ERWIN CHEMERINSKY, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 768–78 (6th ed. 2019), whether they are facially race-based is not the sole consideration for assessing their constitutionality. 11.

Q. 275, 275 (2017). Additional relevant perspective, including perspective on how ostensibly non-intersectional forms of jurisprudence nevertheless are capable of validating claims of white men, is in Kimberlé Crenshaw, Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics, 1989 U.

Its deployment within constitutional efforts to gain—or preserve—LGBTQ constitutional rights regularly breezes past how the Court’s colorblindness rules have fostered inequality in Black people’s, including Black LGBTQ people’s, lives. In these ways, “like-race” thinking in constitutional argument involving LGBTQ rights regularly syncs with, and furthers, post-racial 13. Not that the Court’s race equality jurisprudence does not implicate sexual orientation orsexuality, as perhaps most notably, though hardly exclusively, in McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184 (1964), and Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967). 14.

Board of Education and Loving v. Virginia to the present day, an era said to be defined by post-racial racial equity, as the future will be—but without fully reckoning with the race-unequal social conditions that the Court’s colorblind originalist project, for its part, has wrought. 16 Turning toward the Supreme Court’s foundational pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights rulings, the Court’s single-axis identity thinking about race has helped underwrite its pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights project, but in ways that subtly mark it in intersectional terms—contingently, not only about LGBTQ identity (chiefly lesbian and gay identity), but also whiteness, along with cisness and middle-classness, all elements in the homonormative “white club” that, as far back as the early 1970’s, Sylvia Rivera publicly condemned. 17 Alignments with these forms of social privilege—and others—have paved the way for LGBTQ constitutional rights, including the right to marry that Obergefell v. Hodges announced, to harmonize with, and, at times, to pinkwash, different kinds of pro-white political efforts—from racial capitalism to settler colonialism to imperialism to white nationalism—by making it seem impossible to believe the same Court that would vindicate LGBTQ rights could likewise vindicate white privilege and white racialized hierarchies, much less at the same time. 18 16.

By contrast, in the valley below, LGBTQ people’s rights, powerfully shaped by the Court’s anti-pro-Black colorblind originalism, entail a harder truth of constitutional rollbacks and constitutionally approved closures of the political space for fomenting robust and forthrightly pro-Black anti-subordinationist positions—positions that, in a wide sense, would also vindicate the rights of Black trans and other Black LGBTQ people. The constitutional rights that the Court and others still regularly consider to be “LGBTQ rights” are the constitutional rights up on the hill. Access to them formally remains open to Black trans and other Black LGBTQ people—if and when they are like their white, cis, and socioeconomically at least middle-classed lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer sisters and brothers. Notice how this configuration inverts traditional “like-race” arguments. 20 Whiteness, along with cisness and class privilege, serve here as the model for LGBTQ constitutional rights protections, a fact that might be surprising were whiteness not already the touchstone for the racialized originalist rules that govern in the valley below, as they govern the remainder of the Court’s race equality jurisprudence. 21 Nor should it be surprising to anyone that efforts to oppose LGBTQ constitutional rights and other LGBTQ rights up on the hill have, at times, Hodges, effectively bracket the history of racialized definitions of marriage, both in the antebellum South and the Jim Crow era, along with marriage’s and family law’s wider racial inflections, on which, see, for example, Shani King, The Family Law Canon in a (Post?) Racial Era, 72 OHIO ST. L.J. 575 (2011).19. Venturing no simplistic causation claims, certain rough correspondences to thisconstitutional topography are found, in different ways, in and as normative structures of sexuality and sexual desire operative “inside” LGBTQ communities, on which consider Russell K. Robinson & David M. Frost, LGBTQ Equality and Sexual Racism, 86 FORDHAM L. REV. 2739 (2018). For a classic variation of the hill/valley imagery in other terms and in another context, see Yale Kamisar, Equal Justice in the Gatehouses and Mansions of American Criminal Procedure, in CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OUR TIME 1 (1965). 20. Along these lines, consider the argument detailed in Serena Mayeri, Reconstructing theRace-Sex Analogy, 49 WM. & MARY L. REV. 1789 (2008). 21. This is not derived from Darren Hutchinson’s “inversion thesis,” but that thesis neverthelessprovides a helpful framework for understanding the constitutional topography being described here.

Clayton County, the case announcing that anti-gay and anti-trans discrimination are forms of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 22 While Bostock is, by its own terms, a statutory interpretation decision, the majority opinion in the case, in a deep sense, conforms to, and draws supports from, the Court’s pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights jurisprudence. 23 A series of notable anti-gay and anti-trans arguments in Bostock—of keen interest to those concerned with queer Black trans politics—focused on the pro-trans Title VII anti-discrimination claim in one of the cases Bostock collects, Aimee Stephens’s sex discrimination case against her former employer, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., which discriminated against her because she was trans. 24 Pro-defense arguments in this case traded in ideologically saturated stereotypes about trans people as part of positions urging the Court to deny trans people statutory sex discrimination rights, suggesting that trans people—and specifically trans women—posed imminent sexual threats to cisheterosexual women (described simply as “women” in these accounts). Pro-defense briefing and oral arguments in Stephens’s case repeatedly involved trans women being misgendered and maligned by positions that depressingly reproduced familiar anti-trans cultural scripts that figure trans people, and trans women more particularly, fantastically and wholly unsupported by any facts, as sexual monsters who do and would do terrible and sexually injurious things to women in showers and locker rooms if only given the chance. The idea here was that a pro-trans ruling in Stephens’s case would 22. Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).23.

What was evident, however, to anyone broadly familiar with the U.S. cultural archive, including its genealogies of sexual violence, was that the anti-trans fantasies circulating in Bostock drew their rhetorical form and power from fantastical and malignant slaver misrepresentations of African-American men, noxiously figured, consistent with “colonial racialization . . . [and] mythologization,” as sexually irrepressible beasts who pose an ever-present threat to white women in ways that warrant—even demand—vigilant and subordinating collective responses. 26 The anti-trans fantasies at work in Bostock—themselves unhinged and group-based projections, which, on one understanding, tacitly figured Black trans women as intersectionally personifying their anti-trans concerns—were, as in historical white supremacist anti-Black discourses, the conjurings of white and, apparently, cisheterosexual men. Sourcing aside, the cultural imperatives of these fantasies of sexual violence exceeded the seemingly measured calls for the Court to deny that anti-trans discrimination was prohibited sex discrimination under federal law. 27 Beyond that, these imaginary spectacles of violence stretched toward enjoining the state to respond to the looming, racialized trans menace through its monopoly on legitimate violence, deploying criminalization, policing, and punishment, to stop it. Curiously, it was not those responses so much as another that pro-defense arguments focused on. Here, one notable thought was that the looming trans menace should be handled by handing trans people back over to the psychiatric professions, the asylum being more apt as social management response than affording trans people sex discrimination protections under law. 28 25.

This is not exactly to say that they failed—or were defeated outright. Bostock nowhere openly engaged these arguments to discredit them. Instead, Bostock set the arguments focused on trans women in showers and locker rooms to one side as matters for another day. 29 Leaving the possibilities for their return open this way, if and when they do come back, as seems likely, what the Court will make of them may, like Bostock, turn on the status at that point of the Court’s LGBTQ constitutional rights decisions—the cases up on the hill—and whether, by then, the Court’s originalist project will have driven all LGBTQ people’s constitutional rights into the valley below through a new constitutional originalist jurisprudence that broadly flattens out the wider topography of LGBTQ rights. 30 II. QUEER BLACK TRANS POLITICS IN THE ABORTION RIGHTS SETTINGThinking with queer Black trans politics also reconfigureswidespread legal and popular understandings of the stakes of the originalist challenges that have dominated the Dobbs litigation, now focused less on its constitutional challenge to Mississippi’s fifteen-week abortion ban than on Mississippi’s pro-life originalist defense of that law, grounded in an originalist take-down of Roe, Casey, and the abortion right as an alternative statutory ground of support for the trans rights claims involved in the case, and perhaps the lesbian and gay rights claims argued for in it, as well. To the extent that historical forms of white supremacy and anti-Blackness determine trans people’s rights—or lesbian women’s or gay men’s or other people’s rights—they might be understood to be part of the protean ways that racial  hierarchy reproduces itself, including how it intersects with other supremacist ideologies, including cisheterosexism. Race equality tools like Title VII’s ban on sex discrimination could thus be marshalled against them. 29. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1753.30.

In this setting, originalism has practical repercussions for legal protections covering sex equality, as well. Conventionally, the constitutional abortion right encodes liberty figured as belonging to cisgender, and, more exactly, cisheterosexual, women, largely on the supposition that the pregnancies that abortions end result from sex these women had with cisheterosexual men. Within this sex-binaristic and cisheterosexualized matrix, the constitutional abortion right implicates cisheterosexual women’s equality with cisheterosexual men, and hence sex equality in a wider sense, at least as a function of abortion’s social and political meanings, if not how it has been consecrated in constitutional doctrine, chiefly on privacy or liberty rationales. 31 If not self-evident, the whiteness of the cisheterosexualized constitutional abortion right, along with its relative class locations come into focus by attending to Roe’s simultaneous rhetorical foregrounding and legal backgrounding of cisheterosexual women in the course of announcing the constitutional abortion right.32 The abortion right that Roe 31.

Also worth noting here is how faithful pro-life work against constitutional abortion protections is itself deeply invested in cisheterosexualized understandings of womanhood and “motherhood.” Conservative religious pro-choice positions have, at times, been reactive and responsive to those kinds of claims, though, candidly, pro-choice commitments do also at times have their own independent commitments to thinking in traditional heterosexualized and gender binaristic terms. 32.

Among other facets of LGBTQ life, the brief distinctively engages the reproductive realities faced by Black, poor, young, trans, as well as non-binary “sexual minority” people who might need—and should have—the constitutional abortion right. 44 Without singularly centering Black trans people and their experiences with sex, contraception, healthcare, pregnancy, and the reproductive freedoms that they do and do not enjoy, the LGBTQ organizations and advocates brief holds important space for them and thus affirms what queer Black trans politics also understand: The depiction of abortion rights as about white, cisheterosexual, and socioeconomically privileged people registers only a part of a larger social picture. Though the abortion right was forged around cisheterosexual women and other kinds of social privilege, LGBTQ people do rely on it, hardly without challenge, as with other forms of healthcare LGBTQ people need. As such, it has become a right that LGBTQ people need and use—and in that sense at least, abortion is an LGBTQ right. Thus, Dobbs—a case about the right of pregnant people to end unwanted pregnancies—is also an LGBTQ rights case. If and when Dobbs 40. Reminders of this tradition are in URVASHI VAID, IRRESISTIBLE REVOLUTION:CONFRONTING RACE, CLASS, AND THE ASSUMPTIONS OF LGBT POLITICS 4, 41, 63, 122, 136, 139, 142, 172 (2012). 41.

As Kierra Johnson, Executive Director of the National LGBTQ Task Force, put it in a public statement addressed to LGBTQ communities the day that Dobbs was argued: If you think this decision will not affect you, think again: a wrong decision by the Supreme Court means you, too, will lose your bodily autonomy, your ability to own your own personal and community power. This is not just about abortion; it is about controlling bodies based on someone else determining your worthiness. This is a  racial justice issue. This is a  women’s issue. It is an LGBTQ issue. It is a  civil rights issue. These are our fundamental rights that are at stake.45 Johnson’s statement understandably frames Dobbs’ immediate danger to LGBTQ people in broad terms—terms that emphasize “bodily autonomy” and self-control, in order to make its case to LGBTQ publics who need to hear its message. But what it says is more narrowly true just as to the abortion right itself. That right—hence Dobbs—involves racial justice, women’s equality, and LGBTQ rights, and it does so all at once. The statement’s stance bespeaks intersectionality this way, though it is articulated so that even non-intersectionality-savvy LGBTQ audiences can hear it. If the Court’s originalist project comes for Roe and Casey and the constitutional abortion right in Dobbs, it will come for the lived rights, freedom, and equality of people in all these groups—groups that are themselves interconnected partly by virtue of the people who make them up, including Black trans people and Black cis lesbian, bisexual, and other sexually identified queer women. What all this means is that Dobbs’ impact on LGBTQ people’s constitutional rights is not only off at a distance, as many still think—about, say, what Dobbs will or will not do to undermine the foundations of LGBTQ constitutional rights up on that hill, or what Dobbs will or will not mean, down the road, for continued recognition of that same group of rights. Dobbs does raise those questions, to be sure, but its impact on 45.

To fail to recognize this is to fail to recognize what liberty and equality mean for LGBTQ people who are or who may become pregnant. It misunderstands who LGBTQ people are—and what LGBTQ people need to be free. Viewed critically and aligned with queer Black trans politics-inspired realism, if one begins with an appreciation for the racial logics of the Court’s colorblind originalism, the pro-choice litigation strategy in Dobbs—highlighting abortion’s meaning to different kinds of pregnant people—involved a long-term strategic play. It might not move a single conservative Supreme Court justice committed to a pro-life originalism in Dobbs into the pro-Roe or pro-Casey column (though who knows?), but the strategy could easily inform dissents in Dobbs that will sow the seeds of future doctrinal innovations re-establishing abortion protections in their lived intersectional realities, a new Roe for a new day. In other directions, the pro-choice intersectionality strategy in Dobbs speaks the lived truths of the abortion right in a way that advertises the practices of, and the ongoing need for, a broad political vision of reproductive justice that, going forward, is ready to underwrite intersectional reproductive rights protections, and in ways that may reshape local, state, and even national U.S. politics. 46 Doctrinally, the pro-choice intersectionality strategy in Dobbs may already have helped draw out its own form of unintended dialectical resistance—one that syncs the Court’s treatment of the abortion right with the broad, rights-denying impulses of the Court’s ostensibly colorblind originalism. During oral arguments in Dobbs, Justice Clarence Thomas repeatedly invoked—seemingly approvingly—“a case out of South Carolina . . . [that] involved a woman who had been convicted of criminal child neglect because she ingested cocaine during pregnancy.”47 46.

For 2022] QUEER BLACK TRANS POLITICS 111 Read in terms of political geography that meets both pro-life politics and the racialized war on drugs head-on, Justice Thomas’s questions raised the prospect that pro-life originalist approval of abortion bans may soon start blessing other forms of criminal-law-based state management of pregnant people generally, but with a distinctive “colorblind” eye on Black women’s mind-bodies and lives. 48 Consistent with pro-life logics that, in racial terms, trace racial capitalist histories to human reproduction during the long era of U.S. slavery, both as an effect and a cause of racialized wealth, it is possible that Dobbs will practically open the door for treating Black cis women’s and Black trans people’s and other women’s bodies as forms of public commons that are to be managed and overseen by the state, backed by the imprimatur of the Constitution as defined by the Supreme Court. 49 So much for the Civil War Amendments and their original, grand promises of freedom and self-possession—and originalism’s own claims to historical objectivity and political neutrality. 50 It is no comfort that all pregnant women—and other pregnant people—may be treated the same way, consistent with constitutional equality demands. more from Justice Thomas himself on race and abortion, see Box v.

WHEN CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGINALISM MEETS THE COURT’SPRO-LGBTQ CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS DECISIONS ON THE HILLAs important as everything to this point has been—and is—on its own terms, it is all also useful in producing a new set of critical understandings of what a pro-life constitutional originalist decision in Dobbs might mean for and do to those constitutional LGBTQ rights decisions on the hill that have been in the same Fourteenth Amendment liberty family as Roe and Casey. These new understandings are not only fostered by, but they also have implications for, queer Black trans politics and how they circulate in LGBTQ communities in the shorter and longer term. While there are different ways to thread the originalist needle, from the point of view that I have been developing—recognizing what the Court’s constitutional originalism has meant for race equality and what it may soon mean for sex equality—it looks like the Court’s originalist project already has LGBTQ people’s constitutional rights in its sights. The wonder here is not what Dobbs may soon mean for LGBTQ rights generally, but what it may mean for those other LGBTQ rights up on that hill, and how, in principle, they could be treated any differently. At this juncture, it is worth returning to Bostock and glimpsing its presumably unintended underbelly. Maligned by a number of conservatives as an act of textualist interpretive infidelity and sometimes also as an act of pro-gay and pro-trans political treason, Justice Neil Gorsuch’s Bostock opinion has been welcomed in many pro-LGBTQ and feminist circles as a case that, at long last, without saying so in so many words, has recognized the tight, unbreakable social link forged inside male supremacist ideologies between and among sexism, anti-gay, and anti-trans discrimination. 51 Whether seen in terms of progressive 51.

Without any significant conceptual effort, Bostock can readily be redeployed as a legal device for translating an originalist set-back to the abortion right in Dobbs, itself, practically, a set-back to sex equality rights, into other sex-based originalist losses—losses that may limit or likewise unwind LGBTQ victories in cases like Lawrence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Hodges. 52 This prospect presents a new way to apprehend Bostock’s curious, if careful, avoidance of any express mention, much less engaged discussion, of the Supreme Court’s pro-LGBTQ constitutional decisions up on the hill—no matter how those decisions underwrite and structure its sense of what legal justice required in the case. 53 It is, frankly, hard to conceive of Bostock as a legal long-con by a mustachios-twisting textualist/originalist justice who secretly and strategically cast homophobia and transphobia as sexism in Bostock in order to prefigure an alley-oop after a case like Dobbs that would turn this pro-LGBTQ textualist victory into authority for subsequent anti-LGBTQ constitutional originalist defeats. Intentions aside, Bostock’s capacity for redeployment as authority for overturning the Court’s pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights decisions after Dobbs is now impossible to miss. If and when the moves are formally placed upon the table, even Justice Gorsuch could conceivably join. The explanation might be that nothing in Bostock anyway committed him to upholding the Court’s pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights decisions. 54 (“See? I didn’t even cite them!”) While such a ruling would be at odds with more straightforward understandings of Bostock’s letter and spirit, it is the kind of turn-about that a long view of the Court’s so-called colorblind originalism—like the kind of critical perspective that queer Black trans politics helps to tee up—Discrimination, 69 N.Y.U.

Settled judgments about constitutional and legal protections, after all, rise and fall, and when they fall, they not uncommonly do so through sometimes clever, if also highly dubious means. Across the sweep of U.S. history, pro-white and anti-Black racialized forms of individual and institutional power have demonstrated stunning talents for scanning a political/legal situation and sensing how anti-racist and pro-Black power formations are in play and at work—in order to move to thwart them. Note in this light the possible stakes of LGBTQ communities getting sharper and more aggressive in their anti-racist and anti-white-supremacist alignments and commitments. 55 The more that LGBTQ communities proudly stand to be counted as part of what has, at times, disparagingly been termed the “Great Awokening,” a term that itself calls out to be queered, the greater the chances that LGBTQ rights will come under fire from that colorblind originalist project that has done so much to constrict race equality rights, elements of the lived, intersectional rights of Black trans and non-trans LGBTQ people. 56 If this process holds to pattern, including as expected on the abortion right front, even those LGBTQ rights on the hill could be sent down to the valley of rights. From there, they would presumably be returned to the arena of ordinary politics, subject, once again, to surveillance and management by new iterations of old forms of religious and moral anti-LGBTQ opposition that, in the past, sought to order and control them by placing them under the overlapping strictures of religious, moral, legal, medical, and socio-cultural domination. What other futures might life in the valley of LGBTQ rights hold in store? What additional, constitutionally approved constraints might limit chances of getting free of them? For now, anyway, the Supreme Court’s pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights jurisprudence, comprised of those cases up on the hill, does seem basically secure enough. Notwithstanding how a pro-life originalist decision in Dobbs will weaken its foundations, the Court’s pro-LGBTQ rights jurisprudence may hold, escaping a wholesale reversal by the 55.

Mississippi’s pro-life originalist positions in Dobbs indicated that that is where Mississippi’s lawyers thought the Supreme Court stood on the question. Bare-knuckled as Mississippi’s pro-life originalist politics were—whaling on Roe and Casey for their non-originalism, said to be sufficient to overturn them— the state pulled its punches where non-originalist pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights decisions like Lawrence and Obergefell were concerned. 57 On one view, this was not merely Mississippi ably counting to five. In a deeper sense, it was about how vote counting on the ongoing constitutional status of LGBTQ rights up on the hill involves the status of a constitutional compromise realignment and re-grounding of LGBTQ constitutional rights first announced by the Supreme Court Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruling, Justice Anthony Kennedy’s swansong opinion on his signature jurisprudential issue of LGBTQ constitutional rights. 58 Needless to say, this focus on these LGBTQ constitutional rights and how their preservation will shape Justice Kennedy’s historical legacy stands at a striking distance from a decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop centered on or around Black trans lives—or rights. Many have treated Masterpiece Cakeshop as a narrow, shallow, and modest ruling of no great constitutional moment. Subsequent developments have helped clarify this reading is wish fulfillment—not what the opinion is or does, but what some of its pro-LGBTQ readers might like it to mean. 59 Masterpiece Cakeshop instead quietly produced a highly significant shift in the Court’s basic conceptualization of, and approach to, LGBTQ constitutional rights up on the hill. It lifted them up in order to set them back down on different constitutional foundations. The Court’s early pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights decisions evolved through rulings in which the Court generally treated lesbian and gay rights as emerging within a politically liberal, or perhaps more precisely, a politically libertarian, constitutional tradition and order. In it, religious and moral views on homosexuality and same-sex relationships, including marriage, had—and were declared to have—no legitimate role to play in setting state policy on the prospects of, and for, LGBTQ life. Religious and moral views opposing LGBTQ people and their rights were 57. Compare Brief for Petitioners at 18, Dobbs v.

An assessment of these possibilities and citations to some relevant sources are in MarcSpindelman, Masterpiece Cakeshop’s Homiletics, 68 CLEV. ST. L. REV. 347, 349 n.2 (2020). 116 CONLAWNOW [13:93 thus openly dismissed in the Court’s pre-Masterpiece Cakeshop, pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights decisions as so much unconstitutional discrimination. Religious and moral positions against lesbian and gay rights were variously held to be—in constitutional terms—forms of illicit animus (read: hate) or irrationality (read: madness).60 If these decisions thus struck many faithful conservatives and traditional moralists as a constitutionally based affront—an affront that many liberals and progressive secretly or not so secretly cheered—they also, beyond insult, involved what many perceived to be forms of constitutional emasculation. They stripped faithful conservatives and traditional moralists of the political authority they had long enjoyed as, if not a set of proper constitutional rights, then anyway, constitutionally affirmed prerogatives, by which they could enforce their normative visions of what homosexuality’s status under law should look like. 61 Right at the cusp of his retirement from the Court, then poised to lurch rightward, Justice Kennedy’s Masterpiece Cakeshop opinion set out to shore up, and thus to preserve, the basics of then-existing LGBTQ constitutional rights up on that hill, but in a way that resituated them atop a differently inflected vision of the constitutionally governed political order. Moving from a politically liberal, or libertarian, constitutional vision that kept religion and morality at the margins and so basically out of public life, certainly where LGBTQ rights were concerned, Masterpiece Cakeshop announced that, going forward, LGBTQ constitutional rights would be protected within a secular and religious pluralistic constitutional order in which religious conservatism and traditional moralism, like LGBTQ forms of life, were entitled to full and equal respect, as constitutionally protected ways to live a good life. 62 In these terms, far from the kinds of social margins marked by queer Black trans politics, Masterpiece Cakeshop is a precedent in the manner of an LGBTQ rights version of the joint opinion Justice Kennedy co-authored in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, with its famous “Pax Roeana”: 60. See, e.g., Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996); Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558,574, 577–78 (2003); Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 672–76 (2015). 61. This is context for the claim that “the justices have never reversed Supreme Court precedentto take away a freedom long enjoyed by Americans, with the possible exception of one time, in 1937,” and that doing so in Dobbs “would violate one of the fundamental-yet-unwritten rules of Supreme Court jurisprudence that liberal and conservative majorities alike have respected for many years. ” Noah Feldman, Reversing Roe Would Risk Supreme Court Legitimacy, BLOOMBERG LAW (Oct. 24, 2021), https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/reversing-roe-would-risk-supreme-court -legitimacy-noah-feldman/. 62. Capturing what are, no doubt, more widely shared sentiments is the critique offered by Kyle Velte, Postponement as Precedent, 29 S. CAL. REV. L & SOC. JUST. 1 (2019), on the level of social  meaning. 2022] QUEER BLACK TRANS POLITICS 117 a kind of brokered constitutional compromise that, it was hoped, would preserve “everyone’s” constitutional rights while securing an enduring constitutional and political peace by giving “all” the parties to these culture wars investments in the Supreme Court’s authority as a neutral but fair and trustworthy arbiter. 63 (The truth is: not really “everyone” and not really “all.”) In Masterpiece Cakeshop, the Court reaffirmed the basics of pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights protections while declaring different First Amendment rights that faithful conservatives and traditional moralists enjoyed. 64 The Court even recognized that some would-be extensions of the liberty and equality promises of the Court’s earlier pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights decisions might have to be sacrificed, snipped at least at their ostensible margins, so that clashing constitutional values could be accommodated under the peace sign of strict, strict state neutrality as between these warring ways of life. 65 Neither side would get everything they wanted, but then neither side would have reason to fear their basic ways of living would be subject to their enemies gaining the political, then legal, upper hand to try to squash them. Hence Masterpiece Cakeshop’s rule that the state and its agents must not, in service of pro-LGBTQ liberty and equality promises, be casual in their respect for a neutral stance between the parties to the case, much as the Court itself had been in its earlier pro-LGBTQ rights rulings. 66 Masterpiece Cakeshop’s various opinions made it appear this was a consensus position on the Court. Though not without some contraindications since, the leading decisions in Masterpiece Cakeshop’s wake involving LGBTQ rights and the rights of faithful conservatives and traditional moralists—prominently, Bostock and, just last year, Fulton v. City of Philadelphia—have broadly reaffirmed Masterpiece Cakeshop’s delicate Pax Obergefell-ana. 67 Not even Mississippi’s bull-in-a-china-shop originalism dared disturb it. 68 63.

It is possible the118 CONLAWNOW [13:93 How long this peace Masterpiece Cakeshop worked out will hold in the aftermath of a pro-life originalist decision in Dobbs, particularly as the Court’s originalist project continues to crest, is anyone’s guess. From a principled originalist point of view, the distinction that Mississippi offered the Court in Dobbs, by which it could overturn Roe and Casey while leaving established pro-LGBTQ constitutional rights rulings like Lawrence and Obergefell in place, sounded much more in pro-life views and values proper than anything corresponding to originalist theory as such. Mississippi’s lawyers told the Dobbs Court that none of its originalist arguments against Roe and Casey, including its originalist attack on the general privacy right out of which Roe grew, need be extended to apply to Lawrence or Obergefell in Dobbs. 69 Those cases, unlike Roe and Casey, Mississippi explained, did not involve “a right to destroy human life.”70 In closer step with Scalian originalist positions on abortion and LGBTQ rights, opposed to one and all, and more forthcoming about the likely actual intentions of many faithful, pro-life originalists, is the position taken up by the Dobbs amicus brief filed by Texas Right to Life, listing as counsel of record Jonathan Mitchell, the so-called mastermind behind Texas’ S.B. 8, which has rehearsed the on-the-ground elimination of abortion rights while Roe and Casey formally remain good law, meantime sending word out their time is nigh. 71 The brief’s closing passage speaks with (depending on your views) rousing and spine-chilling confidence, evidently convinced it is already safe to look beyond a pro-life originalist victory in Dobbs to the next-line originalist battles ahead. Thus, the brief offers an originalist take on Lawrence and Obergefell, along with some practical advice for the Court. The Texas Right to Life brief’s originalist line succinctly characterizes Lawrence and Obergefell as being “as lawless as Roe.”72 Court’s eventual decision in this case will “simply” rebalance the Masterpiece Cakeshop compromise without displacing it by overturning the underlying pro-LGBTQ constitutional precedents whose scope it is widely understood to implicate. 69.

Brief of Texas Right to Life, supra note 71, at 25.2022] QUEER BLACK TRANS POLITICS 119 Like Roe, neither homosexual sodomy nor same-sex marriage is expressly protected by the Constitution, and no history or tradition under law, relevant in a conservative originalist sense, supports them. 73 While that presumably means they should meet the same fate the brief contemplates for Roe, the brief tells the Court that it is not necessary to make the announcement in Dobbs. But, the brief hastens to add, “neither should the Court hesitate to write an opinion that leaves those decisions [Lawrence and Obergefell] hanging by a thread.”74 The brief’s justification for this treatment of Lawrence and Obergefell—leaving them dangling by a thread without formally overruling them—is more or less the reason Mississippi offered to the Court, but with a sly twist. Despite being “as lawless as Roe,” the Texas Right to Life brief explains, Lawrence and Obergefell do not have to be treated the same as Roe in Dobbs, because they do not involve the same degree of threat to life Roe does. Consider the brief’s exact words: “Lawrence and Obergefell, while far less hazardous to human life, are as lawless as Roe.”75 The curious precision of the brief’s negative comparison of Roe with Lawrence and Obergefell—the latter two cases being “far less hazardous to human life” than Roe, not simply non-hazardous to them—resurfaces old school associations by which cisheterosexuality and homosexuality and gender non-binarism have been seen as different and properly hierarchized. Whereas cisheterosexuality has traditionally been associated through ideas about procreation and childbirth with health, vitality, life, and regeneration, by negative implication and in contrast, homosexuality and gender non-conformity have traditionally run through ideas about their non-procreativity to a sense that they involve degeneration, barrenness, waste, disease, decay, weakness, and death, life’s very end.76 Seen in these terms, and reminiscent of how some of these associations carried the day in the mid-1980s when Bowers v. Hardwick declared homosexual sodomy not to be encompassed by constitutional privacy guarantees during an important moment in the HIV/AIDS pandemic, Lawrence and Obergefell, on the Texas Right to Life brief’s view, look to partake of what has sometimes been characterized as a “culture of 73.

Re-upping queer Black trans politics and their angles of vision onto social life, there is a question about what it means for the Texas Right to Life’s brief to line up Lawrence and Obergefell as lawless rulings associated with a culture of death as conditions for how the Supreme Court should respond to them. Without overlooking how these lawless threats to “ordinary” life may sound in racial registers, the Texas Right to Life brief’s suggestion that the Court string Lawrence and Obergefell up and leave them publicly hanging by a thread figures them as both alive, and, immanently dead—a death that will, like Dobbs, vindicate a conservative, traditionalist culture of life. This is yet another, potent reminder, were any needed, of the deep, intense, and both racialized and gendered passions that pro-life constitutional originalism unleashes and channels in the setting of abortion rights that already involves—and anticipates—carry-overs into other LGBTQ constitutional rights. If Mississippi’s lawyers spoke to the Court about reasonable public debate and political compromise around abortion, the Texas Right to Life brief shows how hard that is going to be in Dobbs’ wake when, even before it comes down, both gloves—and bets—are off. 78 Given how the Court’s originalist decisions have already allowed Black trans and other Black LGBTQ people’s constitutional rights to be rolled back, and given what the Court in Dobbs seems likely to do to devastate the abortion right, a right that Black trans and other LGBTQ people have relied on, the momentum continues to build toward an originalist coup de grace for those LGBTQ constitutional rights that, up on the hill, seem in their basics, anyway, safe—for now. 77. 478 U.S. 186 (1986).

Transcript of Oral Argument, supra note 47, at 5–6.2022] QUEER BLACK TRANS POLITICS 121 IV.  CONCLUSIONAs everyone awaits the Court’s decision in Dobbs, this much is certain: Queer Black trans politics—significantly themselves politics of precarity built at the de-centered margins of social, including political and legal, life—entail ample resources for generating new angles of vision on how power is organized and deployed, including by the Supreme Court through its originalist project, now plainly on the march. 79 Thinking with queer Black trans politics helps to illuminate some of the ways that pro-Black intersectional thinking is now being met—and reworked—by different legal actors in politically regressive directions through practices of intersectional thinking that, without necessarily using those terms, racially recast progressive rights claims, like claims about abortion and LGBTQ rights, in order to stop or defeat them. Even more, thinking with queer Black trans politics broadly indicates the ongoing need to rethink how constitutional civil rights are conceived. Challenging dominant forms of legal and political consciousness, that work—if not in precisely the same ways as more well-known forms of intersectional praxis that engage constitutional civil rights—may seem to some to be utopian, perhaps pointless, even downright dangerous, given how it may imperil established constitutional civil rights guarantees. Still, the high stepping of the Supreme Court’s now-majoritarian originalist project, precisely by circumscribing and eliminating existing civil rights protections, may paradoxically help clear space for the intellectual and legal work of building a constitutional future out of intersectional ideals—including the prospect that intersectionality writ large might hold room center stage for queer Black trans lives. 80 It is presently difficult to imagine a pro-queer-Black-trans constitutionalism that, as a national consensus position, delivers queer Black trans people the constitutional promises of liberty and equality that they deserve.

Queer Black trans collectives, as well as queer Black trans activists and organizers, have variously suggested they are broadly uninterested in entrusting queer Black trans people’s welfare and futures to institutional and political governors or other social managers who have, sometimes with the cooperation of “white club” LGBTQ politics, left queer Black trans communities largely to fend for themselves, their security, their lives, and their worlds. Recognizing queer Black trans politics’ illuminating powers—powers that can help to demystify what conventions of legal and political consciousness represent as happening in the current constitutional and political moment—it seems practically wise for LGBTQ communities to give these politics a broad-based and active witness. If, realistically, the time for that witness may not have quite arrived, it soon may—in that moment of urgency and even crisis, if and when Dobbs comes down as expected, threatening the doctrinal foundations of LGBTQ constitutional rights up on the hill, which seem so likely to foment new, on-the-ground political challenges to established LGBTQ rights. Who has missed some of the more prominent anti-trans and anti-gay ways these challenges have already started heating up?82 As the fire that has been burning in the valley of LGBTQ rights moves up the hill, it may, at last, become clear that queer Black trans politics are in a genealogical line that traces back to the forbearers of today’s LGBTQ communities and the forbearers of race and sex equality rights. At the margins and outsides of normative social life, queer Black trans politics have been being forged in distinctively intense fires of oppression that exist in those social locations. These politics can thus withstand that heat as they chart political pathways forward. Looking ahead to political conflicts within LGBTQ communities whose contours are already possible to discern: As older “white club” LGBTQ politics increasingly experience the temptation to reassert and re-center themselves at the expense of queer Black trans political “freedom-dreaming and visionary world-making,” it will be important to remember that queer Black trans politics require a major flex and deep self-transformation for those inclined to the old LGBTQ political ways. 83 As even some LGBTQ allies who claim solid queer Black trans political 82. See supra note 30.83. JENNIFER C. NASH, BLACK FEMINISM REIMAGINED: AFTER INTERSECTIONALITY 130(2019). 2022] QUEER BLACK TRANS POLITICS 123 credentials have been learning and teaching, these self-transformations are, for many, much easier to think or speak about than to practice and live. The depth of queer Black trans challenges to established “white club” ways of living and doing politics, including identity politics, will, therefore, require repeated reassurances and reminders about what has lately been being gained by efforts that many LGBTQ people and institutions have engaged in, as they have re-centered themselves, their politics, and their identities around pro-trans, and, often separately, around pro-Black LGBTQ politics. The question is whether the comfort and the past successes of the old political ways will again win out over the politics and identities of precarity and location. These politics are hard, but they have queer Black trans liberation—and the liberation of all people—directly in their sights, not as practices of “trickle down” so much as “trickle up” politics. 84 A palpable sense is afoot within the spaces that queer Black trans politics are building. It suggests that LGBTQ communities—like so many others—are facing critical inflection points that will define the futures and freedoms that people in these communities have or lack. Here is Raquel Willis during the 2020 Brooklyn Liberation March, thinking aloud about Black trans lives that have been needlessly and tragically lost before their time, and about all the Black trans spirits that have passed over, prophesying while declaring the realities and dreams of queer Black trans power: “And the reckoning is here. The reckoning is here, y’all.”85 The reckoning is here. Then, looking to the future—the future we all now inhabit and the future that has also yet to arrive—Willis asked a question that must now, in some way, be asked again and again: “So when you leave here today, we might be silent today, but tomorrow we’re not gonna be silent, right?”86 The kind of political reckoning, speech, and action that Willis spoke toward—the inward-looking and outward-facing reckoning that LGBTQ communities now confront—involves both individual and collective 84. On “trickle down” and “trickle up” politics, see, for instance, Duggan, supra note 17, at182–83, and Rob Nichols, An Interview with Dean Spade, Toward a Critical Trans Politics, 14 UPPING THE ANTI: A J. OF THEORY AND ACTION 37, 47–49 (2013).

    "abstract": "Queer Black trans politics offer an important frame for understanding the current constitutional moment. This is a moment in which the Supreme Court’s newly enthroned constitutional originalist project is taking off in ways that have race, sex, sexuality, and trans equality rights in its sights. Thinking with queer Black trans politics—and, in particular, their demands for intersectionality and for centering Black trans lives—this Essay presents a distinctive topology of LGBTQ rights and their intersections with constitutional race and sex guarantees. It considers how a queer Black trans-focused intersectional thinking plays out, including in the context of reproductive rights, and traces how intersectionality isn’t only being used by progressives in pro-racial justice directions, but also by social conservatives in regressive ways that warrant attention in anti-racist circles. After surveying what all this means for the future of LGBTQ legal rights, the Essay concludes by underscoring the stakes—both dangers and opportunities—in the days ahead, as pressures on LGBTQ rights continue to mount in the courts and as struggles for LGBTQ rights increasingly shift to the field of politics. With an eye on those shifts, the Essay closes by calling on LGBTQ communities to attend to queer Black trans politics and their visions with care, resisting the ostensible seductions and comforts that a return to older ways of thinking about and practicing “white club” LGBTQ politics might provide",
