Goldberg Title of Study: Investigating fear: Exploring mediators and moderators of mental health distress among LGBTQ+ communities using the minority stress model Pages in Study:196 Candidate for Degree of Doctor of Philosophy The current study is a secondary analysis examining the role of fear of discrimination and its influence and relationship with heterosexist discrimination, social support, and mental health distress among LGBTQ+ adults in the Deep South. A sample of 500 LGBTQ+ identified adults living across Mississippi completed a comprehensive needs assessment survey tapping into nine life domains. The current study investigated fear of discrimination as a form of rejection sensitivity utilizing the minority stress framework (Meyer, 1995, 2003).   Mediating and moderating influences within the minority stress model were examined using series of regression analysis. Fear of discrimination operated as a mechanism through which discrimination negatively impacts mental health; participants who experienced higher levels of discrimination had greater fear and increased rates of mental health distress in the current study. Family support diminished the impact of discrimination on mental health distress. In other words, LGBTQ+ individuals with higher levels of family support were somewhat protected against the deleterious effects of discrimination and mental health distress. Community-level support, including availability of local LGBTQ+ organizations, networks, and protective policies, did not influence the relationship between discrimination and mental health.   However, decreased levels of community-level support among participants in this sample appeared to negatively impact mental health.   The current study provides new understanding of the stressors surrounding LGBTQ+ individuals lives, particularly with regard to the chronic state of fear experienced by LGBTQ+ individuals. Members of LGBTQ+ communities in the Deep South may experience more intense and chronic fear in daily interactions. Implications for counselors, counselor educators, and researchers are discussed.   Key Words: Minority stress, LGBTQ+, gender, sexuality, discrimination, fear, social support  ii DEDICATION  I wish to dedicate this research to my fellow LGBTQ+ community members navigating live and thriving through circumstances of adversity.

Because of their marginalized identity status, LGBTQ+ individuals often face emotional and mental health struggles (Meyer, 1995; 2003). For example, LGBTQ+ individuals face adversity from multiple facets of society at both personal and structural levels (Dispenza et al., 2016; Doyle & Molix, 2015; Meyer, 1995; Woodford et al., 2014). Discrimination and backlash in schools, workplaces, families, peer relationships, the church, mass media, government, and in neighborhoods and communities provides the context in which LGBTQ+ individuals live their daily lives (Fetner, 2008; Kosciw et al., 2018; Ryan, 2010; Waldo, 1999).  The link between adverse experiences and increased mental health distress for individuals in the LGBTQ+ population is clear (Bostwick et al., 2010; Dean et al., 2000; Mereish et al., 2014). A prominent conceptual approach, the minority stress model (Meyer, 1995), illustrates how negative experiences rooted in stigma can cause negative physical and mental health outcomes (Feinstein et al., 2012; Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Mays & Cochran, 2001). As a result of health disparity, public health scientists and policy makers alike have called for further research that investigates physical and mental health inequalities among LGBTQ+ populations (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2011; Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2011).   2 Statement of the Problem      LGBTQ+ individuals face unique, ongoing stress as a result of society’s attitudes about and toward LGBTQ+ identities (Almeida et al., 2009; Burn et al., 2005; Walls, 2008). The minority stress model (Meyer, 1995, 2003) postulates that unique stressors are present at the interpersonal level in the forms of rejection, harassment, discrimination and even biased language related to LGBTQ+ identities (Szymanski, 2005; Woodford et al., 2014). Furthermore, unique stressors at the institutional level may include lack of legal protections (Balsam et al., 2013). The outcomes resulting from these unique stressors include increased anxiety and depression (Bostwick et al., 2014; Feinstein et al., 2012), fear and worry (Fox & Asquith, 2018), and suicidality and substance use (Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Mereish et al., 2014). The relationship between stress due to stigma and mental health disparity is clear (Flenar et al., 2017; Gonsiorek, 1988; Mays & Cochran, 2001; Meyer, 1995; Szymanski, 2005). However, given progress with regard to LGBTQ+ policy and acceptance, some scientists have called for new examinations of the minority stress model under presumably less oppressive social conditions (Meyer, 2016; Savin-Williams, 2006).   The shifting social environment and greater acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals over the previous ten to fifteen years has prompted researchers to question if and how the minority stress model holds true still today (IOM, 2011; Meyer, 2016). Scholars have observed significant improvements in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals in many parts of the world, mostly in North America, Europe, and South America (Frost et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2011). For example, a 2011 study investigating survey data since 1981 across 52 countries shows that attitudes toward homosexuality have consistently and significantly improved in most countries (Smith et al., 2011). The phrase “the new gay teenager” referring to the different experiences of LGBTQ+  3 youth in this new era suggests that minority stress describes social conditions affecting only past generations of LGBTQ+ individuals: “many of the supposed ill effects of being gay are leftovers from previous generations, who were affected by the cultural and interpersonal stigma and prejudice of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s” (Savin-Williams, 2006, p. 17).           If levels of discrimination and stigma have decreased and even eliminated for some, then minority stress will no longer be a strong determinant of health disparity (Meyer, 2016). However, homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia may be similar to racism and sexism (Walls, 2008), which have been tremendously resistant to social change even in the face of legal protections; yet today, overt racism and sexism are censured in most civilized societies and have existed primarily in less obvious, more covert forms (Barnes & Lightsey, 2005; Fischer & Shaw, 1999). Stigma against LGBTQ+ identities may be less overt and more subtle today than what has been observed and recorded in previous decades. However, even subtle forms of discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals can be damaging (Szymanski, 2009).  Importance of the Study Given the shifts noted in the social environment toward LGBTQ+ communities in some countries, new areas of interest surrounding the minority stress model have emerged: (1) the changing nature of social stigma and prejudice surrounding LGBTQ+ communities; (2) the effects of a changing social environment on lived experiences of members of LGBTQ+ communities; (3) processes of coping and resilience among LGBTQ+ communities in a changing social environment; and (4) the persistence or potential decline of health disparity between LGBTQ+ and cisgender, heterosexual populations (Meyer, 2016). Although there are improvements in social environment related to LGBTQ+ identities (Meyer, 2016; Savin-Williams, 2006), LGBTQ+ individuals have increased stress due to an apparent backslide in  4 LGBTQ+ supportive policy and protections more recently over the past three years (Gonzalez, Pulice-Farrow, & Galupo, 2018; Gonzalez, Ramirez, & Galupo, 2018; Veldhuis et al., 2018).  Some researchers investigating distress among LGBTQ+ individuals since the 2016 presidential election apply a minority stress framework (Gonzalez, Pulice-Farrow et al., 2018; Gonzalez, Ramirez et al., 2018). Indeed, the United States is experiencing a rolling back of protective and inclusive policy for LGBTQ+ communities since 2016 (Reardon, 2019). Findings reveal that LGBTQ+ individuals experience increased and persistent worry and concern related to their LGBTQ+ identities as well as upheaval in family relationships (Gonzalez, Pulice-Farrow et al., 2018; Gonzalez, Ramirez et al., 2018). Historically, research findings suggest that conservative administrations that promote anti-LGBTQ+ issues negatively impact LGBTQ+ individuals (Maisel & Fingerhut, 2011; Riggle et al., 2010; Rostosky et al., 2010; Russell et al., 2011). Additionally, social environment linked to geographic region holds strong implications for LGBTQ+ adjustment and outcomes due to regional ideology and access (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2010; Mallory et al., 2016).   Region and place are important to consider given the correlation between social environment, stigma, and oppression. (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2010; Mallory et al., 2016). For example, sexual minority individuals living in states with fewer LGBTQ+ protective policies are at increased risk for mental health distress, including increased anxiety, dysthymia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009). LGBTQ+ persons living in the South are less likely to have legal protections (Mallory et al., 2016). Furthermore, even beyond geographical region, LGBTQ+ individuals continue to experience prejudice and stigma from religious institutions in many places (Pew Research Center [PEW], 2013). Thus, progress in many areas of North America does not necessarily imply equitable  5 progress unanimously across the nation; regardless of social policy and environment at the national level, LGBTQ+ communities in some regions might face unwavering or increased rates of discrimination resulting in health and mental health disparities (Gonzalez, Ramirez et al., 2018; Meyer, 2016).   Purpose of the Study   Given recent shifts in the social environment surrounding LGBTQ+ communities, further investigations applying the minority stress model are warranted (Gonzalez, Ramirez et al., 2018; Meyer, 2016; Savin-Williams, 2006). Using existing data initially collected for a comprehensive needs assessment of LGBTQ+ identified adults (Pellegrine et al., 2019b), the current investigation examined potential mediating and moderating factors of the minority stress model, specifically attending to the relationships among discrimination, fear of victimization, and mental health. The preceding LGBTQ+ needs assessment was designed to provide broad, general descriptions and needs of LGBTQ+ populations in a Southern state. The current study provides a deeper and more narrow analysis of the body of data collected during the initial, comprehensive needs assessment.    Illuminating the function of hypervigilance and fear as influences of mental health distress among LGBTQ+ individuals may allow scholars, practitioners, and policymakers greater ability to provide aid to these marginalized communities. The current study investigated fear among LGBTQ+ communities that may function as a form of rejection sensitivity shaping the context of everyday life. Types of social support that best diminish fear among LGBTQ+ individuals were also investigated. Fear of victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals may be higher among those living in more rural areas with diminished community support and visible signs of acceptance, such as accepting businesses, LGBTQ+ centers, and displays of pride. Thus,  6 the current study investigates the relationship between structure, fear, and mental health distress among LGBTQ+ individuals, adding to the body of literature demonstrating the impact of social support networks.  Research Questions 1. How does fear of discrimination help explain, or mediate the relationships between: (1) heterosexist discrimination in school; (2) heterosexist discrimination in the workplace; and (3) mental health distress?  Ha: Fear of discrimination will mediate the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress such that increased heterosexist discrimination will be associated with increased fear and increased mental health distress. Ho: Fear of discrimination will have no effect on the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress.  2. How does social support (family and community) affect the strength of, or moderate the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and fear of victimization? Ha: Both types of social support will moderate the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and fear of victimization. Specifically, heterosexist discrimination will not have as large of an effect on fear of victimization for individuals who have higher levels of social support. Ho: Social support with have no effect on the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and fear of victimization. 3. How does social support (family and community) affect the strength of, or moderate the relationship heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress?  7 Ha: Both types of social support will moderate the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress. Specifically, heterosexist discrimination will not have as large of an effect on mental health distress for individuals who have higher levels of social support. Ho: Social support will have no effect on the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress.  Operational Definitions • Chosen Families – networks of chosen kinships organized through strong familial-like bonds with others who identify as LGBTQ+ and their allies, often formed as the result of rejection from biological families of origin (Weston, 1991).  • Cisgender – any individual whose gender identity and expression ‘matches’ their sex assigned at birth; in other words, anyone who is not transgender.  • Community Support – the manner and extent to which communities are inclusive and supporting of LGBTQ+ individuals (Meyer, 2015; Meyer et al., 2008). In this study, community-level support may include visibility of LGBTQ+ others, affirmative businesses and policies, LGBTQ+ community events, and symbols of LGBTQ+ support and inclusion.  • Expectation of Discrimination – anticipated negative societal reaction to personal LGBTQ+ identity in the form of heterosexist discrimination (Meyer, 2003).  • Family Support – includes acceptance and support from family members of their LGBTQ+ relatives and identities (Ryan et al., 2009).   8 • Fear of Discrimination – psychological sensitivity to the possibility of being victimized such as burglarized, attacked, or vandalized including fear of discrimination and social exclusion (Fox & Asquith, 2018).  • Heterosexism – the practice of marginalizing LGBTQ+ identities while praising and normalizing heterosexual orientation. Heteronormative ideals are those that assert that heterosexuality, predicated on the gender binary, is the normal and natural expression of sexuality (Herek, 1990).  • Heterosexist Discrimination – includes unique events that may occur in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals due to heterosexist views held by others. Heteronormative discrimination includes events such as being treated unfairly by strangers, hearing heterosexist slurs, being encouraged to hide or downplay LGBTQ+ identity, and lack of support and protection of individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ (Szymanski, 2009).  • Identity Disclosure – the process of sharing one’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity with others. Throughout the current manuscript, identity disclosure is used interchangeably with the terms coming out and being out. Note, the coming out process is a life-long task, rather than a single event; identity disclosure occurs within and across many domains of life (i.e., workplace, family, public).  • In-group Membership – a social group with which individuals identify, often sharing similar values, experiences, and struggles (Allport, 1954).  • Internalized Homophobia – negative self-regard, whereby LGBTQ+ individuals may attach negative societal views about LGBTQ+ identities to themselves (Meyer, 2003; Szymanski et al., 2008).  9 • LGBTGEQIAP+ -- an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender expansive, queer/questioning, intersex, agender/asexual/aromantic, and pansexual/poly; the shortened acronym (LGBTQ+) will be primarily used throughout this paper. Note, the shortened acronym ‘LGB’ and ‘LGBQ’ will be used to describe research studies that did not include transgender individuals. • Mental Health Distress – describes a range of symptoms and experiences related to mental state well-being. Metal health distress is more expansive than mental illness, which usually includes a mental health diagnosis or disorder.  • Minority Stress – unique psychological pressure experienced by members of minoritized groups in society as a result of stigmatized social status (Meyer, 1995, 2003).   • Rejection Sensitivity – being sensitive to rejection such that an individual may be fearful of and/or expect rejection. Individuals with rejection sensitivity may look for signs of anticipated rejection in others. Rejection sensitivity among LGBTQ+ individuals includes hyper-vigilance of one’s surroundings in anticipation of heteronormative discrimination or victimization (Feinstein et al., 2012).  • Transgender – an umbrella term referring to anyone whose gender identity does not align with sex assigned at birth. Throughout this manuscript, transgender and the shortened version, trans, will be used interchangeably o Gender nonconforming gender nonbinary – denoting an individual whose behavior or appearance does not conform to prevailing and social expectations associated with sex.  o TGNC – an acronym used throughout this manuscript for transgender and gender nonconforming.  10 CHAPTER II REVIEW OF LITERATURE  The current study specifically assessed the role of fear of victimization and expectations of discrimination among LGBTQ+ individuals within a minority stress framework (Meyer, 2003). An investigation of the potential moderating influence of social support networks as protective factors against fear and mental health distress is also included. Shifts over time in the political and social landscape related to LGBTQ+ identities and communities warrants a re-investigation of established relationships between discrimination and mental health distress (Gonzalez, Ramirez et al., 2018; Meyer, 2016). Furthermore, more nuanced studies illuminating factors that may mediate and moderate the relationships proposed within the minority stress framework are desirable (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Szymanski, 2009). Investigating the role of fear in mental health distress among LGBTQ+ individuals provides insight that is currently lacking pertaining to health disparity in LGBTQ+ communities. Additionally, illuminating the impact of social support networks as potential protective factors and sources of positive coping for LGBTQ+ individuals contributes to development of more effective mental health treatment strategies and interventions.  This literature review presents a theoretical framework and research that relates to the current study. An overview of the minority stress model and empirical research illuminating relationships therein are included. Research from the body of literature on fear of crime is presented providing a potential link between the minority stress framework and social  11 investigations of fear of victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals. Finally, a discussion of the moderating roles of family and community-level social supports influencing rates of mental health distress among LGBTQ+ communities are discussed. The regional social environment provides added context to the interpretation and implications derived in the current study. Minority Stress Model Similar to members of other marginalized groups, LGBTQ+ individuals frequently struggle with negative societal attitudes and stigma, often to a greater degree than members of dominant and privileged groups in society (Gonsiorek, 1988; Meyer, 1995, 2003). The concept of minority stress was first introduced in the literature surrounding stress and physical and mental health outcomes in the 1990s; it can be described as psychological pressure experienced by members of minoritized groups in society resulting from stigmatized social status (Meyer, 1995). The words marginalized and minoritized will be used interchangeably throughout this manuscript. Minority stress is the most prominent theoretical model today that explains physical and mental health disparities among LGBTQ+ populations (Garnets et al., 1990; Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Meyer, 2003).  Minority stress has been described as one of the four core perspectives in the study of mental health and health disparities among LGBTQ+ populations (IOM, 2011). Other perspectives in the study of disparity include life course, social ecology, and intersectionality (IOM, 2011). Social contexts characterized by prejudice and stigma predispose LGBTQ+ individuals to greater exposure to burden than cisgender, heterosexual individuals (Meyer, 1995, 2003). This increased stress exposure can lead to adverse physical and mental health outcomes (Meyer, 2015) such as anxiety, depression (Feinstein et al., 2012), suicidality, and substance use (Mereish et al., 2014); thus, hypotheses based on minority stress predict that excess stress leads  12 to increased disorder and disease (Meyer, 1993). However, the relationship between minority stress and increased disparity can be ameliorated by resilience and protective factors (Meyer et al., 2008) such as community involvement (Lambe et al., 2017) and family support (Ryan et al., 2010).  Theoretical Underpinnings and Conceptual Structure  The minority stress model (Meyer, 1995, 2003), originally applied to LGB individuals, is founded upon several social and psychological theoretical orientations (e.g., stress theory intergroup relations, common ingroup identity theory, social stigma and identity, symbolic interaction, and labeling theory). In general, minority stress can be conceptualized as related to the juxtaposition of marginalized and dominant values and resulting conflict within the social environment in which members of marginalized groups function and live (Allport, 1954; Goffman, 1963; Pearlin, 1989). Existing theory (Aneshensel et al., 1991; Pearlin, 1989) describes a form of alienation as an incongruence between individual needs and social structures. For example, the sociological study of stress emphasizes the force of society as a stressor by illustrating how individual values that conflict with the values within societal structures can result in turmoil (Pearlin, 1989). Because dominant culture, social structures, and norms do not typically reflect those of marginalized groups, individuals who hold stigmatized group memberships often experience disagreement between the self and society (Pearlin, 1989). One example of such conflict between dominant social structures and minoritized individuals situated within them is the lack of social institutions that protect LGBTQ+ individuals via public policy (i.e., lack of protections for housing and employment).   Theories of symbolic interaction view the social environment as providing individuals with meaning and organization to their realities and experiences (Stryker & Statham, 1985).  13 Interactions with others are, therefore, crucial for healthy identity development and well-being. The concept of the looking glass self refers to interactions with others as a experiences where individual self-identity develops from interpersonal exchanges and others’ perceptions of self (Cooley, 1910). Symbolic interaction theories, thus, assert that negative regard from others such as stereotypes and prejudice may lead to negative self-regard and adverse psychological outcomes (Stryker & Statham, 1985). Negative self-regard is considered internalized homophobia and heterosexism within the minority stress framework, whereby LGBTQ+ persons may attach negative societal views about LGBTQ+ identities to themselves (Meyer, 2003; Szymanski et al., 2008). Societal reaction theory directly addresses the effects of social stigma and negative social attitudes on stigmatized individuals (Kitsuse, 1962). According to societal reaction, deviance from the norm may lead to labeling and negative reactions from society at large (Kitsuse, 1962). Consequences of negative appraisals can lead to development of adaptive and maladaptive responses that can include mental health symptoms among stigmatized individuals (Link & Cullen, 1990; Scheff, 1974). Similarly, traits due to victimization describe how targets of discrimination and prejudice may respond in a number of ways such as: (1) obsessive self-concerns or focus; (2) avoidant reactions such as withdrawal or denial of group membership; (3) internalized self-hate; (4) enhanced in-group solidarity; and/or (5) social action (Allport, 1954).   Minority stress arises not only from negative events, but from the totality of the minoritized individual’s experience in a dominant society (Meyer, 2003). At the center of this experience is the incongruence between the marginalized individual’s culture, needs and experiences, and the surrounding societal structures. Some underlying concepts and fundamentals of the minority stress model are:   14 In developing the concept of minority stress, researchers’ underlying assumptions have been that minority stress is (1) unique—that is, minority stress is additive to general stressors experienced by all people, and therefore, stigmatized individuals are required an adaptation effort above that required of others who are not stigmatized; (2) chronic—that is, minority stress is related to relatively stable underlying social and cultural structures; and (3) socially based—that is, it stems from social processes, institutions, and structures beyond the individual rather than individual events or conditions that characterize general stressors or biological, genetic, or other nonsocial characteristics of the person or group. (Meyer, 2003, p. 676) Model Structure  The minority stress model structure is based upon a conceptualization of stress indicating a distal-proximal distinction. Stress events occur along a spectrum from external to internal and can impact social conditions and structures surrounding LGBTQ+ individuals’ lives (Meyer, 2003). Distal stressors are those typically defined as objective events and conditions outside of the individual; proximal stressors include personal processes that are subjective and are experienced by individuals through internalizing cognitive processes (Meyer, 1995, 2003). Distal, or external, social attitudes gain psychological importance through cognitive appraisal and become proximal concepts with personal importance. Four processes of minority stress relevant to LGB individuals, from distal to proximal, include: (1) external, objective stressful events and conditions (chronic and acute); (2) expectations of negative events and accompanying vigilance required therein; (3) the internalization of negative societal attitudes; and (4) identity maintenance of minoritized sexual or gender identities (Meyer, 1995, 2003). The current paper is concerned primarily with external events of discrimination and internalization of the social  15 environment manifested as expectations of future negative events accompanied by fear and hypervigilance.  Heterosexist Discrimination  Victimization and prejudice, which are the most distal and explicit sources of minority stress, can interfere with individuals’ perceptions of the world as meaningful and orderly and lead to self-devaluation (Garnets et al., 1990) and psychological distress (Feinstein et al., 2012). Environments characterized by LGBTQ+ discrimination are also often referred to as heterosexist environments (Walls, 2008). Heterosexism is the “ideological system that denies, denigrates, and stigmatizes any non-heterosexual form of behavior, identity, relationship, or community” (Herek, 1990, p. 316). Heterosexist discrimination has become more subtle and less direct in social structures today, not unlike racism and sexism (Herek, 1990). Although less overt, heterosexism continues to remind LGBTQ+ individuals of their lower social status (Burn et al., 2005). Even general, everyday heterosexist events, such as being treated unfairly by strangers and hearing heterosexist slurs, occurring at lower rates can negatively impact mental health (Szymanski, 2009). Heterosexist environments can cause barriers to seeking support (Frost & Meyer, 2009), whereby alternative, negative coping mechanisms may be used, such as substance use or withdrawal (Mereish et al., 2014). A proposed taxonomy of subtle heterosexist discrimination that affects LGBTQ+ individuals includes seven categories: (1) use of heterosexist language (e.g., “that’s so gay,” “faggot,” “sissy,” “dyke”); (2) endorsement of heteronormative or gender-conforming culture or behaviors (e.g., a heterosexual person telling a gay person to “act straight” in public); (3) assumption of a universal LGBTQ+ experience (e.g., stereotyping all trans women as sex workers); (4) exoticization and objectification of LGBTQ+ persons; (5) discomfort or  16 disapproval of LGBTQ+ persons (e.g., a stranger staring with disgust at a gay couple, a family that will not allow their gay child to bring their same-sex partner into the home); (6) denial of societal heterosexism and transphobia (e.g., a coworker telling a trans friend that they are being paranoid when they suspect discrimination); and (7) assumption of sexual pathology or abnormality (Nadal, 2013). These seven types of subtle discrimination affecting LGBTQ+ individuals can occur in any domain of life, such as the workplace, school, family life, media, or the legal system and can have lasting impacts (Nadal, 2013). LGBTQ+ individuals may exhibit a variety of reactions and outcomes when faced with discrimination (Nadal et al., 2011). Although some LGBTQ+ individuals feel strength and empowerment following heterosexist discrimination, others experience negative outcomes such as feeling unsafe, uncomfortable, sadness, shame, anxiety, anger, and frustration (Nadal et al., 2011).   Expectations of Discrimination  Experiences of discrimination and victimization can lead to increased anxiety and hyper-vigilance among stigmatized individuals as they approach societal interactions (Allport, 1954; Goffman, 1963). Individuals belonging to minoritized groups may develop hyper-vigilance in coping defensively as a result of discrimination (Fox & Asquith, 2018; Pachankis et al., 2008); this concept helps to explain the stressful effect of stigma. High levels of perceived stigma leads members of marginalized groups to maintain expectations of rejection, discrimination, and violence in their interactions with dominant group members (Feinstein et al., 2012). Stigmatized individuals experience chronic hypervigilance that is persistently and recurrently evoked in everyday experiences (Meyer, 1995). This hyper-vigilance is also stressful because it requires exertion of significant energy and resources to adapt to expectations of discrimination (Allport, 1954). Learning to hide is described as one of the most common coping strategies among LGB  17 individuals as they must constantly monitor their behaviors in all circumstances from dress to verbal and nonverbal communications (Hetrick & Martin, 1987). The stress experienced by vigilant individuals may lead to generalized fear and mistrust of interactions with the dominant culture.  Resilience and Coping  Members of minoritized groups often respond to prejudice with coping and resilience (Allport, 1954); therefore, marginalized status is not only associated with stress and negative outcomes, but also with important positive coping strategies such as group solidarity and cohesiveness that can serve as resources to protect stigmatized individuals from adverse mental health effects of minority stress (Crocker et al., 1998; Meyer, 2015). According to stress theory, the impact of stress on health is determined by counteracting the effects of stress processes with salutogenic coping processes (Aneshensel et al., 1991). A salutogenic approach focuses on factors that support health and well-being rather than factors that cause disease; thus, a salutogenic model is concerned with the relationship between health, stress, and coping.  Similarly, resilience is an essential component of minority stress; resilience only has meaning in the context of general stress and, therefore, is an essential part of understanding minority stress (Meyer, 2015). Through coming out, LGBTQ+ individuals can learn how to cope with and overcome adverse effects of stress by establishing alternative arrangements of relationships and values (Crocker et al., 1998; Frost et al., 2016). Thus, minority coping can be conceptualized as a “group-level resource, related to the group’s ability to mount self-enhancing structures to counteract stigma” (Meyer, 2003, p. 677). However, whether or not individuals can access and utilize group-level resources within their established communities depends on many  18 factors such as environment, availability, and visibility of resources therein (Eisenberg et al., 2018).   Identity Maintenance Distinguished from general stress, minority stress highlights the relevance of minority identity in the stress process (Meyer, 2003, 2015). Whether or not and to what extent an individual identifies with a sexual or gender minority identity impacts minority stress exposure, coping, and resilience opportunities (Meyer, 2015). Concealing one’s identity, or remaining closeted, may be used as a coping strategy to avoid negative consequences of stigma. For example, some communities of LGBTQ+ individuals may hold more fear and vigilance due to stigmatized identity status if they are surrounded by increased discrimination and prejudicial attitudes. LGBTQ+ individuals have reported concealment of sexual orientation in effort to protect themselves from harm (e.g., being physically attacked or fired from jobs) or out of shame and guilt (D’Augelli & Grossman, 2001). However, this coping strategy can sometimes backfire and cause subsequent stress (Miller & Major, 2000). Concealment of one’s identity often prevents LGBTQ+ individuals from identifying and affiliating with others who hold the same minoritized status (Crocker et al., 1998), impeding the opportunity for positive self-appraisal through relationships with similar others (Meyer, 2015). Conversely, identity disclosure and openness about sexual identity can have positive benefits. Coming out is considered a basic stage in the process of healthy sexual identity formation and development demonstrating acceptance of one’s own sexuality (Sandfort et al., 2006). Three broad categories explain why many LGB individuals choose to reveal their sexual identities: (1) improving interpersonal relationships, (2) enhancing mental and physical health, and (3) changing society’s attitudes (Herek, 1996). For example, choosing to come out allows  19 LGBTQ+ individuals to find LGBTQ+ others and build community and social supports therein (Meyer, 2015). Increased social support is associated with increased emotional support and positive mental and physical health outcomes (Meyer et al, 2008). Furthermore, some LGBTQ+ individuals report choosing to come out to increase visibility of LGBTQ+ communities and normalize their identities (Lasser & Tharinger, 2003).    Extending Minority Stress to TGNC Populations Although the minority stress model was originally conceived as applicable to LGB individuals (Meyer, 2003), additional research extends its application to TGNC populations (Balsam et al., 2014; Hendricks & Testa, 2012). Individuals in the TGNC community also experience high rates of minority stressors, including physical and sexual violence, discrimination, and stigma because of gender status (Clements-Nolle et al., 2006; Kelleher, 2009; Mizock & Lewis, 2008; Testa et al., 2015; Xavier et al., 2005). Large sample studies using survey research conducted with trans communities consistently demonstrates that members of this population report high levels of both physical and sexual violence (Clements-Nolle et al., 2006; Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Xavier et al., 2005). Transgender and gender nonconforming individuals often become estranged from their families, experience rejection from peers, and face societal marginalization (Mizock & Lewis, 2008; Testa et al., 2015). Negative attitudes and feelings toward trans individuals (i.e., disgust, fear, violence, anger) are often self-embodied, leading to internalized transphobia (Human Rights Campaign [HRC], 2019b; National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs [NCAVP], 2016); this can manifest feelings of self-hatred, shame, low self-esteem, and suicidal thoughts among transgender individuals (McCann & Sharek, 2016). Transgender individuals experience significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression (Budge et al., 2013), and substance abuse  20 (Chaney & Brubaker, 2012) than the cisgender population. The rate of suicidality for the trans population is particularly alarming at 40–50% especially when compared to cisgender individuals, who have a suicide attempt rate of about 2% (Flores et al., 2016). Empirical Findings on Discrimination and Minority Stress An ever-growing body of research illustrates the numerous physical and mental health disparities among LGBTQ+ individuals (Cochran & Mays, 2013; Flenar et al., 2017; Garnets et al., 1990; Mereish et al., 2014; Meyer, 1995). The minority stress model asserts that prejudicial events associated with minority status, such as discrimination and stigma, act as stressors in the lives of marginalized individuals, often resulting in increased mental health distress (Meyer, 1995, 2003). One in two LGBTQ+ identified participants in the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) reported experiencing regular discriminatory events in their lifetime (Mays & Cochran, 2001). These discrete events may lead to increased mental health distress manifesting in a variety of ways including increased anxiety and depression (Feinstein et al., 2012), suicidality, and substance use (Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Mereish et al., 2014). Given the higher disproportionate rates of negative mental health outcomes among LGBTQ+ individuals (Mays & Cochran, 2001; Meyer, 2003), understanding and preventing discrimination is vital to curtail such disparities. Scientists also highlight a link between minority stress and physical health disparity among LGBTQ+ individuals (Flenar et al., 2017; McLaughlin et al., 2010) including increased rates of cardiovascular disease (Blosnich et al., 2014) and higher rates of obesity (Conron et al., 2010; Struble et al., 2010). For example, the vascular systems of sexual minority women appear aged (7.5 years) when compared to heterosexual women (Farmer et al., 2013) and, thus, show  21 decreased function. Furthermore, sexual minority women are 2.25 times more likely to meet criteria for obesity than their heterosexual counterparts (Blosnich et al., 2014). In the light of these and other findings demonstrating the link between minority stress and increased disease, the Institute of Medicine (2011) has included the minority stress framework as one of its major frameworks describing health disparity among LGB individuals. This increased focus on the link between minority stressors and health disparity is of interest to public health officials and scientists. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services includes evidence-based health objectives to address health disparities facing sexual minorities in its Healthy People 2020 initiatives (ODPHP, 2011).  Most early research in the area of discrimination and health disparity focused on racial/ethnic and sexual discrimination among men and women of color (Cornely, 1976; Fernando, 1984; Fischer & Shaw, 1999); discrimination based on minority sexual orientation is similarly associated with poor outcomes (Cochran & Mays, 2013; Duncan et al., 2014; Mays & Cochran, 2001). Mental health outcomes associated with extreme forms of discrimination (e.g., hate crimes and other victimization; Herek et al., 1999), and daily stressors (e.g., heterosexist events; Burn et al., 2005) are similarly poor. Both ends of the spectrum of discriminatory events appear to negatively affect mental health among LGBTQ+ groups (Burn et al., 2005; Herek et al., 1999).  A study using data from MIDUS investigated the relationship between experiences of discrimination and mental health indicators among sexual minority adults compared to heterosexual adults (Mays & Cochran, 2001). Study participants reported perceived lifetime and day-to-day discrimination related to school, work, services received, and social environments (Mays & Cochran, 2001). Day-to-day discrimination included less overt forms such as being  22 called names and treated with disrespect (Mays & Cochran, 2001). General effects and mental health indicators were measured to determine prevalence of psychiatric disorder and other negative outcomes as a result of experiences of discrimination (Mays & Cochran, 2001). Findings revealed that sexual minority participants were more likely to report that discrimination negatively impacted their lives; they were also more likely to meet criteria for psychological disorders (Mays & Cochran, 2001). The relationship between sexual identity and mental health outcomes was diminished when discriminatory events were controlled for, suggesting that mental health disparities across sexual orientation groups can be, at least, partially explained by discrimination experiences (Mays & Cochran, 2001).  LGBTQ+ individuals who experienced victimization (verbal or physical) were more likely to report lifetime substance-use problems, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts, demonstrating the link between targeted victimization and symptoms of mental health distress (Mereish et al., 2014). Although substance use problems were a consistent mediator among sexual minority women, they mediated the effects of LGBTQ+ victimization on suicidal ideation, but not on suicidal attempts among sexual minority men (Mereish et al., 2014). Substance use problems were related to three times greater risk of suicide attempt while controlling for victimization (Mereish et al., 2014). Thus, substance use may be a temporary but deleterious coping mechanism among LGBTQ+ individuals who experience victimization based on sexual orientation. Although substances may be used to combat negative feelings and emotions associated with victimization, substance use may also lead to other negative outcomes such as addiction or suicidal ideation and attempt.  Discriminatory experiences can result in substance use and mental health distress highlighting a similar link where increased minority stress is highly related to mental health  23 problems (i.e., depression and anxiety) and substance use (Lehavot & Simoni, 2011). Furthermore, increased discrimination is related to fewer interpersonal and intrapersonal resources and higher rates of mental health distress (Lehavot & Simoni, 2011). In other words, individuals who reported greater levels of victimization also reported less social support (Lehavot & Simoni, 2011), which is a protective factor of minority stress among LGBTQ+ individuals (Meyer, 2015). Thus, increased exposure to discriminatory environments may be a barrier to LGBTQ+ individuals’ contact with important protective factors and coping resources (Lehavot & Simoni, 2011).  Individual and combined effects of discrimination based on race, gender, and sexuality reveal the impact of discrimination by type (Bostwick et al., 2014). Results indicate that among men, gay men encountered the highest rates of discrimination, whereas among women, bisexual women encountered higher rates of discrimination than heterosexual and lesbian women (Bostwick et al., 2014). Individuals belonging to racially/ethnically minoritized groups and identifying as sexual minorities reported the highest rates of discrimination (Bostwick et al., 2014). Interestingly, researchers assert that no single type of discrimination predicts past-year mental health disorder, and discrimination based on gender is the only discrimination type that predicts past-year mental health disorder (Bostwick et al., 2014). Their findings support the conclusion that the relationship between discrimination and mental health is influenced by more than mere quantity of discriminatory experiences and that qualitative distinctions, such as type of discrimination, may be relevant (Bostwick et al., 2014).  Heterosexist language is a contributing factor to the cumulative anti-gay harassment and discrimination many LGBTQ+ individuals face daily (Burn, 2005). For example, indirect suggestion that LGBTQ+ individuals are abnormal or unwelcome may be conveyed through  24 jokes and comments (Burn et al., 2005). In fact, 57% of gay and bisexual men report being called heterosexist names, 52% report hearing antigay remarks from family members, and 43% report being treated unfairly by service workers in the previous year (Szymanski, 2009). However, even when heterosexist language is not used to intentionally harm LGBTQ+ individuals, it may be experienced as perceived harassment or discrimination and contribute to psychological distress (Burn et al., 2005). For example, although participants in one study (Burn et al., 2005) only partially agreed that individuals who make heterosexist comments are likely actually prejudiced, participants reported feeling offended by such comments nonetheless. Furthermore, an increased level of perceived offensiveness was correlated with a decreased likelihood of coming out (Burn et al., 2005), which may pose a barrier to networking and other sources of positive coping for LGBTQ+ individuals (Meyer, 2015).  Discrimination in Schools In schools, LGBTQ+ youth encounter discrimination and harassment related to their minoritized identities (Almeida et al., 2009; Coulter et al., 2016). Schools in the United States, and the institution of education more broadly, often mirror and reproduce inequalities and disparities through heteronormativity and adherence to binary gender systems found in other social systems and greater society (Dessel et al., 2017). Although bullying and physical victimization are problems among youth in general, they are particularly important issues for LGBTQ+ youth (Kosciw et al., 2014). LGBTQ+ adolescents are more likely to experience bullying or physical assault at school than their cisgender, heterosexual counterparts (Kosciw et al., 2014, Kosciw, 2018); much of this assault has been reported as related to students’ sexual orientations and/or gender identities (Kosciw et al., 2018).  25 A growing body of evidence indicates that adolescents who identify as LGBTQ+ are more likely to experience depressive symptoms, anxiety and suicidal ideation, to make suicide attempts, and use alcohol and drugs than cisgender, heterosexual youth (Almeida et al., 2009; Coulter et al., 2016). LGBTQ+ students were more likely to experience victimization and harassment at school than their cisgender, heterosexual peers in a 2014 survey of youth risk behavior (Russell et al., 2014). Due to victimization, perceived discrimination, and expectations of discrimination, LGBTQ+ youth report feeling unsafe at school, which encourages and increases truancy among these students (Russell et al., 2014). Outcomes among LGBTQ+ youth are similar to LGBTQ+ adults, indicating that the theory of minority stress (Meyer, 2003) may be applicable to LGBTQ+ youth.  Anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination can lead to significant negative impacts on the physical, psychosocial, and educational outcomes of LGBTQ+ youth as compared to heterosexual and cisgender peers (Kosciw et al., 2012; 2018). LGBTQ+ students may experience loss of friendships due to their identity (Poteat & Espelage, 2007), and increased victimization such as bullying and physical and sexual assault (Kosciw, et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2014). These forms of victimization are associated with lower self-esteem, lower grade point average (GPA), and higher incidence of truancy among LGBTQ+ students (Kosciw et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2014). Furthermore, due to victimization and lack of support in school, LGBTQ+ adolescents experience increased rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-harm, and alcohol and drug use (Almeida et al., 2009; Coulter et al., 2016). A body of growing evidence (Almeida et al., 2009; Coulter et al., 2016; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014) demonstrates the effects of minority stress among youth in school settings. For example, a study of high school students compared cisgender, heterosexual students to LGBTQ+  26 students on a number of measures including depressive symptoms, indicators of general emotional distress, and perceived discrimination (Almeida et al., 2009). Both LGBTQ+ boys and girls displayed more emotional distress when compared to cisgender, heterosexual counterparts as evidenced by significantly higher prevalence rates of depressive symptoms, self-harm and suicidal ideation (Almeida et al., 2009). Rates of reported self-harm were increased among LGBTQ+-identified boys (Almeida et al., 2009). LGBTQ+ students in this sample also reported perceived discrimination more frequently than did cisgender, heterosexual youth: 31% versus 4%, respectively (Almeida et al., 2009). Among LGBTQ+ students, a significantly larger percentage of LGBTQ+-identified boys (50%) reported discrimination than LGBTQ+-identified girls (25.3%). Students who encountered discrimination on the basis of their LGBTQ+ group membership were significantly more likely to report self-harm, suicidal ideation, and depressive symptomology (Almeida et al., 2009).  National School Climate Survey  The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN; Kosciw et al., 2018) is a national organization working to track and improve trends of LGBTQ+ discrimination and resources in schools across the United States; today, GLSEN is the leading national education organization focused on ensuring safe and affirming schools for LGBTQ+ students. Prior to the year 2000, experiences of LGBTQ+ youth were nearly absent from national studies of adolescents and, thus, GLSEN launched the first National School Climate Survey (Kosciw et al., 2018). Survey data are collected by researchers nationwide every two years in order to track trends and monitor progress. The survey documents the prevalence of anti-LGBTQ+ language and victimization, such as experiences of bullying, harassment, and assault in schools (Kosciw et  27 al., 2018). Analyses of the data also explore outcomes of hostile school environment on LGBTQ students’ well-being and educational attainment.    Findings from the 2017 survey (Kosciw et al., 2018) reveal that the vast majority of LGBTQ+ students hear anti-gay (98.5%) and transphobic (87.4%) remarks at school, with 91.8% reporting feeling distress because of these remarks. Verbal harassment occurs at high rates with 70% of students reporting harassment based on sexual orientation and 59% reporting harassment based on gender expression (Kosciw et al., 2018). Nearly one quarter to one third of LGBTQ+ students report physical harassment (i.e., being shoved or pushed) based on sexual orientation (29%) or gender expression (25%) in the past year (Kosciw et al., 2018). Alarmingly, 57.3% of LGBTQ+ students reported being sexually harassed in the past year at school (Kosciw et al., 2018).   Analyses based on students’ reports showed that LGBTQ+ students face negative outcomes associated with victimization and discrimination in school (Kosciw et al., 2018). Students who experience higher levels victimization and discrimination in school: (1) are more likely to miss school in the previous month; (2) have lower GPAs); (3) are nearly two times as likely to report no plans to attend college; (4) consider dropping out of school; (5) have lower self-esteem; (6) are more likely to be disciplined at school; and (7) show increased levels of depression (Kosciw et al., 2018). Additionally, findings reveal that students who attend schools with more supportive staff, resources, and policies: (1) report feeling more safe; (2) are less likely to miss school; (3) are more likely to report plans to pursue post-secondary education; and (4) have higher GPAs than students in schools with fewer supportive networks (Kosciw et al., 2018).   28 Teens who identify as TGNC report more hostile school experiences than LGBQ cisgender students (Kosciw et al., 2018). For example, 70-85% of TGNC students report experiences of LGBTQ+-related victimization, compared to roughly 36-43% of their cisgender LGBQ peers (Kosciw et al., 2018). While negative remarks related to sexual orientation made by school staff have decreased or shown no change since 2013, negative remarks about gender expression by staff have increased (Kosciw et al., 2018). Trends reveal that homophobic remarks in school are declining but still remain relatively high; the percentage of students who report hearing homophobic remarks frequently or often has dropped from over 80% in 2001 to less than 60% in 2015 and 2017 (Kosciw et al., 2012; Kosciw et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2014). However, 57% still report hearing anti-gay remarks at school by students and staff frequently or often (Kosciw et al., 2018). Outcomes vary across type and location of school; students in religious schools, rural schools; schools in the South consistently report greater hostility and victimization (Kosciw et al., 2018). Similarly, students in rural areas and Southern states are least likely to have LGBTQ+-related resources, supportive policies, and supportive staff in schools (Kosciw et al., 2018).  Supportive School Climate  School culture and climate can reinforce norms of heteronormativity and a binary gender system. Affirmative-LGBTQ+ school climates are characterized by supportive policies protecting sexual and gender minority students, presence of Gay Straight Alliances (GSA) on campus, inclusive school curriculum, increased support from teachers administrators, and other staff, and accessible resources for LGBTQ+ students (Dessel et al., 2017; Kosciw et al., 2018). Overall, investigation of school climate promotes better understanding of the relationships between experiences at school and outcomes among LGBTQ+ youth.   29 LGBTQ+ students who attend schools adopting LGBTQ+-inclusive curricula report feeling safer and experiencing less victimization at school (Kosciw et al., 2012; Kosciw et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2014). LGBTQ+ students also report that seeing safe space stickers (i.e., visible markers identifying locations and/or individuals who are welcoming and affirming) on campus provides greater feelings of comfort and promotes positive conversations among students, teachers, and mental health professionals about LGBTQ+ issues (Kosciw et al., 2018). Furthermore, LGBTQ+ students who have more supportive educators also report greater feelings of safety, less victimization, and lower alcohol use than LGBTQ+ students without support (Coulter et al., 2016).  LGBTQ+ students report increased rates of alcohol and drug consumption related to experiences of discrimination and school climate (Coulter et al., 2016). Data linked from the School Health Profile Survey and YRBS (Coulter et al., 2016) indicate that GLB students report drinking on more days, drinking at school, and drinking heavily significantly more often than heterosexual students; however, analyses reveal that heterosexual, gay and lesbian students who attend schools with more LGBTQ+-affirmative school climates engage in less alcohol consumption than all students attending schools with less affirmative climates (Coulter et al., 2016). Schools with more LGBTQ+-affirmative practices and environments are better for all students and reduce negative behaviors among youth who do and do not identify as LGBTQ+.  Gay-straight Alliances Gay-straight alliances (GSAs) are school-based clubs that aim to provide safe environments for LGBTQ+ youth and their allies. Gay-straight alliances usually exist in high schools and sometimes middle schools when they are present. The presence of GSA as part of school climate is a key strategy to ensure safety, support, and respect for LGBTQ+ youth therein  30 (Heck et al., 2011; Kosciw et al., 2018; Porta et al., 2017). GSAs in high schools reduce mental health issues including depression, suicidality, and alcohol and drug use (Goodenow et al., 2006; Heck et al., 2011; Konishi et al., 2013; Poteat & Espelage, 2007; Poteat et al., 2013). GSAs are also linked to increased sense of safety among LGBTQ+ students as well as lower likelihood of experiencing harassment (Kosciw et al., 2012; Kosciw et al., 2014; Kosciw et al., 2018). Additionally, LGBTQ+ students who attend schools with GSAs are more likely to make plans for attending college (Kosciw et al., 2018) and obtain college degrees (Toomey et al., 2011). One qualitative study investigated LGBTQ+ students’ perceptions of how GSAs contribute to well-being and positive outcomes (Porta et al., 2017). The most prevalent theme found among youths’ interviews was that GSAs provide access to community, including three community oriented benefits: (1) a shared emotional connection and social support therein, (2) a provided a sense of membership and belonging, and (3) fulfilling the needs of community members along the lines of advocacy and activism as well as navigating the coming out process (Porta et al., 2017). GSAs provide youths a gateway to supportive adults, community resources, and the larger LGBTQ+ community (Porta et al., 2017). Importantly, LGBTQ+ youth reveal that the presence of GSAs on campus fosters a sense of safety (Porta et al., 2017). Overall, GSAs serve many positive functions for LGBTQ+ youth and can be an important indicator of a positive school climate (Kosciw et al., 2018; Porta et al., 2017).  Teacher Support Teachers play important roles in influencing and reinforcing school climate (Dessel et al., 2017) by holding authoritative positions in classrooms with the power to develop and shape the language and behavior of students. Teachers also engage with students and other school officials outside of the classroom (i.e., in casual commons areas, during tutoring, and in assembly) to  31 create and enforce school norms in shared spaces. A public school climate survey the United States reveals multiple facets of teacher-student relationships influence both LGBTQ+ and cisgender, heterosexual students’ self-esteem; these facets include use of biased language, public interventions addressing LGBTQ+ bullying, and access to trusted and supportive adults at school (Dessel et al., 2017). Derogatory language in the classroom negatively affects LGBTQ+ students’ self-reported grades (Dessel et al., 2017), suggesting that feeling victimized by teachers may directly impede LGBTQ+ students’ ability to fully engage in classroom learning.  Discrimination in the Workplace  Although LGBTQ+ adults may choose to spend their time outside of working hours with friends and family members who are supportive of their sexual orientations and/or gender identities, few have choice about the attitudes and behaviors of their coworkers (Holman, 2018; Waldo, 1999). Working adults spend about one-third of their lives at work, thus, workplace climate is a substantial and significant aspect of life that can affect functioning both in and out of the workplace (Dispenza, 2015; Ragins et al., 2007; Velez et al., 2013; Waldo, 1999). Furthermore, heterosexism and discrimination in the workplace toward sexual minority individuals is both direct (e.g., anti LGB jokes) and indirect (e.g., assumptions of heterosexuality; Waldo, 1999). The widespread lack of workplace protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in the workplace (HRC, 2019a) underscores the need to extend the minority stress framework to vocational experiences and outcomes (Velez et al., 2013).  LGBTQ+ employees are vulnerable to indirect and direct forms of discrimination and heterosexism in the workplace (Waldo, 1999) from jokes and negative commentary about LGBTQ+ individuals to being passed over for promotions or being terminated (Sue, 2010; Waldo, 1999). One study revealed that 21% of gay men and 13% of lesbians reported that  32 suggestions they made at work were rejected, 14% reported being mocked by colleagues, and 14% remarked they felt their careers had been thwarted because of being gay (Sandfort et al., 2006). Employees have reported experiences of verbal and physical harassment and discriminatory attitudes and comments in their workplaces (Embrick et al., 2007; Herek, 2009). Between 7-41% of LGBTQ+ adults reported physical or verbal abuse in the workplace or having their property vandalized at work (Badgett et al., 2007). Furthermore, 51% of gay and bisexual men reported being treated unfairly by coworkers on the basis of sexuality (Szymanski, 2009). LGBTQ+ employees also reported receiving harassing emails and faxes and hearing anti-gay jokes or comments in their workplaces (Badgett et al., 2007; Velez et al., 2013). Compared with heterosexual employees, lesbian and gay employees report less perceived support from colleagues and fewer positive relationships with supervisors and colleagues (Sandfort et al, 2006).  Workplace Climate  Workplaces vary greatly with regard to LGBTQ+-supportive environments therein; some companies adopt exemplary LGBTQ+ policies and protections while others enforce none. To date, only 22 states and the District of Columbia have nondiscrimination laws protecting sexual minority individuals against discrimination in the workplace (HRC, 2019a). However, there is no federal nondiscrimination law protecting LGBTQ+ employees solely on the basis or sexual orientation or gender identity. A number of organizational practices that are supportive of LGBTQ+ employees include: (1) policy prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation; (2) inclusion of sexual orientation in diversity statements and trainings; (3) offering domestic partner benefits to same-sex employees; (4) public support of LGBTQ+ issues; and (5) a general sense of acceptance such that same sex partners of employees feel welcome at company social  33 activities (Button, 2001; Lim et al., 2019; Ragins & Cornwell, 2001). Each of these factors can create a workplace environment where LGBTQ+ employees feel safe, valued, and supported. The supportive elements in the workplace have significant effects on the experiences of LGBTQ+ employees (Barron & Hebl, 2013; Riggle et al., 2010). For example, the presence of organization-wide anti-discrimination policies are associated with positive sense of self, feelings of increased safety and greater comfort with disclosing LGBTQ+ identity in the workplace (Riggle et al., 2010), as well as reduced reports of discrimination in the workplace (Barron & Hebl, 2013). Identity Management in the Workplace Management of sexual and gender identity at work is linked to fear and expectations of discrimination (Sandfort et al., 2006). Being out, and, conversely, concealing sexual identity mediates the relationship between workplace climate and heterosexist experiences (Waldo, 1999). Employees who are more open with their identity experience more discrimination at work; however, concealment of identity leads to continued vigilance and anxiety, feelings of disconnection and alienation, and lack of support from others (Sandfort et al., 2006). Concealment of identity in the workplace is also linked to job dissatisfaction, increased anxiety in the workplace, and psychological distress (Button, 2001; Velez et al., 2013). Concealment in the workplace may also be associated with increased expectation of rejection and experiences of victimization (Trau & Härtel, 2007). Anticipated negative reactions from work colleagues is correlated with increased mental health distress, decreased job dissatisfaction, less organizational and career commitment, and less workplace participation when compared to individuals with decreased fear of rejection (Dispenza, 2015; Ragins et al., 2007; Velez et al., 2013). Perceived support is also a predictor of concealment or disclosure in the workplace (Ragins et al., 2007).  34 Specifically, perceived support from supervisors and coworkers is associated with increased levels of identity disclosure in the workplace (Ragins et al., 2007).   Three identity management strategies in the workplace include: counterfeiting, avoiding, and integrating (Button, 2004). Counterfeiting refers to presenting false heterosexual identity, avoiding refers to actively evading references to sexual orientation and maintenance of strong boundaries between work and personal life, and integrating refers to openly identifying as LGBTQ+ at work (Button, 2004). Use of counterfeiting and avoiding identity management strategies in the workplace is linked to higher stress and lower job satisfaction among LGBTQ+ employees (Ragins et al., 2007), whereas integrating is linked to positive mental health and vocational outcomes (Ragins & Cornwell, 2001; Waldo, 1999). Heterosexist discrimination in the workplace is associated with both counterfeiting and avoiding strategies as well as expectations of future discrimination and internalized homophobia (Button, 2001; Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Ragins et al., 2007). Thus, workplaces characterized by heterosexist climates can dissuade LGBTQ+ employees from disclosing their LGBTQ+ statuses, resulting in poor outcomes including increased stress, decreased job satisfaction, and increased isolation at work.  Being out at work is not related to experiencing career obstacles or heterosexist experiences, but outness is related to work burnout among gay men (Sandfort et al., 2006). Lesbians report being out at work more often than gay men, and being out is not related to age or living in a suburban versus rural area in this study (Sandfort et al, 2006). Furthermore, gay men with higher levels of education are open about their sexuality work (Sandfort et al., 2006). Gay men who are less open about their sexuality at work experience more symptoms of emotional exhaustion (feeling empty and exhausted at work), depersonalization (feeling distant toward one’s work), and reduced personal competence (feeling less capable at work; Sandfort et al.,  35 2006). Both gay men and women who report emotional exhaustion at work also report more sick leave and diminished health (Sandfort et al., 2006). Thus, lesbians may be out at work more often, and men who conceal their identities at work may experience greater emotional burden than those who do not (Sandfort et al., 2006). Individuals identifying as LGBTQ+ may choose to conceal their identities in the workplace (Button, 2004) as well as other major contexts as a way of coping with discrimination and anxiety associated with ongoing anticipation of discrimination (Meyer, 2003; Ross, 1985).  Expectations of Discrimination  The most proximal stressors in the minority stress model suggest internalization of negative societal attitudes related to minority sexualities and gender identities leading to psychological maladjustment (Meyer, 1995, 2003). One outcome of internalized homophobia is perceived or anticipated negative societal reaction(s); expected reactions reflect the societal meaning of an individual’s LGBTQ+ identity, and mental health distress may arise from the degree of internalization of negative attitudes (Ross, 1985). Thus, the environment in which LGBTQ+ individuals exist regarding associated attitudes and values placed on minoritized sexualities and gender identities is significantly related to the extent of mental health distress experienced by the individual (Feinstein et al., 2012; Ross, 1985). Early research in the area of internalized homophobia demonstrated that actual and expected societal reactions to sexuality status are, indeed, separate constructs, and that expected societal reaction is related to factors of psychological adjustment (Ross, 1985). In a study of two countries with diverse societal attitudes toward LGBTQ+ individuals, distinctions of anticipated societal reaction differed according to social climate (Ross, 1985). Participants from a society with more conservative values regarding LGBTQ+ issues showed increased expectations of  36 rejection among family, friends, and acquaintances (Ross, 1985). Interestingly, analyses confirmed that relationships with close family members may be perceived as separate from societal reaction, and there is likely little difference between actual and anticipated rejection from close family members (Ross, 1985). This finding indicates that the fear of anticipated rejection from family members in particular can be high and as deleterious to mental health as actual rejection by family members. Thus, the importance of family support is implied.           Some studies examining perceived discrimination measure self-reported accounts of discrimination in participants’ lives (Burgess et al., 2008; Mays & Cochran, 2001); however, a distinction must be made between perceived discrimination that has previously occurred and anticipated future discrimination or rejection (Outland, 2016). For example, researchers investigating perceived discrimination have measured lifetime occurrence of discrimination, frequency of day-to-day discrimination, and perceived reasons for discrimination (Mays & Cochran, 2001). However, less research has investigated anticipation or expectation of rejection as a state of hypervigilance and remaining on guard to protect oneself in the possibility of a situation of rejection (Meyer, 2003). Anticipation of rejection, then, includes the anxiety state associated with worrying about rejection; therefore, anticipation of rejection exists whether actual rejection occurs or not (Meyer, 2003; Outland, 2016). Rejection Sensitivity   Objective stressors may lead to the internalization in the form of expectations for future rejection where expectation of rejection moderates the positive relationship between discrimination and mental health distress (Feinstein et al., 2012; Pachankis et al., 2008; Pachankis et al., 2014). Expectations of future discrimination constitute a form of rejection sensitivity whereby sexual and gender minorities anxiously expect to be rejected because of their  37 stigmatized identities (Feinstein et al., 2012). Two existing studies highlight that expectations of rejection specific to sexual orientation can negatively impact mental health outcomes among gay men (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Pachankis et al., 2008) Furthermore, anticipation of rejection can lead to feelings of social anxiety across a broad range of social situations (Pachankis et al., 2008). Lesbians and gay men who experience higher levels discrimination also report increased expectations to experience similar discrimination in the future; expectations of rejection partially explain the relationship between discrimination and mental health outcomes (Feinstein et al., 2012).   Other negative outcomes of anticipated rejection include cognitive-affective issues such as lack of assertive interpersonal behavior, decreased help-seeking, and withdrawal (Pachankis, 2007; Pachankis et al., 2008). For example, gay men may be unlikely to assert their needs in interpersonal situations (e.g., correcting false rumors, responding for rudeness, asking for clarification, approaching others) due to expectations of rejection because of sexual orientation (Pachankis, 2007; Pachankis et al., 2008). Similarly, a sample of African American college students was less likely to seek support and have contact with majority group members when they anticipated rejection (Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002). Anticipated negative evaluation may also lead to motivation to hide or conceal aspects of identity related to stigmatized sexuality and/or gender expression (Frable et al., 1990; Hetrick & Martin, 1987). Concealment of stigmatized identity can create barrier to important protective factors such as systems of community resilience and social support within LGBTQ+ communities (Meyer, 2015; Meyer et al., 2008). Although rejection sensitivity among LGBTQ+ individuals has been described as discomfort (Pachankis & Goldfried, 2006) and anxiety (Pachankis et al., 2008) across various interpersonal situations, no previous research has investigated fear as an expectation of rejection.  38 The body of literature surrounding fear of crime and victimization provides additional context explaining hyper-vigilance and expectations of discrimination among LGBTQ+ communities (Fox & Asquith, 2018).  Fear of Victimization           Although direct exposure to violent or criminal harm can trigger feelings of distress, trauma, and disempowerment, fear of crime, or psychological sensitivity to the possibility of victimization, can function similarly (Farrall & Gadd, 2004). Thus, individuals who have not experienced direct exposure to violent or criminal harm may exhibit perceived fear of crime. Furthermore, direct exposure to victimization and fear of victimization have been linked to negative health and social outcomes (Ross, 2000; Ross & Mirowsky, 2001). Empirical studies investigating fear of crime have been a major area of growth for both academic research and policy initiative since the 1960s primarily among criminologists and criminal justice system professionals (Cossman & Rader, 2011; Hale, 1996; May, 2001).             Social environment and life experiences can profoundly affect individuals’ perceptions of the world. One salient manifestation of the link between individual and society is the perception of personal control over one’s life, including constructs such as fear of crime or victimization, self-efficacy, and locus of control (Bandura, 1978; Mirowsky & Ross, 1991). Fear of crime negatively impacts subjective measures of physical, general, and mental health (Chandola, 2001; Ross, 2000; Ross & Mirowsky, 2001; Whitley & Prince, 2005). While some awareness and concern about crime is positive, such as taking sensible victimization precaution, extreme fear of crime can be counterproductive (Ravenscroft et al., 2002; Ross et al., 2001). Fear of crime may have adverse emotional effects on individuals, provoking feelings of isolation and vulnerability (Ravenscroft et al., 2002; Whitley & Prince, 2005).   39           Fear represents a state of emotional arousal (Bandura, 1978) regarding potential victimization; similar to perceived personal control, fear is also a response to social environment (Ross & Mirowsky; Warr, 1986). Perceptions of risk and assessment of the consequences of victimization are linked to individuals’ feelings concerning community of residence as well as sense of community support of lack thereof (Warr, 1987). Fear, then, can limit personal freedom and increase withdrawal. A behavioral response to fear of crime is avoidance; individuals who worry about victimization may restrict places they visit and reduce time spent outside of the home (Liska et al.,1988; Ross & Mirowsky, 1999; Whitley & Prince, 2005) and mistrust others, resulting in reduced social ties and participation in activities (Ross & Jang, 2000). Furthermore, individuals who are afraid of being victimized change their habits and limit their behavior to perceived safe places and times (Liska et al., 1988; Patterson, 1985). Vulnerability and Fear of Crime  Early work investigating possible correlates of fear focused on two primary factors: (1) vulnerability to victimization (e.g., physical, psychological, economic; Funk et al., 2007; Skogan, 1981) and (2) actual victimization (i.e., level of actual crime and experiences of crime linked to fear or anticipation of crime; Ross & Mirowsky, 2001). Within the context of vulnerability, fear of victimization depends upon: (1) an individual’s exposure to risk; (2) loss of control (i.e., lack of effective defense, protective measures, and/or means of escape); and (3) an assessment of severity of consequences of victimization (Killias, 1990). The interaction between risk and seriousness of consequences, or sensitivity to risk, is critical to produce fear (Warr, 1987, 1990; Warr et al., 1990).  Two types of vulnerability leading to increased fear of crime include social and physical vulnerability (Skogan, 1981). Social vulnerability refers to social support barriers, whereas  40 physical vulnerability refers to neighborhood disorder and physical limitations (Funk et al., 2007; Gibson et al., 2002; Skogan, 1981). Furthermore, vulnerability to crime can be experienced by members of particular disadvantaged social groups who may feel particularly susceptible to criminal victimization (Patterson, 1985; Warr, 1985). Some predictors of fear of crime related to vulnerable group status include gender, age, and poverty (Fisher & Sloan, 2003; Glass et al., 1999; White et al., 1987). For example, the shadow hypothesis asserts that fear of sexual assault among women may cast a feeling of fear looming over all potential types of crime and, thus, generalize fear (Fisher & Sloan, 2003; Wilcox et al., 2006). Continual contact with the idea of sexual harassment sensitizes women to take precautions in social environments. For example, women have a higher sense of sexual vulnerability than men by examining the relationship between socialization processes and fear of crime (Burt & Estep, 1981). Women reported being warned about more situations and events during childhood than men that resulted in greater fear (Burt & Estep, 1981). Perhaps, then, fear among LGBTQ+ individuals functions similarly to women who have been socialized to fear victimization. Fear of crime is also related to physical location and surroundings (Ross et al., 2001; Warr, 1990).  Researchers have explored the relationship between physical location and surroundings and fear of crime (Belyea & Zingraff, 1988; Ross & Jang, 2000; Ross & Mirowsky, 2001;Warr, 1990). For example, a body of evidence suggests that residents of inner neighborhoods of larger cities are more likely to be afraid of victimization than those who live in suburbs and more rural areas (Belyea & Zingraff, 1988; Ross et al., 2001; Ross & Mirowsky, 1999). Furthermore, individuals living in disadvantaged neighborhoods report higher fear of crime and lower physical health well-being; fear of crime accounts for 60% of the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and health outcomes (Ross & Mirowsky, 2001). Proposing a divergent hypothesis,  41 this study asserts that fear of victimization among LGBTQ+ participants will be higher among individuals living in more rural areas due to lack of structural community supports and resources.  Fear of Crime among LGBTQ+ Individuals  Drawing upon previous concepts demonstrating that fear of crime is tied to particular social groups (Fisher & Sloan, 2003; Patterson, 1985; White et al., 1987), it is likely that these variables also contribute to fear of victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals. Individuals belonging to racially/ethnically marginalized groups are three times more likely to feel vulnerable to hate crime victimization than White counterparts (Stohr et al., 2006). Gender and sexually diverse communities experience pervasive heterosexism, and the presence of heterosexist violence often leads LGBTQ+ individuals to continually assess their personal risk for violence, contributing to fear of criminal victimization (Fox & Asquith, 2018). Among marginalized LGBTQ+ communities, persistent high levels of fear and repeat victimization, as well as secondary victimization, lead to habituation of fear. Therefore, members of these communities live with persistent fear of victimization (Fox & Asquith, 2018; Tseloni & Zarafonitou, 2008). Yet, to date, few studies have investigated fear of victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals (Fox & Asquith, 2018; Meyer & Grollman, 2014).   Sexual minorities and women are significantly more likely to report fear of walking in their neighborhoods at night (Meyer & Grollman, 2014). A recent study tested the validity of a Fear of Heterosexist Violence scale (Fox & Asquith, 2018) with participants who identifiy as gender or sexual minorities in Tasmania. The study investigated the relationships between experiences of heterosexist discrimination and violence, level of outness, level of community engagement, and fear of heterosexist violence (Fox & Asquith, 2018). Fear of heterosexist violence is significant among highly victimized LGBTQ+ communities, and that fear of  42 heterosexist violence is likely to be accumulative and increases with age as well as experiences with heterosexism (Fox & Asquith, 2018). Furthermore, participants reported higher levels of fear in domains in which they had experienced previous discrimination or victimization (Fox & Asquith, 2018). For example, participants generally reported higher levels of civil victimization (i.e., discrimination, harassment, hostility, and vilification) than criminal victimization (i.e., physical and sexual assault); likewise, participants reported higher fear of heterosexist violence in the civil domain (Fox & Asquith, 2018). Additionally, the capacity to safely disclose sexual or gender identity and feel community connection may mediate levels of fear (Fox & Asquith, 2018).  Social Support as a Moderator of Distress  Researchers and policy makers have called for an increased investigation of the composition and effects of social support networks among populations at risk for negative mental health outcomes due to social marginalization (Fiori & Jager, 2012; Frost et al., 2016; Meyer, 2016). Certain interpersonal relationships (e.g., supportive parents and friends; Frost et al., 2016; Ryan, 2010), policies (e.g., anti-discrimination school and organizational codes; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009; Kosciw et al., 2018), and supportive organizations (e.g., LGBTQ+ centers and GSAs) provide protection against the deleterious effects of minority-specific stressors (Konishi et al., 2013; Porta et al., 2017). Numerous studies provide evidence for the importance of investigating potential moderating and mediating relationships between discriminatory events and psychological distress (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Szymanski, 2009; Szymanski & Ikizler, 2013). Furthermore, illuminating potential moderating influences allows researchers to understand what circumstances and conditions most strongly predict outcome variables (Frazier, Tix, & Barron, 2004).   43  The minority stress framework suggests the negative relationship between minority stressors and mental health outcomes can be at least partially buffered by positive social support networks and access to resources (Meyer, 2003). However, findings regarding the potential mediating role of social support are mixed; contrary to the minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003), social support showed no mediating effect between discrimination and psychological distress among gay and bisexual men (Szymanski, 2009). Additionally, social support functions as a mediator in the relationship between internalized homophobia and mental health distress for sexual minority women but not men (Kashubeck-West et al., 2008; Szymanski & Carr, 2008). Two types of social support of focus in the current study include family and community-level support.  Family Support  Family support is an important moderator of minority stress among LGBTQ+ individuals, such that positive family acceptance buffers against deleterious mental health outcomes (Hatchel et al., 2019; Rothman et al., 2012; Ryan et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2010). This link is mutually established among LGBTQ+ youth and young adults (D’Augelli et al., 2005; Rothman et al., 2012), suggesting the importance of family support for LGBTQ+ individuals across the lifespan. For example, when LGBTQ+ teenagers disclose their sexual and/or gender identities, they may face a range of responses that either support or reject them (D’Augelli et al., 2005). LGBTQ+ young adults who reported higher levels of parental rejection during adolescence were 8.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, 5.9 times more likely to report high levels of depression, and 3.4 times more likely to engage in risky sexual and drug use behaviors when compared to those from families who reported low or no levels of familial rejection (Ryan et al., 2009). Likewise, LGB adults who felt their parents did not provide emotional and social  44 support after coming out had higher likelihood of experiencing both depression and substance use (Rothman et al., 2012).  In contrast, perceived acceptance from family buffers the impact of perceived rejection on alcohol use among LGBTQ+ youth (Rosario et al., 2009). Family support had a significant positive impact on participants’ self-acceptance of sexual orientation and well-being and a strong negative impact on mental health distress in one study (Shilo & Savaya, 2011). Family support among LGBTQ+ adolescents predicts improved self-esteem, social support, and better general health status, as well as lower rates of depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and attempts in young adulthood (Ryan et al., 2010).  Family acceptance and support are linked to improved life circumstances among LGBTQ+ adults (Snapp et al., 2015). A study of 245 Latino and White LGBTQ+ young adults in the United States suggests that family acceptance is independently associated with increased educational attainment, ability to save money, and job stability (Snapp et al., 2015). Greater family acceptance among participants is also linked to improved self-esteem (Snapp et al., 2015). Among measures of different sources of social support in the study, family acceptance is the only independent significant predictor of both positive adjustment and life circumstance and self-esteem; of note, family acceptance remains a significant factor when other salient forms of social support (such as friends and community-level support) are considered (Snapp et al., 2015). Although the positive association between family support and mental health outcomes is consistently demonstrated (Rothman et al., 2012; Ryan, 2010; Shilo & Savaya, 2011), less is known about other forms of social support and the potential co-influence of various forms of social support on positive coping and adjustment among LGBTQ+ individuals.  45 Community-level Support  The distinction between individual- and community-based resilience is importance in the minority stress framework. Individual resilience is as indicative of personal agency and related to qualities within the individual; however, focus on individual resilience can be hazardous because it can remove or reduce social responsibility to protect disadvantaged populations via efforts such as public policy and initiatives (Meyer, 2015). The concept of community resilience refers to how communities house resources that can help individuals cope with stress such as supportive LGBTQ+ networks, healthcare providers, and legal aid (Fergus & Zimmerman, 2005; Hall & Zautra, 2010). The minority stress model (Meyer, 2003) illustrates how community support and coping resources (i.e., LGBTQ+ social groups, LGBTQ+ social activism) can alter or modify the relationship between minority stress and mental health distress (Meyer, 2015; Meyer et al., 2008).   In the context of minority stress, minority coping and community resilience refers to norms and values, role models, and opportunities for social supports (Frost et al., 2016; Nesmith et al., 1999). LGBTQ+ youth in the United States view community support as related to socializing, having access to LGBTQ+ information and resources, and findings networks in LGBTQ+ communities (Nesmith et al., 1999). Participation within an LGBTQ+ community and having a psychological sense of connectedness therein can ameliorate the impact of negative minority stress (D’Augelli & Hart, 1987; Frost & Meyer, 2012; Kertzner et al., 2009). These specific characteristics of minority coping (e.g., socializing, access to resources, and networking) suggest a unique role for non-familial support from other LGBTQ+ individuals.   When stigmatized individuals are in the presence of others experiencing similar stigma, psychological well-being is improved (Frable et al., 1998). However, little is known about the  46 extent to which LGBTQ+ individuals seek support from members of their sexual minority communities. LGBTQ+ individuals often form chosen families, or fictive kinship networks with other LGBTQ+ individuals as a result of rejection from biological families of origin (Weston, 1991). Chosen families are organized through strong familial-like bonds with others who identify as LGBTQ+ and their allies and, therefore, understand living in an environments characterized by minority stress and limited by heterosexist opportunity structures (Weston, 1991). The support of similar others who make up chosen families may be sought through participation in spaces with high concentration and visible presence of other LGBTQ+ individuals (e.g., LGBTQ+ organizations and inclusive spaces; Frost et al., 2016).    Specific support provided by other in-group members is likely important throughout development across the lifespan when LGBTQ+ individuals face unique challenges (Frost et al., 2016). For example, having similar others available for support, advice, and role models can be helpful to adolescents and young people in the process of coming out, which is essential in reducing potential internalized homophobia and positive identity development (Elizur & Ziv, 2001; Jordan & Deluty, 1998). Increased legal recognition of same-sex relationships and family formations implicate the importance of support of and advice from other same-sex couples in negotiating challenges therein (Frost, 2011; Frost & Meyer, 2009; Leblanc et al., 2015). Social support with similar others may be important among LGBTQ+ older adults who have historically been locked out of traditional pathways to family formation and, thus, may have less family support and children (Barker et al., 2006).   Access to supportive community is also related to disclosure of sexual minority status, or coming out (D’Augelli et al., 2005; Elizur & Ziv, 2001). Although some community resources, such as changes in law and policy, reach everyone regardless of the extent to which they identify,  47 many resources require the individual to actually access them (Meyer, 2015). In other words, in order to activate such resources, the LGBTQ+ individual must tap into the community to reap benefits of minority resilience at the community-level. It is more difficult for LGBTQ+ youth and adults who are not out to find and access supportive communities, presenting a barrier to specific in-group protective factors (Meyer, 2015; Meyer et al., 2008).  Findings regarding the impact of community-level support for LGBTQ+ individuals are mixed. One study of LGBTQ+ young adults investigated the potential impact of three community-level supports: (1) involvement in LGBTQ+ events, (2) frequency of attending gay bars and clubs, and (3) frequency of reading LGBTQ+ publications and media (Snapp et al., 2015). The only positive association among three community-level supports was that participants who reported reading LGBTQ+ books and magazines also reported higher self-esteem (Snapp et al., 2015). However, these findings may be impacted by individual personality and identity difference rather than community-level support (Snapp et al., 2015). For example, seeking LGBTQ+-specific reading materials may be more likely related to individual factors. Similarly, attendance at gay bars and clubs may capture individuals already battling greater mental health and substance use issues where those individuals may engage in negative coping rather than benefitting from positive aspects of community networks.  According to theories of social stress and mental health, “high levels of disorder among certain groups can be attributed to their extreme exposure to social stressors of limited access to ameliorative psychosocial resources” (Aneshensel & Phelan, 1999, p. 12). In other words, disenfranchised groups may also experience barriers to access various resources and protective factors, such as community support, because of structural barriers. One study tested this hypothesis with a mixed race sample of LGB and heterosexual participants in New York and  48 found mixed results for the theorized model (Meyer et al., 2008). LGB participants in the study were exposed to higher levels of acute stress and prejudicial life events than their heterosexual counterparts (Meyer et al., 2008). Findings regarding Black and ethnic minority LGBs were explicit and consistent with social stress predictions; across a variety of measures, Black and Latino LGBs were exposed to more stress and had fewer available coping resources (i.e., community support networks) than White participants. Thus, the need for intersectional analyses are warranted in investigations of the minority stress model and models of social stress (Meyer et al., 2008). LGBTQ+ in the Deep South  The geographic area where the current study takes place is of crucial importance in both informing the study at every stage of development as well as adequately interpreting results. The current study is situated in a very particular regional context, the Deep South, which is laden with meaning, barriers, and ways of being that are unique to region. The Deep South, also frequently referred to in the literature as “the Bible Belt,” includes the states of Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, and Florida (Barton, 2012; Peirce, 1974). Although the Deep South is often used in history books to refer to the seven states that originally formed the Confederacy, in its broadest application, it is considered to be a region roughly corresponding with the old cotton belt and historic areas of cotton plantations and slavery (Peirce, 1974). The histories in these states and region have created a specific political and moral ideology that is inextricably linked to the area still today.    Individuals living in the Deep South have more strongly opposed LGBTQ+ individuals and homosexuality for decades (Black & Black, 1987; Greenberg, 1988). Survey research from the early 1980s revealed that “respondents from the South, from small towns, and rural areas  49 who were poorer and less educated were more likely to think homosexuality morally wrong and to oppose gay rights” (Greenberg, 1988, p. 468). Despite attitudinal shifts toward greater acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights in the United Sates since the 1990s, the Deep South continues to stand out as a region marked by widespread and heavy opposition toward these issues (Rogers, 2019). Over one third (34%) of Christians in the Deep South identify as evangelical Protestant, compared to only one fourth (25%) of Christians in the United States as a whole (PEW, 2014).  In particular, Mississippi is one of the most religiously and politically conservative states in the nation where the number of Christians who identify as evangelical Protestant is 41%, higher than any other state in the nation. Sociologists and other social science researchers argue that attitudes specific to conservative evangelical Christianity in the Bible Belt create and maintain a homophobic atmosphere and status quo (Barton, 2012; Fetner, 2008; Howard, 1997; Rogers, 2019). The conservative religious ideology constructs behaviors and ways of being among LGBTQ+ community members as an abomination, which influences social attitudes of those in the region (Barton, 2012; Fetner, 2008; Howard, 1997). Furthermore, the power exercised by Christian institutions and Christians within secular institutions across the Deep South serve as a foundation for both passive and active homophobia infiltrating multiple environments where residents socialize, work, and live (Barton, 2012; Howard, 1997). Everyday settings are saturated by Christian messages, crosses, music, news, and attitudes.   Similarly, this ideology has a powerful influence on city, county, and state political institutions as well (Barton, 2012). For example, in the 1950s and 1960s “public policy makers and clergy were often one in the same, and law enforcers and administrators regularly cited biblical injunctions as justification for their actions” (Howard, 1997, p. 8); this is still occurring in areas across the Deep South today. One recent example of this backlash is House Bill 1523  50 (HB 1523), whereby the Governor of Mississippi Phil Bryant signed legislation that legalized the discrimination of LGBTQ+ individuals in the state. HB 1523 “Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination” writes anti-LGBT religious beliefs and moral convictions into state law and not only grants discrimination from religious organizations, but also individuals, businesses, and state employees. Governor Bryant, who signed the bill stated that HB 1523 was designed to protect religious beliefs and moral convictions from discriminatory action by state government (Margolin, 2016).  Institutional authority figures in the Deep South who are openly opposed to LGBTQ+ communities enforcing homophobic policies and practices affect how individuals and communities perceive and treat LGBTQ+ individuals (Barton, 2012). Likewise, these environments affect how comfortable or uncomfortable LGBTQ+ individuals living in these areas feel being openly LGBTQ+. Thus, many LGBTQ+ individuals residing in the Deep South learn to either stay in the toxic closet or come out and expect homophobic and oppressive attitudes towards themselves and their communities (Barton, 2012). This directly relates to the concept of expectations of discrimination as explained by the minority stress model, where LGBTQ+ individuals who live in discriminatory environments learn to anticipate rejection and discrimination in their everyday lives and encounters (Meyer, 1995, 2003). Mississippi is a particularly interesting and important site to study LGBTQ+ individuals’ experiences of oppression and discrimination as well as resilience and strength.   The distinct combination of conservative religiosity and politicism, as evidenced by bills and laws such as HB 1523, make Mississippi an excellent context in which to explore LGBTQ+ individuals’ lives. In a series of regional qualitative interviews and focus groups from a recent LGBTQ needs assessment in Mississippi, participants unanimously described the theme of living  51 with fear on a daily basis (Pellegrine et al., 2019a). Fear emerged as one of three dominant themes where participants across multiple groups and regions of Mississippi described feelings of paranoia and anxiety resulting from adverse experiences or expectations of adverse experiences (Pellegrine et al., 2019a). Understanding the influence of fear as well as strategies of coping and resilience among LGBTQ+ individuals living in Mississippi, a state notorious for unrelenting oppression and discrimination, will be valuable to practitioners and scholars working with LGBTQ+ communities affected by any level of discrimination.   Current Study  Heteronormative discrimination has deleterious effects on LGBTQ+ individuals’ mental health (Balsam et al., 2014; Bostwick et al., 2014; Mays & Cochran, 2001). Research inquiry concerning heteronormative discrimination in specific contexts such as school (Almeida et al., 2009; Coulter et al., 2016; Russell et al., 2014) and workplace (Dispenza et al., 2016; Velez & Moradi, 2012) has similarly established negative mental health outcomes as a result of contextualized discrimination as well as the positive effects of supportive school and workplace climate (Kosciw et al., 2018; Riggle et al., 2010). Furthermore, LGBTQ+ individuals may experience expectations of future discrimination and fear as a result of experiences of discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ communities (Feinstein et al., 2012; Pachankis, 2007; Ross, 1985). Rejection sensitivity occurs among LGBTQ+ individuals who have been rejected and expect similar rejection to occur again in the future; however, these studies have investigated only feelings of anxiety and discomfort across a range of social situations (Feinstein et al., 2012; Pachankis, 2007; Pachankis et al., 2008). To date, no empirical study has investigated fear of being victimized because of LGBTQ+ identity as an expectation of rejection  52 using a minority stress framework. I argue that fear also functions as a form of rejection sensitivity among LGBTQ+ individuals, shaping the context of everyday life.   Social scientists from sociology and criminal justice have asserted that fear of victimization encompasses sensitivity to risk which is an interaction between risk and severity of consequences of victimization (Warr, 1990; Warr et al., 1990). However, whereas rejection sensitivity and expectations of discrimination as discussed in the model of minority stress presume to require previous discriminatory experiences (Meyer, 2003), fear of victimization is not necessarily precipitated by actual previous experiences with discrimination or victimization (Farrall & Gadd, 2004). Given the disproportionate rates of victimization and hate crimes against LGBTQ+ individuals and communities at large (Duncan et al., 2014; Herek et al., 1999), I argue that rejection sensitivity among LGBTQ+ individuals may not necessarily require previous direct experiences of discrimination. I also hypothesize that fear mediates, or helps explain, the relationship between discrimination and mental health distress among LGBTQ+ individuals in this study. Illuminating the function of fear as an influence of mental health distress among LGBTQ+ individuals may allow scholars, practitioners, and policy makers greater ability to provide aid to these marginalized communities.  Although previous research (Frost et al., 2016; Snapp et al., 2015) examined the protective factors provided by social support and supportive communities, an area of study that warrants more attention is how social supports can diminish expectations of rejection and discrimination. The family and larger community are both systems in which identity is negotiated, supported, and contested in everyday life. However, family support and community-level support may provide different types and amounts of protection from and buffering against  53 negative emotionality. The current study illuminates specific types of social support that best diminish fear among LGBTQ+ individuals. Finally, the body of literature on fear of crime related to physical location and community  has largely established that fear of crime is higher among individuals who live in more densely populated inner cities as opposed to more rural areas (Ross & Mirowsky, 1999; 2001). However, I argue that fear of victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals may be higher among those living in more rural areas where there is less community support and fewer visible signs of acceptance, such as affirming businesses, LGBTQ+ centers, and displays of pride. One study investigating fear of heterosexist victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals shows a relationship between fear and decreased social connectivity, resulting in less social interaction and smaller social networks (Fox & Asquith, 2018). Community visibility and support, then, may have a positive impacts on reducing fear of victimization and expectations of rejection among LGBTQ+ individuals. Thus, the current study investigates the relationship between structure, fear, and mental health distress among LGBTQ+ individuals, adding to the body of literature demonstrating the impact of community-level supports. 54 CHAPTER III METHODOLOGY Participants  Participants in this study included LGBTQ+-identified adults living in Mississippi in October and November of 2018. A total of 999 respondents initiated the survey. Respondents were excluded from the study if they failed to meet the inclusion criteria; eligible respondents must: (1) identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or any other sexual or gender minority status; (2) live in the state of Mississippi at the time of taking the survey; and (3) be at least 18 years of age. Surveys with more than 15% missing data were also eliminated from the final data sample. A total of 500 eligible participants completed the entire online survey. To date, this constitutes the largest dataset of LGBTQ+ Mississippians.    The age of respondents ranged from 18 to 75 years with a mean reported age of 35.4 years; 24.4% (n = 122) 18–24 years, 31.6% (n = 158) 25–34 years, 19.6% (n = 98) 35–44 years, 13.4% (n = 67) 45–54 years, and 11.0% (n = 55) 55 years and older. Participants were able to endorse as many sexuality and/or gender identity labels as they felt were applicable. Among the entire sample, 36.0% identified as lesbian, 56.2% identified as gay, 30.8% identified as bisexual, 9.8% identified as transgender, 33.0% identified as queer, and 16.6% identified as some other sexual or gender minority identity category. The reported gender of participants in the study were 54.9% women, 40.2% men, and 4.8% nonbinary.    55  The participants were 81.8% Caucasian, 7.9% African American, 8.1% multiracial, and 1.2% ‘other’ race or ethnic category. Survey respondents reported residing in 51 of the 82 counties in Mississippi, with dense clustering in Hinds, Rankin, Oktibbeha, Harrison, and Forrest counties. The spread of household income across the sample approached a normal distribution, with 26.7% who reported annual household income between $25,000 and $49,000 and an additional 25.2% who reported annual household income between $50,000 and $99,000. The majority of participants (61%) reported being employed. Furthermore, 31.3% of respondents in the original study indicated living at or below the poverty level; these numbers are about on par for reported household income for the general population of adults living in Mississippi (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). The overall sample reported a relatively high level of education, with 52.4% who reported completion of four-year degrees or higher. See Table 1 below for full demographic information.    Procedure  The current study is a secondary analysis of original needs assessment data; this research was deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board (see Appendix B). Thus, the procedures described herein were employed for the original data collection efforts. The sample for this study was derived using an electronic web-based survey distributed to a convenience sample of LGBTQ+-identified Mississippians. Graphics were created which included the study logo and information to access the survey online. These graphics were approved by the IRB and displayed on the study website, social media websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, business cards, and stickers (note, the study website has been converted to a domain housing findings from the survey data under the LGBTQ Fund of Mississippi). Participants were recruited through targeted social media advertisement, membership lists of participating LGBTQ+ groups  56 in Mississippi, and via in-person recruitment at LGBTQ+ events around the state in October and November of 2018. Another researcher and I attended a total of five LGBTQ+-targeted events in Mississippi during the study period; events were held in Jackson, Starkville, Tupelo, Hattiesburg, and Biloxi. Researchers also promoted the survey link through the study’s website and Facebook page. Sponsored advertisements were posted to targeted audiences in Mississippi via Facebook. In addition, initial respondents were asked to share the survey link with anyone they knew who may be interested in and would qualify for the study.  The original study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for research with human subjects. All individuals who initiated the survey were provided a consent prompt prior to responding to any survey items. Participants were informed that continuing with the survey after the consent page indicated agreement to participate in the research study. Each individual who initiated the survey was first provided screener items; those who did not meet inclusion criteria were thanked for their time and notified of their exclusion due to falling outside of the study inclusion criteria. The majority of individuals who initiated the survey but did not meet criteria were under the age of 18 or declared themselves as cisgender, heterosexual allies of the LGBTQ+ communities.       57 Table 1  Demographics of Study Sample  (N) % Age       18-24 (122) 22.4      25-34 (158) 31.6      35-44 (98) 19.6      45-54 (67) 13.4      55+ (55) 11.0 Sexuality & Gender Identity       Lesbian (180) 36.0      Gay (281) 56.2      Bisexual (154) 30.8      Transgender (49) 9.8      Queer (165) 33.0      Other SGM* (83) 16.6 Gender       Woman (268) 54.9      Man (198) 40.2      Nonbinary (16) 3.3 Race       Caucasian (409) 82.8    58 Table 1 (continued)  (N) %      African American (39) 7.9      Multiracial (40) 8.1      Other (6) 1.2 Household Income      <10,000 – 14,999 (69) 15.1      15,000 – 24,999 (74) 16.2      25,000 – 49,999 (122) 26.7      50,000 – 99,999 (115) 25.2      100,000 – 199,999 (69) 15.1      200,000+ (8) 1.4 Education       Some HS (3) 0.6      HS diploma or GED (32) 6.4      Some college or vocational program (125) 25.2      Associate’s degree (2 yr) (76) 15.3      Bachelor’s degree (4 yr) (130) 26.2      Master’s degree (87) 17.5      Doctorate or professional degree  (43) 8.7 Note.

The entire survey included 91 items and was comprised of nine domains: (1) neighborhoods and communities; (2) physical health; (3) mental health; (4) workplace; (5) school and education; (6) religion; (7) family; (8) safety and legal; and (9) demographics. The survey was designed for the purposes of gathering data about the needs and challenges facing LGBTQ+ adults living in Mississippi. Data collected using items and constructs from five domains were selected to investigate the research questions in the current study: (1) mental health; (2) workplace; (3) school and education; (4) family; and (5) safety and legal. Table 2 presents the summary of descriptive statistics of the dichotomous items used in the current study, and Table 3 presents the summary of descriptive statistics of the Likert-type items used in the current study.    60 Table 2  Summary of Dichotomous Item Descriptive Statistics Item  N % Yes % No 1.

Factor analysis is commonly used in order to establish construct validity and explore the dimensionality of a measurement scale of multiple items (Hair, 2010). For the current study, two separate maximum likelihood factor analyses were conducted with oblique (PROMAX) rotation. Two separate EFAs were conducted because of the type of data and items used and the capabilities of statistical software used; SPSS statistical software cannot handle dichotomous, binary items for conducting an EFA (IBM, 2018). Thus, the first EFA was completed with only items with dichotomous/binary outcomes using Mplus statistical software, which can successfully conduct EFA using dichotomous binary items (Muthen & Muthen, 1998-2020). A second EFA was carried out using categorical items on a Likert-type scale with SPSS statistical software (IBM, 2018). The results of each EFA is presented separately below.  The first analysis included 17 binary items and yielded a 3-factor solution with eigenvalues over Kaiser’s criterion of 1 (Kaiser, 1960). Three factors were retained after examining the salient factor loading of each item (see Table 4). This 3-factor simple structure used 100% of the original 17 items. The fit statistics for the 3-factor model included several statistics; [χ2 (1, 88) =136.561, p < .01, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) =.033, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = .053] met adequate levels indicating acceptable model fit (McCaullaum et al., 1996). Additionally, the 90% confidence interval (C.I.) of the RMSEA = .022, the comparative fit index (CFI) = .994, and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = .991. Table 5 presents the factor correlations as well as the initial eigenvalues and the internal consistency reliability (Kuder-Richardson 20; KR-20) of each factor.    64 Table 4  Factor Loadings of EFA1 for 17 Items  Item Factor Loadings F1 F2 F3 2.

The scree plot was ambiguous and showed inflections justifying retaining 2 or 3 factors. Two factors were retained after examining the salient factor loading of each factor. This 2-factor simple structure explained 57.3% of the variance in the observed variables, used 8 (80%) of the original 10 items. Two items were dropped from community support due to negative factor loadings. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure verified the sampling adequacy for the analysis, KMO = .861; Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity provides an approximated Chi-Square value (χ2 (45) = 1364.977, p < .001). Finally, the communalities were all above .3 (see Table 6 for factor loadings and communalities), further confirming that each item shared some common variance with other items. Table 7 presents the factor loadings after rotation of each factor, as well as the initial eigenvalues, percent of variance explained, and the internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of each factor.     67 Table 6  Factor Loadings & Communalities Cased on EFA2 for 10 Items  Item Loadings Communality F4: Community F5: Family 18.

These six items tap into the construct of discriminatory workplace environment which encompasses both direct and indirect events of discrimination in the workplace. The factor Discrimination in the Workplace corresponds with the construct of discrimination events as proposed within the minority stress model (Meyer, 1995, 2003). The items that make up the scale Discrimination in the Workplace in the current study include: (1) I was told not to let other people know I am LGBTQ+; (2) I heard people say mean things about LGBTQ+ people in general; (3) I was left out or made fun of by my coworkers; (4) my supervisor criticized me for being LGBTQ+; (5) I did not get a raise or promotion because I am LGBTQ+; and (6) I was left out of other professional opportunities because I am LGBTQ+. Participants responded yes or no to each item in order to capture the presence or absence of each indicator. Each response was coded (yes = 1; no = 0), and an average score was obtained for each participant. The resulting scale yields a possible range of scores from 0-1, whereby higher scores indicate increased Discrimination in the Workplace.  69 Fear of Discrimination The second factor (F2) from EFA model 1 contained 7 items and yielded an internal reliability score at an acceptable level; KR-20 =.865. These seven items tap into the construct of fear of discrimination which encompasses fear of being victimized via a spectrum of events including violent and everyday events of discrimination. The factor Fear of Discrimination corresponds with the construct of expectations of discrimination as proposed within the minority stress model (Meyer, 1995; 2003). The items that make up the scale Fear of Discrimination in the current study include: (1) experiencing physical violence; (2) experiencing verbal harassment; (3) experiencing discrimination in a public setting; (4) having property stolen or vandalized; (5) being treated rudely; (6) being socially excluded; and (7) being denied service by a private business. Participants responded yes or no to each item in order to capture the presence or absence of each indicator. Each response was coded (yes = 1; no = 0), and an average score was obtained for each participant. The resulting scale yields a possible range of scores from 0-1, whereby higher scores indicate an increase in Fear of Discrimination. Discrimination in High School The third factor (F3) from EFA model 1, with a KR-20 of .809, indicating good internal reliability, contains 4 items. These four items tap into the construct of discriminatory school environment which encompasses indirect heterosexist discrimination and heterosexist characteristics in the school setting. The factor Discrimination at School corresponds with the construct of discrimination events as proposed within the minority stress model (Meyer, 1995, 2003). The items that make up the scale Discrimination at School in the current study include: (1) adults said mean things about LGBTQ+ people in general; (2) sometimes in class, there were discussions about LGBTQ+ issues that were upsetting to me; (3) a health or sex education class  70 taught that same-sex attraction was wrong; (4) a class other than health or sex education taught that same-sex attraction was wrong. Participants responded yes or no to each item in order to capture the presence or absence of each indicator. Each response was coded (yes = 1; no = 0), and an average score was obtained for each participant. The resulting scale yields a possible range of scores from 0-1, whereby higher scores indicate increased discrimination in the school context. Community-level Support  The first factor from EFA model 2 (F4), with a Cronbach’s alpha of  = .826, consisted of 6 items. The six items tap into the construct of community-level support which includes supportive elements such as community organizations and events, visibility, as well as opportunities for networking with other LGBTQ+ individuals. The factor Community Support corresponds with the construct as proposed within the minority stress model which includes opportunities for creating support networks and healthy identity development (Meyer, 1995, 2003). The items that make up the scale Community Support in the current study include: (1) amount of LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations or other LGBTQ+ nonprofits; (2) seeing same sex couples or families living openly; (3) seeing transgender individuals living openly; (4) amount of businesses that are publicly supportive of LGBTQ+ individuals; (5) seeing pride flags or other symbols of LGBTQ+ inclusion; and (6) amount of pride events or other LGBTQ+ community events. Response options include never (coded 0), rarely (coded 1), somewhat often (coded 2), or very often (coded 3), and an average composite score was obtained for each participant. The resulting scale yields a possible range of scores from 1-4, whereby higher scores indicate more supportive elements at the community level.   71 Family Support The second factor from EFA model 2 (F5), with a Cronbach’s alpha  = .791 indicating fair to good internal reliability, consisted of 2 items. The two items tap into the construct of family support and encompass quality of family relationship and level of family acceptance/support of LGBTQ identity. The factor Family Support corresponds with the construct of social support as proposed within the minority stress model (Meyer, 1995; 2003). The items that make up the scale Family Support in the current study include: (1) “How would you rate your relationship with your immediate family?”; and (2) “How supportive are members of your immediate family around LGBTQ+ issues?” Response options for item one, quality of relationship, include poor (coded 1), fair (coded 2), good (coded 3), very good (coded 4), and excellent (coded 5). Response options for item two, level of support for identity, include not at all supportive (coded 0), not very supportive (coded 1), somewhat supportive (coded 2), and very supportive (coded 3). An average composite score was obtained for each participant. The resulting scale yields a possible range of scores from 1-5, whereby higher scores indicate increased family support.  Kessler 6 Scale Item Psychological Distress Scale  The Kessler 6 Scale (K6; Kessler et al., 2003) was developed for use in large epidemiologic surveys to measure prevalence of serious mental illness (SMI). The six-question scale was developed explicitly to estimate the prevalence of SMI as defined by US Public Law (PL) 102-321, the Alcohol Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) Reorganization Act (Kessler et al., 2003; Kessler et al., 2010). The definition of SMI as put forth by PL 102-321 requires an individual to have at least one twelve-month DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) disorder as well as serious impairment in day-to-day living. The  72 K6 (Kessler et al., 2002) asks respondents to think about the previous thirty days and to self-report how frequently they experienced the following six symptoms: nervousness, hopelessness, restlessness or fidgetiness, worthlessness, depression, and feeling that everything is an effort. For each item, a value of zero (none of the time), one (a little of the time), two (some of the time), three (most of the time), or four (all of the time) were assigned to the response given. Responses to the six items are summed to yield a K6 score between 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater probability of serious mental illness. The body of empirical studies that have utilized the K6 (Kessler et al., 2002, 2003) is extensive and includes studies in both general population and clinical samples for monitoring health trends (Kessler et al., 2010), screening for mental disorders (Baggaley et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2008), and intervention outcome measures (Slade et al., 2011). The K6 scale (Kessler et al., 2003) is the most widely used screening scale of SMI in a number of large ongoing health tracking surveys carried out in the USA and Australia as well as large needs assessment surveys carried out in Europe and Asia (Furukawa et al., 2003; Kessler et al., 2002; Kessler et al., 2003; Kessler et al., 2010). The K6 (Kessler et al., 2002) measure has also been used and assessed by the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) survey initiative which includes population data for the scale in a total of twenty-six countries around the world.  The K6 (Kessler et al., 2003) was developed using modern psychometric methods to maximize precision in the clinical range of the population distribution. Item response theory (IRT) was used to evaluate the contribution of each item to the sensitivity of the total scale in the severity range of the distribution (Kessler et al., 2002). Items selected for inclusion measure reached maximum precision at the clinical threshold around the 90–99th percentile range of the general population distribution (Kessler et al., 2002, 2010). The scale has demonstrated excellent  73 internal consistency and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89; Kessler et al., 2002). Independent clinical validation studies revealed that the K6 (Kessler et al., 2003) has very good agreement with blinded clinical diagnoses of SMI in general population samples and very good discrimination (AUC of 0.85) between respondents with SMI and those who did not meet criteria for SMI. Validation studies measuring the K6 (Kessler et al., 2003) adequacy against structured diagnostic interviews have likewise demonstrated very good sensitivity (i.e., a test’s ability to correctly classify those with disease; true positive rate) at 0.36 and excellent specificity (i.e., a test’s ability to correctly classify those without disease; true negative rate) at 0.96, with a total classification accuracy of 0.92. Finally, analyses have shown that the K6 (Kessler et al., 2002, 2003) significantly outperforms other similar screeners such as the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short-Form (CIDI-SF), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS).  Studies utilizing the K6 (Kessler et al., 2003) as a measure of prevalence of SMI suggest using the optimal cutoff scores provided by the authors whereby K6  13 in order to equalize false-positive and false-negative results; participants scoring K6  13 very likely have SMI marked by at least one diagnosed disorder and decreased function. More recently, researchers (Prochaska et al., 2012) have provided an additional cut-point using the K6 to identify moderate mental distress defined as necessitating mental health treatment and causing impairments in functioning. Based on the consistency in the optimal cut-point finding for the full sample and different racial/ethnic groups in the study, moderate mental distress was defined as 5  K6  13. While 8.6% of adults met criteria for SMI, and another 27.9% met criteria for moderate mental distress based on the cut-points of K6  13 and 5  K6  13, respectively. Analyses revealed that these groups differed significantly on number of visits to a professional in the previous 12  74 months for problems with mental or emotional health; SMI M = 6.9, Moderate mental distress M = 1.8, and none or low mental distress M = 0.4. The likelihood that a physician recommended treatment for emotional distress was 30.2% among participants identified as SMI versus 11.6% among those with moderate mental illness. These groups also differed significantly on impairment items associated with work performance, household chores, social life, and physical health indicators. The additional cut-point allows for identification of populations experiencing mental distress at a moderate of sub-threshold level that may still warrant clinical attention and health policy interventions (Prochaska et al., 2012). Data Analysis Plan  The data analysis for this study primarily involved regression analyses to identify mediating and moderating influences in the minority stress model (Hair et al., 2010). The mediating effect of fear was analyzed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2018), using a three-step causal model and examination of direct and indirect effects to test each relationship. Research question one question asked, “How does fear of discrimination help explain, or mediate the relationships between: (1) heterosexist discrimination in school; (2) heterosexist discrimination in the workplace; and (3) mental health distress?”. The PROCESS method includes a successive three-step analysis that: (1) confirms the significance of the relationship between the initial predictor variable and outcome variable (X → Y); (2) examines the relationship between the predictor variable and the mediator (X → M); and (3) confirms the insignificance or meaningful change in influence of the relationship between the initial predictor variable and the outcome variable in the presence of the mediator. Finally, bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals corresponding with the provided indirect effect reveal the significance or insignificance of the mediator variable among the relationships under study. I proposed one  75 hypothesis for this research question: fear of victimization mediates the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress such that increased heterosexist distress is associated with increased fear and increased mental health distress.  Research question two asked, “How does social support (family and community) affect the strength of, or moderate, the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and fear of discrimination?” A four-step approach in which several regression analyses are conducted and significance of the coefficients is examined at each step was utilized (Baron & Kenny, 1986). First, three simple regresses analyses were conducted to establish zero-order relationships among the variables: (1) the effect of X (heterosexist discrimination) on Y (fear of victimization); (2) the effect of X (heterosexist discrimination) on M (social support); and (3) the effect of M (social support) on Y (fear of discrimination). Finally, multiple linear regression analyses including the effect of X (heterosexist discrimination) and M (social supports) on Y (fear of discrimination) were conducted. One hypothesis was proposed for research question two: both types of social support moderate the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and fear of victimization. Specifically, heterosexist discrimination does not have as large of an effect on fear of victimization for individuals who have higher levels of social support.   Research question three asked, “How does social support (family and community) affect the strength of, or moderate, the relationship heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress?” The four-step approach (Baron & Kenny, 1986) used for research question was similarly applied for question three, however, mental health distress was used in place of fear of victimization for these regression analyses. One hypothesis was proposed for research question three: both types of social support moderate the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress. Specifically, heterosexist discrimination does not have as large of an  76 effect on mental health distress for individuals who have higher levels of social support. The hypothesized model for the research questions under investigation is displayed in Figure 1 below.  Figure 1. Hypothesized conceptual model.  77 CHAPTER IV RESULTS The current study was conducted as a follow-up, secondary analysis using data from a statewide needs assessment of LGBTQ+ adults living in Mississippi. Specifically, the current study sought to unearth the impact of fear of discrimination among the negative relationship between contextual discrimination and mental health outcomes. The moderating or alleviating impact of social support (community-level and family) among these relationships was also investigated. The mediating and moderating effects of fear of discrimination and social support, respectively, were examined using multiple linear regression analysis. The overarching purpose of this study was to investigate the role of fear as an expectation of discrimination using the minority stress model (Meyer, 1995, 2003).  Descriptive Statistics and Preliminary Analysis I began my analysis with an overview of descriptive statistics for each measure and variables including means, standard deviations, and maximum and minimum values for each variable included in the study. Table 8 below provides descriptive statistics of and correlations between measures utilized in this study.  Participants’ scores on the K6 measure, indicating potential risk for severe mental illness (SMI), ranged from 0 to 24, with increased mental health distress corresponding to higher scores. The mean score on the K6 measure among this sample was M = 9.02 (SD = 5.78). The mean score of 9.02 is below the threshold cutoff of 13, indicating that the average score among all K6  78 scores in this sample does not meet threshold for risk of potential SMI. However, it is noteworthy that 28.4% (n = 140) participants in the current study did yield a score of 13 or greater, indicating risk for potential SMI. This rate is alarmingly high, especially when compared to rates of SMI in the general adult population; approximately 4.2% of adults over 18 in the general population of the United States meet criterial for SMI (National Institute of Mental Health [NAMI], 2017). This implies that participants in the current sample are six times more likely to meet criteria for SMI than the general population of adults.

Support = community support; Fam Support = family support. ** p <.01  Participants’ scores on the scale measuring Fear of Discrimination in the current study ranged from 0 to 1, with scores closer to 1 indicating increased fear. The mean score of Fear of Discrimination among this sample was M = .70 (SD = .33). Investigating each item of the Fear scale individually showed that over 50% of participants reported fearing discrimination, harassment, or violence due to their LGBTQ+ identity on all but one item of the scale. Table 9 below shows the frequency and percentage of participants responding ‘Yes’ to each individual item of the Fear measure.    80 Table 9  Percentage of Participants Responding ‘Yes’ to Items Related to Fear of Discrimination  Item % responding ‘Yes’  I feel the need to keep my Identity private due to fear of…   N ‘Yes’ % ‘Yes’ Being treated rudely.   422 86 Discrimination in a public setting. 387 80 Verbal harassment.  380 78 Being socially excluded.  380 78 Being denied service by a private business. 311 64 Physical violence. 269 56 Having property stolen or vandalized. 225 47  Discrimination in High School was measured by averaging the sum of scores on four items where the minimum score obtained by participants in this sample was 0 and the maximum score was 1. Scores closer to 1 are indicative of higher levels of discrimination in participants’ high school environment. The mean score for Discrimination in High School among this sample was M = .57 (SD = .38). Discrimination in the Workplace was measured by averaging the sum of scores across 7 items where the range of scores among participants in this sample was a low of 0 to a high of 1. Similar to Discrimination in High School, scores closer to 1 indicate higher levels of discrimination in participants’ workplace. The mean score among participant’s scores in this sample for Discrimination in the Workplace was M = .32 (SD = .26). Taken together, this might  81 indicate that participants’ high school environments were characterized by discrimination to a greater extent than their workplaces.  Levels of Community-level and Family Support were measured by averaging the sum of scores across 6 and 2 items, respectively. Scores for participants’ levels of Community-level Support ranged from a low of 1 to a high of 3.83 with a mean score of M = 2.11 (SD = .64). Scores representing level of Family Support among participants in this sample ranged from a low of 1 to a high of 5 with a mean of M = 2.59 (SD = 1.09). Higher scores indicate increased level of support on both measures of social support. Of note, the highest score for Community-level Support obtained by participants in this sample, 3.83, is lower than the potential maximum score of 4; this indicates that no participants in the sample felt that their communities offered maximum or optimal levels of Community-level Support in the form of LGBTQ+ inclusive spaces, organizations, and friendly businesses.    Preliminary analyses also included further investigating participants’ responses to the items related to Fear of Discrimination (see Figure 2), which reveal interesting differences in levels of fear by various demographic groupings. Simple bar graphs were created in SPSS to investigate level of participant fear by age, race, place of residence, and gender identity. These graphs indicate that younger participants reported increased levels of fear than older participants. Interestingly, Black and African American participants reported lower levels of fear than did White respondents, but all other non-White respondents reported higher levels of fear than White and Black respondents in this study. Generally, respondents living in more rural areas of the state reported higher levels of fear when compared to respondents living in less rural areas of the state. Regarding gender identity and fear, women in the sample reported the lowest levels of fear, followed by men, and nonbinary respondents. The graphs below in Figure 2 depict these  82 differences across groups. Further statistical testing should be carried out in order to ascertain whether observed differences are statistically different.   Figure 2. Simple bar graphs of fear by demographic groups.  Assumptions and Transformations The validity and statistical integrity of any multiple linear regression application is dependent upon a few underlying assumptions about the nature and spread of scores among the variables under study. As such, each outcome variable was checked for normality at the  83 univariate level by investigating Q-Q plots, histograms, box plots, and skewness of each. Each of the outcome variables in the current study appeared to be significantly non-normal.  The spread of scores on the K6 measure are positively skewed, which was expected given the fact that most people do not meet criteria for severe mental illness. In other words, I expected that most participant’s scores would fall on the lower end of the K6 Scale. However, to correct this skewness for the purposes of linear regression analysis application, several transformations were attempted. A square root transformation when applied to the K6 measure appeared to correct for this issue best, according to Q-Q plots and histogram. Other transformations, including log and inverse transformations, resulted in extreme outliers that were not previously present, as evidenced by box plots associated with each transformed variable spread. Thus, the square root transformed K6 variable was used for all subsequent analyses; likewise, all tables and figures hereafter include the square root transformed K6 variable. The spread of scores on the measure, Fear of Discrimination, were slightly negatively skewed, indicating higher levels of fear among all participant scores. However, all attempted transformations with Fear of Discrimination resulted in the appearance of extreme outliers and increased skewness. Thus, the Fear variable was retained without transformation for each subsequent analysis. At the multivariate level, variables were examined for homoscedasticity, or homogeneity of variance among participant scores. Each independent variable was plotted against each dependent variable, separately, in order to investigate homogeneity of variance among variable pairs. All but one of the plots of variable pairs yielded acceptable results indicative of homoscedasticity. Specifically, a scatterplot of the dependent versus independent residuals showed homoscedasticity for each variable. Furthermore, simple scatterplots of each pair of variables (see Figures 3 and 4 below) yielded nice rectangular shapes indicative of  84 homoscedasticity. Similarly, all variable combinations yielded plots indicating multivariate normality, barring one combination discussed below.    Figure 3. Simple scatter plots of K6 scores by predictor variables.  One of the variable pairs did not yield acceptable results, indicating heteroscedasticity and multivariate non-normality. Specifically, investigating plots of Fear by Discrimination in the Workplace (see Figure 4.D below) revealed less variance in scores toward the lower end of each scale. In other words, the spread of scores resemble a funnel shape (Figure 4.D), indicating that  85 both variables may be skewed. An attempt to correct this issue was implemented by investigating the normality of Discrimination in the Workplace at the univariate level. Indeed, the Q-Q plot, histogram, and box plots revealed a positive skew among the spread of scores for Discrimination in the Workplace. Various transformations were applied to the variable, Discrimination in the Workplace, in attempt to correct for this issue. Although none of the transformations resolved the skewness completely, a Log 10 transformation of Discrimination in the Workplace improved skewness the most. Thus, all analyses hereafter were run using the Log10 transformed workplace variable; likewise, all tables and figures hereafter include the Log10 transformed workplace variable.  86  Figure 4. Simple scatter plots of fear of discrimination by predictor variables.  Finally, all variable combinations appeared linear enough for the intended statistical application as evidenced by scatterplots. Additionally, no multicollinearity among variable pairs was detected as evidenced by correlations among variables below .70 (see Table 8) and variance inflation factor (VIF) scores below 10. Of note, all correlations were significant at the p < .01 level except the correlation among Discrimination in the Workplace and Community-level Support.   87 Mediation Analysis of Research Question 1 RQ1: How does fear of victimization and discrimination help explain, or mediate the relationships between: (1) heterosexist discrimination in school; (2) heterosexist discrimination in the workplace; and (3) mental health distress?  The mediating effect of Fear was analyzed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2018), using a three-step causal model and examination of direct and indirect effects to test each relationship. At Step 1 of the mediation analyses, models 1a and 2a test whether the predictor variables, contextual Discrimination (Workplace and High School), predict Mental Health Distress. Step 2 of the analysis sequence, Models 1b and 2b, examine if the predictor variables, contextual Discrimination (Workplace and High School), predict the mediator variable, Fear. Models 1c and 2c add the mediator, Fear, to the baseline models (1a and 2a) in order to demonstrate the effect of Fear on the relationships between Discrimination and Mental Health. In essence, the changes observed between the baseline models (1a and 2a) and Step 3 models (1c and 2c) reveal the potential mediating effects of Fear among the established relationships between Discrimination and Mental Health Distress. The results of the models are presented in Table 10 below. Finally, bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals corresponding with the provided indirect effect reveal the significance or insignificance of the mediator variable among the relationships under study. Two separate analyses were run for investigating the mediating role of fear between the predictor variables, Discrimination in the Workplace (Models 1a-c) and Discrimination in High School (Models 2a-c) and the outcome variable, Mental Health Distress. Results from these regression models are evident across six models (see Table 10), which, taken together, demonstrate the effect of Fear on the relationships among contextual Discrimination and Mental Health Distress.   88 Table 10  Analyses for Mediating Effects of Fear of Discrimination   K6 Scores Fear  M1a M1c M2a M2c M1b M2b  b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) Wk Discr. 3.71 (.31)*** 2.31 (.19)**   1.55 (.37)***  Fear  .90 (.31)***  .84 (.28)***   HS Discr.   .99 (.39)*** .68 (.26)***  .37 (.43)*** R2 .09 .17 .15 .21 .14 .18 F 35.84*** 36.66*** 51.80*** 40.14*** 56.73*** 67.15*** Note. HS Discrim. = discrimination in high school; Wk Discrim. = discrimination in the workplace; Fear = fear of discrimination.   *p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.  In Step 1, Model 1a of the mediation model showed that the influence of Discrimination in the Workplace on Mental Health Distress, ignoring the mediator, was significant (ß = .31, Fchange in R2 = 35.84, p < .001). Model 1b revealed that the effect of Discrimination in the Workplace on the mediator, Fear of Discrimination, was also significant (ß = .37, Fchange in R2 = 56.73, p < .001). Step 3 of the mediation analysis (Model 1c) showed that the mediator, Fear, had a significant effect on Mental Health Distress when controlling for Discrimination in the Workplace (ß = .31, Fchange in R2 = 36.66, p < .001). Model 1c also revealed that the effects of  89 Discrimination in the Workplace on Mental Health Distress was decreased when controlling for Fear of Discrimination (ß = .19, p < .001). In other words, Fear of Discrimination partially mediated the relationship between Discrimination in the Workplace and Mental Health Distress. Tests of the significance of the indirect effects (see Figure 5, path ab1) indicated that Discrimination in the Workplace yielded significant positive influence on Mental Health Distress partially through the mediating role of Fear of Discrimination; path ab1 ß = 1.39, SE = .30, Bias Corrected (BC) 95% CI [.83, 2.06]. Additionally, this observed indirect effect accounts for approximately 38% of the total effect of Discrimination in the Workplace on Mental Health Distress. In other words, Fear of Discrimination accounts for 38% of the influence of Discrimination in the Workplace on Mental Health Distress.  The sequence of analyses investigating the mediating role of fear between Discrimination in High School and Mental Health Distress was very similar to Steps 1-3 described in Models 1a-c, above. In Step 1, Model 2a of the mediation model showed that the influence of Discrimination in High School on Mental Health Distress, ignoring the mediator, was significant (ß = .39, Fchange in R2 = 51.80, p < .001). Model 2b revealed that the effect of Discrimination in High School on the mediator, Fear of Discrimination, was also significant (ß = .43, Fchange in R2 = 67.15, p < .001). Step 3 of the mediation analysis (Model 2c) showed that the mediator, Fear, had a significant effect on Mental Health Distress when controlling for Discrimination in High School (ß = .28, Fchange in R2 = 40.14, p < .001). Model 2c also revealed that the effects of Discrimination in High School on Mental Health Distress was decreased when controlling for Fear of Discrimination (ß = .26, p < .001). In other words, Fear of Discrimination partially mediated the relationship between Discrimination in High School and Mental Health Distress. Tests of the significance of the indirect effects (see Figure 5, path ab2) indicated that  90 Discrimination in High School yielded significant positive influence on Mental Health Distress partially through the mediating role of Fear of Discrimination; path ab2 ß = .31, SE = .07, BC 95% CI [.19, .45]. Additionally, this observed indirect effect accounts for approximately 31% of the total effect of Discrimination in High School on Mental Health Distress. Thus, Fear of Discrimination causes 31% of the total negative influence of Discrimination in High School on Mental Health Distress. Summary of Findings The hypothesis for RQ1 was supported; Fear of Discrimination partially mediates the influence of Discrimination in the Workplace and of Discrimination in High School on Mental Health Distress. Generally, increased Discrimination leads to increased Fear and increased Mental Health Distress. Similarly, increased Fear leads to increased Mental Health Distress. In other words, the negative influence of contextual discrimination on mental health distress occurs partially through the function of fear of being discriminated against on the basis of LGBTQ+ identity. Implications of these findings will be more fully addressed in the Discussion section. Moderation Analysis of Research Question 2 RQ2: How does social support (family and community) affect the strength of, or moderate the relationship between heterosexist discrimination and fear of victimization?  Moderation models test whether the prediction of a dependent variable, fear of discrimination, from an independent variable, discrimination in context, differ across different levels of a third moderator variable, social supports. Moderator variables affect the strength and/or direction of the relationships between predictor and outcome variables by reducing, enhancing, or changing the nature of the influence of the predictor variable (Fairchild &  91 MacKinnon, 2009). Thus, the hypothesis for RQ2 states that the moderator variables, Community-level and Family Support, will diminish the effects of Discrimination on Fear of Discrimination. Moderation affects are commonly tested with multiple regression analysis using interaction terms in order to examine the effect of the hypothesized moderator variable (Aiken & West, 1991).  For this analysis, I used hierarchical regression to test the moderation model by creating interaction terms for each predictor and moderator pair, whereby I multiplied the score of each predictor Discrimination variable (High School and Workplace) by the score of each moderator variable (Community-level and Family Support) separately. Thus, four initial interaction terms were created for this analysis sequence ([1]HS Discr. x Fam support, [2] Wk Discr. x Fam Support, [3] HS discr. x Comm Support, and [4] Wk Discr. x Comm Support). Examining the baseline model, with no interaction term, against a model including the created interaction term illuminates the nature of the moderating variable under study. Prior to creating interaction terms, each variable was centered in order to correct for multicollinearity. Centering requires subtracting the sample mean from each independent variable, resulting in adjusted variables with a mean of zero and an unchanged sample distribution (Aiken & West, 1991). Additionally, models which revealed a significant moderating effect prompted additional subsequent regression analyses, whereby high and low interaction terms (i.e., interaction terms including the constant predictor variable with a re-centered moderator at plus [low] and minus [high] one standard deviation) were created in order to further examine the nature of the moderating effect. In sum, each relationship under study included the following analyses: (1) a baseline model with no interaction term, (2) a model including the interaction term, and if a moderating effect was  92 found, (3) a simple slopes analysis including two additional models including high and low interaction terms in order to deduce the nature of the moderating effect.  The first set of models in this moderation analysis, Models 5-b (see Table 11), examined the effect of Family Support on the relationship among the predictor variable, Discrimination in the Workplace, and the outcome variable, Fear of Discrimination. The baseline model, Model 5a, examined both Discrimination in the Workplace and Family Support as predictors of Fear. In this model, both variables were found to be significant predictors of Fear; R2 = .18, Fchange in R2 = 39.10, p < .001. (see Table 11, Model 5a). The interaction model, Model 5b, revealed a significant moderating effect of Family Support; the interaction term (Discr. in the Workplace x Family Support) was significant; R2 = .19, Fchange in R2 = 27.95, p < .001. (see Table 11, Model 5b). The significance of the observed moderating variable prompted two subsequent analyses, Model 5b Low and model 5b High (see Table 11). Two new interaction terms were created: (1) Discrimination in the Workplace x Low Family Support and (2) Discrimination at Work x High Family Support, and added to the baseline model, separately. The outcomes of these two models reveal the moderating effect of Family Support; the trends therein show that as Family Support increases, the relationship between Discrimination in the Workplace and Fear of Discrimination decreases. For example, the standardized beta for Discrimination at Work in Models 5a and 5b (see Table 11) is (ß = .34, p < .001), whereas these coefficients increase with lower levels of Family support (ß = .44; p < .001) and decrease with higher levels of Family Support (ß = .21; p < .001).    93 Table 11  Regression Analyses for Moderating Effect of Family Support on the Relationship Between Discrimination in the Workplace and Fear  Fear of Discrimination  Model 5a Model 5b Model 5b Low Model 5b High Predictor b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) Work Discrim. .11 (.34)*** .11 (.34)*** .14 (.44)*** .08 (.24)*** Fam.

Work Discrim. = discrimination in the workplace; Fam. Support = family support; Wk x FS = interaction of discrimination in the workplace and family support.    *p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.   Models 6a-b (see Table 12) examined the effect of Family Support on the relationship among the predictor variable, Discrimination in High School, and the outcome variable, Fear of Discrimination. The baseline model in this series, Model 6a, examined both Discrimination in High School and Family Support as predictors of Fear of Discrimination. In this model, both variables were found to be significant predictors of Fear; R2 = .21, Fchange in R2 = 38.8, p < .001. (see Table 12, Model 6a). The interaction model, Model 6b, revealed a significant moderating effect of Family Support; the interaction term (Discr. in High School x Family Support) was significant; R2 = .22, Fchange in R2 = 27.82, p < .001 (see Table 12, Model 6b). The significance of the observed moderating variable prompted two subsequent analyses, Model 6b Low and model 6b High (see table 12). Two new interaction terms were created: (1) Discrimination in High School x Low Family Support, and (2) Discrimination in High School x High Family Support,  94 and added to the baseline model, separately. The outcomes of these two models reveal the moderating effect of Family Support; the trends therein show that as Family Support increases, the relationship between Discrimination in High School and Fear of Discrimination decreases. For example, the standardized beta for Discrimination in High School in Models 6a and 6b is (ß = .38, p < .001), whereas these coefficients increase with lower levels of Family Support (ß = .50; p < .001) and decrease with higher levels of Family Support (ß = .26; p < .001).

The third set of models in this series of analyses, Models 7a-b (see Table 13) examined the effect of Community-level Support on the relationship among the predictor variable, Discrimination at Work, and the outcome variable, Fear of Discrimination. The baseline model in this series, Model 7a, examined both Discrimination at Work and Community-level Support as predictors of Fear of Discrimination. In this model, both variables were found to be significant predictors of Fear; R2 = .17, Fchange in R2 = 35.38, p < .001 (see Table 13, Model 7a). The  95 interaction model, Model 7b, revealed no moderating effect of Community-level Support; the interaction term (Discr. at Work x Community-level Support) was not significant, but both single predictors remained significant; R2 = .17, Fchange in R2 = 23.67, p < .001 (see Table 13, Model 7b). Thus, Model 7b revealed that an increase of one standard deviation in Community-level Support (ß = -.18; p < .001) resulted in a decrease in Fear by .18 standard deviations.

Model 8a-b (see Table 13), the final moderation model in the series, examined the effect of Community-level Support on the relationship among the predictor variable, Discrimination in High School, and the outcome variable, Fear of Discrimination. The baseline model in this series, Model 8a, examined both Discrimination in High School and Community-level Support  96 as predictors of Fear of Discrimination. In this model, both variables were found to be significant predictors of Fear; R2 = .19, Fchange in R2 = 34.77, p < .001 (see Table 13, Model 8a). The interaction model, Model 8b, revealed no moderating effect of Community-level Support; the interaction term (Discr. in High School x Community-level Support) was not significant, but both stand-alone predictors remained significant; R2 = .19, Fchange in R2 = 23.55, p < .001 (see Table 13, Model 8b). Thus, Model 8b revealed that an increase of one standard deviation in Community-level Support (ß = -.11; p < .001) resulted in a decrease in Fear by .11 standard deviations. Summary of Findings The hypothesis for RQ2 was partially supported. Analyses revealed the moderating effect of Family Support on discrimination in both contexts (High School and the Workplace). There is an overall positive effect of Discrimination on Fear, however the effect is larger for individuals with lower levels of Family Support as compared to those with higher Family Support. However, the hypothesis that Community-level Support moderates Fear was not supported; the effect of Discrimination on Fear holds constant across different levels of Community Support. Implications of these findings will be more fully addressed in the Discussion section. Moderation Analysis of Research Question 3 RQ3: How does social support (family and community) affect the strength of, or moderate the relationship heterosexist discrimination and mental health distress?   A very similar sequence of analysis was carried out in order to examine Research Question 3 as was used in the previous series of moderation analyses. The hypothesis associated with RQ3 states that the moderator variables, Community-level and Family Support, will  97 diminish the effects of Discrimination on Mental Health Distress. Four initial interaction terms were created for this analysis sequence: (1) HS Discr. x Fam support, (2) Wk Discr. x Fam. Support, (3) HS Discr. x Comm. Support, and (4) Wk Discr. x Comm. Support. Interaction models which revealed a significant moderating effect prompted additional subsequent regression analyses, whereby high and low interaction terms (i.e., interaction terms including the constant predictor variable with a re-centered moderator at plus [low] and minus [high] one standard deviation) were created in order to further examine the nature of the moderating effect. In sum, each relationship under study included the following analyses: (1) a baseline model with no interaction term, (2) a model including the interaction term, and if a moderating effect was found, (3) a simple slopes analysis with two additional models including high and low interaction terms in order to deduce the nature of the moderating effect.  The first set of models in this moderation analysis, models 9a-b (see Table 14), examined the effect of Family Support on the relationship among the predictor variable, Discrimination in the Workplace, and the outcome variable, Mental Health Distress. The baseline model, Model 9a, examined both Discrimination at Work and Family Support as predictors of mental health distress. In this model, both variables were found to be significant predictors of Mental Health Distress; R2 = .18, Fchange in R2 = 38.92, p < .001 (see Table 14, Model 9a). The interaction model, Model 9b, revealed no moderating effect of Family Support; the interaction term (Discr. at Work x Family Support) was not significant, but both stand-alone predictors remained significant; R2 = .18, Fchange in R2 = 25.96, p < .001 (see Table 14, model 9b). Thus Model 9a-b revealed that Family Support does not moderate, or change, the impact of Discrimination at Work on Mental Health Distress.    98 Table 14  Regression Analyses for Moderating Effect of Family Support on the Relationships Among Discrimination and K6 scores  K6 Scores  M9a 97b M10a M10b M10b Low M10b High Predictor b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) Wk Disc. .25 (.26)*** .25 (.26)***     HS Disc.   .29 (.30)*** .29 (.30)*** .40 (.40)*** .19 (.20)** Fam.

Model 10a-b (see Table 14) examined the effect of Family Support on the relationship among the predictor variable, Discrimination in High School, and the outcome variable, Mental Health Distress. The baseline model in this series, Model 10a, examined both Discrimination in High School and Family Support as predictors of Mental Health Distress. In this model, both variables were found to be significant predictors of Mental Health; R2 = .23, Fchange in R2 = 44.42, p < .001 (see Table 14, model 10a). The interaction model, Model 10b, revealed a significant moderating effect of Family Support; the interaction term (Discr. in High School x Family  99 Support) was significant; R2 = .24, Fchange in R2 = 31.2, p < .001 (see Table 14, Model 10b). The significance of the observed moderating variable prompted two subsequent analyses, model 10b Low and Model 10b High (see Table 14). Two new interaction terms were created: (1) Discr. in High School x Low Family Support, and (2) Discr. in High School x High Family Support, and added to the baseline model, separately. The outcomes of these two models reveal the moderating effect of Family Support; the trends therein show that as Family Support increases, the relationship between Discrimination in High School and Mental Health Distress decreases. For example, the standardized beta for Discrimination in High School in Models 10a and 10b (see Table 14) is (ß = .30, p < .001), whereas these coefficients increase with lower levels of Family Support (ß = .40; p < .001) and decrease with higher levels of Family Support (ß = .20; p < .001).  The third model in the series of moderation analyses, Model 11a-b (see Table 15), examined the effect of Community-level Support on the relationship among the predictor variable, Discrimination at Work, and the outcome variable, Mental Health Distress. The baseline model in this series, Model 11a, examined both Discrimination at Work and Community-level Support as predictors of Mental Health Distress. In this model, both variables were found to be significant predictors of Mental Health; R2 = .10, Fchange in R2 = 19.55, p < .001 (see Table 15, Model 11a). Of note, the R2 value and F value associated with Model 11a are relatively low, suggesting poor fit and predictive ability. Furthermore, the interaction model, model 11b, revealed no moderating effect of Community-level Support; the interaction term (Discr. at Work x Community-level Support) was not significant, but both stand-alone predictors remained significant; R2 = .10, Fchange in R2 = 13.21, p < .001 (see Table 15, Model 11b).  100 Table 15  Regression Analyses for Moderating Effect of Community Support on the Relationships Among Discrimination and K6 scores  K6 score  Model 11a Model 11b Model 12a Model 12b  Predictor b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) b (ß) Work Discrim. .29 (.29)*** .29 (.29)***   HS Discrim.   .34 (.34)*** .34 (.34)*** Comm.

The final model in the series of moderation analyses, Model 12a-b (see Table 15), examined the effect of Community-level Support on the relationship among the predictor variable, Discrimination in High School, and the outcome variable, Mental Health Distress. The baseline model in this series, Model 12a, examined both Discrimination in High School and Community-level Support as predictors of Mental Health Distress. In this model, both variables were found to be significant predictors of Mental Health; R2 = .15, Fchange in R2 = 26.65, p < .001 (see Table 15, Model 12a). The interaction model, Model 12b, revealed no moderating effect of Community-level Support; the interaction term (Discr. in High School x Community-level Support) was not significant, but both stand-alone predictors remained significant; R2 = .16, Fchange in R2 = 18.14, p < .001 (see Table 15, Model 12b). Thus, Model 12 revealed that an  101 increase of one standard deviation in Community-level Support (ß = -.12; p < 01) resulted in a decrease in Mental Health Distress among participants in this sample by .12 standard deviation. In other words, higher levels of Community-level Support are associated with decreased Mental Health Distress. Summary of Findings  The hypothesis for RQ3 was partially supported. Analyses revealed the moderating effect of Family Support on the relationship among Discrimination in High School and Mental health distress. There is a positive effect of Discrimination in High School on Mental Health Distress, however the effect is larger for individuals with low Family Support as compared to those with higher Family Support. However, Family Support did not moderate the impact of Discrimination in the Workplace on Mental Health Distress. Furthermore, the hypothesis asserting that Community-level Support moderates Mental health Distress was not supported in any models in the current analysis. The effect of Discrimination on Fear holds constant across different levels of Community Support. Implications of these findings will be more fully addressed in the Discussion section.   A resulting path diagram was derived using standardized coefficients produced from all of the analyses across the three research questions under examination in the current study; this model is displayed in Figure 5 below. In this diagram, each arrowed line represents the direction of influence from one construct to another. The coefficient value next to each line indicates the standardized estimate of influence in the direction of the arrow. The significance of each relationship is indicated with corresponding asterisks accompanying each standardized value.   102  Figure 5. Conceptual model with standardized coefficients for significant relationships.  103 CHAPTER V DISCUSSION  Discrimination and discriminatory events are pervasive and commonplace for LGBTQ+ identified individuals, often occurring daily and across multiple contexts of life (Fetner, 2008; Kosciw et al., 2018; Ryan, 2010; Waldo, 1999). Prevalent and ongoing discrimination often results in poor physical and mental health outcomes, creating a deep disparity between majority individuals and those from LGBTQ+ communities (Feinstein et al., 2012; Kosciw et al., 2018; Lehavot & Simoni, 2011; Mays & Cochran, 2001; Meyer, 1995, 2003). The minority stress model (Meyer, 1995, 2003) provides a clear framework for understanding the implicit and explicit processes at work within relationships between discrimination and mental health. Internalized homophobia, a consequence of endured harassment based on LGBTQ+ identity, is one facet that explains how discrimination negatively impacts mental health (Ross, 1985). Specifically, internalization of discrimination and harassment can lead to negative feelings toward one’s own identity and self as well as persistent anticipation and anxiety over potential future harassment from others (Meyer, 1993). An important distinction, the minority stress model also illuminates one salient protective factor for LGBTQ+ individuals, social support, which can ameliorate the negative effects of discrimination and internalized homophobia (Pachankis et al., 2008; Pachankis et al., 2014). Thus, current research surrounding LGBTQ+ issues seeks to further investigate the properties, nuance, and interplay among harassment,  104 internalized homophobia, social support networks, and mental health outcomes (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Meyer, 2015; Pachankis, 2007).   This particular study further investigated two components of the minority stress model: (1) anticipation of discrimination, and (2) social support as a protective factor. Specifically, the current study utilized fear of discrimination as an expression of anticipated rejection among LGBTQ+ individuals. Fear has not been previously demonstrated as a function of anticipated rejection in the minority stress model. Furthermore, fear of discrimination or anticipated rejection has not been investigated among LGBTQ+ individuals living in the Deep South, a region notoriously known for its traditional conservative social landscape (Barton, 2012; Fetner, 2008; Howard, 1997). This research study sought to understand how various types of social support may ameliorate or lessen the effects of actual endured harassment and fear of discrimination among LGBTQ+ individuals.  Fear of Discrimination as a Mediator Findings from the current study fit well within the body of research investigating both anticipation of discrimination (Feinstein et al., 2014; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Pachankis et al., 2008) and fear of crime and victimization (Fox & Asquith, 2018; Funk et al., 2007; Ross & Mirowsky, 2004). Anticipation of rejection among minority identified individuals often functions as a form of rejection sensitivity, manifesting as a kind of chronic hypervigilance or anxiety state (Feinstein et al., 2008), that is linked to poorer mental health outcomes as well as increased isolation and decreased help-seeking behaviors (Pachankis et al., 2007; Pachankis et al., 2008). Furthermore, anticipation of future rejection is a demonstrated moderator of the positive relationship between discrimination and mental health outcomes, whereby higher levels of anticipation of rejection is linked to higher mental health distress (Feinstein et al., 2012;  105 Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Pachankis et al., 2008). Findings from the current study, conversely, reveal the role of fear of discrimination as a mediator of that established negative relationship; this distinction and divergence from anticipated discrimination as a moderator is important in its implications. While previous research discusses anticipation of rejection as a state of anxiety or feelings of social discomfort (Meyer, 2003; Pachankis et al., 2008; Pachankis & Goldford, 2006), the current research broadens this focus to include a more intense emotional state of fear. Although anticipation of rejection is a mechanism by which the relationship between discrimination and mental health distress is intensified, the current study describes this concept as a function through which discrimination impacts mental health outcomes. In other words, anticipation of rejection, specifically, fear of discrimination, is a primary contributing factor to the process between objective discriminatory events negative mental health outcomes among LGBTQ+ individuals; thus, fear of discrimination is one way in which discrimination negatively impacts mental health. The current findings suggest, then, that fear of discrimination is both an outcome of endured harassment, as well as an emotional state that influences general mental health well-being.  Individuals who have higher levels of fear of crime and victimization also have increased physical and mental health issues as a result of the chronic hypervigilance associated with fear of being victimized (Farrall & Gadd, 2004). Furthermore, individuals who belong to vulnerable populations, such as minority cultures and ethnicities, women, and those belonging to older age cohorts, exhibit higher fear of crime (Fisher & Sloan, 2003; Glass et al., 1999; White et al., 1987). Similarly, individuals living in more urban, densely populated areas show increased fear of crime than those living in more rural and suburban areas (Belyea & Zingraff, 1988; Ross et  106 al., 2001; Ross & Mirowsky, 1999). Finally, fear of crime has been examined specifically among LGBTQ+ individuals; fear of victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals is accumulative across the life span and linked to contexts in the civil domain (i.e., including family, home, and non-governmental organizations and institutions; Fox & Asquith, 2018; Meyer & Grollman, 2014).  Describing Fear in the Deep South The current study suggests that fear of victimization and discrimination among LGBTQ+ individuals living in the Deep South may be more pervasive and expansive than fear of victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals in previous research studies (Fox & Asquith, 2018). Fear of discrimination and victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals in the Deep South, for example, clearly extends to public domains such as businesses and government, in addition to the civil domains of family and private spheres. For example, 80% of participants in the current study reported fear of discrimination or harassment in a public settings, and 64% reported fear of being denied service by private businesses. Additionally, preliminary analyses in the current study suggest that the theories based on fear of crime may not hold true for LGBTQ+ populations.  Although social scientists note that fear of crime is typically higher among individuals living in urban, inner cities (Ross et al., 2001) and vulnerable populations such as older individuals and women (Fisher & Sloan, 2003), data from this sample of participants do not support these findings. Individuals living in more rural areas of the Deep South in this sample of participants reported higher levels of fear than those living in less rural, more populous areas. LGBTQ+ individuals living in rural areas of the Deep South have less access to other LGBTQ+ individuals, organizations, and networks (Pellegrine et al., 2019b), which are known to buffer against the deleterious effects of discrimination and anticipation of rejection (Meyer, 2015).  107 Additionally, younger participants reported higher levels of fear than older participants in this sample. This observation may be due to LGBTQ+ individuals coming out at younger ages today than did their older LGBTQ+ counterparts years ago (Kosciw et al., 2018; Pellegrine et al., 2019b); thus, perhaps younger individuals have been exposed to direct backlash and discrimination at younger ages than their older counterparts, on average. With regard to race/ethnicity, Black participants reported less fear than White participants in this sample; however, other non-White respondents reported higher levels of fear than both Black and White respondents. This trend is particularly interesting given that previous findings indicate increased negative experiences with law enforcement and the legal system among Black and non-White respondents (Pellegrine et al, 2019b). Furthermore, Black and other non-White respondents in this sample reported higher dissatisfaction with opportunities for worship and availability of affirming church communities as well as fewer opportunities for networking with LGBTQ+ others than their White counterparts, which may limit social support (Pellegrine et al., 2019b). Thus, further investigation surrounding this finding is warranted in order to understand the protective and resilience factors among Black LGBTQ+ identified individuals.  Findings from the current study also reveal that men, nonbinary, and trans individuals reported higher levels of fear than women in the current sample. However, according to fear of crime theories, women tend to have higher levels of fear than men because of their increased relative vulnerability (Wilcox et al., 2006). I argue that LGBTQ+ identified men and individuals with non-normative gender identities are more vulnerable than LGBTQ+ identified women because of their deviance from traditional masculine and gendered norms, especially in the Deep South. LGBTQ+ men may pose a threat to the ideals of hegemonic masculinity (i.e., ideologies that legitimize traditional concepts of being a man), and thus, destabilize paradigms of patriarchy  108 that situate men and masculinities as most powerful in society. Furthermore, nonbinary and transgender individuals threaten the validity of the gender binary, the very foundation upon which hegemonic masculinity and patriarchal values lie. Individuals holding LGBTQ+ identities appear to have a unique set of vulnerabilities aside from those affecting the general population.  Overall, the current research study and findings thereof demonstrate the impact of fear of discrimination as a type of anticipation of rejection in the minority stress model. Pervasive, chronic fear among LGBTQ+ individuals is one mechanism through which discrimination negatively affects mental health outcomes. This effect of fear is important to consider when working with individuals within LGBTQ+ communities, whether designing new community and advocacy programs or mental health treatments and interventions. Furthermore, clinicians, public officials, and scholars must also consider what other aspects of social life are influenced by this persistent fear. Fear of victimization can promote increased isolation and withdrawal (Ravenscroft et al., 2002; Whitley & Prince, 2005), yet the minority stress model clearly delineates the importance of community networks and social support in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals (Meyer, 2003, 2015; Meyer et al., 2008). Higher levels of fear may dissuade LGBTQ+ individuals from engaging with their communities and reaping the benefits thereof. Social Support as a Moderator  Findings from the current research related to community-level and family support add to the ongoing scholarly conversation surrounding the positive impact of social support among LGBTQ+ individuals and communities (Fiori & Jager, 2012; Frost et al., 2016; Meyer, 2016). Social support as a protective factor is well established (Frost et al., 2016; Konishi et al., 2013; Meyer, 2016; Porta et al., 2017; Ryan, 2010), indicating that support from other individuals and organizations serves as a moderator of the positive relationship between discrimination and  109 mental health distress, whereby increased social support weakens the impact of discrimination on mental health distress (Kashubeck-West et al., 2008; Meyer, 2003; Szymanski & Carr, 2008). Thus, various forms of social support, including interpersonal relationships, inclusive organizations, and supportive organizational and governmental policies, act as strong protective factors for LGBTQ+ individuals against poor mental health outcomes (Hatchel et al., 2019; Rothman et al., 2012; Ryan et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2010). Two types of social support, family and community, were investigated for their moderating potential in the current research study.   Family support is, by and far, one of the most influential and instrumental types of social support in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals (D’Augelli et al., 2005; Rothman et al., 2012). For example, LGBTQ+ individuals who do not have support of their families and are rejected because of their LGBTQ+ identities are over eight times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual counterparts (Ryan et al., 2009). Likewise, rejection from family members leads to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues among LGBTQ+ individuals (Rothman et al., 2012; Ryan et al., 2010). Conversely, LGBTQ+ individuals who have intact family support systems show increased self-esteem, lower rates of physical and mental health issues, and overall positive adjustment as compared to LGBTQ+ individuals who do not have family support (Snapp et al., 2015). Community support and networking are included as components of the minority stress model, which illustrates the essential need to connect with other LGBTQ+ individuals and allies for healthy identity development and other positive benefits therein (Meyer, 2003). Community-level supports may also include valuable resources such as word-of-mouth referrals and linkages which can help LGBTQ+ individuals cope with stress such as established networks among physical and mental healthcare providers, physical spaces where LGBTQ+ individuals can  110 congregate and feel safe, as well as protective policies at the state and local levels (Frost et al., 2016; Nesmith et al., 1999). Although social support is an important positive factor for LGBTQ+ individuals, this construct has not been previously examined with regard to its relationship with anticipation of rejection, specifically fear of discrimination. Findings from the current study provide additional context regarding the mechanisms and nuance within these relationships among LGBTQ+ individuals.   The current study investigated how the relationships among: (1) discrimination and mental health outcomes; and (2) discrimination and fear are changed, influenced, or alleviated due to presence of social support, specifically, community-level and family supports. Overall, the analyses conclude that family support moderates the relationships among both discrimination and mental health distress as well as discrimination and fear such that increased family support lessens the impact of discrimination on both outcomes of mental health distress and fear. Examining these findings closer reveals some nuanced differences among the established relationships. Family support mediates the relationships between discrimination in both contexts (workplace and high school) and the outcome, fear; however, family support only mediates the relationship among discrimination in high school and mental health distress. Family support does not impact the relationship between discrimination in the workplace and mental health distress in the current study. However, community-level support is not a moderator among these relationships in the current study. Community-level support is likely not implicated as a moderator in the current research study because of the nature of responses garnered from the sample. The range of scores for the measure of community-level support includes less variance revealing a restricted range of responses on the lower end of the measure. Thus, because no respondents reported the highest possible rating for community-level support, the ability to  111 detect the true impact of this construct statistically may be diminished. Future research should investigate the impact of community-level support using data including the full range of response options for the measure. This may be best accomplished in a more metropolitan area where there are more opportunities for networking and social gathering than are available to LGBTQ+ individuals in the Deep South.  Social Support and Fear Although family support does not moderate the established relationships between workplace discrimination and mental health distress, family support does alleviate the impact of discrimination in the workplace on fear. Overall, mental healthcare providers may glean more insightful and impactful implications from the current findings by primarily considering the impact of family support on alleviating fear of discrimination. Findings from the current analysis add to the body of literature implicating the important protective function of family support in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals. Specifically, the current study is the first to show the protective influence and alleviating impact of family support on anticipation of rejection, namely fear, among LGBTQ+ individuals.  While community-level support is not indicated as a moderator of the relationships among contextual discrimination and outcomes of fear or Mental health distress, the outcome of these analyses may still hold some important implications. For example, each of the analyses yields similar results of influence of community-level support; a negative relationship exists between community-level support and outcomes of fear and Mental health distress. In other words, participants with lower levels of community-level support yield higher scores on both fear of discrimination and mental health distress scales, indicating increased fear and negative mental health outcomes. Thus, lack of community-level supports such as: (1) networks with  112 other LGBTQ+ individuals and allies; (2) presence of LGBTQ+ organizations; (3) signs of LGBTQ+ visibility; and (4) supportive community businesses may put LGBTQ+ individuals at greater risk for poorer mental health outcomes. Considerations regarding community-level supports are particularly important in conservative and rural areas where fear of discrimination may be higher among LGBTQ+ individuals and family support may not be available.  Limitations  The current study is a secondary analysis of existing data, and is, therefore, limited by the quality of the survey instrument and measures included in the original study (see APPENDIX A). The survey instrument used in the original data collection was not previously tested for quality, validity, or reliability of measures; thus, the current study contains a pre-analysis including exploratory factor analyses of proposed measurement items and scales in an attempt to account for validity and reliability of the instrumentation.   The availability and quality of data included in the current study is further restricted by the availability of data and data collection efforts used in the original study. A limitation of the current study, then, includes parameters and constraints of participant pool and subsequent ability to generalize findings due to these limitations. For example, the use of an online survey instrument for the original data collection implies that only participants with computer and internet access participated in the study. Furthermore, participants were recruited via snowball sampling and participation in local LGBTQ+ events. The researcher cannot be certain to what extent adults who do not participate in local LGBTQ+ events and LGBTQ+ adults living in rural areas had an opportunity to access the original study due to lack of awareness. In other words, that data collection efforts may result in an oversampling of LGBTQ+ individuals living in more populous areas of the state due to increased access to LGBTQ+ organizations, events, and  113 networks in these areas. Thus, it is unknown whether participants in the original study are the same on all relevant criteria as LGBTQ+ adults in Mississippi who were not able to access computers or were unaware of the opportunity to participate. Furthermore, the sample of participants in the original study is disproportionately Caucasian, as evidenced by demographic data from original study participants. Only 17.2% of respondents in the original study were non-White, yet recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2019) indicates that 40.9% of adults living in Mississippi are non-White. Thus, the current study findings are lacking perspectives and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals of color and may be skewed by the overrepresentation of Caucasian respondents. Additionally, this sample of respondents is more educated than the general population of adult Mississippians; 52.4% of respondents reported holding a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to only 21.8% of adults in Mississippi (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). These issues inevitably impact the ability to generalize findings from the current study. Overall, the decision to use existing survey data necessarily results in subsequent limitations. The following sections include implications for counselors, counselor educators, and researchers based on current study findings.  Implications Implications for Counselors   The findings from the current research study fit well within the American Counseling Association (ACA) Advocacy Competencies (ACA, 2018) which highlight the importance of advocacy and social justice work for counseling professionals and for the benefit and well-being of their clients. At the level of direct service, counselors should focus on client empowerment by identifying systemic barriers and discussing behaviors and emotions reflecting responses to systemic and internalized oppression (ACA, 2018). Given the current findings indicative of the  114 prominence of fear in the daily lives of LGBTQ+ individuals, mental health therapists must attune their attention toward emotions and expressions of anxiety, worry, and fear when working with these populations. Counselors can assess for presence and levels of fear and chronic anxiety surrounding anticipation of discrimination at various points throughout therapeutic work. Clients and their counselors can explore places, events, and individuals who may trigger such emotions and associated thoughts. Management of the emotional states associated with fear of discrimination (i.e., anxiety, worry, hypervigilance) must be a focus of treatment planning with alleviation or reduced levels being goals therein. Chronic fear and anxiety due to poor social treatment may lead to increased isolation and diminished networking. Given the importance of social support as a protective factor against negative mental health outcomes, counselors can investigate to what extent their LGBTQ+ clients are engaged in their communities. Furthermore, counselors can provide brief psychoeducation surrounding the importance and benefits of creating and participating in LGBTQ+ communities. LGBTQ+ clients may be more likely to seek and utilize local LGBTQ+ networks and systems when these behaviors are reinforced by mental health professionals. Furthermore, counselors may serve as referral sources and access to some community-level organizations and resources. For this reason, counselors must be aware of and engaged with local LGBTQ+ entities.  Counselors may need to advocate on behalf of their clients in some cases where they may choose not to engage in advocacy due to fear of retribution, harassment, or backlash (ACA, 2018). This type of advocacy might involve addressing issues within the counselor’s own organization or agency such as a school or business or within more broad systems of care on behalf of a specific client. For example, to combat discrimination in schools, a school-based  115 mental health therapist or school counselor may advocate for creating a Gay Straight Alliance or adoption of more supportive and inclusive policies within the school. Counselors may also advocate on behalf of their clients by working with physical healthcare providers and legal officials regarding processes and respectful treatment within specific healthcare or government agencies and organizations. For example, licensed mental health therapists may advocate for their transgender clients by writing letters of support and documentation for medical transition procedures. Counselors may retain lists of supportive physicians, legal experts, and other service providers for referral purposes by identifying and partnering with allies within local LGBTQ+ organizations as well as the surrounding community. This kind of advocacy at the client level is important, particularly given findings from a recent survey of LGBTQ+ individuals which revealed that respondents felt they did not have proper referrals and linkages among service providers (Pellegrine et al., 2019b).  Community and Systemic Advocacy   Community and systemic advocacy incorporate work with local community entities to identify and address systemic barriers and issues; this level of advocacy may include, for example, group facilitation, consultation, training and education, and research (ACA, 2018). Counselors can partner with local healthcare, education, and legal agencies and organizations to provide targeted trainings surrounding considerations and best practices for LGBTQ+ patients and clientele. LGBTQ+ individuals often report unfair or disrespectful treatment by their physicians, government officials, educators, religious leaders, and individuals working for private businesses (Pellegrine et al., 2019b), thus contributing to increased feelings of fear and worry. Trainings can include information and data regarding the link between discrimination, fear, and physical and mental health disparity. Counselors can consult with local businesses on  116 exclusionary and harmful workplace policies as well as help develop and implement policies that promote positive work climates for all employees. Counselors may also engage in collective action, addressing issues that may exist on a broad scale.  Collective action involves advocacy strategies in the public sphere (i.e., spaces where individuals can gather to discuss and debate social problems and influence political action), including local activism and grassroots organizing in order to increase awareness, lobby for policy change, and other such actions (ACA, 2018). Actions that fall under this category are extensive and necessarily include collaboration and networking. Thus, counselors must work to become allies of LGBTQ+ communities, which may include engagement with LGBTQ+ organizations, movements, and stakeholders. To this end, counselors may consider their roles in the larger movement toward LGBTQ+ visibility and equality. Support for LGBTQ+ organizations and events promotes greater visibility of LGBTQ+ communities and issues, thereby normalizing and amplifying the voices of LGBTQ+ individuals and their experiences. Increased visibility of LGBTQ+ communities and efforts may also reach LGBTQ+ individuals who are not already engaged with their communities, potentially reducing isolation and associated negative mental health outcomes. Furthermore, counselors may also lobby for protective policies for LGBTQ+ individuals and their families at the state and local levels. Through partnerships and collaboration with local LGBTQ+ communities, counselors can work to establish trust with community stakeholders and individuals. LGBTQ+ individuals often seek mental health therapists by worth-of-mouth from their social networks (Bess & Stabb, 2009); thus, these kinds of partnerships will create natural outreach and recruitment linkages between LGBTQ+ communities and local, supportive service providers.    117 Implications for Counselor Educators  Counselor educators are required by the governing body of the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) to teach accurate and ethical multicultural counseling competencies to students in their counseling programs (CACREP, 2016). The 2016 CACREP standards clearly delineate the importance of teaching knowledge content and skills related to social and cultural diversity; Section 2 addresses the Professional Counseling Identity and includes Social and Cultural Diversity as one of eight core areas under which “foundational knowledge is required of all entry-level counselor education graduates” (CACREP, 2016; Core II.F.2). Included within this area of education are competencies and proficiency related to theories and models of multicultural counseling and strategies for identifying and eliminating barriers as well as processes oppression and discrimination (CACREP, 2016; Core II.F.2.b, c, h). Thus, counselor educators must incorporate models of counseling pertaining to effective treatment of LGBTQ+ clients and populations, including practices that integrate multicultural and culture-specific awareness, knowledge, and skills into counseling interactions (Arredondo et al., 1996).  Counselor educators can consider including the minority stress model in their curriculum and instruction related to social and cultural diversity. The base of the minority stress model is applicable not only to LGBTQ+ communities and populations, but also to other minoritized populations including racial and ethnic minorities, individuals who are differently abled, and those from marginalized cultures and nationalities (Meyer, 1995; 2003). The minority stress model is particularly strong in its explanation of the etiology of mental health distress related to minority identity status through the mechanisms of discrimination and subsequent internalized oppression and expectations of discrimination from majority individuals and the greater society  118 (Meyer, 1995, 2003). Specifically, counselor educators can focus on the link between discrimination and anxiety states related to expectations of rejection as these feelings may pose significant barriers in the lives of marginalized clients. Furthermore, anticipation of rejection is linked to decreased help-seeking behavior and self-advocacy among Black and African American individuals (Mendoza-Denton et al., 2002); thus, other similarly stigmatized individuals may be reluctant to seek help when feelings of anxiety and fear related to antipiated rejection are present. Counselor educators must discuss these issues with their students, making clear links between empirical research findings and application in clinical practice. Counselor educators can also focus on the increased mental health burden and fear among individuals who hold multiple marginalized identities, pointing out the importance and complexity of an intersectional client focus.  Marginalized communities develop sources of strength and resilience that must also be highlighted in multicultural curricula. Specifically related to LGBTQ+ individuals and communities, the protective factors stemming from social support and networks must be clearly explained, including the importance and prominence of chosen families, which do not always approximate the standard model of the nuclear family in this society. Additionally, counselors-in-training need to understand how to help their LGBTQ+ clients seek and find social support and community networks. With this, counselor educators can provide students with resources and information from the ACA Advocacy Competencies (2018) regarding how to advocate for and with their LGBTQ+ clients, including linkages with local community networks. Counselor educators can also encourage or require counselors-in-training to attend Safe Zone trainings (Safe Zone Project [SZP], 2018), or other similar ally trainings on their campuses, in local communities, or online. These trainings provide opportunities for participants to learn about  119 LGBTQ+ identities, gender and sexualities, and other issues facing LGBTQ+ individuals and communities (SZP, 2018). Implications for Researchers  Researchers can extend the findings and implications from the current study by illuminating how the mechanisms of the minority stress model affect and function among LGBTQ+ communities in other regions. Similar needs assessments can be carried out in other similar regions, but also in vastly different regions, such as the Northeast, West Coast, and Mid-Western regions of the United States. For example, LGBTQ+ individuals living in distinctive regions may not be impacted as strongly by discrimination in their lives such that observed levels of fear and anticipation of discrimination are lower among some LGBTQ+ communities. Additionally, the protective factors associated with community-level support may be more influential in areas with increased community presence, visibility, and opportunities for networking. Comparative studies investigating the differential effects of these processes and factors will provide a more accurate model to be utilized in clinical practice, public health initiatives, and in policy development for LGBTQ+ individuals and communities.  The demonstrated importance of community networking and social support (Fiori & Jager, 2012; Frost et al., 2016; Meyer, 2016) suggests that future research investigating level of outness among LGBTQ+ related to various components of the minority stress model is warranted. Future studies, for example, can examine how contextual discrimination impacts outness as well as how fear of discrimination may affect levels of outness among LGBTQ+ individuals. Furthermore, researchers can investigate how outness impacts LGBTQ+ individuals perceived level of community support and available networks therein. Future research can also address these questions from an intersectional perspective.   120  Resulting models derived from the current research study must be analyzed again, separately by age, race, and gender identity status in order to understand how intersecting identities and demographics may influence effects and functioning of components of the minority stress model. For example, fear of discrimination may have a stronger influence among LGBTQ+ people of color and transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. Furthermore, these individuals may use their social networks and community supports in different ways; thus, a more granular investigation is warranted to understand the complexity and different ways of being among subsets of LGBTQ+ communities. Future research must include larger samples of Black LGBTQ+ individuals in order to unearth protective factors therein. In order to garner the support and participation of Black and other non-White LGBTQ+ individuals for future investigation, it is highly recommended that researchers form teams including and centering Black LGBTQ+ researchers. Future research studies can also investigate the impact of protective and supportive policies across various contexts. For example, researchers can compare and contrast the mental health well-being of LGBTQ+ employers across different workplaces with varying levels of supportive administration and friendly climate. Similarly, researchers can compare and contrast the impacts of supportive and protective policies among schools, colleges, and universities. Conclusion  The current study establishes fear of discrimination as an expectation of rejection, a proximal stressor, within the minority stress model (Meyer, 1995, 2003) and adds to the body of literature investigating fear of crime and victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals (Fox & Asquith, 2018). Thus, consideration of the impact of expectations of rejection and discrimination, including emotions of fear, surrounding everyday life and encounters in the lives  121 of LGBTQ+ individuals is an important task for clinical work and focus. Furthermore, LGBTQ+ individuals living in rural and conservative areas, such as the Deep South, may be at higher risk for development of chronic, increased levels of fear and anticipation of discrimination. LGBTQ+ communities may face unique vulnerabilities, making this group particularly subject to fear of victimization and discrimination. Comparative studies including samples of LGBTQ+ individuals from other regions are needed. Among this sample of participants, fear of discrimination is a significant determinant of mental health distress among LGBTQ+ individuals. Thus, in order to diminish the effects of anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination on mental health outcomes, mental healthcare providers must focus on this state of chronic hypervigilance. The current study also adds to a growing body of literature emphasizing the importance of social support as a protective factor against mental health distress for LGBTQ+ individuals (Fiori & Jager, 2012; Frost et al., 2016; Meyer, 2016). Family support buffers against the deleterious effects of ongoing discrimination on mental health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals; however, some LGBTQ+ individuals do not have the support of their family members. Thus, considering the significance of available and visible community-level supports and networks in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals is important for formation of social support and formation of chosen families. All LGBTQ+ communities, even those LGBTQ+ individuals who do not have the support and acceptance of their families, may find solace and healing from various community-level supports such as other LGBTQ+ individuals, LGBTQ+ inclusive spaces, and supportive and protective policies. Adopting a public health perspective may motivate policy makers to take vested interests in implementing protective and supportive policies at state and community levels in efforts to decrease the mental health disease burden among LGBTQ+ individuals and communities. Supportive workplace policies in particular can  122 be instrumental in helping LGBTQ+ employers succeed in their careers without fear of judgment and harassment, thus impacting overall well-being.  123 REFERENCES Allport, G.

    "abstract": "The current study is a secondary analysis examining the role of fear of discrimination and its influence and relationship with heterosexist discrimination, social support, and mental health distress among LGBTQ+ adults in the Deep South. A sample of 500 LGBTQ+ identified adults living across Mississippi completed a comprehensive needs assessment survey tapping into nine life domains. The current study investigated fear of discrimination as a form of rejection sensitivity utilizing the minority stress framework (Meyer, 1995, 2003). Mediating and moderating influences within the minority stress model were examined using series of regression analysis. Fear of discrimination operated as a mechanism through which discrimination negatively impacts mental health; participants who experienced higher levels of discrimination had greater fear and increased rates of mental health distress in the current study. Family support diminished the impact of discrimination on mental health distress. In other words, LGBTQ+ individuals with higher levels of family support were somewhat protected against the deleterious effects of discrimination and mental health distress. Community-level support, including availability of local LGBTQ+ organizations, networks, and protective policies, did not influence the relationship between discrimination and mental health. However, decreased levels of community-level support among participants in this sample appeared to negatively impact mental health. The current study provides new understanding of the stressors surrounding LGBTQ+ individuals lives, particularly with regard to the chronic state of fear experienced by LGBTQ+ individuals. Members of LGBTQ+ communities in the Deep South may experience more intense and chronic fear in daily interactions. Implications for counselors, counselor educators, and researchers are discussed",
