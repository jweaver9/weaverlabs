We hypothesized that feminist identification, perceived discrimination againstLGBTQ+, and strategic intra-minority alliance between feminists and LGBTQ+ wouldpredict their willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action. Study1 (N = 141) showed that higher feminist identification and more endorsement ofthe strategic intra-minority alliance predicted more willingness to participate insolidarity-based collective action amongheterosexual feministwomen inTurkey. Study2 (N = 644) replicated and extended the findings of Study 1 with a larger sample byshowing that higher awareness of sexual orientation privilege predicts more willing-ness to participate in solidarity-based collective action. By following an intersectionaland multi-identity approach in Study 3 (N = 280), we showed that higher feministidentification predicted more willingness to participate in solidarity-based collectiveaction, whereas higher heterosexual identification predicted less willingness.KEYWORDScollective action, feminist identity, intersectionality, LGBTQ+ rights, perceived discrimination,politicized identity, privilege awareness, solidarity1 INTRODUCTIONSocial psychological research on intergroup relations has overwhelm-ingly focused on interactions between majority and minority groups(e.g., Saguy et al., 2008, 2009; Shnabel et al., 2013; Verkuyten & Mar-tinovic, 2006). Even though research on intra-minority relations is agrowing field, little is known about the antecedents of intra-minoritysolidarity (see Burson & Godfrey, 2020). Social psychologists definesolidarity as one’s desire to work with other individuals or groupsfor social change with a sense of common cause or social change“The liberation of LGBTQ+ will also liberate heterosexuals”: This slogan is commonly used byTurkishqueer activists inPridemarches andprotests for LGBTQ+ rights.Manycis-heteroalliesparticipate in LGBTQ+movements in Turkey for the liberation of LGBTQ+ and themselves.This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, providedthe original work is properly cited.© 2021 The Authors.

Moreover, cur-rent approaches classify motivations for solidarity as ingroup-focused,outgroup-focused, personal, andmoralitymotivations (seeRadke et al.,2020). Building on this prior research, we argue that endorsement ofthe strategic intra-minority alliance as an ingroup focusedmotivation—individuals’ beliefs about whether they should work together withanother disadvantaged group—should be related to their behavioralintentions to engage in actions on behalf of those disadvantagedgroups (i.e., solidarity-based collective action).Across three studies, we aim to examine the role of (a) perceiveddiscrimination against another disadvantaged group (i.e., LGBTQ+community) among a politicized disadvantaged group (i.e., femi-nists), (b) feminist identification, and (c) endorsement of the strategicEur J Soc Psychol. 2022;52:377–390. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ejsp 377378 UYSAL ET AL.intra-minority alliance in heterosexual feminist women’s participationin solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights. Moreover, weaim to test whether awareness of sexual orientation privilege (Stud-ies 2 and 3) is associated with willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action. Last, we also aim to examine the role of advan-taged (i.e., heterosexual), politicized (i.e., feminist), and disadvantaged(i.e., woman) identities of heterosexual feministwomen in participationin solidarity-based collective action in Study 3 by following an intersec-tional and multi-identity approach (see Greenwood, 2012). We exam-ine these relationships in Turkey, in a context where both women andLGBTQ+ community have been targeted for a long time by the cur-rent government. In recent years, thegovernment inTurkeyhasbannedboth pride marches and feminist marches. In addition, crimes againsttrans people have remained unpunished, femicides are on the extremerise, and the president of religious affairs has made the LGBTQ+ com-munity a scapegoat during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the otherhand, feminist and LGBTQ+ activists have shown increasing solidaritywith each other, especially after the Gezi Park Protests in 2013, andremained politicized even though the pressure against both groups hasbeen increasing (Uluğ & Acar, 2018).1.1 Politicized ingroup identity andsolidarity-based collective actionAn extensive body of research in social psychology has examined thefactors thatmotivate people to engage in collective action (see Thomaset al., 2009; van Zomeren, 2016; van Zomeren et al., 2008).Most socialpsychology models of collective action suggest that feelings of injus-tice, social identity, and group efficacy are key triggers for collectiveaction (Thomas et al., 2012; van Zomeren et al., 2008). Thewell-knownapproaches of the psychological dynamics of collective action consis-tently showed that ingroup identity is either the strongest predictorof collective action or plays an essential role in mobilizing people (e.g.,Drury & Reicher, 2009; Klandermans, 1997; Stürmer & Simon, 2004;van Zomeren et al., 2008).Furthermore, van Zomeren and colleagues (2008) showed thatpoliticized ingroup identity is an even stronger predictor of collectiveaction participation (e.g., being an LGBTQ+ activist vs. being LGBTQ+;see Simon & Klandermans, 2001). However, collective action researchbroadly examines the impact of disadvantaged groups’ politicizedidentity on participating in collective action for ingroup causes (see vanZomeren et al., 2008), not for outgroup causes. For example, it has beenshown that feminist identity as a politicized identity predicts feminists’or women’s participation in collective action for gender justice (Girerd& Bonnot, 2020; Radke et al., 2018; Subašić et al., 2018; van Breenet al., 2017; Yoder et al., 2011). However, feminist identity, which isan identity that is usually associated with activism and solidarity withothermarginalized groups (see, e.g., Painia, 2018), should be addressedas an important antecedent of solidarity-based collective action. Wetherefore expect that, among heterosexual feminist women, higherfeminist identification would predict more willingness to participate insolidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights.1.2 Perceived discrimination and intra-minoritysolidarityRecent theorizing of Craig, Richeson, and colleagues (Craig & Riche-son, 2012, 2014, 2016; Craig et al., 2020; Richeson & Craig, 2011)moves the arguments of the Common Ingroup Identity Model aboutperceived discrimination one step further (Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000;Gaertner et al., 1993). This recent approach examines how individ-uals’ perception of their own group’s discrimination may influencetheir attitudes towards other minority groups. For instance, Craig andRicheson (2012) showed that perceived discrimination against Lati-nos affects Latinos’ attitudes towards Blacks through activating acommon ingroup identity, such as a disadvantaged racial minoritygroup identity. Similarly, Acar and Uluğ (2016) showed that dis-crimination experiences of different minority groups (e.g., femi-nists, LGBTQ+, Kurds) create cooperation among these groups towork against a shared goal. Facing discrimination due to beinga minority group member may help people perceive commonali-ties among different types of discrimination and support the coali-tion of their group with other minority groups (Craig & Richeson,2016).Craig and Richeson (2016) address some optimal conditions toincrease perceived commonalities and coalitional attitudes throughperceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination against one’singroup can elicit coalitional attitudes towards other minority groupsif they share similar disadvantaged identities, such as disadvantagedracial identities. Otherwise, perceived discrimination against one’singroup may even evoke negative attitudes towards other stigma-tized outgroups (for an exception, see Cortland et al., 2017). Forinstance, perceived sexism may lead to more negative racial atti-tudes towards Blacks and Latinos among White women (Craig et al.,2012) because perceived discrimination across identity dimensions,such as between a racial minority identity and a sexual minorityidentity, may trigger social identity threat and spurs the derogationof other minority groups (Craig & Richeson, 2016). Hence, thereare contradictory findings in the relationship between perceiveddiscrimination against one’s own group and intra-minority solidar-ity. In this article, we argue that heterosexual feminist women’sperceived discrimination against LGBTQ+ predicts their willing-ness to participate in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+rights.1.3 Solidarity and strategic alliance betweendisadvantaged groupsAlthough ingroup-led activism has mostly mobilized social movementsto challenge the status quo, outgroupmembers sometimes support thisactivism as well. Social psychologists have focused on the term politi-cal solidarity to understand solidarity-based activism (e.g., behavior orintention). For example, Leach and colleagues (2008) define politicalsolidarity as a component of identification; Subašić et al. (2008) as aprocess; Neufeld et al. (2019) as a psychological state (i.e., attitudes);THE LIBERATION OF LGBTQ+ WILL ALSO LIBERATE HETEROSEXUALS 379andGlasfordandCalcagno (2012) as anoutcome (i.e., collective action).Nonetheless, solidarity can be defined as the degree to which a personis committed to stand with the outgroup andwork with them for socialchange (seeNeufeld et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2018; Starzyk et al., 2019;Subašić et al., 2008).Solidarity has important outcomes for intergroup relations, includ-ing intra-minority relations. Starzyk and colleagues (2019) showed thata sense of solidarity among Canadians predicted support for Indige-nous people’s rights in Canada. In a similar study conducted byNeufeldet al. (2019) with Canadians, it has been shown that political solidaritywith Syrian refugees correlated with support for redistribution ofresources and power as well as collective action behaviors such asdonations. Subašić and colleagues (2018) also illustrated that a senseofcommoncausebetweenmenandwomenelicits higher solidarity-basedcollective action intentions for gender equality amongmen. In doing so,this finding highlights the role of solidarity beliefs on solidarity-basedcollective action for outgroups in the same identity categories (i.e.,men and women in the gender category). In the current study, we aimto move these previous findings one step further and test whetherstrategic intra-minority alliances between groups might predictsolidarity-based collective in an inter-category (here heterosexuals andLGBTQ+).Moreover, Radkeet al. (2020) argue thatbehavioral outcomesof sol-idarity such as intergroup helping and collective action may be fueledby both ingroup- and outgroup-focused motivations. As both hetero-sexual feminist women and LGBTQ+ in Turkey have faced oppres-sion from the current conservative government, we hypothesize thatheterosexual feminist women who endorse strategic intra-minorityalliance—their ingroup should stand in solidaritywith LGBTQ+—wouldbe more inclined to challenge the status quo in a broader sensethrough participation in solidarity-based collective action. Specifi-cally, we hypothesize that higher endorsement of the strategic intra-minority alliance would predict more willingness to participate insolidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights amongheterosex-ual feminist women.1.4 Privilege awarenessWhile Case et al. (2012, p. 3) define privilege as “unearned benefitsafforded to powerful social groups within systems oppression”, McIn-tosh (1988, p. 1) describes it as social structures that are constructedwith “an invisible package of unearned assets.” Even though privilege isdefined as a relational, contextual, or structural term in general, it is fairto argue that individuals who are members of advantaged groups suchasmen,Whites, or heterosexuals are often perceived as privileged.Some prior research has focused on how awareness of racial privi-lege may shift advantaged group members’ attitudes towards greateracceptance of the disadvantaged. For example, heightened privilegeawareness among White Americans has been shown to predict morepositive attitudes towards African Americans (Stewart et al., 2012;see also Powell et al., 2005). Relatedly, among heterosexuals, greateracknowledgment of heterosexual privilege has been linked to morepositive attitudes towards same-sexmarriage andmarriage equality aswell as ally behavior in lesbian and gay rights activism (Case & Stewart,2010;Montgomery& Stewart, 2012). As evidenced by these examples,the research conducted thus far has looked at how greater awarenessof privilege among advantaged groups predicts attitudes towards thedisadvantaged. Although the role of privilege awareness on affirmativeaction is addressed in previous research (Case, 2007, 2012; Case et al.,2014), less is known about how privilege awareness plays a critical rolein taking actiononbehalf of disadvantagedgroupmembers.Oneexcep-tion is the study by Uluğ and Tropp (2021), which showed that aware-ness ofWhite privilege predictedWhite Americans’ willingness to par-ticipate in collective action for racial justice. Even though these stud-ies show the importance of awareness of ingroup privilege for collec-tive action, no single study has focused on how privilege awareness ofa politicized group (i.e., feminists) who have both disadvantaged (i.e.,woman identity) and advantaged identities (e.g., heterosexual identity)may be associated with their willingness to take action to promoteintergroup equality.Recognition of discrimination and privilege are linked, yet they aredifferent social-psychological concepts and have different behavioraloutcomes (see Iyer et al., 2003; Leach et al., 2002; Uluğ & Tropp, 2021).Privileges of the relatively more advantaged groups make perceiveddiscrimination of stigmatized groups invisible or insignificant (see Bet-tinsoli et al., 2021; Case, 2012; Case et al., 2014). Other researchhas examined how advantaged group members respond when racialinequalities are framed either in terms of outgroup disadvantage oringroup privilege (see, e.g., Iyer et al., 2003; Leach et al., 2002; Loweryet al., 2012). This body of work suggests that recognition of outgroupdiscrimination and recognition of ingroup privilege are related, yet dis-tinct, concepts (Iyer et al., 2003), which predict different emotional andmotivational responses to inequality (Lowery et al., 2007, 2012). Forinstance, focusing on how disadvantaged racial groups are discrimi-nated against may lead members of advantaged racial groups to feelsympathy for the disadvantaged, whereas focusing on Whites’ advan-tage may lead Whites to feel guilty (Iyer et al., 2003). As Reimer et al.(2017; Study 1b) showed that heterosexual participants’ perceptionsof discrimination against non-heterosexuals do not predict their collec-tive action participation to promote the interests of LGBTQ+ commu-nities, we aimed to examine to what extent we would replicate theirfindings among heterosexual women who have both advantaged anddisadvantaged identities. Moreover, we focused not only on the per-ceived discrimination against the outgroup (i.e., LGBTQ+) but also onawareness of ingroup privilege as predictors of solidarity-based collec-tive action.1.5 Overview of studiesIn three studies, we aim to examine how heterosexual feminist womentake action for LGBTQ+ rights in Turkey. In particular, we investigatethe role of a) feminist identification, b) perceived discriminationagainst LGBTQ+, and c) endorsement of strategic intra-minorityalliance in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights among380 UYSAL ET AL.heterosexual feminist women (i.e., a group who has advantaged,politicized, and disadvantaged identities).Across three studies, we hypothesize that stronger feminist iden-tification would be linked with more willingness to participate insolidarity-based collective action (Hypothesis 1). We also hypothe-size that higher perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+ would belinked with more willingness to participate in solidarity-based collec-tive action (Hypothesis 2). Last, we expect that more endorsement ofstrategic intra-minority alliancebetween feminists andLGBTQ+wouldalso be linked with more willingness to participate in solidarity-basedcollective action (Hypothesis 3).2 STUDY 12.1 Method2.1.1 Participants and procedureWeaimed to collect data fromparticipantswho self-identify aswomen,feminists, and heterosexuals (https://osf.io/jup87/).1 We distributedthe link to the survey on Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp and usedsnowball sampling. Data were collected in Turkey right before theInternational Women’s Day (March 8). All participants completedthe online questionnaire voluntarily. A total of 188 self-identifiedwomen participated in the study. However, one participant who didnot complete the key study variables, three participants who did notself-identify as feminists, and 43 participants who did not identify asheterosexuals were excluded from the data. The final sample was com-posed of 141 participants.2 Participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 52years (M=30.33, SD=8.12). Fifteen participants had completed a PhDdegree, 30 an MSc degree, 80 a university degree, and 16 had gradu-ated from high school.2.1.2 MeasuresWe used 5-point response scales (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = stronglyagree) with the exception of the demographic variables mentionedabove.Feminist identification. Feminist identification was measured withsix items adapted from centrality, solidarity, satisfaction, and ingrouphomogeneity subscales of Leach and colleagues (2008). These itemswere “Being a feminist is something that reflects who I am”, “Being a fem-inist is important to me”, “I have a lot in common with other feminists”, “I1 These studies were approved by the Clark Committee for the Rights of Human Participantsin Research and Training Programs (IRB) at Clark University and the Sciences & TechnologyCross-Schools Research Ethics Committee at the University of Sussex.

Perceived discrimina-tion against LGBTQ+ was assessed by adopting three items fromVerkuyten and Yildiz (2006). These items were “Discrimination againstLGBTQ+ has increased in recent times”, “In Turkey, intolerance towardsLGBTQ+ is increasing”, and “LGBTQ+ are under threat in Turkey” (α= .75).Endorsement of strategic intra-minority alliance. Participants’beliefs about whether feminists should stand in solidarity withLGBTQ+ were assessed by adopting four items from Glasford andCalcagno (2012). These items were “Feminists and LGBTQ+ should worktogether to improve their position of both groups”, “Feminists should supportthe LGBTQ+ movement as best they can”, “Feminists and LGBTQ+ shouldunite and fight together”, and “Feminists and LGBTQ+ can achieve theirgoals only if they work together” (α= .81).Willingness to engage in solidarity-based collective action. Weused four items to measure participants’ willingness to participate incollective action for LGBTQ+ rights by adopting items fromOdağ et al.(2016): I would be willing to “attend meetings, forums, or discussion groupsof an LGBTQ+organization”, “participate in a protest related to the LGBTQ+movement over the Internet, through social media networks”, “addmy nameto the signature page for a collective protest related to the LGBTQmovementby e-mail or other ways”, and “participate in LGBTQ marches or actions”(α= .78).2.2 Results and discussionPreliminary analyses examined relations between the variables. Cor-relations among the variables and descriptive statistics are presentedin Table 1. Inspection of the means showed that, on average, partici-pants were highly identified with their ingroup (M = 4.45), perceivedhigh discrimination against LGBTQ+ (M = 4.64), largely endorsed thestrategic intra-minority alliance (M = 4.30) and showed greater will-ingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+rights (M = 4.50). Moreover, bivariate correlations indicated that allstudy variables positively and significantly correlated with each other(see Table 1).A linear regression analysiswas carried out in SPSS version 24 (IBM,2017) to examine the degree to which (a) feminist identification, (b)perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+, and (c) endorsement of thestrategic intra-minority alliance would be linked with willingness toparticipate in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights. Assummarized in Table 2, feminist identification (β = .24, p = .004) wasa significant predictor of willingness to participate in solidarity-basedcollective action. Specifically, higher feminist identification predictedhigher willingness to engage in solidarity-based collective action, sup-porting our first hypothesis. However, perceiveddiscrimination againstLGBTQ+ (β = .12, p = .137) did not associate willingness to par-ticipate in solidarity-based collective action. Lastly, endorsement ofthe strategic intra-minority alliance (β = .25, p = .003) was a signifi-cant predictor of willingness to engage in solidarity-based collectiveaction. Higher endorsement of the strategic intra-minority alliancewasTHE LIBERATION OF LGBTQ+ WILL ALSO LIBERATE HETEROSEXUALS 381TABLE 1 Means, standard deviations, and correlations of all measures in Study 1Variables M (SD) 1 2 3 41.

Findingsdemonstrated that higher feminist identification predicted more will-ingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+rights. Previous research showed that politicized ingroup identity isa strong predictor for participating in collective action (Radke et al.,2018; Simon & Klandermans, 2001). However, our study shows thatpoliticized ingroup identity also predicts solidarity-based collectiveaction for outgroup causes and thus extends the previous studies byindicating the role of politicized ingroup identity in solidarity-basedcollective action for outgroup causes.Study 1 did not find support for our second hypothesis that per-ceived discrimination against LGBTQ+would be linked with more will-ingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action. One can askwhy Hypothesis 2 was not supported in Study 1. As mentioned earlier,perceived discrimination across identity dimensions, such as betweena racial minority identity and a sexual minority identity, may triggersocial identity threat and spurs thederogationof otherminority groups(Craig & Richeson, 2016; Craig et al., 2012). In addition, the lack ofinsignificant findingsmay also be related to our sample size and charac-teristics as we tested our hypotheses among a relatively small sample.Last, Study 1 also found support for the third hypothesis thatmore endorsement of the strategic intra-minority alliance would belinked with more willingness to participate in solidarity-based col-lective action. Given how a sense of common cause (Subašić et al.,2018) and social change commitment (Neufeld et al., 2019) predictedsolidarity-based collective action in previous studies, our findings com-plement these findings by illustrating the role of the strategic alliancein solidarity-based collective action in particular and intra-minority sol-idarity in general.3 STUDY 2Study2aimed to replicate the findingsof Study1 (Hypotheses1, 2 and3)and extend the previous findings by examining how awareness of sex-ual orientation privilege plays a role in heterosexual feminist women’swillingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action (Hypoth-esis 4). As the sample size was relatively small in Study 1, Study 2 alsoaimed to test these hypotheses with a larger sample.3.1 Method3.1.1 Participants and procedureAs in Study 1, we aimed to collect data from participants who self-identified as women, feminists, and heterosexuals during the PrideMonth. We collected data from Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsAppusing snowball sampling. To improve the recruitment strategy in Study1, we also contacted online feminist groups in Turkey, such as Womenare Strong Together (Kadınlar Birlikte Güçlü) and Women’s Assemblyof Education and Science Workers’ Union (Eğitim ve Bilim EmekçileriSendikası KadınMeclisi).All participants completed the online questionnaire voluntarily. Atotal of 958 self-identified women participated in the study. Two par-ticipants who did not complete the key study variables, three partici-pants who did not self-identify as feminists, and 289 participants whodid not self-identify as heterosexuals were excluded from the sample.382 UYSAL ET AL.TABLE 3 Means, standard deviations, and correlations of all measures in Study 2Variables M (SD) 1 2 3 4 51.

Par-ticipants’ ages ranged from 18 to 63 years (M = 28.61, SD = 7.76).Forty-six participants had completed a PhD degree, 140 an MScdegree, 332 a university degree, 145 high school, and one secondaryschool.3.1.2 MeasuresWe used the same measures as those used in Study 1 to assess fem-inist identification (Leach et al., 2008; α = .80), perceived discrimina-tion against LGBTQ+ (Verkuyten & Yildiz, 2006; α= .74), endorsementof the strategic intra-minority alliance (Glasford & Calcagno, 2012;α = .88), and willingness to participate in solidarity-based collectiveaction (Odağ et al., 2016; α = .88). We again used 5-point responsescales (1= strongly disagree; 5= strongly agree) with the exception of thedemographic variables.Awareness of sexual orientation privilege. We used four itemsdeveloped by Case (2007) to assess participants’ awareness of sexualorientation privilege. These items were “Heterosexuals have privilegesthat LGBTQ+ do not have in this country”, “Heterosexuals havemore oppor-tunities than LGBTQ+ in employment and education”, “LGBTQ+ are disad-vantaged in society andheterosexuals are at an advantage”, and “Heterosex-uals are at an advantage because they holdmost of the positions of power inthis society” (α= .88).3.2 Results and discussionPreliminary analyses examined relations between the variables. Cor-relations among the variables, means, and standard deviations are pre-sented inTable3.As inStudy1, inspectionof themeans showed that, onaverage, participants were highly identifiedwith their feminist identity(M = 4.40), perceived high discrimination against LGBTQ+ (M = 4.61),largely endorsed the strategic intra-minority alliance that feministsshould stand in solidarity with LGBTQ+ (M = 4.23), and showedhigh willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action forLGBTQ+ rights (M= 4.07). In addition, in Study 2, participants showedhighawarenessof sexual orientationprivilege (M=4.73). Bivariate cor-relations indicated that all study variables positively and significantlycorrelated with each other (see Table 3).As in Study 1, a linear regression analysis was carried out in SPSSversion 24 (IBM Corp., 2017) to examine the degree to which (a) fem-inist identification, (b) perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+, (c)awareness of sexual orientation privilege, and (d) endorsement of thestrategic intra-minority alliance correlate willingness to participate insolidarity-based collective action. The standardized and unstandard-ized coefficients of our analyses are presented in Table 4.As in Study 1, feminist identification (β = .21, p < .001) was a sig-nificant predictor of willingness to participate in solidarity-based col-lective action. Specifically, higher feminist identification is linked withhigher willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action.Unlike the findings of Study 1, higher perceived discrimination againstLGBTQ+ (β = .11, p = .001) is linked with more willingness to partic-ipate in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights. More-over, higher awareness of sexual orientation privilege (β= .11, p= .001)is linked with more willingness to participate in collective action forLGBTQ+ rights among heterosexual feminist women. Lastly, endorsingthe strategic intra-minority alliance associated willingness to partici-pate in solidarity-based collective action (β = .44, p < .001). In otherwords, more endorsement of the strategic intra-minority alliance islinked with higher willingness to participate in solidarity-based collec-tive action.As in Study 1, Study 2 found support for Hypothesis 1 that politi-cized ingroup identity would be linked with willingness to participatein collective action for the outgroup cause. Our findings indicatedthat higher feminist identification correlated more willingness to par-ticipate in solidarity-based collective action. Study 2 also found sup-port for Hypothesis 2 that perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+would be linked with willingness to participate in collective actionfor LGBTQ+ rights, contrary to Study 1. The findings of Study 2also supported Hypothesis 3 as in Study 1. Findings demonstratedthat more endorsement of the strategic intra-minority alliance corre-lated greater willingness to participate in solidarity-based collectiveaction.Our results also extended the findings of Study 1 regarding sex-ual orientation privilege awareness. The results showed that higherawareness of sexual orientation privilege is related to a greater will-ingness to engage in solidarity-based collective action, thus they sup-ported Hypothesis 4 and extended previous findings by shedding lighton the role of privilege awareness in solidarity-based collective action(e.g., Case et al., 2014; Stewart et al., 2012).THE LIBERATION OF LGBTQ+ WILL ALSO LIBERATE HETEROSEXUALS 383TABLE 4 Model summary of regression analysis in Study 2Willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rightsB SE β t pFeminist identification .41 .06 .21 6.70 < .001Perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+ .19 .06 .11 3.33 .001Awareness of sexual orientation privilege .19 .04 .11 3.20 .001Strategic intra-minority alliance .54 .06 .44 12.47 < .001F 125.807R2 .4334 STUDY 3Collective action research overwhelmingly addresses a single iden-tity and investigates the impact of this particular identity on collec-tive action. Greenwood (2012) criticized these singular approaches andpointed out the intersectional and multiple real-world identities (seealso Anderson & Koc, 2020; Koc & Vignoles, 2016, 2018). In recentyears, researchers have paid increasing attention to how and why peo-ple who have both advantaged and disadvantaged identities, such asbeing aWhite woman, engage in collective action for racial justice andbecome allies to outgroup members (Ostrove & Brown, 2018; Tropp& Uluğ, 2019). However, little is known about how and why politi-cized disadvantaged groupmembers decide to participate in solidarity-based collective action for other disadvantaged groups.Although allyship studies in social psychology (e.g., Tropp & Uluğ,2019; Uluğ & Uysal, 2021) partly challenged the singular approachesby examining how andwhy groupmembers who have both advantagedand disadvantaged or ally identities engage in collective action fordisadvantaged group members (e.g., White women’s collective actionparticipation in a Women’s March), and how and why disadvantagedingroup identity impacts participation in collective action for anotherdisadvantaged group remained unanswered (e.g., women’s collectiveaction participation for LGBTQ+ rights). We believe that we need toconsidermultiple identities and the positions of these identities in soci-ety to unpack the dynamics behind intra-group solidarity. For exam-ple, a feminist woman may be in a disadvantaged position becauseof her gender and political identity in society. However, her sexualorientation identity may create an advantaged position for her com-pared to her LGBTQ+ counterparts. In Study 3, therefore, we aimto examine the role of advantaged (i.e., heterosexual), politicized (i.e.,feminist), and disadvantaged (i.e., woman) identities of heterosexualfeminist women in solidarity-based collective action for another disad-vantaged group (i.e., LGBTQ+). Thus, we aim to takemultiple identitiesof our participants into account (i.e., advantaged, disadvantaged, andpoliticized identities) in Study3.As in Studies1and2, our first hypothe-sis is that feminist identification would be linked with more willingnessto participate in solidarity-based collective action. As van Breen et al.(2017) have shown that it is not woman identity, but feminist identity,that is more related to attitudes towards collective action, we hypoth-esize that woman identification would not be linked with more willing-ness to participate in solidarity-based collective action (Hypothesis 5).However, as identificationwith the advantaged identity is usually asso-ciatedwithmore negative attitudes towards the disadvantaged aswellas motivation to protect the interests of the advantaged (Lowery et al.,2007; Stewart et al., 2012), we hypothesized that higher identificationwith heterosexual identity would be linked with lower willingness toparticipate in collective action for LGBTQ+ rights (Hypothesis 6).Although we tested and discussed the relationship between per-ceived discrimination against outgroup (i.e., LGBTQ+) and heterosex-ual feminist women’s willingness to participate in solidarity-based col-lective action, recent studies have also shown the role of perceiveddiscrimination against ingroup in intra-minority solidarity (e.g., Acar &Uluğ, 2016; Craig & Richeson, 2012). In Study 3, we also aim to exam-ine the role of perceived discrimination against both ingroup and out-group in willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action.Therefore, we hypothesize that perceived discrimination against out-group (i.e., LGBTQ+;Hypothesis 2) and ingroup (i.e., women;Hypothesis7) would be linked with higher willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action.Last, we believe that not only a person’s awareness of privilege thatcreates their disadvantaged position (e.g., gender privilege) but alsoawareness of privilege that creates their advantaged position (e.g., sex-ual orientation privilege) is important in predicting their willingness toparticipate in solidarity-based collective action. Therefore, we aim toexamine the role of awareness of gender privilege in solidarity-basedcollective action, in addition to the role of awareness of sexual orien-tation privilege. We hypothesize that higher awareness of both sex-ual orientation privilege (Hypothesis 4) and gender privilege (Hypothesis8) would be linked with higher willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action.4.1 Method4.1.1 Participants and procedureAs in Studies 1 and 2, we aimed to collect data from participants inTurkeywho self-identified aswomen, feminists, and heterosexuals.Wecollected data from Twitter using snowball sampling.

Partici-pants’ ages ranged from 18 to 60 years (M = 29.78, SD = 8.71). Thirty-two participants had completed a PhD degree, 66 an MSc degree, 109a university degree, 72 high school, and one secondary school.4.1.2 MeasuresWe used the same measures in Study 2 to assess feminist identifi-cation (Leach et al., 2008; α = .85), perceived discrimination againstLGBTQ+ (Verkuyten & Yildiz, 2006; α = .76), awareness of hetero-sexual privilege (Case, 2007; α = .79), endorsement of strategic intra-minority alliance (Glasford & Calcagno, 2012; α = .86) and willingnessto participate in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights(Odağ et al., 2016; α = .88). We also adapted these items to measureidentification with disadvantaged gender identity (i.e., woman identi-fication) by six items (Leach et al., 2008; α = .79; centrality, solidarity,satisfaction, and ingroup homogeneity), identificationwith advantagedsexual orientation identity (i.e., heterosexual identification) by fouritems (Leach et al., 2008; α= .83; centrality and ingroup homogeneity),perceived discrimination against women by three items (Verkuyten &Yildiz, 2006; α = .74), and awareness of gender privilege by four items(Case, 2007; α= .82).We used 5-point response scales (1= strongly dis-agree; 5 = strongly agree) with the exception of the demographic vari-ables, as we did in Studies 1 and 2.4.2 Results and discussionPreliminary analyses examined relations between the variables. Cor-relations among the variables, means, and standard deviations arepresented in Table 5. As in Studies 1 and 2, inspection of the meansshowed that, on average, participants were highly identified with femi-nist identity (M= 4.36), perceived high discrimination against LGBTQ+(M = 4.76), largely endorsed the strategic intra-minority alliance thatfeminists should stand in solidarity with LGBTQ+ (M = 4.37), andshowed high willingness to participate in solidarity-based collectiveaction for LGBTQ+ rights (M = 4.24). In addition, as in Study 2,participants displayed high awareness of sexual orientation privilege(M=4.79).Moreover, in Study3,we found that theywere highly identi-fiedwith their disadvantagedwoman identity (M= 4.21), whereas theyshowed low identification with their advantaged heterosexual iden-tity (M = 2.75). Participants also showed high perceived discrimina-tion against women (M= 4.77) and high awareness of gender privilege(M= 4.86).As in Studies 1 and 2, a linear regression analysis was carried out inSPSS version 24 (IBM Corp., 2017) to examine the degree to which (a)identification with multiple identities (i.e., politicized feminist identity,disadvantagedwoman identity, and advantaged heterosexual identity),(b) perceived discrimination against both ingroup (i.e., women) and out-group (i.e., LGBTQ+), (c) awareness of privilege as an advantaged group(sexual orientation privilege) and disadvantaged group (gender privi-lege), and (d) endorsement of the strategic intra-minority alliance cor-relate willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action.The standardized and unstandardized coefficients of our analyses arepresented in Table 6.As in the first two studies, identification with politicized femi-nist identity (β = .29, p < .001) related willingness to participatein solidarity-based collective action. Specifically, higher feministidentification is linked with higher willingness to participate insolidarity-based collective action. While identification with disadvan-taged woman identity did not associate willingness to participate insolidarity-based collective action (β= .04, p= .460) and supported ourfifth hypothesis, higher identification with advantaged heterosexualidentity is linked with lower willingness to participate in collectiveaction for LGBTQ+ rights (β=−.11, p= .039), supportingHypothesis 6.Both perceived discrimination against women (β = -.01, p = .970) andLGBTQ+ (β= .04, p= .628) did not associate willingness to participatein solidarity-based collective action. Thus, we did not find supportfor our second and seventh hypotheses. Moreover, higher awarenessof sexual orientation privilege (β = .17, p = .003) is linked with morewillingness to participate in collective action for LGBTQ+ rightsamong heterosexual feminist women, supporting Hypothesis 4, whereasTHE LIBERATION OF LGBTQ+ WILL ALSO LIBERATE HETEROSEXUALS 385TABLE 6 Model summary of regression analysis in Study 3Willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rightsB SE β t pFeminist identification .43 .08 .29 5.11 < .001Woman identification .06 .08 .04 .74 .460Heterosexual identification −.10 .05 −.11 −2.08 .039Perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+ .07 .14 .04 .47 .628Perceived discrimination against women −.01 .14 −.00 −.05 .970Awareness of sexual orientation privilege .35 .12 .18 3.03 .003Awareness of gender privilege .06 .17 .02 .33 .739Strategic intra-minority alliance .32 .07 .26 4.61 < .001F 17.866R2 .345awareness of gender privilege did not predict it (β= .02, p= .739). Thus,our findings did not support our last hypothesis. Similar to the findingsof Studies 1 and 2, endorsing the strategic intra-minority alliance islinked with willingness to participate in solidarity-based collectiveaction (β = .26, p < .001). In other words, more endorsement of thestrategic intra-minority alliance correlated with higher willingness toparticipate in solidarity-based collective action.35 GENERAL DISCUSSIONThe present research examined the role of feminist identification,perceived discrimination against another disadvantaged group (i.e.,LGBTQ+), and endorsement of the strategic intra-minority alliancebetween feminists and LGBTQ+ in heterosexual feministwomen’swill-ingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action. In doing so,we took the multiple identities of a politicized group with both advan-taged and disadvantaged identities (i.e., heterosexual feminist women)into account based on Greenwood’s (2012) singular approach critique.Although the dynamics between majority and minority groups havefrequently been studied in social psychology (Shnabel et al., 2013; Sub-ašić et al., 2018; Teixeira et al., 2020), the present set of studies shedssome light on the relationship between disadvantaged groups whoshare both similar and different (dis)advantaged identities. The currentset of studies also offers a different perspective in the field of collectiveaction, as the results show the underlyingmechanisms behind strategicalliances between disadvantaged groups that aim to bring about socialchange.All three studies offered support for our first hypothesis thatpoliticized ingroup identity—feminist identity—would be linked withwillingness to participate in collective action for outgroup causes. Gen-erally, feminist identity is associated with action and protests for gen-3 Wealso conducted a two-step hierarchical regression analysis by adding interactions of iden-tities in Step 2. However, neither the two-way interactions (feminist X heterosexual; feminist Xwoman; womanX heterosexual) nor the three-way interaction predictedwillingness to engagein collective action for LGBTQ+ rights among heterosexual feminist women.der equality (Girerd & Bonnot, 2020; Iyer & Ryan, 2009; Radke et al.,2018; van Breen et al., 2017; Yoder et al., 2011). However, to ourknowledge, current research is the first to show that feminist identifi-cation linkswithwillingness toparticipate in solidarity-based collectiveaction for another disadvantaged group.One of the underlying reasonsfor this finding may be that heterosexual feminist women in Turkeyacknowledge that LGBTQ+ are suffering from gender inequality andheteropatriarchy in the country (see, e.g., Baba, 2011; Engin, 2015).This acknowledgment can make them a potential ally in their strug-gle. Although heterosexual feminist women have an advantaged statuscompared to LGBTQ+ in terms of their sexual identity, both feministsand LGBTQ+ are exposed to gender inequality and patriarchal vio-lence in Turkey. This common threatmaymotivate feminists, especiallythose who tend to bemore politicized, to form a strategic alliance withLGBTQ+ for improving the ingroup’s causes and thereby predict het-erosexual feminist women’s support for LGBTQ+’s rights. We believethat high mean scores of endorsement of the strategic intra-minorityalliance and its association with willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action support this idea.We also found contradictory findings related to our second hypoth-esis: perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+ is linked with willing-ness to participate in solidarity-based collective action. While Study2 offered support for our second hypothesis, perceived discriminationagainst LGBTQ+ did not predict willingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action in Studies 1 and 3. The different and null effectsof perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+ in these studies comple-ment the previous findings in the literature that have shown similarinconsistent effects of perceived discrimination against ingroup andoutgroup (see, e.g., Reimer et al., 2017). For example, Craig, Richeson,and colleagues (Craig & Richeson, 2012, 2016; Craig et al., 2012, 2020;Richeson & Craig, 2011) showed that while acknowledging discrimina-tion experiences faced by the outgroup may activate a common disad-vantaged ingroup identity, perceived discrimination in inter-categories(e.g., racial minority group and sexual minority group) may increasesocial identity threats and hinder intra-minority solidarity. Like Stud-ies 1 and 3, Reimer et al. (2017, Study 1b) showed that heterosexual386 UYSAL ET AL.participants’ perceptions of discrimination against non-heterosexualsdo not predict their collective action participation to promote theinterests of LGBTQ+ communities. Hence, it is fair to argue thatperceived discrimination against an outgroup may not be enough tomotivate ingroup members (see Uluğ & Tropp, 2021). Nevertheless,perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+ predicted heterosexualfeminist women’s willingness to participate in collective action forLGBTQ+ rights in Study 2. This may be related to the salience of themovements in the time period of data collection as participants wererecruited just before the LGBTQ+ PrideWeek in Study 2.Our third hypothesis was supported across three studies: Endorse-ment of the strategic intra-minority alliance between feminists andLGBTQ+ predicts willingness to participate in solidarity-based col-lective action. One may ask why members of a disadvantaged group(women) feel that they should stand in solidarity with members ofanother disadvantaged group (LGBTQ+) and how this quest predictstheir participation in solidarity-based collective action for outgroupcauses (LGBTQ+ rights). Subašić and colleagues (2008) have suggestedtwo important facets of political solidarity. First, individuals shouldcommit themselves to the minority outgroup’s cause. In other words,people should feel a responsibility to the outgroup’s cause, namely “asense of common cause”, even if this cause does not directly relateto ingroup causes (p. 331). Second, individuals should show politi-cal solidarity as a social change commitment (see also Neufeld et al.,2019). In other words, individuals engage in activism, not just to helpthe outgroup but also to challenge the status quo and authority fortheir ingroup causes. Similarly, Radke et al. (2020) pointed out differ-entmotivations (i.e., ingroup-focused, outgroup-focused, personal, andmorality motivations) for solidarity. Scholars argue that advantagedgroupmembers seek goodmoral and social image through confrontinginequalities, whereas disadvantaged group members need power andsocial change (Selvanathan et al., 2020; Shnabel et al., 2008, 2009).In this respect, we argue that majority–minority solidarity mayrequire a sense of common cause (Subašić et al., 2008) or moralitymotivations (Radke et al., 2020); however, intra-minority solidarity isgenerally fostered by social change commitment (Subašić et al., 2008)or ingroup-focused motivations (Radke et al., 2020) such as strategicintra-minority alliance. Previous research has shown that disadvan-taged groups who unite around a shared goal against a perceived com-mon threat are more motivated to stand in solidarity with one another(see, e.g., Acar&Uluğ, 2016). As the current conservative government’spolitics in reinforcing thehatred against LGBTQ+ (KAOSGL, 2015) andattacks onwomen’s rights (WeWill Stop the Femicides, 2020) put bothwomen and LGBTQ+ at a disadvantage, heterosexual feminist womenmay have formed a strategic intra-minority alliance with LGBTQ+ toachieve ingroup goals to the extent they endorse this alliance.We also examined the role of awareness of ingroup’s privilegeson heterosexual feminist women’s willingness to engage in solidarity-based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights in Studies 2 and 3. Asexpected, higher awareness of sexual orientation privilege predictedhigher willingness to engage in solidarity-based collective action, thusconfirming our fourth hypothesis. People who are aware of theiringroup’s privilege have more positive attitudes toward outgroupmembers (Case & Stewart, 2010;Montgomery & Stewart, 2012; Stew-art et al., 2012) and even higher motivation to participate in collectiveaction for them (Uluğ & Tropp, 2021). Our findings contribute to theliterature on the role of privilege awareness not only in the contextof majority–minority relations (Case & Stewart, 2010; Montgomery &Stewart, 2012; Stewart et al., 2012; Uluğ & Tropp, 2021) but also in thecontext of intra-minority relations. However, our results also showedthat awareness of gender privilege did not predict solidarity-based col-lective action. Although awareness of sexual orientation privilege maybe more related to advantaged heterosexual identity, awareness ofgender privilege may reflect concerns of disadvantaged woman iden-tity. We therefore believe that awareness of gender privilege may be apredictor for ingroup-focused collective action rather than solidarity-based collective action.Lastly, we tested the role of multiple identities of participants inStudy 3 by takingGreenwood’s (2012) criticism into account. Althoughwe tested the role of feminist identification of heterosexual feministwomen inStudies1and2, themultifacetednatureof heterosexual fem-inist identity should not be overlooked. Heterosexual feminist womenhave a disadvantaged position in terms of their politicized and gen-der identity in Turkey. However, they can still be considered privilegedas they have a socially accepted sexual orientation compared to theirLGBTQ+ counterparts. Study 3 showed that different identities of thesame social groupmight have contradictory outcomes for their willing-ness to participate in solidarity-based collective action. While higherpoliticized feminist identification was related to willingness to par-ticipate in solidarity-based collective action, identification with disad-vantaged woman identity did not predict willingness to participate insolidarity-based collective action. These findings complement the pre-vious findings in the literature showing that identification with womanidentity reflects women’s critical attitudes towards or lower endorse-ment of gender stereotypes, while identification with feminist identityreflects attitudes towards collective action (e.g., vanBreen et al., 2017).On the other hand, higher identificationwith advantaged heterosexualidentity predicted less willingness to participate in collective action forLGBTQ+ rights, which is consistent with previous findings that advan-taged group identity may be a barrier to taking action on behalf of dis-advantaged groups (Stewart et al., 2012).We believe that studies with an intersectional approach should alsofocus on identity integration and identity (in)compatibility. Previousstudies on identity integration have shown that identity integrationmay have positive effects onwell-being (see, e.g., Koc&Vignoles, 2016,2018). Some recent studies have also indicated that the intersection ofincompatible identities predicts feelings like guilt and shame (Ander-son & Koc, 2020), which are known to be associated with willing-ness to collective action (Calcagno, 2016; Shepherd et al., 2013; Solak,Tagar, Cohen-Chen, Saguy, & Halperin, 2017). More work that focuseson whether the intersection of compatible versus incompatible iden-tities predicts collective action for ingroup versus outgroup causes isneeded. Moreover, building on our findings, we can argue that morework is needed to understand the contents of identities for disadvan-taged groups as these contents may (not) motivate members of disad-vantaged groups to choose to act for the benefit of their own groupTHE LIBERATION OF LGBTQ+ WILL ALSO LIBERATE HETEROSEXUALS 387(see, e.g., Uluğ et al., forthcoming) as well as on behalf of other disad-vantaged groups.5.1 Limitations and future directionsOur studies are not without limitations. We collected data online byusing social media platforms. Therefore, we believe that we reachedout to a young and politicized sample in Turkey. In general, young fem-inists in Turkey use social media frequently both to claim their rightsand to protest. Although reaching out to this politicized sample gaveus a unique opportunity to test the relationship between heterosex-ual feminist women’s ingroup identification (i.e., feminist identifica-tion) andwillingness to participate in solidarity-based collective action,we should be careful not to generalize our findings to all feminists inTurkey. As feminist perspectives differ in supporting LGBTQ+ rights(Price, 2020), future studies should make a more concerted effortto get a more heterogeneous sample and focus on generational dif-ferences in feminism, such as second-wave and third-wave feminists.Moreover, we conducted all of our studies during politically salienttimes. We collected data before March 8 for Study 1, before LGBTQ+Pride Week for Study 2, and after the Boğaziçi University protests forStudy3.Although theBoğaziçiUniversity protests have started againstthe appointment of Melih Bulu as rector of the university by Presi-dentErdoğan, theseprotests turned into allyship protests for LGBTQ+.That is the main reason why four LGBTQ+ activists were arrested, andthe ministry of interior referred to the arrested students as “LGBTperverts” in his tweets. As these different times might have affectedour findings, we believe that these studies should be replicated dur-ing politically less salient times by including more diverse samples. Inaddition, we targeted specifically feminist women across three studies.This might have reduced the range of feminist identification and cre-ated a ceiling effect for feminist identification scores. Therefore, futureresearchwhichmay focuson (non-feminist)womenandhowtheir iden-tification with feminist identity may be related to solidarity-based col-lective action is needed.Feminism has many variants associated with a variety of political,social, methodological, and philosophical perspectives. Some schol-ars have distinguished different feminist approaches such as radical,socialist, and liberal feminism (see, e.g., Campbell & Wasco, 2000;Code, 2000). Relatedly, it is important to note that at the time ofdata collection, TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) debates(see, e.g., Hines, 2019; Rodemeyer, 2018; Williams, 2016) were veryintense among feminist and queer activists in Turkey on social media.High mean scores of endorsement of the strategic intra-minorityalliance in our studies might mean that many trans-exclusionary fem-inists in Turkey did not participate in our studies. One may also askhow our results would look if we had asked feminists’ willingness toengage in collective action only for trans rights instead of LGBTQ+rights. Future studies should focus particularly on trans-exclusionaryfeminists to understand the barriers to both supporting LGBTQ+rights and collective action participation on behalf of LGBTQ+ amongthem.Van Breen et al. (2017) tested the interaction between feministand woman identification following the multiple identities approach.They could not find a significant effect of the interaction betweenfeminist and woman identification on collective action for LGBTQ+rights. Although our third study followed a similar approach andfocused on the role of intersectionality and multiple identities in col-lective action, we did not test the role of interaction between differ-ent identities (e.g., feminist, women, and heterosexual) due to the rel-atively small sample size and power in Study 3. This limitation mayhave prevented us from fully reflecting the intersectional approachin our research. Future works that aim to follow an intersectionalapproach should test the role of interaction between different identi-ties, especially the conflicted ones (e.g., advantaged and disadvantagedidentities).Another limitation concerns the items we used to measure iden-tification. While we used four of the five subscales (centrality, soli-darity, satisfaction, and ingroup homogeneity) of Leach et al.’s (2008)identification scale for measuring feminist and woman identities, weused two subscales (centrality and ingroup homogeneity) of the samescale to measure heterosexual identity. Even though we used ingrouphomogeneity as one of the subdimensions of the identification scale,some studies have also shown that identification can still be high evenwhen a lack of homogeneity exists (Jans et al., 2012). For this reason,we believe that researchers should be more careful while using subdi-mensions of identification that are discussed as distinct variables fromidentification such as ingroup homogeneity (e.g., Rubin & Badea, 2007,2012).Last, we believe that differences in effect sizes should be discussed.Across three studies, endorsement of the strategic intra-minorityalliance has high effect sizes (which is the highest in Studies 1 and2, and second highest in Study 3; over .25 standardized betas forall studies) in predicting solidarity-based collective action. In additionto this result, Radke et al. (2020) positioned motivations of solidar-ity (e.g., ingroup-focused motivations) such as strategic intra-minorityalliancebetween theantecedentsof solidarity (e.g., identification, emo-tions, attitudes) and behavioral outcomes of solidarity (e.g., collec-tive action). Given this result, it is fair to argue that strategic intra-minority alliance may be a more proximal predictor of solidarity-basedcollective action than the other antecedents such as feminist identifi-cation and perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+. Therefore, themediator role of the strategic intra-minority alliance in the relation-ship between antecedents (e.g., identification, perceived discrimina-tion, privilege awareness) and solidarity-based collective action shouldbe examined in future studies.6 CONCLUSIONAcross three studies,we investigated the role of feminist identification,perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+, and endorsement of strate-gic intra-minority alliance between feminists and LGBTQ+ in hetero-sexual feminist women’s willingness to participate in solidarity-basedcollective action for LGBTQ+ rights. Our findings contribute to the lit-388 UYSAL ET AL.erature by showing the crucial link between privilege awareness andsolidarity between disadvantaged groups. We also believe that thecurrent article contributes to the debate on the lack of intersectionalapproaches and the critique of singular identity approaches in socialpsychology research by testing and discussing the contradictory rolesof the politicized disadvantaged and advantaged identities of the samegroup in solidarity-based collective action. We hope that our stud-ies may pave the way for intra-minority solidarity between them bydemonstrating how (1) multiple identities, (2) perceived discriminationagainst one’s own group and other disadvantaged groups, (3) endorse-ment of the strategic intra-minority alliance, and (4) privilege aware-ness of advantaged groups may become both facilitators of and barri-ers to solidarity-based collective action.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTOpen access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors report no conflicts of interest.ETHICAL APPROVALThese studies were approved by the Clark Committee for the Rights ofHuman Participants in Research and Training Programs (IRB) at ClarkUniversity and the Sciences & Technology Cross-Schools ResearchEthics Committee at the University of Sussex.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe anonymized raw data is publicly available via the Open Soci-ety Framework (OSF) webpage: https://osf.io/jup87/?view_only=df828303e92f40418a686954cfc82fa9.ORCIDMete SefaUysal https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8698-9213REFERENCESAcar, Y.G., &Uluğ,Ö.M.

    "abstract": "The current studies aim to examine the underlying predictors of heterosexual feminist women's willingness to participate in solidarity‐based collective action for LGBTQ+ rights. We hypothesized that feminist identification, perceived discrimination against LGBTQ+, and strategic intra‐minority alliance between feminists and LGBTQ+ would predict their willingness to participate in solidarity‐based collective action. Study 1 ( N = 141) showed that higher feminist identification and more endorsement of the strategic intra‐minority alliance predicted more willingness to participate in solidarity‐based collective action among heterosexual feminist women in Turkey. Study 2 ( N = 644) replicated and extended the findings of Study 1 with a larger sample by showing that higher awareness of sexual orientation privilege predicts more willingness to participate in solidarity‐based collective action. By following an intersectional and multi‐identity approach in Study 3 ( N = 280), we showed that higher feminist identification predicted more willingness to participate in solidarity‐based collective action, whereas higher heterosexual identification predicted less willingness",
