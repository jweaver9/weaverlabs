Tylenda*   Books containing LGBTQ+ themes and characters are being removed from public school libraries at a rapid rate across the United States. While a book challenge has made it to the Supreme Court once before, the resulting singular plurality opinion left courts without a clear test to apply, ultimately leaving students’ First Amendment rights in the air. Additionally, the increasingly relaxed view of courts towards religious influence in public schools indicates that if a modern case were to reach the Supreme Court, religious challenges may be accepted, which would leave LGBTQ+ students who seek to see themselves represented in literature without an avenue to do so. In light of this and other legislation harming LGBTQ+ students, in addition to studies indicating mental health concerns for LGBTQ+ youth, the best avenue to resolve this issue is to create a federal regulation separate from the courts. Students having access to literature that represents them or challenges them to learn about people different from themselves is essential to lessening mental challenges and inequalities faced by LGBTQ+ students and, without a standard that includes a formal review process for schools, the risk of detriment to mental health only increases. Others have sought to disregard the current plurality standard of review altogether in favor of a book removal test based on standards outlined in Wisconsin v. Yoder, while some have described that courts are utilizing Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, but reliance on the courts is difficult to ascertain considering the number of book challenges that go unreported and current religious influence.   This Article suggests that the most efficient way to rectify this issue is for the U.S. Department of Education to implement a funding-based regulation requiring that schools have a process of review, designating who is involved in that process, and requiring schools to provide a report of which books are removed at the end of each school year; if upon review the removals are found to be content- or viewpoint-based, the challenge must be revisited. Even though the Department cannot have direct oversight over school libraries and their book selection, it can establish regulations that make certain federal funding contingent on requisite programs and requirements that the schools can establish themselves. This Article seeks to add to the current debate over book bans and how they should be handled, especially when considering LGBTQ+ students, and provide a legal alternative for a remedy outside of the judicial system.    *  J.D.

These books gave Matilda a hopeful and comforting message; you are not alone.” --MATILDA, 19961   When children read books, they can formulate their own opinions and understandings of the world around them. Children can walk in the shoes of characters that look similar to themselves; but most often, they walk alongside characters startlingly different from them. Most children are not taking part in whaling voyages,2 wandering a post-cataclysmic world with one of their parents,3 or inheriting a candy factory after winning a golden ticket.4 By working with texts that challenge their everyday views and perspectives, children develop the ability to empathize, understand, and learn from others in a way that likely differs from their lived experiences, especially in seemingly homogenous communities.5  The concept of children learning from and about those different from themselves by reading is nothing new. Students have been reading classics as a portion of their education for decades through what scholars and teachers have dubbed “the canon.”6 And, as the world changes, so does the literature that is published and added to curriculums7 and school libraries. These new books portraying diverse characters and their perspectives are being heavily challenged, especially when they pertain to LGBTQ+ characters and themes.8 These direct challenges to literature are a portion of a larger problem facing LGBTQ+ students  1  MATILDA, at 6:50 (TriStar Pictures 1996). 2  See HERMAN MELVILLE, MOBY-DICK (Wordsworth Editions Ltd. 1993) (1851).  3  See CORMAC MCCARTHY, THE ROAD (Vintage Int’l 2007). 4  See ROALD DAHL, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (Puffin Books 2021) (1964). 5  See 5 Ways Books Boost Social Skills in Children, BOOK NOOK ENRICHMENT (June 1, 2022), https://booknooknyc.com/5-ways-books-boost-social-skills-in-children/; cf.

These problems, more broadly, are endangering students who are already more prone to bullying, discrimination, and worsened mental health than their heterosexual or cisgender peers.9  This Article argues that the importance of establishing more extensive protections for LGBTQ+ students and, more specifically, for protecting access to literature containing LGBTQ+ themes10 in school libraries is paramount to children’s well-being today. The increase in challenges to this literature, legal challenges for students across the United States, the lack of a clear legal standard, and an increasingly lenient interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause of the First Amendment render it necessary for the U.S. Department of Education to take action. The Department of Education may do so by creating a funding-contingent regulation that includes the skeleton of a procedural review process for public schools to independently implement, which would allow children to not only have an education in which they learn stellar math, science, and history but an education in which they also develop compassion for others different from themselves and become the best versions of themselves.  Part I of this Article will discuss the role of literature in education, the history of book challenges, and the current book challenges that are overwhelmingly aimed at LGBTQ+ literature. Part II will describe the current legal standard for addressing such challenges, why it needs clarification, and the fading secularism in public education that may create challenges if the issue returns to the Supreme Court. Part III will explore the importance of establishing protections for books containing LBGTQ+ characters and themes and currently proposed legislation that may aid in finding a solution. Part IV will propose potential remedies to mitigate harm by the U.S. Department of Education that are viewpoint and content-neutral, based on existing case law and respected international covenants.   I.   LITERATURE AND ITS HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC EDUCATION  A.

Historical Challenges to Literature   The American Library Association’s (“ALA”) Office of Intellectual Freedom has compiled data about challenged and banned books since 1990.20 It is important to consider the difference between the two terms, as a large percentage of books that are removed from school libraries and classrooms eventually return after lengthy review and debate; according to the ALA, most of what receives public attention are challenges, meaning someone, or a group of people, has objected to a  11  Helen Huus, The Role of Literature in Children’s Education, 50 EDUC.

Not all parents and families have the time or means to access public libraries, or to purchase books.”30   Even though the American Library Association and PEN America have varying interpretations of what it means for a book to be banned, the message is the same: removing access to books from school libraries places children in a position where they may not have access to the ideas at all.31  The modern concept of book censorship emerged in the 1920s and flourished in the 1960s and 1970s—going beyond banning books to burning them—when society “tested the bounds of social permissiveness.”32 The rise spiraled in the 1980s too.33  Similar to the notion that book banning in the United States is not new, challenges of literature with LGBTQ+ themes and characters34 are also not new. In the 1990s, Annie on My Mind35 was challenged on many accounts, some emerging from school libraries, because it “idealize[d] or encourage[d] homosexuality.”36 Ideas that challenged social norms were generally at the forefront of removal requests, even when unrelated to LGBTQ+ topics. For example, government restrictions flourished in Georgia in the 1940s and 1950s when the governor requested that certain books be removed from school libraries and burned for being “unfavorable to the South, the Bible, or the state of Georgia.”37 The restriction on literature in school libraries continues to grow in public schools across the country today.       30  Id. 31  See id.; Off. of Intell.

A Rise in Challenges Pertaining to LGBTQ+ Content  The ALA releases a list of the top ten most challenged books every year.38 In 2022, however, the ALA saw such a drastic increase in book challenges that the 2022 list includes thirteen books rather than the usual ten.39 The ALA’s “Top 13 Most Challenged Books of 2022” demonstrates that there has been an increase in the removal of literature pertaining to LGBTQ+ topics.40 In 2018, five of the eleven most challenged books faced scrutiny for this reason, and this number rose to eight of the top ten in 2019.41 Challenges in 2020 were outliers in that the year saw a decrease; only one book in the top ten was challenged for its LGBTQ+ content.42 Five out of the top ten most challenged books in 2021 were challenged due to LGBTQ+ content.43 Out of the thirteen most challenged books in 2022, seven were challenged for LGBTQ+ content. Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe44 was the most challenged book of 2022, taking the top spot for the second year in a row.45 All thirteen books in 2022 were “claimed to be sexually explicit.”46 In Florida alone, PEN America recorded 565 book bans in the 2021–22 school year; many of these challenges are hidden behind false reasoning, such as referring to some literature as “adult romance” when the books do not contain such content, resulting in removal on false pretenses.47 Examining 2022 as a whole, the ALA saw a record-breaking number of challenges, nearly doubling challenges from 2021 and the highest number of challenges since the documentation began over twenty years  38  Off. of Intell.

Jodi Picoult describes how in Martin County, Florida, twenty of her books were recently removed from school library shelves as part of a larger ban that removed eighty-four book titles. Picoult’s book Second Glance was removed as a part of this challenge by one parent, claiming “[t]his book is an Adult romance novel.” Picoult states, “[i]t’s worth noting, I do not write adult romance . . .

Much of this is heavily influenced by groups such as Moms for Liberty, a group PEN America has identified as having a large influence on book challenges and bans,61 which has chapters in Suffolk and Nassau counties on Long Island.62 An example of a book challenge that impacts LGBTQ+ students and themes can be seen in a recent lawsuit that emerged in Missouri during early 2022.63 A school district is being challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri (ACLU) on behalf of four students on the grounds that their book removal process directly violates students’ First Amendment rights.64 The school district’s policy, at the time of the lawsuit, imposed an automatic removal when books are challenged without first providing notice to students.65 The challenged book that sparked this lawsuit is centered around science, technology, engineering, and math and is meant for young children but was challenged by a parent in the school district because the book mentions a character’s non-binary identity on three of the book’s 307 pages. 66 At present, the policy allows any person to present a challenge to literature due to viewpoints expressed in the literature.67 The ACLU has challenged the policy, arguing that “the way the policy is written, ‘a parent, guardian, or student who  58  See, e.g., Sammy Gibbons, New York Introduces Trans Refuge Bill to Protect Children, Families, Doctors, DEMOCRAT & CHRON.

Silent Challenges   One of the obstacles in addressing book challenges and bans in school libraries is that the majority of the challenges are silent, meaning that they are unreported.71 It is estimated that about eighty-two to ninety-seven percent of book challenges are unreported, and therefore never face community or further legal scrutiny.72 This practice of book challenges going unreported remained an issue in 2022, as school districts continued to quietly challenge and sometimes temporarily or permanently remove books from school library shelves.73   Book challenges and removals that are unreported are just as significant as challenges that face community and legal scrutiny, as students from underrepresented backgrounds are still impacted. For some students, the ability to read books about real-life individuals or fictional characters that reflect their identities and/or experiences is potentially one of the only forms of representation they may have, which is important because studies have shown that representation allows students who are prone to feeling a sense of “otherness” to take pride in who they are and accept themselves.74 Considering the current statistics on the mental health of LBGTQ+ youth,75 it is paramount that these books stay on public library school shelves.   68  Id. 69  Id. 70  See id.; supra notes 10–18 and accompanying discussion.  71  See Nick Duffy, Library Books Are Still Being Censored Over LGBT+ Content on a Horrifying Scale.

A LACK OF CLARITY FOR LEGAL ACTION   A.  The Standard: Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico and the Court’s Role in School Libraries  For book challenges that are not silent, one significant problem in addressing whether a book has been rightfully removed from school library shelves is that the issue has only reached the Supreme Court of the United States in one instance: Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico (hereinafter “Pico”).76 The issue originated following the removal of literature from the District’s high school and junior high school libraries.77 Parents of students attended a conference held by a conservative organization which focused on education in New York; there they learned about books they later sought to remove from their school district’s library.78 When the parents brought this to the School Board’s attention, the books were promptly removed while Board members reviewed them; parents called the books “anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Sem[i]tic, and just plain filthy.”79 After an appointed committee reviewed the books based on certain criteria, it suggested that some of the books should be returned to the school libraries, while others remain off shelves, but the Board did not agree with the committee’s findings and drew its own conclusions, removing more than what was recommended, and providing no explanation as to why.80  Students filed a complaint on the basis that the actions of the Board violated their First Amendment rights.81 The district court did not agree with the students, determining that the Board’s actions were not based on religion, but rather on “conservative educational philosophy.”82 Due to the established precedent that gives school boards broad discretion in educational policymaking, the court did not wish to intervene and granted the Board’s motion for summary judgment, even though the removal “clearly was content-based.”83 On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed the district court’s judgment, remanding the case to trial.84 When this case made it to the Supreme Court on certiorari, the Court noted the case’s unique nature compared to previously decided cases about the constitutional limits on State control in the classroom: this case did not relate to  76  See 457 U.S. 853 (1982).  77  Id. at 856–57. 78  Id. 79  Id. at 857.

The district court acknowledged that the Board’s actions could “reflect a misguided educational philosophy” but still did not see a need to intervene. Id. 84  Id. at 860. 120 Indiana Journal of Law and Social Equality [12:109   120 textbooks required for curriculum, or required reading in general, for that matter.85 The substantive question the Court needed to address was whether the First Amendment placed any limitations on the discretion of the School Board.86 The Court utilized decades of precedent in agreeing “that local school boards must be permitted ‘to establish and apply their curriculum in such a way as to transmit community values,’ and that ‘there is a legitimate and substantial community interest in promoting respect for authority and traditional values be they social, moral, or political.’”87 The Court also recalled that school boards must exercise their discretion “in a matter that comports with the transcendent imperatives of the First Amendment.”88 The Court also discussed the role of the school library in students’ right to receive information. “The school library is the principal locus of such freedom.”89 The Court ultimately affirmed the decision of the Second Circuit and remanded the case to the district court because the motivations of the School Board potentially raised a genuine issue as to whether the procedure the School Board followed in removing books was outside the procedures already put in place and whether the review was conducted without bias.90 Part of the problem when considering the lasting effects of Pico is that it is a plurality opinion.91 Another problem is that there have been no other cases on this specific issue to reach the Supreme Court.92 As a result, this has left much discretion to lower courts, although most courts do follow Pico’s guidance.93 The plurality determined that the removal was problematic as the books were removed “simply because [school officials] dislike[d] the ideas contained in those books and  85  See id. at 861–62.

Kuhlmeier,99 which has “permitted courts to erode the Pico standard.”100 The confusing factor for courts, it seems, is the vague concept of “educational suitability.”101 While courts have articulated that suitability relies on the decision-making process itself—content-based reasoning versus politically-motivated reasoning—these concepts are closely knit, an issue Justice Rehnquist touched upon in his dissent.102 The Fifth Circuit provides an example in Campbell v. St. Tammany103 of “adopting a higher standard of review [than Pico] because of the non-curricular nature of book removals.”104 And the Eleventh Circuit in ACLU of Florida, Inc. v.

Des Moines107 would be more beneficial in deciding these matters as they reach courts.108 However, recent challenges, particularly in states that are seeing these kinds of suits, demonstrate that judges are still utilizing Pico to some extent.109   B.  The Need for Clarification in Light of Other Policies in Education  Sometimes the intent behind book challenges and removals goes beyond local school districts. Over the past two decades, there have been instances of state legislatures that have voted affirmatively for legislation that ultimately results in certain books being banned throughout the entire state’s public schools.110 While most states are not currently banning books containing LGBTQ+ topics, when one examines other contemporary acts of state legislation, it may not be incorrect to assume that the literature could be next, or that there are silent challenges already occurring. In Virginia, for example, new model codes for education proposed by Governor Youngkin would erode policies and protections for transgender students in Virginia public schools that had been established in 2020 by his predecessor, Governor Northam.111 The proposed changes would, amongst other things, require school staff only to use the student’s name that appears on their official record, unless provided with a note from their parents.112 The proposed bill requires that: Any person licensed as administrative or instructional personnel by the Board of Education and employed by a local school board who, in the scope of his employment, has reason to believe, as a result of direct communication from a student, . . . that such student is self-identifying as a gender that is different than his biological sex shall, as soon as practicable, contact at least one of such student's parents to ask whether such parent is aware of the student's mental state and  106  See id. at 1202. 107  393 U.S. 503 (1969).  108  See Schroeder, supra note 92, at 383–86. 109  See, e.g., T.K. ex rel.

One school district in the state attempted a form of silent challenge119 when it nearly destroyed thirty-five newly purchased copies of Fun Home by Alison Bechdel,120 amongst other literature, rather than let them be introduced to classrooms.121 The Oklahoma Senate introduced a bill that would require students to use multiple occupancy restrooms exclusively aligned with their biological sex, although granting some “reasonable” accommodations.122 If enacted, schools would not be  113  H.B. 2432, 2023 Leg., Reg.

States such as California have, conversely, introduced and passed legislation that expressly protects them.128 The California Education Code now “prohibits discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on the actual or perceived characteristics . . . [of] gender, gender identity, gender expression, . . . [and] sexual orientation.”129 Additionally, California requires that all activities that are typically segregated by sex, such as sports, be available to students in a manner consistent with their gender identity.130 It is incredibly important to celebrate these victories for LGBTQ+ students, but it is essential to consider that students often do not get to choose the state in which they  contemplate suicide.” Whitaker v.

C.  The Fading Nature of a Secular Public Education and its Judicial Implications   Given the nature of general challenges facing LGBTQ+ students and the challenges directly facing representative literature, one may point toward the plurality opinion in Pico and its stance that books should not be removed based on their ideas if those ideas are challenged on the basis of religious ideals and other “matters of opinion.”133 Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit deems a removal improper when the sole focus of discontent with the literature is its ideas.134 This interpretation presents an optimistic outlook for literature challenged based on religion in public schools only to some extent. Just as book challenges are on the rise across the country, so is a more lenient judicial understanding of the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment,135 potentially endangering these secular interpretations of how a book challenge should be addressed.  For example, the Kansas District Court in the Tenth Circuit ruled in favor of religious liberties when up against school policies intended to provide students with privacy in Richard v. USD 475 Geary County.136 The plaintiff, a teacher, argued that her withholding of any information, such as preferred names and pronouns, from parents when communicating with them under the school district’s Communication with Parents Policy violated her religious beliefs due to how her  131  Cf.

Bremerton School District.140 The court differentiated this decision from precedent by establishing that unlike other determinations involving prayers at public school football games, the students who joined in the coach’s post-game prayers, in this case, were not coerced in any way and the prayers were not “broadcast or recited to a captive audience.”141 However, the dissent identifies numerous points that the majority seemingly overlooked, such as the inherent and unique coercion that students face and the coach’s history of inviting others to join in his prayers, ultimately stating that “[t]his decision does a disservice to schools and the young citizens they serve, as well as to our Nation's longstanding commitment to the separation of church and state.”142 These decisions render it difficult to believe that if a book challenge based on religion were to reach the Supreme Court today it would be struck down. While it should certainly be considered that all families should be able to have access to public education, for families that have deep religious viewpoints that they feel conflict with certain ideas in public schools, such as those contained in challenged books, one should also consider the growing school choice movement that may allow children to attend religious institutions for free in many states.143 While many supporters of the separation of church and state are frustrated with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Carson ex rel C. O. v. Makin, which held that states with voucher  137  See id. at *1–6. 138  See id. at *9–10. 139  Id. at *13. Further, the court found the argument that the district’s option of never referring to students by the name or pronoun inadequate when held against the plaintiff’s religiously held belief toward concealment, as the plaintiff also believes “parents have a fundamental right to control the upbringing of their children,” and the plaintiff could still accidentally make a remark and face discipline.

III.   CONSIDERATIONS FOR EFFICIENTLY AND QUICKLY CODIFYING MORE EXTENSIVE PROTECTIONS FOR LGBTQ+ STUDENTS AND LITERATURE  A.  A Current Lack of Federal Protections for Students  Legal standards concerning books remain unclear, but there is hope for other relevant legal protections for LGBTQ+ students that would impact their ability to thrive at school. This being said, the proposed legislation that aims to create a safer school environment and curb discrimination remains stalled.145 For example, the Safe Schools Improvement Act was proposed in early July of 2021 but has not proceeded through the House in over a year, having been referred to the House Committee on Education and Labor.146 The Safe Schools Improvement Act would require all fifty states “to direct their local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish policies that prevent and prohibit bullying and harassment of elementary and secondary school students. In particular, these policies must prohibit bullying and harassment based on race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religion.”147 Additionally, LEAs would be required to advise all individuals within their schools of prohibited conduct on an annual basis, provide an avenue for parents and students to submit grievances, and provide public information on how frequently prohibited conduct occurred within individual schools and districts.148 This, alongside the Equality Act, could provide greater protection for LGBTQ+ students. The Equality Act has witnessed more movement through the legislative process than the Safe Schools Improvement Act, having been introduced in the  144  Carson ex rel. O. C. v. Makin, 142 S. Ct. 1987 (2022). As an aside, the dissents in this opinion are painstakingly clear about the increasingly lenient application of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause in recent years, with Justice Sotomayor writing “[w]hat a difference five years makes. In 2017, I feared that the Court was ‘lead[ing] us . . . to a place where separation of church and state is a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment.’ . . . Today, the Court leads us to a place where separation of church and state becomes a constitutional violation.” Id. at 2014 (2022) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Even more relevant, here, is the dissents’ recollection that as the Supreme “Court has long recognized, the Establishment clause requires that public education be secular and neutral as to religion.” Id. If the majority is already eroding this standard of separation in this fashion, it is likely that books opposed on religious grounds stand little chance.  145  See Safe Schools Improvement Act, H.R. 4332, 117th Cong. (2021); Equality Act, H.R. 5, 117th Cong. (2021). 146  Safe Schools Improvement Act, H.R. 4332, 117th Cong. (2021). 147  Id. 148  See id. 128 Indiana Journal of Law and Social Equality [12:109   128 House of Representatives and passed a week later in February 2021.149 However, it has not seen any movement in the Senate since mid-March of 2021.150 The Equality Act would provide an explicit prohibition towards “discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in areas including . . . education.”151 If this bill were to become law, an individual would be guaranteed access to a shared facility, such as a locker room or restroom, that aligns with their gender identity, and the Department of Justice would be able to intervene in federal courts where there are equal protection actions concerning sexual orientation or gender identity.152 This would aid students facing issues with a lack of access to gender-affirming spaces tremendously, as numerous students have encountered what may feel like lengthy litigation proceedings on this account alone.153  B.  Why LGBTQ+ Students and Their Books Need Further Protection  The importance of expanding federal protections for LBGTQ+ students and books that represent them in the wake of harmful legislation comes in part because LGBTQ+ youth face a disproportionate rate of victimization, suicide ideation/attempts, and more mental health challenges than their heterosexual and cisgender peers.154 This is critical, as bullying dramatically affects a child’s ability to participate in their education actively and meaningfully:  [t]he National Institute of Child Health reports that . . . [m]ore than two-thirds of students report general bullying as an ongoing problem in their school, about 1 in 10 students drops out or changes schools because of repeated bullying, and more than 1 in 10 report school absences because of fear of bullying.155  These rates of bullying increase when applied to students who self-identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community.156  From September to December of 2021, The Trevor Project157 conducted a national survey to measure the mental health trends of LGBTQ+ youth and  149  See Equality Act, H.R. 5, 117th Cong. (2021). 150  Id. 151  Id. 152  Id.  153  See, e.g., N.H. v. Anoka-Hennepin Sch. Dist. No. 11, 950 N.W.2d 553 (Minn. Ct. App. 2020) (time elapsed from filing of complaint to remand on appeal was over a year).  154  See Joseph P. Robinson & Dorothy L.

Press 7th ed.2020). 156  See Robinson & Espelage, supra note 154, at 320–21. 157  The Trevor Project is an organization that hosts a crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth, engages in advocacy and research, and works with public education institutions to help individuals and educators understand the needs of LGBTQ+ youth. Explore Trevor, TREVOR PROJECT, https://www.thetrevorproject.org/explore/ (last  2024] Banned Books & Banned Identities  129  129  successfully collected the experiences of 34,000 individuals aged thirteen to twenty-four.158 The survey results indicate that LGBTQ+ youth face high levels of physical harm and/or threats.159 For LGBTQ+ youth who attempted suicide in the year leading up to the survey, the rates were more than double for youth who received or experienced physical threats and/or harm than those youth who did not have those experiences.160 Additionally, during the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Pew Research Center found that LGB students faced more than double the number of mental health stressors than their heterosexual classmates, which courts are noticing.161 These concerns were part of the focus of hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the Committee on Oversight and Reform during the 117th Congress.162 In the second portion of this session, a high school teacher from Kentucky testified that he had received many text messages from suicidal students who identified as LGBTQ+ saying their goodbyes, and that “[f]orty-five percent of LGBTQ youth seriously considered suicide this year. We chip away at their dignity and spaces to exist. The systems meant to protect them will not even acknowledge them.”163 A parent from Florida also testified, discussing how the new legislation in Florida may create a rise in the bullying of her non-binary child and a loss of support staff at her child’s public school.164   visited Jan. 17, 2023). Through its public education initiatives, the Trevor Project has provided various trainings to educators, created over 20,000 safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth across the United States, and is the first organization of this nature in the nation to form an official partnership with the New York Department of Education.

Without these things, students may not be focusing on their studies or reaching their full academic potential.168 Some could argue that losing access to books is not truly an issue because courts continue to uphold other protections for students such as upholding a public school district’s policy that enables transgender students to use school facilities that align with their gender identities under the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX.169 This is particularly relevant because, in celebration of fifty years since its enactment, the U.S. Department of Education released proposed changes to Title IX and opened a forum for public comment in June 2022.170 The U.S. Department of Education cited the Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County as a metric in the creation of these changes; discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender inherently discriminates against an individual based on sex.171 In sum, the proposed changes would further allow students who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community to be themselves and provide refuge from retribution in the event they bring grievances under Title IX.172  165  See 2022 National Youth Survey on LGBTQ Mental Health, supra note 74, at 20. When asked whether home or school was an LGBTQ-affirming space, 37% identified home as LGBTQ-affirming, while 55% identified school as such. Similarly, 32% of transgender and non-binary youth identified home as gender-affirming, which is less than the 51% who identified school as a gender-affirming space.

Ct. 1731 (2020).  172  See Proposed Changes to Title IX Regulations, supra note 170.  2024] Banned Books & Banned Identities  131  131  While this seems like progress, as we have seen from the examples of legislation in Virginia, South Dakota, and Oklahoma, this is not as straightforward as those celebrating these proposed regulations might envision because there seems to be a growing barrier for federally binding action.173 In Ohio, for example, the State Board of Education has proposed that it will not follow those newly proposed Title IX regulations if they are adopted, and a federal judge has temporarily blocked the Department of Education’s guidance to explicitly protect transgender students via a preliminary injunction in twenty states.174 This makes the protection of literature critically important.  IV.  POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS & MITIGATING HARM  As discussed in Part II, the lack of a clear legal standard and an increasingly relaxed Supreme Court concerning religion in public education may spell disappointment for anyone who hopes a case concerning book challenges will reach the Court soon.175 This leaves the solution in the hands of the legislature and federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Education. Although these options have their drawbacks, they may have a higher chance of being successful in the current judicial climate. This Part will seek to address a potential solution to ensure that LGBTQ+ students have access to literature that represents them in public school libraries by first describing the drawbacks, then considering international covenants, and lastly, proposing a path forward.   A.  The Lack of Power of the Federal Government in Public Education   Historically the federal government has had a limited role in the nation’s public education. Even states hold somewhat of a limited role, as education is mostly led by local districts.176 The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  173  See supra notes 110–27 and accompanying text.  174  See David Rees & Kevin Freeman, Top Ohio School Board Considers Resolution Blocking LGBTQ+ Protections, FOX 8 NEWS (Sept. 20, 2022, 10:25 PM), https://fox8.com/news/top-ohio-school-board-considers-resolution-blocking-lgbtq-protections/; Tennessee v.

Those heavily invested in whether this issue will soon reach the Supreme Court again are currently keeping their eyes on a recent lawsuit jointly filed by PEN America, multiple authors, and Penguin Random House LLC in response to book bans imposed throughout a Florida School District, who, along with the School Board, has not followed its existing review process and disproportionately targeted books about or written by LGBTQ+ individuals. See generally Compl., PEN America v. Escambia Cty. Sch. Dist., (2023) (No. 3:23-cv-10385).  176  See 20 U.S.C. § 3403(a) (The establishment of the Department of Education shall not increase the authority of the Federal Government over education or diminish the responsibility for education which is reserved to the States and the local school systems and other instrumentalities of the States.”); see also Brandon Pelsue, When it Comes to Education, the Federal Government is in Charge of . . . Um, What?,  132 Indiana Journal of Law and Social Equality [12:109   132 1965177 transformed this to some extent, by “offer[ing] states funding for education programs on a conditional basis.”178 In 1979, President Carter helped establish the U.S. Department of Education which, moving forward, coordinated the growing amount of federal law applicable to education.179 When the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act180 was enacted in the early 2000s, federal oversight of education peaked, with one Secretary of Education attempting to utilize it to further federalize education via waiver after the NCLB expired in 2007.181 Certain aspects of the NCLB were kept when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was reauthorized in 2015 as the Every Student Succeeds Act,182 and the federal government’s involvement in public education was at a high.183 However, since the Trump Administration, the federal government’s involvement in education has decreased, with some in Congress moving to abolish the U.S. Department of Education as a whole.184 This is not the first time that the Department has faced such scrutiny; after Andrew Johnson created a Department of Education in 1867, it was demoted to the Office of Education in 1968 “due to the concern that the Department would exercise too much control over local schools.”185 This makes taking any federal action difficult, but it still seems to be the most promising step.   B.  International Perspectives for Potential Remedies  One avenue to explore when considering the implementation of protections for and needs of students is international covenants containing aspects of education that the United States has agreed to follow.186 One example is the United  HARVARD ED.

It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.190 This provision of Article 26 provides the strongest support out of the entirety of the UDHR for added protections for LGBTQ+ students in America’s public schools.191 Additionally, the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner has stated that it should be a goal to be as inclusive as possible to LGBTQ+ students in educational settings so that individuals are not left behind.192  The language of the UDHR does provide an optimistic outlook at first glance, but the explicit absence of gender identity, sex, and sexual orientation in the second sentence does add a significant difficulty: the promotion of tolerance and understanding that countries following the UDHR need not  rights#:~:text=The%20Universal%20Declaration%20is%20not,members%20of%20the%20international%20community, (last visited Mar. 17, 2023) (discussing the legal difference between an international treaty and a covenant). 187  UNITED NATIONS, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights, (last visited Oct. 3, 2022); Allida Black, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, NAT’L PARKS SERV.

One could argue that “the full development of the human personality” could mean that children should be able to display—and learn about—their full selves, which includes their gender identity and sexual orientation. If this argument is to be taken at face value, it would mean that institutions within public education would need to protect students, regardless of their identities, to the fullest extent. Additionally, when one considers the role of literature in a child’s development, this would also mean that public schools would need to allow all themes and types of characters to an age-appropriate extent in order to allow children to develop their fullest human personality. This also builds on the aspect of tolerance in the second portion of the provision.  192  The Inclusion of LGBT People in Education Settings; Of Paramount Importance to “Leaving No One Behind,” UNITED NATIONS: HUM.

Potential Paths Forward to Maintain Access to Literature   The best path forward to resolving any uncertainty caused by the unclear judicial standards and protecting children’s access to representative literature in public education is through the Department of Education.   While the inherent design of the U.S. Department of Education does not permit federal participation in education to supplant that of state and local control, especially when it comes to the selection of materials that may be available in school libraries, the Department has found a way to increasingly play a role in public schools throughout the United States—funding.198 The Department has influenced education through conditional federal funding through successful regulations such as The Family and Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1874199  193  See Universal Declaration of Human Rights, supra note 187; Sharon Yecies, Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 11 CHI. J. INT’L L. 789, 803 (2011). 194  See Yecies, supra note 193, at 803–05.  195  See generally McKenna Deutsch, Note, Burned, Banned, and Censored: The Need for an International Framework that Addresses the Right to Read, 39 WIS. INT’L L. J. 329 (2022) (Deutsch argues that the United Nations should declare the right to read a fundamental right because existing treaties and the work of non-governmental actors do not sufficiently address and protect this right). 196  See id. at 342–43; Lea Shaver, The Right to Read, 54 COLUM. J. TRANSNAT’L L. 1, 5 (2015); see also Maeve McDonagh, The Right to Information in International Human Rights Law, 13 HUM. RTS. L. REV. 25, 26 (2013). 197  See Deutsch, supra note 195, at 349; see also David Langlet, Unfolding from Nonexistence: The Dynamic but Contested Evolution of LGBT-Human Rights, 55 SCANDINAVIAN STUD. L. 339, 344 (2010). 198  1 EDUCATION LAW § 3.1(3) (2022).  199  See generally Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g (2013). 2024] Banned Books & Banned Identities  135  135  and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.200 Additionally, reports demonstrate that state laws are contributing to the increase in book bans, meaning that a federal avenue is necessary.201 In all likelihood, then, the best and most feasible solution for addressing the rise in book removals across the United States would be for the Department of Education to implement review procedures and safeguards that correspond with public school funding.   In light of this, the Department of Education should establish a regulation that either provides additional funding to the nation’s public schools or makes the receipt of some federal funding conditional on implementing a new procedural review process for library books. Federal education code states:  No provision of a program administered by the Secretary or by any other officer of the Department shall be construed to authorize the Secretary or any such officer to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system, over any accrediting agency or association, or over the selection or content of library resources, textbooks, or other instructional materials by any educational institution or school system, except to the extent authorized by law.202 However, a new regulation by the Department need not “exercise any direction, supervision, or control . . . over the selection or content of library resources.”203 By reinforcing principles readily upheld by the courts and explicitly written in the Constitution, the Department does not have to take control, it only needs to ensure state and local education agencies adhere to a skeleton of a procedure.   Without overstepping established boundaries, the Department of Education could create a regulation that expands upon and formalizes Pico. This could be a part, or an addition to, President Biden’s Education Department coordinator, a new position the President intends to tackle the banned book epidemic in schools.204 As mentioned in Part II.A, one of the largest roadblocks courts have faced in  200  See 1 EDUCATION LAW § 3.1(3) (2022) (discussing how these regulations have successfully implemented new standards or services for students by making additional funding conditional on implementing these regulations or by making continued funding contingent on their implementation); see generally Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Pub. L. No. 108-446, 118 Stat. 2647 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 20 U.S.C.). 201 See Eesha Pendharkar, State Laws Are Behind Many Book Bans, Even Indirectly, Report Finds, EDUC.

The report, compiled by PEN America, “found that 31 percent of book bans in the last six months of 2022 were connected to legislation passed in three states: Florida, Utah, and Missouri.” Id.  202  20 U.S.C. § 3403(b). 203  Id. 204  Bo Erickson, Biden Administration to Appoint Anti-book Ban Coordinator as Part of New LGBTQ Protections, CBS NEWS (June 8, 2023), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-anti-book-ban-coordinator-new-lgbtq-protections/.  136 Indiana Journal of Law and Social Equality [12:109   136 considering the removal of books is the lack of clarity of “educational suitability.”205 The Department should build upon this by utilizing guidelines such as Scholastic’s Age Groups, as Scholastic is well known for its school book fairs and is America’s largest publisher for children’s books.206 Scholastic’s Age Groups are four categories based on what is developmentally appropriate and an appropriate reading level for children.207 This regulation should also require that districts either adopt the American Library Association’s Library Bill of Rights208 or create a district-specific policy that is similar in nature.209 The UDHR can be utilized here, too, as a portion of the requirement can be derived from Article 26, specifically the notion that “[e]ducation shall be directed to the full development of the human personality.”210  After establishing firmer guidelines, not absolutes, about what is suitable, the Department can keep with the well-established role of parental choice in education211 by creating a uniform way that parents can request books be reviewed, and strongly encouraging that school districts require that parents affirm that they  205  See Free Speech Under Attack (Part II), supra note 162, Part A and accompanying notes; Bd. of Educ., Island Trees Union Free Sch.

While this is terrific news, as discussed throughout this Article, children most likely cannot dictate in which state their family resides, and some families do not have the resources or abilities to move to states enacting similar legislation.  209  At the time this Article was written, two states had proposed state regulations similar in nature in that public school libraries must adopt the Library Bill of Rights or see a loss of funding: Illinois and New Jersey.

The bill directly states: “It is further declared to be the policy of the State to encourage and protect the freedom of libraries and library systems to acquire materials without external limitation and to be protected against attempts to ban, remove, or otherwise restrict access to books or materials.” H.B. 2789, 103d Gen. Assemb. (Ill. 2023). 210  See Universal Declaration of Human Rights, supra note 187, at Article 26 ¶ 2. 211  See generally Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) (establishing parents have a right to direct the education of their children).  2024] Banned Books & Banned Identities  137  137  are challenging only books that they have read before submitting a challenge.212 Additionally, the Department should also recommend that the procedures limit the number of books that may be challenged by one parent at a time; the more books that are challenged at a time, the less time can be dedicated to seriously considering the qualities and merits of a book. This is a necessary recommendation considering the ALA Office of Intellectual Freedom’s statistics that indicate that of the challenged books in 2022, “90% were part of attempts to censor multiple titles. Of the books challenged, 40% were in cases involving 100 or more books.”213 As Jodi Picoult states in a TikTok concerning the removal of her literature from Florida schools, “[t]here is absolutely nothing wrong with a parent deciding a certain book is not right for [their] child. There is a colossal problem with a parent deciding that therefore, no child should be allowed to read that book.”214  The next portion of the regulation should establish that school boards create a review panel, which should, at a minimum, contain the school district’s librarians, the superintendent, and several parents and teachers, the number of which could be dependent on the size of the district. While this panel reviews challenges, the regulation should require that challenged books remain on select library shelves so that parents unopposed to the book can grant permission to their children to read them until they are either returned to general shelves or officially removed by the panel. This panel should be encouraged by the regulation to have an appeal process.   The last aspect, and arguably most important, is that the school districts should be required to file a report consisting of the number of titles removed, if any, the titles, and general reasoning for their removal at the conclusion of each school year. This does not permit the Department any control over the school libraries themselves and ensures that students are afforded a more thorough review of the literature. Moreover, this also allows the Department to ensure that school districts are not burdening their students’ First Amendment rights, as the Court in Pico emphasized that this is an important factor.215 If, for example, the Department discovered that a district repeatedly violated students’ First Amendment rights and removed books on behalf of a motive other than educational suitability (i.e., religious values or politics),216 the regulation could permit a loss of federal funding if the book is not discussed again by the panel.   212  This recommendation would be in school districts’ best interest because when parents are able to challenge books without reading them, they can overwhelmingly challenge an abundance of literature at one time, often resulting in “chaos as principals do not have the time to do their job and read all that material.” PEN America (@penamerica), supra note 47.  213  Record Number of Demands, supra note 48. 214  PEN America (@penamerica), supra note 47.  215  See supra note 88 and accompanying text; Bd. of Educ., Island Trees Free Union Sch. Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 864 (1982). 216  This is an important consideration because the influx of challenges in 2022 displayed clear motives. The director of the ALA Office of Intellectual Freedom “said in an interview [on March 23, 2023] ‘. . . We’re seeing a campaign by politically partisan groups to remove vast swaths of books that don’t meet their agenda, whether that’s a political or religious  or moral agenda.’” Alexandra Alter & Elizabeth A. Harris, Attempts to Ban Books Doubles in 2022, N.Y. TIMES (March 23, 2023), https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/books/book-ban-2022.html.  138 Indiana Journal of Law and Social Equality [12:109   138  This regulation is neutral in that it allows students from various walks of life more of an opportunity for representative literature to remain on school library shelves. It does not take away the important role that communities have developed in their school districts. Rather, it ensures that these two interests are balanced and can be checked if needed.   CONCLUSION    The path forward seems daunting in the absence of a clear legal test for book challenges in public school libraries and in light of the growing religious movement in the public sphere. While courts should work to establish a more uniform test to address challenged literature, the current judicial climate does not indicate that this would be the best route forward, especially considering the concurrent rise in other anti-LGBTQ+ legislation affecting school children. Given the data that demonstrates the saddening state of mental health for LGBTQ+ youth, it could be detrimental to wait for another book challenge to reach the Supreme Court, where it is likely a religious challenge might be deemed acceptable.  Even with a historically limited role in the nation’s education, the federal government may be able to protect students’ well-being and maintain a secular public education by taking cues from international treaties, signed by the United States, and by amending proposed legislation or establishing a viewpoint and content-neutral federal review procedure for challenged literature. The Department of Education has a large impact on how children can participate and learn through their education, and it is time they use their impact to protect a secular education and a child’s ability to read books that are representative of them and those they may interact with throughout their lives.

    "abstract": "Books containing LGBTQ+ themes and characters are being removed from public school libraries at a rapid rate across the United States. While a book challenge has made it to the Supreme Court once before, the resulting singular plurality opinion left courts without a clear test to apply, ultimately leaving students’ First Amendment rights in the air. Additionally, the increasingly relaxed view of courts towards religious influence in public schools indicates that if a modern case were to reach the Supreme Court, religious challenges may be accepted, which would leave LGBTQ+ students who seek to see themselves represented in literature without an avenue to do so. In light of this and other legislation harming LGBTQ+ students, in addition to studies indicating mental health concerns for LGBTQ+ youth, the best avenue to resolve this issue is to create a federal regulation separate from the courts. Students having access to literature that represents them or challenges them to learn about people different from themselves is essential to lessening mental challenges and inequalities faced by LGBTQ+ students and, without a standard that includes a formal review process for schools, the risk of detriment to mental health only increases. Others have sought to disregard the current plurality standard of review altogether in favor of a book removal test based on standards outlined in Wisconsin v. Yoder, while some have described that courts are utilizing Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, but reliance on the courts is difficult to ascertain considering the number of book challenges that go unreported and current religious influence.\nThis Article suggests that the most efficient way to rectify this issue is for the U.S. Department of Education to implement a funding-based regulation requiring that schools have a process of review, designating who is involved in that process, and requiring schools to provide a report of which books are removed at the end of each school year; if upon review the removals are found to be content- or viewpoint-based, the challenge must be revisited. Even though the Department cannot have direct oversight over school libraries and their book selection, it can establish regulations that make certain federal funding contingent on requisite programs and requirements that the schools can establish themselves. This Article seeks to add to the current debate over book bans and how they should be handled, especially when considering LGBTQ+ students, and provide a legal alternative for a remedy outside of the judicial system",
