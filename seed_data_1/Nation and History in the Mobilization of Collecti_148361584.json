Spencer\nPomona College\nAbstract\nSocial movement theories are often built on Western and US-centric understandings \nof civic life and the values that underpin it. Studying participation in the LGBT move-\nment in Prague, Czech Republic provides one context for complicating such underlying \nassumptions. Within theory on mobilization, collective identity is said to act as a conduit \nfor developing personal investment through individuals’ identities. Interviews with LGBT \npeople in Prague, however, show that there is little sense of or desire for collective identity \namong these potential participants. Czech national history contextualizes respondents’ dis-\ntinct descriptions of the role of civic life and activism, value of private life, and contempo-\nrary situation for LGBT people in Prague. Drawing from these descriptions, and an analysis \nof the influence of values on movement participation in the Czech Republic and other CEE \ncountries, I argue that nation and history complicate the application of collective identity for \nmobilization in Prague’s LGBT movement.\nKeywords\ncollective identity, mobilization, social movements, Czech Republic, LGBT\nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n6 6 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nIn the social movement sub-field of sociology, participation is often understood \nthrough Western and US-centric understandings of the role of civic life and activism. \nWhile social movements and engagement with this form of the public sphere can be \nfound across different cultural experiences, the predominate role of Western European \nand US based movements in this field has shaped the values that underline its theoretical \ncontributions. Studying participation in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \n(LGBT) movement in Prague, Czech Republic provides one context for destabilizing \nthose underlying assumptions. \nWithin social movement theory on mobilization, collective identity is often \ndiscussed as a way people are mobilized into movement participation. Yet, developing a \ncollective identity among LGBT Czechs, particularly in relationship to Prague’s LGBT \nmovement, is deterred by the role collective identity played in controlling and denying \npeople’s freedom in Czech national history, in particular the communist period from \n1948 to 1989. What resonates more than a collective identity are the values of personal \nfreedom and privacy that emerged in response to this history. These values have shaped \nhow Czech LGBT people view their contemporary situation and the role activism should \nplay in addressing their experiences as LGBT people. \nDrawing from interviews with twenty LGBT people living in Prague, along with \nan analysis of movement participation and values in the Czech Republic and other \nCentral-Eastern European (CEE) countries from the European Social Survey (ESS), I \nargue that nation and history interfere with the application of collective identity as a tool \nfor mobilization in Prague’s LGBT movement. A nation and its particular history shapes \nthe values that underlie how people understand the role of identity, activism, and public \nlife, which are all critical for the emergence of collective identity and thus impact social \nmovement mobilization. This is mirrored in the Czech LGBT movement’s struggle to \nmobilize participation, as expressed by respondents involved in LGBT organizations, and \nas evident in the ESS analysis of mobilization in the Czech Republic more generally. \nThe argument for this paper is presented in five sections, beginning with two \ntheoretical sections, first in social movement mobilization theory and then in the history \nof LGBT people in the Czech Republic. These are followed by a section on Data and \nMethods, and then the analysis section. The latter takes up both the interviews with \nLGBT people living in Prague and the quantitative exploration of ESS data on the \nCzech Republic and other CEE countries. Lastly, a conclusion section ties the arguments \npresented throughout the paper together into a call for further study of identity-based \nmovements in non-Western countries. \nCollective Identity in Social Movement Mobilization\nWithin social movement theory on mobilization, this paper looks specifically at \ncollective identity, which often comes up as a way potential participants are mobilized \ninto participation. Collective identity is said to mobilize participants by acting as \na conduit for developing personal investment in individuals’ identities and leading \nto sustained movement participation. Mobilization processes are critical for a social \nmovement to succeed on the whole, for as Munson (2008) states, “activists simply don’t \nmobilize themselves” (p. 189). Without a strong set of participants working towards the \ncause, a social movement will be weakened in its ability to make an impact or even be \nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 6 7\nheard. In this section I briefly discuss some of the literature on collective identity in social \nmovement mobilization in order to unpack its reliance on Western conceptions of civic \nparticipation and the boundary work of identity politics.\nCollective Identity’s Uses in Mobilization\nIn the mobilization literature, collective identity can either be pre-existing or \ncreated by the movement. Simon, Trötschel, and Dähne (2008) conceptualize these \ntwo roles as either a “push” to participate from membership in a pre-existing collective \nidentity or a “pull” to participate in order to gain an attractive collective identity: “In \nthe first case I already occupy a place or position in the social world which makes \nparticipation for me the natural thing to do. In the second case I am still on my way \nto that place” (p. 945). This “first case” is more documented and most relevant to our \ndiscussion of how the possession of a collective identity would influence mobilization. In \nthis case, a collective identity serves an as already united group that can be mobilized by \nconnecting membership to the collective identity o participation in a movement. This \nrole is based on the idea that “one of the most powerful motivators of individual action \nis the desire to confirm through behavior a cherished identity” (Friedman & McAdam, \n1992, p. 169). \nThe desire to claim a “social attachment and new sense of identity” provides the \nincentive that movements capitalize on to mobilize participation (Friedman & McAdam, \n1992, p. 157). This works largely because of the process of “identity affirmation.” Simon \net al.’s (2008) work describes the power of collective identity to mobilize people based \non its relationship to “a sense of inner obligation to enact one’s collective identity” (p. \n935-936). They connect this inner obligation to the process of identity affirmation, which \nis where participating or acting in agreement with a desired collective identity allows an \nindividual to affirm their personal identity as a member of the collective (p. 936). Identity \naffirmation is motivated by the fact that identities in general are rarely stable or able to be \npermanently ‘attained,’ and thus require ongoing work on the part of the individual to \naffirm to themselves and others that they indeed possess a certain identity (p. 936).\nBoundary Work in Collective Identity\nEither way they use or deploy it, using collective identity for mobilization \nnecessitates framing and boundary work in order to establish who is part of this identity \nand who is not (Haenfler, 2012). This turn follows Polletta and Jasper’s (2001) call for \ngreater attention to the tools and formative materials by which collective identity is \nconstructed, and begins to direct our attention towards the assumptions that underlie this \ntool for mobilization. Friedman and McAdam (1992) argue for the necessity of boundary \nwork in building a collective identity, stating, “In order to reward participants by \nconferring this identity, it has to be possible simultaneously to exclude non-participants \nfrom adopting the identity” (p. 165). One example of how boundary work reified a \ncollective identity in the context of a social movement is Taylor and Whittier’s (1992) \nstudy of the US lesbian feminist movement, where they found that while boundaries are \n“central” to forming collective identity in that they promote a sense of commonality and \n“frame interaction between members of the in-group and the out-group,” they depend \non the incorporation of relevant cultural values in a specific context, even as these may \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n6 8 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nbe external to what a movement seeks to create (p. 111). \nBoundary work within collective identity always takes place in a specific cultural \ncontext. As Jasper (2008) argues, fixing the boundaries of a collective identity’s \nmembership relies on both member and nonmember perceptions of the group. In \nother words, collective identity has to locate itself in the existing “system of relations,” \nit cannot attempt to “construct its identity independently of its recognition…by other \nsocial and political actors” (Melucci, 1995, p. 47-48). All identity is constructed through \ninteractions with other people (Jasper, 2008, p. 88). This interaction between members \nand non-members therefore invests a collective identity with externally-constructed \ndefinitions. Whittier (2002) argues that this relationship shapes how a movement \nproduces meaning as well, pointing to the influence of forces from both the internal \n(movement culture, discourse, individual identities) and external (hegemonic culture, \noppositional discourse, emotion cultures and norms) (p. 293). Collective identities are in \npart dictated by the terms of the existing system, which is shaped by contemporary and \nhistorical power.\nLimitations of Using Collective Identity in Mobilization\nOne limitation that emerges from the assumptions and implications of using \ncollective identity as a tool for mobilization is the constraining dialogic nature of a \nmarginalized group’s collective identity and the dominant societal narratives. Minow \n(1980) calls this the “dilemma of difference” (p. 20). This dilemma is the challenge of \ntrying to stop the exclusion of a group that was constructed out of difference “without \nemploying and, in that sense, legitimating those very differences” (p. 47). Another other \nkey limitation is provided by queer theory, which suggests that in movements that seek \nto destabilize fixed notions of identity, collective identity is difficult if not incompatible \n(Gamson, 1995). Owens et al. (2010) references Gamson’s argument and connects it to a \npoint that mirrors Minow’s (1980) “dilemma of difference,” stating that “boundary work \nregarding collective identities such as race, gender, and sexuality can sometimes vacillate \nbetween taking on the goal of deconstructing boundaries and taking on the goal of fixing \nthe boundaries to mobilize on the basis of them” (p. 491). \nUses of collective identity must be contextualized in relationship to the role power \nhas played in shaping marginalized identities in relationship to norms and values. Given \nthese limitations, the costs of a collective identity might out-weigh the benefits it has \nfor mobilizing, and therefore may not be a productive, valuable or appropriate tool for \ncertain groups. Jasper and McGarry (2015) point to these limitations in their recent book, \nand come to a similar conclusion as this literature review: \nOnce seen as a great advantage to a group, allowing inspiration and mobilization \nof members for political action, identities are now viewed by many scholars as \nstraitjackets that distort and repress more than they help individuals. (p. 2)\nHow can the limitations of this theory of collective identity then explain why organizing \naround a shared sense of community built on collective identity is specifically absent \namong LGBT Czechs people? If we begin with an understanding that the theory \nexplained in this review emerges from predominately Western academics looking at \nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 6 9\nmovements that take place within the United States or Western Europe, answering this \nquestion begins with comparing the Western academic theory of collective identity to a \nnon-Western case study of movement mobilization.\nHistory of LGBT People in the Czech Republic\nThe LGBT movement in Prague is one example of a movement where deploying \ncollective identity in order to mobilize LGBT people appears ineffective, if not \ninappropriate. This case study of LGBT people and the LGBT movement in Prague thus \nbrings light to the way theoretical understandings of collective identity are dependent \non distinct relationship to civic life and experiences with individual and group identities. \nMoreover, it offers a critique of collective identity as a tool for mobilization by \ndemonstrating the way collective identity’s necessary framing and boundary work relies \non a Western conception of sexual identity that may be at odds with the national context \na non-Western movement might contend with. \nPositionality in Studying Across Difference\nOne of the central arguments of this paper is that understanding the experiences \nof Czech LGBT people requires an understanding of Czech history, specifically the \nhistory of LGBT people in the country. In pointing to the critical difference between \nthe Eastern and Western studies of sexuality, Kulpa and Mizielińska (2011) state, “The \nhistory of Western queer theory, significantly Stonewall and the ‘identitarian politics’ that \ncome from this watershed moment, have not shaped the experiences of LGBT people \nin the ‘East’ as it has the ‘West’” (p. 2). Hall (2009) also notes that while the majority \nof theory on sexual identities is extrapolated from “Western, largely urban, late modern \npopulations,” people who fall outside that group often “do not embrace same-sex \norientation or behavior as a primary of defining component of their social identity” and \n“do not form meaningful communities or political organizations above the level of sexual \nor friendship networks” (p. 55). \nStudying LGBT people throughout history poses a difficult challenge within itself, \nand I therefore draw on the Czech academics who are writing on these topics while \nalso drawing on queer theory to bring an appropriate methodology. This methodology \nrecognizes and works within the temporal nature of identity categories, the relationship \nbetween Western homosexual discourse and global understandings of non-heterosexual \nacts, and the significance of positionality in studying across difference. To do this I draw \nfrom the work of Grewal and Kaplan (1994), who call for a transnational feminism based \non comparison and connections rather than ahistorical relativism. They critique the idea \nof a transnational center and periphery that privileges the West as a hegemonic force \nand the other as a passive receptacle, arguing instead for a model of transnational cultural \nexchange that highlights a “multidirectional flow of culture” (p. 12, p. 8). Their feminist \ncritique accounts for the complex processes of globalization that bring about “scattered \nhegemonies,” in other words the intersection of power, agential nature, and cultural flow \nbetween the local and global that “thoroughly infiltrates the other” (11). \nFunk’s (2006) personal reflections on her experiences as a white American feminist \nworking with Czech women after the Velvet Revolution helps connect these queer \ntheoretical ideas to this specificity of the Czech case study. She similarly points to the \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n7 0 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nneed to address the power inequalities between the West and East that bore tension \naround feminism in the Czech Republic during this transition period. The problem \nof how to study across this power inequality and difference is an intrinsic part of my \nresearch, grounding me in a reflexive interpretation of Czech academics’ own navigation \nof their relationship with Western LGBT discourse.\nTransition After the Velvet Revolution\nGiven the limited documentation of LGBT life before the communist period, this his-\ntory of LGBT Czechs begins with the transitional period immediately following the Velvet \nRevolution (for more information on LGBT life during communism, see Lisková, 2013, \nProcházka, 1997, and Sokolová, 2014). While this focus is in part a limitation of the avail-\nable literature, this period of transition is especially relevant for the contemporary conditions \nof LGBT rights in the country. As Czech academic Sokolová (2004) states, “The contem-\nporary history of sexuality in the Czech Republic is very much shaped by the confrontation \nand contestation of the ideas, institutions and economic conditions of the socialist past and \nthe democratic present” (p. 263). \nThe Velvet Revolution was the period of transition out of communism, a result \nof massive student strikes and public demonstrations occurring when the Communist \nParty of Czechoslovakia was already politically isolated following the fall of the Berlin \nWall (David & Choi, 2005). It was also at this time that Czechoslovakia separated \ninto the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which came with a process of large-scale \nprivatization, the adoption of capitalism, and integration into the EU. Stulhofer and \nStanfort (2005) argue that because sexuality is linked to and influenced by religion, \nfamily, and societal institutions, as all these institutions were changed in the transitions, \nthe dynamics of sexuality were changed as well (p. 45). One instance of this change is \nthe decriminalization of homosexuality in 1961 (Procházka, 1997, p. 246). Through this \ndecriminalization, state-mandated acceptance of LGBT people in the Czech Republic \nwas pushed onto people as another importation of Western ideas rather than something \noriginating from among Czech people. Sokolová (2004) unpacks this popular Czech \nfeeling that homosexuality was not a “natural component” of Czech society and is a \nproduct of the transition into liberal democracy, “something ‘alien’ that does not concern \nthem personally” (p. 260). \nSexual Citizenship, Tolerance, and Civic Engagement in the Contemporary\nTouching on the Czech Republic’s joining of the European Union (EU) in 2004 \ncan help illuminate how the transition after communism was influenced by the West \nand the consequences of this influence on LGBT Czechs. Stychin’s (2001) work explains \nthe influence of the nation (through the concept of citizenship) on sexual identity and \nthe subsequent formation and goals of LGBT movements. In 2010, the Committee of \nMinisters of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation that EU member states \ncombat discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, a recommendation \nthat was signed by the Czech Republic (Prokopík, 2014). Stychin (2001) questioned how \nengagement with such international legal and political discourses can potentially disrupt \nlocal discourse on sexuality. \nThe Analysis of the Situation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Minority in the \nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 7 1\nCzech Republic (2007) is a documentation of the conditions of LGBT life in the Czech \nRepublic through primarily a legal perspective. One of the important takeaways from this \ndata is the way LGBT community is described: \nThere are many homosexuals who have very strong social ties within their mi-\nnority without desiring to present themselves to the majority as a member thereof \nor even take part in public life as such. […] The majority of the Czech LGBT \ncommunity falls into this very group, because public involvement of LGBT peo-\nple is still not the norm in our lands. (p. 10) \n \nThis description offers important context for the argument of Guay (2011) and Prokopík \n(2014), who both offer pointed critiques of Czech tolerance of LGBT people as assessed \nby the 2013 and 2014 Pew Research Center polls on global acceptance and belief about \nmorality of homosexuality. Guay’s (2011) criticism rests on a comparison of the Czech \nRepublic to Western countries: “There is a low level of organization among the gay and \nlesbian communities in the Czech Republic; the long-term work put into building a gay \nsociety similar to those flourishing in Western Europe, the United States, and Canada \njust isn’t there” (p. 111). Prokopík’s (2014) conference paper adds to this analysis with an \nassessment that LGBT Czechs legitimize this form of tolerance by not drawing attention \nto their problems. (See Fojtová and Sokolová (2014) for a historical perspective on this \nargument.) \nIdentity politics were coopted under state socialism, as well as abused by the Czech \nRepublic’s history of nationalist foreign occupiers (the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Nazi \nGermany, and the USSR) (McCajor, 2009, p. 53). After being forced to live under an \nideology that many at one time believed would bring the Czech Republic prosperity and \nequality there lingers a sense of skepticism towards aligning oneself with any ideology \n(Guay, 2011, p. 110). This can even manifest as a “general resentment against politicizing \none’s identity,” as Sokolová (2010) notes about Czech lesbian artists. Moreover, Flam \n(2001) asserts that Central European’s “constructions of reality are largely immune to \nnew social movements” (p. 171). She attributes this in part to less interest in identity \npolitics that might bring a sense of collective identity, and suggests there is a tension \nbetween mobilizing around identity-based social movements and a desire to maintain \ncurrently held identities, tradition, and the status quo. Howard (2003) further discusses \nthe weakness of civil society in CEE countries after communism, arguing that civic life \nis tense because of the extensive control of public identity during the communist period. \nPrivacy and independence are valued and preferred. These authors make the crucial \nconnections between the history of the Czech Republic, a contemporary aversion to civil \nengagement and community action, and the resulting stagnation in LGBT activism and \nrights. \nHistorical and Theoretical Incompatibilities with Collective Identity\nWhat underlies this historical account is the difference between Western LGBT \nsocial movements’ use of collective identity and the context in which LGBT Czechs face \ntheir current situation. Given this, should collective identity even be what Czech LGBT \npeople are aspiring towards? Jasper and McGarry’s (2015) argue that while collective \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n7 2 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nidentity is “‘fictional’ because of the complex cultural meanings it unavoidably elides,” \nit is a “necessary fiction […] because of the strategic advantages of identities” (p. 13). As \nseen in the previous section, within the social movement literature collective identity has \nbeen presented as key for mobilizing people in movements. Yet, these “complex cultural \nmeanings” seem to still rest within an assumption of shared perception of civic life and \nthe role of activism. Returning to queer theory, Joshua Gamson’s (1995) work critiques \nthe necessity of collective identity. He argues that identity politics falter when they are \ndeployed in movements that seek to destabilize identity, such as queer movements. He \npoints to how fixed identities are products of power. Both of their work alongside the \ndata presented in the next section encourage an imagination of what alternative forms of \norganizing, outside of relying on collective identity, might exist for the LGBT movement \nin Prague. \nThis section has presented an argument for the invaluableness of history in \nunderstanding contemporary Czech values regarding activism and civic life among LGBT \npeople. While the majority of the authors cited in this section are Czech or from the \nCEE region, this history has been bookmarked by Western queer theorists, leading back \nto what started this section: the difficult reality of studying across difference from within a \nWestern-dominated field. If nothing else, this is a testament to the reflexive and ongoing \npractice of de-centering assumptions and finding connections that must underlie this \ntype of research. Looking back to the argument presented by Hall and Read (2006) and \nSokolová (2014) presented in the introduction, one way to address this power differential \nis to work with the voices of Czech LGBT people themselves. \nData and Methods\nExtended interviews with twenty LGBT people living in Prague, Czech Republic \nare the foundation of this research. From February to July 2015, I connected with and \ninterviewed 20 respondents who identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual and were living in \nPrague (all respondent names have been changed to protect anonymity). Although three \nof the interview respondents also identified as trans women, this did not provide a large \nenough sample to speak on the specific experiences of trans people in Prague distinct \nfrom the more general LGBT movement. Further work on this topic should seek to \naddress the lack of work on Czech trans people.\nThe interview respondents were found through snowball sampling that began \nwith connections made through my study abroad program, LGBT organizations, and \nthe social media network of LGBT cafés. As LGBT people are an ‘invisible’ minority, \nit was necessary for people to self-identify, hence the choice of this sampling method. \nGiven that I speak very minimal Czech and could not secure a translator with my \nfunding, it was necessary to conduct the interviews in English. With one interviewee, \nthe use of a mobile electronic translator was used. This certainly limited my sample, \neliminating people who are less educated or older, as well as constraining the respondents’ \ndescriptions.\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 7 3\nTable 1.

Participation in none of these ways is \nrepresented as 0, while participation in all is represented as 7.\nBecause the findings from the interviews are limited in their applicability to \nLGBT people living in Prague and their relationship to a specifically LGBT movement, \npreviously collected data from the European Social Survey (ESS) is also analyzed. The \nESS data tests whether the interview findings could be generalized to participation in \nnon-LGBT movements, the non-LGBT population, and outside the specific context \nof Prague. Specifically, data on the Czech Republic from 2014 is used to compare \nmovement participation and values held by these survey respondents. For the former, \nmovement participation is measured through an activism participation index that sums \nrespondents’ participation in seven forms of activism as they reported over the last 12 \nmonths (see Table 1). There forms included boycotting certain products, contacting a \ngovernment official, working in a political party or action group, working in another \norganization or association, wearing or displaying a campaign badge/sticker, signing a \npetition, or taking part in a lawful public demonstration. For the latter, the ESS includes \na module for measuring human values, developed by Schwartz (1992). He designed this \nseries of questions to measure 10 traits, of which three were chosen for their potential to \nreflect the values related to participation, as described by respondents in the interviews: \nconformity, traditionalism and universalism. \nSince the ESS data does not accurately capture the percentage of respondents who \nare LGBT, with the only measure being ‘belonging to a group discriminated based on \nsexuality’ which makes up less than 1% of the sample, this data can be assumed to not \ncapture LGBT people in particular (see Table 1). Comparing the findings from interviews \nwith the 2014 ESS data on the Czech Republic thus allows for generalizing the argument \noutside the LGBT movement, LGBT people, and the city of Prague. Yet, in order to \nfully make the argument that the relationship between limited movement participation \nand the influence of values that are products of national history, comparison between the \nCzech Republic and other CEE countries is made. Other CCE countries were chosen \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n7 4 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nin order to compare countries that had similar recent national experiences to the Czech \nRepublic, in other words were former members of the Soviet Bloc, but also had different \nhistories prior. The countries chosen were thus Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary. \nLGBT Czech Experiences of Collective Identity and Activism in Prague\nFirst drawing from the interviews conducted with LGBT people living in Prague, I \nargue that collective identity does not exist among LGBT Czechs. Then, incorporating \nthe results from the ESS data, I delve into the conditional tolerance of the general \nCzech population towards LGBT people, how different LGBT Czechs perceive the \ncontemporary situation in Prague, and the way these both are informed by perceptions \nof activism and the LGBT movement in particular. Following that, I argue both that the \nbasis of these perceptions and relationships can be best understood through the valuation \nof private over public life, and that these values are products of Czech national history. \nLastly, I turn to participation in activism within the Czech Republic at large, as well as \nwithin various other CEE countries (Germany, Hungary and Slovakia), to show how this \nrelationship between national history and movement participation might extend beyond \nthe LGBT movement in Prague. \nQuestioning the Existence of an LGBT Community\nWhen asked whether there was a LGBT community in Prague, the idea of \ncommunity seemed elusive and inappropriate to many respondents. Although some did \nidentify a form of LGBT community, none described what is understood as collective \nidentity nor did they see it functioning as a mobilizing tool. This disinterest towards \na community based around being LGBT was shared across respondents, regardless \nof participation in LGBT movement organizations. Respondents specifically did not \nrecognize a LGBT community that revolved around a collective LGBT identity and \noften talked about community in conjunction with activism. This is why, even as the \nterm community is used in the interview guide and thus in the conversations with \nrespondents, I analyze their perception of community through the sociological concept of \ncollective identity as it relates to movement participation.\nDavid, a 24-year-old bisexual man, didn’t think there was an LGBT community in \nPrague nor a reason to have one: \n…to be honest I’m not even sure it’s good to build some like strongly intercon-\nnected community around sexual orientation as a base. I’m not really convinced \nit’s a good reason, it’s like building a community of people with blue eyes. It’s \nsomething biological. I mean it sounds a bit confused because I’m actually a \nmember of a group that’s trying to build something like this. Well, I’m trying to \nfind friends who have something in common with me, that doesn’t mean I have \na general feeling of community with hundreds or thousands of gay people in this \ncountry.\nHe doesn’t see sexual orientation as a meaningful basis for group identity, even as he \nhimself is involved in a student-based LGBT organization. Lukáš, a 34-year-old gay man \ninvolved in the leadership of an LGBT organization, similarly thought that movements \nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 7 5\nshould be based around issues rather than identities: “Yeah, so there are very different \norganizations, and I think by focusing on one or two things it is much easier that you \ncover the topic to more deep, to more depth, than if you are just uniting gay people just \nbecause they are gay.” Petra, a 27-year-old lesbian woman had a similar perspective, even \nas she was not involved in any LGBT organizations. She preferred to be in a group with \npeople who had the same hobbies rather than the same sexual orientation. \nAnother reason respondents disliked the idea of a LGBT community was because of \ntheir perception of the political nature of such a group. Petra saw danger in being a part \nof any form of group identity: \nI don’t have a need to be in community and say I’m a part of LGBT community, \nlet’s do something together. And it’s horrible because what I really don’t like is \nto be part of some big group […]. I just don’t want to be a part of some group, \nwhere we share only one opinion but the rest is absolutely different.\nThe influence of Czech history in apparent here, as living under oppressive ideologies \nhas encouraged a skepticism towards aligning oneself with any ideology and a general \ndistancing from politicizing identity (Guay, 2011; Sokolová, 2010). For Štefan, a 29-year-\nold gay man originally from Slovakia, even the language of using LGBT “boxed” him \nin: “I don’t like these boxes, I actually a little bit hate the shortcut LGBT. It just brings \nsomething with it that I don’t consider myself to be part of.” This general sense of \ndiscomfort with being a member of a large politicized group of people is also reflects in \nhow Pavel, a 40-year-old gay man, noted that there are not many communities in Prague \nin general. This is consistent with the lack of religious communities, given the large \nmajority of atheist people in Prague, as well as the predominant uniformity of Czech \nethnicity across the country. \nConditional Tolerance and the General Population’s Perception of LGBT People\nWhile most respondents did not view themselves as part of a collective identity, \ntheir understanding of the general Czech population’s view of LGBT people is less \nheterogeneous. Petra noted that the general Czech view of LGBT people is often \nmarked by public displays of promiscuity and assumptions about LGBT people leading \nabnormal lifestyles. Given this popular perception, she thought LGBT people needed \nmore opportunities to be visible in non-sexual situations to help people see them as \n“normal”. On the other hand, as Pavel noted, LGBT activism on the whole is perceived \nby non-LGBT people as “calling for special treatment,” and as he noted, “nobody gets \nspecial treatment in the Czech Republic.” Special treatment isn’t permissible because, as \nDavid explained, there is a “huge built in social sense of equality” that “gives this sense \nof uniformity and that everybody should be the same.” Therefore trying to seem more \n“normal” would be incompatible with participating in LGBT activism. \nNearly all respondents expressed that they experienced very little discrimination, \nin spite of these perceptions of LGBT people. In national surveys, Czechs report a high \nlevel of tolerance towards LGBT people (see the 2013 and 2014 polls conducted by \nPew Research Center). Many respondents agreed that Czechs are tolerant, but they also \ndistinguished tolerance from respect. As Martin, a 21-year-old gay man, said: \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n7 6 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nMy attitude towards tolerance is that we tolerate smoking and alcohol drinking, \nwe tolerate prostitution, we tolerate drug abuse, but homosexuality isn’t bad, \nhomosexuality don’t cause problems. So the Czechs don’t should to tolerate ho-\nmosexuality, they should to respect homosexuality.\nJaroslav, a 39-year-old gay men, further discussed the dynamic between this purported \ntolerance and the reality of non-LGBT Czechs’ attitudes:\nJaroslav: Because Czech society looks very tolerant, but it’s not true. Because if \nsomebody—because in every research most people tell, I don’t care about gays \nand lesbians, I don’t care, I support them, blah blah blah. But then if somebody \nhas gay or lesbian neighbors, the situation changes a lot and they are very angry \nwith this.\nI refer to this phenomenon as conditional tolerance, where non-LGBT people tolerate \nLGBT people until it begins to affect their lives by being too visible or public.\nIndifference is one source of this conditional tolerance among Czech people, as \nDavid explained that “most Czech people they have this attitude that they just don’t \ncare about what other people do in their personal life. Like Czech people tend to be \nvery indifferent to other people, like there’s very low community feeling generally.” He \nwent on to say that Czechs are usually focused on their close family and friends and are \n“indifferent” to strangers. This indifference is thus directly connected to a sense of each \nperson prioritizing their own issues and their friends over public issues, to the notable \nextent that they do not care what other people do. Lenka, 26-year-old lesbian woman, \nalso understood conditional tolerance in relationship to this prioritization of the individual \namong Czechs when she said, “I think they ignore [LGBT people]. I think it’s okay if it’s \nnot in my family, not in my school, not in my work.” She points out that non-LGBT \npeople do not care what others do as long as it does not affect their personal circle. Pavel \nalso discussed how this kind of conditional tolerance is in reaction to Czech history: \nCzech tolerance is usually that you don’t care, don’t care about what your neigh-\nbor is doing, now that we live in a free society you don’t need to spy on him, you \ndon’t need to say to the state police how many children they have, how many \ntimes they are using the shower—things like this were really recorded during \ncommunism, everything was recorded. […] So now it means just live and let live. \nBut in the same way, why to grant any special rights? Why to change anything? \nWe can be free as it is.\nDifferent Perceptions of Contemporary Situation Among LGBT People\nAlthough many respondents described the general Czech population as being \nconditionally tolerant towards LGBT Czechs to some extent, their response to this \nsituation differed. This included different perceptions on whether addressing LGBT \npeople’s unequal rights was necessary at all. When Zuzana described her experience \nworking for one LGBT organization, Prague Pride, she noted the backlash the \nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 7 7\norganization had received from some LGBT people who are content with the current \nsituation. Ondřej, a 21-year-old gay man, did not participate in the organizing around \nPrague Pride, but he did attend their annual Pride festival which he described as a \n“carnival.” However, he recognized that other LGBT Czechs had a different attitude \ntowards the festival, as “something they don’t want to see.” Many other respondents \nnoted that Prague Pride was a contentious event among LGBT people as well, mostly \nbecause of the way it contributed to the general population’s association between LGBT \npeople and explicit public sexuality. Štefan was one of the respondents who didn’t see \nthis kind of activism as a solution to LGBT people’s situation in the Czech Republic \nbecause to him it conflicted with LGBT people being perceived as ‘normal.’\nSome LGBT people are satisfied by the kind of conditional tolerance that exists in \nPrague. Jakub, a 26-year-old gay man, did not have any interest in doing activist work \nbecause, as he said, “I think now it’s not necessary in Prague. […] There are no needs \nto do this.” Violent discrimination against LGBT people is quite low in the Czech \nRepublic, as is reported by both respondents and in the Analysis of the Situation (2007). \nMany LGBT people in the Czech Republic are able to live their lives as they wish, \nif they do not want to be married or have children. As Lenka observed, “Maybe they \nhaven’t had need for equal rights because they are fine like they are. Maybe they don’t \nwant a child or wedding or something.” Some respondents certainly felt like they were \ncomfortable with their current lives, and thus did not see the need to do anything to \nchange it.\nEngagement with Activism and Perceived Roles of an LGBT Movement\nMany of the respondents who felt uncomfortable with their current lives \nparticipated in an LGBT organization. Jaroslav, for example, was one of the respondents \nmost explicitly unhappy with the differences between LGBT people’s rights and non-\nLGBT people’s rights. This dissatisfaction was channeled into leadership of a major LGBT \norganization in Prague. Yet, as elaborated in the beginning of this section, the majority \nof respondents who participated in LGBT organizations did so because of a problem \nthey saw facing LGBT people, not because of a sense of collective identity. David best \narticulated this common perception that participating in activism had nothing to do with \na sense of collective identity:\nThat doesn’t mean that with everyone that’s a part of the movement and if there’s \nlike tens of thousands of people in that protest, that doesn’t mean that I feel like \nI’m a member of that community and personally connected to all of them, defi-\nnitely not. Not because we have the same cause or because we’re all LGBT, no. \nSorry but that’s just not enough, that doesn’t seem right.\nDavid did not see a collective identity forming in the LGBT movement, neither in \nmobilizing people to join or something that manifested through one’s participation. \nBecause not all LGBT people perceive their situation in Prague as negative, \nmany feel comfortable not taking action. This leads to a shortage of volunteers in \nLGBT organizations, as respondents who were leaders in such organizations noted. For \nexample, when talking about his work at an LGBT organization, Lukáš explained that \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n7 8 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nthe two big challenges he faced were finding money and the lack of “man-power.” \nRespondents’ accounts of low mobilization are also reflective of movement participation \nin the Czech Republic at large. Over 50% of Czech survey respondents in the ESS \nparticipated in no forms of activism within the last 12 months, 33% participated in at \nleast one form, and none participated in all the forms listed in the index (see Table 1 for \nmore on Activism Participation Index). Similarly, 45% of the 20 interview respondents \nwere active participants in an LGBT organization, and 55% were not. Among the \ninterview respondents, the difference in participation often came down to not only how \ncomfortable people were with the current situation, but also different perceptions about \nthe use of activism.\nAll respondents thought there were some issues that LGBT people faced, but \nthey varied on the necessity of taking action on them. Some respondents who were \nnot interested in activism thought that the LGBT situation would continue to move \nin a positive direction even if no action from activists is taken. Varya noted the EU’s \ninfluence in her reasoning for this: “But even without help it goes that direction you \nknow, it’s part of the European Union, more and more countries legalized [gay marriage] \nright now.” Respondents who did not participate in activism, often said that it was not \nthe right time, even if they recognized legal or social issues facing themselves or other \nCzech LGBT people. As Jakub stated, “I think that gay couples should have the right to \nadopt children, but I think the right time for this will come in five or ten years.” \nPavel saw these various forms of putting a hold on activism until it is “the right \ntime” in a very negative way. In his estimation, some LGBT people want to wait on \ntaking action because they do not want to provoke or disrupt or in other words take \nthe risks of participating in activism, given that they can live with little discomfort in the \ncurrent situation. He also perceived some LGBT people’s decision not to participate as \ncoming from a skepticism towards activism in general:\nHere, there’s again this mistrust and you really have to convince people that what \nyou are doing is really going to help them or will really change something, it’s \nnot going to make it only worse, that it has really—there is a point in doing it.\nActivism is perceived as potentially making things worse because of the connection \nmade between the ideology of activism and the heavy control of life Czechs have seen \nthroughout their history. As Ondřej similarly said, “I think that’s the biggest trait of \nCzechs, is being skeptical, like I think every time something new comes, Czech people \njust see the bad things first.” Seeing the potential for “bad things first” is a logical way of \nthinking in a nation whose history that has often put it’s people in a position of deference \nto ideological power. \nValuation of Private Life Over Public Life\nThe proceeding sub-sections have all touched on or alluded to this central \nargument, what I find to be the grounding motivation for these various dynamics around \nparticipation in LGBT activism: the normative prioritization of private life in Czech \nsociety. Respondents consistently discussed forthright or described in themselves the \nvaluation of private lives (including close friends, family, and personal freedom) over \nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 7 9\nparticipation in public life (including politics, activism, and the freedoms of an abstract \ncollective). They connected this value with conditional tolerance, participation in \nactivism, and, most significantly, the influence of Czech history on contemporary life in \nPrague. Martin was one respondent who connected the conditional tolerance towards \nLGBT people with the prioritization of private lives:\n[Non-LGBT people] don’t fight against [LGBT rights], but don’t support them. \n[…] I think that in Czech nature is looking after about myself only. The Czechs \nare relaxed people, they are glad to looking after about themselves but not other \npeople. […] The Czechs are interested in their own problems. The Czechs are \ninterested in high taxes, low living conditions of them, but don’t interested in \nproblems of other people especially minorities.\nHe pointed to how non-LGBT Czechs’ conditional tolerance of LGBT Czechs is in \npart due to the prioritization of the problems that affect their more personal lives. This \nleads them to both not care about LGBT Czechs and not support their issues. Šárka, a \n35 year old lesbian woman, also made the connection between the valuation of private \nover public life and LGBT respondents’ attitude and involvement in activism. She linked \npeople’s lack of public and civic engagement with their prioritization of their “inner \ncircle,” in other words their private lives. Jiří further speculated that Czech history \ninfluenced this valuation of private life:\nMaybe it’s because of the experience of communism which was very centered… \nFor communism it was good collective or to do things collectively, and it was \nthe point of it, the source of power of communism was the collectivity. And now \npeople wanted in 90s to distance from it because they view it as bad or oppressive \nregime. So maybe more people want to live their lives in more individual way. \nDuring the communist period, Czech citizens were forced to participate in public parades \nand demonstrations of support for the communist party. There was a lack of trust as \nstrangers, neighbors, coworkers, even friends would rat one another out. After the Velvet \nRevolution, individual freedom and privacy became important on a national scale. I \nargue that this sentiment is still held by Czechs as a value in which private life is priority \nover public life. \nCzech history has informed the shape of Prague’s contemporary LGBT movement \nparticipation. Respondents connected the prioritization of private life over public, \nthe shape of conditional tolerance, and the incompatibility of collective identity seen \nthroughout their interviews. Historical experiences on the national level informed the \nvalues regarding civic life, and in turn private life. These values then help to shape other \nvalues, such as those held about tolerating minority groups, the role of activism, and \ndesire for group identity. Ultimately, all of these values inform the decision of whether to \nparticipate in movement activism or not. \nParticipation in Czech Society at Large\nRespondents’ firsthand accounts of the dynamics surrounding participation in \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n8 0 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nLGBT activism present an interconnected web of values and national history. Yet by \nthe nature of these interviews, this data is limited to activism around LGBT issues as \nspecifically experienced by LGBT people in Prague. As seen in the theoretical section, \nLGBT identity and movement have had a particular history that is distinct from other \nidentity movements, let alone movements not organized around identity. Moreover, \nthe experiences of these particular Czech LGBT people might differ from those who do \nnot live in Prague. To see to what extent these findings are indeed specific to LGBT \npeople in Prague, data collected throughout the Czech Republic via the ESS is used as a \ncomparison to the interview findings. \nTable 2 shows models for the three values used in the ESS’s human values measures \nthat I identified as similar to the values referenced in the interview findings. These \nthree values are conformity, traditionalism, and universalism, and were chosen to reflect \npotential values instilled by Czech national history. Conformity mirrors the attractiveness \nof normalcy referenced positively and negatively by various respondents in a negative \nrelationship with movement participation. Traditionalism mirrors the acceptance of the \ncurrent situation (both legal and social) discussed positively and negatively by various \nrespondents in a negative relationship with participation. Universalism mirrors the \ndissatisfaction with conditional tolerance and different rights for LGBT people discussed \nby some respondents in a positive relationship with participation. In the data, I would \nthus expect to see conformity and traditionalism as having a negative relationship with \nmovement participation, and universalism having a positive one.\nThe first model run in Table 2 establishes that the demographic variables used as \ncontrols account for some differences in participation among Czechs. Working from a \nWestern knowledge of social movements, it was expected that higher education, being \nmale, and higher household income would positively impact movement participation, as \nis shown in the first Control model. Looking next at the influence of each of the three \nvalues on movement participation among Czechs, those who held universalist values were \nsignificantly more likely to participate in movement activities, whereas traditionalism and \nconformity had no affect in their individual models. In the All model, these affects hold, \nand universalism is the only value that has an affect on movement participation, in a \npositive direction.\nTable 2.

This mirrors what \nwas found in the interviews, that respondents who were dissatisfied with conditional \ntolerance and different rights for LGBT people were more likely to participate than those \nwho did not. Movement participants holding universalist beliefs also could potentially be \nexplained by a valuation of more than one’s inner-circle, or in other words valuing public \nlife more than private life. This could further back-up the finding from the interviews \nthat a lack of mobilization through collective identity was due to the more generally held \nvaluation of private life over public life.\nWhat requires more explanation is why there was no relationship between valuing \nconformity or traditionalism and participating in movements. One possible reason \nconformity has no affect on movement participation is the general belief in egalitarianism \nheld by Czechs, as described by respondents. If belief in equality isn’t controversial, than \nmovement participation might not be seen as non-conforming and in fact within the \nrealm of norms. If devaluing traditionalism had a significant impact on participation, it \nwould have suggested that movement participation is a product of reactionary behavior. \nBut the significance of valuing universalism suggests that movement participation is, \nin part, a product of altruism. Given the interview respondents’ perception that Czech \npeople value private life over public life, the desire to help those outside their private \nsphere might be less common and in turn, lead to less participation. While the specific \nvalues brought up in the context of the LGBT movement were not mirrored in the \nlarger Czech sample, values are still shown to influence movement participation.\nComparison to Other CEE Countries\nIn arguing that history has shaped contemporary Czech participation in movements, \nmuch of what I discuss in terms of national history is about the Czech communist regime \nfrom 1948 to 1989. Yet, it is clear from differences across the CEE region that national \nhistories cannot be boiled down to past membership in the Soviet Bloc. As Varya noted, \nthe contemporary movement conditions within various former Soviet bloc countries vary \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n8 2 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\ngreatly. To see the degree to which the trends in Table 2 are symptomatic of post-commu-\nnist transition, the Czech case can be compared to countries in the CEE region that have \nsimilarly transitioned from a communist system in the last 50 years. Hungary, Slovakia, and \nGermany serve as the comparisons in Table 3, which repeats the ‘All’ model from Table 2 \nfor each country. The influence of valuing conformity, traditionalism and universalism on \nparticipation is notably different across these four countries. While universalism was the only \nvalue of significance for Czech participation, in Hungary both universalism and conformity \nhad significant influence, in Slovakia only conformity was significant, and in Germany all \nthree values were significant.\nWhile East Germany was run by a communist state, after its fall the Eastern faction \nwas reintegrated into West Germany, which had no such communist history and is \nregarded as more a part of Western than Eastern Europe. Thus, all three values being \nsignificant in Germany confirms the expectation that the assumptions drawn from social \nmovement mobilization theory is particular to Western European countries and their \nhistorical influences. Looking then to the countries with more similar relationships to \nthe Soviet Union, the findings on Hungary are similar to the Czech Republic, while \nSlovakia tells a rather different story. This might be due to both the Czech Republic and \nHungary recognizing same-sex partnerships on a national level, whereas Slovakia does \nnot (Prokopík, 2014). However, this should not be seen as an equation of the situation \nfor LGBT people in the Czech Republic and Hungary, given that the role of the right \nwing media and its hateful speech plays a much larger role in the latter. These groups in \nHungary are fueled by a “nationalist, anti-Western discourse,” calling LGBT movement \nsupporters “national corrupting” and the cause of “moral decay” (Riszovannij, 2001, p. \n158).\nThe Catholic Church also plays a large role in both Hungary and Slovakia, whereas \nthe vast majority of Czechs identify as atheist or with no religious affiliation. Lucie \nremarked on the effect of religion in these countries after communism: “[In the Czech \nRepublic] there isn’t so much influence of the Catholic Church. When you compare \nwith Slovakia or Poland, they are way more religious, and it shows.” In combination \nwith the findings on Slovakia, this suggests that the degree to which conformity is \nrelevant for movement participation reflects the degree that participating in activism is \nseen as intrinsically working against a country’s cultural norms. \nOverall, the findings in Table 3 support the argument made via the interview \nfindings that there is a relationship between particular national histories and the values \nheld in those countries because the latter influences movement participation. Although all \nfour of the countries experienced a communist regime in the last 50 years, they each had \ndifferent responses to this period in their history, which gave rise to different values that \nhave impacted movement participation in the countries differently. This shows that the \nspecific connections found in the interviews between history and contemporary values are \nnot only about the influence of the recent communist regime but also about something \nunique to the Czech nation in how it responded to that period. \nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 8 3\nTable 3.

Although collective identity appears frequently in discussions of \nmobilization, its application as a potential movement strategy must be checked against a \nmovement’s national and historical context. From interviews with twenty LGBT people \nliving in Prague, it is evident that there are normative values, informed by national \nhistory, that determine whether people participate in a social movement. The link \nbetween these values and national history is noteworthy in the way it disrupts the logic \nof collective identity as a mobilizing tool. A sense of collective identity was not present \namong any respondents, regardless if they participated or not in activism, because the idea \nof a collective identity conflicted with the values held to a greater or lesser extent by each \nrespondent. The most relevant of these values was prioritizing private life over public life, \nwhich is deeply influenced by national history and its accompanying understanding of \npersonal freedom and equality. \nOverall, the findings from both the interviews and ESS data analysis support the \nNation and History in Collective Identity Among LGBT Czechs\n8 4 Cleo M. Spencer Pomona College\nargument that nationally held values impact how people come to participate in activism \nand the tools that will be most available to them for mobilizing others. The interview \ndata speaks to the way applying a Western model of collective identity for mobilization is \nlimited because of the role national values take in shaping attitudes towards participation. \nThe quantitative data backs up this connection between values and participation and \nfurther builds on how the relationship between the two differs across nations with \ndifferent historical and contemporary realities.\nUltimately, this is thus not an argument about the intangible idea of post-\ncommunism, but rather about the distinct positionality of national history that influences \nhow those nation’s people come to engage with changing their world. As Hall and Read \n(2006) offer, “whether we retain the term ‘post-socialism’ or not, the broader challenge is \nto understand the increasingly diverse incorporation of the socialist past into present social \nactualities and experiences” (p. 12). The central work of this research is to elaborate on \nthese incorporations in the Czech Republic as it has affected the mobilization of LGBT \nactivism. And if collective identity does not work as a tool for mobilization among LGBT \nCzechs, what should LGBT organizations in Prague look to in trying to address the lack \nof mobilization? \nMany respondents argued that if the situation of LGBT people in Prague was to \nchange, the general heterosexual population would need to be exposed to more LGBT \npeople so that they might come to understand them as “normal.” Martin, a 21 year old \ngay man said, said being visible was important because “I want to people know that we \nare normal people. Normal people who study and pay taxes, somebody have children \nand living among them.” While much of the LGBT movement in Prague today revolves \naround legal recognition and the rights that go with it, perhaps greater attention and \neffort towards breaking down an essential construction of LGBT identity would be \nvaluable. This move could take inspiration from the Czech lesbian activists working \non issues of parental rights, who are already modeling activism beyond essentialism and \nassimilation, towards the deployment of an “intersectional critique of normative sexuality \nand gender” (Fojtová, 2011, p. 357). Mobilization is fundamentally a matter of working \nwith the expressed needs, values, and identities of a movement’s potential participants, \nand many LGBT organizations in Prague are already trying to accommodate these \ncomplex intersections of values, identity, and history. It is my hope that this research will \noffer new jumping-off points for these organizations in Prague to further develop such \nmobilization strategies that work outside the limitations of a collective LGBT identity. \nFor future work on this topic, there is much left unexplored regarding the influence \nof gender on LGBT experience and movement participation. Because of the gendered \nhierarchies that proliferate among LGBT people as well, there are few accounts of the \nintersection between gender and LGBT identity in the Czech Republic. Several women \nrespondents spoke of this in their interviews, such as Šárka, who noted, “There might be \nless equality in female to male than in gay. [...] some how the sexism seems more present \nthan homophobia.” The feminist movement in the Czech Republic has experienced \nmuch greater resistance than the LGBT movement, and lesbian women have had unique \ndifficulty creating spaces for themselves (for work on Czech feminism see Saxonberg \n2001, Pachmanová 2010, Kapusta-Pofahl 2002; for work on Czech lesbian women in \nactivism see Sokolová 2010, Fojtová 2011). \nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/urceu/vol2016/iss1/7\nClaremont–UC Undergraduate Research Conference on the European Union 8 5\nAuthor’s Notes And Acknowledgments\nI’d like to thank my thesis advisor, Professor Colin Beck, for his patience and en-\ncouragement throughout this project.

    "abstract": "Social movement theories are often built on Western and US-centric understandings of civic life and the values that underpin it. Studying participation in the LGBT movement in Prague, Czech Republic provides one context for complicating such underlying assumptions. Within theory on mobilization, collective identity is said to act as a conduit for developing personal investment through individuals’ identities. Interviews with LGBT people in Prague, however, show that there is little sense of or desire for collective identity among these potential participants. Czech national history contextualizes respondents’ distinct descriptions of the role of civic life and activism, value of private life, and contemporary situation for LGBT people in Prague. Drawing from these descriptions, and an analysis of the influence of values on movement participation in the Czech Republic and other CEE countries, I argue that nation and history complicate the application of collective identity for mobilization in Prague’s LGBT movement",
