TheCivil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, made it illegal to discriminate againstemployees regarding race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, but at that pointin time, the phrase \"sexual harassment” had no meaning. Although women wereaware of their daily struggles with gender discrimination in the workplace, no onehad coined the phrase, and this pervasive problem was not yet an established partof the legal system.In the 1970s, the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace came to theattention of the public and the government via media and the feminist movement.During the early part of this decade, feminists defined sexual harassment as \"anexpression of power and a form of sex discrimination” (Bingham, 1994, p. 3).Studies focused on sexual harassment as being rooted in male dominance andprivilege in the workplace. According to Bingham (1994), this definitioncontinued to evolve throughout the decade to include such diversities as race,ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation among women.i2During the 1980s, the literature on sexual harassment increased, andscholars across disciplines attempted to define sexual harassment in a moreconcrete, objective manner (Madden, 1987; Tangri, Burt, & Johnson, 1982;Terpestra & Cook, 1985; U. S. Merit Systems Protection Board, 1981). Otherresearchers explored the effects on victims, and the number of incidents that tookplace (Fitzgerald, Shullman, Bailey, Richards, Swecker, Gold, Ormerod, &Weitzman, 1988; Powell, 1986). Still, this problem was relatively new to thepublic in general, and to the legal system. For example, Kreps (1993) noted, “ItVinson that workers were granted legal protection against sexual harassment as aform of sexual discrimination” (p. 149).In the early 1990s, the subject of sexual harassment “burst into the homesof millions of people who watched the much publicized Clarence Thomas/AnitaHill hearings” (Jaschik-Herman & Fisk, 1995, p. 440). After the hearings, therewas a reported 50% increase in sexual harassment charges filed from the yearbefore (Abramson, 1992). Certainly, this could be due to an increase in theviolations of sexual harassment, but it is possible that as women and men becamemore aware of what characterized and defined sexual harassing behavior, morereports followed.Throughout the past three decades, the public has come to more fullyunderstand the problem of sexual harassment. Organizations have increasinglysought communication training to help eliminate the problem, to educate their=was not until 1986 with the Supreme Court’s decision in Meritor Savings Bank v2employees, and learn how to better manage sexual harassment situations amongpersonnel (Bingham, 1991).RationaleDespite the growing awareness, how a source's behaviors are interpretedand evaluated by a receiver in sexual harassment situations remains unclear.Understanding a receiver's perceptual process is an important step in studyingsexual harassment because a receiver's response or reaction to a source's behaviorsis heavily dependent on how those behaviors are interpreted and evaluated in agiven context by the receiver (Burgoon & Hale, 1988; Teven, Martin, &Neupauer, 1998). For example, if a manager enters his assistant's office, andproceeds to tell her a sexually-explicit joke, she could interpret his behaviorpositively, evaluating the communication as an attempt to lighten the mood in theoffice, or as an expression of how comfortable he is with their relationship.Accordingly, her response to the message might be to laugh, or to share an equallyhumorous joke with him. However, if she interprets his message negatively,perceiving the message to be a personal insult against her, or perhaps a hostileattempt at intimidation, then her response might be to ask him to refrain from suchhumor, or perhaps to report the incident to his superior. As researchers explorereceiver's perceptions, better insights will be obtained as to what responses andreactions will result, and even how attitudes about the relationships are influenced.4Secondly, although research on this topic is increasing, investigations haveonly recently begun to explore this phenomenon in the field of communicationI(Bingham, 1991; Kreps, 1993). There is a void in the literature regardingreceivers’ perceptions of sources’ communicative behaviors, and as suggestedpreviously, the implications of such research are critical enough to merit moreextensive research.It is important to note here that in sexual harassment situations, a receiver'sperceptions are largely influenced by a source's verbal messages, (in particular,messages which are designed to hurt, intimidate or insult the receiver), and asource's use of distance/space. When individuals use verbally aggressivemessages in their communications with others, they are helping to create a hostileenvironment. The literature suggests that verbal aggressiveness is designed to hurtthe receiver (Infante & Wigley III, 1986). In sexual harassment situations, thisintent to hurt can be demonstrated by insults (Bingham, 1994), and even threats(Greenberg, 1976). This is true of interpersonal relationships, family interactions,and school or work environments (Bingham, 1994; Infante & Wigley III, 1986;Kreps, 1993; Teven, Martin, & Neupauer, 1998).Not only do sources' verbally aggressive messages influence receivers'perceptions, but the use of proxemic violations do as well. Research indicates thatpeople often use proximity, or distance, to communicate intentions (Burgoon &Hale, 1988; Leathers, 1997; Littlejohn, 1999; Manusov, 1990). And in situationswhere a receiver's normal expectations of distance are violated, receivers can■5interpret this behavior as being intentional. Thus, a perceiver's resultingperceptions are influenced by this emotionally arousing, nonverbal behavior.Finally, the utility of this area of research is evident when one considers theimportance of communication training with regard to the appropriate responses tosexual harassment. As more communication researchers attempt to clarify andunderstand receivers' varying perceptions regarding sexually harassing behaviors,Thus, more effective communication training can be offered to organizations.Sexual harassment has been studied in relation to power, gender,compliance-gaining techniques, relationship and status variables, and nonverbalcommunication behaviors, (Andrews, 1987;'Harvey, 1987; Heider, 1958; Horgan& Reeder, 1986; Shaver, 1985), and most research has focused on sources’perceptions of receivers’ blameworthiness (Edmonds & Cahoon, 1986; Jensen &Gutek, 1982; Johnson & Workman, 1994; Mathes & Kempher, 1976; Mazelan,1980; Richards, Rollerson & Phillips, 1991; Workman & Johnson, 1991).However, for the reasons previously mentioned, this investigation is concernedwith receivers' perceptions of source blameworthiness.Attributions of intent, then responsibility, and ultimately blameworthinessplay crucial roles in people's everyday social interactions (Shaver, 1985) becauseof everyday differences and conflicts. The Bureau ofLabor Statistics projects thatthe labor force will reach 139 million people by the year 2000 (Hudson Institute,1987). It follows, that as more people enter the workplace, so enters moreiIIa better grasp of contributing factors, which perpetuate this problem, will develop.6diversity among the workers. And often, because of the lack of communicationtraining combined with such diversity of employees, businesses will see greaternumbers of conflicts arising among personnel. When conflicts ensue, people oftenask who caused the conflict, and who should be blamed.Shaver (1985) contends that blameworthiness is a key element to considerwhen assessing causality, and after establishing intent and responsibility. Insexual harassment situations, a perceiver's negative evaluations and interpretationsof a source's behavior, lead to perceptions of intent and responsibility. Theseperceptions, in turn, lead to attributions of blame. Ultimately, the amount ofblameworthiness that a perceiver attributes to the source, will affect his or herresponse/reaction to the encounter, and his or her attitude about the relationship.This study seeks to explore and ultimately test the relationship betweenreceivers’ attributions of sources’ blameworthiness, and two variables: (1) verballyaggressive messages, and (2) proxemic violations. In order to examine this aspectadequately, this report first delineates the theoretical framework involved inconceptualizing attributions of sources’ blameworthiness. Second, perceptions ofverbally aggressive messages and proxemic violations are discussed, and anexplanation of the expected relationships among these variables and attributions ofblameworthiness is suggested. Finally, the research design, how data wasgathered, the analyses, and the results are explained. To begin this investigation,attribution theory is discussed.7Attribution TheoryAccording to Heider (1958), the human mind seeks sufficient reasons orexplanations for the behavior of others. People do this to make possible a more orless stable, predictable, and controllable world. Bradac, Hosman, and Tardy(1978) studied the consequences on attribution of linguistic intensity and levels ofintimacy in reciprocating messages of self-disclosure. Sillars (1980) explored theorder and distribution of communicative acts in discussions.More recent research includes Reardon’s (1991) essay. In it she stated that“attribution theory suggests that people seek reasons or justifications for theactions of others and their own actions in order to understand certainconsequence” (p. 18). Other relevant research includes Johnson and Workman’s(1994) study. These researchers noted that attribution theory provides a basis forinvestigating how victims of sexual harassment are perceived. Johnson andWorkman (1994) suggested that “people are information processors who searchfor facts to explain what is happening or has happened” (p. 384).This study, however, is interested in testing the relationship betweensources' communicative behaviors and receivers' perceptions of the sources'blameworthiness for those behaviors. Attribution theory serves as an appropriateframework to study this phenomenon.Frandsen and Clement (1984) note that attribution theorists seek to clarifyhow diverse types of data are used by sources. Further, one of the most effectiveand usefill delineations of these data, suggested by Jones and Nisbett (1972),8describe three types of data, (historical, effect, and cause), that sources andreceivers use in their attribution processes.Concerning attribution theory, one of the most important distinctions to bemade is whether the perceiver views the cause of the behavior to be explained asinternal/personal or external/impersonal to the actor. Applied to an incident ofsexual harassment, this means whether the actor himselfTherself is perceived as thecause of the harassment, {internal'), or just as part of an uncontrollable situation.{external) (Rotter, 1966). The \"uncontrollable situation\" that Rotter (1966) refersto here, concerns the situational data used by perceivers in their externalattributions, and these situational aspects are referred to by Jones and Nisbett(1972) as historical data.First, historical data concern the expansive, yet momentary context of anaction (Frandsen & Clement, 1984). For example, receivers and/or sources canhave background information about themselves, the other person involved in thescenario, or even outsiders indirectly involved, and they can also obtain importantdata during the specific interaction taking place. Second, historical data affectattributions. For instance, if a male supervisor is known to behave in a certaininformation will affect the way people perceive him. On the other hand, if noprior information is known about the supervisor, the newly-hired female mighthave to rely on her immediate perceptions of the situation or act in order toestablish attributions.condescending manner when female subordinates are in his office, this existing9It is important to note that in situations where no historical data is available,for instance, a new employee having no prior information about the culture of acompany, attributions are often based only on effect and cause data. Since thisinvestigation is concerned specifically with situations where no historical data isavailable, further discussions will center on effect and cause data.The second type, effect data, can be illustrated by the following scenario.In a sexual harassment situation, where the source uses verbally-aggressivemessages and proxemic violations, the receiver might ultimately interpret theactions negatively, thus a negative outcome or effect insues. The effect data is theact itself and the negative outcome (Frandsen & Clement, 1984). It is important tonote, however, that some outcomes can be interpreted positively and producepositive effects (Burgoon & Hale, 1988).Third, there are cause data. This type consists of environmental or externalindicators, such as money, respect, consent or endorsement, and they weigh thethe questions, \"What motivated this person to act, and what was his/herIntentionality is one key factor to consider when interpreting cause data.Forsterling (1988) explained that according to Heider (1958), \"information ...about the presence of local causality is examined in order to decide between(p. 122). Cause data consist of intentional or internal indicators, which refer tointentional (personal causality) and non-intentional (impersonal causality) causes”objective?\"\"difficulty of tasks\" (Frandsen & Clement, 1984, p. 356). Cause data help answer10plans or efforts. “Jones and Davis reasoned that human actions are often explainedby the attribution of stable, relatively invariant dispositions to the actor. In theirtheory, the knowledge and ability of the actor were held to determine theattribution of intention” (cited in Jaspars, Fincham, & Hewstone, 1983, p. 37).Jones and Davis (1965) further developed Heider’s (1958) perspective bysuggesting that there are two requirements of intentionality: knowing that theaction will indeed result in an effect, and being able to actually produce the effect.Reardon (1991) noted that the concept of intention becomes important to Heider’stheory when he distinguishes between personal/internal and impersonal/externalcausality. “Personal attributions are formulated only when the individual observedappears to have performed a purposive action” (p. 168). Intent, purposivemotivations, can be directly linked to a source's responsibility.In fact, the literature suggests that in order to reach attributions ofresponsibility, intent must first be established. For example, as seen in Heider’s(1958) work, his emphasis became less about the factors that might producedifferentiating between varying degrees of personal responsibility.Responsibility is the second key factor to consider when interpreting causedata. Mongeau, Hale, and Alles (1994) explained that Heider also developedseveral conceptions of responsibility that vary in complexity. These ideas rangefrom association, commission, and foreseeable, to intentional and justifiable.“Heider’s (1958) simplest notion, association, involves those situations where a“overattribution” to personal causality than on the practical process involved in11person is considered responsible because he or she was associated with a negativeoutcome although he or she was not considered the event’s causal agent” (p. 327).To further illustrate, if a manager is told by her supervisor to deliver anotice of termination to a certain employee, it is possible for the employee to holdthe manager responsible for this devastating news, simply because she isassociated closely with the supervisor. The employee might, in fact, know that thenotice was entirely the supervisor's decision, but he might attribute responsibilityto the manager for not adequately defending him to the supervisor. In thisexample, the manager was considered responsible because she was associated withthe negative outcome, even though she was not the cause of the event.Mongeau, Hale, and Alles (1994) go on to discuss the variance betweenassociation and commission. “Association differs from commission because at thelatter level, the actor’s behavior caused a negative outcome for another person,though the actor neither intended nor foresaw the outcome resulting from thebehavior” (p. 327). For example, if the same manager had gone to the supervisorto complain about the way in which this employee was behaving during lunchbreak, and the supervisor, based on the manager's complaint, decided that insteadof just warning the employee, he would terminate his position with the company.In this case, commission is seen in the fact that the manager caused the negativeoutcome for the employee, but never thought that a simple complaint would resultin the employee being fired.12Heider’s third level, foreseeable, involves those cases “where the actor didnot intend to produce the negative outcome, but should have been able to foreseethe outcome resulting from the behavior” (Mongeau, Hale, & Alles, 1994, p. 327).Now, consider that the employee had received a prior warning from the supervisorfor his inappropriate behavior. The manager stops by her supervisor's office tocomplain about this employee, forgetting that the supervisor had previousgrievances with regard to the worker. The employee is subsequently fired, andholds the manager responsible for causing the termination. The manager did notintend for the employee to be terminated, but should have foreseen thisoccurrence.“As the name suggests, the fourth level, intentional, involves those cases(Mongeau, Hale, & Alles, 1994, p. 327). This level is easily illustrated byconsidering that the manager wanted to get the employee, so she purposelycomplained to her supervisor, thus causing the employee to be terminated.Finally, the most complex construct of responsibility justifiability,represents those cases where an actor intends to produce the negative outcome foranother person. The actor’s responsibility for the action, however, is attenuated bythe circumstances surrounding the behavior” (Mongeau, Hale, & Alles, 1994, p.327). For example, the manager purposely complained to her supervisor aboutthe employee, in order to get him fired. She knew of the employee's priorwarnings, and she also knew that unless this particular employee was terminated,where the actor intended to produce the negative outcome for another person”113the employees' morale in her department would continue to suffer. She also knewthat managers in other departments were anticipating a quick solution to thisproblem because her employee's actions had negatively affected personnel in otherdepartments. In this example, the manager caused the termination to take placewhen it did, due to her complaint. She intended to have the employee fired, butbecause of her knowledge of the detrimental affects that this employee had had onothers, and her knowledge of his prior verbal and written warnings, she is held lessresponsible for the outcome because her actions were justified.In these five levels, the differences in responsibility are evident, and theinherent connection between responsibility and intent is obvious. However, notonly are the elements of intentionality and responsibility central to interpretingcause data and, in general, attribution research, but attributions ofblameworthiness are as well. For example, Shaver (1985) reasoned that theseclassifications of responsibility represent a continuum of blameworthiness, and asource's intent in producing the negative outcome is the element that distinguishesthese classifications. Here, the literature suggests that in order for attributions ofblameworthiness to occur, intent and responsibility must first be established.Before the discussion of blameworthiness develops, some considerationmust be given to the communicative actions or behaviors that a person commits, inorder to evaluate his/her supposed intent and responsibility. As discussedpreviously, the two behaviors that this investigation is interested in studying are14verbally aggressive messages, and proxemic violations. First, a review of verbalaggressiveness will be explained.Verbally Aggressive MessagesVerbally aggressive messages are defined in the literature as beinginsulting, inappropriate statements which are designed to attack a person's self­concept and/or make that person feel threatened (Greenberg, 1976; Ifert &Bearden, 1998; Infante & Wigley III, 1986; Teven, Martin, & Neupauer, 1998).As Infante and Wigley III (1986) noted, there are many kinds of verballyaggressive messages, and these messages often include insults, maledictions, andprofanity.A commonality exists among all of these destructive types of verballyaggressive messages, and that is the common thread of hostility (Infante & WigleyIII, 1986; Teven, Martin, & Neupauer, 1998). The literature suggests that even ifone views verbal aggressiveness as a personality trait, rather than a message trait,the element of hostility still exists inherent in the personality (Infante & WigleyIII, 1986).Verbally aggressive messages are defined in this report as insultingcomments, coercive, discriminatory, inappropriate to a business or professionalrelationship (Gutek, 1985), and/or hostile statements. In addition, verballyaggressive statements are often, by nature, hostile, threatening, offensive messagesaimed at intimidating the receiver. Interestingly, this is an important point, when15one considers the definitions of sexual harassment. There is a significant similaritybetween these types of statements and sexually harassing remarks. For example,according to EEOC Guidelines (1990), sexual harassment is defined as quid proquo advances or requests (\"this for that\"), and the creation of a hostile workenvironment. Please note the following explanation of hostile work environment:sexual harassment when such conduct has the purpose or effect ofunreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creatingand intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment\" (EEOCGuidelines, 1990).Also, Gutek (1985) reported results from a study on the nature of sexualharassment that revealed connections between verbal aggressiveness and sexualharassment. Concerning the question, what is sexual harassment, Gutek reportedthat 70.3 percent of males and 85.5 percent of females surveyed indicated thatverbally aggressive insulting comments characterize this behavior.The literature not only suggests that verbally aggressive messages andsexually harassing statements are similar in nature, but it also suggests thatcomparable to sexual harassment, verbally aggressive messages are also intendedto produce negative effects. \"The intention of a verbally aggressive message is tohurt the other person\" (Teven, Martin, & Neupauer, 1998) and threaten orintimidate them. Infante and Wigley III (1986) state that the damage from theUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal orphysical conduct of a sexual nature constitute \"hostile work environment\"16negative effects of verbally aggressive messages are often more injurious andlonger lasting than that of physical aggression.Shaver (1985) claims that as the receiver's perception of the source’s intentto produce negative outcomes increases, so do perceptions of that actor’sresponsibility, and thus, blameworthiness for producing the negative outcomes.According to Shaver's (1985) sequential model of the attribution of blame, once asource's intent and responsibility have been established by the receiver, thenattributions of blame may begin.Therefore, based upon the literature regarding attributions of blame andperceptions of verbal aggressiveness, it is expected that when messages areperceived by observers as being high in verbal aggressiveness rather than low inverbal aggressiveness, then attributions of source blameworthiness increase.Hypothesis 1 - Attributions of source blameworthiness are higher whenmessages are perceived as being high in verbal aggressiveness than low inverbal aggressiveness.Proxemic ViolationsOne physical, nonverbal form of sexual harassment includes unwantedproximity. This unwanted proximity is also referred to as a violation of proxemicexpectations (Burgoon, 1982). Communication scholars often study nonverbalimmediacy behaviors in relation to touch, gaze, direct body orientation, andforward lean (Anderson & Guerrero, 1998). However, in addition to these areas.17commonly used nonverbal behavior (Altman, 1975; Burgoon & Jones, 1976;Hickson and Stacks, 1985; Knapp, 1978; and LaFrance & Mayo, 1978).Hall (1959) defined proxemics as the study of how man unconsciouslystructures microspace. Altman (1975) made distinctions among primary.secondary, and public territories. First, primary territories include such places ashomes, offices, bedrooms - “even a patient’s bed in a hospital qualifies as aprimary territory” (Burgoon, Buller, & Woodall, 1989, p. 96). In secondaryterritories, formal or unspoken association to a group frequently decides who has aright of entry to the territory. Public territories aren't used exclusively by anycertain group. Beaches and parks are some examples of public territories.Flail (1968) offered his explanation of three basic types of space whichincluded (1) fixed-feature space -stationary, motionless items (2) semifixed-feature space - items that can be moved, and (3) informal space - \"interpersonaldistance\" between people. Hall (1968) also categorized informal space into fourdifferent types: intimate, personal, social, and public. As Leathers (1997) noted.themselves from others in order to satisfy their various needs”(p. 92). These typespersonal distance, (1 A - 4 ft); Type 3, social distance, (4-12 feet); and PublicDistance, (12 feet or more). Burgoon and Jones’ (1976) research also support thiscategorization.the study of proxemics is frequently reported in communication literature as aof informal distance were Type 1 - intimate distance, (0-18 inches); Type 2 -\"Hall (1968) identified and classified the distances people use to separate18Additionally, Burgoon, Buller, and Woodall (1989) suggest, \"The essentialroles that spatial perception play in growth, development, and protection of theorganism argue for a primacy of proxemic messages that may be unequaled by(p. 118). Burgoon and Hale (1988) note, \"In the case of the [nonverbalexpectancy) violations model, the arousal change is posited to cause an alertnessor orienting response that diverts attention away from the ostensive purpose of theinteraction and focuses it toward the source of the arousal - the initiator of theviolation\" (p. 62).This notion is consistent with the idea that deviant behaviors make peoplemore observant of specific details about the deviant person (Langer, 1978; Langer& Imber, 1980). In Burgoon and Hale's (1988) nonverbal expectancy violationsmodel, social norms and known idiosyncracies of the other characterize nonverbalexpectancies. Therefore, when no historical data, or known idiosyncracies of theother are available, cognitive and affective expectancies of the immediate actionare based primarily on social norms. For instance, when a newly-hired femaleemployee is approached by a male coworker, and she has no prior informationabout this person, she will define expected proximity based on societal norms.This would mean that for her, appropriate, normal and/or expected proximityapproached her within an intimate space, the social norm would be violated, thus aother codes. They have the capacity to arrest the attention of the receiver”would remain between social and personal space. If, however, the male coworker19proxemic violation would take place. Yet, what outcome or effect might this haveon the female?Littlejohn (1999) stated, “The common assumption is that whenexpectancies are met, the other person’s behaviors are judged as positive, andwhen they are violated, the behaviors are judged as negative” (p. 144). AlthoughBurgoon and Hale (1988) contend that the effects of nonverbal violations can beboth negative and positive, when these proxemic violations are combined withperceived verbal aggressiveness, it can be assumed that the outcome will beperceived as negative.Not only do proxemic messages cause immediate responses, but theseresponses are often negative when proxemic violations occur, and according to theliterature, the sources of these violations often use proxemic violations tocommunicate intent. Therefore, based on expectancy violation research andattribution theories concerned with intent, responsibility and blame, it is expectedthat when proxemic violations are perceived to occur, rather than when noproxemic violation takes place, then attributions of source blameworthinessincrease.Hypothesis 2 - Attributions of source blameworthiness are higher whenproximity is perceived to be violated than when there is no proxemicviolation.20Chapter IIMethodsPilot StudyFifty undergraduate students from a mid-sized south-eastern universitywere randomly selected to participate in the first part of the pilot study. Theseparticipants were asked to write three different messages, (one message per one 3x 5 index card), that they considered to be verbally aggressive and sexuallyharassing. One hundred and sixteen messages were collected, and rated todetermine high, medium, low, and neutral verbally aggressive messages wasperformed by graduate teaching assistants at the same university. After allmessages were sorted and subsequently numbered, six messages from the high,medium, and low categories were randomly selected for the second part of thepilot study. (Messages grouped in the neutral category were set aside asunusable.)One hundred and twenty-five undergraduate students from a mid-sizedsouth-eastern university were randomly selected to participate in this investigation.The eighteen different messages were written on a questionnaire which instructedparticipants to rate each message on 7-point Likert-type scale according to thedegree that they considered the message to be verbally aggressive (see AppendixA). Verbally aggressive messages were defined on the questionnaire and repeated1121orally for the participants as insulting comments, coercive, discriminatory,inappropriate and/or hostile statements.Next, frequency analyses were performed on the responses to select sixmessages for the main study: three messages rated high in verbal agressivenessand three messages rated low in verbal aggressiveness. A paired sample t-testshowed a significant mean difference between high (M = 5.06; SD = 1.13) and low(M ~ 3.16; SD = 1.66) verbally aggressive messages, t= 15.42, p .001.Experimental ManipulationIn order to operationalize the variables for this study, four differentvideotaped scenarios were created. Qualified individuals from thecommunications discipline reviewed the videotaped scenarios to ensure that theyindeed showed the intended manipulations. Based on results obtained from thepilot study, each video portrayed a female employee who was approached by amale coworker who proceeded to direct three verbally aggressive messages at her.Participants were told that the female employee had recently been hired at a localcompany, she had only been working there for one week, therefore she did notknow anyone. This established the fact that no prior historical data was availableto the receiver (female employee) of these communication behaviors on which tobase her attributions.In the first video, the male employee entered the female's office, closed thedoor behind him, and after approaching the coworker, and sitting approximately22six inches away, (angled in the same body position as she), directed threemessages towards her which had been previously rated in the pilot study as beinghigh in verbal aggressiveness. The first manipulation was labelled High VerbalAggressiveness/Proxemic Violation Condition (HVA/PV).In this second video, the male employee entered the female's office, closedthe door behind him, and after approaching the coworker, and standingapproximately six feet away, (angled in the same body position as she), hedirected three messages towards her which had been previously rated in the pilotstudy as being low in verbal aggressiveness. The second manipulation waslabelled Low Verbal Aggressiveness/ No Proxemic Violation Condition(LVA/NPV).In this third video, the male employee entered the female's office, closedthe door behind him, and after approaching the coworker, and standingapproximately six feet away, (angled in the same body position as she), hedirected three messages towards her which had been previously rated in the pilotstudy as being high in verbal aggressiveness. The third manipulation was labelledHigh Verbal Aggressiveness/No Proxemic Violation Condition (HVA/NPV).In the fourth video, the male employee entered the female's office, closedthe door behind him, and after approaching the coworker, and sittingapproximately six inches away, (angled in the same body position as she), directedthree messages towards her which had been previously rated in the pilot study as23being low in verbal aggressiveness. The fourth manipulation was labelled LowVerbal Aggressiveness/ Proxemic Violation Condition (LVA/PV).ParticipantsA student-sample of eighty-four undergraduates (34 males, 50 females;mean age = 21.4) from a mid-sized south-eastern university participated in thestudy. Extra credit points were offered to students who participated in theexperiment.ProcedureParticipants were given an information sheet before the experiment beganwhich described the study (see Appendix B). Participants were told that the studyconcerned how people perceive and interpret communication behaviors.Individuals who volunteered to participate were given a sign-up sheet so theycould select a time most convenient for them. Each of the four videotapedscenarios was randomly selected to be shown at the different times offered to thevolunteers. Participants, who reported to the experiment at their selected times,D). fhe first part of the questionnaire was used to measure and assess subjects’perceptions of the independent variable of verbally aggressive messages. Thesecond part of the questionnaire was used to measure and assess subjects'perceptions of the independent variable of proximity (Appendix E). The third partwere given a folder containing a four-part survey questionnaire (Appendices C &24used to measure and assess subjects' perceptions of thedependent variable of source blameworthiness (Appendix F). And the fourth partof the survey questionnaire was used to identify demographic information:gender, age, work experience, known sexual harassment encounters (self orothers), and also the degree to which participants thought the videotaped scenariowas realistic and/or true-to-life (Appendix G).After participants received their survey questionnaire and were seated in thelaboratory, they were asked to view one of the four, randomly selected videotapedscenarios. After all the participants viewed the video, they were asked to silentlyread the same set of three verbally aggressive messages that were shown in thevideo. After the participants read the first message, they were asked to rate fivedifferent statements, on a 7-point Likert-type scale, according to the degree towhich they agreed or disagreed with each statement.

The verbal aggressiveness score was computed for each ofthe three messages by computing the mean of the five scores for each message,and then an overall aggressiveness score was computed by taking the mean of thethree means. An independent sample t-test indicated a significant mean differencebetween the high verbal aggressiveness condition (M = 6.32; SD = .67) and thelow verbal aggressiveness condition (M = 5.33; SD = .90), t_~ 5.76, p<.001.Proxemic Violation Manipulation CheckA five-item, seven-point Likert type scale was used to assess participants'perceptions of proxemic violation (alpha = .83). The proximity score wasobtained by computing the mean of the five scores. An independent sample t-testrevealed a significant mean difference between the proxemic violation condition(M = 5.20; SD = 1.20) and the non-proxemic violation condition (M = 3.48;SD = 1.26), t = 6.41, E<.001.27Dependent MeasureResearch in the literature review indicated blame to be a unidimensionalitem. Thus, blameworthiness was assessed using a five-item, seven-point Likerttype scale. However, the reliability coefficient was .49, which indicated arelatively low internal consistency among the five items in the present study. Anitem-to-item correlation matrix was obtained to investigate the degree to whichthose items correlated to each other.

However, items four and five were not correlated with any other item.A factor analysis was performed to further investigate the relationship amongthese five items. Results indicated significant factor loadings on the primaryTable 1Blameworthiness: Item to Item Correlation Matrix**p < .01.*P28blameworthiness component only for the first three items.

Henry and Meltzoff (1998) stated, \"The mostpowerful and consistent variable that has been found to influence perceptions ofsexual harassment is sex of the person who makes that judgment\" (p. 255).Researchers concerned with gender and attributions of blame for sexualharassment situations (Kenig & Ryan, 1986) found that women are less likely thanmen to attribute responsibility for harassment to the victim.The first hypothesis proposed that when messages are perceived as high inviolated. Results showed no significant effect of proxemic violation onmessages are perceived as low in verbal aggressiveness. Results revealed ablameworthiness, F(l, 80) = 11.4,p < .01, eta2 = .12. Therefore, consistent with130Finally, Johnson and Workman (1994) noted the Calhoun, Selby, andWaring (1976) study which examined the issue of sex of subject. Male subjectsindicated assaults were attributed to the victims' traits to a greater extent than didsignificantly more by males than by females\" (Johnson & Workman, 1994, p.384).Gender EffectsBased on the research, it can be concluded that in sexual harassmentsituations, it is possible for observers' gender to influence perceptions. Therefore,gender effect was tested with a 2 (low / high verbal aggressiveness) by 2 (noproxemic violation / proxemic violation) by 2 (male / female) factorial analysis ofvariance.

In this study, it was found that blamedecreases as verbal aggressiveness decreases. Results indicated that a receiver'sperception of source blameworthiness is partly a function of a source's verbalbehavior. More specifically, evidence was found which indicated that the messageitself is not what affects a receiver's perceptions of source blameworthiness.Source blameworthiness appears to be affected by the receiver's interpretation andevaluation of the message, and subsequently, how that message affects theperceiver's feelings and emotions.One interesting finding in this investigation was the much smallerdifference between high and low verbal aggressiveness scores as compared to thatscored in the pilot study. Although three low verbally aggressive messages wereblameworthiness. The results from this study further demonstrate that there is a34selected from the pilot study, these messages were perceived as being relativelyhigh in the main study (M = 5.33), as compared to the pilot study (M = 3.16). Apossible explanation for this difference is that the participants in the main studyviewed the videotaped scenario, which might have depicted a more vividillustration of these messages for the observers, whereas the participants in thepilot study only read the messages. No contextual indicators were given to theparticipants in the pilot study, which might have influenced their responses. Insexual harassment situations, this could mean that when messages are taken out ofcontext, the evaluations and interpretations of those messages will be greatlyaffected. The implication for sexual harassment cases is that messages cannot betaken out of context without serious consequences.However, although the difference between the two levels of verballyaggressive messages was minimized in the main study, statistically significantreductions in blame were still found. This is an important finding with regard toreceivers’ perceptions. For instance, even the slightest variation in how anindividual feels about a message, how that message affects his or her emotions andpsychological response, significantly affects attributions of the source. Peoplecan detect subtle differences in messages, they are affected by their interpretationsof those messages, and finally they base their attributions of the source on theirinterpretations and feelings about those messages. Thus, attributions are based onthe different cues available to the receiver.35One limitation of this study might be that each verbal message in the studywas not only found to be verbally aggressive, but was also found to have sexualcontent. Perhaps as long as messages have sexual content, the source is evaluatedas being more liable, more accountable, and more blameworthy. Therefore, noclear distinction can be drawn for verbally aggressive and sexually explicitmessages. It would be important, and interesting, for researchers to focus futureinvestigations on manipulating sexually explicit messages as compared to verballyaggressive messages with sexual content. For example, researchers couldoperationalize variables by using sexually explicit messages with the samecontent, but adding a politeness cue at the end of the message (i.e. \"please\", \"ifyou don't mind\") to test the impact that these cues have on the receivers.Another question that needs to be addressed, possibly in future research, isto what extent does blame decrease, when messages are perceived as low or evenneutral in sexual content? Due to the higher verbal aggressiveness ratingsregarding the messages, this study did not answer or address that issue.Also, the issue of gender needs to be investigated in future research. Why didmales attribute significantly less blame to the source in the low verbal aggressive /proxemic violation condition than the low verbal aggressive / no proxemicviolation condition? One possible explanation lies in the design of themanipulation. The female receiver in the videotaped scenarios, was instructedprior to taping, not to react or respond, either by changes in her facial expressionsor by verbal reactions. This lack of response to an initial encounter might be the36reason for the difference in participants' responses. Perhaps this suggests thatmale participants identified with the male source. While putting themselves in hisplace, they believed that even though the source's behavior was intentional and he,alone, was responsible for his behavior, without a direct confrontation or reactionfrom the receiver, less blame should be imputed to the source. In this case, theparticipants were equating blameworthiness with eventual physical consequenceor punishment. Why should he be punished or suffer negative consequences if shedid not acknowledge her discomfort or negative feelings associated with hisbehavior? In fact, during the debriefing of participants, this very issue was raisedby more than three male participants in different conditions.No evidence was found to support Hypothesis Two, and this could partly bea result of overwhelming nature of the verbally aggressive message. Resultsseemed to indicate such high scores for the verbal message, that participantsperhaps having compared the verbal messages to the nonverbal behavior ofproxemic violations, felt that in this type of situation proximity violations did notmatter as much as the verbal aggressiveness. It was surprisingly found that in thelow verbal aggressiveness and proxemic violation condition, participants rated theproxemic violation condition. Once again, one reasonable explanation for thiscould lie in the receiver's lack of response to the behavior. It is possible thatobservers felt that when the message was low in verbal aggressiveness and thesource significantly lower in blame than in the low verbal aggressiveness and nosource approached the receiver within her \"interpersonal, intimate space\" as37defined by Hall (1968), and she did not show any verbal or nonverbal signs ofthreat or discomfort, her lack of reaction/response was interpreted by the observersas an acceptance or positive evaluation of the behavior.Although the literature suggests that intent, responsibility and blame are allconnected and build on each other in the perceptual processes of the attribution ofblame, intent and responsibility were not correlated with the other three elementsof blameworthiness: liability, accountability, and blame. This finding deservesfurther attention from researchers.The implications of this study suggest a need for more research in the areaof source characteristics. In particular, researchers should focus on sexualharassment situations where the source is blamed even though the messages wereperceived to be neutral or low in verbal aggressiveness. Also, more researchshould focus on investigating the reasons why male observers more so than femaleobservers attribute lower scores of blameworthiness to sources of verballyaggressive messages.38AppendicesPAGEAPPENDIX TITLEPilot Study Questionnaire 39AInformational Sheet 40BLow Verbal Aggressiveness Instrument 41CHigh Verbal Aggressiveness Instrument 42DProxemic Violation Instrument 43EBlameworthiness InstrumentF 44General InformationG 4539Appendix APilot Study QuestionnaireIf a person, male or female, says to you...I) 1 2 2 64 5 72) 1 2 4 5 6 73) 21 3 4 5 6 74) If you sleep with me, I’ll give you a pay raise. 1 2 3 64 5 75) If you don’t give me what 1 want, 1 will take it. 31 2 4 5 6 76) I’d like to take you home tonight and fuck you. 1 2 5 64 77) Hey baby, you’re ass looks great. 1 2 4 5 6 78) You’ve got some really huge breasts. 1 2 2 4 65 79) I want your body. 2 3 61 4 5 710) 1 hate your mind, but 1 love your body. 6I 2 3 4 5 7Your ass looks really good.H) 61 2 3 4 5 7Can I just touch your ass.12) 21 4 5 6 7Nice body, have you been working out.13) 1 2 3 4 65 714) You need to be with a real man/woman. 2 4 61 5 715) Right here, right now. 1 2 4 5 6 7Wide load.16) 61 2 3 4 5 7Hey sexy, nice outfit.17) 2 4 61 5 718) 2 5 6 7I 4Please rank the following statements on a scale from 1 to 7 by circling the appropriate number.

    "abstract": "As society moves into the 21st century, sexual harassment remains a major problem in organizations (Buttny, 1993; Cockburn, 1991; Kreps, 1993; Langelan, 1993; Simons & Weissman, 1990; Taylor & Daly, 1995; Wolfson,1997). The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, made it illegal to discriminate against employees regarding race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, but at that point in time, the phrase  sexual harassment” had no meaning. Although women were aware of their daily struggles with gender discrimination in the workplace, no one had coined the phrase, and this pervasive problem was not yet an established part of the legal system.\nIn the 1970s, the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace came to the attention of the public and the government via media and the feminist movement. During the early part of this decade, feminists defined sexual harassment as  an expression of power and a form of sex discrimination” (Bingham, 1994, p. 3). Studies focused on sexual harassment as being rooted in male dominance and privilege in the workplace. According to Bingham (1994), this definition continued to evolve throughout the decade to include such diversities as race, ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation among women",
