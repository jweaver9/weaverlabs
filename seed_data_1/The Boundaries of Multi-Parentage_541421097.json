THE BOUNDARIES OF MULTI-PARENTAGEJessica Feinberg*ABSTRACTMulti-parentage has arrived. In recent years, a growing number of courtsand legislatures have recognized that a child may have more than two legalparents. A number of significant societal, medical, and legal developmentshave contributed to the trend toward multi-parentage recognition. Thetraditional family structure of a married different-sex couple and their bio-logical children currently represents only a minority of U.S. families. Step-parents, non-marital partners of legal parents, and extended familymembers often play a significant role in children’s lives, and it has becomeincreasingly common for same-sex couples to welcome children into theirfamilies. In addition, advancements in assisted reproductive technologyhave made it possible for a greater number of parties to play a role in achild’s conception. At the same time, the law has expanded both the catego-ries of individuals who are eligible to establish parentage and the mecha-nisms through which parentage can be established. While the trend in favorof multi-parentage recognition is clear, the boundaries of multi-parentageremain largely unsettled. It is imperative that in drafting their multi-parent-age laws, states carefully consider how to address a number of importantquestions. These questions include, for example, whether each of the child’sexisting legal parents must consent to the establishment of multi-parentage,what (if any) cap should be set on the number of individuals who canestablish legal parentage, and how to avoid imposing a hetero- and bio-normative family structure on LGBTQ+ families. After providing a de-tailed analysis of the complex issues involved in each of these questions, theArticle sets forth a number of proposals regarding how states should ad-dress these critical questions within their multi-parentage laws.TABLE OF CONTENTSI.

INTRODUCTIONFOR most of U.S. history, the law identified a maximum of two par-ents for each child. In recent years, however, legislatures andcourts have become increasingly willing to recognize the possibilitythat a child may have more than two parents (multi-parentage). A num-ber of jurisdictions have adopted statutes providing for the identificationof more than two legal parents under certain circumstances, and judicialdecisions in additional jurisdictions have reached the same result.1 Thereis currently a clear trend toward legal recognition of multi-parentage, andthis trend shows no signs of slowing down.2A variety of factors have contributed to the move away from strict ad-herence to the “rule of two.”3 In recognizing a maximum of two parentsfor each child, the law has long sought to “naturalize a normative familyin which only enduringly monogamous heterosexual couples reproduce.”4Today, however, the “traditional” nuclear family consisting of a marrieddifferent-sex couple and their genetic children represents only a minorityof family structures in the United States, and a significant number of chil-dren have more than two individuals in their lives who serve in a parentalrole.5 For example, the rate of births outside of marriage and the rate ofdivorce each remain around 40% or higher.6 As a result, stepparents,non-marital partners of legal parents, and extended family membersoften play significant roles in children’s lives and may form relationshipswith children that are parental in nature.7 Moreover, it has become in-creasingly common for same-sex couples to have children, and somesame-sex couples have chosen to create family structures in which thecouple and a third party whose gametes were used to conceive the child(and perhaps the gamete provider’s spouse or partner) raise the child to-gether as co-parents.81.

The use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) hasbecome increasingly common among both same-sex couples who wish toconceive children and different-sex couples who are confronting fertilityissues.9 Advancements in ART mean that five or more people may bedirectly involved in the conception of a child: the providers of the ga-metes used to conceive the child, the person who gestates the child, andthe intended parents.10 Moreover, it is likely that advances in medicaltechnology will soon result in the ability to conceive children using thegametes of three individuals, leading to the reality of a child having morethan two genetic parents.11Along with these societal and medical developments have come impor-tant legal developments. The law has both expanded the categories ofindividuals who can utilize the traditional mechanisms available for par-entage establishment (marriage, adoption, and biology) and added im-portant additional parentage establishment mechanisms. Members ofsame-sex couples, for example, now can use traditional marriage-basedavenues—such as the marital presumption of parentage, spousal consentto assisted reproduction laws, and stepparent adoption procedures—toobtain legal parentage.12 In addition, states across the country have sup-plemented their traditional parentage establishment mechanisms with avariety of intent- and function-based mechanisms, meaning that there aremore bases on which an individual may establish legal parentage thanever before.13 Taken together, these societal, medical, and legal develop-ments have led to a situation in which it is increasingly common for morethan two people to seek recognition as a child’s legal parent.14Rather than joining the well-developed debate regarding the baselinequestion of whether the law should recognize the possibility of a childhaving more than two legal parents,15 this Article instead seeks to addresswhat boundaries the law should adopt in setting forth a logical, fair, andeffective legal framework governing multi-parentage determinations.

LAWS. 175 (2018).2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 311gal recognition of multi-parentage is a relatively new concept.16 The juris-dictions that have recognized multi-parentage through statute or courtdecision have employed varying approaches, and the boundaries of multi-parentage recognition remain very much unsettled. Of particular impor-tance are questions relating to (1) whether the consent of all the existinglegal parents should be required for the law to recognize additional legalparents and, if so, whether the definition of consent should encompassboth express and implied consent; (2) what (if any) cap states should seton the number of individuals who can obtain legal parentage; and (3) howto structure multi-parentage laws in a way that avoids imposing a hetero-and bio-normative family structure on LGBTQ+ families.17 Each of thesequestions raises complex legal and policy-related issues.The first question, regarding the consent of a child’s existing legal par-ents to the establishment of multi-parentage, raises complicated legal is-sues. The analysis necessarily involves weighing the fundamentalconstitutional rights of the existing legal parents to direct the care, cus-tody, and control of their child against the state’s interest in protectingthe well-being of children who have formed a parent-like relationshipwith a third party. With regard to the second question, whether statesshould set a firm cap on the number of parents the law can recognize,there are strong policy considerations on each side. On the one hand,having too many individuals recognized as a child’s legal parents couldlead to chaos and conflict that is detrimental to the child. On the otherhand, having the state choose one number as the absolute maximumnumber of legal parents a child could possibly have is arguably arbitraryand unwise given the wide variety of family forms in existence today andthe unique attributes of every family. Resolving the third question, howto protect LGBTQ+ families from imposition of a hetero- and bio-norma-tive family structure, will be a complex undertaking that will requirestates to carefully construct each component of their laws in a way thatminimizes the potential for anti-LGBTQ bias to play a determinative rolein multi-parentage decisions. Overall, in structuring their multi-parentagelaws, it is essential that states give each of these questions thorough con-sideration—the manner in which states choose to address these questionswill have profound and lasting effects on children, parents, and families.This Article proceeds in the following manner. Part II describes each ofthe modern bases through which individuals can establish legal parent-age. Part III begins by identifying the common factual scenarios in whichmulti-parentage issues may arise. It then sets forth a detailed descriptionof the current state of the law governing multi-parentage in the UnitedStates. Part IV identifies three of the most important unsettled questionsregarding how states should structure the boundaries of multi-parentage16. Appleton, supra note 4, at 12–13 (explaining that the issue of “whether particularchildren can or should have more than two parents, surfaced with seeming suddenness” in2007).17. As per Professor Katharine K. Baker, the term bionormative in this context refersto “a parental regime based on biology.” Baker, supra note 15, at 653.312 SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 75recognition. After engaging in a thorough analysis of the legal and policy-related issues underlying each question, the Article sets forth a number ofdetailed proposals regarding how states should address each of these crit-ical questions.II. MODERN BASES FOR PARENTAGE ESTABLISHMENTA. THE ACT OF GIVING BIRTHThe law has long provided legal parentage based upon the act of givingbirth,18 and that remains largely true today. At present, the only scenarioin which legal parentage does not attach to the act of giving birth is whenstate law recognizes a surrogacy agreement as establishing the intendedparents as the child’s sole legal parents prior to or upon the child’sbirth.19 In the absence of an enforceable surrogacy agreement, the lawwidely continues to provide legal parentage based upon the act of givingbirth.20 This longstanding practice not only reflects a recognition of thecritically important, substantial caregiving work and nurturing under-taken by individuals who gestate and give birth to children, but it alsobestows parentage to an individual who, in addition to gestating the child,is the child’s genetic and intended parent in the vast majority ofinstances.21B. THE MARITAL PRESUMPTIONThe longstanding marital presumption of parentage is the most com-mon way of establishing legal parentage in someone other than the per-son who gave birth.22 “As far back as the early 1700s, the common law ofEngland set forth a presumption that a woman’s husband was the legalfather of any child born to or conceived by the woman during the mar-riage.”23 In the early years of the United States, the marital presumptionwas virtually irrefutable.24 Rebutting the presumption required the initia-tion of legal proceedings in which the husband or wife had to prove that“the husband did not have access to his wife”25 during the time of con-ception, and neither the wife nor the husband was permitted to testify tothis fact.2618.

Glennon, supra note 23, at 562–63.26. Feinberg, supra note 23, at 248–49.2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 313While the marital presumption remains in some form in every state, therules governing the presumption have changed over the years.27 Thespouses are no longer prohibited from testifying in rebuttal actions.28 Inaddition, in approximately two-thirds of states, not only do the personwho gave birth, their spouse, and child support enforcement agencieshave standing to challenge the marital presumption, but an individualoutside of the marriage who claims to be the child’s biological father alsomay seek to rebut the presumption.29 Rebuttal usually requires, at a mini-mum, DNA testing results indicating that the spouse of the person whogave birth does not share a genetic connection with the child.30 In manystates, however, courts can refuse to admit DNA evidence or otherwisedeny rebuttal if the court determines that rebuttal would be contrary tothe child’s best interests or that the party seeking to rebut the maritalpresumption should be estopped from doing so on equitable grounds.31Importantly, pursuant to the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision inObergefell v. Hodges, which mandated that states provide marriage rightsto same-sex couples on the same terms accorded to different-sex couples,it seems clear that state marital presumption laws must extend to same-sex spouses of individuals who give birth.32 The Supreme Court’s decisiontwo years later in Pavan v. Smith, which held that if a state provides thedifferent-sex spouses of individuals who give birth with the right to belisted on the child’s birth certificate it must do the same for same-sexspouses, further supports the mandatory application of state marital pre-sumption laws to same-sex spouses of individuals who give birth.33 Thevast majority of courts that have addressed the issue have reached theconclusion that state marital presumptions, even if written in genderedterms, apply equally to same-sex spouses.34 In addition, a number ofstates have amended their marital presumption laws so that gender-neu-tral terms are used to describe the spouse of the individual who gavebirth.35C. VOLUNTARY ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OF PARENTAGEToday, voluntary acknowledgements of parentage (VAPs), which areusually executed at the hospital at the time of the child’s birth,36 are themost common way of establishing a second legal parent for a child born27.

An unrescinded VAP must be “considered a legal find-ing of paternity,”42 and states must give “full faith and credit” to VAPsvalidly executed in other states.43 Although federal law only requiresstates to provide VAPs to establish the paternity of children born “out-of-wedlock,”44 approximately half of states allow a married individual whogives birth to execute a VAP with someone other than their spouse if thespouse is willing to execute a document declaring that they are not thechild’s biological father and waiving their presumed legal parentage.4537.

REV. 325, 351–53 (2019).316 SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 75D. GENETICSActual or presumed genetic ties to the child have long played a role inparentage determinations.52 In situations where a child has only one ex-isting legal parent, the person who gave birth, an individual claiming tobe the child’s biological father, or a child support agency can initiate legalproceedings to establish the alleged biological father’s parentage on thebasis of DNA evidence.53 Federal law requires that state procedures “cre-ate a rebuttable or, at the option of the State, conclusive presumption ofpaternity upon genetic testing results indicating a threshold probabilitythat the alleged father is the father of the child.”54In situations in which a second individual (in addition to the personwho gave birth) is already recognized as a legal parent, an individualclaiming parentage on the basis of genetic ties to the child may be able tobring an action to establish their parentage and rebut the parentage ofthe existing second legal parent. For example, as discussed above, in two-thirds of states biological fathers have standing to seek to rebut the mari-tal presumption of parentage that attaches to the spouse of the individualwho gave birth.55 In addition, while the standing requirements for VAPchallenges differ by state, a biological father may have standing to chal-lenge a VAP that identifies someone else as the child’s second legal par-ent.56 However, genetic ties are not always determinative in thesecontexts. Courts may reject these challenges on the grounds that estab-lishing the genetic father as the child’s legal parent would be contrary tothe best interests of the child or inequitable.57 Many jurisdictions alsohave time limitations on actions to challenge an individual’s legalparentage.58Moreover, in recent years some jurisdictions have expanded to womenthe types of genetics-based parentage establishment avenues traditionallyavailable only to men.59 This has arisen primarily in the context of gesta-tional surrogacy arrangements in situations where the surrogacy agree-ment is not enforceable under the laws of the jurisdiction, but the courtallows the intended mother to establish parentage through proof that sheis the child’s genetic mother.60 In addition, a few courts have recognizedsimilar claims in the context of same-sex couples who engaged in recipro-cal in vitro fertilization (IVF), an assisted reproductive procedure52.

CONSENT TO ASSISTED REPRODUCTIONUnder existing statutory or common law rules throughout the UnitedStates, a husband who consents to his wife’s use of assisted reproductionwith the intent to be the resulting child’s parent is deemed a legal parentregardless of whether the child is conceived using the husband’s sperm ordonor sperm.64 In some jurisdictions, the laws require that the consent bein writing or that the procedure be performed under the supervision of aphysician.65 Notably, parentage established through consent to assistedreproduction laws generally is conclusive and irrefutable.66 In terms ofsame-sex couples, courts that have addressed the issue generally haveruled that, under Obergefell and Pavan, spousal consent to ART laws ex-tend to same-sex spouses.67 In addition, a growing number of states areadopting spousal consent to ART statutes that contain gender-neutralterms in reference to the class of individuals who may use this avenue toestablish their legal parentage.68A number of jurisdictions now have consent to ART laws that extendto non-marital partners. As of 2021, approximately sixteen jurisdictionshave adopted consent to ART laws that extend to an individual who con-sents to a non-marital partner’s use of ART to conceive with the intent tobe the resulting child’s parent.69 In thirteen of these jurisdictions, the law61.

SURROGACYSurrogacy typically involves an agreement between the surrogate andintended parents providing that the surrogate agrees to become pregnantthrough the use of assisted reproduction and to relinquish parental rightsto any resulting child to the intended parents.72 Only a few jurisdictionsstatutorily recognize “traditional” or “genetic” surrogacy agreements inwhich the surrogate’s ova and sperm from an intended parent donor areused to conceive the child73 (meaning the surrogate shares both geneticand gestational ties to the child).74 The other category of surrogacy, ges-tational surrogacy, is estimated to represent approximately 95% of allsurrogacy arrangements today.75 In gestational surrogacy, the surrogate isnot genetically connected to the child—ova and sperm from the intendedparent(s) or gamete donor(s) are used to create the embryo that will beimplanted in the surrogate.76Gestational surrogacy is a complex area of the law and legal regulationvaries dramatically by jurisdiction. Slightly under half of states have stat-utes that explicitly address gestational surrogacy,77 some states have onlycase law addressing gestational surrogacy,78 and still other states have nostatutory or case law governing gestational surrogacy.79 A few of thestates with statutes addressing surrogacy consider all surrogacy contractsvoid and unenforceable.80 The rest of the jurisdictions with statutes ad-dressing gestational surrogacy, approximately eighteen jurisdictions, rec-70.

ADOPTIONAll states allow for the establishment of legal parentage through judi-cial adoption proceedings.86 Most adoptions fall into one of three catego-ries: (1) “[t]he adoption of children from the public foster care system byfoster caregivers, kin, or adoptive parents chosen by the agency for thechild”; (2) “[t]he domestic adoption of infants who reside in the UnitedStates and are adopted through private adoption agencies or indepen-dently”; or (3) “[i]ntercountry adoption of infants and children fromother countries by U.S. citizens.”87 In terms of the categories of individu-als eligible to adopt children, the laws of all jurisdictions permit marriedcouples to jointly adopt children.88 After Obergefell, these laws must beapplied equally to married same-sex couples.89 In addition, single individ-uals are eligible to adopt in all jurisdictions, and a number of jurisdictions81.

PARENTAL FUNCTIONINGOver the past fifty years or so, parental functioning has emerged as abasis for the establishment of legal parentage. Common function-basedmechanisms for establishing parental rights include holding out provi-sions and equitable parenthood doctrines. Holding out provisions, whichwere rooted originally in the gendered language of the 1973 Uniform Par-entage Act, generally create a presumption of parentage for a man whoreceives a child into his home and holds the child out as his own.99 Many90.

MULTI-PARENTAGE IN THE UNITED STATESThe expansion of the methods through which parentage can be estab-lished, combined with advancements in reproductive technology and thediversity in U.S. family structures, have made it increasingly difficult forsociety and the legal system to deny the possibility of multi-parentagerecognition. This Part first describes a number of the more common sce-narios in which multi-parentage issues may arise. It then provides a de-tailed overview of the current state of legal recognition of multi-parentage in the United States.A. SITUATIONS IN WHICH MULTI-PARENTAGE ISSUES MAY ARISE1. Assisted ReproductionDue to advancements in ART, a number of individuals may be in-volved in a child’s conception or birth. This may include, for example, theproviders of the gametes used to conceive the child, the person who ges-tates the child, and the intended parents. Same-sex couples who utilizeART are particularly likely to require the involvement of third parties.This is because cisgender same-sex couples who desire to have a childwho is genetically related to one member of the couple necessarily re-quire gametes from a third party.119 Cisgender male same-sex couplesalso require the assistance of a surrogate.120 Different-sex couples whoare facing fertility issues also may require gametes from a third party or(West 2021). It is unclear whether Washington, D.C. also falls within this category of states.This is because “[t]he statute declares [only] that a de facto parent ‘shall be deemed aparent for purposes’ of a number of provisions that relate to child custody and child sup-port; it is therefore unclear what the status means in other contexts.” JOSLIN, MINTER &SAKIMURA, supra note 49, § 5:22 n.68 (quoting D.C.

Biological Fathers and Individuals with Competing Claims of LegalParentageOutside of the assisted reproduction context, multi-parentage issuesalso may arise when a biological father and another individual each seekrecognition as the child’s second legal parent. For example, a biologicalfather may seek to establish parentage, on genetics-based grounds, of achild born to an individual who was married to someone else at the timeof the child’s conception or birth. In response, the spouse may claim legalparentage based on the marital presumption. In jurisdictions that do notrecognize multi-parentage, either the spouse or the biological father, butnot both, will be recognized as the child’s parent.129 This has been trueeven where both parties have formed a relationship with the child.130 Interms of the determination of which party will be recognized as thechild’s legal parent, as discussed above, approximately two-thirds of juris-dictions give the biological father standing to rebut the presumed parent-age that attaches to the spouse pursuant to the marital presumption.131 Inmany states, however, courts can refuse to admit DNA evidence or other-wise deny rebuttal if the court determines that rebuttal would be “con-trary to the child’s best interests or that the party seeking to rebut themarital presumption should be estopped from doing so on equitablegrounds.”132 As a general matter, “[c]ourts are quite reluctant to under-cut the marital presumption when the [person who gave birth] and [theirspouse] have co-parented the child, the [spouse] has provided financialand emotional support to the child, and the child has bonded with the[spouse].”133Multi-parentage issues can also arise when a biological father seeks toestablish parentage on genetics-based grounds, and a current or former127.

For example, as discussed above, a biological fathermay have standing to challenge a VAP that identifies another individualas the child’s second legal parent.134 However, there are limited groundsfor challenging VAPs, and courts may deny such challenges, despite DNAevidence, where they determine that disestablishing the parentage of theindividual identified in the VAP would be contrary to the child’s bestinterests or equitable principles.135 Competing claims may also arise be-tween a biological father and an individual who has another basis for as-serting parentage, such as a holding out provision.136 As noted above,when these types of competing claims for parentage arise in jurisdictionsthat do not recognize multi-parentage, the court generally will make thedetermination of which party to recognize as the child’s second legal par-ent based on considerations of policy, logic, and the child’s bestinterests.1373. Remarriage or Re-Partnering by the Existing Legal ParentsMulti-parentage issues also arise when a child has two existing legalparents, and one or both of them enter into a marriage or serious rela-tionship with a third party—a common occurrence in the UnitedStates.138 For example, it is estimated that approximately one-third ofchildren will live in a household with a stepparent at some point in theirchildhood.139 Children often form important relationships that are paren-tal in nature with the spouse or partner of an existing legal parent.140These relationships may begin when the child is very young and continuefor years, and the child may view the individual in question as a parentregardless of that person’s formal legal status.141Individuals who, at some point after the child is born, enter into a rela-tionship with one of the child’s existing legal parents and wish to establishlegal parentage, generally must pursue adoption.142 As discussed above,134.

Other Involved “Non-Parents”Multi-parentage issues also may arise when a child has two legal par-ents, and someone who is neither the spouse nor partner of one the legalparents acts in a parental role to the child. Family members or friends of achild’s legal parents may take on a parental role in the child’s life, whichmay involve co-parenting with one or both of the child’s existing legalparents.145 While “kinship caregiving” occurs in all types of communities,it is particularly common in many minority communities for “relativesand close friends [to] play a critical role in caring for children.”146 Today,one in twelve children live in a household that is maintained by a grand-parent or other relative,147 and Black and Asian children are twice aslikely as White children to be living in this type of household.148Adoption is often the only option through which a kinship caregivercan establish parentage, and its availability in this context is extremelylimited.149 In states that do not recognize multi-parentage, kinshipcaregivers cannot adopt a child who has two existing legal parents.150 Inaddition, even if one of the existing legal parents agrees to terminate theirparental rights or has their rights terminated involuntarily, there often isno mechanism akin to step- or second-parent adoption available to estab-lish kinship caregivers as a child’s second legal parent alongside the re-143.

Multi-Party Romantic RelationshipsMulti-parentage issues may also arise within romantic relationships in-volving more than two people. In some cases, more than two parties mayshare a romantic relationship together and conceive the child with theintention to raise the child as a family unit.153 Multi-parentage issues alsomay arise in other forms of multi-partner relationships, including polyga-mous and polyamorous relationships in which multiple partners are in-volved, but not all of the partners share a romantic relationship with eachother.154 With the practice of consensual non-monogamy becoming morecommon (current estimates are that one in five people have engaged in itat some point),155 this is an area in which multi-parentage issues likelywill increase in the coming years.156As a general matter, like in the other contexts, in jurisdictions that donot recognize multi-parentage, the law will recognize, at most, two of theindividuals involved as the child’s legal parents. The most likely result inthese situations is that initial legal parentage will attach to the personwho gave birth and, where relevant, their spouse or the individual withwhom they executed a VAP.157 If more than one party has recognizedgrounds for establishment as the child’s second legal parent, courts mustapply the relevant standards discussed above governing rebuttal of themarital presumption, VAP challenges, or competing claims involvingother grounds for parentage establishment.1586.

LEGAL RECOGNITION OF MULTI-PARENTAGEWhile the “rule of two” remains in place in many jurisdictions, in re-cent years statutes and judicial decisions recognizing that a child can havemore than two legal parents in certain circumstances have increased sig-nificantly. As the discussion below demonstrates, there is a clear trendtoward states recognizing multi-parentage. This trend shows no signs ofslowing down, and legal recognition of multi-parentage likely will becomeeven more widespread in the coming years.1631. Statutory Recognitiona. LouisianaWhile Louisiana was the first state to recognize that a child may havemore than two legal parents,164 recognition is limited to very narrow cir-cumstances. Beginning in the 1970s, Louisiana courts began to recognizethe possibility of dual paternity in situations where the husband of theperson who gave birth was presumed to be the child’s father pursuant tothe marital presumption, but another man was established as the child’sbiological father.165 The Louisiana Supreme Court first determined thatthe biological father could be recognized as a legal parent for purposes ofa wrongful death action without the presumed father losing his parentalstatus.166 The Louisiana courts subsequently extended this ruling suchthat a biological father could be recognized as the child’s legal parent forchild support purposes without the presumed father losing his parental159.

DelawareIn Delaware, statutory recognition of multi-parentage occurs solelythrough the state’s de facto parentage law.173 The de facto parentage stat-ute was enacted in 2009.174 As noted above, Delaware is one of the statesin which an individual can establish legal parentage through satisfaction167.

CaliforniaCalifornia was the first state to pass a law providing for broad recogni-tion of multi-parentage. California’s multi-parentage law, enacted in2013, states that “a court may find that more than two persons with aclaim to parentage . . . are parents if the court finds that recognizing onlytwo parents would be detrimental to the child.”178 The law then providesguidance regarding what courts should consider in determining whetherrecognizing only two parents would be detrimental to the child. Specifi-cally, it states that in determining potential detriment, “the court shallconsider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the harm ofremoving the child from a stable placement with a parent who has ful-filled the child’s physical needs and the child’s psychological needs forcare and affection, and who has assumed that role for a substantial periodof time.”179 In addition to providing for multi-parentage in the context ofcompeting parentage claims, California law also explicitly provides forthe possibility of multi-parentage in the adoption context. The relevantprovision states that in adoption proceedings, the existing legal parent orparents can maintain their legal parentage if the prospective adoptiveparent(s) and the existing legal parent(s) all sign a waiver prior to theadoption being finalized.180Importantly, the California bill establishing these multi-parentage pro-visions includes an introductory statement explaining that “[m]ost chil-dren have two parents, but in rare cases, children have more than twopeople who are that child’s parent in every way” and further providingthat “[i]t is the intent of the Legislature that this bill will only apply in therare case where a child truly has more than two parents.”181 The courts,175.

In interpretingthe requirement that courts not recognize multi-parentage unless failingto do so would be detrimental to the child, courts have required the partyseeking recognition to demonstrate that a relationship that is parental innature continues to exist between the party and the child at the time ofthe parentage determination proceedings.182 This was demonstrated in aseries of cases involving biological fathers who satisfied the state’s hold-ing out standard for establishing parentage and sought to establish par-entage of a child who already had a mother and presumed father.183 Thecourts in these cases reached different conclusions about whether to rec-ognize the biological father as a third legal parent depending on whetherhe shared a relationship with the child that was parental in nature at thetime of the proceedings.184It is important to note that in states that recognize multi-parentage,including California, each person seeking recognition as the child’s legalparent must have a recognized basis for establishing parentage.185 WhileCalifornia recognizes most of the grounds for establishing parentage de-scribed in Part II,186 it is not one of the states through which legal parent-age can be established pursuant to an equitable parenthood doctrine.California’s de facto parenthood doctrine provides limited rights relatingto standing, custody, and visitation, but not legal parentage.187 As a re-sult, an individual cannot become the child’s third (or subsequent) parentthrough the de facto parentage doctrine—they would need to satisfy oneof the other bases described in Part II for establishing legal parentage.188Finally, California’s law governing custody disputes specifies that in casesinvolving children who have more than two legal parents, courts do nothave to award shared legal or physical custody among all of the parents if182. Compare In re Donovan L., 198 Cal. Rptr. 3d 550, 564 (Cal. Ct.

Enacted in 2015,Maine’s statute states that, “Consistent with the establishment of parent-age under this chapter, a court may determine that a child has more than[two] parents.”190 Unlike California, the Maine statute does not explicitlyrequire the court to find that failing to recognize more than two parentswould be detrimental to the child in order for multi-parentage to be es-tablished.191 Maine recognizes, in some form, each of the bases for estab-lishing parentage described in Part II.192 This includes the establishmentof parentage through satisfaction of the state’s equitable parenthooddoctrine.193e. VermontIn 2018, Vermont enacted a law providing that “a court may determinethat a child has more than two parents if the court finds that it is in thebest interests of the child to do so.”194 While Vermont, unlike Maine,explicitly requires that the court determine multi-parentage is in thechild’s best interest, it does not go as far as California in requiring thatmulti-parentage only be recognized where failing to do so would be detri-mental to the child.195 Like Maine, Vermont recognizes, in some form,each of the bases for establishing parentage described in Part II, includingthe establishment of parentage through the state’s equitable parenthooddoctrine.196f.

THE BOUNDARIES OF MULTI-PARENTAGEA. THE CONSENT OF THE EXISTING LEGAL PARENTS1. The QuestionIn the context of two-party parentage, a number of the mechanismsthrough which an individual can establish themselves as the child’s sec-ond legal parent require the consent of the existing legal parent.223 Thisincludes, for example, parentage establishment through consent to as-sisted reproduction,224 VAPs, step- and second-parent adoption, equita-ble parenthood doctrines, and (arguably) holding out provisions.225 Animportant and unsettled question relates to whether the consent of justone, or instead all, of the existing legal parents will be required if statesrecognize a mechanism in this category as one through which multi-par-entage can be established. If the consent of all of the existing legal par-ents is required, an additional question arises regarding whether thedefinition of consent will encompass both express and implied consent.Thus far, few legislatures or courts have addressed the consent issue di-rectly. When courts or legislatures have addressed the issue, it has oc-217. Ian Lovett, Measure Opens Door to Three Parents, or Four, N.Y.

While the language of some jurisdictions’ consent to ART statutes only explicitlyrequires the consent of the person seeking to establish parentage over the child conceivedby their spouse or partner, it is generally understood that the consent of the other party—the party undertaking ART to conceive—is also required. See JOSLIN, MINTER &SAKIMURA supra note 49, § 3:4.225. See supra Part II. See also infra note 372 (discussing whether consent of the ex-isting legal parent is required for parentage establishment through holding out provisions).2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 337curred primarily in the contexts of the recognition of multi-parentagethrough adoption and the recognition of multi-parentage or multi-partyparental rights through equitable parenthood doctrines.In the context of multi-parentage establishment through adoption, sofar the statutory and judicial developments (albeit limited) seem to pointin the direction of requiring the express consent of all existing legal par-ents. For example, the language of Nevada’s statute is clear in requiringthe written consent of all existing legal parents to establish multi-parent-age through adoption.226 California’s multi-parentage adoption provisionspecifies that the existing legal parent or parents can maintain their legalparentage after the adoption only “if both the existing parent or parentsand the prospective adoptive parent or parents sign a waiver at any timeprior to the finalization of the adoption.”227 This language seems to indi-cate that creating a multi-parent family through adoption would requirethe express consent of all existing legal parents and all prospective adop-tive parents, and this is how commentators have interpreted the provi-sion.228 In addition, the cases discussed above granting third-parentadoptions in jurisdictions that lack explicit statutory recognition of multi-parentage generally appear to involve situations in which all of the ex-isting legal parents expressly consented to the adoption.229The question of whether all existing legal parents’ consent is requiredfor an additional party to establish parental rights or full legal parentagehas received greater scrutiny in the context of equitable parenthood doc-trines. As discussed above, a common element of equitable parenthooddoctrines is that the child’s existing legal parent consented to, supported,or fostered the formation of the petitioner’s relationship with the child.230It is generally understood that a primary purpose of including this ele-ment in equitable parenthood doctrines is to recognize a fit legal parent’sfundamental constitutional right to make decisions regarding the care,custody, and control of their child and to head off arguments that equita-ble parenthood doctrines violate this fundamental right.231 Specifically, ifa legal parent has chosen to exercise their fundamental parental rights byconsenting to, supporting, or fostering the formation of a parental rela-tionship between another party and the child, the legal parent cannotsubsequently argue that providing that individual with parental rights vio-lates their constitutional rights.232 However, in the vast majority of states226.

Generally, the language of theconsent element in these jurisdictions refers simply to the consent or sup-port of “the legal parent” and does not explicitly address whether theconsent of all existing legal parents is required.238 One potential explana-tion for this is that the legislatures or courts in these jurisdictions werenot contemplating application of the doctrine in situations where a childalready had two fit legal parents.239 Washington, D.C. represents an ex-ception to the general lack of clarity regarding the consent element, spe-cifically requiring as an element of its de facto parentage standard “theagreement of the child’s parent or, if there are [two] parents, bothparents.”240A handful of state appellate courts have directly addressed questionsrelating to whether the state’s equitable parenthood doctrine should beinterpreted to require that all of the existing legal parents consented tothe formation of the relationship between the petitioner and child and, ifso, what form the consent must take. It is important to note, however,that several of these decisions occurred in states where the laws in exis-tence at the time (some of which are still in existence) neither recognizedequitable parents as full legal parents nor provided that a child couldhave more than two legal parents. For example, in K.A.F. v. D.L.M., a2014 New Jersey appellate court decision, the former partner of one ofthe child’s legal parents, who claimed that she had served in a parentalrole to the child for over six years, sought to establish herself as a psycho-logical parent.241 Individuals who qualify as psychological parents underNew Jersey law are entitled to standing to seek custody of the child, andthe requirements for establishing psychological parentage include that“the legal parent must consent to and foster the relationship between thethird party and the child.”242 Both legal parents opposed the petition,arguing that the petitioner could not establish herself as a psychologicalparent since only one of the legal parents had consented to the formationof the parent–child relationship.243 The lower court granted summaryjudgment, holding that because there was no genuine issue of materialfact regarding the contention that one of the legal parents had not con-sented to the relationship, the petitioner’s claim failed as a matter of238.

See id. at 978–79.340 SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 75law.244 The appellate court overturned the lower court’s decision andheld that only one legal parent’s consent was necessary.245While the court acknowledged the fundamental constitutional right offit parents to make decisions about the care, custody, and control of theirchildren, it explained that the right was not absolute and could be over-come by “‘exceptional circumstances’ affecting the welfare of thechild.”246 The court further explained that psychological parenthoodcases fell within the broader category of exceptional circumstances cases,stating that “the transcendent importance of preventing harm to a childweighs more heavily in the balance [than] the fundamental custody rightsof a non-forsaking parent.”247 Regarding the policy implications involved,the court reasoned that to deny recognition of an individual as a child’spsychological parent on the sole basis that one of the legal parents hadnot consented to the relationship would “ignore the ‘psychological harm’a child might suffer because he is deprived of the care of a psychologicalparent.”248 The court also stated that a consent requirement that ren-dered the court “powerless to avert harm to a child through the severanceof the child’s parental bond with a third party” would be contrary to thecourt’s well-established policies of protecting children from harm.249 Thecourt did specify, however, that it was not wholly discounting the impor-tance of one legal parent’s lack of consent.250 It explained that courtscould still consider it as a factor in determining whether the other ele-ments of the psychological parenthood doctrine were satisfied or whetherawarding custody or visitation to the petitioner would further the child’sbest interests.251 But notably, the longer the third party had served in aparental role, the less lack of consent from one of the legal parents wouldfactor into the analysis.252In another 2014 decision, the Court of Appeals of Washington (Divi-sion 3) reached a different conclusion regarding the interpretation of theconsent element of the equitable parenthood doctrine in place at thetime.253 In In re Parentage of J.B.R., the mother’s former partner, whothe eleven-year-old child viewed as her father and had been raised toknow as her father since the age of two, sought to establish de facto par-entage.254 Although the case was decided before Washington statutorilyrecognized de facto parentage or identified it as a mechanism for estab-lishing full legal parentage, under the state’s common law approach a de244.

In terms of the constitutional justifications, the dissent acknowl-edged the fundamental right of fit parents to direct the care, custody, andcontrol of their children, but pointed out that that this right is not abso-lute.293 The dissent argued that the paramount concern in all custodycases is the well-being and interests of the child, and that it is well estab-lished that a child’s interests may outweigh the rights of a parent.294 Ac-cording to the dissent, a standard that allows for the severance of therelationship between the child and someone whom they view as a parentsimply because one of the legal parents did not consent to the relation-ship’s formation fails to sufficiently provide for children’s interests and“inevitably will result in judicial determinations that harm children.”295The dissent further noted that the harm to children resulting from such arule was clearly demonstrated in this case—although the girlfriend hadsatisfied all of the other elements of the de facto parentage standard andthe children viewed her as their mother and desired to live with her, thenon-consenting parent was able to unilaterally sever the relationship.296The dissent also disagreed with the idea that requiring only one par-ent’s consent to the formation of the de facto parent relationship “ne-288.

Thoughts on Resolving the QuestionThe analysis of whether the consent of all existing legal parents shouldbe required for multi-parentage establishment through mechanisms thatin the two-party parentage context require the existing legal parent’s con-sent, as well as the form of any required consent, differs significantly de-pending on the mechanism through which multi-parentage is sought. Theresult is that there is a relatively strong argument that a standard thatdoes not require the express consent of all existing legal parents formulti-parentage establishment through equitable parenthood doctrinesand similar mechanisms that require an established parent–child relation-ship is sound, both constitutionally and as a matter of policy. For theother parentage establishment mechanisms that require the consent of alegal parent, however, it is much clearer that constitutional considerationsmandate, and policy-based considerations support, requiring the expressconsent of all existing legal parents. These parentage establishment mech-anisms include adoption and, if states allow for the recognition of multi-parentage through such mechanisms, VAPs340 and consent to ART334. Id. at 1236 (emphasis added).335. See id.336. Id.337. Id.338. See id. The court also noted that the father had taken certain actions to foster therelationship between the couple and the children that went beyond omissions, such asgranting the couple temporary legal authority and thanking them for raising the children.Id.339. See id. at 1237.340. It is unclear whether U.S. jurisdictions will recognize VAPs as a method throughwhich multi-parentage can occur. The 2017 Uniform Parentage Act, for example, statesthat a VAP is void if the child already has a presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated par-ent (besides the individual who gave birth), which seems to remove the possibility of estab-lishing an individual as a child’s third parent through a VAP.

The requirement in many states’ VAP forms that the partiesattest that the individual seeking to establish parentage is the child’s biological father andthe inability of married individuals to utilize a VAP to establish the parentage of someoneother than their spouse (either at all or unless the spouse is willing to give up their parental2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 349provisions.341a. Equitable Parenthood and Similar Doctrines that Require anEstablished Parent–Child RelationshipThe issue of whether the express consent of all existing legal parentsshould be required for multi-parentage establishment through equitableparenthood doctrines presents an extremely difficult question with strongarguments on each side. However, due to the paramount importance ofchildren’s best interests, it is neither necessary nor desirable for parent-age establishment through equitable parenthood doctrines to require theexpress consent of each of the existing legal parents. A better approach isto either (1) require the consent of only one of the existing legal parents,or (2) require the consent of each existing legal parent, but adopt a broaddefinition of consent that includes implied consent. It is likely that morecourts and state legislatures will adopt the latter approach, which raisesfewer constitutional issues and represents a compromise between requir-ing the consent of only one of the existing parents and requiring the ex-press consent of each existing parent. However, both options arguablyare permissible, both constitutionally and as a matter of policy.While legal parents have a fundamental right to make decisions regard-ing the care, custody, and control of their children, it is well-establishedthat this right is not absolute and must be weighed against competingstate interests.342 For example, in most states, certain categories of thirdparties can be granted custody of a child over the wishes of a child’s legalparent if extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist such that deny-ing the third party custody would harm the child.343 In determining harmto the child, the type of bond and relationship formed between the childand the third party is usually a primary consideration.344Similarly, while the Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville struck downas unconstitutional as applied a visitation statute that allowed the court togrant any party visitation rights at any time if it determined doing so wasin the child’s best interests, the Court stated only that the wishes of thelegal parent must be given “special weight” in visitation determina-rights) also seem to weigh against the likelihood of recognition of multi-parentage throughVAPs. See supra Section II.C.341. It is unclear if in the unpublished Florida decision referenced above, in which acourt allowed a same-sex couple and the sperm provider to be listed on the birth certifi-cate, the court relied on a consent to ART provision for establishing any of the parties’parentage. See supra note 211 and accompanying text. It is possible that the birth motherwas recognized as a legal parent due to having given birth, her spouse based on the maritalpresumption, and the provider based on genetic ties.342. See E.N. v.

Contrary to the assertionof the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in Martin v. MacMahan,351 estab-lishing a third party as a legal parent through an equitable parenthooddoctrine is not akin to the termination of the parental rights of the ex-isting parents.352 On the contrary, as the dissenting opinion in E.N. v.T.R. noted, when multi-parentage is established through an equitableparenthood doctrine, the existing parents remain legal parents with themyriad essential rights and responsibilities that attach to that status.353There is a strong argument that when an individual is able to meet allof the elements necessary to satisfy an equitable parenthood doctrine, itdemonstrates exactly the type of circumstances that are extraordinaryenough to outweigh the legal parent’s fundamental right to make deci-sions regarding the care, custody, and control of their child.354 Satisfac-tion of an equitable parenthood doctrine generally requires showing notonly that the petitioner has, with a legal parent’s support, resided with thechild for a significant period and taken on the responsibilities ofparenthood, but also that the individual has formed a bonded, dependent345.

States could, for example, adoptthe general approach to multi-parentage determinations taken by Califor-nia, Washington, Connecticut, and the 2017 UPA. This approach requiresa showing of detriment to the child before courts will recognize morethan two individuals as a child’s legal parents (regardless of whether themulti-parentage claim arises via an equitable parenthood doctrine or viasome other basis for establishing parentage).359 Alternatively, states thatadopt a best interests—as opposed to detriment—standard for multi-par-entage claims could specify that the objection of an existing parent whodid not expressly consent to the formation of the relationship must begiven special weight in the best interests analysis.360There are also persuasive policy considerations that support a standardthat does not require the express consent of each of the existing legalparents in establishing multi-parentage through satisfaction of equitableparenthood or similar doctrines. While, at least in the context of two fitand involved legal parents, it may seem unjust to allow the spouse orpartner of one of the legal parents to establish parentage without theother legal parent’s express consent, this concern must be weighedagainst the potential harm to the child in failing to recognize the relation-355.

App. Div. 2014) (hold-ing that although both parents’ consent was not required for another party to become thechild’s de facto parent, the lack of consent of one of the parents could be considered by thetrial court in analyzing the best interests of the child).352 SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 75ship. At the end of the day, the fact that the child has formed a bonded,dependent parental relationship with the individual in question remainstrue regardless of whether just one, or both, of the existing legal parentsexpressly consented to the relationship.361 Allowing the fact that one ofthe parents did not expressly consent to, in effect, sever the relationshipbetween the child and a parental figure, even though all of the other ele-ments required to establish equitable parenthood are satisfied, would re-sult in the exact type of harm to the child that equitable parenthooddoctrines were created to avoid.362Moreover, the potential for co-parenting conflicts between the non-consenting parent and the petitioner does not justify requiring both legalparents’ express consent to the formation of the relationship. As an initialmatter, in most states that have adopted multi-parentage laws, a courtcannot recognize more than two legal parents unless it determines eitherthat not recognizing the multi-parentage claim would be detrimental tothe child or that recognizing the multi-parentage claim would further thechild’s best interests.363 The result under either standard is that in situa-tions where the court determines that recognizing multi-parentage wouldnot be beneficial to the child due to the level of conflict among the par-ties, the petitioner would not be recognized as the child’s legal parentdespite having satisfied the elements of the equitable parenthooddoctrine.In addition, the potential for conflict between the parties if the peti-tioner is able to establish parentage pursuant to an equitable parenthooddoctrine is not unique to situations where one of the legal parents has notexpressly consented to the formation of the relationship between the pe-titioner and child. As countless custody cases involving former spouses orpartners demonstrate, conflict frequently arises between parents who, atsome prior point, expressly consented to and fostered each other’s rela-tionship with the child. Furthermore, equitable parenthood doctrines usu-ally (though not always)364 are pursued when a legal parent who fosteredand expressly consented to the relationship between the petitioner andchild subsequently denies the petitioner access to the child following thedemise of the parties’ romantic relationship.365 It is hard to see how thepotential for conflict is lower in situations where both legal parents hadexpressly consented to the relationship between the petitioner and thechild and then subsequently seek to deny the petitioner access to thechild. In fact, as the dissent pointed out in E.N. v. T.R., individuals whodid not previously share an intimate or personal relationship may in some361. E.N. v.

Regardless of whether a custody dispute involves two parents ormultiple parents, courts can, and should, create custody orders that takeinto account the level of conflict among the parents. This may involve, forexample, adopting an order that does not grant all of the parties sharedphysical or legal custody.367As noted above, however, even if it is arguably permissible to adopt arule requiring the consent of only one of the existing legal parents, it isnonetheless important to address the reality that, as prior cases makeclear, a significant number of states likely will require the consent of allexisting legal parents for constitutional (state or federal) or policy-relatedreasons.368 To minimize the potential of harm to the child, it is essentialthat states that require the consent of all existing legal parents for multi-parentage establishment through equitable parenthood doctrines adopt abroad definition of consent. More specifically, these states should adopt adefinition of consent that includes both express and implied consent.With regard to implied consent, the definition should make clear thatconsent can occur through a parent’s acts, omissions, or absences that“create a vacuum in terms of care and nurture [of the child] that is filledby the de facto parent relationship.”369 The definition should furtherspecify that parents who voluntarily have been largely uninvolved in theirchildren’s lives for a substantial period have, through their actions, im-plicitly consented to the formation of a parent-like relationship betweenthe child and another party.States should not adopt the approach to implied consent set forth bythe majority in E.N. v. T.R., which requires that for implied consent tooccur through inaction, the parent must have “knowingly” failed to objectto the formation of the relationship between the petitioner and child.370Such an approach is problematic: it allows the fact that the child has anuninvolved parent who has not made the effort to obtain basic knowledgeabout their child’s life, including who they are living with and who is pro-viding care for them, to prevent legal recognition of the parent–child rela-tionship between the petitioner and child. In contrast, an approach thatequates substantial parental noninvolvement with implied consent will atleast ensure that the fact that a parent has chosen to be uninvolved intheir child’s life for a substantial period of time does not prevent legalrecognition of the relationship between the child and an individual whohas filled the parental gap in the child’s life resulting from the existing366.

See supra note 284 and accompanying text.354 SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 75parent’s lack of involvement.371 Failure to adopt this broader definition ofconsent would lead to unjust results and a greater likelihood of harm tothe child in question.Finally, in terms of other function-based parentage establishmentmechanisms that (arguably) require the express consent of an existing le-gal parent, such as holding out provisions, the question of whether theconsent of all existing legal parents should be required in the multi-par-entage context depends on how such provisions are interpreted.372 If aholding out provision is interpreted to require the existence of a relation-ship that is parental in nature between the petitioner and child, there is astrong argument that a standard that either requires the consent of onlyone legal parent or requires the consent of all existing legal parents butadopts a broad definition of consent is permissible for reasons similar tothose discussed in the context of multi-parentage establishment throughequitable parenthood doctrines. If, however, a state’s holding out provi-sion can be satisfied without proving the existence of a relationship that isparental in nature, the express consent of all existing legal parents shouldbe required for the reasons set forth in the subsection below addressingmulti-parentage claims through mechanisms that do not require an estab-lished parent–child relationship.373b. Adoption and Other Parentage Establishment Mechanisms thatDo Not Require an Established Parent–ChildRelationshipA number of legislatures and courts expressly have recognized adop-tion procedures in which the existing legal parent(s) retain their status aslegal parent(s) as a mechanism through which multi-parentage can occur.In the two-party parentage context, the express consent of the existinglegal parent is required in order for that parent’s spouse or partner toadopt the child through step- or second-parent adoption procedures.When multi-parentage recognition is sought through adoption, the ex-press consent of all existing legal parents should be required. Indeed, allof the statutory and judicial developments discussed above recognizingmulti-parentage through adoption appear to involve situations in which371. See supra note 284 and accompanying text.372. Although the language of most states’ holding out provisions does not explicitlyrequire an existing parent’s consent, in the vast majority of circumstances the holding outcould not occur without the consent of at least one existing legal parent, and thus therequirement of consent arguably can be inferred. See R.M. v. T.A., 182 Cal. Rptr. 3d 836,850 (Cal. Ct. App. 2015) (stating that the holding out provision did not violate the existinglegal parent’s fundamental rights because “by its very nature the presumption will ariseonly if the single parent allows the circumstances to evolve to a point where the person isholding out the child as his or her own and receiving the child into his or her home forpurposes of parental caretaking”); Jeffrey A. Parness, Unconstitutional Parenthood, 104MARQ. L. REV. 183, 190–91 (2020) (“Residency or hold out parentage, as a form of parent-age . . . can be grounded on the actual, apparent, or presumed consents by existing legalparents.”).373. See supra Section IV.A.2.2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 355all of the parties were in agreement regarding the adoption.374 There areboth constitutional and policy-related concerns that support requiring theexpress consent of all existing legal parents in the adoption context.In terms of constitutional concerns, the critical distinction betweenadoption and equitable parenthood doctrines is that an individual doesnot need to have formed a bonded, dependent relationship with the childthat is parental in nature in order to establish parentage through adop-tion.375 As a result, unlike equitable parenthood doctrines, adoption doesnot require the existence of the type of extraordinary circumstances thatoutweigh the fundamental rights of existing legal parents to make deci-sions regarding the care, custody, and control of their children. Regardingpolicy-related considerations, there is a far weaker argument that failureto recognize multi-parentage necessarily will harm the child when themechanism through which the petitioner is seeking to establish parentagedoes not require the existence of a relationship that is parental in naturebetween the petitioner and child. As a result, in this context, the child’sinterests in recognizing the petitioner as a legal parent do not outweighthe concerns regarding fairness to the non-consenting parent and the like-lihood of increased conflict among the child’s parents if the adoption isgranted against the wishes of one of the existing legal parents.376 For thereasons discussed in the subsection above, in situations where one of theexisting legal parents will not consent to the adoption, but extraordinarycircumstances involving an established parent–child relationship betweenthe petitioner and child are present, an equitable parenthood doctrine is amore appropriate mechanism for establishing parentage.If states choose to recognize multi-parentage through the other parent-age establishment mechanisms that require the existing legal parent’s ex-press consent in the two-party parentage context but do not require anestablished parent–child relationship, similar constitutional and policy-based reasons support requiring the express consent of all parties. Thesemechanisms include, for example, consent to ART provisions, VAPs, andany other forms of parentage agreements that the jurisdiction may recog-nize. The arguments against requiring the express consent of all partiesare even weaker in this context than in the adoption context. This is be-cause these methods of parentage establishment generally are under-taken prior to or at the time of the child’s conception or birth, when noneof the parties (aside from the person gestating the child) could yet haveformed a close relationship with the child.It is important to recognize that there are some significant downsidesto requiring the express consent of all existing legal parents for multi-374. See supra notes 227–58 and accompanying text.375. 2 HARALAMBIE, supra note 92, § 14:04.376. See Gupta-Kagan, supra note 159, at 759 (“[L]egislation should require consent ofall parents as a condition of granting a non-exclusive adoption.

Such an approach allows for thepossibility that a legal parent could, out of bitterness, resentment, orsome other reason unrelated to the child’s well-being, single-handedlyprevent the spouse or partner of the other legal parent from establishingparentage, even when the individual has formed a parent-like relation-ship with the child. Not all states that recognize multi-parentage will al-low for parentage establishment to occur through an equitableparenthood doctrine, meaning adoption may be the only option for anindividual who has formed a parental relationship with the child to estab-lish parentage. Moreover, even if all states do eventually recognize multi-parentage through equitable parenthood doctrines, there are still down-sides to requiring individuals who have formed a parental bond with thechild to pursue this mechanism as opposed to adoption. For example, eq-uitable parenthood doctrines generally require an individual to serve in aparental role for a significant amount of time, leaving both the child andthe person serving in a parental role without essential rights and protec-tions in the interim.377 In addition, unlike adoption procedures, equitableparenthood claims usually are not pursued unless and until the relation-ship the petitioner shared with one of the child’s legal parents has brokendown.378 The result is that there will be a substantial period of time inwhich the child and petitioner lack essential rights and protections thatwould have attached to their relationship much earlier if adoption hadbeen an option.These issues, however, can be ameliorated to a significant extentthrough solutions that do not involve infringing on the non-consentingparent’s fundamental constitutional rights. For example, not only shouldstates that have not yet done so enact equitable parenthood doctrines forparentage establishment, states also should make clear that these mecha-nisms are available even when the relationship shared between the peti-tioner and the legal parent(s) is intact. Other steps that states could taketo protect the relationship between a child and someone they view as aparent include adopting standards granting standing to seek custody andvisitation to individuals who have formed a parent-like relationship withthe child.B. THE NUMBER OF PARENTS1. The QuestionWhen the subject of multi-parentage is broached, usually one of thefirst questions that arises is whether there will be any limit set on howmany individuals can establish themselves as a child’s legal parents. Thereare strong arguments both for and against establishing a firm limit on thenumber of individuals who can establish legal parentage. On the onehand, many commentators, including advocates in favor of multi-parent-377. See supra Section II.H.378. See generally Feinberg, supra note 106.2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 357age recognition, have expressed concern that allowing too many individu-als to attain legal parentage will be harmful to children.379 One aspect ofthis concern focuses on the harm to children that can come from having“too many cooks in the kitchen.”380 The greater the number of individu-als who are tasked with the wide variety of decisions, small and big, thatparents must make about raising their children, the higher the likelihoodthat disagreements will arise among the child’s parents.381 This can leadto a situation in which “no parent can effectively accomplish his or hertask without being undercut by someone else.”382 It also could result ingreater state intervention in children’s lives and more frequent litigationregarding custody, visitation, and child support—occurrences that arewidely considered to be harmful to children’s well-being.383 Moreover,regardless of whether the disputes end up in court, children often sufferwhen their parents’ relationship is marked by frequent disagreements andcontentiousness regarding co-parenting decisions.384Another aspect of the concerns about a child having too many legalparents is that the more parents a child has, the more likely it is that thechild will need to split their time among multiple households. This canlead to the child experiencing feelings of instability, insecurity, and lackof belonging.385 It also may make it harder for the child to form strongbonds with each of their parents.386 A related fear is that “fractured fam-ily units resulting from break-ups would be all the more painful for chil-dren if they have three or four parents who they may feel are owed theirallegiance—a child might feel caught not just between two worlds, butbetween three or four.”387 Finally, some commentators have argued thatsetting a cap is necessary to ensure that the law is not facilitating parent-age establishment among individuals in cults or cult-like settings.388On the other hand, capping how many legal parents a child can have ata certain number may not be the best way to address these concerns.Identifying one number as the absolute maximum number of legal par-379.

Thus, some commentators argue that the betterapproach is to make determinations regarding how many legal parents achild can have based on that specific child’s interests, the relationshipamong the potential parents, and the overall circumstances of the familyin question.3902. Thoughts on Resolving the QuestionThus far, none of the statutes providing for multi-parentage include acap on the number of legal parents, and this is the better approach.391The number of legal parents a child should have depends on the uniquecharacteristics of the family in question. For some families, the number ofparents should be capped at two. For others, capping the number at threewill make the most sense. For yet others, the appropriate number will befour or more. It is unnecessary for states to choose one number as theabsolute maximum. There are better, less arbitrary ways of ensuring thatthe law does not recognize a multi-parentage familial structure thatwould be contrary to the well-being of the particular child in question. Infact, there are already several important aspects of existing laws gov-erning multi-parentage that have the effect of limiting the number of le-gal parents a child can have without setting forth an arbitrary numericalcap.In the states that recognize multi-parentage, a party seeking to estab-lish parentage of a child who already has two parents must qualify as alegal parent pursuant to one of the parentage establishment mechanismsrecognized in the two-party parentage context.392 Not only that, but themechanism also must be one through which multi-parentage can be es-tablished in the jurisdiction.393 A jurisdiction may only recognize certainmechanisms as available for multi-parentage establishment, and themechanisms that are available may have strict requirements that few peo-ple would be able to satisfy.394 Thus, even a person who has a basis for389. See Appleton, supra note 4, at 68 (“A one-size-fits-all rule . . . strikes me as tooblunt to constitute a child-centered rule about how many legal parents a particular childmay have. . . .

Id.; Gatos, supra note 386, at 216 (“By focusing on the role of the parties in afamily of consent, and the relationships between the parents, the law does not have todetermine a maximum number of parents a child may have.”).391.

App. Div. 2014) (responding tothe fear that a child could have too many legal parents pursuant to the psychological par-entage doctrine by noting the significant difficulty of satisfying the doctrine).2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 359parentage establishment that would be recognized in the two-party par-entage context may not have a basis for establishing parentage that isrecognized in the multi-parentage context.395In addition, establishing multi-parentage requires judicial approval,and even when an individual can prove that they have a basis for estab-lishing parentage that the jurisdiction recognizes as one through whichmulti-parentage can occur, there is often an additional substantive deter-mination that a court must make before recognizing multi-parentage.396This additional step makes multi-parentage establishment even more dif-ficult. For example, under the approaches of California, Washington,Connecticut, and the 2017 UPA, a court cannot recognize multi-parent-age unless “the court finds that recognizing only two parents would bedetrimental to the child.”397 Vermont has adopted a best interests—asopposed to detriment—standard for the additional substantive determi-nation.398 These types of safeguards reduce significantly the risk that aharmful number of people will be able to establish themselves as a child’slegal parents.Finally, even if in a later custody or visitation dispute between the par-ents it turns out that there are, in fact, “too many cooks in the kitchen,”the court would have the discretion to structure an order governing cus-tody and visitation in a manner that protected the child from harm. Whilein some jurisdictions there are presumptions in favor of awarding jointlegal and physical custody among the child’s legal parents, all jurisdictionsrecognize that the best interests of the child is the paramount concern incustody determinations and that joint custody should not be orderedwhere it would be contrary to the child’s best interests.399 Furthermore,while fit legal parents generally have a right to visitation, a court maydeny a parent visitation if it determines that such visitation would be det-rimental to the child.400 As a number of scholars persuasively have advo-cated, states should make clear that these well-established principlescarry over to the multi-parentage context, and that courts do not have toprovide each parent with custody or visitation rights where it would becontrary to the child’s best interests.401 California law provides a helpful395. For example, Delaware provides for multi-parentage only through satisfaction ofits de facto parentage doctrine, and Louisiana recognizes multi-parentage only when achild is born to a different-sex married couple and the husband is not the child’s biologicalfather. See supra Section III.B.1. In addition, the 2017 UPA provides that a VAP is void ifthe child already has a second presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent, which pre-sumably excludes VAPs as a method through which multi-parentage can be established.See UNIF.

[t]he court may order thatnot all parents share legal or physical custody of the child if the courtfinds that it would not be in the best interest of the child.”402 Overall, acap on the number of legal parents is not necessary—there are a numberof steps states can take to protect children from the risk of harm relatedto having too many legal parents while still respecting the rich diversity infamily structures that exists today.C. RESPECTING LGBTQ+ FAMILIES1. The QuestionThe final question that this Article will address regarding the bounda-ries of multi-parentage is how to structure multi-parentage laws in a waythat minimizes the risk of courts using such laws to impose a hetero- andbio-normative family structure on LGBTQ+ families. A number of schol-ars have expressed concerns about the potential for hetero- and bio-nor-mative biases to influence judges’ decisions in the multi-parentagecontext.403 Indeed, at least one multi-parentage advocate has explicitlyidentified the potential of “filling the gap of the missing ‘gender’” in fam-ilies headed by same-sex parents as a reason for why states should recog-nize multi-parentage.404One common scenario in which this issue may be particularly likely toarise involves LGBTQ+ couples who utilize known gamete providers toconceive their children. LGBTQ+ couples may choose to obtain gametesfrom a known—as opposed to anonymous—provider for various reasons.These reasons may include, “concern for the future medical and emo-tional needs of the child,” a higher comfort level conceiving with the ga-metes of someone the couple knows, or cost-related considerations.405 Inmany cases, while the couple intends for the known gamete provider tohave some level of contact with the child, they do not intend for the pro-vider to play a parental role (i.e., they do not intend to create a multi-parentage family structure).406 Over the years, there have been a numberof cases in which a known sperm provider seeks to establish parentageagainst the wishes of a same-sex couple, and the parties dispute whetherthe sperm provider should be considered a donor with no parental rights402.

As an ini-tial matter, it is not clear in all states that donor non-paternity lawsextend to known donors.411 Moreover, even if a state’s donor non-pater-nity law extends to known donors, it may not apply if the parties failed tocomply with the law’s formal requirements.412 For example, a commonrequirement of donor non-paternity laws is that the conception involvedthe assistance of a physician413 or medical technology,414 which excludessituations involving at-home inseminations or conceptions that occur viasexual intercourse.415 In addition, the language of some donor non-pater-nity laws refers only to conceptions that occur via insemination, leaving itunclear whether the law applies to conceptions that occur via other formsof assisted reproduction.416 In a few jurisdictions, the language of the do-nor non-paternity law refers only to conceptions by married women.417Donor non-paternity laws also may not prevent a sperm provider fromestablishing parentage where he has played a role in the child’s life afterbirth, making the parties’ intent less clear,418 or where he asserts a claim407.

While there is still progress to be made,particularly in the context of unmarried same-sex couples, today same-sex couples have more avenues available for establishing both membersas their child’s legal parents than ever before.423 This is especially true ofmarried same-sex couples, who can establish parentage at the time of thechild’s birth through a variety of mechanisms including, inter alia, themarital presumption and spousal consent to ART provisions.424 Alongwith broader legal rights and protections for LGBTQ+ individuals andfamilies has come significantly greater societal respect for the integrity ofsuch families.425 These developments have changed the analysis in casesinvolving parentage disputes between same-sex couples and known gam-ete providers.In recent years, a number of courts have addressed the claims of knownsperm providers in situations in which the child was conceived via non-sexual means and born to a member of a married same-sex couple.

These rea-sons include: (1) that a petitioner’s genetic ties to a child, standing alone,was not a basis for rebutting the marital presumption when the child wasconceived through assisted reproduction and born to a married same-sexcouple;427 (2) that while both the marital presumption and the genetictesting presumption applied in the case, the marital presumption con-trolled because it was based on weightier considerations of policy andlogic in situations where the married same-sex couple intended to raisethe child;428 (3) that the petitioner’s claim was barred by equitable estop-pel because he had “led [the same-sex couple] to reasonably believe thathe would not assert—and had no interest in acquiring—any parentalrights;”429 (4) that allowing the petitioner’s claim to proceed would becontrary to the best interests of a child who considered the same-sexcouple to be her parents;430 and (5) that the petitioner had not satisfiedthe jurisdiction’s standing requirement for putative fathers who seek torebut the marital presumption because he had not formed a substantialrelationship with the child.431 In each of the cases, the court noted thatbecause it would disrupt the relationship the child shared with someonethey viewed as a parent as well as the child’s core understanding of theirfamily, granting the sperm provider legal parentage would result in signif-icant harm to the child.432While these cases recognizing the integrity of families headed byLGBTQ+ parents have represented welcome developments for such fam-ilies, there is a fear that multi-parentage will undo the progress that hasoccurred. More specifically, there is a fear that if a court has the power torecognize more than two legal parents, it will be more likely to recognizea known sperm provider as a legal parent even if he would have beenunsuccessful in displacing the spouse or partner of the person who gavebirth as the child’s second legal parent in the two-party parentage con-text. While the desire to provide the child with a parent who both sharesgenetic ties with the child and fills in the “missing gender” may no longer426. See, e.g., Doherty v.

For example, a court maybe less strict in its analysis of whether the petitioner has satisfied one ofthe grounds for establishing parentage recognized in the jurisdiction, in-cluding erring on the side of allowing the petitioner to assert genetics-based grounds when there is a dispute regarding the application of a do-nor non-paternity law. Discrimination against LGBTQ+ couples also mayarise in the final part of the multi-parentage analysis, when the court de-termines whether recognizing multi-parentage under the circumstanceswould promote the child’s best interests or not recognizing multi-parent-age would be detrimental to the child. A court could potentially rely onthe fact of the missing gender among the child’s existing legal parents orthe sperm provider’s biological ties to the child to determine that the bestinterests or detriment standard is satisfied.If a jurisdiction’s recognition of multi-parentage leads to known spermproviders being able to establish parentage in situations in which theirclaims otherwise would be denied, it would lead to harm and instabilityfor LGBTQ+ couples who conceived their children with the intent to bethe child’s sole legal parents. As one court explained, allowing spermproviders to obtain parentage in these circumstances “exposes childrenborn into same-gender marriages to instability for no justifiable reasonother than to provide a father-figure for children who already have twoparents.”433 As the court correctly observed, “This would be indefen-sible . . . . [I]t would undermine the ‘compelling public policy of protect-ing children conceived via [assisted reproduction].’”434 While protectingfamilies headed by LGBTQ+ parents from potential judicial bias is acomplex undertaking, there are a number of steps states could take tominimize the effects of such bias.2. Thoughts on Resolving the QuestionIt is important to note that while the concerns above are warranted andmust be addressed, in some situations the recognition of multi-parentageactually may benefit LGBTQ+ couples by allowing both members to ob-tain parentage in situations where only one of the members otherwisewould have been able to do so.435 For example, courts may be less likelyto identify the same-sex spouse or partner of the individual who gavebirth as the child’s second parent over the person whose sperm was usedto conceive the child when the conception occurred through sexual433. Christopher YY., 69 N.Y.S.3d at 898–99.434. Id. at 899.435. Cahn & Carbone, supra note 170, at 404.2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 365means.436 The New York case Q.M. v. B.C. is illustrative.437 There, duringa period of separation, one member of a married same-sex couple con-ceived a child through sexual intercourse with a third party.438 The al-leged biological father sought to establish paternity, and the individualwho gave birth and her spouse sought to have the spouse recognized asthe child’s legal parent.439 When confronted with competing claims ofparentage from the alleged biological father (on genetics-based grounds)and the spouse (based on the marital presumption), the court determinedthat the spouse was not the child’s legal parent and, thus, that the allegedbiological father could proceed with his claim to establish legal parentagebased on genetic ties to the child.440The court distinguished this case, in which conception occurred via sex-ual intercourse, from cases in which both members of a married same-sexcouple consented to one member conceiving a child through assisted re-production using anonymous donor sperm.441 While in the latter situationthe consent to assisted reproduction statute would provide parentage tothe spouse, in the case at hand, because the conception occurred via sex-ual intercourse, the spouse was seeking to establish parentage pursuant tothe marital presumption.442 The court explained that it was not requiredto recognize the same-sex spouse of an individual who conceives a childvia sexual intercourse with a third party as the child’s legal parent pursu-ant to the marital presumption because the state’s Marriage Equality Act“does not require the court to ignore the obvious biological differencesbetween husbands and wives . . . [and] neither spouse in a same-sex fe-male couple can father a child.”443 If multi-parentage had been an option,however, the court may have been more likely to also recognize thespouse as a legal parent.444 Importantly, the steps proposed below, whichare aimed at helping to protect LGBTQ+ parents from having multi-par-entage imposed on them in inappropriate circumstances, would be un-likely to dissuade courts from recognizing multi-parentage in appropriatecircumstances where it would benefit LGBTQ+ parents.An initial step that states should take is to avoid adopting a legalframework governing multi-parentage that reinforces hetero- and bio-normativity. The approach taken in Canada’s Uniform Child Status Act is436. Compare Q.M. v. B.C., 995 N.Y.S.2d 470, 476 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. 2014) (holding thatthe biological father could establish paternity of a child conceived through sexual inter-course and born during a same-sex marriage), with McNair v. Shannon, No. CV 136017755,2014 WL 1345353, at *3 (Conn. Super. Ct. Mar. 12, 2014) (denying the putative fatherstanding to establish paternity of a child conceived through sexual intercourse and bornduring a same-sex marriage where the putative father had not formed a relationship withthe child and the child was being raised in a stable family unit).437. See Q.M., 995 N.Y.S.2d at 470.438. See id. at 472.439. See id. at 471.440. See id. at 476.441. See id. at 474.442. See id.443. Id.444. Cahn & Carbone, supra note 170, at 404.366 SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 75an example of the type of multi-parentage framework that states shouldavoid. The Act provides for the recognition of multi-parentage only whenthere is a preconception agreement executed by the individual who willgestate the child, their spouse or common law partner, “and another per-son(s) who intend(s) to provide their human reproductive material.”445 Inthe vast majority of cases, the type of agreement recognized by the Actwill involve a female same-sex couple (one of whom will gestate thechild) and a male sperm provider.446 The province of British Columbiahas adopted a similar approach, limiting multi-parentage recognition topreconception agreements between (1) intended parents and the “birthmother,” or (2) the birth mother, the birth mother’s spouse or partner,and “a donor.”447 As one scholar noted, the practical effect of this type ofapproach is that “the only kind of . . . family capable of being created isone in which a child being raised by same-sex parents will acquire a thirdlegal parent who is both the child’s other biological progenitor as well asan individual of the opposite sex.”448The type of approach reflected in Canada’s Uniform Child Status Actand British Columbia’s multi-parentage provision sends the message thatthe only purpose of multi-parentage is to allow children to have a legallyrecognized relationship with individuals with whom they share biologicalties; individuals who, in most cases, will “fill in the gap of the missinggender.”449 States should seek to avoid sending this message by structur-ing their multi-parentage laws in a way that does not privilege hetero-and bio-normativity. More specifically, states’ multi-parentage lawsshould recognize that individuals seeking to establish legal parentage of achild who already has two legal parents can utilize mechanisms that donot require the existence of genetic ties. These mechanisms may include,for example, adoption, equitable parenthood doctrines, holding out pro-visions, VAPs, and consent to ART provisions.Another important step for states to take in this context is to makeclear both that donor non-paternity laws extend to known donors andthat an individual who is a donor cannot establish parentage on genetics-based grounds. The law should specify that a donor can establish parent-age only if, without consideration of their genetic ties to the child, theyare able to satisfy one of the other grounds for parentage establishment.This will help to ensure that a donor is not deemed a legal parent againsta LGBTQ+ couple’s wishes simply because the couple chose a knowndonor or allowed the donor to have some degree of contact with thechild.445.

L. REV. 565, 568 (2014).449. See supra note 404 and accompanying text.2022] Boundaries of Multi-Parentage 367Finally, states’ multi-parentage provisions should identify the types ofconsiderations that the court should and should not weigh in the finalstep of the multi-parentage analysis. This part of the analysis, dependingon the state, requires the court to determine either that the failure torecognize multi-parentage would be detrimental to the child or that rec-ognition of multi-parentage would promote the child’s best interests.There are a number of important steps that states could take in this re-gard. As an initial matter, states could follow the approach of Californiacourts in requiring that, in order to satisfy the detriment or best interestsanalysis, an individual who is seeking to establish parentage of a childwho already has two existing legal parents in a contested case must provethat they share a relationship with the child that is parental in nature.450This is another step that would help ensure that a LGBTQ+ couple whosimply allows their child to have some contact with a known donor doesnot risk having a third parent imposed on their family.The law also should provide that considerations relating to the gendersof the existing legal parents and the individual seeking to establish par-entage are improper in the detriment or best interests analysis. Explicitlyexcluding gender-based considerations would not be outside the norm forstandards governing best interests determinations. In the custody realm,most states already specify that in considering the custody arrangementthat would promote the child’s best interests, the court may not give pref-erence to a parent based upon their gender.451 States should also specify,as California courts have, that the existence of biological ties between thepetitioner and child is not, in and of itself, sufficient to support a findingthat denying the multi-parentage claim would be detrimental to thechild.452 As one court explained, “the fact that [a child’s parents] are bothmothers does not warrant a finding that the child has an interest in know-ing the identity of, or having a legal or familial relationship with, the manwho donated sperm that enabled the mother’s conception.”453 WhileLGBTQ+ families unfortunately may still sometimes encounter judicialbias, the proposed steps will help to minimize the risk that such bias willbe determinative of the result in multi-parentage cases.V. CONCLUSIONLegal recognition of multi-parentage is increasing at an impressivepace in the United States. As a result, the time has come to carefullyconsider how to structure the laws that will establish the boundaries ofmulti-parentage recognition. Important questions remain regarding, inter450.

    "abstract": "Multi-parentage has arrived. In recent years, a growing number of courts and legislatures have recognized that a child may have more than two legal parents. A number of significant societal, medical, and legal developments have contributed to the trend toward multi-parentage recognition. The traditional family structure of a married different-sex couple and their biological children currently represents only a minority of U.S. families. Stepparents, non-marital partners of legal parents, and extended family members often play a significant role in children’s lives, and it has become increasingly common for same-sex couples to welcome children into their families. In addition, advancements in assisted reproductive technology have made it possible for a greater number of parties to play a role in a child’s conception. At the same time, the law has expanded both the categories of individuals who are eligible to establish parentage and the mechanisms through which parentage can be established. While the trend in favor of multi-parentage recognition is clear, the boundaries of multi-parentage remain largely unsettled. It is imperative that in drafting their multi-parentage laws, states carefully consider how to address a number of important questions. These questions include, for example, whether each of the child’s existing legal parents must consent to the establishment of multi-parentage, what (if any) cap should be set on the number of individuals who can establish legal parentage, and how to avoid imposing a hetero- and bionormative family structure on LGBTQ+ families. After providing a detailed analysis of the complex issues involved in each of these questions, the Article sets forth a number of proposals regarding how states should address these critical questions within their multi-parentage laws",
