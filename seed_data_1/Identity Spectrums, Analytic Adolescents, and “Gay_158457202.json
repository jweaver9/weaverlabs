Applying a feminist narrative analysis \nto examine the qualitative data, I propose a methodological research shift where the \nvoices of youth are valued as content experts; an artistic shift that moves content-creation \naway from a top down traditional media model and towards a youth-centered new media \napproach for art making; an aesthetic shift away from over-used stereotypes, tropes, and \nstale representations and instead innovate to represent intersectional, spectrum-based \ndiversity of the LGBTQ+ experience. \nThis qualitative research study utilizes questionnaires, focus groups, and case \nstudy interviews, to engage adolescent perceptions of queer narratives.  The youth, \nranging in ages from 15 to 18 years old and living in the Phoenix, Arizona metro area, \nexplore and examine LGBTQ+ themes, characters, plots in traditional and new media.   \n My dissertation examines youth interactions with queer narratives through three \nchapters.  These address themes of: character, identity, and representation; plot and the \nsearch for accuracy; and the symbiotic exchange between narrative and community.  \nThroughout the dissertation, young people analyze narratives, reflect on their own lives, \nand envision the future of youth queer narrative.  The youth describe a move away from \ntraditional media and towards new media platforms with user-created content, social \nnetwork interaction, and the sharing of common experiences with peers.  Finally, I \n  \n \nii \nexamine the implications of both the research findings and the methodology on the future \nof youth-engaged qualitative research, as well as the performing arts. \n \n  \n  \n

I distinctly remember being like, \"Oh, that girl's pretty.  Oh, I \nlike her outfit,\" and I'd get flustered around girls but I thought it was just because, \nI don’t know, I just didn’t realize I was gay. \n \nSo around then, I remember watching Orange is the New Black and there was a \ncharacter who was – I think it was Piper, actually…I remember her being like \nvery feminine and pretty and I remember her talking about being gay or being bi \nor basically being attracted to women…I remember just like a moment of clarity, \nlike the heavens opened up and I was like “I'm gay.” It's not that I just think girls \nare pretty. I'm attracted to girls. I've never been attracted to men. \n \nBecause of media, I feel like I thought of lesbians as such a stereotype being they \nhad to be butch, they had to have short hair, they had to be into cars or whatever. \nBut also because of media, that kind of crushed that view I had in my head and \ntold me more about myself (Penelope 2017). \n \nPenelope is an example of how young people learn more about themselves through queer \nmedia narratives that surround youth.  My research study examines youth queer \nnarratives through having direct conversations with adolescents, valuing their \nperspectives, and exploring the narrative landscapes together.   \nI conduct my research with young people during a particularly transformative \nmoment in United States history.  First, the queer population is growing, as seen in a \nGallup report indicating that, in 2016, 10 million people (4.1% of the US population) \nidentify as LGBTQ+, an increase of 1.75 million since 2012.  It is estimated that 7.3% of \nall millennials identify as LGBT which is almost double Generation X (3.2%), roughly \ntriple the baby boomers (2.4%), and five times as many traditionalists, those born before \n1945 (1.4%) (Gates 2017).  A Pew Research Center study indicated that 87% of surveyed \n  \n \n2 \nadults know someone who is gay or lesbian, while 30% know someone who is \ntransgender (Where the Public Stands 2016).  As more people identify as queer, it stands \nto reason that more narrative content will emerge in the media.   \nThe teenagers of 2018 were born during the culture wars of the early 2000s and \nlearned to walk as queer communities felt the wave of anti-same-sex marriage state-ballot \ninitiatives passed in the 2002 election.  When contemporary teenagers entered junior \nhigh, President Obama advanced equal rights through anti-discrimination executive \norders, supporting pro-LGBTQ+ legislation, and the Supreme Court ruled same-sex \nmarriage legal in the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case.  Attitudes towards LGBTQ+ issues \nshifted from 1997 to 2015 as evidenced in a 2015 Pew Research Center study which \nfound that 63% of US Americans “say homosexuality should be accepted by society,” up \nfrom 46% in 1994 (Gao 2015).  Throughout this cultural shift, children have been \nwatching television, reading books, exploring the rapidly expanding Internet and social \nmedia universe.  These media sources contain more stories of queer individuals, same-sex \ncouples, out LGBTQ+ characters, and overall LGBTQ+ representations (Chung 2007; \nFisher et al. 2004; Kelso 2015).  I wanted to speak with young people like Penelope, as \nwitnesses to this journey, about queer character constructions and narratives with youth \nperspective front and center. \nResearch Question \nBuilding from a place of cultural curiosity, I have one primary research question \nwith several supporting questions that focus on the complex relationship between \n  \n \n3 \nnarrative, youth and identity development as well as the established and developing \nforms of media. \nResearch Question: How do young people engage, interpret, and respond to queer \nnarratives?   \nRelated Research Questions: \n• Where do young people find queer narratives? \n• How do social relationships and social networks affect narrative interaction and \ninterpretation? \n• How are youth identities affected by narratives? \n• How are queer narratives constructed in traditional media and new media? \n• How do youth see themselves and their own lives in relation to queer narratives? \n• How are queer narrative storylines understood to represent or not represent youth \nrealities?  What is realistic or accurate to young people? \n• Where do young people learn about queerness? \n• What do young people wish to see in traditional media youth queer narratives? \nEntering the Discourse Community \n To begin I want to lay the groundwork and place myself in the larger discourse \ncommunity.  As my study focuses on youth queer narratives, I examine each before \nshifting to looking at the media and elaborating on my research approach and \nmethodology. \nDefining Youth \nFor the purposes of my study, I define youth as those from birth through the \n  \n \n4 \napproximate age of 18 years old.  As youth in the United States are partially characterized \nby the compulsory K-12 education system, I choose to work within that structure.  While \nyounger youth, like upper elementary or middle school students, would probably benefit \nfrom a discussion about identity construction (as they are wrestling with puberty and their \nown personal identities), this age group tends to be more protected by the gate-keepers \n(parents and school administration) than older youth.  Access to older youth is generally \neasier as their identities are more closely aligned to the stages of adulthood—not as in \nneed of gate-keeper protection.  The research population is largely limited by researcher \naccess.  Youth structurally transition when they turn 18.  They can serve in the military, \nvote, sign themselves out of school, and are often legally treated as adults.  The \ngovernment grants legal rights to 18-year-old individuals, marking the end of youth-ness \nand the beginning of adulthood.  Rather than deal with academic distinctions or medical \nestimations of the human brain’s full development, I choose to deal with the systems and \nstructures that define youth and adulthood.  US American youth endure these constructs, \nso I choose to utilize this working definition.   \nYouth are not passive receptacles, unwillingly assaulted by media narratives.  In \nthe United States, youth are active consumers, accepting and rejecting, consuming and \nproducing, receiving and transmitting the ideologies, constructions, and decisions \npresented.  Youth filter the messages through interactions with other people’s narratives \nof their own identity journeys.  I next examine the active relationship and the \naccepting/rejecting narrative filtering present in young people.   \nWorking with youth, instead of on youth, is important because they have their \n  \n \n5 \nown unique points of view and experiences.  Rather than assume the narratives they \nconsume or their reactions to these constructs, I speak with them directly.  Youth, often \nviewed as on the journey to adulthood, should be respected as unique human beings.  \nScholars have explored the tension between youth as becoming/being (Qvotrup 2011; \nJames 2011; Sykes 2011), and I choose to treat youth as humans, not solely as products in \ndevelopment.  In order to uncover/discover youth engagement with queer narratives and \ncharacters, my research puts youth front and center.  I want to ensure young people and \ntheir unique insights are respected throughout the research process.  I could conduct this \nresearch from an adult-outsider position and predict what youth might watch or think and, \ntherefore, speaking for youth. However, I cannot honor youth as human beings and treat \ntheir voices as less important.  While youth develop physically, emotionally, and socially \nduring their teenage years, they still should be treated as independent humans with their \nown unique perspectives.   \nWhen I examine the current body of research about queer youth media, some \nresearchers spoke with young people under the age of 18 (Snapp et al. 2015; Bond 2015; \nHarper and Bruce 2016).  Other researchers focused on adult researcher interpretations \nand queer readings of youth-focused media (Raley and Lucas 2006). Those who did, \nspoke to 18 to 22-year olds in university or support group settings.  These studies covered \nthe trans youth experience (McInroy and Craig 2015), the effect of media on youth \nresiliency (Craig et al. 2015), and identity formation from Glee (Meyer and Wood 2013).  \nA similar study used surveys and focus groups with adults to identity LGBTQ+ role \nmodels for the coming-out process, dealing with bullying, etc.  (Gomillion and Giuliano \n  \n \n6 \n2011).  Few studies interview young people under the age of 18 and when they do, they \nfocus exclusively on queer youth perceptions of queer media in terms of identity \nformation, the coming out process, and bullying.  Few ask non-queer youth about queer \nrepresentations nor youth narrative constructions or interpretations.  This hole in the \nresearch data is what my study seeks to address. \nDefining Queer \nAs “queer” has been reclaimed by young people, as well as the larger discourse \ncommunity, I use “queer” as a collective term to include the panoply of non-normative \ngender, sexual, and affectual identities.  The term itself has been reclaimed by the \nLGBTQ+ community and in particular by the scholarly field, as evidenced in the rise of \nqueer studies (De Lauretis 1991; Jagose 1996; Halperin 2003).  This reclamation returns \nthe power of the word to the subordinated and oppressed people.  As Kimberle Crenshaw \nstates,  \nSubordinated people can and do participate, sometimes even subverting the \nnaming process in empowering ways. One need only think about the historical \nsubversion of the category ‘Black’ or the current transformation of ‘queer’ to \nunderstand that categorization is not a one-way street. Clearly, there is unequal \npower, but there is nonetheless some degree of agency that people can and do \nexert in the politics of naming.  And it is important to note that identity continues \nto be a site of resistance for members of different subordinated groups (Crenshaw \n1991, 1297). \n \nWhile the term may not be preferred by all in the LGBTQ+ community due to its \ncheckered past, the queer theorists of the late 20th century like Teresa De Lauretis (1991) \nand Annamarie Jagose (1996), the young people in this study in 2017, have taken the \nword back.  As James Sears states, “I celebrate queer because our childhoods were \npervaded by those who brandished the word in the staccato repartee of classmates in \n  \n \n7 \ninsults hurled into the radio waves, and in hellfire condemnation from pulpits” (Sears \n1999, 4).  Scholars, activists, artists, and youth can mobilize queerness to challenge the \nforces that have worked against the queer community in the past. \nHaving a queer identity or identifying queerly means stepping away from the \nheteronormative way of seeing oneself.  Instead of existing in the heterosexual-only \nlandscape, queer individuals embrace a broader affectual, sexual, and identity definition. \nQueer  \nchallenged the normalizing mechanisms of state power to name its sexual \nsubjects: male or female, married or single, heterosexual or homosexual, natural \nor perverse.  Given its commitment to interrogating the social processes that not \nonly produced and recognized but also normalized and sustained identity, the \npolitical promise of the term resided specifically in its broad critique of multiple \nsocial antagonisms, including race, gender, class, nationality, and religion, in \naddition to sexuality. (Eng, Halberstam, and Muñoz 2005, 1) \n \nQueer serves as a reclamation of power to step outside of the normalized or standardized \ndefinitions of sexuality, gender, relationships and identities.  Queer identity is non-\nnormative and, within the working definition of queer, tension exists between trying to \ndefine the term while also acknowledging it is without a fixed point. \nThat queerness remains open to a continuous critique of its exclusionary \noperations has always been one of the field’s key theoretical and political \npromises.  What might be called the ‘subjectless’ critique of queer studies \ndisallows any positing of a proper subject of or object for the field by insisting \nthat queer has no fixed political referent. (Eng, Halberstam, and Muñoz 2005, 3)  \n \nQueer functions as a way to describe a break from the heteronormative “normal.”  \nEssentially, when people construct a societal norm, the violation or challenging of that \nnorm can fall under the nebulous term queer.  Queer also works to break fixed definitions \nand identity structures.  “As presently constituted, queer seeks to disrupt the discrete, \n  \n \n8 \nfixed locations of identity by understanding sexuality and its meanings not as a priori or \ngiven but as constructed, contingent, fashioned and refashioned, and relational” (Talburt \n2000, 3).  As Susan Talburt indicates, identity, sexuality, gender, are all constructed and \nrelational, therefore they can be deconstructed and explored in relation to others.  \nHowever, even queerness can settle into an established definition and fixed identity.  The \nqueer label takes on the norms of being queer and has lost part of its disruptive origin.   \nSecond, queer can functions as a verb or an action.  Queer has the power to \ndestabilize or challenge.  “Queer has been said not to be a noun, for nouns stabilize in \nspace and time, but an adjective that cuts across identities, subjectivities, and \ncommunities” (Talburt 2000, 4-5).  When applying this verb to our work as scholars or as \npractitioners, the act of queering or applying queer theory allows us to re-examine our \nassumptions and to frame the field differently.  Queer becomes a functional lens to reflect \non one’s work.  The term queer shifts and can take on multiple meanings.  As Judith \nButler states,  \nIf the term ‘queer’ is to be a site of collective contestation, the point of departure \nfor a set of historical reflections and future imaginings, it will have to remain that \nwhich is...never fully owned, but always and only redeployed, twisted, queered \nfrom a prior usage and in the direction of urgent and expanding political purposes. \n(Butler 1993, 228)  \n \nButler indicates that this word constantly shifts and grows in order to stay queer.  Once it \nfalls into the normative space, it needs to be broken out again.  As queer nears a codified \nset of identities, it can be challenged by its gerund (verb) form.    \nBefore moving further, I must center an operational definition.  I use “queer” as a \ncollective term to include the panoply of non-heteronormative gender and sexual \n  \n \n9 \nidentities.  The term itself has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community and in \nparticular by the scholarly field, as evidenced in the rise of queer studies.  Additionally, \nthroughout the dissertation, I use the acronym LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, queer, and a plus sign to include other identity-communities) as a connection \nto the larger non-normative community.  I use no other collective terminology in the \ndissertation. \nDefining Narrative \nGenerally defined, narratives are the stories humans tell each other and are \ncomposed of character, plot, and action.  However, as Marie-Laure Ryan states in her \narticle, “Towards a Definition of Narrative,” narrative definitions should not depend too \nstrongly on implicit elements.  She posits that narrative should include the less \nclassifiable pieces that relate to storytelling. “Narrative is about problem solving… about \nconflict…about interpersonal relations…about human experience…Narrative is about the \ntemporality of existence” (Ryan 2007, 24).  That being said, there are operational \ndefinitions of narrative that seek to establish frames and expectations for narrative.  Rick \nAltman’s narrowing of narrative definition components highlights two key elements; \naction and character.  “The existence of narrative depends on the simultaneous and \ncoordinated presence of action and character.  Narratives are not made of characters here \nand actions there but of characters acting” (Altman, 2008 15).  Additionally, narratives \ntranscend the form in which they occur.  As Altman also states, “however different the \nmedia that serve as a given story’s vehicles—however distinct the oral, written, \nillustrated, or film versions of a particular narrative—we readily recognize a story’s \n  \n \n10 \nability to be translated into different forms and yet somehow remain the ‘same’ story” \n(Altman 2008, 1).  While a narrative may be online or in a comic book or in a play, the \nstory remains constant. \nThe person or thing doing the action is a key factor in the narratives continuity \nand impact.  Brian Richardson posits four guiding components that make a theory of \ncharacter.  These are: mimetic connections to real human behaviors, formal character \nfunctions that support plot or establish patterns, embodied ideological positions, and the \nphysical body of the actor that can shift the character itself.  The first three components \ncan be seen in both written and verbal/aural narratives.  The fourth is unique to narratives \nthat are acted out, such as theatre, television, and movies (Richardson 2007). The \nphysical presence of the actor allows for one person to play different, roles and the ethos \nof the individual actor can impact the performance of the character.  As the majority of \nthe pieces I discussed with the participants were in a performed medium, this is a key \nfactor to keep in mind; the performer and means of performance matter.  For the purpose \nof this study, I narrow the scope of narrative I investigate to be those stories performed \nand acted (television, movies, theatre, online video) and not stories told through reading \n(comic books, graphic novels, short stories, and novels).  Queer narratives should be \nexamined because they represent a minority of the overall media narrative landscapes.  \nThey also present a minority community to the larger viewing audience.  For some \nnarrative consumers, their only exposure to a queer individual comes through television.  \nThey may not have out queer neighbors, friends, or co-workers, so the characters serve as \nstand-ins for the LGBTQ+ community.   \n  \n \n11 \nMedia Context \nNarratives are often told through the media.  Clear evidence exists of the media’s \npower over young people, functioning as a stand-in for adult role models and knowledge \nunavailable in schools.  Subject matter that parents, schools, or friends may have not \ndiscussed have the potential to enter youths’ worldview.  As Sheng Kuan Chung (2007) \nstates, “Most likely, the media generations learn about social issues like homosexuality \nnot from direct contact with gay people or from their parents, teachers and peers, but \nfrom characters and scenes depicted in…television programs” (Chung 2007, 99).  \nResearch also indicates that television has become a main source of information and tool \nfor adolescents to deal with life’s challenges.  “Some have labeled the media a sexual \n‘super-peer’ because of its role in establishing sexual norms and expectations for young \npeople” (Eyal et al. 2007, 317).  These norms are then repeatedly copied and passed \ndown.  For the purposes of my paper, I use television as a cluster term for broadcast, \nnetwork, and streaming televised productions.   \nIn our current digital society, these narratives can spread even more quickly \nthrough social media.  A 30-second commercial or YouTube video, for example, can be \nposted and then shared across the globe, creating instant discussions. Additionally, with \nhundreds of network channels available and a variety of media providers, each targeting \ndifferent viewing communities, the quantity of available narratives has exploded.  My \nresearch seeks to check these assertions with actual young people.  Do television, \ncommercial advertising, and the media serve as a super-peer, as previous research \nsuggests? \n  \n \n12 \nWhat young people see is also growing and changing.  The young people I \ninterviewed described a wide variety of narratives from a broadening array of easily \naccessible sources.  Youth consume narratives in greater numbers and have more \nnarratives easily accessible than in previous generations.  The majority of young people \nhave smart phones that connect to the Internet, and more specifically YouTube, at any \npoint during the day.  As a Pew Research Center study found, roughly 75% of teens have \naccess to a smartphone with a race/ethnicity access breakdown indicating that 85% of \nAfrican-American teens and 71% of white and Hispanic teens have smartphones.  \n(Lenhart et al. 2015, 2).  YouTube itself represents a shift in youth media viewing habits \naway from traditional media to new media; from top-down produced programming to \nbottom-up, interacting and reactive, user-created content.  Youth media in 2017 provides \ncreative outlets for young people to record their own videos, write their own blogs, and \nrespond to their peers.  Youth also have more channels on their televisions, have access \nto streaming video services, and Internet access at home.  With computers, tablets, \nlaptops, and smartphones, the narrative landscape once constrained to a television, movie \nscreen, or book, can now be easily accessed at the touch of a few buttons (McInroy \n2017).  As youth are more connected through social media and technology than adults, \nthese narratives have even greater significance.   \n Television and the narratives it advances are particularly potent because of the \nlarge amounts of time devoted to it by young people.  The key component is that \ntelevision, as well as other narrative mediums, are power communication devices that \nengage agentic youth.  Television is a primary medium for content knowledge and \n  \n \n13 \npsychological development (McInroy 2017).  While watching television they are not \nmerely absorbing new information but rather filtering, analyzing, and adapting to the \nvarious narratives, characters, and messages.   \nTraditional media also includes a new technology: streaming content.  The impact \nof Netflix and other streaming online programs are also significant because the majority \nof young people I spoke with watched their media programs on their phones, computers, \nor after the initial air date on television screens through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, \netc.  This allows teens to watch programming on their own in a comfortable environment.  \nWhether it is late at night in their rooms, while waiting for the bus to school, with friends \nor with family members, this flexibility represents a marked shift from 10 years ago when \npeople could only watch when the show aired or to record it on a VHS tape or, later, the \nDVR.  As a result of streaming online services, young people have more options \navailable.  Programs are accessible when they broadcast or released and on-demand after \nthey air.  Greater accessibility opens the door for a greater amount of narrative media \nmoments.   \nPrevious Research \nUsing research methods to unpack the images presented to young people is \nsignificant for several reasons.  First, it is important to see the variety or lack of variety of \nqueer representations to young people.  These representations inform young people about \ntheir own social constructions of queer life as well as their interactions with peers and \ntheir self-esteem.  Second, all media are essentially in the business to sell a product, so \nuncovering what sells informs what norms are present in society.  Third, cultural attitudes \n  \n \n14 \ntoward the LGBTQ+ community have shifted, so uncovering how the media landscape \nhas changed could inform the reasons behind it.  \nMy first foray into exploring this topic began with an in-depth survey of English-\nspeaking Theatre for Youth plays with queer narratives or queer characters.  Building off \nthe work by Annie Giannini (2009; 2010), as well as Manon van de Water (2012), I \nfound more plays than I had expected and yet the narrative kept repeating; queer victim \ngets bullied; queer victim finds some way to make it through; and the play concludes \nwith a nice moral ending.  Table 1 presents the list of play titles I researched.  I use an \nasterisk notation to indicate those that include a queer victim narrative.  Considering the \nconsiderable size of the Theatre for Young Audiences (TYA) canon, LGBTQ+ \nrepresentation is rather low (Giannini 2010; van de Water 2012).  As van de Water states, \n“When homosexuality is represented in TYA, it is treated as a calamity, discreetly \npackaged in plays intended to teach lessons about tolerance…contained in a  discourse of \n‘troubled gay youth’ which limits representation to those who are victimized because of \ntheir sexuality” (van de Water 2012, 82).  A quick glance showed that roughly 65% of \nthese plays rely on a victim narrative. \n  \n \n15 \nAnd yet, the characters presented onscreen were also problematically repetitive. \nTelevision sitcoms had moved from having queer guest characters and toward queer \nleading roles.  But the traditional media representations on major networks leaned toward \nmiddle-aged, White, gay men in committed relationships.  These characters lived \ncomfortable middle to upper class lifestyles, longed for children, but rarely had intimate \nmoments (Bond 2015).  The subtle messaging from the artistic producers became, “we \nTable 1: LGBTQ+ Theatre for Young Audiences Play Archive \nAll of Us by Laurie Brooks* \nAlong Came Tango by Emily Freeman \nAunty Ben by Sian Ni Mhuiri (UK) \nA Beautiful Thing by Jonathan Harvey* \nBlu by Gloria Bond Clunie* \nThe Children’s Hour by Lillian \nHellman* \nCootie Shots by Fringe Benefits \nfml: How Carson McCullers Saved My \nLife, by Sarah Gubbins* \nFun Home, by Lisa Kron and Jeanine \nTesori \nFood for the Dead by Josefina Lopez \nThe Geography Club by Brett Hartinger* \nThe Laramie Project by Moisés \nKaufman* \nOther Side of the Closet by Ed Roy* \nReflections of a Rock Lobster by Burgess \nClark* \nA Service for Jeremy Wong by Daniel S. \nKehde* \nSlipping by Daniel Talbott \nShe Kills Monsters by Qui Nguyen* \nTea and Sympathy by Robert Anderson \nThe Trans G Kid by Trisha Sugarek* \nThe Transition of Doodle Pequeño by \nGabriel Jason Dean* \nThe Wrestling Season by Laurie Brooks* \nVin by Stephen House (AUS)* \nYellow on Thursdays by Sara Graefe \n  \n \n16 \ncan watch you on television and laugh, but don’t make the viewing audience too \nuncomfortable with your overt queerness.”  The white-washed gendered depictions of the \nqueer community also neglected to reflect a modern, diverse United States.  \nNarrative Analysis Approach \nI utilize narrative analysis techniques to guide my study and to investigate the \ndata collected.   In particular, I use a feminist narratology or feminist narrative theory \napproach.  The analysis approaches a narrative text with an understanding it is linked to \nmaterial circumstances from history and culture.  This approach also understands that \ntexts do not reproduce reality but are constructed representations of the world.  This \nbroad term expresses a narrative focus which “covers the many different ways in which \ngender-related aspects of narratives and the models used to analyze them may be \ninterrogated from a feminist point of view…along with the neighboring areas of inquiry \nsuch as queer theory” (Page 2007, 189).  Context matters in a feminist narrative \napproach.  Ruth Page goes on to state that feminist narratology is especially concerned \nwith cultural constructions of gender as narrative analysis cannot “take place in a context-\nfree vacuum” (Page 2007, 189).  Robyn Warhol adds that feminist narrative theorists see \nthat “texts are always linked to the material circumstances of the history that produces \nand receives them.” (Warhol 2012, 9).  This connects well into my study because I am \ninterrogating the constructions of these forms as intentional actions built from individual \nor group motivations, expectations, stereotypes, and biases.  Some of my questions ask \nthe youth participants to directly examine why content creators make the choices they do \nand how social events impact representation.   \n  \n \n17 \nFeminist narrative theory in application examines a text from positions outside of \nthe heteronormative, male-dominated point of view.  As Warhol states, “class, race, \nnation, gender, sexuality, ethnicity dis/ability: feminist narrative theory tries to keep as \nmany of those balls in the air as possible, accepting responsibility for critiquing narrative \nmanifestations of all categories of oppression based on socially constructed identities” \n(Warhol 2012, 12).  This feminist focus on narrative that highlights intersectionality, the \npositionality of reader and creator, and social construction link well into my research. \nAfter-Queer Approach \nIn this study, I also deploy a newer theoretical approach addressing queer theory, \n“After-queer.” According to Talburt, after-queer seeks to bring back to life “queer’s \npotential by alternately centering and de-centering sexuality” (Talburt 2010, 50).  An \nafter-queer approach is a different way to examine the representations and treatment of \nqueer subjects.  Susan Talburt and Mary Lou Rasmussen (2010) position an after-queer \neducational approach as focusing on the ways representations of sexuality, gender, \nidentity and education intermix.   \nAn after-queer approach has been used in several studies to date (Crowley and \nRasmussen 2010; Charles 2010; Marshal 2010).  Claire Charles understands an after-\nqueer frame to be “about understanding connections that are produced between sexuality \nand broader cultural processes that seek to govern young people’s subjectivities” (Charles \n2010, 35).  Her research involves discussing femininity with youth in a school \nenvironment, similar to my interview-based research method.  She focuses on what can \nhappen beyond a limited sexuality discourse.  Her method and use of an after-queer \n  \n \n18 \napproach, and her exploration of the interactions between identity, privilege, and power \ninforms my study. \nMy use of an after-queer approach is heavily informed by Daniel Marshall and his \nexamination on how young people view popular culture representations of queer youth.   \nHe posits that an after-queer approach is possible now with a growing number of queer \nrepresentations.  While previous queer readings or views of media focused on a deficit-\napproach, where queers needed to read themselves into straight media depictions or \nnarratives, contemporary readings involve examining representations that are wholly \nqueer.  Instead of asking where the LGBTQ+ community fits into the narrative \nheteronormative landscape, an after-queer approach focuses on “critically reading the \nlimitations and the pleasures of explicit representations of gay and lesbian characters” \n(Marshall 2010, 76).  An after-queer approach has a few hallmarks that contribute to my \nstudy. \nFirst, an after-queer approach recognizes the viewer or consumer an active \nmember in the receptive and analytic process.  Views of queer youth, for the purposes of \nthis study especially, are “not constrained by notions of passive receptivity…Young \npeople are mobilizing self-aware understandings of the constructedness of representations \nof sexual identity” (Marshall 2010, 75).  Young people are engaging with each other \nabout the representations they see in traditional media, online, and in new media forms. \n Second, an after-queer method pays particular attention to young people’s \ncapacity for actively analyzing stereotypes and representation in complex ways.  “The \nimpact for the contributors is that it demonstrates their agentic capacity to analyze and \n  \n \n19 \nrespond to mass-produced representations of homosexuality” (Marshall 2010, 77).  Key \nto this development is that young queer individuals need to be able to separate themselves \nfrom the representation itself and read the constructions. \nAfter-queer reading practices then reflect agentic capabilities of young people to \ncritically distance themselves from stereotypes.  In this respect, the work of the \naudience is to read itself out of, rather than into, the text.  Or, to put it more \naccurately, reading one’s self out of the text is a defining characteristic of after-\nqueer reading practices. (Marshall 2010, 77-78). \n \nAn after-queer approach fits my study because it focuses on queer young people actively \nunpacking and examining queer representations.   \nMarshall’s definition and after-queer methodology informs my data collection \nprocess.  He advocates in his article that the after-queer approach occurs on a macro \nmedia level that aptly can address the historical trends in queer media.  I advocate data \ncollection can happen with youth.  Marshall’s focus is more on online discussion boards \nor other text-based mediated environments.  “Conducting this work at a media level, in \ncontrast to a direct data collection with young people themselves, is important because \ncultural contests over meaning commonly have a media dimension.” (Marshall 2010, 80).  \nHe indicates only those media researchers who have a larger grasp of the media \nlandscape can make this analysis, while also arguing an after-queer approach requires \nyoung people to engage in active discussion and agentic responses.  I argue that young \npeople are also capable of examining trends in media depictions and representations \nthemselves and can use their agentic voices in verbal discussions. \nParticipants \nThe participants in my study came from three Phoenix metro-area high schools \n  \n \n20 \nwhich contain a diverse socio-economic and student cultural background.  According to \nthe most recent census data, in 2016 the Phoenix metro area had approximately 4.7 \nmillion residents and the city of Phoenix, as the 6th largest in the United States had 1.6 \nmillion residents with a median age of 33.  Youth under the age of 19 account for 27% of \nthe metro population and 21% of youth live in poverty (Census Reporter 2016).  In terms \nof the racial and ethnic diversity in the metro area population is 56% White, 30% \nHispanic, 5% Black, 3.7% Asian, and 2% Native American (Census Reporter 2016). \nIn order to establish partnerships for field sites, I began by emailing faculty \nmembers in charge of Gay/Straight Alliances (GSA) at various high schools in the area \nand reaching out through my own personal networks.  I did not want to speak only with \nqueer youth about queer issues, so I also contacted teachers at an arts-school and a local \npublic high school to set-up sessions.  Teachers and staff at three sites agreed to be \ninvolved, and I determined that each site would have two focus groups with 5 to 15 youth \neach.  With each field site, I first visited each school to speak with the teacher or staff \nmember about the study and then returned to visit classrooms at each site and share the \nresearch study opportunity directly with the young people.  I asked interested young \npeople to complete an assent and consent form by the focus group session date the \nteacher and I had determined.  Three of the focus groups were school GSAs, one focus \ngroup was a study hall period, and two focus groups were completed during an arranged \ntime that gathered interested young people together from multiple classes and groups.  \nThese focus groups also contained a cross section of different sexual orientations, gender \nidentities, and racial/cultural backgrounds.   \n  \n \n21 \nBased on the responses and experiences during the focus group sessions, I \napproached seven individual youth for one-on-one case study interviews.  I selected \nparticipants from the focus groups based on their responses to the questions, their comfort \nwith the research process, and the depth of previous discussions.  I first ensured I had \napproval from the supervising faculty member at each site and then asked the student to \nparticipate in the longer interview.   \nEach participant up to age 18 in the focus group sessions and individual case \nstudy interview sessions completed a parental consent form and student assent form \nbefore I collected any data (Appendices A and B). Youth 18 years of age or older \ncompleted a consent form for themselves (Appendix C).  Additionally, each person chose \na pseudonym in order to protect the individual’s identity.  Each case study participant’s \nchosen name, indicated age, expressed gender identity, expressed sexual orientation and \nwritten race/ethnicity are provided in Table 2 below. \nTable 2: Case Study Participant Demographics \nName Age Gender identity Sexual orientation Race/Ethnicity \nOzzy 17 Transgender Female Bisexual White \nAnn-Jordan 14 Female Pansexual Palestinian \nAlice 17 Non-binary Asexual White \nPenelope 17 Female Lesbian White \nZol 16 Female Bisexual Latina \nTila 16 Female Lesbian Black \nLili 18 Transgender Female Straight Latina \n  \n \n22 \nMethodology: The Study \nIn order to better explore youth queer narratives, I used a qualitative research \nprocess which can be broken down into three data collection methods: questionnaires, \nfocus groups, and case studies.  This technique utilized youth in the research process and \nplaced a strong emphasis on their voice.  Four research studies strongly influenced my \nresearch design.  These included: Sarah Gomillion and Traci Giuliano’s (2011) use of \nquestionnaires; Shelley Craig et al.’s (2015) case study interviews and their focus on new \nonline media; Shannon Snapp et al.’s (2015) use of focus groups with youth under 18; \nand Victor Evan’s (2007) use of questionnaires, focus groups, and case studies with \nteenagers and adults.  In my study, each research method and data collection technique \nprovided a different type of information.  I received approval from the ASU Institutional \nReview Board (IRB) for the dissertation research on August 9, 2016 (Appendix D) and \nre-authorization for further data analysis on August 18, 2017 (Appendix E). \nQuestionnaires \nThe first data collection technique involved individual questionnaires.  One form \ncollected demographic information and included questions about age, race/ethnicity, \nsexual orientation, gender identities, and a series of questions on media usage and \nviewing technology (the number of screens) at home (Appendix F).  The second form \nwas a brainstorming questionnaire to allow individual youth to think through different \nnarrative mediums and where each sees queerness (Appendix G).  Rather than assume \nwhat young people would watch or view, I wanted to hear directly from them.  Based on \nmy previous work as an educator, I knew that the participants would want to process and \n  \n \n23 \nreflect on what they have seen in order to best discuss their observations and opinions \nwith peers. Participants completed both forms before we began the focus group sessions.    \nFocus Groups \nA second data collection technique was the use of focus groups at each field site.  \nI conducted six focus groups total with group size ranging from 5 to 15 participants.  I \ndetermined the focus group size primarily by youth availability and the time granted by \nthe teacher or staff member.  At one field site, I divided the large GSA group into two \nsmaller groups, as I only had a 45-minute window of time.   Focus Group Session 1 was \nthe first half of that population while Focus Group Session 2 was the other half.  Each of \nthese sessions focused on the same questions.  Focus Group Session 3 was the combined \ngroups and the discussion questions focused on what youth want to see in future \nnarratives and their overall thoughts about queer youth depictions.   We completed the \nother four focus groups in one session each.   \nI designed the focus groups to potentially examine responses from different \npopulations.  Three were composed of Gay/Straight Alliance members, two were young \npeople at an arts-based high school and one was a collection of youth in a study hall.  \nEach included a variety of identities in the room. \nDuring each focus group session, I held discussions using the same set of \nquestions (Appendix H). Through focus groups, young people described and defined \nfactors that led to queer legibility.  They also described their perceptions, desires (even if \ndifferent), and a collective knowledge.  Additionally, the youth focus groups produced a \nlarger list of narrative samples through a combined effort or snowball effect.  Ideas \n  \n \n24 \ntriggered more ideas, or fragments of ideas, that the rest of the group often completed. \nEach focus group ranged from 45 to 75 minutes long with attention paid to naturally \nflowing, comfortable dialogue. \nCase Studies \nThe third research method was individual case studies with seven individuals.   I \ninterviewed each participant for approximately 30 to 40 minutes and asked the same core \nquestions (Appendix I). Due to schedule constraints with one of the field sites, two of the \ncase studies happened one after another with the second participant hearing some of the \nquestions while the first participant spoke.  This allowed time for her to think about her \nown responses as well as reference the responses of her peer.  While not ideal, scheduling \ndifficulties at another site made me hold three case studies simultaneously.  I asked each \nquestion of each participant in sequence.  Often, the young people would add onto each \nother’s ideas or supplement the point with her own experiences but at the same time \nrespected each other enough to not interrupt a story or point.  I held the other two case \nstudies independently of each other. \nData Analysis \nI tabulated the data collected from the questionnaires into a spread sheet and \nexamined the brainstorming responses for patterns.  I categorized the television narrative \nresponses into mediums, then into genres.  Each of the other narrative mediums was \nseparated into its own table.  This data can be found in various tables throughout this \ndocument and in Appendices J through M.  \n  \n \n25 \nIn order to examine the qualitative research data, I transcribed each focus group, \nand had each case study transcribed by an outside service, which I double checked upon \ncompletion.  I coded each focus group and case study for content and patterns.  I went \nthrough a series of coding cycles to extract key narrative themes (Saldaña 2011).  Each \ncode is a “shorthand label to a piece of data that takes this datum apart and defines what it \nmeans” (Charmaz 2011, 165). First, I utilized a holistic coding method to examine \ngeneral ideas and concepts in the data by indicating general categories for the datum \nunits.  Next I coded the data in each category into smaller sub-codes.  I primarily utilized \ndescriptive coding (names of television shows, “identity marking”, and “stereotypes”) \nand values coding (“positive media feelings”, “more likely to watch”).  When a \ndescriptive code could not adequately describe a pattern, I used In Vivo coding to \nhighlight student perspectives through verbatim text (“Super-Gay”, “Tip-toe into Gay-\nness”.  The second round of coding refined and re-organized the codes into more \nmanageable units.  I then went through a categorization process where I clustered similar \ncodes together and also subdivided general codes into sub-codes.  For example, my first \nround of coding included a general code of “gay male stereotypes” and after that initial \nwave of coding, I broke down what was actually being said.  This included sub-codes like \n“uses hands a lot,” “effeminate gay male,” or “likes fashion.”  These codes can be found \nin Appendix N.  I used the qualitative coding software MAXQDA to help organize the \ncodes and aid in finding patterns in the research pieces.  From these codes and sub-codes, \nI developed larger themes such as what narratives do, how they impact youth, and how \n  \n \n26 \nyouth view narratives and media (Saldaña 2011).  Finally, I wrote on the themes, \nreflected on their interconnectedness, and significance.   \nMy research methodology, composed of the previously described data collection \ntechniques, has been designed to put youth voices at the center of the study.  Engaging \nyoung people’s experiences through a multi-modal approach via written brainstorming, \ngroup discussion, and individual interviews allow more voices to be heard in methods \nthat address a diversity of expressive preferences.  Additionally, my methodology attends \nto both breadth and depth of information.   \nResearcher Positionality \nI conduct this research from a particular point of view.  I taught secondary \nEnglish, speech, and theatre for seven years and bring in an ease in speaking with \nteenagers, education pedagogy and curriculum design, and underlying expectations on \nteacher/student power dynamics.  From my teaching experience, I also know that young \npeople have their own perspectives on life.  As an artist, I recognize the value of \nengaging youth as peers in the creative process.  As a theatre scholar, I have read and \nseen theatre that contains queer characters and have seen an increase in television shows, \nmovies, comic books, and children’s literature that present a wider diversity of the \nLGBTQ+ community.  Finally, as a gay man, my view of queer narrative contains \ntension between the seeing the value of queer characters embedded in media and with my \ndissatisfaction with those characters.  I’m torn between wanting quality queer narratives \nand knowing that increased queer visibility, even shoddy, can be valuable.  Combining \nthese three elements, I design this study to decentralize my position as a sage-on-the-\n  \n \n27 \nstage educator and explore these topics with youth.  In order to uncover/discover youth \nengagement with queer narratives and characters, my research put youth front and center.  \nEntering into the classroom to meet with youth, I present as an outside authority figure \nand must recognize and negotiate power dynamics based on my appearance and my \nidentity.  Additionally, as a white, cis-gendered, able-bodied, I recognize that these \nintersectional demographic categories add to my own positionality in relation to the queer \nsubject matter and the diverse youth participants.  I occupy multiple positions of power as \nan adult, an educator, a researcher, and as an outsider. \nChapter Preview \nI organize this dissertation into five chapters.  Chapter 1 gives an overview of the \nmethodology, research design, and underlying guiding theories of the project.  From this \nfoundation, I focus in Chapter 2 on narrative and character through representation, \nidentity, and stereotyping. Chapter 3 explores youth queer narratives through plot, tropes, \nand traditional media narrative accuracy.  I also examine where young people find \ninformation about queerness.  Additionally, both chapters 3 and 4 present youth solutions \nfor transforming traditional media.  Chapter 4 investigates the reflexive relationship \nbetween social networks and narrative.  Finally, Chapter 5 presents the implications of \nmy research and offers a way forward for the artistic community. \n  \n  \n \n28 \nCHAPTER TWO: CHARACTER REPRESENTATION AND YOUTH IDENTITY \nAfter examining the interview data collected from the focus groups and case \nstudies, several youth narrative themes emerged around the way characters are \nrepresented.  I connect these representation issues to youth identity, narrative effects on \nidentity, and what young people believe could be done to fix the problems they address.  \nBuilding from the previously established narrative definition, this chapter focuses \nparticularly on character and addresses the following related research questions.   \n• Where do young people find queer narratives? \n• How are youth identities affected by narratives? \n• How do youth see themselves and their own lives in relation to queer narratives? \nIn order to answer these questions, I utilize the concepts described in the preceding \nchapter, define the additional operational terms “media” and “identity,” and then examine \nidentity formation and representation.  Next I present four key themes, move into the \nintersections between narratives and identity, and finally present youth suggestions about \nhow to move forward.   \nDefining Media \n Lauren McInroy (2017) delineates narrative media into two forms: traditional and \nnew.  I utilize her definition to better isolate and examine different forms of \nrepresentational mediums.  She states, “Traditional media is predominantly characterized \nby offline technology, while new media is characterized by online (or computer-based) \ntechnology—and has been highlighted for its unique degree of interactivity and non-\nhierarchical structure” (2017, 41).  Her study went farther into youth perceptions of these \n  \n \n29 \ntwo media forms, and those young people highlighted the focus on social control and \ncommodification in traditional media versus the creative opportunities and interaction in \nnew media.  She also focused on media consumption versus media production. \nDefining Identity \nIdentity is socially constructed and negotiated through narrative.  We present \nourselves to each other and read the appropriateness or inappropriateness of others, and \nother’s identities.  Our individual identities may vary based on the situation as we utilize \ncode-switching to reflect the social environment and expectations.  Additional members \nof a social circle can affirm or reject a presented identity.  Even the markers of identity \nare co-created: socially constructed signs, symbols including clothing choices, hair styles, \nbody art, etc.  Steph Lawler states, “identity needs to be understood not as belonging \n‘within’ the individual person, but as produced between persons and within social \nrelations” (2008, 8).  This production of identity is particularly evident in the created \nnarratives.  These narratives then inform, reify, and support youth identity construction \n(Gomillion and Giuliano 2011; Kelso 2015; Marshall 2010).  A sociological view of \nidentity explains that the stories themselves serve to reify societal norms.  “Identity is not \nsomething foundational and essential, but something produced through the narratives \npeople use to explain and understand their lives” (Lawler 2008).  Identity is never fixed, \nand its development begins at birth.  In other words, each individual creates an identity \nand actively re-creates and modifies it throughout their lives in relation to other people.  \n  \n \n30 \nIntersectionality \nIdentity is also a multifaceted construction.  Intersectionality highlights that \nhumans are combinations of identities that combine in unique ways (Crenshaw 1991; \nHarper and Bruce 2016).  Other demographic factors, beyond queerness, should be \nexamined when looking at identity.  For example, in the United States context, a narrative \nportrayal of a black queer man is different from the portrayal of a white queer woman.  \nThe queerness of both cannot be lumped together due to this one LGBTQ+ factor.  \nCrenshaw emphasizes that identity structures relate to power and privilege within a \nsociety.  Power and privilege, in other words, are affected by intersectional identity \nfactors.  “I should say at the outset that intersectionality is not being offered here as some \nnew, totalizing theory of identity…My focus on the intersections of race and gender only \nhighlights the need to account for multiple grounds of identity when considering how the \nsocial world is constructed” (Crenshaw 1991, 1244-1245).  Crenshaw also posits three \ntypes of intersectionality: structural, political, and representational.  My research, while \ntouching on all three of Crenshaw’s delineations, is relevant in particular to \nrepresentational intersectionality.  Crenshaw states:  \nPerhaps the devaluation of women of color implicit here is linked to how women \nof color are represented in cultural imagery. Scholars in a wide range of fields are \nincreasingly coming to acknowledge the centrality of issues of representation in \nthe reproduction of racial and gender hierarchy in the United States. Yet current \ndebates over representation continually elide the intersection of race and gender in \nthe popular culture's construction of images of women of color. Accordingly, an \nanalysis of what may be termed \"representational intersectionality\" would include \nboth the ways in which these images are produced through a confluence of \nprevalent narratives of race and gender, as well as a recognition of how \ncontemporary critiques of racist and sexist representation marginalize women of \ncolor. (1991, 1282-1283) \n \n  \n \n31 \nMy work extends this representational intersectionality to the US American queer \ncommunity and how queer images are “produced through a confluence of prevalent \nnarratives” and “how contemporary critiques” of anti-queer, homophobic, transphobic, \nrepresentations marginalize the queer community. \nDisidentification \nIn order to better examine youth experiences of queer narratives and characters, I \nexamine disidentification.  Jose Esteban Muñoz advanced the theory that explored \nidentity and outward expressions of that identity through power relationships between the \noppressor and the oppressed, between the dominant majority and the marginalized \nminority.  “Disidentification is meant to be descriptive of the survival strategies the \nminority subject practices in order to negotiate a phobic majoritarian public sphere that \ncontinuously elides or punishes the existence of subjects who do not conform to the \nphantasm of normative citizenship” (1999, 4).  He stated that the minority, when faced \nwith the normalizing influence of the majority, disidentify in order to not just survive, but \nto change the system from within. \nDisidentification is the third mode of dealing with dominant ideology, one that \nneither opts to assimilate within such a structure nor strictly opposes it; rather \ndisidentification is a strategy that works on and against dominant ideology.  \nInstead of buckling under the pressures of dominant ideology (identification, \nassimilation) or attempting to break free of its inescapable sphere \n(counteridentification, utopianism), this ‘working on and against’ is a strategy that \ntries to transform a cultural logic from within, always laboring to enact permanent \nstructural change while at the same time valuing the importance of local or \neveryday struggles of resistance. (Muñoz 1999, 11-12) \n \nThe young people in my study exist in a similar space; working to establish their own \nidentity structures while feeling uncomfortable in the majority’s representational \n  \n \n32 \nconstructions.  This is not limited to gender or sexual identity but also includes other \nfactors. Disidentification is also intersectional as both concepts seek to explore identity \nfrom multiple combinations of identity structures which create unique matrices which \naffect social relationships and power dynamics (Muñoz 1999). \nCollected Queer Narrative Sources \n With those framing definitions established, I present some initial data findings to \nhelp inform the thematic analysis.  As described earlier, the young people began the \nresearch study by filling out a questionnaire/brainstorming activity.  I asked them to list \nwhere they see queerness on television (broadcast, network, and streaming), in movies, in \nprint, onstage, online, and in other popular culture forms.  Table 3 shows the television \nshows that received more than 4 mentions.  The additional data tables, including \ntelevision shows with under four mentions, can be found in Appendix J.  Television \nshows were the most often mentioned and dominated the overall discussion. In the data \nset itself, I include the network which broadcasts the show, the genre, and the TV \nParental Guidelines.  As one can see, of all the media forms and narrative pieces listed, \nthe young people referenced Orange is the New Black the most.   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n33 \nTable 3: Questionnaire Responses: Television with Ratings, Genre, and Network \nTitle Count Rating Genre Network \nOrange is the New Black 32 TV-MA Drama Netflix \nModern Family 22 TV-PG Comedy ABC \nGlee 19 TV-PG Comedy Fox \nThe Fosters 18 TV-14 Family ABC Family \nAmerican Horror Story 12 TV-MA Drama FX \nEllen 10 TV-G Talk NBC \nAdventure Time 7 TV-PG Cartoon Cartoon Network \nHow to Get Away with Murder 6 TV-14 Drama ABC \nGrey’s Anatomy 6 TV-14 Drama ABC \nBlack Mirror 6 NR Drama Netflix \nThe Real O’Neals 6 TV-PG Comedy ABC \nSteven Universe 6 TV-PG Comedy Cartoon Network \nHow I Met Your Mother 5 TV-14 Comedy CBS \nRu Paul’s Drag Race 4 TV-14 Reality Logo/VH-1 \nThe Office 4 TV-PG Drama NBC \nRegarding theatre pieces, the young people identified works they had seen \nonstage but also those pieces the school was producing.  Young people at one site, for \nexample, were putting on a production of Almost, Maine and proudly shared the story \nwith their classmates.  At another site, the young people were part of a production of \nSpring Awakening.  They stated,  \nYOUTH 1.  Spring Awakening, am I right? \n  \n \n34 \nYOUTH 2.  We are doing it, this-- \nYOUTH 3.  I put that too. \nYOUTH 1.  Come see it, it’s going to be great. (Focus Group Session Six 2017) \n \nThis highlights that youth identify queer theatre pieces they have seen in person.  While \ntelevision shows, movies, and new media pieces can be easily shared and viewed by \nconsumers, theatre productions need to be encountered during the run of the show at a \nspecific site.  The focus groups knew of theatre pieces, but certainly not to the extent of \ntelevision, movies, and online content.  Table 4 presents the works mentioned.  Another \ninteresting discovery is that none of the youth responses match the list of queer TYA \nplays referenced in Chapter 1.   \nTable 4: Questionnaire Responses: Theatre \nTitle Count \nRent 10 \nSpring Awakening 6 \nRocky Horror Picture Show 4 \nAvenue Q, Dog Sees God, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, La Cage Aux \nFolles, Falsettos \n3 \nAlmost, Maine, Victor Victoria, School of Rock, Cabaret, The Producers, \nThe Book of Mormon, The Color Purple, In the Heights \n2 \nHazelwood Senior High, Mama Mia, Angels in America, Polaroid Stories, \nIn Moonlight, Black Boys Look Blue, Blue Galaxy, Hamilton, Bare: A Pop \nOpera \n1 \n  \n \n35 \nThere is a complete disconnect between the works the youth have seen and the queer \nTheatre for Young Audiences plays (TYA) I had previously examined.  Geography, \nproduction frequency, and theatre-going behaviors certainly could be a factor, as could \nthese teenagers’ interest in works that target older audiences.   \nNarratives Affect Identity \nSeveral themes emerged from the data regarding the intersections of identity and \nrepresentation.  These are that narratives affect identity, narratives reinforce stereotypes, \nnarratives reflect the viewer, and narratives limit possibilities.  Before heading into the \ndata, I connect my findings to other previous research.  To begin, narratives influence \nidentity formation.  Humans use stories to make sense of the world around us and then \ncreate stories to represent our journeys.  Media takes these stories of self-expression and \ntransmit them to other individuals creating their own stories.  Through similarity, \nfamiliarity, and wishful identification, these media narratives inform and shift this \nidentity formation process.  The television shows themselves function as a way to share \nidentities.  “We endlessly tell stories about our lives, both to ourselves and to others; and \nit is through such stories that we make sense of the world, of our relationship to that \nworld and of the relationship between ourselves and other selves” (Lawler 2008, 12).   \nThe tales we weave showcase our values, beliefs, attitudes and the conditions for \nnarrative social acceptability.   \nThe media narratives also can inform gender schemata, or structures of how \ngenders should behave (Nathanson et al. 2002).  Narratives also compound on each other \nto create these structures.  The story does not work independently, as it builds on \n  \n \n36 \npreviously held stories.  “The narrative cannot stand alone but must refer to and draw on \nwider cultural narratives...about how class impacts living arrangements, about working-\nclass respectability and a kind of alternative middle-class existence” (Lawler 2008, 12). \nIn other words, the story-narratives we tell are built off of, draw from, and reinforce the \ncultural narratives we promulgate.  The long arc of this narrative has changed during the \npast 50 years, but still carries with it certain norms and stereotypes. \nFor queer youth, these representations become particularly important as the \nnarratives become strong role models, informing identity formation (Fisher et al. 2004).  \nTelevision narratives are a “strong influence on sexual identity formation, behavioral \nchoices made by teens, particularly as they grow into emerging adulthood” (Meyer and \nWood 2013, 436).   Gomillion and Giuliano point out that these messages last well into \nadulthood.  “Media experiences contribute to individuals’ development of their sense of \nself and…these experiences remain salient into young adulthood and possible beyond” \n(2011, 332).  Narratives have a persistent influence on identity construction. \nNarratives function by connecting with individuals and communities.  First, the \nnarrative needs to be similar to the viewer (Gomillion and Giuliano 2011; Squire 2012).  \nNarratives that create “everyman” character serve as a fill-in for a real person the viewer \nmay know.  While the struggles of the main character might not be the exact struggles of \nthe viewer, they are similar enough to create an effective narrative.  Narratives also \nfunction by bringing disparate groups of people into the same family.  This \nfamiliarization (Squire 2012) uses family tropes to link groups together under one \numbrella or the ethics of common humanity.  Familiarization functions by connecting \n  \n \n37 \npeople through common human experiences like love and belonging.   Finally, narratives \nfunction through wishful identification (Gomillion and Giuliano 2011).  This involves the \ncharacters or role models presented to the viewer and wanting to be just like that person.  \nViewers focus on positive attributes and actions, then model that behavior.  Through \nsimilarity, familiarization, and wishful identification, narrative functions as a strong \ninfluence in media landscapes. \nTheme #1: Self-Awareness and Self Recognition \nSelf-awareness is an inner sense of who we are and how we feel.  When we see \nthings on television or in person, we sense if it matches to our own identities at the \nmoment or if it does not.  One element of the first theme can be seen through young \npeople discussing their queer origins and when queer narratives entered their worlds.  \nThis can be seen in Tila’s story.  Tila, a 16-year-old black lesbian, knew from an early \nage that she was a lesbian, though not by that name.  “When I was little, I knew that I \nliked girls, but I didn’t know what it was called” (Tila 2017).  She was aware of her \nattraction and preferences and this played into her sense of self.  Lili had a similar \nexperience.  She stated, “I knew – when I was four years old, I told my mom, ‘I want to \nbe a girl.’ Of course, I didn’t know that meant transgender, or anything like that. I kept \nsaying, ‘Why can’t I be a girl?’” (Lili 2007).  These two experiences highlight how self-\nawareness can connect with representational forces.    \nTila noticed that she saw only one type of lesbian on television, and she knew she \ndid not fit that role.  “They don’t really have these kinds of lesbians on a show. They \nhave the girly kind… You’re either a femme or you’re a stud. So, you’re either girly, or \n  \n \n38 \nyou’re a dyke.  I’m a dyke” (Tila 2017).  She clicked with the term “dyke” and viewed \nher options in a binary split between masculine and feminine.  For her, the media was \none-sided and did not match her identity.  She recognized the disconnect between what \nshe saw and what she felt at that moment.  She describes herself as a “dyke,” and a \nmasculine lesbian and struggles to find other masculine lesbian portrayals.  However, \nseeing Tila Tequila on the reality dating show A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila stood out \nto her.  The bisexual star was one that Tila thought was really attractive.  She states:  \nTILA. I watched – I don’t even know the name of these shows. It was a pretty gay \nshow. What are those shows called, where you’re trying to find love? \nINTERVIEWER.  Like a dating show? \nTILA.  Yeah. It was one girl, and she was – it was either a boy or a girl. She was \nbi, on the show.  Tila Tequila!  I was a really little kid, and I don’t think I was \nsupposed to be watching that, but yeah. That’s where I learned what I was, \nfrom that show...It changed my life. (Tila 2017) \n \nTila is also negotiating what is allowed and not allowed in her household.  Watching this \nshow was a risk, but she watched anyway and the show helped her unpack her identity.   \nSelf-Recognition and Identity \nWhen young people see themselves in the narrative and identify with the \ncharacters or characteristics, they recognize themselves onscreen.  This is often an “aha” \nmoment that crystalizes a sense of self in an individual.  These self-recognition moments \noccurred throughout the focus group and case student interviews and connect to the first \ntheme.  Penelope, a young lesbian, talks about her recognizing herself and her identity \nbeing bolstered on the Netflix show, Orange is the New Black.  This show tells the story \nof Piper, a bisexual middle class white woman who is put in jail for committing several \n  \n \n39 \ncrimes.  For Penelope, seeing the “right kind” of lesbian that fit her sense of style and \nwhat she was feeling was an eye-opening experience. \nPENELOPE: I remember watching Orange is the New Black and there was a \ncharacter who was – I think it was Piper, actually, who was very feminine, but I \nthink she's bi, but like gay, whatever, it's kind of – but I remember her being like \nvery feminine and pretty and I remember her talking about being gay or being bi \nor basically being attracted to women. And I remember being like, oh, yeah, I'm – \nI remember just like a moment of clarity, like the heavens opened up and I was \nlike I'm gay. It's not that I just think girls are pretty. I'm attracted to girls. I've \nnever been attracted to men…It was wild. (Penelope 2017) \n \nBefore this moment, she expressed the only lesbian options she saw were butch, \nmasculine women.  This show provided a new frame, a new identity possibility.  I find it \nsignificant that while Penelope and Tila are both about the same age and both identify as \nlesbians, neither saw “their kind” of lesbian in the media.  Penelope spoke about the \noverabundance of masculine lesbians while Tila had the exact opposite observation with \nher view of a field full of feminine lesbians.   \nZol, a young bisexual Latina, identified her bisexual starting point from the \ntelevision show Victorious. “I used to think Jade was bisexual because she would go \naround kissing other girls, and she’d still have a boyfriend. I was like, ‘It’s kind of cool. I \ndig it’” (Zol 2017).  Participants noted the lack of bisexual representation in the media \nand even Zol had a hard time coming up with examples.  For her, this show was a \nbenchmark bisexual representation moment, and she recognized herself in the piece.   \nThe student participants recognized the power of the media to adjust social \nexpectations and the individual schema.  Penelope states, “I feel like it's a split thing. \nBecause of media, I feel like I thought of lesbians as such a stereotype being they had to \nbe butch, they had to have short hair, they had to be into cars or whatever. But also \n  \n \n40 \nbecause of media, that kind of crushed that view I had in my head and told me more \nabout myself” (Penelope 2017).  The media narrative is framing and using schema to \nidentify possibilities--reinforcing, challenging, and building their identity.  This becomes \nproblematic in that not all schema adequately contribute to understanding the world \naround us.   \nSelf-Awareness, Self-Recognition, and Representation in Action \nBoth self-awareness and self-recognition, as well as the power of representation, \ncan be seen in Lili’s story.  Her supportive family, the strong links she made between her \nidentity and a reality star’s journey, made me wonder about the underlying relationship \nbetween a young person’s identity and how they engage with queer narratives.   \nLILI: It’s weird to start. Okay. I’m 17. I’m a senior, graduating in – not four weeks, \nbut done with school in four weeks.  I’m transgender, male to female. I started \ntaking hormones--about a month now; it’s been a month. It’s going really good. I \nthink, orientation-wise, I would identify myself with straight. It’s still something I \ncontemplate. What do I say exactly? From everyone’s perspectives, they kind of \nsay, “Just go with straight,” so I say, “Okay, I’m straight.”  It’s always going back \nand forth with, “Oh, so you’re gay,” because I still like guys, or, “You’re straight \nbecause you’re a girl that likes guys.” It’s kind of between those two, so I’m just \nlike, “You know what? I’m just going to go with straight.” \n \nSixth grade was when it really hit me, because I ended up having a crush on a guy, \nand I did not know how to respond to that or anything like that, so I was always just \nvery conservative and kept to myself around him. If he tried talking to me, I was \nsuper shy about it. \n \nSixth grade was also the time that my family decided to get Netflix for the first \ntime. And so, I was like, “Oh, okay, let’s try to find something to watch.” I had \nwatched a whole bunch of scary movies and things like that, things that I enjoy, \nand I came across RuPaul’s Drag Race. So, I talked to my mom about it because, \nof course, I didn’t know every single term within the gay community and things \nlike that; I was still learning about it. And, I talked to my mom, and I was like; \n \nYOUNG LILI. “RuPaul’s Drag Race. What is this? Is it…It’s a woman, and it \nsays, ‘drag race.’ Is she the host or something?”  \n  \n \n41 \nMOTHER. “No, that’s a drag queen.”  \nYOUNG LILI. “What’s a drag queen?”  \nMOTHER. “That’s actually a man, and he dresses up as a woman.”  \n \nLILI: I came to thinking, “Really?”  So, I started watching the show, season after \nseason, and I kept thinking to myself, “If she could do that, I could do that.” I \nknew – when I was four years old, I told my mom, “I want to be a girl.” Of \ncourse, I didn’t know that meant transgender, or anything like that. I kept saying, \n“Why can’t I be a girl?” So, it comes back to me in sixth grade. “Oh, my gosh. I \ncan do this.” So, I would take some of my mom’s clothes, and her shoes, and try it \non. I didn’t know how to do makeup, so I didn’t do any makeup. (Lili 2017) \n \nFrom this piece of text, several key ideas come forward.  First, her social circle was \nsupportive of her journey; in particular, her mother was the supportive parent she needed.  \nLili’s mom was able and willing to answer questions about the LGBTQ+ community.  \nNot only does her mother know about drag queens but also allows her then-son to try on \nher clothes and shoes.  This type of supportive environment certainly contributes to a \nyoung person experimenting with and discovering identity.   \nNext, Lili indicates she had feelings of being different from a young age, as she \nwas not sure how to engage in a first crush with a boy.  This was complicated by her \ngender identity and her sexual orientation.  In terms of gender identity, as a child she \nknew she wanted to be a girl and latched onto drag as the physical means to this inner \ndesire.  Later she learns about the differences between drag performance and transgender \nidentity.  In terms of sexual orientation, as a child she knew she liked boys.  As a boy \nliking boys she worked through her own feelings about being gay and became shy around \nher crush.  Lili’s experience highlights the complexity of gender and sexuality and that \noversimplifying the queer experience can be dangerous.   \n  \n \n42 \nFinally, this piece of text also illustrates that her early curiosity about gender \nrepresentation, as young as four years old, lingered until it found a frame, a \nrepresentation that allowed her to name her identity.  Her experience demonstrates \nMuñoz’s disidentification.  Faced with either presenting a “normal” teenager or a “radical \ndrag-queen”, Lili found a middle ground that appeased both her inner identity and outer \nsocial pressures.  She used the narratives and identities presented to her and found one \nthat worked well for her.  She identifies and sympathizes with RuPaul and the contestants \nwhen she says, “If she could do that, I could do that.”  These became role models for her \nbehavior and identity.  Jesse Fox and Rachel Ralston highlight the importance of role \nmodels for those communities, such as the transgender community, that are less \nfrequently portrayed in media.  “Online role models were most essential for individuals \nwith identities that are rarely portrayed or invisible in regular media, such as asexuals or \nindividuals going through gender transitions” (2016, 641).  While some young people in \nthe queer community may watch RuPaul’s Drag Race and wish to become a drag queen, \nLili goes on to say she was inspired by a particular queen and her coming out of the trans-\ncloset. \nLILI: It was when Carmen Carrera – one of the contestants on RuPaul’s Drag \nRace – she came out as transgender. She said, “I am a female” …She had a huge \ninspiration for me because she ended up becoming a model, and I wanted to \nbecome a model, too, and all these different things. So, that’s where I learned the \ndifference, because I had decided to look it up on my own terms, and it said, “A \ntransition from male to female” …I looked into that more. There’s hormones \ninvolved, surgeries involved. She looked like a female, and I said, “That’s what I \nwant to become.” (Lili 2017) \n \nThe narrative, the character, the person Carmen Carrera, and her coming out journey \nframed the trans-gender option.  This moment of similarity, a trans-Latina watching a \n  \n \n43 \ntrans-Latina onscreen, and identification through shared goals, kicked off her desire to \nlearn more.  With the more-realized sense of self, and with support of her social group, \nLili was able to take her “drag” identity into the public. \nLILI: My first time going out in what I considered drag at the time – it was First \nFriday, and I went out, and this one person complimented my hair. My mom \nthought he was just being an asshole, but I was like, “Oh, my God, he \ncomplimented me.” I was all happy about it. That’s where it all went into place. \nRuPaul was the biggest person to impact me in that way. (Lili 2017) \n \nLili’s journey as a young trans-woman is informed by RuPaul’s Drag Race.  This \nprovided new information for a young child which then grew into questions and curiosity.  \nHer family was supportive of this identity exploration and it crystalized when a particular \ncharacter shared her own journey as a trans-woman.  The narrative provided a set of \noptions for the viewer and, in this case, it supported a developing identity.   \nTheme #2:  Narratives Reflect (or Do Not Reflect) the Viewer \nOne of the first questions I asked the focus groups was simple and direct; “Do you \nsee yourself on TV?”  While I was curious about more general identification in terms of \ndemographic factors like race, gender-identity, sexual orientation, religion, and age, I also \nwanted to see where they saw similarity and differences.  On a micro-level, some of the \ncase study participants saw themselves in particular characters.  However, on the macro-\nlevel, the focus groups provided a resounding “no.”  The varied answers, while circling \nthe same rejection of queer representation in traditional media, can be divided into issues \naround sexuality, gender-identity, physical appearance, and performance.  First, one \nyoung person pointed out that representation sticks to binary constructions.  A character \nis cis-gendered male or female and likes men or women. “Not really, because I feel like it \n  \n \n44 \nsticks to the very I am cis-gendered, I am straight...well not straight, but I'm like either I \nonly like girls or only like guys” (Focus Group Session One 2016).  This participant is \npointing out the small list of sexuality and gender representations options available in \ntraditional media representations. \nThe young people recognize their sexual orientations are not there and, when \nthere are queer representations, they tend to be gay men.  Again, traditional media \nrepresentations are built from a binary choice between male and female, gay and straight.  \nRepresentations that blur the binary are not as present.  The adolescents noted a lack of \nasexuality and pansexuality, transgender characters, and bisexual characters, too. Alice \nindicated; \nYOUTH: Oh, yeah, for sure. Like I was saying earlier, a lot of times the media \njust portrays gay people and very rarely a trans person, but there’s no asexual \nrepresentation. There’s no pansexual representation. There’s no just non-binary or \ngender fluid representation. There’s none of that. It’s just the very like “there are \ngay people who are homosexual” and that’s it. That’s kind of the portrayal that \nwe’re seeing nowadays. (Focus Group Session Five 2017) \n \nThe focus groups also commented on the rare bisexual depictions on television. \n “A lot of shows refuse to even say the word bisexual.  Like they'll kinda hint at it but \nthey won't actually say it.  The only show I've heard say it is on, the one about the \ndoctors...Grey's Anatomy.  That's the only one that I've heard say that word” (Focus \nGroup Session One 2016).  In general, they observed the representations on television do \nnot present identities that exist on a spectrum nor in terms of ethnicity or race.   \n The young people observed that the queer characters presented onstage are \noverwhelmingly white.  One young person stated, “I think another big thing is the like the \nwhite family, because there is never anything with like a cultural background.  Like \n  \n \n45 \nthere’s never anybody saying, ‘Look at how my Muslim family deals with me being \ngay.’  Anything but being white and Christian” (Focus Group Session One 2016).  \nFurthermore, they saw this lack of representation as a political issue that producers want \nto avoid.  In the following passage, note the imaginary line they draw. \nYOUTH 1.  Yeah so instead of like going into a whole different religion and \nethnicity and background... \nYOUTH 2.  Yeah, that would be too much... \nYOUTH 1.  Yes, but that also means that white people and men and straight are \nall the default, and that's a big problem.   \nYOUTH 2.  That's a big problem in general. (Focus Group Session One 2016) \n \nThey assert that more racial and ethnic diversity cannot happen as doing so would be “too \nmuch”—presumably for the white viewing audience.  The young people echoed \nobservations made by film industry observers, critics, and the common viewer; the media \nonly shows a small variety of races and genders onscreen.  When asked about which \nshows present non-white and non-gay characters, the youth could only come up with a \nfew.  This list included The Fosters and How to Get Away with Murder; with a mixed-\nrace couple, Sense 8; with transgender characters, ethnic diversity, and a variety of \nrelationships, Orange is the New Black.  \nFinally, not only are the characters predominantly white, the young people go on \nto indicate the portrayed characters are more attractive, “they are prettier” (Focus Group \nSession Five 2017) and colorful, “they're just like over-exaggerated attitudes” (Focus \nGroup Session One 2016).  These representation constructions idealize physical beauty \nthat falls along cis-gendered standards.  Yet, these also break cis-gender expectations of \nbehavior through previously described feminine male and masculine female traits. \n  \n \n46 \nTheme #3:  Narratives Reinforce Stereotypes  \nNarratives also reify and advance stereotypes.  Stereotypes are not inherently \nnegative or positive but they do contain generalizable observations about a group of \npeople.  To take a step back, a stereotype is an overgeneralization about a group of \npeople, often discounting individual differences for group characteristics.  This differs \nfrom schema as schema contain collected information that humans use to make sense of \nthe world around them.  Schema can be very focused and detailed, while stereotypes \novergeneralize everything.  Narrative stereotypes are thought as shortcuts, and the media \nuses stereotypes to entertain and inform their audiences.  “The media industry \nunderstands that people learn about others through internalized images as stereotypes.  \nWithout stereotypes, a sitcom or film would make little sense to the viewer” (Chung \n2007, 100).  They allow the viewer to understand a character or situation with less work \non the part of the performer and audience.  Narrative can, however, advance distorted \nstereotypes of a group of people.  When overused stereotypes represent only a small \nportion of a wider population, they can negatively influence the viewer.  Stereotypes are \nalso problematic because they over-simplify complex distinctions into reductive binaries.  \nA stereotyped character is either masculine or feminine, gay or straight, sexual or \nvirginal, normal or abnormal.  Narrative representation should stretch beyond limited \nstereotypes and into the gray areas between these black and white polarities.  Judith \nButler points out that this danger should not limit the discourse or performance itself.  \nShe states, “certainly, it remains politically important to represent women, but to do that \nin a way that does not distort and reify the very collectivity the theory is supposed to \n  \n \n47 \nemancipate” (2004, 197).  While Butler refers to women and feminism, it certainly \napplies to the study and representation of the LGBTQ+ community as well.  It is \nimportant to represent same-sex couples and to not reify heteronormative constructions. \nAlong with general knowledge on potentially new ways of living, young people \ncan also be introduced to new stereotypes or have existing stereotypes reinforced.  When \nthe media presents these, they can reinforce existing beliefs, however flawed.  Amber \nRaley and Jennifer Lucas state, “People who watch TV for longer periods of time are \nmore likely to give a stereotypical ‘television answer’” than those who do not watch \ntelevision as much, regardless of demographic (2006, 21).  In other words, the \nconsistently delivered narrative constructions can sway people to not consider other \noptions.  Young people, as well as the larger viewing audience, see these stereotypes as \nrealistic.  This becomes particularly problematic when queer characters and stories are \nportrayed in the media.   \nWhile increased queer visibility since the early 2000s in television shows, film, \nand other narrative sources is laudable, it has both negative and positive outcomes. The \nnarratives are both informing the audience about a group of people but are also \nreinforcing stereotypes.  “Although broader representation of lesbian and gay characters \nin the media helps to demystify homosexuality, the repeated portrayal of lesbian and gay \nstereotypes not only reinforces depersonalized images of gay people, but also mis-\neducates children and the public about homosexuality” (Chung 2007, 100).  Exposure to \ndepictions of same-sex couples, queer youth, and the LGBTQ+ community on television \nserves as a double-edged sword.  It both exposes a wider public audience to LGBT \n  \n \n48 \nculture but potentially also presents a stereotyped, limited view of the queer experience.  \nWhile producers and audiences are not monolithic, portrayals can be. \nStereotypical representations also reinforce negative stereotypes.  These \nstereotypes come from a variety of media sources, both traditional and new.  According \nto Raley and Lucas’ study, youth are learning from “heterosexist and homophobic \nsources of misinformation on TV” (2006, 22).  Gender roles, for example, are often \nreified by sitcoms and commercial advertising (Fisher et al. 2004).  As commercials have \nto pack a lot of information into a short 30 or 45 seconds, they are particularly potent.  \nBefore new media gained a strong youth foothold, television programming and the \ncorresponding commercials served as a primary content delivery method, rich with \nstereotypes.  Eleven years later, McInroy continues to examine stereotypes and \nrepresentations in new media, highlighting their staying power.  Even with the rise of \nstreaming services and new media, advertising still contains stereotypes.  “LGBTQ \npeople have consistently been stereotyped as comic relief, villains, and/or criminals, \nmentally and/or physically ill, and victims of violence.  These stereotypes remain \nprevalent and may contribute to ongoing societal homophobia and heterosexism” \n(McInroy 2017, 34).  In 2017, as well as 2006, commercials are often repeated across \nnetworks, digital platforms, and social media; they serve as an even more persuasive \nnarrative tool. \nThis one-sided narrative experience can have negative impacts.  Queer youth may \nnot have queer role models at home or in their community, so they find out about the \nqueer world through television or connect through new media environments.  However, \n  \n \n49 \nwhen the narratives and characters are unlike these youth, it can challenge their own \nidentities.  The stereotyped narrative can affect the very youth these traditional media \npieces might seek to support.  “Many lesbian and gay youth and adults remain in the \ncloset partly because they have failed to identify with the stereotypical characteristics of \nlesbian and gay people portrayed in the media” (Chung 2007, 101).  The cis-gendered, \nwhite, middle class, fit, coupled mold can be a daunting role-model for queer youth who \nmatch few of those categories, if any. \nThe youth participants express negotiating the positive and negative components \nof representation, as well.  Through critical thinking and reflection, they recognize that \nthe media can affirm identity and/or wash over the complexities therein.   Penelope \nstated, \nPENELOPE: When I see queer people in the media, I'm always like, \"Hey, \nrepresentation, yay!\" And like I said, it's getting a lot better. There's still \nsometimes when there's a stereotype, but stereotypes are also kind of rooted in \ntruth, so as long as they're not offensive stereotypes – I'm kind of flip-flopping on \nwhat I said earlier, but as long as they're not like offensive stereotypes, \nrepresentation is still a very valuable thing. So, I'm always excited when I see \nqueer people in media. I definitely will like be more tempted to watch a show if \nthere's like a queer character in it. (Penelope 2017) \n \nShe, along with other focus group participants, appreciated the increase in quantity but \nhad to negotiate that with the difference in representation quality.  The young people \ncame up with stereotypes which can be organized into several categories. \nThe images that are presented to young people often are in the form of \nstereotypes.  While talking with the focus groups, they highlighted these patterns.  We \ntalked about the strongest stereotypes, why traditional media producers of these \nnarratives tend to rely on them, and how young people who have little contact with others \n  \n \n50 \nin the LGBTQ+ community may be influenced by these representations.  These \nstereotypes fall into four major categories.  These include the feminine gay male, the \nmasculine lesbian, the oversexualized bisexual, and the comic transgender punchline. \nNext, I examine each of these stereotypes.   \nFeminine Gay Men \n The first of the stereotypes to be examined is the feminine and flamboyant gay \nman.  Of all the stereotypes discussed, this one came up more frequently than the others.  \nWhen asked how the young people know a character is gay, they quickly went to \nfeminine features, an interest in fashion, and a sassy flamboyant attitude.  Here are just a \nfew of the comments. \nYOUTH A.  I think playing into a little queer stereotypes here, people who are \ngay are usually seen as a little more flamboyant and now musicals are very \nflamboyant and colorful things. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nYOUTH B.  I know someone is queer by the way they walk and talk.  Like a \nsassy walk. (Focus Group Session Five 2017)  \n  \nYOUTH C.  Usually the way they look.  Usually when I see shows, they portray \nthe gay stereotype as more feminine. (Focus Group Session Five 2017) \n \nYOUTH D.  But he's [Kurt from Glee] super gay. There are two characters that \nare super gay. Every other episode, he breaks out into a song and dance. He \nsings Sia sometimes. Sia's great. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nYOUTH E.  He [Kurt] dresses femininely in the Halloween episode, which not all \ngay people would. But stereotypically – he has hair curlers. He acts really \nfeminine. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nWith each of these examples, the femininity and physical behavior of gay male characters \nreinforces this dominant stereotype.  One problem with stereotypes is that it impacts how \nothers view the gay community.  When asked, “How do you think that [stereotyped \n  \n \n51 \nportrayals] affect people that don’t know queer people?”, the youth highlighted that these \nstereotypes could actually mislead individuals into thinking feminine men must be gay \nand masculine men must be straight. \nYOUTH: Especially with gay men in the show, they'll see they're like normally \nfeminine and then if they come across someone who is feminine, they'll just \nassume they're gay, and not even like ask them.  They could very well be straight, \nbut they just, they're just represented in that stereotypical way. (Focus Group \nSession Two 2016) \n \nThe youth are recognizing the differences between expectation and reality; that not all \ngay men are feminine and that not all feminine individuals are gay.  The traditional media \nproducers are not as discerning.  This also connects to the youths’ more nuanced and \nspectrum-based understanding of sexuality and gender.  \nThe television show Glee came up several times with regards to stereotypes.  \nSpecifically, the young people discussed Kurt’s character as being plugged right into a \nfew different stereotypes.  First, he is laid out as a feminine character that is obsessed \nwith fashion, Lady Gaga, musical theatre, and other more flamboyant pop culture \nlandmarks.  One member of the focus group stated: \nYOUTH: I think, please don't be angry at me, but I think Glee is kinda horrible \nwith a, what's that guy’s name him always being like \"Oh my god!,” oh yeah \nKurt.  He's like I love clothes, AHHHH.”  They make him over flamboyant and \nall he cares about is make-up and he wants to only be friends with girls.  (Focus \nGroup Session Three 2016) \n \nWhile Kurt certainly broke ground in popular culture for presenting a feminine young \ngay man, some of the young people had a negative reaction to the portrayal.  The youth \nrecognized that the queer community has a wide variety of expressions but expressed \nfrustration that they kept seeing the same construction that culminated in Kurt Hummel.  \n  \n \n52 \nSome of the young people expressed annoyance with Kurt because he did not present a \n“normal” gay teenager characterization and pushed too far into the extreme gay male \nfigure.  They wanted a safer, middle of the road representation that both appeased their \ninner identities and the outer social pressures.   \nMasculine Lesbian Women \nThe young people also focused in on stereotypes of masculine women.  Often \nthese representations are in direct contrast to feminine men. For example, the participants \ndescribe these manly women as \nYOUTH A.  They are more manly and they make them have guys clothing. \n(Focus Group Session Five 2017) \n \nYOUTH B.  If you're a lesbian then you have to be like working on cars and \nhaving a giant dog and wearing flannel. (Focus Group Session Six 2017) \n \nYOUTH C.  Oh, South Park. There are lesbians that are super stereotypical. They \nwear flannel and talk really deep. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nYOUTH D.  Short hair. They wear boots and they're just hormonally meaner, in a \nsense. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nYOUTH E.  Very butch. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \nPenelope, one of the case-study interviewees, uses this stereotype as a bouncing off point \nin describing her own identity.  She stated, “Lesbians are often very butch and mechanics \nand whatever, which is the opposite for me because I'm very girly” (Penelope 2017).  She \nalso describes recognizing her own sexuality while watching Orange is the New Black; \nnot because of the stereotypical masculine representations in prison, but rather due to the \nfeminine women’s representation.  She sees her sexuality and identity as something that \npushes against the stereotypical model. \n  \n \n53 \nComic Trans-Individuals \n Another common and notable stereotype that the focus group brought up involved \nthe transgender community.  Specifically, the young people brought attention to the \ncomic relief created when a male-to-female transgender individual is seen in public.  \nOften, as the young people observe, the interactions with the trans-character is built with \nstock responses to a deep voice in contrast to a feminine physique, make-up, and \nclothing.  One participant stated,  \nYOUTH: Any show where they show a trans-woman in the stereotypical drag \nsense, you know what I mean?  Like always kinda make it a gag out of like, they \nare turned around with the long hair and they turn around and they have like a \nreally deep voice.  I don't like that. (Focus Group Session Three 2016) \n \nThe site gag of the back of an individual looking female and then the voice or front side \nof the character as more masculine raised red-flags in young people in another focus \ngroup as well.   \nYOUTH: I saw this TV show, and I know this is offensive but, usually when I see \na trans person on TV or when my parents are watching a TV show, they portray it \nas a comedy.  I know this TV show my parents used to watch, it had a transgender \ncharacter and it was male to female, but it looked more manly, like their original \ngender, to like mock them basically. (Focus Group Session Five 2017) \n \nThe comic sight-gag of a man in women’s clothing is not new yet is problematic when it \nis layered on the transgender community.  The transgender character is a threat to typical \nideas of masculinity and femininity and this mockery is a means to even the expectations.  \nIt may also be possible that this type of representation is to build some understanding for \nthe trans-community.   \n  \n \n54 \nOversexualization \nAccording to one of the focus group members, oversexualization impacts the \nrepresentation of committed queer relationships and, in particular, the bisexual \ncommunity.   \nYOUTH: Like if they are bisexual or anyone who is into more than one kind of \ngender, they are like promiscuous or they have them as like people who like sleep \naround.  It's hard to have someone who is attracted to more than one gender and \nhave them in a committed relationship the entire show.  They are usually like the \nfriend who sleeps around. (Focus Group Session Two 2016) \n \nThis stereotype extends to outside of the bisexual community.  This shows up in different \nways.  The first is by the queer character hitting on his/her straight friends.  One of the \nfocus group participants stated, \nYOUTH: I think the traditional way for indicating that a character is bi or gay or \nlesbian, is by having them constantly hitting on people of that gender.  Like \nthrowing in your face, like “Hey I'm gay and hitting on every guy on the \nshow.”  So, I don't think that's realistic at all.  Not everybody hits on \neverybody.  Like I don't hit on every girl that I see.  It's like not a thing that \nhappens. (Focus Group Session Six 2017) \n \nAgain, the young people brought up Kurt from Glee as a particularly strong example.  \nDuring the course of the series, Kurt developed crushes on his straight teammate / later \nstep-brother, Finn, and on several other members of the New Directions.  For young, \nstraight, homophobic viewers, this reinforces the anxiety that, in particular, gay men will \ntake advantage of others.  Penelope, one of the case study participants, highlighted this \nconcern when she said, “another stereotype for gay men is just that they're obsessed with \nsex, so like more conservative people are like, oh, they're going to be just man-whores \nand molest our children or whatever because all they can think about is sex” (Penelope \n2017).  The promiscuity, oversexualizing, and lack of self-control portrayed on television \n  \n \n55 \nnegatively affects perceptions of the gay community.  However, I also agree with \nFrederick Dhaenens, who argues that the act of teens having sexual desire is actually a \ncounter-narrative to a non-sexualized, neutered queer figure.  He states, “The \nrepresentation of gay teens having sexual desires and/or being sexually active becomes \nsignificant as a counter-narrative to the gay teen as innocent, vulnerable, or desexualized” \n(2012, 314). By the producers showing adolescent characters making sexual choices, they \namplify their perceived agency for the audience, reminding the viewer they too have \nagentic choices in their own sexuality. \n The young people in the focus groups also saw this stereotype showing up in \nfemale portrayals.  In particular, the young people latched onto how two women kissing \nis considered attractive, while two males kissing is considered disgusting.  This \ndifference is highlighted with women seen as sex objects.  Focus group participants \npointed out that, “I would say they are usually portrayed as sex objects.  I've seen movies \nlike that” (Focus Group Session Five 2017).  Another young person stated,  \nYOUTH: They don't have girls because they don't know how to have girls and not \noversexualize them…And I feel that as a whole, we are still uncomfortable with \nfemale sexuality because it's like a shtick whenever girls like other girls and it's \nlike an experiment.  They're never actually gay. (Focus Group Session One 2016) \n \nThe show Orange is the New Black, one participant pointed out, is breaking that \nstereotype.  She stated, “Just the idea, ‘oh two girls’ but like in Orange is the New Black, \nit's not so much sexualized, it's just more part of them being a human.  They just aren't \nstraight.  They also have normal human problems” (Focus Group Session Six 2017).  \nTelevision shows have the power to challenge these stereotypes and, when they do so, \nthey are recognized and appreciated. \n  \n \n56 \nTheme #4:  Narratives Frame the Possibilities: Gays in Space \nDuring my focus group sessions with the participants, we noticed an unusual \nstereotype pattern: gender-queer characters are presented as being from outer space.  In \neach focus group session, we talked about where they see lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and queer characters.  While the bulk of the ideas put forth were about gay \nand lesbian characters, we often thought long and hard about gender queer, non-binary \ncharacters.  Young people definitely noted their absence.  Rose and Amelie, in the \nseventh focus group stated:  \nROSE.  I would also like to see more representation of people who aren't gay but \nare bi or trans or pans or polyamorous – anything that's just not gay or \nstraight. I want some more –  \nINTERVIEWER.  More diversity of –  \nAMÉLIE.  Or more nonbinary characters, too. I feel like that's definitely an \nunexplored thing. The gay thing is now being done a little bit more, but there \nare no nonbinary characters hardly at all.  (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nSo, young people are noticing the absence and wanting more representation of these \ncommunities.  The thing is they are showing up…just in some unexpected places: outer \nspace.   \nWhere non-binary and gender queer characters do show up is in cartoons and \nscience fiction shows.  Ann-Jordan, a young poly-amorous person, also enjoys the \nvoyages of the starship Enterprise.  In particular, she attached more to the progressive and \nopen tone of the show. \nANN-JORDAN.  I like sci-fi like Star Trek and stuff. More progressive shows.  \nINTERVIEWER.  Okay. So, like Star Trek: Next Generation? \nANN-JORDAN.  Yeah. \nINTERVIEWER.  I'm a Star Trek fan myself. Which one's your favorite? \nANN-JORDAN.  Next Generation. Definitely.  \n  \n \n57 \nINTERVIEWER.  Next Generation? Okay. And what is it that you like about \nthose shows? You said, \"progressive.” What does that mean to you?  \nANN-JORDAN.  Yeah. They're definitely so progressive because – can we talk \nabout how there's men in dresses and it wasn't even a weird thing? And they \nhad the very first interracial kiss on television ever. That show is just amazing.  \n[Pause]  \nANN-JORDAN.  I've been watching a lot about space and stuff. Because, you \nknow. Gays and space. I don't know.  \nINTERVIEWER.  Expand that for me. Gays and space.  \nANN-JORDAN.  I don't know. Space is just so gay. I don't know. I think that the \nspectrum of sexuality and gender is eternal. There's no beginning or start \nbecause it's so fluid. And then space is like infinity and there's no beginning or \nstart. (Ann-Jordan 2017) \n \nThere are intriguing moments in this interchange.  First, Ann-Jordan sees Star Trek \nreflecting back the “spectrum of sexuality and gender” identities.  Science fiction allows \nthe viewers and show-creators to go on a journey together that is not limited by the \ncultural confines of contemporary society.  Space is an endless expanse for diversity \n(Ann-Jordan 2017).  The show itself, as Ann-Jordan mentions, is also a social experiment \nwhere interracial dating and gender norms, and later same-sex relationships and other \nsocial issues, can be explored.  In an episode called “The Outcast,” Commander Riker \nmeets and falls in love with a female-identified member of androgynous race of extra-\nterrestrials.  These J’naii view the gender binary as perverted and force those who have a \nbinary gender to therapy.  The episode creators have essentially created a flipped culture \nwith a standardized non-binary gender identity and where the male/female identity \nconstruction is abnormal and in need of political and social remedy.  Incidentally, as I \ndescribe later, this flipped world was one of the youth’s suggestions about possible queer \nstorylines shows could adopt.  Recently, the science fiction/comedy television show The \nOrville explored a similar gender thread.  One of the main characters is from an alien race \n  \n \n58 \nof only males.  In the episode, “About a Girl,” he and his partner give birth to a female \nand want to kill the child as it is an abnormality for their culture.  Both of these shows \nused alien cultures to set up a metaphor for contemporary audiences to reflect on how \npeople engage with gender norms and differences. \nThe participants in the study noted some new examples that are doing similar \nthings.  The first is a television show called Steven Universe.  Here, a cartoon protagonist \nis going around the galaxy collecting non-binary, anthropomorphized gems.  The space \ngems can mate, merge, fall in love, and create new unique beings.  One focus group \nparticipant stated, “Oh, all the Crystal Gems in Steven Universe are nonbinary. \nTechnically speaking, they're mainly female oriented, but they don't identify as female. \nThere are two characters who make up one giant one and they're small little \nlesbians” (Focus Group Session Seven 2017).  Danny’s description of the show \nhighlights the trickiness in talking about non-binary subjects.  He struggles with the idea \nof appearance and embodiment (“female oriented”) versus how the characters identify or \nexpress identity.  When these non-binary characters join together, he shifts to a female \ncomparison: “they’re small little lesbians,” rather than try to explain it using non-binary \nlanguage.  While young people may understand and accept non-binary characters, they \nare still negotiating how to unpack and discuss this different character model.  Young \npeople from the sixth focus group session also highlighted Steven Universe and its focus \non love.  \nYOUTH 1.  Rebecca Sugar is just like love is love in general.  So, a lot of the \ngems, I don't want to spoil anything for you, but a lot of the gems it's really \nclear that coming together they make bigger gems and that acts as sort of a \nrelationship.   \n  \n \n59 \nYOUTH 2.   It's so good.  It's beautiful. \nYOUTH 1.  What gem is going to be the best or the most powerful.  It doesn't \nmatter if you identify as a man or a woman.  And all of the gems, except for \nSteven, are all women.  I think it's really cool.  I just like a lot about that \nshow.  (Focus Group Session Six 2017) \n \nRebecca Sugar is the creator and producer of the cartoon series.  She also worked on \nanother queer-friendly television show called Adventure Time.  These unrestricted \npossibilities resonated with the participants. \nAnother group of youth highlighted that while gender non-binary characters are a \ncomponent, they are not the primary focus of Steven Universe.  They stated, \nYOUTH 1.  The only show that I can think of where there are non-binary \nindividuals is Steven Universe and that's because they're aliens.  And even \nthere, it’s not open about it.  Rebecca Sugar, the person who made the show \nsaid ‘yo, they're not binary,’ but they never really mention it in the show; it's \njust kind of a thing. \nYOUTH 2.  Yeah and there's gay relationships there, too. \nYOUTH 1.  Yeah, they're basically in.  But they don't show like the mutual \nrelationships and I also think they don't have a specific gender for them either.  \n(Focus Group Session One 2016) \n \nThis echoes some other comments made during the focus groups.  Young people wanted \nmore representations of the LGBTQ+ community but they do not want sexuality or \ngender identity to be the only key character trait.  The young people reinforced they want \nto see people like them but they want the characters to be round and developed instead of \nflat and static.  Rebecca Sugar, as seen in Steven Universe and Adventure Time, \nunderstands there is more to a character than one’s sexuality or gender identity, reflecting \nyouth lived experiences. \n Another example of a non-binary alien came from movies.  The animated film \nHome tells the story of an alien that is stranded on earth.  Young people from the seventh \n  \n \n60 \nfocus group picked up on this discovered theme and took it to the next level: how it \nportrays non-binary human beings. \nYOUTH 1.  There's also this kid show called Home based off the movie. All these \nlittle – I don't know if I like the whole thing where they're aliens and then \nthey're nonbinary, which is the same thing as the book.  \nYOUTH 2.  Yeah, nonbinary crystals, nonbinary aliens –  \nYOUTH 3.  The thing, too – for me, I'm asexual and nonbinary. And those two \nthings are always shown as an alien or a nonhuman entity. It's like an animal \nspirit. I'm like, \"That's not what it is.\"…Just make them normal. We're normal \npeople. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nOne participant emphasizes her desire for portraying real gender identities as part of the \nhuman experience.  Another from the same focus group echoes this frustration.  She \nstates: \nYOUTH: Yeah. This isn't a show, but in the book with the asexual character that I \nwas talking about earlier, she's asexual, but she's also a literal alien and the scene \nis very other and not human. As an asexual, it's very frustrating to see that. It's \nweird if you're asexual. You must be an alien or a plant or something. It's like, \n\"Nope. I'm still a person.\" (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nWhile these shows may be doing a positive thing by introducing audiences to non-binary \ncharacters and a variety of sexual identities, by structuring them as alien, they are \nshowing that this “behavior” is also alien.  Young people just want to be seen as \n“normal.”   \nComplicating the previous three examples, Steven Universe, Adventure Time, and \nHome, is that all three are animated.  In Steven Universe and Adventure Time both \nprotagonists have light skin, closely aligning with a white racial identity.  While \nanimated, these two shows stick to the white, cis-gendered male, heterosexual principal \ncharacter. The rest of the characters are aliens and present in a variety of primarily non-\nskin tone colors like green, purple, blue, and orange.  Home has a person of color as the \n  \n \n61 \nhuman protagonist: a young girl with brown skin, curly dark hair, and hazel eyes.  Her \nalien counter-part is a light purple alien.  With all the creative potential for how an \nanimator could draw the main character, all three productions have cis-gendered, \nheterosexual human lead characters.  The animated aliens break from human conventions \nof color, shape, and size.  This opens the door for these characters to also break from \nhuman heteronormative conventions of sexuality and gender identity.  Diversity comes \nthrough the alien-other, not through the drawing of a familiar human being.   \nWhy might television executives or producers of youth content feel more \ncomfortable portraying gender queer characters in space versus on planet earth?  It might \ncome down to the more skeptical audiences, according to the participants.  Some young \npeople thought it was a way to introduce new identities to resistant audiences. \nYOUTH: Well not in a bad way, but like, people who are against gay people, they \nat least stand out and \"You're not like us.”  \"They are other creatures.\"  So, they \ncan still be watching the show.  Cuz they’re like \"I don't relate to them because \nthey're in the nether world, so I'll just keep watching the show.\"  But it's like, I \ncould be your neighbor. (Focus Group Session Two 2016) \n \nThe young people feel concerned though that the acceptance an audience member may \nfeel for a character might not translate to the actual human in their neighborhood.  This \ndistancing might make a person feel comfortable watching and at the same time not \nallowing empathy to develop for a real non-binary person because they are too different \nand unreal.   \nYouth Perceptions of Adult Choices: “What’s your motivation?” \n After hearing the young people talk about stereotypes and repeated \nrepresentations that seem to target them but do not reflect back their identities, I asked the \n  \n \n62 \nparticipants, “Why do you think the networks make the characters that way?”  Their \nanswers revealed a thoughtful complexity about the media industry and those that work \nto create it.  The participants in the second focus group had a wonderful exchange in \nresponse to my question.  It highlights conversations that happened in the other sessions, \nas well.  In several sessions, the young people did not pick out a particular network or \nproducer of a particular television show.  Instead they discuss a nebulous, collective \n“they” responsible for the creative narrative choices onscreen. \nYOUTH 1.  They probably aren't exposed to real people like that \nYOUTH 2.  Or they're trying to put queer characters in the show to have more \naudience.  Like they are vague enough or kill them off quick enough or they \nmake them a bad person so the audience that they already have don't get \nscared away.   \nYOUTH 3.  So, they can be more diverse, but at the same time not put any real \ncharacteristics on it.  So, there's a gay person, who can attract more people. \nINTERVIEWER.  I love the use of your air quotes on diverse; what do you mean \nby [uses air-quote gesture] diverse? \nYOUTH 1.  Sometimes it's like “oh, she's gay, she's white.”  Things like \"she's \nlike a lesbian, but she's still white.” \nYOUTH 3.  There's much more it than just that... \nYOUTH 2.  It's usually like one deciding factor is they are gay and they focus on \nthat and there is nothing else about them... \nYOUTH 4.  There's like no other personal conflict.  It's just they're gay and all \npeople can see.  They don't add anything to the character. \nYOUTH 1.  When they just like sprinkle gay characters in there, they are doing it \nfor a reason.  Like they are putting them in as like \"here is our gay character.\" \nYOUTH 3.  There's usually not more than one unless they are in a relationship. \nYOUTH 4.  Or it's like, when they have a gay character, they make it stand out so \nmuch that people are like \"oh yeah, he's like gay.”  Like sometimes there's a \ngirl like in real life and she is like \"Actually I'm a bisexual\" and you're like, \n\"Oh, I didn't know that\" and it's because we are like so normal and we say \nthat. (Focus Group Session Two 2016) \n \nYoung people believe queer characters are used to increase ratings and viewership.  The \nproductions drop one in to add spice to a show, perhaps a guest star or secondary \ncharacter, and then quickly remove them or simply kill them off.  It bumps up the profile \n  \n \n63 \nof the show for “bravely” talking about queer issues and they can all go back to normal.  \nAt the same time, that special episode or series gets to tap into an advertising marketplace \nwilling to support liberal representation.  As one young person said, while talking about \nModern Family, \nYOUTH: I think one reason it the show got the green light in the first place is \nbecause of like money, and that's it.  Having these kind of acceptable, normal \nportrayals of gay people and queer people in general is going to marketable to \nqueer people. So, having a niche market that you can kinda count on to fill this \ntime block to get that ad revenue, I think the drive of having a normal kind of \nshow that you can watch, that is driving them.  There is a lot of money to be made \nand just having a consistent show that just spits out episodes forever has \nconsistent viewers. (Focus Group Session One 2016) \n \nYoung people recognize the commodification of the queer representation and \nqueer/queer-friendly viewers.  What is also particularly notable is the young person’s \nemphasis on “acceptable and normal” portrayals.  These blank slates, filled with \npredictable stereotypes and character types, are what is being produced as the money-\nmaker. \nAnother pattern the young people noticed was the reliance of producers on white, \ncis-gendered, straight actors for the various roles.  This came up when discussing larger \nsocial contexts and when the young people talked about not seeing themselves onscreen.  \nThis diverse group of participants saw the use of a white racial appearance and male \ngender identity as a blank canvas and easy entry point to introduce more substantive \ntopics.  \nYOUTH 1.  Because like, for lack of a better term, it's a blank canvas, a blank \nslate so this is like our cultural norms.  It's harder for the entirety of the \npopulation to be marketed to that.  So that is the reason I think that \nhappens.  It just goes to show how I don't see myself in these shows because \n  \n \n64 \nthe problems in my family and the problems I face, they're not, there is no \ncontext being given. \nYOUTH 2.  I think it's because it's kinda a way to tip-toe into gay culture because \nmost Americans, they are ok with the white-straight dude mentality and \nchanging one of them at a time is an easy way to tip-toe into the gays. \nYOUTH 1.  Yeah so instead of like going into a whole different religion and \nethnicity and background... \nYOUTH 2.  Yeah, that would be too much... \nYOUTH 1.  Yes, but that also means that white people and men and straight are \nall the default, and that's a big problem.   \nYOUTH 2.  That's a big problem in general. (Focus Group Session One 2016) \n \nThe young people see the social calculations happening behind the camera.  As white and \ncis-gendered performers are normative and “standard,” these serve as a scaffold from \nwhich to build more complex representations.  The problem is people who do not identify \nas white, male, or gay become left out of much of the representation.   \n The participants also brought up the representation calculus that a movie studio or \ntelevision network may need to figure out if a queer production is worth sending into a \nlarger audience.  Here the social attitudes of the viewing audience are taken into \nconsideration and affect how the pieces are constructed.  According to one participant, \nYOUTH: I think because, America isn't really a market that will encourage \nmovies with LGBT characters, both economically and straight up culturally, I \ndon't think it's accepted at that point.  I think that ratings, that if you include \nLGBTQ+ characters, either get bumped up in the ratings or get more gated access \nbecause of just nature of having those characters. (Focus Group Session One \n2016) \n \nThe speaker is working through how others may view the queer community.  This \nresponse polarity came down to a boost in value (in the form of ratings) or a rejection of \nthe content.  In particular, the gating or protectionist impulse is worth noting.  Those that \ndisagree with queerness would have a negative reaction to this growing representation.  \nThis can shape the form of these representations. \n  \n \n65 \nTransforming Traditional Media \nToward the end of each focus group session, I asked the young people what they \nwould like to see in queer narratives such as television shows.  When asked this question, \nLili focused on moving beyond stereotypes, particularly with younger queer youth, \nthrough watching established queer cinema and television.  She does a lovely job setting \nup why a diversity of representations and moving beyond stereotypes are important. \nLILI: As there are more and more children that are growing up and things like \nthat, the movies that may show or interpret gay people as one way may start not \nbeing recognized as much. I think that it all has to do with teaching them. So, for \ninstance, if there’s a movie coming out, and it has to do with gay people, but it’s \nthis over exaggerated, super gay – dicks throwing around, things like that – I feel \nlike that would put in their head that kind of idea.  But, I feel like for future \ngenerations, if they wanted something more historical, have them watch Paris is \nBurning, or The Birdcage, or even RuPaul’s Drag Race, so they can see this is \nwhat it actually is like. It’s not just this movie where they’re stereotyping what \ngay communities are like. So, I think it all goes back to educating generations that \nare after us. (Lili 2017) \n \nLili focuses on educating the future while wrestling with the idea that stereotyped \nrepresentations may not be the means to that end.  Lili wants past narratives to inform \nfuture representations.  Next, I examine other ways that young people want to change \nfuture queer representations and narratives. \nBreaking the Mold \nFirst, young people want to smash the stereotypical mold of what a gay man, \nlesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer teenager should be.  One student said, “Why are \nwe always cute?  Like the most-hottest person on the show?  It's just like one type, \nthough, body-built, slim tone, that's the type.  Then there's like nothing other” (Focus \nGroup Session Three 2016).  The young people called into question the stereotypical gay \n  \n \n66 \nbody, fit and masculine, along with gay musical talents.  “I would rather see more things \nthat are not stereotypical, as in wearing a flannel or being really, really musical enhanced. \nIt would be more real and not fake” (Focus Group Session Seven 2017).  Of course, this \nis not limited to the gay male community.  “Yeah, the whole you can be a girl without \ndressing like a girl. You can be whatever without dressing a certain way” (Focus Group \nSession Seven 2017).  The young people also want round developed characters.  As one \nyoung person stated: \nYOUTH: More information and detail on the person so not like, it's not just like \n\"Oh they're gay\" or \"oh they're bisexual,” they have likings and dislikes.  Like \nthey might not like strawberry ice cream, or like maybe they like a weird show \nthat no one knows about.  Like or maybe they're Republican or yeah.  (Focus \nGroup Session Five 2017) \n \nDepth of character and reality, according to this young person, comes not from the \nstereotypes layered on or the gripping new episode with new plot twists, but rather \nconnecting with young people through their complexity.  As teenagers are complex \ncreatures with diverse backgrounds and opinions, so should the queer characters in \ntraditional media sources.  At the core, young people want characters onstage, onscreen, \nand in-text that represent and highlight the great diversity they see in their communities. \nQueer Inclusivity \nYouth want each part of the LGBTQ+ acronym to have significance and attention.  \nThey recognized that the majority of the pieces they could think of had gay men and, to a \nlesser degree, lesbian women.  Researchers agree in the unbalanced representation, \npointing out the higher volume of gay male characters, and to a lesser amount of lesbian \ncharacters, and lack of representation of other queer communities (McInroy 2015; Kelso \n  \n \n67 \n2015).  While this mainstreaming is laudable, the young people do not see themselves in \nsuch clear-cut ways.  They view sexuality and gender-identity in more fluid terms.  As a \nresult, they want to see a greater diversity of gender identities and sexualities represented.  \nOne participant built off an established identity to begin to explore feelings outside of \nthat norm.  He stated, “I would like to see a story about a kid who feels out of place with \nhow everyone else is growing up and he slowly comes to realize that he's gay but like a \ndifferent category of gay.  Like he could be queer or maybe transgender” (Focus Group \nSession Five 2017).  The speaker uses a well-understood and established identity \nstructure and is working to negotiate difference within it.  One of the case-study \nparticipants also stated: \nALICE: A lot of times the media just portrays gay people and very rarely a trans \nperson, but there’s no asexual representation. There’s no pansexual \nrepresentation. There’s no just non-binary or gender fluid representation. There’s \nnone of that. It’s just the very like “there are gay people who are homosexual” and \nthat’s it. That’s kind of the portrayal that we’re seeing nowadays. So I think \nmoving into like – there’s all kinds of different queer people. That would be cool. \n(Alice 2017) \n \nAlice addresses a feeling presented by the majority of focus group members; they want a \ndiversity of sexualities, gender-identities, and sexual/affectual orientations. \nThe young people also wanted more representation of people that are aromantic, \nor not interested in romantic relationships at all.  As queer characters are often offered in \nterms of being a boyfriend or girlfriend, those youth that do not identify this way are left \nwith no representation or role models of how a non-relationship existence could work.   \nYOUTH: Something I miss also is seeing people who are aromantic. We just live \nin such a relationship-oriented world, so it is weird for people to talk about \nasexuality. The idea of not even wanting a romantic relationship is just so foreign \nto so many people that I wish it was explored more in the media, to say, “You can \n  \n \n68 \nbe perfectly happy and not want to have a romantic relationship or a sexual one, \neither.” (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nAnother participant in the same focus group picked up on that idea and took it further: \ndiscussing the range of intimacy options that are not presented onscreen.  “Or people, like \nmyself, who are asexual but not aromantic. So, wanting a romantic relationship but not \nwanting a sexual partnership, that's another thing that's unexplored” (Focus Group \nSession Seven 2017).   \nFinally, the young people wanted to see more non-binary options.  As I indicated \nearlier, they want to see people they do not see normally.  They want to use the \nrepresentations to not only represent their views on gender but to show it to others.  In a \nway, it serves an educational function as well.  The participants want “People that don't \nfit the binary; I am female or I'm male, or trans, or if you identify somewhere between” \n(Focus Group Session One 2016), “or like people that are on the binary but don't act \nwithin the standards of that binary.  Like…a guy who is really into make-up” (Focus \nGroup Session One 2016).  The youth also want these options to be portrayed as \n“normal” and acceptable.  These non-binary individuals should not be seen as freakish or \nstrange, but rather as an actual option.  Also, they want more representations with poly-\namorous relationships.  “With the non-binary thing, not to be portrayed as sexual others \nbut as real people.  I also wanted to include like more bisexuality and pansexuality and \npoly-amory to like an actual thing not just one dude marrying a bunch of women.  It can \nbe an inclusive, tri-relationship” (Focus Group Session Three 2016).  In fact, queer \nnormalization came up throughout the research. \n  \n \n69 \nIntersectional Humans \nThe youth participants also expressed that queer representational works should be \nbroadened to include characters of multiple skin tones.  Identity, representations onstage, \nand action cannot be limited to one particular demographic, race, religion, or background. \nJosé Esteban Muñoz encourages a strategy for negotiating the public sphere that is “not \nmonocausal or monothematic, one that is calibrated to discern a multiplicity of \ninterlocking identity components and the ways in which they affect the social” (Muñoz \n1999, 9).  The young people, along with researchers (McInroy 2017), noticed how \nwhiteness is the standard model for queer characters and want that to change.  The \nparticipants wanted characters from “various cultures.  They need culture in \nmovies…And like, culture with race.  Like not only white kids are gay” (Focus Group \nSession Three 2016).  This would also match the actual queer demographics in the United \nStates.  When only one identity characteristic is represented, people tend to grab onto \nsexual orientation and then default to “standard white kid” or, as Muñoz describes it, “the \nnormativity of whiteness in North American gay culture” (Muñoz 1999, 9).  The young \npeople are ready to see a greater diversity onscreen. \nChapter Conclusions \n A narrative analysis approach to the data revealed a strong focus on representation \nand identity development.  Four themes emerged from the data.  Individual youth \ndescribed awareness of their sexuality and gender identity at an early age and often found \nsingle character representations in television shows to be an “a-ha” moment.  From a \nwider-angle, focus group participants expressed not seeing themselves in traditional \n  \n \n70 \nmedia primarily through limited racial, ethnic, religious, gender-identity, and sexual \norientation representations. They are aware of the media using stereotypes to create \ncharacters, a key component of narrative, based on inaccurate parameters.  A final theme \nexamined the limited narrative gender representation options to treating non cis-gendered \nindividuals as non-human aliens.  Finally, the youth expressed a longing for characters \nthat look like them.  These youth are looking for representations that break the set molds \nof what a queer should look like.  This includes breaking gender norms and sexual \norientation expectations, moving away from narratives filled with only gay men and \nlesbian women, and approaching identity representation through a more spectrum-based \nunderstanding of gender and sexuality.  The next chapter further unpacks the youth focus \ngroup and case study data around the issues of accuracy and youth information-finding \ntechniques. \n  \n  \n \n71 \nCHAPTER THREE: PLOT ACCURACY AND FINDING INFORMATION \nYoung people are searching for information about how they fit into a community, \nabout how interact with others, and how to make sense of the world around them.  This \nrelates to the next theme emerging from the youth focus groups and case studies: learning \nabout queer communities and embodying gender identity and sexual orientation through \nnarratives.  While previous research highlights the significance traditional media plays in \nyouth learning (McInroy 2017; Bond 2015), my study indicates a greater attention to \nonline information and user-created new media.  In contrast to television and other \ntraditional media, the Internet and new media forms provide more complex information \nand highlight youth-created content for other young people facing similar issues.  Yet, \nnormative traditional media persists as the dominant provider of LGBTQ+ narratives.  Im \nmy study, more young people listed and described queer characters and storylines from \ntelevision shows than online sources indicates.  I explore youth queer narratives through \nthe following related research questions: \n• How are queer narratives constructed in traditional media and new media? \n• How are queer narrative storylines understood to represent or not represent youth \nrealities?  What is realistic or accurate to young people? \n• Where do young people learn about queerness? \nTo answer these questions, I examine social construction through narrative and \nnormativity, explore the youth-identified tropes and plot structures, and highlight youth \nsolutions to changing traditional media. Finally, I discuss a shift to online information \nand new media use to learn about queer communities.  While Chapter 2 focused on \n  \n \n72 \nnarrative through character, this chapter focuses on narrative through plot.  Also uniting \nthis chapter is the young people’s search for accuracy in youth queer narratives and the \nprocess of learning about their own queer existence. \nNarrative as Social Construction \nNarratives are significant because they can construct the social reality and schema \nyoung people face.  As traditional mass media and its contained narratives, are \ntransmitted from the satellite to the digital screen, social, political, ethical, and emotional \nmessages about what is normal spread with it.  These beliefs slowly become normalized.  \nThis normalization occurs in part due to schema.  Schema are structures for \nunderstanding the constructed world around us.  Piaget’s Schema theory involves the \nmeaning surrounding a word.  Words do not only have a socially agreed upon dictionary-\nbased definition, but also the various surrounding meanings, connotations, loaded signals, \nsocial evaluations, etc.  I agree these schemes play a significant role in understanding the \nworld around us because we are limited by our frames of reference and the ideas \npresented to us.  Narrative has the potential to expose young people to new ways of life.  \nFor example, the word “gay” has a standard definitions that one might expect involving \nhappiness or a sexual/affectual attraction of one male to another.  The schema around that \nword involves the socially constructed meanings from the media, influences from social \nrelationships on that concept, and our inner feelings about the content.  The schema help \nus understand new concepts and to interact with existing ones.  However, we are also \nguided by our inner feelings and desires.  While a young man may not know the term \n  \n \n73 \n“gay,” he recognizes an inner affectual/sexual desire for other men.  The impulse is there \nand the schema help make sense of that impulse. \nGender schema are formed from personal experience, including exposure to the \nmedia.  Television can activate and then reinforce gender schemata that are already \nstereotyped (Nathanson et al. 2002).  These gender roles can be expanded to how young \npeople perceive their sexual orientation and gender.  “Stereotyped television can shape \nchildren’s beliefs about gender roles…gender appropriateness of occupations and their \nown career goals, attitudes toward the gender appropriateness of certain traits and \nbehaviors” (Nathanson et al. 2002, 923).  I agree with Amy Nathanson et al. that \ntelevision can reinforce gender expectations, particularly when built from stereotypical \nrepresentations, as discussed in the previous chapter.  The narratives affect the schemas \nconnected to gender identity, and in turn affect how young people view queerness and \nbeing “normal.” \nNormativity \n“Normal” was a concept that came up during several focus groups and case study \ninterviews.  In order to unpack what the young people may mean when they discuss \nnormal behavior, I need to unpack heteronormativity and homonormativity.  \nHeteronormativity reifies the heterosexual lifestyle and often includes pressures for \nmarriage, raising children, purchasing a house, and sticking to traditional gender roles.  \nHomonormativity reifies the homosexual lifestyle toward producing a “good” version of \na queer individual, often rooted in neoliberal heteronormative desires for couples raising \nchildren and owning a home (Duggan 2002; Herman 2003; Yep and Elia 2012; \n  \n \n74 \nPapacharissi and Fernback 2008).  As Didi Herman (2003) indicates, homonormativity is \nestablishing expectations for a normal gay lifestyle, often white, that privileges a narrow \nsubset of the queer population.  “Homonormativity presents ‘out’ ways of looking that \nare rooted in lesbian and gay subcultures” (144).  Homonormativity can also be seen in a \nnormalized gay talent for making over people as in Queer Eye for the Straight Guy \n(Papacharissi and Fernback 2008), and with monogamous queer couples holding \nheteronormative gender roles while maintaining pristine middle-class homes (Yep and \nElia 2012).  It can include the interest in the arts, penchant for working out, and going to \ngay bars.  Both heteronormativity and homonormativity ascribe behaviors, lifestyles, \nrepresentations, and language to be preferred over others.  These privilege one type of \nhuman over another, if one does not fit the normativity mold.  Lauren Berlant and \nMichael Warner were the first to describe the reification of certain heterosexual behaviors \nand expectations amongst a society. These norms are everywhere and impact a variety of \nsocial expectations, institutions, and family structures.  They go on to state that \nheteronormativity is:  \nmore than ideology, or prejudice, or phobia against gays and lesbians; it is \nproduced in almost every aspect of the forms and arrangements of social life: \nnationality, the state, and the law; commerce; medicine; and education; as well as \nin the conventions and effects of narrativity, romance, and other protected spaces \nof culture. (Berlant and Warner 1998, 554-555) \n \nHeteronormativity is a pervasive and ingrained element that must be recognized, \nanalyzed, and explored in order to open up new possibilities of identity construction.  \nHerman extends the definition further by emphasizing how heteronormativity encourages \n  \n \n75 \nactive heterosexuality (2003). The “ought-to” dynamic is even more present in traditional \nmedia. \nHeteronormativity enters traditional media through the representations of LGBT \ncharacters onscreen.  Turning our attention to representations of LGBT youth in \nparticular, the heteronormative expectations show an ostracized non-heterosexual \nindividual being bullied, harassed, or marginalized for not conforming to the rigid sexual \nnorm.   When these depictions contain obvious differences between how non-\nheterosexual individuals and heterosexual individuals are treated, then the message to \nyoung people is that breaking the heteronormative structures is inherently dangerous.  \n“There is a comparison between themselves and straight peers who are seen to face fewer \nsocial problems, less capacity for shame, less likelihood of discrimination, and lower risk \nof being bullied” (Cover 2013, 342).  Social problems, shame, discrimination, and \nbullying are the outcomes presented for exploring non-heterosexual identities, which is \nreinforced onscreen as well. \nNormativity also limits the possible acceptable portrayals of queer individuals in \nreal-life.  One of the focus groups, in particular, observed there are certain parts of queer \nlife that are less acceptable to mainstream U.S. Americans.  These normative violations \nare outside of the “normal” range and focused on physical traits.  “Like if you take these \npeople down to gay pride, then like they're gonna have a problem with all the people with \nlike different hair and colored hair and piercings and walking around in bondage gear” \n(Focus Group Session One 2016).  These embodiments and representations violate the \nheteronormative and even homonormative structures because body modification and \n  \n \n76 \nclothing choices do not fit the heteronormative/homonormative schema of what normal \npeople should look like.  Traditional media representations have reinforced such bland \nqueer characters that small deviations from the white, middle-class, cis-gendered mold \nare challenged by real-life violations.  As Giannini states, limited representations do little \nto actually challenge heteronormativity. (2009).  Diverse representations may lead to \nmore progress and acceptance from mainstream U.S. American culture. \n When examining normativity, it is important to recognize that young people get \ntheir information from three external locations; traditional media, online information, and \nnew media.  In this chapter, I examine the traditional media’s use of plot and action to \nreinforce normativity through tropes.  I then assert that the rise of the Internet and new \nmedia forms have created stronger information resources that disrupt normativity and \nprovide a richer, diverse set of voices for youth. \nTraditional Media \nTraditional media is characterized by a higher level of hierarchical control and \nlarger networks for creation and distribution of narratives.  Adults create the traditional \nmedia narratives intended for youth.  These adult constructions try to sell a product or \nadvocate for their particular world view.  They also carry the limitations of what is \ndeemed appropriate and acceptable to large viewing audiences.   In fact, media created by \nadults for teenagers actually has a larger audience that includes pre-teens, teenagers, and \nadults (Meyer and Wood 2013).  Aware of this broad audience, media creators construct \nnarratives that appeal to a wide base.  Adults tune into stories about young people \nbecause they are longing for a look back into the past.  As Michaela Meyer and Megan \n  \n \n77 \nWood state, “Many of these narratives capitalize strongly on a sense of nostalgia, \nemphasizing both the past and future…Adult viewers can identify with the series as part \nof a nostalgic revisionist history of their own past identity structures” (2013, 438).  \nNarratives can therefore become a dramatized do-over, where adults can create more \npositive versions of the past.  While this may work for adults, young people are looking \nfor something different from traditional media representations: accuracy.  They want to \nsee themselves onscreen. \nSeeking Accuracy \n  The young people and I also discussed the accuracy of the plot and actions that \nare presented onscreen.  While truth certainly is a fluid and subjective concept, I wanted \nto see if and where they saw what they deemed as more accurate, real, or truthful.  \nSpecifically, I asked; “In these stories, what do you think are the big stories or narratives \nbeing told? Are they believable? Unbelievable? Realistic? Unrealistic? Why do you think \nthe media uses these stories or narratives?” (Appendix H: Focus Group Questions).  \nWhere they saw reality portrayed most accurately in traditional media was in the \ndepiction of the coming out narrative.  They identified and could see a real experience of \ncoming out to friends and family members. \nYOUTH 1.  The accurate part is like not telling your parents first but telling your \nbest friend when you are younger. \nYOUTH 2.  Or like it shows the troubles they go through to get accepted, but \nthere are ones where they automatically start doing all this gay stuff. \nYOUTH 3.  The one being afraid to tell your parents [is more realistic], unless it's \nlike obvious like.  Unless you are dressing like [youth name] then obviously \nyou wouldn't be with a guy so if it's like that then duh, the parents know \nbefore you say something. (Focus Group Session Four 2017) \n \n  \n \n78 \nSo the young people are identifying with the characters’ choices, the plot, in speaking \nwith peers and finding support before going to their parents.  As the coming out process \nis particularly important in a young person’s life, traditional media productions are often \nusing this as a common plot device.  However, adolescents found the reactions of the \nfictional community to be significantly different than “real life.”  Where the young \nparticipants may find acceptance or rejection, the television teenagers often only found \nacceptance. \nYOUTH: Usually they are more realistic by showing the character coming out \nand usually I've seen it like they accept them right away.  But in reality, some kids \njust face rejection.  Like when I did it, I see it as a struggle like I wish I was like \nthem in a fake world where it's easier and they like they don't face rejection right \naway.  They just face acception [sic] easily. (Focus Group Session Five 2017) \n \nIn reality, young people do not face such an easy journey.  This exclusion of the real \nstruggles can also be difficult for young people to see.  This presents their real-life \nchallenging experience as outside of the norm through the traditional media’s portrayal.  \nThe young people I spoke with do not see themselves in traditional media storylines.  \nAnother participant observed that the decisions made by young people in the show Glee \nseem to come more easily than in real life.  One participant stated: \nYOUTH: The main difference, I think, they know who they are right away and \nthere's not really any development on how they figure it out.  “Oh, I'm \nthis.”  What if they think they are gay when they are actually transgender or \nbisexual and there's no knowing right away? Like everyone else the box is \nexaggerated. (Focus Group Session Five 2017) \n \nThis young person wants complexity in representations, so that queer youth’s experiences \nhave value and voice.  When their feelings and struggles are glossed over, they recognize \nthat it is not their story anymore and it is less relatable. \n  \n \n79 \nAccurate Exemplar: The Fosters \n The Fosters frequently came up during the discussions as a positive example of a \n“real” set of characters that is showing “truth.”  This show on the ABC Family network \ncenters around a family composed of various biologic and foster children headed by a \nlesbian couple.  One of the children comes out as a gay youth and starts to tip-toe into \ndating.  The lesbian couple are mixed race and some of the children come from other \nracial backgrounds as well.  The young people saw this show as legitimate due to its \nrepresentation, as well as its dramatic (rather than comedic) form.   \nYOUTH 1.  I feel like Fosters is one of the best sort of gay shows, cuz it's \nactually legit and they're not used for comedy.  It's like a snapshot.  It gave \nmore pictures of like, they gave like the family base. \nYOUTH 2.  It gave a family type of picture instead of oversexualizing gay youth \nand stuff. (Focus Group Session One 2016)  \n \nThis focus on the family resonated with young people that see their family lives as \ndramatic and a mix of different types of people. \nAnother focus group addressed the dating relationship of the young teenager in \nThe Fosters.  They found it remarkable because not only was his sexuality not \nspecifically defined, or at least they could not remember it, and that the characters did not \nfall into a typical gay stereotype.  They stated: \nYOUTH 1.  The Fosters was pretty accurate.  \nYOUTH 2.  The one little boy who is gay or bi – I don't know if they ever –  \nYOUTH 1.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  \nYOUTH 2.  And his boyfriend for a period of time, neither of them were very \nstereotypically gay. They were very \"normal\" people. One of them was pretty \nsporty and stuff. I think it represented that anyone can be gay. It's not just one \ntype of person.  \nYOUTH 3.  Not everyone fits inside a little box.  \nYOUTH 2.  I think that's the exception, though. I feel like a lot of times the queer \npeople are portrayed by their stereotypes. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n  \n \n80 \n \nSo here, the three speakers highlight that the couple did not represent any of the \nstereotypes associated with gay men and that their sportiness moved them into the realm \nof “normal.”  And yet, the young people also recognize that The Fosters is an exception \nto the traditional media’s stereotypical constructions.  Also, it is significant that their \nconstruct of normal is a homonormative lifestyle.  The two lesbian parents raising a \nvariety of children in a home they own, in a safe suburban community, where they both \nhave nice middle-class jobs and when they are ready to date, they date someone attractive \nand it does not get too sexual.  They describe the standard model for other sitcoms, and \nyet because it has a gay character, they resonate with the piece.  Instead of leaving the \nlittle boxes behind, they just enjoy the replicated larger box.  The semantic frame is \nreplicated from heteronormative sources into a queer piece of television. \nTraditional Media Tropes \nThe young people were quick to identify the numerous queer stereotypes and \nadeptly isolated stereotypes for each piece of the LGBTQ+ spectrum.  I examine the \nnarrative through the tropes that are used.  Tropes are essentially overused thematic plot \ndevices used in a piece.  Four noteworthy tropes emerged.  These are areas that the young \npeople brought up and that deserve more focus.  These include dying lesbians, gay best \nfriends, bullying, and AIDS victims.  Each involves a series of stereotypes woven together \nin established plot devices and larger character arcs.  I examine each trope and include \nhow young people would like to see the particular trope addressed.   \n  \n \n81 \nLesbian Death \nThe first trope to be examined is lesbian death.  Young people, particular female \nparticipants, were acutely aware that their television role models kept dying.  Focus \ngroup participants made statements noting the “lesbian that always dies first” (Focus \nGroup Session One 2016).  Another young person said about queer women, “they \ndie.  The way they have queer characters in shows and movies tend to be the same in they \nhave women or people of color, they tend to be the first to die” (Focus Group Session \nTwo 2016).  Sometimes young people don’t even remember the names of the characters \nbut simply notice that the lesbians die first.  When speaking about a fantasy show on \ntelevision one participant noted, “There's these two girls in Vampire Diaries, and they \nkilled themselves in some fiery explosion but I can't remember their names” (Focus \nGroup Session Four 2017).  It is remarkable that this happens so often that the young \npeople don’t even remember the character details.  They simply recognize the presence of \na lesbian couple and the instant destruction of these role models.   \nThis trope was a large topic of conversation among the focus groups.  The \nparticipants expertly recognized the deaths were primarily occurring with lesbians and \npersons of color.  They stepped away from general assertions about LGBTQ+ death and \ninstead focused on a particular subset of the queer community.  To them, the solution is \nquite simple; stop killing them off.  When talking about ideas for what young people \nwould like to see on television, one group enthusiastically stated they wanted a “love \nstory between two women that doesn't involve someone dying” (Focus Group Session \nThree 2016).  Clearly, young people are ready for this trope to go away.  They want their \n  \n \n82 \nbeloved queer characters, and even those they just meet, to stay alive.  “It's like have a \ncutsie love story between two women that doesn't involve someone dying” (Focus Group \nSession Three 2016). They want these people to live and thrive onscreen. \nGay Best Friend \n Another strong trope in media is the gay best friend.  It is so prevalent that there is \neven a movie called GBF.  Typically, this is even more exaggerated because the character \nin question needs help from a feminine gay male.  The character needs a make-over, or \nfashion advice, or some other magical help.  One of the young people indicated, “well it \nhas been for a long time, to have a token gay best friend where like ‘where you just need \nsome line honey’, and then like it's really obnoxious” (Focus Group Session Three 2016).  \nOther participants connected this trope to race and gender.   \nYOUTH 1.  The white feminist wants the one gay best friend and they want that \nbest friend.  \nYOUTH 2.  I think what was said really sums it up, like the idea of the gay best \nfriend just like, it's a little token character to make all the other white straight \ncharacters to feel good about themselves. (Focus Group Session One 2016) \n \nAs the student indicated, perhaps this character allows the straight viewing audience to \nsee the value of the gay male community.  These are the hair dressers, fashion stylists, \nand confidantes that every straight girl must collect.  Additionally, these characters rarely \nare sexual.  The gay best friend does not need his own boyfriend or engage in his own \nromantic interests, because he is there to serve the female friend.  This commodification \nof gay people can be seen in television shows like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and \nfollowed into movies like My Best Friend’s Wedding.  The gay best friend trope \n  \n \n83 \nhighlights the abstract value and comfort that a neutered gay male can have for a female \ncharacter. \nRegarding plot arcs, the youth long for gay people to be more than supporting \nfriends.  For example, “the gay person would totally – or the gay or like anyone on the \nLGBTQ+ spectrum would obviously not be the token best friend. Because that's really \nimportant not to do” (Ann-Jordan 2017).  The gay best friend trope, according to Ann-\nJordan, makes gay people seem like they are always friendly and always ready to drop \neverything to have fun.  She, along with others, want to see characters that do not fit in \nthis trope.   \nBullying \n Another dominant trope is queer bullying.  Queer individuals are victimized by \ntheir bullies through physical violence, verbal assaults, discrimination, and harassment.  \nMy previous research, as well as the works of Giannini (2009), van de Water (2012), and \nMarshall (2010), highlight this trope in television in shows like Dawson’s Creek, Queer \nas Folk, and Glee, as well as Theatre for Young Audience pieces like The Wrestling \nSeason, fml: How Carson McCullers Saved My Life, and The Children’s Hour.  In \naddition to those works, the young people also identified the show Shameless as a site of \nqueer youth bullying in television (Focus Group Session Two 2016), and in non-English \nspeaking pieces, as well. \nYOUTH:  So like I'm Mexican and my mom likes watching in Spanish, and there \nwas this one where there was a gay couple.  And you couldn't even tell they were \ngay, so it was like when they announced it, you were like \"Oh whoa!,” and then in \nthe episode this guy was just walking and then this gay started to say slurs to him \nand stuff like that and they got in a big fight and then the guy is starting to get, \n  \n \n84 \nlike accuse him of stuff, so he couldn't adopt children, so it was kinda like \nbullying. (Focus Group Session Two 2016) \n \nBullying came up in a list of struggles that are common trends in narrative plot devices.  \n(Focus Group Session Three 2017; Focus Group Session Four 2017).  Gilad Padva, \nconfirms the prevalence of this trope in her research, stating that \nThe bullying and bashing of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer persons \n(particularly adolescents) have become common themes in popular \ncommunications of the 1990s and 2000s, including film, television, magazines, \nfiction, children’s books, comics, popular music, gay press, advertisements, \nInternet websites and pornography. (2007, 105-106) \n \nClearly, this trope can be found throughout youth queer narratives, and its impact is \nstrikingly significant. \nThe bullying trope and queer victimization works to minimize queer rights and \nencourage further acts of violence; normalizing the experience for both the oppressor and \nthe oppressed. \nThese media representations reflect diverse attitudes towards sexual, homophobic, \nand heterocentric abuse, harassment, and physical attack of GLBTQ \nsubjectivities: from condemning sexual intolerance to eroticization of bullying \nacts; from sophisticated deconstruction of degrading hegemonic cultural practices \nto over encouragement of violence towards sexual minorities. (Padva 2007, 105-\n106) \n \nAdditionally, by presenting queer relationships and queer identities as victims, the trope \nre-affirms the power of heteronormativity in media representations.  A reliance on tropes \nthat present “troubled, gay youth, coming out/outing, and homophobia work to reinscribe \nheteronormativity by stigmatizing same-sex-attracted young people in relation to their \nheterosexual peers” (Giannini 2009, 51).  In other words, traditional media present \n  \n \n85 \nbullying as a normal queer experience and non-normative sexuality or gender identity as \nlesser than the heteronormative standard. \nAIDS Victim \nAnother trope is the gay AIDS victim.  Several television shows since the late \n1980s have explored this issue through a token gay male that has picked up HIV.  One of \nthe focus group participants stated, “well usually I've seen a gay stereotype that gay \ncharacters have AIDS and all that and that kinda disturbs me cuz they're assuming that all \ngay people have AIDS.  And I just don't like it cuz it's rude and offensive” (Focus Group \nSession Five 2017).  This also came up in the second focus group, this time focusing on \nthe reactions of others.  Here the stereotyped character is excluded due to his disease.  \n“There are a couple of AIDS storylines where everyone like shuns them cuz they are like \ndiseased or whatever” (Focus Group Session Two 2016).  When it is set forth as a pattern \nand stereotype it not only minimizes the disease but also treats it as an eventuality.  In \nparticular, recent shows like Brothers and Sisters, RuPaul’s Drag Race, and How to Get \nAway with Murder use an HIV diagnosis as a surprise character trait that just comes with \nbeing gay.   \nTropes Effects on Youth \nWith each of these tropes, the young people recognized their existence and \nprevalence in traditional media.  This highlights that they are more than passive narrative \nconsumers and can actively uncover traditional media practices.  However, they also \nexplored the impact these tropes can have on an audience.  I asked the participants how \nsomeone who may not have queer friends, a supportive community or peer network, or \n  \n \n86 \n‘easy’ exposure may view these representations.  One of the insightful moments from the \nsecond focus group tackled this subject.  \nYOUTH 1.  False representation, it changes their mindset, values, they assume a \nlot.   \nYOUTH 2.  Especially with gay men in the show, they'll see they're like normally \nfeminine and then if they come across someone who is feminine, they'll just \nassume they're gay, and not even like ask them.  They could very well be \nstraight, but they just, they're just represented in that stereotypical way. \nYOUTH 1.  How we see in media that we are just so cheery and fun, some people \nare just like \"gay people are so happy\" they're like so cheery.  I want to have \none as my best friend, but it's like sometimes I like don't even want to talk to \nyou.  Like get-away. (Focus Group Session Two 2016) \n \nThe young people point out that if the representations on television do not match the \nlimited experience of the viewer, the viewer may take what they see as truth.  For \nexample, “gay men must be feminine because that’s who they were portrayed, and no one \nis showing me any different, so it’s true.”  The problem is this truth has been constructed \nby traditional media producers and relies on stereotypes and tropes.  Real queer young \npeople are then left dealing with media viewers that take stereotype for fact and believe \nthe queer youth is just waiting to be his/her best friend.  The focus group participants are \npointing out that narratives built off stereotypes and tropes are providing misleading, \ninaccurate information to the viewing audience. \nTransforming Traditional Media \nIn asking young people about what they wished to see in future queer narratives, \nthey also discussed what they would fix about current traditional media forms.  Some of \nthe suggestions they offer align with Giannini’s suggestions from her research into queer \nyouth theatre.  She offers that to break away can include showcasing and representing \nqueer desires, creating characters within and outside sexual and gender categories, and \n  \n \n87 \nshowing “fun in homosexuality; communities that embrace homosexuality; and the \nextension of queerness beyond able-bodied, white, middle class males” (2010, 6).  The \nyoung people echo some of these ideas and also come up with some wonderful new ones \nof their own.  These include: encouraging queer artists to take on queer character roles, \ndecentralizing token queer experiences from queer character storylines, presenting strong \nqueer relationships, and highlighting realistic consequences to abuse. \nQueer Artists Wanted \nThe young people had some strong things to say about the performers presenting \nthese characters.  Young people want to see queer individuals in queer roles and \nappreciate when it is done well.  “It's really cool when they put actual actors and actors, \nthat match their selves” (Focus Group Session Five 2017).  The young people believed \nthat actors can put on a stronger performance if they have actually dealt with the issues \nthe characters are struggling through.  One participant felt strongly about this issue, as \nevident when she stated: \nYOUTH: Stop having straight people play queer people!  Like let's have actual \ngay people and trans people or anything like that, play like those roles…Like if \nsomeone who has never been in a queer situation, so they don't know what \nactually happens and they don't know how it feels so whatever, the producers tell \nthem to do they're like, so this is how it's actually, so I'm gonna just do that.  But \nlike a queer person, they're like, “I've been in this situation, it's not like this, so let \nme how it actually was.” (Focus Group Session Three 2016) \n \nAdditionally, these queer actors are strong role models for young people.  This also \nextends to queer celebrities.  According to Craig et al., young people look up to “admired \ncelebrity role models because they provide a certain sense of comfort and \nstrength…providing participants with positive representations that they could emulate” \n  \n \n88 \n(2015, 264).  They see a sense of truth and genuineness in representations when it comes \nfrom experience. One participant stated:  \nYOUTH: People talk about Sense 8…I think it should be queer people involved in \nwriting queer characters as well, because the directors of The Matrix, the \nWachowskis, one of them is a trans-woman.  So she is helping, like directly in \ncharge of Sense 8, and that's why the characters are really believable and realistic. \nThey are actually part of people's lives and are being appropriated and having \nactually first-hand experience both in acting and like in creation of it is leading to \na lot of crazy things happening. (Focus Group Session Three 2016) \n \nSeeing real queer individuals exploring queer issues opens the door for youth to do the \nsame.  Additionally, the participants see value in character representation by someone \nwho has first-hand experience with queer issues.   \nThe Normal Queer \n These young people want queerness to be accepted and to feel like they are part of \nthe larger society.  In this case, when the youth refer to queer being normal, they did not \nexpress changing their lives to fit a more heteronormative or homonormative standard.  \nInstead, they want society to shift to recognize that being queer is okay and that it should \nbe accepted.  The young people want to be treated just like everyone else in that their \nqueerness is not the sole factor of their existence.   \nYOUTH: I don’t really know. I think a lot of times the media tries to portray \nqueer people and their struggles, but they don’t just want a queer person to be \nnormal…They don’t just have a queer person just being a queer person as just like \na normal thing. They have to turn it into the focus of a problem and a conflict and \nlike a resolution to that. But they never just have a queer person just there. It’s \nlike there are so many straight characters, but it’s not like the plot is focused on \nthem being straight and their struggles, not really, as a straight person. It’s just \nlike they’re straight, cool, here’s all these adventures that they go on. (Focus \nGroup Session Three 2016) \n \n  \n \n89 \nZol, and other focus group participants expressed they want people, through narratives, \n“To actually open up my eyes and see the perspective that gay people are just like us, and \nthey deserve the same rights that straight people do” (Focus Group Session Six 2017).  \nThere is some gray space to be explored between the way the queer community should \nact and how it should be treated.  The young people seem to be focusing on the treatment \nby others where queer activists and theorists focus on queer behaviors and ways of \nidentifying.  Either way, it is interesting to see how the young people try to thread this \ntricky needle. To begin, young people want to be treated the same.  One participant \nindicated she wanted “maybe like a storyline where their relationships and where you can \nsee that their relationships are like everybody else’s, they're not different in any way.  \nThey're just like a regular, straight relationships” (Focus Group Session Three 2016).  \nThe young people want to belong and to be treated the same. \nThe young people also wanted this normal-ness to extend to the daily life of the \nprotagonist or queer character.  “Just make them normal. We're normal people” (Focus \nGroup Session Seven 2017).  This would show up, in particular, in sitcom environments.  \n“It'd be like, ‘that show contains a gay person just like any normal thing.’ And I think it'd \njust be normal…like any day life.  For example, like Parks and Rec. Just continue with \nwhatever their life is” (Ann-Jordan 2017).  The young people often fell back on sitcom \nanalogies to express the types of shows they wish had more queer characters.   \nALICE:  I feel like you could really make it just like any TV show, like The \nOffice or Parks and Rec or just like any sort of show that just has characters in it \njust going about their normal lives, just like they’re queer, I guess. I don’t think \nthat it necessarily has to be something that is like a huge deal. (Alice 2017) \n \n  \n \n90 \nAgain, this was built on being seen as people doing customary daily activities, \ndecentralized from the queer experience or expectations that queers live differently. \nNext, the young people want artists to improve the plot and action of the \nnarratives.  At the core, youth wanted storylines that challenge the dominated \nheteronormative, trope-based narratives.  First, the participants see gender identity and \nsexual identity as an inborn part of their existence.  On the nature/nurture debate, they are \nclearly on the nature or biological root side of how people become queer.  That said, \nyoung people still want more depth and more to the characters’ lives than this one facet.   \nYOUTH: Yeah, and I think less of a focus on it being such a struggle for that \ncharacter to be queer and more of like, ‘That's just who they are.’ Straight \ncharacters, there's never this struggle of them being straight. ‘It's so hard…Oh no! \nWhat am I going to do?’ It's very different how queer characters are portrayed. \nTheir whole shebang is that they're queer and it's a struggle. It would be really \nnice to just see a character who is queer and also likes to read and is in the chess \nclub and does all this other stuff. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nTila highlighted how sexuality really should be a secondary character trait and not the \nmain focus.  She does not want to watch shows just because there is a queer character.  \nInstead it should just be a fact of life in the larger mosaic of a character’s development.  \n“I'd rather be like ‘yeah okay’ like if I'm excited about it [the show] it's because it's two \ncharacters that I really like.  It should have nothing to do with the fact they are gay” \n(Focus Group Session Six 2017).  Young people want their ways of life to be treated with \nrespect, just like the heterosexual, cis-gendered majority. \nMeaningful Companionship \nThe young people also see how queer individuals are often put in a relationship \ncontext with other queer people.  In other words, if there is going to be more than one \n  \n \n91 \nqueer person, he/she should be in a relationship with the other queer individual.  The \nyouth participants want relationships that are more than just sex.  The youth wanted to \nshow more queer friendship onscreen.   \nYOUTH: In a lot of shows I've watched, if there is one gay character and they are \njust by themselves, and they introduce another gay character, they end up being in \na relationship.  And I'd like to see gay characters be in platonic relationships, \nplatonic love, supportive instead of being their only option in life.  They're able to \nbe friends, even though they're the only characters that are gay. (Focus Group \nSession Three 2016) \n \nThese participants want traditional media that shows characters finding supportive peers \nthat are not trying to get laid.  Queer youth need to see other queer youth as supportive \npeers and not just relationship opportunities. \nThat being said, the young people did want to feel like there is someone out there \nfor them to care about and to have those feelings returned.  Some participants expressed \nunease with romantic narratives because they do not connect with these heterosexual \nstories.  As one focus group member stated, “I personally don't like watching romantic \ncomedies, because it's like the same thing over and over again with the same people, but I \nthink I would watch it was with queer characters, the same kind of like cheesy \nlove” (Focus Group Session Three 2016).  The queer youth in my study want to be swept \naway by narratives they can see themselves in, with romantic relationships on screen that \nlook like themselves.  This interchange between case study participants Zol and Tila \nreally highlight this point. \nZOL.  Well, love stories in general make me believe that there’s somebody out \nthere waiting. If it would have to be a gay story, it shows me that… \nTILA.  There’s someone gay waiting for me. \nINTERVIEWER.  I see a big smile on your face, so is that a hope? \nTILA.  Pretty much, yeah. \n  \n \n92 \nZOL.  But, it also makes me not feel alone because I know that there’s people out \nthere with the same sexuality as me, and so, I feel accepted – especially if a \nbig moving picture did a movie. It’s like, “Wow, they accept people like that, \ntherefore I feel accepted.” (Tila 2017) \n \nSexual orientation or gender identity can be secondary or tertiary points of conflict, not \nalways the core message presented.  When youth audiences (both queer and straight) see \nLGBTQ+ characters obsessing over LGBTQ+ issues, they learn that the only people who \nreally care about these issues are the ones going through them and that little common \nground lies between queer and straight people.  How can we expect youth to see diverse \nexperiences, when all they see are gay kids obsessing about gay issues?   \nWe’ve Got 99 Problems and Being Queer Ain’t One \nIt is also significant that the young people expressed that queerness need not be \nthe centerpiece of the show or the characters’ lives.  Echoing other participants, Alice \nwent on to state: \nALICE: I think it’s good to make it clear to the audience when a character is \nqueer, but I don’t think that the character’s queerness should be the center of the \nstoryline…We’re not weird or other like alien because we’re queer. We all have \nthe same problems. We can’t find our matching sock. Our coffee got cold and \nnow it’s gross. Like we have the same problems as everybody else and being \nqueer might add to some of our problems, but it shouldn’t make us less of a \nperson or less normal. (Alice 2017) \n \nA different group of youth had another great interchange about this subject.  They stated: \nYOUTH 1.  It being a part of a storyline.  Having a movie where you have a gay \ncharacter but it's not the main focus.  Or like it's not necessarily a plot \npoint.  It just happens to be something brought up and then whatever.  And \nwhatever the storyline happens to be it just continues and it's not like a main \n\"Oh my god, this changes everything.” \nYOUTH 2.  Cuz it really shouldn't. \nYOUTH 1.  I think it's taken way to seriously sometimes.  Yes, it's a part of your \nidentity. \n  \n \n93 \nYOUTH 2.  It's like having hair color or eye color, it's just what they are. (Focus \nGroup Session Six 2017) \n \nWhile the previous points came up a few times during the discussions, the ideas that \ncome after were primary topics of conversation in the majority of the focus groups.   \nThe young people want to see the journey of a character, the struggles and the \nsuccess.  They do not want their representations onscreen to be sanitized or scrubbed \nclean of the dirty parts of life.  This could include “homeless kids that don't have their \nfamily anymore because they are gay” (Focus Group Session Three 2016), starting a \nshow with the character coming out and then “it would keep going and going to see how \nhis parents react to that” (Focus Group Session Five 2017), and “finding the label that fits \nyou perfectly and…accepting that is subject to change” (Focus Group Session Six 2017). \nYoung people also want narratives to address issues from people’s everyday lives.  \nHigh on this list is the conflict between one’s religion and one’s sexuality.  When \ndiscussing what youth wished they could see, one participant said, “Some of us have \nfamilies and religion to deal with that isn't like Christian and Catholic.  We have Muslim \nfamilies and Arab parents and Indian parents” (Focus Group Session Three 2016).  The \nyoung people want more variety and religious diversity.  Another group of young people \nhad an insightful interchange about religion.  They stated: \nYOUTH 1.  They could give him really religious parents, cuz in my case my \nparents are really religious, and it would be like how he can admit to himself \nhow he is the way he is and there is nothing wrong with it. \nYOUTH 2.  Like I've had a really religious friend find out that she wasn't straight, \nthat she was bisexual and it was hard for her to come out because she was \nreally religious and she had to like face a struggle like do I tell my family or \nchurch that I'm this.  Or hide it for all these years and keep it inside. \nYOUTH 3.  And if we do have religious parents, I don't want them to just \ncondemn their child, they love their kid, they LOVE their kid.  And that's why \n  \n \n94 \nI really want to see it.  I want to see the struggles between everyone and \neverything in taking everything in perspective.  Like oh we're gay, oh we are \nreligious parents and we don't like that.  They just don't know how to cope \nwith that.  I would like to see a lot more depth. (Focus Group Session Five \n2017) \n \nConsequences \nYoung people are faced with challenges at home, in their communities, and at \nschool.  With the growing global network of information and news, they are also witness \nto these stories happening across the country.  Lili shared a story of one of her friends \nwho experienced harassment in the middle of a suburb.  “I had another friend – he was \nNative American – and we were in Scottsdale when this happened, and there was this guy \nthat just kept circling the area that he was in, and then, he ended up calling him a faggot, \nand then turned the sprinklers on him” (Lili 2017).  Ozzy wanted media and narratives to \nhighlight the injustice and suffering happening to and within the trans-community.  He \nbegan by sharing his perspective on recent trans-violence.    \nOZZY: I see very little condemnation of the people that really harass and attack \nand oppress trans or queer people. Like you'd see in the news pieces – I'll go back \nto what happened with Leelah Alcorn. Because this is probably the most famous \nand usable for your purposes especially. But the news articles, there was very \nlittle serious condemnation of what she experienced with her parents. These are \nthese total abusive assholes are doing this. And this is not an uncommon thing. \nAnd there are people on social media saying these horrible, horrible things about \nit. And there's no backlash. There's no one who's actually saying – There's no \ncondemnation. There might be, \"Oh, this is horrible.\"  \n \nSo, in the article, there's point A, which is missing, which is Leelah Alcorn's \nparents are abusive lunatic assholes. Then there's point B which is Leelah Alcorn \nis transgender and extremely negatively impacted by point A.  And then there's C, \nthat point B [her gender identity] leads to Leelah Alcorn committing suicide. And \nthere's point B and there's point C. Well, there's no point A [her parents’ behavior] \nmentioned. There's no – like they mention it. But they're not saying – you never \nsee condemnation of people that are oppressing and violently attacking \ntransgender people. (Ozzy 2017) \n  \n \n95 \n \nWhen it came to offering ideas about what type of narrative he would like to see, Ozzy \nfocused on social change pieces.  He wanted the violence and disregard for queer \nindividuals to be an agent of change. \nOZZY: I want to be able to use the trans or the queer character as kind of like an \nincendiary. Kind of a tool to show what people actually go through. I don't want \nto make it the entire focus of the show. I would rather have it as the side scenes \nthat you see and have extremely volatile, extremely aggressive experiences \ntypical to what trans people experience. (Ozzy 2017) \n \nIn a notable addition, Ozzy connects his ideas about what queer narratives could be to a \nreal experience that happened at his high school.  He offers a specific plot and situation \nwith an emphasis on the point of view of the character and the reactions of the group.   \nOZZY: Like it could be – I won't name names. But there's a teacher at the school \nwho went on a 20-minute tirade that was incredibly – just totally unacceptable \nabout how mentally ill and diseased and unacceptable transgender people are. I \nwant the transgender student to be in that classroom. And I want everybody to \nhave to sit there and agonize with them as they see this person that is kind of the \nendearing second – like the endearing wingman or wing person, more \nappropriately, to the main character that they really like and appreciate just totally \nhaving their identity invalidated and being attacked in several ways. Because I'm \nextremely angry that it doesn't get shown and that it doesn't get condemned.  \n(Ozzy 2017) \n \nOzzy’s unique perspective echoes frustrations from young people in the queer \ncommunity.  They are frustrated with the way they are treated, they want others to see \ntheir experiences, and they want to see the behavior and the broader society change.   \nSocial Change \nYoung people see the advantage in narratives presenting violence, bullying, and \nother shocking situations to spark dialogue and increase empathy.  The young people \nwant narratives that shocks the viewer into action.  They hope this leads to effective \n  \n \n96 \nsocial change. “I feel like, and one of the best ways to enact change is to shock and to get \npeople to sympathize with you” (Penelope 2017).  The focus group participants and case \nstudies wanted future narratives to cause change in the world.  Padva also saw the \npotential for queer narratives to help young people.  She stated,  \nAlthough supportive fiction, cinema, popular music, printed and Internet articles \nand posters cannot replace a professional’s help for harassed and bullied GLBT \nadults and youth, anti-homophobic media can benefit social workers, therapists, \nteachers, guides, educational counselors, tutors and parents in their attempt to \nempower LGBTQ clients and to lessen homophobia among heterosexuals. (Padva \n2007, 117) \n \nToward that end, the young people proposed a plot idea to reverse the expectations of our \nworld in a piece of work.  In other words, if the dominant type is heterosexual, flip it to \nqueer.   \nYOUTH:  I think it'd be cool to reverse the dynamic and to portray either a high \nschool or whatever where straight people can experience what queer people do, \nand have the dynamic entirely reversed and be questioned for how fucking weird \nthey are for being straight.  More stuff like that where changing it and letting \npeople as a whole like, where queer people can laugh and be petty like ‘Ha-ha, \nnow you know’ and straight people or cis-gendered people, can say like ‘oh, this \nis how I understand it and this is good art’. (Focus Group Session Three 2016) \n \nThis came up several times in different groups.  At its core is a desire for the mainstream \nmonoculture to see how the “other” lives.   \nLearning about Queerness Online \nMedia narratives are clearly presenting options to young people and the young \npeople then use these to help construct, explore, and adjust their identities while \nrecognizing themselves and becoming more aware of their inner selves.  However, youth \nalso seek out information from non-fictional history pieces, autobiographies, and the \nInternet.  Many youth use the Internet more than other information sources and access to \n  \n \n97 \na wider variety of online non-fiction information sources has made learning about the \nLGBTQ+ community and identity structures easy for young people (Bond, Hefner, and \nDrogos 2009; DeHaan et al. 2013).  A 2015 Pew Research Center report indicated that \n“92% of teens reported going online daily—including 24% who say they go online \nalmost constantly” (Lenhart et al. 2015, 2) with more than half (56%) going online \nseveral times a day.  Despite this data, internet is not accessible by all young people due \nto socioeconomic factors, affordability, geographic limitations, and other access \ndifficulties.  Gary Harper and his colleagues posit six thematic functions of the Internet in \ndeveloping sexual orientation identity. These include increasing self-awareness of one’s \nsexual orientation, learning about the queer community life, communicating with other \nqueer young people, meeting others, accepting one’s sexual orientation, and facilitating \nthe coming out process (Harper and Bruce 2016). The young people I interviewed are \ndefinitely aware of this transformation.  Ozzy, for example, detailed this change. \nOZZY: I feel like my generation is the last to kind of have the Internet as a new \ndeveloping thing. So, I'm 17 and eventually, I kind of came across the concept. \nAnd then basically, for the last six, maybe seven years, I've lived on just learning \nfrom the Internet about things like resources. (Ozzy 2017) \n \nOzzy recognizes the value of the Internet for finding out information and for connecting \nwith communities.  For this and future generations, young people may not feel \ncomfortable asking peers, parents, or other figures for information about sexuality and \ngender identity but will have access to the Internet.  Lili’s experience echoes several of \nthe study participants’ journey to learning more about their own identities. \nLILI: In sixth grade, it was around the time where people would just say “gay” as \na term for anything. “Oh, I like to watch this show.” “That’s gay.” “I play this \ngame.” “Oh, that’s gay.” So, I never understood what it meant, and then people \n  \n \n98 \nwould come back at them and say, “Well, ‘gay’ means ‘happy.’” So, I thought \n“gay” means “happy.” Obviously, that is probably the first term. So, I looked it up \nmyself because – I don’t know where it came down to me just wanting to think, \n“Let’s look up ‘gay.’ So, I looked up “gay,” and there was the term for happy, and \nthen there was another term for liking the same sex. It showed “homosexual,” \n“queer,” all these different things, and they all kind of meant the same thing. So, I \nlearned that way. (Lili 2017) \n \nIn this case, the use of the pejorative version of “gay” spurred Lili to explore more about \nthe word, which started a search for a new identity structure.  Penelope went on a similar \njourney but went the route through non-fiction documentaries about queer history, \nsparked from an auto-biographical graphic novel. \nPENELOPE: Like Alison Bechdel, she's a – yeah, she recently had a musical \nwritten about her called Fun Home. She is an illustrator, she wrote comics, and \nshe had a comic…But she talks about like queer culture and just being a queer \nwoman and I thought that was – I really like that other than my kind of type of \npersonality is one, when I realized I was a lesbian, I dove into research. So like, I \nwatched a bunch of documentaries about queer culture, not just being a lesbian \nbut a lot about like the Stonewall Riots and that whole movement. (Penelope \n2017) \n \nPenelope uses her strength as a curious researcher to learn more about the queer \nmovement and, through that, her own identity.  She attaches to narrative forms \nemphasizing biography and documentary techniques as a way to expand her \nunderstanding of the broader queer community.  It is significant that Penelope does not \ndescribe wanting to watch primetime television shows or to watch a fictional movie, \ninstead relying on what she sees as reliable information.   \nLearning About Queerness Through New Media \n The third information source I examine is new media.  New media is accessed \nthrough technical devices and includes going on social media, watching videos or reading \nblogs, playing games, emailing friends, etc.  Each has an interactive component and \n  \n \n99 \nallows for the viewer to also be a content creator.  Young people have this resource \navailable all day and easily access a variety of narratives.   \nReddit and Tumblr \nParticipants shared they found more about their identities through reading posts \non Reddit and Tumblr.  These interactive, blog-like website systems allow users to write \nabout their own experiences, tag key concepts (similar to Twitter), and follow sites they \nenjoy reading.  Ozzy, a teenage transgender participant, spoke in detail about using the \nInternet and Reddit/sub-Reddits to learn more about the trans community.  He had a hard \ntime finding information from traditional sources (peers, parents, and television), so he \nturned to the Internet for guidance. \nOZZY: I was never introduced to the concept. It was more like once – actually, I \nfeel like my generation is the last to kind of have the Internet as a new developing \nthing. So, I'm 17 and eventually, I kind of came across the concept. And then \nbasically, for the last six, maybe seven years, I've lived on just learning from the \nInternet about things like resources. Like learning from other trans people on the \nask transgender sub-Reddit. So, there's a lot of trans people that kind of hang out \nand talk about a variety of things. (Ozzy 2017) \n \nThese transgender sub-Reddits create a community for trans youth.  Ozzy also spoke \nabout sharing experiences, learning about other people’s struggles and successes, and \neven finding out about sub-Reddit user’s suicides through the digital space.  Reddit \nbecame a close-knit community where youth suicide was discussed and handled. \nDue to the limited media representation and less easily-accessible information \navailable on pan-sexuality, Ann-Jordan felt more comfortable sharing her thoughts \nonline.  She found the open discussions on Tumblr appealing.   \nANN-JORDAN: I know that being pan isn't an open – like when I say I'm pan, \npeople are like, “What does that mean?” And usually, I have to be like, “I'm just \n  \n \n100 \nbi” so that they don't have to make all the jokes about gender fluid folks and stuff \nlike that. But I don't know. I feel like I learn most of it from Tumblr and stuff. \nBecause they're an open group that you can have discussions about things. (Ann-\nJordan 2017) \n \nIt is also interesting that Ann-Jordan shares that her peers have a hard time understanding \npan-sexuality, especially as she describes her friend-group as queer.  This highlights that \nhaving a queer identity does not subsume a complex understanding of each identity \nstructure.  All youth, queer and non-queer, have to work through their own \nunderstandings of gender and sexuality.  In order to communicate her feelings for her \npeers, she builds it off of bisexuality instead of addressing the fine details between \nbisexuality and pansexuality.   \nAlice, a young non-binary, asexual teenager, also found Tumblr to be a \nwelcoming space for finding out more information.  She does suggest, however a critical \neye when taking in the information.  She states: \nALICE: Tumblr is a good place for that [learning about queerness]. You have to \nbe careful on Tumblr because there are a lot of people who just spew whatever \nwithout really facts, but I kind of like, I heard about things on Tumblr and then I \ndid my own research outside of that…There was a time when I was first kind of \nfiguring out my identity in the LGBT community, I was watching so many videos \non just about that. And like not even just the asexual part of it, but just like \neverything.  (Alice 2017) \n \nYouTube \nAlice also used YouTube to learn more about the LGBTQ+ community.  “On \nYouTube, I watch a bunch of different stuff. There was a time when I was first kind of \nfiguring out my identity in the LGBT community, I was watching so many videos on just \nabout that. And like not even just the asexual part of it, but just like everything (Alice \n2017).   \n  \n \n101 \nThis site allows users to upload their own videos on a variety of topics.  YouTube \nvideos and the corresponding YouTube celebrities came up often during my discussions \nwith the focus groups.  This becomes especially clear when examining the questionnaire \nresponses in the online category.   \nTable 5: Questionnaire Responses: Online Content \nTitle / Name Count \nTyler Oakley 10 \nBretman Rock 6 \nShane Dawson, Joey Graceffa 5 \nJeffree Star 4 \nManny Mua, Dodie Clark, Troye Sivan 3 \nConnor Franta, Hannah Hark, Stef Sanjati, Patrick Starrr, Gigi Gorgeous, \nGaby Dunn \n2 \nKasper Tait, Matthew Lush, Domo and Crissy, Larray XO, Lohanthony, \nBrutalmoose, The Gabbi Show, Evan Edinger, Doodleodle, Ricky Dillon, \nSteven Joseph, Itsbambi, Sean Paul, Angela Vanity, Pinkstylist, Amanda \nChronicles, Pubertina, Rose and Rosie, Ashley Mardell \n1 \nLater, in one of the case study interviews, I asked Alice to explain more about her \nexperience with YouTube.  The search capability of YouTube allows users to target \nparticular identity structures and interests (Fox and Ralston 2016). For her, she used the \nsite to get more information about identity options.  These videos provided options and \ninsight into something that she could not get from her family or friends.  \n  \n \n102 \nALICE: On YouTube, I watch a bunch of different stuff. There was a time when I \nwas first kind of figuring out my identity in the LGBT community, I was \nwatching so many videos on just about that. And like not even just the asexual \npart of it, but just like everything. I used to run a blog on Tumblr that was like \nsupport for LGBT youth and it got pretty high numbers with it, so I really wanted \nto like educate myself on all aspects of it so that I could help other people who \nwere struggling to find their identity as well. So, I think that’s pretty cool. (Alice \n2017) \n \nMichael, a poly-amorous, asexual focus group member found the Internet and YouTube \nas a way to learn about the differences between various sexual and gender-identity \noptions. \nMICHAEL: For a while I thought, I did think I was asexual but I was like that's \nnot entirely true, like maybe I'm half and half or a weird mixture.  But finally, I \nsat down and looked up every sexuality and I think.  But I didn't have any \nexample to see that.  But then I came across a random YouTube video and yeah, \njust like a lot of things. It's LGBT and not everything in between. (Focus Group \nSession Five 2007) \n \nWhile traditional media often presents few narrative and identity options to viewers, the \nInternet and new media provide a fuller spectrum of the queer rainbow.  Michael’s \nexperience shows how the Internet allows more information to be accessible and \ntherefore give more identity frames to young people (De Haan et al. 2013). \nNew Media Effects on Youth \nNew Media serves as an interactive and user-guided space to ask questions, and \nhear from others in the LGBTQ+ community with greater anonymity to explore a variety \nof perspectives and issues.  Perhaps the greatest effect new media has on young people is \nit provides an active space for youth-mediated and youth-created content.  Young people, \nthrough new media, can express themselves freely, hear from other young people over \ngreat physical distance, and can search for content specifically related to their questions \n  \n \n103 \nor experiences.  This leads to young people taking the initiative to explore a variety of \nidentity structures (DeHaan et al. 2013).  Additionally, “Media use may buffer some of \nthe effects of marginalization, such as isolation or victimization” (Craig et al. 2015, 269).  \nEven though the content-creator may be far away, the face to digital-face interaction, \nalbeit in recorded video, functions as friends sitting down to share experiences and get \ndifficult questions answered (Harper and Bruce 2016; Fox and Ralston 2016).  In an \nenvironment that may not be as conducive to free expression of ideas and diversity of \nsexual and gender identities, these digital platforms share the world and provide identity-\ndevelopment opportunities through a screen.   \nYOUTH: I feel like YouTube is also a good place for that [exploring your \nidentity] because you can get educated about stuff and you can find people who \nare experiencing the same things and have someone to relate to. Even though it's \nnot in person or someone that you know, it's someone that is similar to you in \nsome way. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nThese help the viewer make sense of themselves and their surroundings, even if the \nmixed messages from the physical community and the digital community may be \ndifferent. \nYOUTH: I also think there's going to be a little bit more of a difficulty \nunderstanding what's going on, I guess. I'm assuming that being in a smaller town, \nespecially Arizona, there is going to be more hatred and misunderstandings about \nbeing queer. Having this in your real life surrounding you at school and then \nbeing online and hearing positive things and the opposite. I think it would be \nmore confusing. I do think it would be very helpful that we have this access to \nmedia places, because otherwise I'd be really lost. (Focus Group Session Seven \n2017) \n \nShared experiences over social media sites and online environments also build resilience \nin young people (Ceglarek and Ward 2016).  “Media, especially online media, may be a \ncatalyst for resilience among LGBTQ youth.  Media help youth cope with discrimination \n  \n \n104 \nand navigate the turbulence of adolescence and young adulthood as LGBTQ individuals” \n(Craig et al. 2015, 269).  YouTube and other digital peer-to-peer systems allow youth \nusers to share their experiences and offer encouragement.  When in a cultural \nenvironment where this frame-sharing is limited due to political, social, or religious \nlimitations, then the online environment is even more of a significant factor. \nChapter Conclusions \nA narrative analysis approached to the data analysis revealed a strong focus on \nthemes of accuracy and information-seeking.  After examining the traditional media and \nnormativity and exploring youth responses, these youth are hyper-aware of the narrative \ntropes.  These included lesbian death, gay best friends, bullying, and queer AIDS victims.  \nI highlighted the effects tropes have on young people and offered solutions from the \nyouth themselves.  The participants long for queer artists to be partners in telling queer \nstories, for acceptance, for queerness to be decentralized from the narrative, and \npresenting consequences to queer violence onscreen. Additionally, their search for truth \nis taking them away from traditional media forms and into digital spaces, online \ninformation sources, and toward new interactive, content-creation-rich new media spaces.  \nThe next chapter explores the ways narrative are impacted through communities and how \ncommunities are impacted by narratives. \n  \n  \n \n105 \nCHAPTER FOUR: SOCIAL INFLUENCES AND NARRATIVE \nHeading into the data analysis process, I had a few expectations about what I may \nfind.  During the focus groups and case studies, I could already see themes emerging.  \nWhen I began to examine the data an unexpected theme emerged; the impact of the \ncommunity on youth interaction with narrative and narrative interactions on youth \ncommunity.  I did not expect so many youth in the focus groups and case studies to attend \nto their families, friends, schools, and online communities.  Chapter 4 presents the \nunexpected findings on the intersections between a youth’s social influences and youth \nqueer narratives.  Guiding my analysis in this chapter, I use the following related research \nquestions: \n• Where do young people learn about queerness? \n• How do social relationships and social networks affect narrative interpretation and \ninteraction? \nI examine how social relationships influence narrative interpretations and interactions, as \nwell as how narratives affect social relationships.  A youth’s family, peer group, school, \nand online community may lead to a youth’s ability to freely explore narrative and \nexperiment with identity structures (DeHaan et al. 2013).  I also explore the impact \nnarrative has on communities by creating common ground for group cohesion. \nThe Family’s Influence on Narratives \nAs the family unit is often the primary social group for young people growing up, \nit plays a large role in identity development.  The values, attitudes, and beliefs of family \nmembers resonate with a child well into adult life.  My discussions with the focus group \n  \n \n106 \nand case study participants highlight the influence family has on youth engagement with \nqueer narratives.  Three case study participants highlight the impact family has, shaping \nthe way the young people engage with queer youth narratives and queerness itself.   \nFirst, Zol explains that her home life was full of different types of people that \nimpacted her view of the LGBTQ+ community.  “When I was younger, there were \nalways gay people around my house because my mom was really good friends with them, \nand she had this really good personal connection, and I got to talk to them, and I was like, \n‘Wow, the gay life seems cool’” (Zol 2017).  This childhood experience provided diverse \nrole models and by seeing her own parents interact positively, it set up positive \nexpectations for her own identity exploration experience.  For her, this identity \nexploration began in elementary school. \nZOL: The thing is that I would go around school at such a young age and be like, \n“Am I interested in boys or am I interested in girls?” I would somewhat feel so \nattracted towards girls and I would feel so much more attracted to guys at the \nsame time.  So, it made me question it, and one day, I sat my mom down and \nasked her about these feelings, and she’s like, “Are you a lesbian, or are you \nstraight?” I’m like, “Mom, I feel like I’m a little bit of both.” She told me a little \nstory about it, and she’s like, “Maybe you just need to experiment to know what \nyou actually like.” (Zol 2017) \n \nZol’s mother encourages her to examine her own feelings and opens the door to \nexperimentation, perhaps through watching television shows about queerness and looking \naround online.  This experience shows that the family’s social environment (her mother’s \nqueer friends) and a family’s attitude towards queerness (as seen in her mother’s reaction \nto Zol’s questions) can support a young person’s exploratory journey into new narratives \nand experimentation.   \n  \n \n107 \n Another case study member, Ozzy, had a family member influence his queer \nidentity journey.  His older brother induldged his younger sibling’s questions about \ngender. He began to explore more about his identity after a trip to New York City and an \nencounter with a loud public speaker.   \nOZZY: I knew that I was trans since very, very, very early on in my life but the \nfirst time I learned that it was an actual thing or anything similar to that was – I \nmust have been like nine, I think. And for whatever reason, my family was in \nNew York. I think visiting family. Something like that. I don’t remember. And so, \nwe were in the park by the Dakota and at the John Lennon memorial. So, there \nwas a guy. I guess he did that a lot because he had a microphone and he was set-\nup. And he was just telling weird stories. And he said something about smoking \nwith a transvestite or whatever is the word he said.  \n \nAnd then me being the horribly naïve child I was, I asked my brother what that \nmeant. And he was very uncomfortable with that. But I guess the first thing I was \ntold was a transvestite is a guy who wears dresses is the first thing I heard. And \nmy brother was like 12 and trying to explain what this whole concept of breaking \ngender norms. And he was kind of saddled with a huge task and he didn’t really \nmeet the challenge. But I can’t blame him. He was like 12 and trying to tell a 9-\nyear-old, just very awkwardly in public. But I guess that kind of influenced how I \nthought it was viewed. Because it came across as very taboo. And of course, it is \nto kind of – it’s very dangerous and there’s a lack of acceptance.  (Ozzy 2017) \n \nOzzy’s twelve-year-old brother helped him on his identity journey through an honest \nanswer to a potentially tricky question, even though he indicated his brother did not know \nwhat he was talking about.  This experience shows that interactions with trusted family \nmembers close to the same age can impact a young person’s journey.  His brother gave \nhim the terminology to begin exploring narratives, also highlighting that family can help \nfocus a young person’s narrative search. \n Finally, Lili highlights how a family’s previous experience with queerness can \nshape a young person’s queer journey and youth narrative engage.  Lili also had a \n  \n \n108 \nsupportive home environment around queerness, amplified due to a tragic death in the \nfamily.  \nLILI: So, where I learned about it – it does come from television, but it also – in \nmy family, we’re a very open family. I think that actually happened…2000, \naround that time, I had an uncle who was gay, and I didn’t know that he was gay. \nI was 4 or something in 2000. He ended up committing suicide because he was \ndeaf, and people would make fun of him at school and things like that, so he \nended up killing himself. Ever since then, they were able – his family – his mom \nand them didn’t know that he was gay. They never questioned it, or anything like \nthat.  So, when it happened, literally, all the siblings – to the parents – were like, \n“He was gay, and he was deaf, and he was bullied because of it.” So then, I think \nthat made them realize, “Okay, that’s not good. I think we need to make it so that \nwhoever is gay should be more comfortable around us.” In their lifetime, they’d \njust – they weren’t very open about that kind of thing. They’re very old, \ntraditional Mexicans. They came from Nogales, Mexico.  So, as time went by, I \nhave another uncle who ended up saying he was gay, and then, I have an aunt who \nis a lesbian, and I have another aunt who is bisexual. My mom has experimented, \nand she’s told me about it. So, my family’s very open with that kind of thing. At \nfirst, I didn’t really understand all of it. Sixth grade was when it really hit me.  \n(Lili 2017) \n \nAccording to Lili, this sudden death in the family began a conversation about being queer \nand the need for family to support each other.  She expresses that both television \nprogramming and this family experience educated her about queerness.  Additionally, it \nopened up the possibilities for other family members to explore their own feelings.  \nSimilar to Zol, Lili was able to reach out to her mother with questions and, based on her \nmother’s family experience, she was able to answer her child’s questions.  Her mother \nalso contributed to Lili’s experimentation with gender performance. \nLILI: It was around that time where my mom gave me this small, cheap palette of \nmakeup, and of course, my first makeup that I ever did was a whole bunch of \nfoundation, blue eye shadow, and red lipstick. She was like, “You look like a \ngrandma.” I was like, “No, I don’t.” My uncle went as Bettie Page for Halloween. \nSo, he had this Bettie Page wig, and he had some makeup, and he gave that all to \nme. And so, I wore it and things like that.  (Lili 2017) \n \n  \n \n109 \nFrom that point on, Lili was able to experiment more with her gender identity.  She began \nto wear dresses and make-up outside of the home, to local arts events, and finally to \nschool.  Her family relationships, particularly through her mother’s early support helped \nLili engage with queer narratives and experiment with her own gender identity \nrepresentation.  Based on these three stories, a family’s values, attitudes, and beliefs \nabout queerness, as well as their own collective experiences, informs youth engagement \nwith queer narratives and identity development. \nThe School Community’s Influence on Narratives \n Outside of the home life, the school community is where young people spend the \nmajority of their time.  According to the Pew Research Center, “83% of teens spend time \nwith their closest friends at school” (Lenhart et al. 2015, 9).  This community shapes \nyouth identity construction and is an environment for encountering queer narratives.  \nPenelope engages with the pejorative version of “gay” at school.  She used that \nexperience to become a stronger woman, stating, “it helped me to be very outgoing and \nspeak my mind” (Penelope 2017).  She decided to not accept the negative comments and \nnegative narrative associations coming from her peers in school.  These school \nexperiences help shape her interpretation of queerness. \n The school environment can also be a supportive, safe space for young people.  \nBoth Penelope and Alice attend the same arts charter school.  Each noticed the feeling of \ncommunity and security in their educational environment.  Penelope shared “we're very – \nthere's a very large queer population, which is amazing because it feels like such a safe \nspace” (Penelope 2017).  The school’s queer youth density impacted their comfort level.  \n  \n \n110 \nAlice highlighted the campus community and student make-up add to a feeling of safety \nand security while also broadening her awareness of queerness.   \nALICE: Yeah, so I really had no idea about the LGBT community at all until I \nstarted coming to this school…I think before that I didn’t think I was queer \nbecause I didn’t know that it even existed, so I didn’t think I was anything else \nthan like “normal” because I didn’t know that anything else existed. But when I \ncame here and started learning more about it, I was like, “Hey, I actually think \nthat might be a thing that I'm like.” So yeah, coming to the school definitely helps \nwith that.  And this school being like a liberal arts school there are a lot of \nLGBTQ people here. So, once I started coming here, I started learning about it \nand I kind of started figuring it on my own. Because my family is very \nconservative, so I knew they wouldn’t tell me about it, so I kind of had to figure it \nout on my own… So, yeah, a lot of my friends are queer. There are a lot of us \nhere at this school. Yeah, I would say I probably have more queer friends than I \nhave straight friends. (Alice 2017) \n \nThe school environment and her peer group provided an information source for her \nidentity journey and helped explore queerness.  While her family was more conservative, \nshe could more freely learn about sexuality from her peers at school.  Additionally, Alice \ntook advantage of the school environment to gather with other adolescents, get involved, \nand help others by leading a Gay/Straight Alliance.   \nALICE: But once I got into high school, I joined the Gay-Straight Alliance at my \nschool and I'm kind of one of the like head members of it now and we just try to \nlike do a lot of education and we talk about problems that we’re facing or \nproblems just like that are going on in the world generally, like recently with trans \nbathroom rights, that whole situation happening. (Alice 2017) \n \nThe school community not only became a safe space for her to explore her own identity, \nit provided an opportunity to explore social and political issues.  According to Alice the \nschool environment fostered her confidence, her willingness and freedom to take risks, \nand to engage others about issues that matter to her.  Both Alice and Penelope expressed \nthat the school culture and climate around queer issues allowed them to more openly \n  \n \n111 \nexplore queerness.  Alice’s experience highlights that the school community introduced \nqueerness directly through her peer groups, fostered in a safe, supportive environment.  \nQueer narratives were allowed to thrive in the school community and impacted Alice and \nPenelope’s experiences. \nOnline Community’s Influence on Narratives \nYoung people today have access to a growing community online.  A queer \ncommunity that began as chat rooms, instant messengers, and dating websites, is \ncontinually evolving into blogs, social networks, peer-content creation sites, and a whole \nnew generation of interactivity.  The expanding online community has also introduced \nnew queer narratives to young people.  The Internet has become a valuable and effective \nmeans for young people to develop their identities (Harper and Bruce 2016).  \nOnline communities impact youth through facilitating opportunities to develop \nfriendships.  The Pew Research Center’s 2015 study indicates that “57% of teens ages 13 \nto 17 have made a new friend online, with 29% of teens indicating they have made more \nthan five new friends in online venues” (Lenhart et al. 2015, 2).  Of that 57%, 64% met a \nfriend on social media with the other 36% through online games (2015).  Regarding \nsocial media sites, Facebook is used the most, with “71% of all teens using the site, even \nas half of teens use Instagram and four-in-ten use Snapchat” (2015, 2).  Additionally, \n71% indicate they use more than one social media site.  Finally, social media sites can be \na place where young people feel supported.  The Pew Research Center found that 68% of \nteens surveyed experienced “people supporting you through challenges/tough times” \n  \n \n112 \n(2015, 6).  Previous research indicates that young people are using social media and \nonline resources to build a community.  The youth researchers back-up this information.  \nThe youth are also using this online environment and social community to explore \nqueerness.  Recent research has examined the role of social media sites in identity \ndevelopment (Harper and Bruce 2016), mental health and support (Ceglarek and Ward \n2016), and learning about sexuality and gender (Fox and Ralston 2016).  These studies \nemphasize the ability for social media to connect young people, to learn about the queer \ncommunity, and to learn about the variety of options ahead of them.  Ozzy, Alice, and \nseveral of the focus group participants discussed the interactions between online \ncommunities and youth queer narratives. \nOzzy’s online community of choice is Reddit.  This website allows users to create \ntheir own pages, post blogs, create discussion groups, comment on threads and, as a \nresult, create an intricate community.  As Ozzy explored his transgender identity, he \nfound the website to be particularly valuable.   \nOZZY: Like learning from other trans people on the “Ask Transgender” \nsubreddit. So, there's a lot of trans people that kind of hang out and talk about a \nvariety of things…So, people asking kind of showing their narratives. Like asking \nfor advice because they got kicked out or because they got yelled at. Or this is \nwhat I want to do and I'm nervous about being harassed or killed. On one hand, \nthere is a really healthy supportive community.  (Ozzy 2017) \n \nBlog websites like Reddit and Tumblr provide you the opportunity to self-publish, share \ntheir thoughts and feelings with others, some of which are going through similar \nexperiences.  The sites give young people a place to ask questions, share experiences, \nlearn about gender identities and sexual orientations, and find other youth going through \n  \n \n113 \nsimilar experiences.  While youth may be separated by geographic distance, they can find \nsupport close by through the Internet (DeHaan et al. 2013).   \nResearch also demonstrates that social media can foster negative feelings about \noneself and contribute to mental health problems.  Pew also found that 68% experienced \n“people stirring up drama” and 42% experienced “people posting things about you that \nyou can’t change or control” (Lenhart et al. 2015).  Ozzy indicates Reddit is a source of \ninformation and community building, but also can become “dark” and “heavy” through \ndiscussions of suicide.  In particular, he describes how he sees trans-youth suicide in a \nnew way based on story making national news. \nOZZY: But on the other hand, I was learning about very dark, heavy things that \nwere really intimidating from a very young age…Having people that I've gotten \nto know and relate to just disappearing. And suicide has been a thing that has been \non the peripheral of my life for a long time. People that I've known and through \nthat community I've been exposed to it more…I guess the most famous example \nis I'd come across a user who their Reddit handle was Nostalgia Princess. And \nthat turned out to be Leelah Alcorn who committed suicide in December 2014, I \nbelieve. So that was kind of the turning point for me…And it went on about her \nfeelings about the world and her feelings about her parents. And how it was \nextremely difficult with a lot of concepts that I really related to. And that was the \nfirst time that it really hit me pretty hard. Because I'd known her for a little while \nand we'd talked. (Ozzy 2017) \n \nFor Ozzy and other LGBTQ+ youth, the ability to share their own experiences are a key \nelement for their online community.  As indicated, Ozzy learned more about suicide, \ntrans-violence, and other important issues from Reddit.  Additionally, throughout the \nfocus group process and into his case study interview, he was acutely aware of narratives \naround trans-identities and those that involved violence. \nAlice used Tumblr to create online content as an extension of her work with her \nschool’s Gay/Straight Alliance.  She demonstrates youth’s ability to use an online \n  \n \n114 \ncommunity to spread narratives to other online community members and share her own \nstory.  Alice states, “I had like an open inbox for people to ask questions and stuff and I \nwould answer with advice and personal stories and research that I had. I just tried to help \nin any way that I could, and if I didn’t know, I would refer them to somebody else” \n(2017).  She wants to guide other young people who are still figuring out their own \nidentities, as others help her.  Research into youth use of social media sites and YouTube-\nlike content creation sites, which echoes Alice’s experience, highlight that youth do so to \neducate others and allow for greater self-expression (Fox and Ralston 2016).  Even \nthough she may never meet these individuals face-to-face, the online mediated \nenvironment allows her to become part of a peer-community to share her experiences and \nnarratives. \nParticipants in the sixth focus group discussed YouTube in greater detail and how \nit can shape individual feelings and expectations about being queer, as well as create and \npresent new narratives to young people.  I asked the participants to explain the YouTube \nphenomenon in more detail.  This selection highlights the variety of narratives that come \nthrough this online community. \nYOUTH 1.  For me, I really like the YouTubers who have a lot of artsy stuff. Like \nDodie has a lot of music. She also just is really open about her feelings and \nexperiences. A lot of them really match up with things I'm going through. It's \ninteresting to see how other people handle it. Their community is very inviting \nand accepting and relatable, I guess.  \nYOUTH 2.  Hannah Hart does something called My Drunk Kitchen, where she \nmakes food when she's drunk. It's just funny.  \nINTERVIEWER.  And is she queer?  \nYOUTH 2.  Mm-hmm. Yeah.  \nINTERVIEWER.  Does she talk about it on the show?  \nYOUTH 3.  Not much. It's just kind of known that she's queer.  \nYOUTH 4.  She talks about it in other things.  \n  \n \n115 \nYOUTH 3.  Every once in a while, she'll make videos about it, but it's not her \nmain thing.  \nYOUTH 1.  Mostly it's side comments and jokes, but really –  \nYOUTH 3.  Honestly, I kind of like that because I feel like a lot of queer media is \nabout them being queer. It's not that they're a person who happens to be queer. \nIt's that their whole thing is that they're queer. I don't like that. I'm queer. I'm a \nnormal person, though. It's great for people who are queer who makes videos \nabout being queer. I think that's great, too. It definitely helps people who are \ntrying to figure things out and are going through stuff. It's great to get \neducated about it. But I also feel like a lot of books or TV shows that have \nqueer characters are centered entirely around that person coming to terms with \nbeing queer.  \nYOUTH 1.  Yeah, some YouTubers are very much just like, \"Let's sit down and \ntalk about me and you.\" But a lot of people on YouTube do comedy or things \nto be funny or educational videos. It's not all just one thing. There are a lot of \ndifferent types. Tyler Oakley is certainly more comedy centered and \nentertainment –  \nALL.  Yeah.  \nYOUTH 1.  – than, \"Let me just sit down and tell you about my day.\"  \nYOUTH 2.  Same with Shane Dawson.  \nYOUTH 3.  I feel like YouTube is also a good place for that because you can get \neducated about stuff and you can find people who are experiencing the same \nthings and have someone to relate to. Even though it's not in person or \nsomeone that you know, it's someone that is similar to you in some way. \n(Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nThese young people describe the variety of narratives that the YouTube community \npresents.  Some of those narratives decentralize queerness to be a less significant factor \nwhile others focus on education and teaching the viewer.  Other pieces present a day-in-\nthe-life snapshot.  Rather than reinforce existing narratives, like those in traditional \nmedia, the youth express new media adapts these narrative aesthetic choices.  The \nYouTube celebrities, their constructed identities, and video content the youth describe \nhighlight this aesthetic shift.  Each of these narratives are transmitted through YouTube \nand then shared among the youth communities; strengthening and connecting the \ncommunities \n  \n \n116 \nNarratives’ Influence on Communities \nWhile family, school, and online communities spread narratives, narratives also \nshape youth values, attitudes, and beliefs of the LGBTQ+ community as well as impact \nthe communities themselves.  Youth queer narratives create community among young \nviewers. This becomes evident through conversations with the focus group and case \nstudy participants.  Narratives helped Tila, for example, create a closer bond with her \nfamily.  She shared her own experiences watching queer television with her mother. \nTILA.  Me and my mom watch TV together. \nINTERVIEWER.  Do you find that you’re – because you watch TV with your \nmom, do you feel like there’s some shows that you probably shouldn’t watch \naround her, or some that you don’t feel like – \nTILA.  My mom does not care about nothing. She’s worse than me. \nINTERVIEWER.  Any awkward moments sitting on the couch next to your mom \nwhen something happens? \nTILA.  Yeah. She makes it awkward. I don’t. She’s not the “cover your eyes” \nkind of mom. She’s like, “Open your eyes, because you’re going to see it \nwhen you get older, so you might as well look at it now.” \nINTERVIEWER.  Okay. What were some of those things that you were like, “Oh, \nmy God, I’m watching this next to my mom”? \nTILA.  Like 13 Reasons. We watched the whole show together, and then, when \nCourtney and Hannah were in the room, I was like, “Something gay is going \nto happen.” My mom said, “Nothing gay’s going to happen.” But then, they \nkissed. I was like, “I told you, Mom.” \nINTERVIEWER.  What was her reaction? \nTILA.  She was like, “Oh.” She didn’t care. It was just funny. (Tila 2017) \n \nTila and her mom’s experience highlights the shared moment between the two by \nengaging in queer narratives.  This experience also showcases the positive role parents \ncan play by watching media with their children.  “Parents play an important role in \nmediating children’s television viewing to counter negative effects of violent and sexual \ntelevision” (Hust, Wong, and Chen 2011, 381).  The researchers go on to state that \n“although violent and sexual television content concern parents, certain television content \n  \n \n117 \ncan provide social and behavioral modeling” (Hust, Wong, and Chen 2011, 382).  In \nTila’s case, the shared narrative experience allowed her space to connect with her mother \nand showed Tila that her mother could be supportive and be able to discuss big issues. \nThe community building aspect of these narratives can be seen in how the young \npeople talk about the pieces and build each other’s ideas.  They have a common \nexperience and a common variety of sources and they use narratives to engage in \nfriendship-building conversations.  The young people watch many of the same shows, \nshare their favorite videos, and while they may not remember all the names, their \ncollective experience (and with it, their community building dynamic) can be tracked in \ntheir discussions.  For example, when speaking of a popular Netflix series, the youth said \n“Ohhh, Orange is the New Black” / “Oh Yes! Oh my god!” (Focus Group Session Four \n2017).  When the same group was brainstorming other titles, they even highlighted a \nhierarchy of queer representation.  “Oh, you know what else? Ellen! The show” / “Oh \nyeah!” / “Ahh” / “We forgot about the main gay person!” (Focus Group Session Four \n2017).  This group of friends build off each other’s ideas and highlight the shared youth \ncommunity through queer narrative viewership.   \nYouth also connect specific television shows with their friendships.  This became \napparent when the participants in the second focus group talked about anoter Netflix \nseries.   \nYOUTH 1.  Jessica Jones \nYOUTH 2.  Yes! Ugh yes! \nYOUTH 3.  What was it? \nYOUTH 4.  Jessica Jones? Never seen it \nYOUTH 3.  I seen it but I never watched it \nYOUTH 2.  How can you-- \n  \n \n118 \nYOUTH 3.  Am I like a bad person?  You told me to watch it, like over the \nsummer, but I never did.  But like, her shows are my shows! (Focus Group \nSession Two 2016) \n \nNarratives serve as a strong common experience that connects these two friends together.  \nViewing this series is emblematic of their friendship as “her shows are my shows!”  They \nhave created a small community of television viewership and use that to signify and \nsupport their friendship.   \nAnother example of community built through shared narrative encounters came \nfrom the seventh focus group session.  These youth showcased their shared narratives and \nexperiences when they were brainstorming YouTube contributors.   \nYOUTH 1. Dodie Clark.  \nYOUTH 2.  Yeah, I put her, too.  \nALICE. Oh, yeah. That's who I was thinking of.  \nYOUTH 2.  I have Dodie as well.  \nYOUTH 1. Ashley Mardell – actually, now goes by Ash Hardell.  \nINTERVIEWER.  Okay.  \nYOUTH 1. Yeah, they basically make a bunch of YouTube videos about being \nqueer and stuff.  \nYOUTH 3.  Troye Sivan.  \nYOUTH 1. Oh, Troye.  \nYOUTH 4.  Oh, yeah. Right. Tyler Oakley, obviously.  \nYOUTH 1. Conner Franta.  \nYOUTH 3.  Oh, yeah. How did I not think of that? Gaby Dunn or Douglas or –  \nYOUTH 2.  Dunn. It's got to be Dunn. It's Dunn.  \nYOUTH 3.  Gaby Dunn. I also have Rose and Rosie. They're married and have a \nreally cute channel.  \nYOUTH 4.  I have Hannah Hart.  \nYOUTH 1. Joey Graceffa. (Focus Group Session Seven 2017) \n \nThey are building off each other’s ideas, improving the collective knowledge, and adding \nto the community collection of queer narratives.  They are also providing new content for \ntheir peers to watch.  In another focus group, this happened with make-up tutorials. \n“Make-Up tutorials, like guys that do their make-up.” “Oh yeah, Bretman Snapchat” \n  \n \n119 \n“Who’s that one dude? Manny Mora, he looks like Mr. [name removed]” (Focus Group \nSession Four 2017).  These YouTube and online narratives are shared among young \npeople and become a common experience from which they build friendships. \nChapter Conclusions \nA narrative analysis approach to the focus group and case study data revealed an \nunexpected angle in the interaction between narratives and young people: social \nrelationships.  After examining the youth responses, it becomes clear that a young \nperson’s family relationships, school, and online community influence how narratives are \nabsorbed or rejected by young people and whether they feel comfortable exploring \nqueerness.  The analysis also revealed narratives are a community-building element for \nyoung people with YouTube videos and television shows becoming a shared experience.  \nNarratives are, in part, regulated and spread by social networks and at the same time \nprovide connective tissue to the social networks themselves.  The analysis also points \naddresses new media practices of supporting different aesthetic and artistic choices \nthrough user-created content. \n  \n  \n \n120 \nCHAPTER FIVE:  DISCOVERIES AND IMPLICATIONS \nNow that I have examined, explored, and unpacked the research, I discuss the \nimplications this research has on the broader discourse communities.  I believe that \neducators, theatre makers, scholars, and even the queer community each have something \nto take away from this research.  In this final chapter, I offer my conclusions which \ninclude: trusting youth as co-researchers, young people expressing stereotype and trope \nfatigue, honoring youth as content creators, recognizing the growing complexity of \nsexual orientations and gender identities. \nBefore moving forward, I am not trying to speak for all young people through the \ncreation of an archetypal youth.  I base these conclusions on my conversations with these \nspecific young people in my focus groups and case studies.  I encourage readers and \nfuture scholars, artists, and educators to speak directly to the youth in their own \ncommunities about what they hope to see from the world, whether onscreen, onstage, or \nonline. \nReturning to the Question \nI begin by returning to my core research question; “How do young people engage, \ninterpret, and respond to queer narratives?”  Through the narrative analysis of my \ncollected case studies, focus groups, and my own scholarly research, I find young people \nactively engage, interpret, and respond to youth queer narratives.  My findings all point \naway from a passive youth viewer and toward an intelligent and critical youth narrative \nconsumer.   \n  \n \n121 \nThe youth I spoke with demonstrated that they engaged with narrative pieces with \ncuriosity.  Several participants noted that queer content would likely bring them to a \ntelevision show or other narrative medium, but the story and characters would keep them \nthere.  My focus group and case study members interpreted narratives by reading \nthemselves out of a story, rather than into one, demonstrating an after-queer approach \npresented in Chapter 1.  With the increased quantity of youth queer narratives, these \nyouth did not try to interpret a story by adding queerness to it, but rather stepped back \nfrom existing queer narratives, reflected on their personal experiences, identity structures, \nand feelings, and examined the use of stereotypes, tropes, characters, and plot devices \nused.  The youth were honest, even others in the room felt differently about a given topic.  \nYouth also respond to narratives by creating their own.  Several participants shared their \nown content-creation experience while others discussed other youth responses seen in \nnew media websites like YouTube, Tumblr, and Reddit.  My research process also \nrevealed several other key findings including the value of youth as co-researchers, \nnarrative-hawks, and identity mold-breakers.  I examine each of these findings and \nconnect a related research implication. \nYouth as Co-Researchers \n First and foremost, my research has demonstrated the value in treating youth as \nco-researchers and insightful information resources.  The young people in my study were \nthoughtful, critical, and graciously shared their ideas with me.  Many of the conclusions \nin this chapter were only possible because the young people challenged my thinking \nabout youth, queerness, and the narratives we all encounter.  Additionally, with each \n  \n \n122 \ngroup the questions remained the same but the conversation focused on different areas.  \nBy talking with six different groups, I received a deeper understanding of youth queer \nnarratives.  In other words, I found that engaging more than one group of young people \nyields more complex results.  Trusting youth as co-researchers meant recognizing that \ndifferent groups of youth have different opinions, ideas, and feelings about the world \naround them.  This finding directly relates to seeing youth co-research as supporting an \nepistemological shift in research. \nImplication #1: Shifting Epistemologies \nHow do researchers learn about youth?  What youth knowledge do researchers \ntrust?  What youth knowledge is valid and valued?  Each of these questions highlight \nepistemological considerations about trusting youth as co-researchers.  My research \nrepresents and supports an epistemological shift through valuing youth voices as \nknowledge-makers.  It represents a shift from youth as students to trusted scholars, and \nfrom adults as all-knowing researcher/teacher/scholars to listeners and learners.  \nEpistemologically, this shifts knowledge making from a retrospective adult gaze \nbackwards to a contemporaneous analysis by young people about their views in the \nmoment.  How do researchers gain trusted, valid and valued knowledge about youth?  By \nasking youth themselves. \nYouth as Narrative-Hawks \n As smart and analytic humans, the young people I spoke with have keen eyes for \ntracking and examining narratives.  As Congressional deficit-hawks keep a close, critical \neye on budgets, so do youth engage critically and closely with narratives.  My young \n  \n \n123 \nresearch colleagues spotted the presence of stereotypes and tropes in the media, the over-\nreliance on one character type going through heteronormative plot structures, holes in \nrepresentational diversity, trends and limitations in youth queer narratives.  Contrary to a \nprevailing opinion (and previous research), young people are not passive consumers of \nnarrative content, mindlessly plugged into traditional media or wandering aimlessly in \nnew media click-bait.  Young people, as demonstrated in my focus groups and case \nstudies, are critical thinkers intentionally choosing the content they consume, \ninvestigating the representations, and challenging the messages put forward.   \nNot only do they see these constructions, but they have ideas about how to change \nthe narratives themselves.  They want characters onscreen and onstage that are as \ncomplex and opinionated as they are.  They have become predictable and do not match \nthe experiences of youth audiences.   As described in the previous chapters, they also \nhave insightful ideas about the motivations behind stereotypes, trope use, and \nconstruction.  These include content creators playing it safe with mainstream audiences, \nusing the white, gay, male character as an entry point into queer subject matter, and \ntreating queerness as a problem to be addressed instead of a character trait to be explored \nand/or ignored.  Similar to the youth’s perceptions of their own lives, they want the \ncharacters’ sexualities to be secondary to their stories and not the only relevant detail for \nan audience.  With that said, they also want to see an increase in queer narratives and \ncharacters beyond a white, gay, male representation.  They want intersectional characters \nof various religions, racial and ethnic backgrounds, and of diverse sexual orientations and \n  \n \n124 \ngender identities.  They are narrative-hawks; active, discerning, and opinionated about \nthe world around them.  I connect these findings to implications in research methodology. \nImplication #2: Shifting Methodologies \nMy study demonstrates that directly engaging with young people through \nqualitative research yields valuable and significant results that may not have been \npossible through an adult-only survey of youth programming or online content.  While \nsome researchers have interviewed youth after high school and asked adults to reflect on \ntheir childhood, speaking with youth while still young provides timely, direct knowledge.  \nTalking with young people about youth issues, opinions, and content is served through a \nmethodology that directly engages with them.   \nResearchers must also methodologically engage queerly by rejecting binary \ndemographic data.  Instead of listing gender or “sex” as an option of either male or \nfemale, gender identity demographic collection should include more options and a space \nfor the young person to list whatever term desired.  Also, instead of attempting to read \ngender from physical appearance, researchers hosting focus groups and case study \ninterviews need to ask each participant about preferred gender pronouns and respectfully \nuse the pronouns during the interviews, in writing, and when sharing the results.  This \nshift in methodology also extends to participants expressing intersectional demographic \ncategories like race, ethnicity, and religious beliefs.   \nBuilding off the first finding, youth as co-researchers, another methodological \nshift extends into school, through turning learning ownership over to young people.  \nInstead of trying to provide content that may connect with young people, teachers can \n  \n \n125 \nhave youth select works that are relevant to them with examples that fit the desired \ntheme, genre, issue, etc.  Instead of teachers saying “Go home and watch this television \nshow,” they could ask youth to find examples of a narrative device, social trend, or \ncharacter component.  This also involves building queer content into the curriculum.  \nRather than having a one-off lesson, which can lead to student feelings of isolation and \nalienation by LGBTQ+ adolescents (Snapp et al. 2015), teachers can include queer \nsubjects and content into the curriculum. \nYouth as Identity Mold-Breakers \n Youth are also engaging with identity in new, complex ways.  Ten to 15 years \nago, the identity options for young people were primarily focused on the LGBT acronym.  \nA person was lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.  While talking to young people, I \nwas amazed at their use of gender-identity and sexual orientation prefixes including \n“pan,” “a-,” and “demi.”  They recognized and valued each person’s individual feelings \nwithin the group and never balked at another’s expressed sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  The focus group and case study participants’ descriptions shifted identity \nstructures away from a few rigid, binary categories into nuanced, flexible identity \npossibilities.  For example, in one of the focus group sessions, the young people were \nnegotiating the differences between pansexuality, bisexuality, and asexuality with ease.  \nThe young people also reflected on intersectionality through discussing the ways gender \nidentity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and religion interacted, were represented (or \nnot represented), produced, and also perceived by the viewing public.  Youth expressed \nidentity structures as a spectrum, with many different shades of gray between traditional \n  \n \n126 \nblack and white binaries.  This finding has implications for artistic communities engaged \nin representing queerness.   \nImplication #3: Shifting Artistic Representations and Aesthetics \n Artists and narrative producers must shift their representation strategies in order \nto keep engaging youth viewers.  My research shows that young people are tired of \nstereotypes, tropes, and other traditional narrative constructions.  As previously indicated, \nyoung people see gender identity and sexual orientation as a more complex spectrum than \nthe limited options narratives present.  Rather than present a limited range of characters \nand plots, failing to trust young people, artists need to create intersectional and diverse \nrepresentations onscreen, onstage, and online.  These youth, when asked about what they \nwould like to see from youth queer narratives, desire traditional media to break the binary \nmold which constrains queer characters by including more gender identities, sexual \norientations, skin tones, backgrounds, and faiths.  The youth want shows that both \nhighlight the queer experience and pieces that treat queerness as just another character \ntrait undeserving of an after-school-special.  These do not contradict each other but rather \nrepresent the range of youth needs and the complexity of their narrative interactions.  In \nparticular, representations that portray anti-queer violence and pieces that quickly kill off \nqueer characters are at the top of these youths’ list of artistic choices to go.  Overall, \nyouth queer narratives need to be diversified onscreen, online, and onstage.  \nImplication #4: Theatre for Young Audiences \nAs a theatre scholar, I turn my attention to my field.  Based on this research and \non my previous research into Theatre for Young Audiences (TYA) plays, the theatre \n  \n \n127 \nartistic community has changes to make as well.  TYA is not presenting diverse queer \nprotagonists or supporting characters.  I add my voice to other scholars like Annie \nGianinni and Manon van de Water, who have made clear before that queer TYA is full of \nbullied and abused gay, cis-gendered males.  The TYA community needs to do better.  It \ncan be a role-model for other art forms through a brave commitment to present \nintersectional, diverse, queer characters on amazing adventures, dramatic journeys, and \ncomic escapades that do not involve tired tropes and stale stereotypes.  When these pieces \nhave been written, they must be performed across the United States so that young people \nengage in person, in the theatre, with these new and improved queer narratives.  The \nyouth in my study, all from a major urban area, did not list a single queer TYA play.  The \nTYA community can do better, and we must do better if we seek to spread theatre across \nthe country and value the unique voices queer youth offer. \nTheatre can be adapted in new and vibrant ways to reflect change youth \nmodalities.  Traditional narrative forms rely on a top-down approach where a playwright \nwrites a piece which is picked up by a theatre company and distributed to venues in a \nvariety of larger markets.  While a piece of theatre may be written in response to a current \nevent or specific incident, it can take years for that piece to reach young people’s eyes.  \nNew media can transmit a piece of art or expression as soon as it is performed.  Young \npeople are shifting to new media forms because they value the immediacy, their voices \nbeing presented, and trust “authentic” narratives through content-creation websites like \nYouTube, Reddit, and Tumblr.  Live theatre can tap into this shift by artists devising new \nworks with youth and performing them for their own communities.  Having youth as both \n  \n \n128 \nplaywright and performer can allow for more immediate responses to issues in their \ncommunity and educates youth about the entire creation process.  Aesthetically, creative \nchoices like direct-audience address, the use of live video, framing the performer through \nlight or set, can all enhance the message and connection with youth interests. \nA Researcher’s Reflection \n As reflection is a key component of any research project, I examine where I could \ndo better next time and offer it as advice for future researchers.  First, there are several \nitems I wish I had asked of each participant.  As I was writing this dissertation, I regretted \nnot asking their preferred gender pronouns.  As a cis-gendered male, I do not think \ngender entered my mind in this regard.  Perhaps, as a gay male and member of the \nLGBTQ+ community, I assumed that I would be able to read their preferred gender \npronouns based off their physical appearance.  This was not the case.  In retrospect, \nadding this to the forms would allow me as a researcher to be more respectful during the \nfocus group/interview process and it would make the writing process more detailed.  It \nmight also open the door for more discussions about the significance of pronouns. \n In terms of the focus groups and case studies themselves, I regret not going in as \nmuch depth as I could.  As I was listening back on the transcripts I found I missed the \nopportunity for follow-up questions.  A simply “why” or “why not” could have revealed \nmore.  Additionally, I found that I asked for quantity of responses and not quality.  The \nyoung people gave me long lists of television shows that contained queer characters but \ndid not adequately ask about which they believed to be “best” and “worst”, and then \n  \n \n129 \nunpacked what that means.  I think this would have been a gateway into deeper \ndiscussions. \n Also, I wish I had spoken with more gay males and more heterosexual, cis-gender \nyouth during the case-study process.  I feel like I had a diverse mix of young people in \nterms of race, religion, and gender identity, but actually had very few gay males and few \nheterosexual young people.  On one hand, it is valuable to give voice to those identities \nthat are less present in mainstream media and less present in previous research.  \nHowever, it also serves as a hole in my research and a perspective that would have been \nvaluable to add.   \n The most difficult part of the process was getting field sites to engage young \npeople.  I connected with schools through convenient and chain sampling and on friends’ \ncontacts with other schools to line up potential field sites.  Future researchers might find \nit advantageous to use an action research or youth participatory action research (YPAR) \nat a site with an existing relationship to the community and the student population.  This \nby no means reduces the need for permission from parents and the school’s \nadministration, but I have found that young people are more willing to talk when they \nknow and trust the researcher.  Additionally, engaging youth through a long-term study in \na YPAR model would be a next logical step.  Coming in from the outside, I did not \nnecessarily have that trust.  I felt that they trusted the cooperating teacher/staff member \nand through virtue of their relationship, I was deemed safe to speak with.  This really \ngoes down to the positionality of the researcher.  When dealing with young people, it \nmay be easier and reveal more about young people if the researcher is coming from \n  \n \n130 \nwithin the organization or community.  On the other hand, it may be that young people \ncensor themselves around authority figures or those they see as having power over them.  \nRegardless, future studies need to reach out early and often to build the partnerships for \nthis type of research.  Schools with active after-school programs or study halls or clubs \nthat meet regularly will be particularly resourceful.   \nFinal Thoughts \nThrough an ever-developing psyche, built from self-awareness, self-recognition, \nand self-exploration, young people adjust the mirror on which they view their reflection.  \nYoung people utilize their extensive and diverse social networks such as family, friends, \nreligious and school communities, and online environments as resources to better \nunderstand the narrative messages.  Finally, young people shift, grow, and adapt their \nschema to re-see narratives and adjust accordingly.  Perhaps due to the increasingly \ncomplex narrative landscapes, young people today are highly skilled evaluators of media \nand narrative messages.

I am conducting a \nresearch study for my doctoral dissertation in Theatre for Youth to examine how youth \nperceive and interact with queer narratives in the media. \n \nI am inviting your child's participation, which will involve a 45-75 minute focus group \nsession with 5-7 other youth, a questionnaire, and, potentially, a one-hour follow-up \nindividual interview. Your child's participation in this study is voluntary.  If you choose \nnot to have your child participate or to withdraw your child from the study at any time, \nthere will be no penalty and will not affect your child’s grade.  Likewise, if your child \nchooses not to participate or to withdraw from the study at any time, there will be no \npenalty.  The results of the research study may be published, but your child's name will \nnot be used.  \n \nAlthough there may be no direct benefit to your child, the possible benefit of your child's \nparticipation includes a greater understanding of the media’s role in our lives, a chance to \nexpress his/her feelings about the narratives around us, and to safely discuss his/her ideas \nwith peers.  There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to your child’s participation. \n \nThe focus group sessions and individual interviews will be audio-recorded.  These will be \nstored on a password protected computer and all written references to your child will only \ninclude pseudonyms.  All responses will be confidential.  However, due to the nature of \nfocus groups, complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. The results of this study \nmay be used in reports, presentations, or publications but your child’s name will not be \nused. \n \nIf you have any questions concerning the research study or your child's participation in \nthis study, please call me at [removed], or Dr. Stephani Etheridge Woodson at [removed].   \n \n \nSincerely, \n \nAndrew Waldron \nBy signing below, you are giving consent for your child _______________ (Child’s \nname) to participate in the above study.

You will \nbe asked how the stories about queer people and how those stories are constructed.  The \nfocus group will take between 45 and 75 minutes, depending on how our conversation is \ngoing.  Additionally, you may be asked if you want to participate in an individual \ninterview.  This will be between you and I, will give you a chance to talk more about the \nqueer narratives you’ve encountered, and may last up to an hour. In both the focus group \nsessions and interviews, I will be audio-recording our conversations, so that I can listen to \nit again later.  You do not have to answer any questions that make you uncomfortable.  \nWhen I write about these focus groups and interviews, I will not use your name \nanywhere.   \n \nYou do not have to be in this study. No one will be mad at you if you decide not to do \nthis study. Even if you start the study, you can stop later if you want. You may ask \nquestions about the study at any time. \n \nIf you decide to be in the study, I will not tell anyone else how you respond or act as part \nof the study.

    "abstract": "abstract: This research study examines the interaction between youth queer narratives and young people through examining my core research question, How do young people engage, interpret, and respond to queer narratives?  Applying a feminist narrative analysis to examine the qualitative data, I propose a methodological research shift where the voices of youth are valued as content experts; an artistic shift that moves content-creation away from a top down traditional media model and towards a youth-centered new media approach for art making; an aesthetic shift away from over-used stereotypes, tropes, and stale representations and instead innovate to represent intersectional, spectrum-based diversity of the LGBTQ+ experience.\n\nThis qualitative research study utilizes questionnaires, focus groups, and case study interviews, to engage adolescent perceptions of queer narratives.  The youth, ranging in ages from 15 to 18 years old and living in the Phoenix, Arizona metro area, explore and examine LGBTQ+ themes, characters, plots in traditional and new media.  \n\nMy dissertation examines youth interactions with queer narratives through three chapters.  These address themes of: character, identity, and representation; plot and the search for accuracy; and the symbiotic exchange between narrative and community.  Throughout the dissertation, young people analyze narratives, reflect on their own lives, and envision the future of youth queer narrative.  The youth describe a move away from traditional media and towards new media platforms with user-created content, social network interaction, and the sharing of common experiences with peers.  Finally, I examine the implications of both the research findings and the methodology on the future of youth-engaged qualitative research, as well as the performing arts.Dissertation/ThesisDoctoral Dissertation Theatre 201",
