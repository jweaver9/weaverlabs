In discussing classical Athens David Halperin argues that “sex did not express inward dispositions or inclinations so much as it served to position social actors in the places assigned to them.” What role did sexual penetration play in categorizing sexuality for people in classical Athens? How did these categories work to reinforce already existing social hierarchies? What problems do these categories cause for modern historians looking to study Athenian sexuality?

Understand the different “prisms” of historiography 2. Begin to compare and contrast different historiographical viewpoints. Objectives were met. I began by answering any questions about the movie and essay. I also explained the butch and femme cultural of pre-Stonewall lesbians. I was asked about the etymology of lesbian, and I gave a brief answer, but then emailed an etymology I found online. I have yet to find a satisfactory etymology of LGBT terms, but the one online seemed to match what I had found on my own.  I then drew three different “prisms” (triangles) on the board and we started with D’Emilio. I asked questions about what he covered in order to hint at the interpretation. Though no one came out with “Marxism” (as you said!) they did get close to it. They got Kissack and Before Stonewall much more easily, which was somewhat surprising because I had talked about Marxism a lot more than radical politics. Once we had the prisms we then focused on the content of the prism. They were able to easily          I then passed around a two page (front and back) set of readings from three different authors. Two disagreed with each other explicitly, while the other dealt with the question of whether or not urban areas caused gay identity community and politics. We then had an excellent discussion about why the ideas brought up in the essays could take different social and political goals, even though they focus on the same history. They were able to see how John Howard’s research showed gay community formation outside the inner city, so hopefully they will be able to challenge that when they write their essays.  Historiography is very difficult so I was happy that they picked up on the different interpretations of the readings. On a different note, they asked for their quizzes back at the beginning of class, and I forgot to hand them out at the end. Not a single one of my students reminded me at the end! I sent them an email thanking them for being so polite with my forgetfulness and then released the grades on Sakai. Usually students are pushy about getting things back so I was shocked that they let it slip by.  1. Answer any questions about the video 2. Break down D’Emilio and Kissack’s prisms 3. Individual work of reading and analyzing different historiographical interpretations from a set of readings I brought to class. Evaluation Rubric   Class Title (on Syllabus): Library Meeting/LGBT Urban Centers                  Date: October 20, 2011   Class Reading: Boag, Peter. “’Does Portland Need a Homophile Society?’ Gay Culture and Activism in the Rose City between World War II and Stonewall. Oregon Historical Quarterly 105 no. 1 (Spring, 2004): 6-39.  Before Class   Objective(s) for the day:    After Class  Evaluation of Class Objective(s):     Evaluation of Class Activities:                      1. Learn how to do modern library research 2. Cover anarchist thoughts about homosexuality 3. Understand the important events in post WWII Portland that changed how people think about sexuality and homosexuality 1. Have Amanda come in and do her thing. 2. Cover anarchist views of homosexuality by going over the Goldman source questions 3. Have students list the features they found interesting about the changes since WWII The first two were covered well, the last one will be addressed below. Amanda came in and showed them how to do some modern research, and answered a couple of their research questions. Besides my computer’s video port breaking (Hume’s curse) it seemed to go fine. Again she is a wonderful resource. I hope to use reference librarians like her again in the future.  We then went over the anarchist questions. Most of the class had done the questions, so we had a good conversation among those who did the work. With specific questions it was easy to focus group discussion. When we got to the question of “should gay people look to find other gays in history, in order to show a continuous narrative?” there was the first strong debate among the class. They broke from the raising hands mentality and four people went back and forth about it. This was excellent. Since homework is not graded I was not surprised that some people had not done it. However, I was more surprised at what came next.  After finishing up the anarchist talk I asked the students what stuck out to them about the reading, and I was met with a set of blank faces.  In response, I had them take five minutes and individually write down what they found interesting, what questions they had, etc . As they were “doing” this I found no one writing much down, and no one had the article with them. I then adopted what I saw in Dr. Widell’s class and started calling on people to answer questions. Even the good students admitted to not having done the reading. Only one student was resistant, saying once he got 10 pages in and realized it was 35 pages he stopped reading. This is problem child, and I suspect he will be dropping the course, and it was best to ignore him.   Seeing that this would go nowhere, and we only had 15 minutes left, I gave them the brief “you need to respect the work we do in this class” lecture and told them to come prepared for both readings on Tuesday. They will have a difficult quiz in response to this to make sure they actually do the reading. Had there been more time in class I would have made a bigger fuss, and attempted to teach the material, but because it was late I did not find it necessary to make them feel more embarrassed about it. There was a collective disappointed mentality, and I think they got the point.  ADAPTATIONS • Academic Integrity • Ensure all papers hold up to university’s standards  • What do you do when no one has done the reading?  • Drop in class size • Undergraduates do not believe professors who says their class is a lot of work!  • Allowed us to work closer together                                                                 The Assignment As you head home from celebrating the completion of your last essay your phone goes off. On the other end of the line is Barack Obama! He read the history you wrote about your issue and wants to know what he should do about it. This is your chance to make real change on your issue! As you talk with the President you realize that he has no understanding of how people conceptualize sexuality and is fresh out of ideas for practical change. To help the President you must do two things: (1) Help him understand that this issue is affected by how people think about gender and sexuality. (2) Offer some specific changes you think need to be made. The Content  For this essay you will need to pull on a variety of things we covered this semester. First, you must frame this issue in the context of how people conceptualize sexuality (think essentialism vs. constructionism and Boswell’s sexual taxonomies).  Second, using this information and the history you put together for Essay 3, make a case for specific changes that should be made in relation to your issue. These can be large social or political changes or changes at an interpersonal level.    The content of this paper (format, resources, etc) is up to you. Since President Obama never took a course in the history of homosexuality you will need to explain different concepts at a level he can understand. Most likely this will involve grounding theory in some sort of practical example. This can be an expansion of your last paper, but you should include class materials relevant to your topic.  You may not need to do additional research, but you need to use enough scholarly resources to make your point.    The Schedule Paper Due:  December 20, 2011  •  Essays are due in Sakai by 05:00PM. •  Late essays will NOT be accepted.  The Format •  Essays should be around 2000 words. •  Essays should be double-spaced, one-inch margins and 12-point Times New Roman font. •  Essays should include both a title page and a bibliography. HPR 107: Introduction to LGBTQ History Lippitt Hall, Room 303 Tuesday & Thursday, 9:30am-10:45am  Instructor: Brian Stack Email: bstackuri@gmail.com Phone: (413)949-6227  Office Hours: Mondays 12-2 in Lippitt 301H or by appointment  Course Description:  This course will examine the history of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people in ancient, medieval and modern times.  As this is a broad topic, we will focus on large time periods and the majority’s attitudes towards LGBTQ people. We will attempt to define the social construction of sexuality regarding LGBTQ people, and how terms such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer are effected by the time periods in which they are being discussed. With this foundation we will then closely study the history of LGBTQ people in the United States in order to identify variations in personal and political identity. The course will also examine the effects that policies towards LGBTQ people had on people identified, or assumed to be, LGBTQ.  Required Text: Mary Lynn Rampolla, A Pocket Guide to Writing in History, 6th ed. (Boston: Bedford Books/St.  Martin's Press, 2009)  Course Objectives: I consider the following objectives to be essential:  Developing the ability to critically read a variety of writings from different time periods.  Learning how to analyze and critically evaluate different points of ideas and arguments.  Developing the ability to express unique ideas both orally and in writing.  Understanding different methods for analyzing primary and secondary sources.  I consider the following objectives to be important:  Examining human differences through a variety of course materials.  Acquiring research skills through the use of print and online journals and resources.   Grading Criteria: Students will be graded on a variety of course materials to show their understanding of the history and theories that they encounter. The grade breakdown is as follows:   Informed Participation & Quizzes 20%  Papers     60%  Final Exam    20%   Informed Participation 20%: Attendance for this course will not be taken, however participation will be counted. You will earn participation points through informed participation. Participation will be gauged by the content and frequency of your contributions as well as your score on in-class quizzes. In-class quizzes will be unannounced and based on the reading for that day. There will be roughly 8 pop quizzes, of which 6 will be counted towards the final grade. Make-ups for missed quizzes will not be given unless you have notified me of your absence BEFORE CLASS.     Papers 60%: There will be three 1250-1500 word essays for this class, each worth 20% of the total grade. These papers should show an understanding of the course readings as well as an analysis of the historiography of the subject. I also expect these papers to pursue and original line of thinking in relation to the ideas and discussions that have been brought up in class. Each paper will require at least some research outside of class. Criteria for these papers will be given prior to each due-date. Each paper will be due in hardcopy at the beginning of class on the day it is due. Now is the best time to invest in a personal stapler.   Final Exam 20%: The final exam will encourage students to apply the course material in a creative way to a modern problem facing LGBTQ people or LGBTQ movements. This project will be done individually and should combine multiple course readings in an original and creative way. More details about the final will be given closer to the due-date.  Final Grading Policy: A=94-100  A-=90-93 B+=87-89  B=84-86  B-=80-83  C+77-79  C=74-77 C-=70-73  D+=67-69  D=60-66   Anti-Bias Statement:  Each member of the University community has the responsibility to foster an environment of acceptance, mutual respect, and understanding.

Your friend heard about this new Students Teaching Students initiative and asks you what you think of the class so far. Naturally, you begin to rant and rave about the class and all the wonderful things you have learned.  You tell her that the major issue for the course, so far, is the debate between essentialist and constructionist views of sexuality in the ancient world.  Your friend, however, hates uncertainty and wants to know whether essentialism or constructionism is the best way to view ancient sexualities. Fortunately you are equipped to deal with this issue. You agree to write your friend an essay explaining each of these viewpoints and then making a case for which view of sexuality you support, including the pros and cons of each view.  If you do not support either view in full, explain why neither view is correct, and offer a solution for how to view sexuality in the ancient world. As part of the agreement, you offer to use two journal articles/book chapters/ essays that were not used in class. The Content  In order for your friend to understand your essay you will need to address the following questions, as well as other pertinent information:  •  What is an “essentialist” view of sexuality and what evidence to we have to support this view? What are some problems associated with this viewpoint? •  What is an “constructionist” view of sexuality and what evidence to we have to support this view? What are some problems associated with this viewpoint? •  What are some of the major debates between essentialists and constructionists about the history of sexuality? •  What primary and secondary sources are available for you to make an argument?

As you’re waiting for your drink you run into Amanda Izenstark from the library. She asks how the class is going and wants to know what you have learned about the formation of gay rights organizing.  Inspired by your conversation you decide to write her an essay explaining the issues concerning lesbian and gay people before Stonewall.  To do this you will need to rely on the historiography of the subject. This means you will need to identify different LGBT historians and highlight where they agree, or disagree, about the issues raised in the readings. The Content  This will be a historiographical essay that asks you to compare and contrast different interpretations among historians. Some of the questions to ask include:  • Was the period between WWII and Stonewall a period of silence and isolation for LGBT people in the United States? •  How effective was the bar culture in working with homophile organizations? •  How did capitalist and Marxist interpretations affect how lesbians and gays formed their identities? • Did the philosophy of the early homophile movement include all kinds of LGBT people?  This essay should create a narrative that explains the complex social phenomena that led gay people to organize. Therefore you will need a thesis that pulls together these different interpretations into one coherent narrative. You will need to show the evidence these historians use and then weigh their interpretations against each other. Consult Rampolla pgs. 32-34 for questions about doing historiographical essays.   To assist you in finding other historians on the subject, here are some authors for your searching: George Chauncey Jr., Estelle Freedman, John Howard, David Carter, Marcia Gallo, Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy, Madeline D. Davis, Michael Bronski, Douglas M. Charles, Allan Berube, David A. Reichard, Johnathan Ned Katz,  Martin Meeker. Note: If you are having trouble finding historians to use, consult the footnotes and references in the articles from class.

HPR 107: Introduction to LGBTQ History                                               Essay #3: The History of the Issues  The Assignment After class you and a group of your friends head to the Memorial Union to get some coffee between classes. As you get closer to the union you see a group of people standing outside with large banners. Interested in the ruckus your group wanders over to the protestors. As you get close you realize they are holding signs and handing out literature against an LGBT rights issue that you find important. As you begin to talk to them about the issue you find out that they are basing their information on biased, homophobic history. Infuriated at their lack of knowledge about gay history you set off to detail the history of the issue so that you can have a conversation based on facts. The Content  The essay that you write should compare the social, political and economic concerns behind the issue. Focus your analysis on the post-World War II-era, and bring it as close to the present as possible. It should show what changes, if any, have been made over time (relating to your issue) as well as the rationale behind these experiences. When possible you should concern both heterosexual and non-heterosexual approaches to the issue. By the end of your essay the reader should know the history behind the current issue. Be sure not to moralize about the issue, or offer conclusions as to how to solve the problem (this will be the focus of your final).  Instead, this essay should be focused on giving history to an issue relating to LGBT people. This means you will need to include important dates, laws, figures, court rulings, organizations, etc. in your analysis.  NOTE: The issue you choose for this essay must also be the one you use for your final essay. That is why you need to pick an issue you find important.  The Schedule Issue Due:  November 28, 2011 • Submit to me by email your top three choices for LGBT issue.  Meeting: November 29, 2011- December 4, 2011 • Topics will be given out on November 29th. You are required to meet with me during the week of the 28th for help in finding resources that relate to your subject.  Paper Due:  December 8, 2011  • Essays are due in hardcopy at 09:30 • Essays turned in after that time will be considered late • Essays will not be accepted after the end of the day.

The Format • Essays should be between 1250-1500 words. • You must include at least five different sources relating to your topic. These should be academic journals, book chapters, scholarly articles, etc.  • Essays should be double-spaced with one-inch margins with 12-point Times New Roman font. • Essays should include both a title page and a bibliography. • Notes and references should be in Chicago Style.

HPR 107: Introduction to LGBTQ History                                            Final Essay: Creating Change  The Assignment As you head home from celebrating the completion of your last essay your phone goes off. On the other end of the line is Barack Obama! He read the history you wrote about your issue and wants to know what he should do about it. This is your chance to make real change on your issue! As you talk with the President you realize that he has no understanding of how people conceptualize sexuality and is fresh out of ideas for practical change. To help the President you must do two things: (1) Help him understand that this issue is affected by how people think about gender and sexuality. (2) Offer some specific changes you think need to be made. The Content  For this essay you will need to pull on a variety of things we covered this semester. First, you must frame this issue in the context of how people conceptualize sexuality (think essentialism vs. constructionism and Boswell’s sexual taxonomies).  Second, using this information and the history you put together for Essay 3, make a case for specific changes that should be made in relation to your issue. These can be large social or political changes or changes at an interpersonal level.    The content of this paper (format, resources, etc) is up to you. Since President Obama never took a course in the history of homosexuality you will need to explain different concepts at a level he can understand. Most likely this will involve grounding theory in some sort of practical example. This can be an expansion of your last paper, but you should include class materials relevant to your topic.  You may not need to do additional research, but you need to use enough scholarly resources to make your point.    The Schedule Paper Due:  December 20, 2011  • Essays are due in Sakai by 05:00PM. • Late essays will NOT be accepted.  The Format • Essays should be around 2000 words. • Essays should be double-spaced, one-inch margins and 12-point Times New Roman font. • Essays should include both a title page and a bibliography. • Notes and references should be in Chicago Style.

    "abstract": "When the Students Teaching Students program called for submissions for student created courses I jumped at the opportunity to learn and share with a group of peers dedicated to a subject. The close to year long process culminated in the first Students Teaching Students course at URI, focusing on the history of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people: HPR 107: Introduction to LGBTQ History.\nJust getting ready to teach was a multifaceted process, since I tend to fluctuate between ravenously seizing every book I can get my hands on and devising practical applications for that intellectual knowledge. First I needed to create a syllabus that represented what I wanted to teach, which in my case involved questions in the field of Gay and Lesbian studies. Once the syllabus was accepted I set about creating lesson plans and course materials to help get across the ideas I found so important. For example, I looked at questions around the construction of sexual and gender identities, differing sexual customs and practices, and the struggle to create minority identities in America. After months of preparation - including serving as a class assistant for PHL 205: Philosophical Topics where I studied and practiced pedagogical techniques for my course - I was finally ready to teach on my own.\nThough the preparation for this course was important, the strongest benefit of this project was uncovered through the actual day to day teaching. Twice a week I was able to meet and discuss my favorite ideas with an engaged group of brilliant honors students who worked hard to sustain our common vision for the course. While creating group work, quizzes, essays and lectures helped me process, digest and communicate about the material, interaction with other students, and my evaluation of that interaction, prompted the greatest growth in me as a teacher. My pedagogical preparation was invaluable to my success in this project yet it was though actually working with students that I learned to teach.\nThis project allowed me to test the waters of my field, and I managed to swim to the finish. Not only did I vastly expand my knowledge of LGBTQ history; I developed pedagogical techniques that will sustain me throughout my professional career, a career as a professor of history. Students Teaching Students allowed me to step out of the armchair of academia into the real world, to discuss issues of critical importance to our society and to begin the process of knowledge and understanding that lies at the heart of overcoming oppression",
