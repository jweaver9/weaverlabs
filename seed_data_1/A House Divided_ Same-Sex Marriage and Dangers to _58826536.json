Wardle† I.  INTRODUCTION Can the United States long endure as a patchwork quilt of states in which same-sex marriages are prohibited in some states while simultaneously permitted in others? Will the federal government, through congressional action or judicial rulings, impose one regime or the other on all of the people in all of the states? For example, in 2004 and 2006, resolutions proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States that would define marriage nationally as the union between a man and a woman were considered (and in 2006 received majority votes in both houses).1 However, since 2009 a bill to repeal the federal Defense of Marriage Act (with 108 co-signers) has been pending in the U.S. House of Representatives.2 What are the implications of the legalization of same-sex marriage for religious liberties? For example, President Obama’s nomination of distinguished law professor Chai Feldblum to serve on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sparked intense controversy, at least in part because of her writings that advocate giving preference to sexual liberty over religious liberty.3 These and related issues are the focus of this Article.                                                                                                                             † Bruce C.

As of March 2, 2010, Professor Feldblum’s nomination still had not been confirmed by the 538 LIBERTY UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 4:537   This Article consists of four main parts after this Introduction. Part II reviews the status of same-sex marriage in the United States of America and throughout the world. There is a strong movement to legalize same-sex marriage in this country and globally, but there has also been a counter-movement, a reaction against same-sex marriage, which has had a much greater impact on law and policy. In addition, extra-legal indicia of public opinion also show a general rejection of same-sex marriage in most sectors of society, although the opinion and policy-forming elites are a notable exception to that consensus. Part III argues that the “house-divided” metaphor is aptly applicable to the situation that the United States currently faces, where some states have narrowly defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman while others have more broadly redefined marriage as the union of any two people, including those of the same gender. Like slavery, same-sex marriage is a root paradigm-defining issue. In the end, one group or the other will prevail because both realize that the other is a threat to the institution they wish to preserve or establish. Part III discusses some recent examples and incidents that reveal this conflict and the incompatibility between traditional conjugal marriage and same-sex marriage, and it highlights several examples that show how religious liberty in particular is in jeopardy. Part IV presents some arguments for why the protection of marriage as the union of a man and a woman is a fundamental civil right and a basic human right. This Part reviews the precedents as well as the concepts that support this notion in order to draw a relationship between the protection of conjugal marriage and the protection of human dignity. The author also notes the structural significance that the protection of marriage as the union of a man and a woman has as the institution that protects the foundation (virtue) of the scaffolding of individual rights and liberties in our constitutional form of government, as well as the dangers posed by the erosion of the constitutional principle of separation of powers. Part V presents the author’s concluding reflections and recommendations. The suggestion that dual-gender marital families and same-sex unions can casually coexist within the institution of marriage over                                                                                                                            Senate, despite approval months earlier by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, because at least one senator had placed a hold on her confirmation vote.

For further discussion of Professor Feldblum’s views about the priority of sexual liberty over religious liberty, see discussion infra Part III. 2010] A HOUSE DIVIDED 539   any significant period of time, or that such arrangements are good for society, is dubious at best. Same-sex marriage, like slavery, is an aggressively transforming social influence, and it does not shrink voluntarily. Thus, the clash of marriage systems is unavoidable. Efforts should be taken now to reduce the casualties of that conflict and to prevent further erosion of the institution of marriage, of the society it anchors, and of the fundamental rights embodied in the institution of marriage. II.  A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ISSUE A. The Status of the Movement To Legalize Same-Sex Marriage and Civil Unions in the United States of America and the World The past decade has seen the coming-of-age of a global movement to legalize same-sex marriage and marriage-equivalent same-sex civil unions. These two legal movements are functionally equivalent. Same-sex marriage is marriage—period. It is fully marriage in both substance and in label. Same-sex civil unions (occasionally—as in California, Nevada and Washington state—denominated “domestic partnerships”)4 are treated the same as marriage in substance, with “the same” full civil rights, benefits, and privileges as marriage,5 but without the marriage label.6                                                                                                                             4. The term “civil unions” is commonly understood to mean domestic relationships of same-sex couples that have all of the same legal rights and benefits as traditional marriage, and that is how the term is used in this Article. See OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY, Civil Union, Draft Additions June 2008, available at http://dictionary.oed.com/ (search for “civil” in word search; then scroll down to “civil union,” “civil marriage,” and “civil partnership”) (linking “civil union” to “civil marriage” and “civil partnership,” thus combining the idea of a secular (non-religious) marriage with “a legally recognized relationship similar to but distinct from marriage, available in certain jurisdictions to homosexual couples who are prohibited from marrying . . . .”). The term “domestic partnership” is commonly used to refer to a legal relationship with few or limited couple-rights, but it also is occasionally used as another term for full marriage-equivalent relationships (full “civil unions”) (as in California and Washington state); thus, “domestic partnership” encompasses a wide range of legally recognized non-marital (usually same-sex) relationships. See OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY, Domestic Partner, Draft Revision Sept. 2007, available at http://dictionary.oed.com/ (search for “domestic” in word search; then scroll down to “domestic partner”) (defining “domestic partner” as, inter alia, “a person officially registered as such, and so entitled to (some of) the same legal rights or employee benefits as a spouse”); see also CAL. FAM. CODE § 297 (West 2004); WASH. REV. CODE § 26.60.015 (2009).  5. See, e.g., CAL. FAM. CODE § 297 (West 2004); N.H. REV. STAT. ANN. § 457:1-a (Supp. 2009); N.J. STAT. ANN. §§ 26A:81-1 to -13 (2009); N.J. STAT. ANN. § 37:1-28 (2009); OR. REV. STAT. ANN. § 11.106 (West 2008) (references and annotations); WASH. REV. CODE 540 LIBERTY UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 4:537   As Appendix A.1 shows, same-sex marriage is now legal in the United States in five states (ten percent of the states) and the District of Columbia.7 In five other states (another ten percent of the states), statutes have been adopted creating new legal domestic status relationships for same-sex couples that are equivalent to marriage but are called something else (usually “civil unions”).8 Six additional states (twelve percent of the states) have extended some specific, limited relational rights and benefits to same-sex couples (often called “domestic partner” or “reciprocal beneficiary” benefits or registries), but they do not provide marriage-equivalent legal status or benefits based upon these limited rights.9 In summary, same-sex couples are allowed to marry in one-tenth of the states and also in the twenty-seventh largest city, Washington, D.C. They may register for marriage-equivalent rights and status in another one-eighth of the country. However, marriage-equivalent legal status or legal couple marital benefits are not extended to same-gender couples in over three-fourths of the states.10 Internationally, as Appendix A.2 shows, out of the 192 sovereign nations recognized by the United Nations,11 only seven nations (3.6% of all nations)                                                                                                                            § 26.60.015 (2009); see also CONN. GEN. STAT. § 46b-38oo (2009); VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 15, §§ 1204, 1301–06 (2002). See generally Perry Dane, A Holy Secular Institution, 58 EMORY L.J. 1123 (2009). Vermont and Connecticut recently upgraded same-sex civil unions to same-sex marriages. See VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 15, § 8 (Supp. 2009); Kerrigan v. Comm’r of Pub. Health, 957 A.2d 407 (Conn. 2008) (mandating marriage for same-sex couples); 2009 Vt. Adv. Legis. Serv. 3 (LexisNexis) (pertaining to S. 115, 70th Sess. (Vt. 2009)).  6. Indeed, in Washington state, the legal relationship for same-sex couples created by the legislature (and approved by voters) was called by the sponsors and popularly the “everything but marriage” bill; it gave same-sex couples “everything”—every legal right of marriage—except the label of “marriage.” See Rachel La Corte, Lawmakers Announce ‘Everything but Marriage’ Bill, SEATTLE TIMES, Jan. 28, 2009, http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008678540_ apwaxgrdomesticpartnerships2ndldwritethru.html (last visited Feb. 9, 2010).  7. See infra Appendix A.1.  8. These states are California (arguably still allowed after In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008)), New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington. See CAL. FAM. CODE § 297 (West 2004); CONN. GEN. STAT. § 46b-38oo (2009); N.H. REV. STAT. ANN. § 457:1-a (Supp. 2009); N.J. STAT. ANN. § 37:1-28 (2009); OR. REV. STAT. ANN. § 11.106 (West 2008) (references and annotations); VT. STAT. ANN. tit. 15, § 1201 (2002).  9. See infra Appendix A.1 (noting that Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, and Wisconsin offer narrowly-tailored packages of specific rights (not equivalent to marriage) to same-sex couples).  10. See infra Appendix B.1 (showing states that deny legal recognition to same-sex couples).  11. United Nations, Growth in United Nations Membership, 1945-Present, http://www.un.org/ en/members/growth.shtml (last visited Feb. 7, 2009). 2010] A HOUSE DIVIDED 541   allow same-sex marriage;12 one of those nations plus twelve additional nations (another 6.2%) provide legal benefits to same-sex couples that are largely equivalent to the legal benefits provided to married couples.13 In summary, nearly ten percent (9.8%) of all sovereign nations (mostly western European nations or former colonies) provide same-sex couples with marital or marriage-equivalent legal status. B. The Response: The Status of the Prohibition of Same-Sex Marriage and Civil Unions in the United States of America and the World Rejection of same-sex marriage and marriage-equivalent unions reflects a much stronger and broader grassroots movement in America and internationally than the movement to legalize same-sex marriage or equivalent civil unions. As Appendix B.1 shows, thirty states (sixty percent of all American states) have passed constitutional amendments protecting marriage as the union of husband and wife in the past twelve years, including nineteen state constitutional amendments that also prohibit the legal recognition of marriage-equivalent same-sex civil unions.14 At least forty-two states have passed their own “defense of marriage” policies by statute, constitutional amendment, or both.15 Over forty American states have explicitly and unequivocally rejected both same-sex marriage and any marriage-like legal status or marital benefits for same-sex couples by                                                                                                                             12. See infra Appendix A.2.  13. Another seven nations (3.6% of nations) provide some limited benefits to same-sex couples. See infra Appendix A.2.  14. ALA. CONST. amend. 774; ALASKA CONST. art.

Thirty-seven nations (nineteen percent of the 192 sovereign nations recognized by the United Nations) have constitutional provisions that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.20 All but one of those thirty-seven national constitutions has been adopted since 1970.21 By contrast, no national constitution expressly protects or explicitly requires same-sex marriage.22 Additionally, same-sex marriage is prohibited by statute, common law, or binding legal custom in many other nations that do not explicitly forbid same-sex marriage in their constitutions.23 The overwhelming global rejection of same-sex unions is well-grounded. For over sixty years, explicit constitutional protection of male-female marital families has been considered one of the foundations necessary for the nurturing and protection of human rights. For example, the Universal                                                                                                                             16. See Lynn D. Wardle, A Response to the “Conservative Case” for Same-Sex Marriage: Same-Sex Marriage and the Tragedy of the Commons, 22 BYU J. PUB. L. 441 (2008); see also Monte Neil Stewart, Marriage Facts, 31 HARV. J.L. & PUB. POL’Y 313 (2008).  17. The only states that do not bar same-sex marriage by positive law or judicial decision are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, Maine, and New Mexico. For developments since May 2009, see infra Appendices A.1, A.2, B.1, and B.2.  18. See supra notes 14-15 and accompanying text. Additionally, some states have other statutory or judicial language that appears to recognize marriage as the union of husband and wife. Some of the rejection of same-sex marriage may be due to the anti-democratic tactics, such as litigation to judicially compel legalization of same-sex marriage, employed by advocates of same-sex marriage. See generally Gerald N. Rosenberg, Saul Alinsky and the Litigation Campaign To Win the Right to Same-Sex Marriage, 42 J. MARSHALL L. REV. 643 (2009).  19. See, e.g., Lewis v. Harris, 908 A.2d 196 (N.J. 2006); Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1 (N.Y. 2006); Chambers v. Ormiston, 935 A.2d 956 (R.I. 2007).  20. See infra Appendix B.2 (identifying constitutional provisions recognizing marriage as the union between a man and a woman).  21. Japan, whose constitution was adopted in 1946, is the other nation with a constitutional provision limiting marriage to male-female couples.  22. However, by judicial interpretation of equality provisions, not marriage provisions, Canadian and South African courts have required legal recognition of same-sex marriage. See Harrison v. Canada, [2005] 290 N.B.R.2d 70 (Can.); Minister of Home Affairs v. Fourie, 2006 (3) BCLR 355 (CC) (S. Afr.) (judgment decided on Jan. 12, 2005, and delivered on Dec. 1, 2005).  23. See generally Wardle, supra note 16, at 443-46. 2010] A HOUSE DIVIDED 543   Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that “[t]he family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.”24 Similar statements about the foundational importance and specially-protected role of families are found in dozens of other international conventions, compacts, and instruments.25 C. Other Indicia of Public Rejection of Same-Sex Marriage In addition to the status of the law, there are many other indicia of strong and predominant popular opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage both in the United States and globally. To begin, there was much publicity surrounding the legalization of same-sex marriage in the first six months of 2009 in Iowa (by judicial decree),26 and in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine (by legislation). However, New England is the most liberal region of the country, so the legalization of same-sex marriage in three New England states by legislation shortly after the Obama campaign’s electoral sweep in 2008 was not surprising. It was expected to happen sooner or later. All three of these New England states already had laws that provided significant legal status and benefits to same-sex couples.27 By legalizing same-sex marriage, these states only expanded their prior pro-same-sex-couple policies. They did not suddenly “cross the aisle” from being states that were pro-traditional-marriage to states that are now pro-same-sex-marriage. In the three New England states that legalized same-sex marriage, the Democratic Party controls both houses of the legislature, and in two states the governor is also a Democrat.28 So the legalization of same-sex marriage                                                                                                                             24.

POST, Aug. 28, 2009, available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/ 544 LIBERTY UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 4:537   may tell more about internal Democratic party priorities than general American marriage policy values. The legalization of same-sex marriage in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire occurred by legislative vote. Current and subsequent legislatures in those states can repeal same-sex marriage just as easily as it was enacted. If Democrats lose control in the next election in any of these states, same-sex marriage could be overturned as suddenly as it was created. Indeed, efforts are already afoot to repeal same-sex marriage in New Hampshire.29 (Obviously, many grass-roots Democrats do not support same-sex marriage, but it is clear that party activists who do favor same-sex marriage presently control the party in New England.) There are several indications that the legislative legalization of same-sex marriage in New England was in disregard of the will of the people. The most obvious example is Maine. The Maine Constitution allows a “people’s veto” of legislation if enough signatures are gathered within ninety days of adjournment of the legislative session.30 A citizens group submitted over 100,000 signatures on petitions calling for a “people’s veto” of the law legalizing same-sex marriage (nearly twice as many as the 55,000 required                                                                                                                            wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/27/AR2009082701977.html; The Vermont Legislature Legislative Directory: Representatives 2009-2010 Legislative Session, http://www.leg.state.vt.us/lms/legdir/ alpha.asp?Body=H (last visited May 14, 2010) (listing Vermont state representatives, a majority of whom are Democrats, and their party affiliations); The Vermont Legislature Legislative Directory: Senators 2009-2010 Legislative Session, http://www.leg.state.vt.us/lms/legdir/alpha.asp?Body=S (last visited May 14, 2010) (listing Vermont state senators, a majority of whom are democrats, and their party affiliation).

IV, pt. 3, §§ 17-18. 2010] A HOUSE DIVIDED 545   to put the matter on the ballot).31 As a result, Maine’s same-sex marriage legislation came before Maine voters before it actually became law. Despite the fact that supporters of gay marriage who opposed the “people’s veto” significantly outspent the opponents of same-sex marriage, Maine voters passed the “people’s veto” of same-sex marriage by a vote of nearly fifty-three percent to forty-seven percent—a decisive political statement and rebuff of the legislature.32 Similarly, the enactment of same-sex marriage involved some dirty politics in New Hampshire. There, the state House and Senate passed different bills, so they went before a conference committee. Senate Rules require senators from both parties to be on that committee, which must unanimously approve any compromise bill.33 When the sole Republican senator on the committee opposed the same-sex marriage bill, the Democratic Senate President removed her and replaced her with a Democrat to insure unanimous approval, in apparent violation of the rules.34 Thus, legalizing same-sex marriage may not have represented the will of the people but the will of back-room political power-brokers. The value of resolving the issue by constitutional amendment (as thirty states have done) is obvious. However, New England state constitutions are famously anti-populist. They were written by people who distrusted democracy, who feared “mob rule,” and who favored control by a governing political establishment. Thus, passage of constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage anywhere in New England is unlikely in the near future. Voters in New Hampshire and Vermont will not be able to do what voters in more than sixty percent of American states have done—cast their ballots to decide whether to protect marriage by a constitutional amendment and end the politics.                                                                                                                             31.

However, in both states, the governors’ vetoes were overturned and the bills became law—by a single vote. If just one vote had changed in each legislature, same-sex marriage would not be legal in Vermont nor civil unions in Nevada. This underscores how crucial a single vote can be in America’s democratic system. The Vermont legislator, who initially voted against same-sex marriage but later switched his vote to override the governor’s veto, indicated that he changed his vote in response to letters from his constituents, who favored same-sex marriage by a slight margin.37 This also highlights how important it is for concerned, responsible citizens to communicate appropriately with their elected public officials. In April of 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court unanimously forced same-sex marriage on its citizens in Varnum v. Brien.38 This decision is a stunning example of judicial elitism and disregard for the separation of power. It also shows why it is necessary to adopt state marriage amendments protecting marriage—to prevent judges from illegitimately mandating same-sex marriage. Public opinion polling immediately following the Varnum decision showed that Iowans opposed same-sex marriage by nearly a two-to-one ratio.39 A Des Moines Register poll conducted September 14, 2009, nearly six months later, stated that: “The poll shows that 26 percent of Iowans favor April’s unanimous court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, 43 percent oppose it and 31 percent don’t care much or are not sure.”40 The same poll showed that if Iowans could vote on a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, “forty-one percent say they would vote for a ban, and 40 percent say they would vote to continue gay marriage. . . .”41 The                                                                                                                             35.

Id. 2010] A HOUSE DIVIDED 547   report further noted: “The most intensity about the issue shows up among opponents. The percentage of Iowans who say they strongly oppose gay marriage (35 percent) is nearly double the percentage who say they strongly favor it (18 percent).”42 A voter backlash in Iowa is likely in 2010. Iowa also has anti-populist constitutional amendment rules,43 but Iowans are provided the opportunity to vote on whether to call a constitutional convention once per decade.44 2010 is the next year for Iowans to vote on whether to call such a convention.45 Thus, same-sex marriage may not be a “settled” issue in Iowa quite yet. Likewise, there are clear signs that the public still opposes same-sex marriage on the west coast. After much blustering and threatening and beginning to collect signatures, major same-sex marriage organizations in California announced that they will not seek a proposed amendment in 2010 to overturn Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage and is currently being challenged in federal district court.46 The reason given by the spokesman for Equality California was that public opinion had not changed in the year after the people of California decisively voted for Proposition 8 and against same-sex marriage.47                                                                                                                             42.

None of the states that legalized same-sex marriage in 2009 were among the thirty states that previously adopted constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is still forbidden in over forty states, by constitutional amendment in nearly two-thirds of the states. Polls show that Americans still consistently oppose legalizing same-sex marriage.48 Public opinion polling experts underscore that there is no massive trend supporting the legalization of same-sex marriage. In a paper prepared for presentation at the 2009 American Political Science Association annual meeting, Gregory B. Lewis and Charles W. Gossett noted: “A slender but stable majority has labeled homosexual sex ‘morally wrong’ in polls throughout the past quarter-century. In 22 Gallup polls since 1977, the percentage saying homosexual relations should be illegal has fluctuated around 45% rather than trending strongly downward.”49 They further explained: “Opposition to same-sex marriage is strong and reasonably stable—55% to 65% oppose it and only 30% to 35% favor it. Brewer and Wilcox conclude that ‘from the early 1990s to the present . . . , there is no sign of a dramatic trend toward greater support.’”50 In addition, they acknowledged that “every statewide vote but one on same-sex marriage has come down in favor of prohibition, usually by substantial margins.”51 Likewise, a December 2009 survey reported by Angus Reid found that forty-six percent of Americans oppose same-sex marriage compared to forty-three percent who favor it.52                                                                                                                            put on the ballot in 2010.

Again, the action appears to have been rammed through by politicians ignoring the will of a significant part of the people. “A poll conducted in May for same-sex marriage supporters found that whites in the District back same-sex marriage by more than 8 to 1, while blacks were against it 48 percent to 34 percent.”53 In a follow-up poll in January 2010, opposition to same-sex marriage among black Americans had risen to fifty-one percent compared to thirty-seven percent in favor, while white citizens supported same-sex marriage by eighty-three percent compared to twelve percent against it.54 Fifty-nine percent of D.C. residents, including seventy percent of black Americans in the District, favored putting the issue on the ballot so that “voters could vote yes or no on a referendum on same-sex marriage.”55 When citizens’ petitions requesting the matter be put on the ballot were presented to the District of Columbia’s Board of Elections and Ethics, the Board rejected the petitions (three separate times) with the curious bootstrap argument that it would be in violation of the city’s anti-discrimination law to allow voters to vote for such a discriminatory rule as male-female marriage.56 (In other words, the Board believes that D.C.’s general sexual orientation non-discrimination law requires allowance of same-sex marriage, that the law also forbids allowing voters to vote on                                                                                                                             53.

Another indicator of continuing public sentiment opposed to legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States is the continuing effort to enact constitutional protections for conjugal marriage. As noted earlier, thirty states already have adopted amendments to their state constitutions in order to explicitly define the institution of legal marriage as the union of a man and a woman.57 Those thirty states can be described as the “low hanging fruit” in the sense that the people in most of those states tend to be conservative on most social issues; thus, getting popular support for the passage of a constitutional amendment embodying their inherently conservative common vision of marriage was not surprising.58 The remaining twenty states that do not have a marriage amendment either are not inherently conservative states or have existing political power structures that are controlled by persons or political groups who have strongly pro-same-sex-marriage positions. Yet even in those remaining states, there are continued efforts to enact constitutional amendments to protect civil marriage as a conjugal (male-female) institution. Since the beginning of 2010, efforts to enact state marriage amendments or bills have been launched in many of these states, including Iowa,59 New Hampshire,60 Maryland,61 West Virginia,62 Illinois,63 Indiana,64 and Rhode Island.65                                                                                                                             57. See supra note 14 and accompanying text; see infra Appendix B.1.  58. However, not all states that have adopted constitutional marriage amendments are generally considered to be conservative. For example, California, Hawaii, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are generally considered liberal states, but they have adopted state constitutional marriage amendments by popular vote.  59.

For example, in all fifty-seven nations comprising the inter-governmental Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as in many other nations where Muslims are a significant minority, opposition to same-sex marriage is overwhelming. Same-sex marriage is not allowed in any of the nearly five dozen Muslim nations, which comprise nearly one-third of the nations on the earth;71 furthermore, acceptance of same-sex marriage in these countries is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future.72 Elsewhere outside of Europe and North America, opposition to same-sex marriage is strong as well. In January 2010, Angus Reid reported that polls in Argentina show that only thirty-five percent of Argentineans surveyed favored same-sex marriage, while sixty percent opposed it.73 Likewise, in an April 2009 Angus Reid report, less than one-third of Chileans favored legalizing same-sex marriage, and sixty-five percent opposed it.74 A 2008                                                                                                                             68.

Opposition to same-sex marriage is generally adamant in nations in these global regions as well.77 III.  A HOUSE DIVIDED: THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF CONJUGAL MARRIAGE AND SAME-SEX MARRIAGE The “house-divided” metaphor, which is derived from the Bible78 and was made popular by President Lincoln,79 is aptly applicable to the situation that the United States now faces with some of its states defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman, while others are defining marriage broadly as the union of any two people, including those of the same gender.                                                                                                                             75.

For example, a state that permits same-sex marriage may or may not have policies that also attempt to accommodate the rights of officials who conscientiously object to same-sex marriage.80 Both conservative and liberal legal scholars have predicted that the legalization of same-sex marriage will lead to clashes between the civil liberties of those who advocate or enter same-sex marriage and those who do not support same-sex marriage. Perhaps the most poignant examples of such civil liberties conflicts and potential realignments involve legal claims by members of the LGBT communities against religious organizations, employees, as well as individual members of religious faiths that oppose same-sex marriage. For example, religious institutions in the United States that refuse to recognize same-sex marriage may face significant potential civil liability and litigation risk under employment antidiscrimination laws, fair housing laws, and public accommodation laws.81 They may also risk loss of government privileges and benefits including tax-exempt status, exclusion from eligibility for social service contracts, exclusion from government facilities and grounds, and exclusion from solemnizing marriages.82 Moreover, they may face potential civil and criminal liability for violating “hate crimes” and “hate speech” laws.83 But churches and their agents and agencies are not the only ones at risk. Private individuals, who for reasons of faith or conscience do not wish to facilitate or endorse same-sex marriages, risk exclusion from eligibility for employment (by non-hiring and firing) in civil service positions that involve licensure or the solemnization of marriage.84 In addition, individuals may face alleged civil rights violations and penalties as well.                                                                                                                             80.

The Intensifying Conflict Between Same-Sex Marriage and the Civil Liberties of Those Who Do Not Support Same-Sex Marriage While this dilemma is global (at least in North America and Europe), this paper focuses on civil liberties conflicts in the United States only. A few examples illustrate the dilemma.86 After Californian voters passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage (identified as “Proposition 8” on the ballot), supporters of Proposition 8 were vilified and harassed.87 Mormons, in particular, were singled out and widely blamed by homosexual activists for the passage of the amendment;88 names and addresses of Mormons and others who donated to efforts supporting the passage of Proposition 8 were published on the internet,89 resulting in a                                                                                                                             85.

For example, more than fourteen months after the election, the Mayor of Oakland, California, announced that he was putting on hold the reappointment of a long-time, distinguished Mormon community leader, Lorenzo Hoopes, to the Board that oversees Oakland’s historic Paramount Theatre, because Hoopes had contributed money for the passage of Proposition 8. Mr. Hoopes had been a member of the board for three decades.97 The threats extend beyond particular religious groups being disfavored by the homosexual community. All citizens who do not wish to legalize same-sex unions, and particularly those who wish to work for the government, face serious conscience dilemmas. For example, after the Goodridge decision in Massachusetts, all Massachusetts justices of the peace had the legal duty to marry all persons who legally applied to be married, including same-sex couples, because neither the Massachusetts legislature nor the Supreme Judicial Court had authorized any exception for conscience or religious objectors; they could be sued for discrimination if they did not marry same-sex couples.98 Thus, shortly after same-sex                                                                                                                             97.

Interestingly, law professor Douglas Laycock disagreed with the Massachusetts governor’s legal counsel: Weddings are not really part of a judge’s job. A judge has the authority to marry people, but generally no obligation to marry anybody . . . . There is no doubt that such a judge [who marries someone] is exercising state authority, vested in him in his capacity as a judge, but that is not conclusive; under existing marriage law a clergyman performing a wedding is also exercising state authority. I think that even for a judge, there is such a strong element of personal discretion in presiding over a wedding that it is entirely appropriate to respect his feelings of moral responsibility . . . .

Several county clerks attempted to make accommodations for deputy county clerks who did not wish to issue licenses to homosexual couples to marry, with mixed results. A Los Angeles Times survey of all fifty-eight counties in California revealed that twenty-three counties allowed or did not ban county employees from opting out of officiating at same-sex marriages, while employees were not allowed to opt out or there were no reported employee objections in thirty-five counties.100 Some states allow at least some public employees to decline to perform same-sex marriages. For example, in Connecticut, where justices of the peace reportedly “can refuse to perform a civil union just like they can opt not to do a wedding, for whatever reason[,]” 101 many decline to officiate or participate.102 Likewise, Vermont, the first state to legalize civil unions, also apparently gives its elected Justices of the Peace discretion to decide whether to perform civil unions.103 In Iowa, however, after the state supreme court legalized same-sex marriage by judicial decree, there were some rumblings of discontent                                                                                                                            Pundit Review, Mitt Romney, Not the Mass Supreme Judicial Court, Imposed Gay Marriage on the Citizens of Massachusetts, http://www.punditreview.com/2007/11/romney-violated-his-constitutional-oath-by-facilitating-same-sex-marriage-in-massachusetts (Nov. 20, 2007, 12:19 AM); MassResistance.org, Timeline Documents Romney’s Role in Creating Same-Sex “Marriages,” http://www.massresistance.org/docs/marriage/romney/timeline.html (last visited May 13, 2010).  99.

Thus, legal actions have been taken against religious bodies, for declining to rent facilities for same-sex union ceremonies105 and for firing a youth minister who performed a same-sex union ceremony in violation of church doctrine.106 In New Mexico, a Christian couple who operated a marriage photography business were charged by a human rights tribunal, found guilty of violating the law, and forced to pay over $6,600 for the complainant’s attorney’s fees because they declined on grounds of religious principle to photograph the civil commitment ceremony of a lesbian couple.107 The incidents continue to multiply.

In Massachusetts, for example, a man claimed he was fired because he told his coworker that he thought same-sex marriage was wrong.110 Similarly, a Maine news reporter claimed he was fired for sending a personal email that was critical of a same-sex marriage support group’s reference to “lies” and “hate” in a statement they made regarding the state’s voter-rejected same-sex marriage law.111 Also in Maine, a school counselor who made an ad supporting the “people’s veto” of the same-sex marriage bill passed by the legislature had a complaint filed against him seeking to revoke his license.112 Thus, in the wake of the movement to legalize same-sex marriage and marriage-equivalent unions, there have been increasing threats to, and diminution of, religious liberty, which have resulted in an enormous erosion of respect for the tolerance and protection of fundamental human rights.

Martinez case now pending before the Supreme Court of the United States exemplifies that challenge.116 In September 2004, the Christian Legal Society (CLS) student chapter at Hastings Law School applied to school officials to exempt the group and other religious student organizations from portions of the university’s nondiscrimination policy, which would force the chapter to allow persons who hold beliefs and engage in conduct contrary to the CLS Statement of Faith, which includes a prohibition against extramarital sex, to join as voting members and to run for officer positions.117 School officials not only denied this request, but they also stripped the chapter of its recognition and benefits, including student activity fee funding.118 On October 22, 2004, the CLS filed a lawsuit against the school officials who denied recognition to                                                                                                                             113.

In this litigation, the interests of the people of California, who passed the resulting state constitutional amendment, are not being defended by either the Attorney General or the Governor, whose jobs are to see that the laws are faithfully protected and defended.128 Those politicians have refused to defend the marriage amendment because they favor same-sex marriage. Thus, the voters (including voters of faith) have already been stripped of their civil rights by the refusal of state officials to defend the law because of their personal policy preferences.129 One experienced attorney who has followed this issue for a long time to protect the interests of his client, a church, stated of the plaintiff’s complaint: “[T]hey essentially claim that the voters, from whom all authority in a democracy flows, may not consider religious views and values when deciding these alleged social and cultural civil rights. “These are serious allegations and represent an arrow directly at the heart not only of traditional marriage but at the place of religion and religious views in the political dialogue of this country.”130 So the beat goes on.

B. The Weak Rationale for Subordinating Religious Liberty The basic idea underlying the legal claims against persons of faith who do not wish to facilitate LGBT persons at all times and in all places or situations is quite simple. Just as persons who oppose interracial marriage are not allowed to discriminate on that basis in their “public” life (including their activities involving hiring, firing, employment, housing, offering market services and public accommodations, education, or government-regulated activities), so also persons who oppose same-sex marriage should not be allowed to discriminate on that basis in their “public” life.131 Both groups of persons are called “bigots,” and while the law will not punish them for their bigoted beliefs, neither should the law allow them to discriminate against and hurt others by acting upon their bigoted beliefs. Professor Chai Feldblum, a fine legal scholar and active lesbian rights advocate, wrote that it will be appropriate to “burden[] belief by regulating conduct” in order to protect the liberties of gays and lesbians.132 She acknowledges that “those who advocate for LGBT equality have downplayed the impact of such laws on some people’s religious beliefs . . . .”133 Thus, she advocates: “Protecting one group’s [sexual] identity liberty may, at times, require that we burden others’ belief liberties.” 134 She further explains: [F]or all my sympathy for the evangelical Christian couple who may wish to run a bed and breakfast from which they can exclude unmarried straight couples and all gay couples, this is a point where I believe an inevitable choice between liberties must come into play. In making that choice, I believe society should come down on the side of protecting the identity liberty of                                                                                                                             131.

Once an individual chooses to enter the stream of economic commerce by opening a commercial establishment, I believe it is legitimate to require that they play by certain rules. . . . Just as we do not tolerate private racial beliefs that adversely affect African-Americans in the commercial arena, even if such beliefs are based on religious views, we should similarly not tolerate private beliefs about sexual orientation and gender identity that adversely affect the ability of LGBT people to live in the world.135 Except for persons in leadership positions of churches and religiously-affiliated organizations, Professor Feldblum advocates that religious liberty must give way to sexual identity liberty.136 Professor Feldblum’s justification for subordinating religious liberty to sexual identity liberty is a sophisticated variation of the justification for affirmative action for racial minorities—reverse racial discrimination to overcome the effects of past racial discrimination. She argues that because religious liberty has allowed discrimination and subordination of sexual identity liberty for so many decades and centuries, and because we now, so belatedly, realize how crucially important sexual identity liberty is to homosexuals, bisexuals, and transgendered persons, subordination of religious liberty to sexual identity liberty is necessary to finally allow sexual identity liberty to blossom fully, and to facilitate its practitioners’ full participation in our democratic republic.137 However, this analysis fails for two reasons. First, there is an explicit and unequivocal commitment in the Constitution’s text to reject racial discrimination, but there is not any clear constitutional text or consensus to give preferential protection to same-sex relations. Thus, as Judge Smith of the New York Court of Appeals wrote in Hernandez v. Robles,138 in rejecting the Loving analogy: [T]he historical background of Loving is different from the history underlying this case.

By contrast, no text or history shows anything establishing the alleged sexual identity liberty, and as Appendix B.1 shows, the clear constitutional consensus in the United States unquestionably rejects such a claim.141 Second, racial discrimination involves an immutable biological condition; sexual identity liberty is different.142 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., knew the difference and expressed it in his famous “I Have a Dream” speech in Washington, D.C. when he said: “I have a dream my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the                                                                                                                             139.

C. The Incompatibility of Dual-Gender Marriage and Same-Sex Marriage Regimes The incidents described above provide proof of the incompatibility of traditional marriage (dual-gender legal unions) and same-sex marriage. But why? What is the reason for this incompatibility? The answer has to do with irreconcilable visions of the boundaries, meaning, and purposes of legal marriage. In order to prevent the chaos of anarchy and a social “tragedy of the commons,” there needs to be some notion of what marriage is, some definition of the boundaries of the institution.144 Societies create institutions that embody such boundaries and definitions in order to stabilize society. “Formal institutions are codified rules and informal institutions are unwritten rules and norms. Both formal and informal institutions play important roles in governing the commons.”145 Social expectations about marriage and the legal definition and regulation of marriage are classic examples of how society and government use what Elinor Ostrom called the “design principles [of] long-enduring institutions.”146 Dual-gender marriage has for centuries, even millennia, defined the nature of and been essential to the purposes (especially the procreative and child-rearing purposes) of the institution.147 Dual-gender marriage has provided a clear boundary for distinguishing marriage from other intimate relationships148 and has protected the investment of those entering the marital family institution by controlling the rules for entry into and exit from that institution.149 In addition, dual-gender marriage has provided familiarity,                                                                                                                             143.

These conflicts reflect differing visions and competing opportunities. When the institution at issue is as crucial to society as the institution of dual-gender marriage, the intensity of the conflicts increases. The qualities and characteristics, as well as the purposes and uses, of the institution of marriage vary dramatically. If same-sex marriage is integrated into society, the institution of marriage will shift and transform to accommodate the purposes, qualities, and behaviors of the parties who are in the institution of marriage. What is considered “marriage” for purposes of including same-sex couples will bear little resemblance to what historically has been considered “marriage” (as limited to dual-gender unions).153                                                                                                                             150.

The author states: Redefining marriage to include gay and lesbian couples will have a profound impact upon sexual morality in society. Sexual standards will change as homosexual relations will be instantly normalized and equated with marital relations. . . . Legalizing same-sex marriage will instantly transform the meaning of marriage, spouse, husband, wife, parent, [and] child in the law. Id.; see also Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub.

Justice Sosman argues: The Legislature . . . may, as the creator of the institution of civil marriage, wish to see the proof before making a fundamental alteration to that institution.  . . . .  [I]t is rational for the Legislature to postpone any redefinition of marriage that would include same-sex couples until such time as it is certain that that redefinition will not have unintended and undesirable social consequences. 2010] A HOUSE DIVIDED 571   Conjugal marriage is the principal social institution designed to channel human sexual expression into responsible, socially constructive outlets.154 Sex between a married man and woman who are (and have been) chaste before marriage and faithful to their marriage vows during marriage is medically the safest and healthiest form of sex, psychologically the most secure and fulfilling form of sex, and emotionally the most fulfilling, enjoyable, and satisfying kind of sex.155 It provides the optimal setting in which children can be conceived, born, nurtured, and raised.156 The qualities of spousal integrity and sexual fidelity in marriage will be transformed by including same-sex couples in the institution of marriage. Institutions like marriage in a democratic society can accommodate some “free riders” living in alternative relationships. Some modest deviation in quantity or quality from the norm of dual-gender marriage and sexual fidelity within marriage is not seriously threatening to the institution. However, when the quality or quantity of those deviations is so significant and the nature of the changes alter the very core architecture of the institutional structure, the “free-riders” no longer merely mildly burden the institution; instead, they threaten to undermine and overthrow the                                                                                                                            Id. at 980, 982; see also id. at 987, 990, 996-97, 1003 (Cordy, J., dissenting). Justice Cordy acknowledges: More macroscopically, construction of a family through marriage also formalizes the bonds between people in an ordered and institutional manner, thereby facilitating a foundation of interconnectedness and interdependency on which more intricate stabilizing social structures might be built.  . . . .  It is difficult to imagine a State purpose more important and legitimate than ensuring, promoting, and supporting an optimal social structure within which to bear and raise children. At the very least, the marriage statute [at issue in Goodridge] continues to serve this important State purpose. Id. at 996-97 (citation omitted).  154. Poe v.

The qualitative differences between the nature of dual-gender marriages and the nature of same-sex relationships and marriages are many, deep, and profound. For example, the differences in sexual behaviors and expectations between same-sex couples and married dual-gender couples are so substantial that a profound distortion of the sexual mores associated with the institution of marriage is inevitable if same-sex couples are included in that institution.157 Male-female marriage holds strongly and generally adheres to the standard model of complete and exclusive sexual fidelity between the spouses.158 However, sexual non-exclusivity and sexual partners outside of the marriage characterize same-sex unions, including same-sex marriages.159 A January 2010 New York Times article reported: New research at San Francisco State University reveals just how common open relationships are among gay men and lesbians in the Bay Area. The Gay Couples Study has followed 556 male couples for three years—about 50 percent of those surveyed have sex outside their relationships, with the knowledge and approval of their partners.160 The story also noted that: None of this is news in the gay community, but few will speak publicly about it. Of the dozen people in open relationships contacted for this column, no one would agree to use his or her full name, citing privacy concerns. They also worried that discussing the subject could undermine the legal fight for same-sex marriage.161                                                                                                                             157.

For example, a landmark study by Dutch AIDS researchers, which was published in 2003 in the AIDS journal, reported on the number of partners among Amsterdam’s homosexual population.162 These researchers, who are supportive of homosexuality and come from the most homosexual-affirming nation in the world, found that eighty-six percent of new HIV/AIDS infections in homosexual men were in men who had steady partners.163 The study also found that homosexual men with steady partners engage in more risky sexual behaviors than homosexuals without steady partners;164 homosexual men without a steady partner had, on average, twenty-two casual partners per year, and homosexual men with steady partners had, on average, eight other sex partners (“casual partners”) per year.165 More than a decade ago, researchers studying the sexual behaviors of 2,583 older, sexually active, homosexual men reported that “the modal range for [the] number of male sexual partners ever was 101-500,” while 10.2% to 15.7% had between 501 and 1,000 partners, and another 10.2% to 15.7% reported having had more than one thousand sexual partners in their lifetime.166 In 1989, Kirk and Madsen acknowledged that “the cheating ratio of ‘married’ gay males, given enough time, approaches 100%. . . . Many gay lovers, bowing to the inevitable, agree to an ‘open relationship,’ for which there are as many sets of ground rules as there are couples.”167 Likewise, a 1984 study of 156 homosexual male couples by McWhirter and Mattison found that while seventy-three percent of the couples had an expectation of exclusive sexual fidelity when they entered into their                                                                                                                             162.

Many couples learn very early in their relationship that ownership of each other sexually can become the greatest internal threat to their staying together.”169 Similarly, in their groundbreaking 1978 book reporting on homosexual behaviors, researchers Bell and Weinberg reported that forty-three percent of white male homosexuals had sex with five hundred or more partners, with twenty-eight percent having one thousand or more sex partners.170 Thus, it is not surprising that contemporary research (and even the New York Times) concedes that multi-partner sexual relations by same-sex couples are an “open secret” in many same-sex couple relationships.171 The standard of exclusive sexual fidelity between spouses cannot survive as a social expectation for marriage if marriage is altered to include types of relationships—at least half of—whose adherents flaunt that standard. Marriage quality and the quality of marital life in societies where infidelity is accepted in marriage is profoundly different from the quality of marriages and marital life in societies in which fidelity is expected.172 Society also needs a critical mass of married, two-parent families, who will raise their own children well and also serve as models for children growing up in alternative family structures. That is another reason why same-sex marriage is incompatible with dual-gender marriage, and another way in which it endangers our social system. The legalization of same-sex marriage will legitimize and normalize an alternative form of marital parenting that will subvert the effectiveness of, and eventually erode, the critical social institution of dual-gender marriage and dual-gender marital parenting.173 If you want to see real gender wars and extremely hostile                                                                                                                             168.

The major means by which this metamorphosis of the morality of marriage would occur can be called “the transformative power of inclusion.” That refers to the impact upon the morality of the institution of marriage that would follow the redefinition of marriage to include same-sex couples. Conservative advocates of same-sex marriage have long argued that legalization of same-sex marriage will positively influence the life-styles of gays and lesbians because the morality of marriage will rub off on and “tame” the behaviors of same-sex couples. . . . [Regardless of the validity of that claim,] the transformative effects of inclusion work both ways. The moral qualities and characteristics of homosexual unions and lifestyles will have [a] distorting effect upon the existing morality of marriage. That modification of the morality of marriage to make it more gay-like could seriously harm . . . society, families, and individuals.175 The transformation of marriage is not a trifling matter because the institution of marriage is the most important source of the most important moral standards in our society. As the Supreme Court noted, marriage “giv[es] character to our whole civil polity.”176 The Court declared that the institution of marriage “is the foundation of the family and of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.”177                                                                                                                             174.

PROTECTION OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN IS A BASIC CIVIL RIGHT Marriage between a man and a woman is a basic civil right, and redefinition of marriage to include same-gender couples fundamentally dilutes and destroys that basic civil right. Dual-gender marriage is an integral thread woven into the fabric of our society and our legal structure. Same-sex unions do not contribute comparably to the needs, infrastructure, and social capital of society.178 A. Human Dignity For example, human dignity is based upon and enhanced by dual-gendered marriage and marital families.179 Human Dignity has at least three dimensions: (1) Universal—Natural (e.g., all are brothers/sisters);  (2) Internal Confidence—Derived from morality, excellence, and adherence to high standards; and (3) External Recognition—Respect of others. Dual-gender marriage and marital families are the cornerstones of human dignity in all three dimensions: (1) Conjugal (male-female) marriage is ubiquitous in history and around the world. It is a social unit that connects us with all humanity across cultures and throughout history.180                                                                                                                             178.

They have a sense of earned and deserved self-worth. They also have the dignity that comes from adherence to moral standards (including standards of sexual morality) that engender dignity. (3) Individuals raised in stable, loving (dual-gender marital) families also are most likely to respect others. They need not feel driven to demean or subordinate others to feel valued or significant. They have acquired their sense of what anthropologists call “kinship identity” in the marital home.181 Children raised by same-sex partners are denied at least half of this critical self-understanding. Marital families are not infallible or perfect. There are failures, but there are also norms and expectations that benefit society. Likewise, all family forms are not equal in qualities or consequences. Married male-female couples and conjugally married families provide the greatest protections and benefits for dignity to families, society, all individuals, and especially children. Marital families with mothers and fathers are the primary social institutions that foster the conditions in which respect for human dignity can develop and thrive. This is because the morality fostered by male-female marriage differs significantly from morality fostered by same-sex unions. Marriage is perhaps the single most important morality-shaping social institution. B. Marriage and Virtue: The Substructure of Our Legal Superstructure and Liberties Protection of dual-gender marriage has profound structural significance for our Constitution.

It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”186 James Madison likewise declared: “To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.”187 Marriage and marital families were viewed as essential structures for cultivating civic or republican virtue.188 The Founders understood that certain non-governmental institutions—family and churches, in particular—are crucial for the development and fostering of virtue. Marital families are the first schoolrooms of republican self-government, the small republics that comprise and constitute the large political republic. In the founding era, the family was considered one of the essential “pillars of republican                                                                                                                            at http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/elliot/elliotvolume3.pdf (last visited May 13, 2010).  183.

John Adams wrote: The foundation of national morality must be laid in private families. . . . How is it possible that Children can have any just Sense of the sacred Obligations of Morality or Religion if, from their earliest Infancy, they learn their Mothers live in habitual Infidelity to their fathers, and their fathers in as constant Infidelity to their Mothers?190 Likewise, George Mason argued that republican government was based on an affection “for altars and firesides.” Only good men could be free; men learned how to be good in a variety of local institutions—by the firesides as well as at the altar. . . . [The Founders believed that] [i]ndividuals learned virtue in their families, churches, and schools.191 In this view, the Founders were merely reflecting widely held republican precepts. For instance, Montesquieu, the most frequently cited political writer in America during the Founding decade of 1780-89 suggested “that marriage and the form of government were mirrors of each other. Accepting Montesquieu’s perspective, American revolutionaries and their descendants understood marriage and the family to be schools of republican virtue.”192                                                                                                                             189.

Professor Nancy Cott has observed that “[i]n the beginning of the United States, the founders had a political theory of marriage. So deeply embedded in political assumptions that it was rarely voiced as a theory, it was all the more important. It occupied the place where political theory overlapped with common sense.”194 Thus, the Founders deliberately provided “legal supports for the family,” which were “important elements in the stability of marriage.”195 Shortly after the founding of the American Republic, the perceptive French social commentator, Alexis de Tocqueville, observed that “[t]he feeling [a citizen] entertains toward the state is analogous to that which unites him to his family.”196 He also declared: There is certainly no country in the world where the tie of marriage is so much respected as in America, or where conjugal happiness is more highly or worthily appreciated. . . . [T]he American derives from his own home that love of order, which he afterward carries with him into public affairs.197 Perhaps the most emphatic connection between the Constitution and family life was described by Tocqueville’s contemporary, Francis Grund, when he observed: I consider the domestic virtue of the Americans as the principal source of all their other qualities. . . . No government could be established on the same principle as that of the United States, with a different code of morals. The American Constitution is remarkable for its simplicity; but it can only suffice a people habitually correct in their actions, and would be utterly inadequate to the wants of a different nation.                                                                                                                             193.

The male-female marital family was the institutional cornerstone of the substructure of the superstructure of our Constitution and system of legal rights and liberties. The weakening and dilution of the marital family thus will alter and endanger the Constitution and our civil rights and liberties. C. Preventing the Concentration of Power: The Federalist Dimension of Marriage Marriage and the marital family are “mediating structures” that stand between the vulnerable individual and the overwhelming, alienating power of the corporate government. Mediating structures are “the value-generating and value-maintaining agencies in society.”199 “These mediating structures or ‘communities’ that mediate between the individual and the state or the market need nourishing . . . .”200 The Founders understood that certain non-governmental institutions were essential to foster the kind of citizenship necessary to support a democratic republic. The Founders believed that religion was the source of virtue and morality, and that certain non-governmental “institutions—family, school, churches, neighborhood, and other local institutions, were, in fact, the primary feeders and stimulators of the general civil religion.”201 The marital family was one of the critical institutions in which civic virtue would be generated and regenerated.                                                                                                                             198.

Because they understood the bases of virtue to be primarily moral rather than political, early Americans believed that the state should promote other institutions, especially the public worship and private instruction of religion, in which virtue would be directly inculcated. In addition to promoting religion, people generally believed the main task of government was to foster and protect the multitude of associations in which proper character was formed.202 The marital family was the most “local” of local communities, the ultimate “little platoon,” to borrow a phrase from Edmund Burke.203 Because of their distrust of the concentration of power, the Founders did not want the national government to control the generation of public or civic virtue necessary to sustain a republican form of (self-) government. Rather, applying their federalism principles of the dispersal of power, the Founders denied that control to the national government and left it to other institutions. The Constitution ensured that “the development of virtue, to a great extent, had been removed from the political realm to these other institutions of society as a separation between society and government had evolved.”204 The responsibility to nurture virtue, so essential to the preservation of the Constitution, was dispersed to the local states and their communities and to the non-governmental institutions—particularly to marital families and to churches (and to schools, which at the time primarily were instruments of those families and churches).205 Consistent with federalism principles, empowering the institutions of marriage and the marital family reduced the potential for abuse of power by the national government.                                                                                                                             202.

Thus, the central government was not given authority to nurture virtue; in fact, a specific provision authorizing Congress to establish institutions of higher education was even stripped from the Constitution.

CONCLUSION: STAND UP FOR OUR BASIC CIVIL  RIGHTS OF FAITH AND FAMILY I have just scratched the surface of this subject. Had I further space and time, I would also discuss protection of the institution of conjugal marriage as a fundamental right of association protected by the First Amendment. Implicit in the First Amendment’s explicit guarantees is a fundamental right of association that includes at the most basic level the right of marital and familial association. Ironically, even free speech is endangered by some of the zealous advocates of same-sex marriage.206 We are engaged in one of the great civil rights battles of our nation’s history. The public policy debate over legalizing same-sex marriage is the defining issue of this generation. The outcome matters greatly because marriage is the basic unit of society. Protection of marriage is a core civil right. Men and women are still different, and the union of two men or two women is still different from the union of a man and a woman. That is what this contest is about—recognition of the difference. This Symposium occurs just a few days before our nation celebrates the birthday of George Washington, the first President of the United States and “Father” of our nation. In a letter to the Members of the New Church in Baltimore, Maryland, dated January 27, 1793, President Washington wrote: We have abundant reason to rejoice, that, in this land, the light of truth and reason has triumphed over the power of bigotry and superstition, and that every person may here worship God according to the dictates of his own heart. In this enlightened age, and in this land of equal liberty, it is our boast, that a man’s religious tenets will not forfeit the protection of the laws, nor deprive him of the right of attaining and holding the highest offices that are known in the United States.207 Today, those precious religious liberties Washington celebrated are endangered by courts and legislatures across the land. Today, anti-religious bigotry has reared its threatening head again. It is time to recognize the danger and to work to restore protection for religious liberty, recognizing its value the way Washington did. It is time for another founding of the American dream and of the American constitutional republic. As Dallin Oaks put it:                                                                                                                             206. See supra Part III.A.  207.

The supporters of Proposition 8 were exercising their constitutional right to defend the institution of marriage—an institution of transcendent importance that they, along with countless others of many persuasions, feel conscientiously obliged to protect.208 We must use our legal talents and our time, energy, and resources to stand up for our basic civil rights. This battle to protect our faith and our families is going to be long and difficult, so this is not the time for sunshine soldiers or weekend warriors. We must get involved, persist, and endure. May we all continue to develop and more diligently use the very best professional skills in the service of this cause.                                                                                                                             208.
